"The chief executive of Goldman Sachs, Lloyd Blankfein, has suggested holding another referendum on Brexit. Mr Blankfein tweeted: ""Here in UK, lots of hand-wringing from CEOs over #Brexit... So much at stake, why not make sure consensus still there?"" The firm, which is known to have taken office space in Frankfurt, employs about 6,000 people in London. Banks are particularly worried the UK will fail to strike an EU trade deal. The banks fear that after Britain leaves the EU their businesses will lose ""passporting rights"", which allows them to sell financial services across borders. Mr Blankfein's tweet went on to say: ""Better sense of the tough and risky road ahead. Reluctant to say, but many wish for a confirming vote on a decision so monumental and irreversible.

Mr Blankfein's twitter account was barely used until recently. Despite him signing up to the microblogging service in 2011 he only sent his first tweet in June - and since then has shared his thoughts in that way just 26 times. Nevertheless, he has attracted 69,000 followers. His previously most noticeable tweet - sent last month - was also Brexit-related: ""Just left Frankfurt. Great meetings, great weather, really enjoyed it. Good, because I'll be spending a lot more time there. #Brexit"". That was seen as a hint that Frankfurt would become a key European base for the Wall Street giant post-Brexit. Last month, the Wall Street bank said it had agreed to lease office space at a new building in Frankfurt giving it space for up to 1,000 staff. That would be five times the current staff of 200 and see the Wall Street giant bolstering activities including trading, investment banking and asset management. The bank is also thought to be looking at expanding its operation in Paris. Mr Blankfein was in London attending a client event. A spokesman for Goldman Sachs said the bank had nothing further to add to Mr Blankfein's comments.

"Seventy one victims of the Grenfell Tower fire have been formally identified and police believe that all those who died have now been recovered. The number of victims includes baby Logan Gomes, who was stillborn in hospital on 14 June, the day the 24-storey blaze broke out. The final two victims to be formally identified have been named as Victoria King and daughter Alexandra Atala. The Met said it was providing ""every support we can"" to the bereaved. Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? Visual guide to the Grenfell Tower fire Inside the 21st floor of the Grenfell Tower fire Metropolitan Police Commander Stuart Cundy said: ""I have been clear from the start that a priority for us was recovering all those who died, and identifying and returning them to their families. ""Specialist teams working inside Grenfell Tower and the mortuary have pushed the boundaries of what was scientifically possible to identify people. ""After the fire was finally put out, I entered Grenfell Tower and was genuinely concerned that due to the intensity and duration of the fire, that we may not find, recover and then identify all those who died. Victoria King, pictured, died in the flat alongside her daughter Alexandra Atala ""I know that each and every member of the team has done absolutely all they can to make this possible."" In June, the Met had a list of 400 missing people - some of whom were reported a number of times under different names or spellings, with one person in particular recorded 46 separate times. The work to investigate and locate all those reported as missing was only concluded in the last few weeks, the Met said. The family of Ms King, 71, and Ms Atala, 40, said they were ""devastated"" to learn of the pair's fate, adding that the mother and daughter were ""devoted to each other"". The original missing persons list was also made higher by fraudulent cases, police said, with some individuals attempting to benefit financially from the tragedy. There are a number of ongoing fraud investigations, and earlier this month one man pleaded guilty to fraud after claiming that his wife and son had both died in the fire. The Met is also investigating alleged thefts from seven flats at Grenfell Tower, although no perpetrators have yet been identified, according to BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw. Commander Cundy told BBC News: ""There was only one way in and out of the tower and [CCTV] footage shows 223 people came out and survived."" He said not all 223 people were residents, some were visitors, and some residents were not in the tower at the time. While the final stage of the search operation is not expected to conclude until early December, the Met said in a statement: ""Based on all the work carried out so far and the expert advice, it is highly unlikely there is anyone who remains inside Grenfell Tower"". Specially trained officers from the Met, City of London Police and British Transport Police have been involved in the search and recovery operation, thoroughly searching every single flat on every single floor. Officers have examined 15.5 tonnes of debris on each floor, helped by forensic anthropologists, archaeologists and forensic dentists or odontologists. Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims?

"Robert Mugabe met the army chief who led the move against him Zimbabwe's long-time President Robert Mugabe has been holding direct talks with the army over his future. Pictures emerged of the 93-year-old meeting the army chief and two envoys from South Africa at his official residence in Harare. The army put Mr Mugabe under house arrest on Wednesday after moving in to take control. Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai says Mr Mugabe must resign but sources suggest the president is resistant. The crisis stems from a power struggle in recent months over who might succeed him - his wife Grace Mugabe or former Vice President Emmerson Mnangagwa. Last week, Mr Mugabe came down in favour of his wife, sacking Mr Mnangagwa and provoking the ire of the army chiefs. The view from Zimbabwe: Any change will do The basics: Five things you should know about Zimbabwe The Mugabes and other key players in profile It's very unclear. Photos in the Zimbabwe Herald showed Mr Mugabe meeting army chief Gen Constantino Chiwenga,externaland the two South African envoys from the Southern African Development Community (Sadc) at State House in Harare. Alongside them was Father Fidelis Mukonori, a Roman Catholic priest known to Mr Mugabe for years, who has been brought in to mediate. Sources close to the talks say Mr Mugabe - who has been in control of Zimbabwe since it threw off white minority rule in 1980 - is refusing to stand down voluntarily before next year's planned elections. This video can not be played Who is Grace Mugabe? ""He is refusing to step down. I think he is trying to buy time,"" one source close to the army leadership told the AFP news agency. Zanu-PF officials had earlier suggested Mr Mugabe could remain nominally in power until the party congress in December, when Mr Mnangagwa would be formally installed as party and national leader. By Anne Soy in Zimbabwe Many Zimbabweans almost instantly warmed to the military's move to take control of the country, and confine President Mugabe to his official residence. ""The military has done a good thing,"" says one bookseller. ""They will ensure we get a transitional government."" He is firmly convinced that Mr Mugabe's 37-year rule is coming to an end. There has been a sudden change of tone in the country, and the sense is that many Zimbabweans have been yearning for change. Any change, it seems, would do.

South African Defence Minister Nosiviwe Maphisa-Nqakula and State Security Minister Bongani Bongo are the envoys meeting Mr Mugabe on behalf of Sadc, which South Africa currently leads.

The body, which represents 16 countries, does not support coup-led governments as this would set a dangerous precedent in the largely peaceful region, says the BBC's Pumza Fihlani in Johannesburg. The head of the African Union (AU), Guinean President Alpha CondÃ©, was clear the AU would ""in no case accept"" a military seizure of power. He said he was ""inviting the army to return to its barracks and return to constitutional order"". Mr Tsvangirai,head of the Movement for Democratic Change-Tsvangirai (MDC-T) partyand the main opposition leader in Zimbabwe, said on Thursday: ""In the interests of the people, Mr Robert Mugabe must resign... immediately."" Mr Tsvangirai, who has been abroad receiving treatment for cancer, also called for a ""negotiated all-inclusive transitional mechanism"" that would lead to ""comprehensive reforms for free and fair elections to be held"". This has been echoed by another Zimbabwean opposition leader, Tendai Biti, who also spoke of the need for a ""transitional period"". This video can not be played Andrew Harding: ""There's a feeling people want to celebrate"" Early reports suggested Mrs Mugabe had fled to Namibia, but sources now say she is in the family compound along with senior figures from the ""Generation-40"" group that backs her - cabinet ministers Jonathan Moyo and Saviour Kasukuwere. On Wednesday, one of her key allies, Zanu-PF youth wing leader Kudzai Chipanga, made a televised apology for criticising the head of the army as a war of words raged prior to the military takeover. Mr Chipanga is thought to be in army custody but insisted his statement was voluntary. Local media reports say a number of other senior members of the ""Generation-40"" group have also been detained. What next for Robert Mugabe? Why did the army act now? How to tell if you're in a coup In the early hours of Wednesday, Zimbabwe's military took over the headquarters of national broadcaster ZBC and issued a statement saying they were targeting ""criminals"" around President Mugabe. Troops and armoured vehicles encircled parliament and other key buildings throughout the day. On Monday, Gen Chiwenga had warned the army would intervene to end what he called the ""purging"" of Zanu-PF members ""with a liberation background"", referring to the country's struggle for independence.

The 93-year-old was put under house arrest during a military takeover on Wednesday, after a power struggle over who would succeed him. The military said on Friday it was ""engaging"" with Mr Mugabe.

Live updates from Zimbabwe The view from the street: Any change will do The basics: Five things you should know about Zimbabwe What next for Robert Mugabe? The army moved in after Mr Mugabe last week sacked Vice-President Emmerson Mnangagwa, signalling that he favoured his wife Grace Mugabe to take over his Zanu-PF party and the presidency. If President Mugabe can be persuaded to step down officially it could help legitimise the military's dramatic intervention, the BBC's Andrew Harding reports from Zimbabwe. On the streets, it is hard to find anyone who wants Mr Mugabe to stay on, our correspondent adds, but negotiating the manner of his departure and some sort of transitional agreement to follow could take some time.

"This video can not be played Det Supt Paul Kessell said the 49-year-old is believed to be known to Gaia Police investigating the disappearance of teenager Gaia Pope have arrested a 49-year-old man on suspicion of murder. Paul Elsey, confirmed as the suspect to the BBC by his father, is from the Swanage area of Dorset. Mr Elsey, the third person to be held in the inquiry, is believed to be known to 19-year-old Gaia, who went missing from the town on Tuesday, 7 November. A search is continuing in an area where items of women's clothing were found earlier, Dorset Police said. Mr Elsey lives at the same property as his mother Rosemary Dinch, 71, who along with her 19-year-old grandson, Nathan Elsey, were arrested on suspicion of murdering Ms Pope on Monday. The pair were released on Tuesday while inquiries continue. Gaia Pope was last seen in Swanage on 7 November Det Supt Paul Kessell said the clothing was found on land near the Dorset coast path and ""a number of vehicles"" had also been seized. The officer said it was not clear who the clothes belonged to but they were ""similar"" to those which Gaia was wearing. Forensic officers are working in the area where items of clothing were found He added Gaia's family had been informed of the developments and were being supported. She was last seen nine days ago by family friend Ms Dinch in Swanage. Since Gaia's disappearance, extensive searches have been carried out in and around the resort, involving police, coastguard teams and local volunteers. Asked why the latest suspect had been arrested on suspicion of murder, Mr Kessell said: ""As you would expect, we have been conducting this inquiry for two weeks and it is our responsibility to investigate every avenue of inquiry that's open to us. ""In doing that, we continue to investigate whether Gaia has come to harm through an act of crime or whether she is missing and we will continue to do so."" He appealed directly to the public to come forward if they have any information or have had any contact with Gaia since she went missing. Police cordoned off an area of land, north of the coast path after items of women's clothing were found Gaia, who has severe epilepsy, is thought to have gone missing without her medication. Earlier, her father Richard Sutherland told the BBC the support from the community in the search had been ""heart warming"". ""It's been beautiful, it keeps us going. To feel that strength of everyone helping us - every bit of help is gratefully received and she's worth every bit of it,"" he said. On Wednesday police released CCTV images of Gaia at a petrol station shortly before she went missing.

"Mr Davis laughed off a question about the UK being prepared to pay 60bn euros for financial obligations David Davis has warned against ""putting politics above prosperity"" in Britain's post-Brexit relationship with the EU. In a speech in Berlin, the UK's Brexit Secretary outlined his hopes for a deal that ""allows for the freest possible trade in goods and services"". He also said he thought it ""incredibly unlikely"" there would be no deal. The EU says negotiations cannot move on to trade until questions about the UK ""divorce bill"", citizens' rights and Northern Ireland are resolved. All you need to know about Brexit Who does UK trade with on WTO rules? BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said Mr Davis's speech was delivered politely but implied ""pretty significant frustrations on the UK side with the EU's attitude"". In a question and answer session following the speech, a German interviewer got a round of applause for suggesting the UK government looked to be ""in chaos"". Mr Davis replied: ""One of the issues in modern politics is that all governments have periods of turbulence. ""This is a period of turbulence, it will pass."" In his speech to an economic conference organised by the German newspaper SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung, he said trade between Germany and the UK was worth 176bn euros a year or ""more than a thousand euros to every man, woman and child in each of our countries"". He said the ""close economic ties"" with the EU ""should continue, if not strengthen"" after Brexit, and he warned: ""Putting politics above prosperity is never a smart choice"". The UK was seeking a ""deep and comprehensive free trade agreement"" of a scope the EU had never seen before as well as ""continued close co-operation in highly regulated areas such as transport, energy and data"", he said. Britain would use an independent trade policy to lead a ""race to the top on quality and standards"" rather than engage in a ""race to the bottom"" that would mean lower standards, he told the audience. He said the EU and UK needed to ""think creatively"" about their post-Brexit relationship but stressed the need for a ""time limited transition period"" to implement the new arrangements. ""And that would mean access to the UK and European markets would continue on current terms. Keeping both the rights of a European Union member and the obligations of one, such as the role of the European Court of Justice. ""That also means staying in all the EU regulators and agencies during that limited period. Which would be about two years."" He added that tariff-free trade should be maintained and there must be an ""effective dispute mechanism"" for any disputes that may arise, that should be neither the UK courts, nor the European Court of Justice. ""It must be appropriate for both sides so that it can give business the confidence it needs that this partnership will endure."" In a question and answer session following his speech, Mr Davis laughed off a question about whether the UK would be prepared to pay 60bn euros to settle its financial obligations. He said the UK's aim was that ""nobody will have to pay more ... nobody will receive less"" but would not give a figure that the UK would be prepared to pay. Asked if he thought the Brexit negotiations would end in ""no deal"", he said: ""I think that's incredibly unlikely."" While the UK government has not put a figure on the amount it is prepared to pay to settle the UK's obligations but it has been estimated at 20bn euros (about Â£18bn). The Sun newspaper reported on Thursday that the prime minister was preparing to offer an additional Â£20bn to the EU to clear the way for talks about a transitional and future trade deal. Downing Street described that as ""yet more speculation"". EU sources told the BBC last week that the UK had only two weeks left to make progress on the so-called withdrawal issues, including the amount the UK will pay as it leaves and Mr Davis's EU counterpart Michel Barnier said ""time is pressing"" to get agreement on the bill.

"Kevin Spacey said he was now seeking treatment The Old Vic theatre says it has received 20 personal testimonies of alleged inappropriate behaviour by Kevin Spacey, who was its artistic director between 2004 and 2015. Those affected said they ""felt unable to raise concerns"", and he ""operated without sufficient accountability"". The London theatresaid it ""truly apologises"",externalfor not creating a culture where people felt able to speak freely. The BBC has contacted Spacey's legal representatives for comment. The Old Vic's announcement follows recent allegations of sexual harassment and predatory behaviour made against the double Oscar winner and former House of Cards actor while at the theatre. Spacey has not responded to them. Kevin Spacey timeline: How the story unfolded The actor's behaviour was alleged to have ranged from making people feel uncomfortable to sexually inappropriate behaviour, the Old Vic investigation found. No-one alleged rape but three people told the Old Vic they had contacted the police, while 14 of the 20 complainants were told by the investigators that they should consider going to the police. There were 20 individual allegations and 16 were former staff, all of whom were men. Lewis Silkin, the external law firm engaged by the theatre to conduct the investigation, said more than half the allegations were said to have taken place inside the Old Vic. The investigation also found there was not widespread knowledge of Spacey's alleged behaviour within the organisation, the law firm said. This video can not be played Kate Varah, executive director of the Old Vic, has apologised ""wholeheartedly"" to alleged victims With the exception of one of the claims, none of the reported incidents were raised formally or informally with management. Spacey was invited to participate in the investigation but the Old Vic said he did not respond. The investigation is continuing so more people can come forward. Current artistic director Matthew Warchus said he had ""genuine and deep sympathy for all those who have come forward"". More than half the allegations received by the Old Vic were said to have taken place inside the theatre Mr Warchus added: ""Everyone is entitled to work in an environment free from harassment and intimidation. ""The Old Vic is now actively engaged in the process of healing and the process of prevention."" He described the allegations as ""a shock and a disturbing surprise to many of us"". ""It is incorrect, unfair and irresponsible to say that everybody knew. ""But as a result of the investigation, what we have learnt is how better to call out this behaviour in future."" He said the findings would help ""our industry as a whole, as together we rapidly evolve an intelligent new standard of protection and support in and around the workplace"". The theatre's executive director Kate Varah added that they did not want to ""just rush out a statement"", saying: ""We have not slept since this came out because we have been doing it in a robust, careful way."" Mexican actor Roberto Cavazos, who acted in several plays at the theatre, had previouslysaid Spacey ""routinely preyed"" on young male actors. The theatre said it could not comment on this due to confidentiality. The Old Vic set up a confidential complaints process on 31 October for people involved with the theatre. On 3 Novemberpolice in the UK confirmed they were investigating an alleged assaulton a man from 2008. Then, on 8 November, ex-television news anchorHeather Unruh told a press conference in Boston that her son had been sexually assaulted by Mr Spacey, at the age of 18 in a bar in Nantucket, Massachusetts, in July 2016. She said a criminal investigation was under way. Spacey has been replaced by Christopher Plummer in the film All the Money in the World Spacey's career has been hugely damaged by the allegations, with US network Netflixending further production of House of Cardsand the International Academy of Television Arts and Sciencesannouncing it will no longer give the actor a special Emmy award. His agent and publicist have dropped him as a client. He was alsoremoved from upcoming film, All the Money in the World, which had already been shot. He will be replaced by Christopher Plummer in the role of late oil tycoon John Paul Getty. Spacey said on 2 November he was seeking treatment, in the wake of the allegations. A representative for the actor said he was ""taking the time necessary to seek evaluation and treatment"". They did not give any information about what kind of treatment he wanted.

"This video can not be played Franken accuser: I was disgusted President Donald Trump has criticised Senator Al Franken on Twitter after the Democrat apologised for a photo of him appearing to grope a woman. Mr Trump called him ""Al Frankenstien"" - a misspelled reference to the undead monster - and mocked his previous advocacy for women's' rights. Mr Franken apologised to his accuser, but disputed ""forcibly"" kissing her. Mr Trump has yet to publicly comment on sexual misconduct allegations against Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore. Franken said the photo ""was clearly intended to be funny but wasn't"" ""The Al Frankenstien picture is really bad, speaks a thousand words,"" Mr Trump wrote in a pair of tweets late on Thursday. Los Angeles radio host Leeann Tweeden claims the now-Minnesota senator ""aggressively"" kissed her while they rehearsed a scene during a 2006 tour to entertain US troops in the Middle East and Afghanistan. He also had a photo taken of him appearing to touch her breasts while she slept onboard a military plane, she said. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""And to think that just last week he was lecturing anyone who would listen about sexual harassment and respect for women"", Mr Trump said in a follow-up tweet. Mr Trump has yet to comment on a string of sexual misconduct allegations against Republican US Senate candidate Roy Moore. The former Alabama Supreme Court judge denies has repeatedly denied the allegations and has resisted calls from his own national party to quit the US Senate race. WATCH: How Alabamans are defending the Roy Moore Hours before the tweets, White House President Secretary Sarah Sanders said the president found the allegations against Mr Moore ""very troubling"" and that ""the people of Alabama should make the decision on who their next senator should be"". Mr Trump has himself denied numerous allegations of sexual misconduct against him. During the second presidential debate, he was asked if he had ever grabbed anyone's genitals or kissed them without consent. ""Women have respect for me. And I will tell you: No, I have not,"" he replied. Later, when asked to explain the distinction between the allegations against Mr Trump and Mr Franken, Mrs Sanders said: ""Senator Franken has admitted wrongdoing, and the president hasn't. That's a very big distinction."" In an article for KABC,external, a Los Angeles radio station where Ms Tweeden now works, she recalled feeling victimised by Mr Franken during her ninth tour of the Middle East. ""You knew exactly what you were doing,"" she wrote. ""You forcibly kissed me without my consent, grabbed my breasts while I was sleeping and had someone take a photo of you doing it, knowing I would see it later, and be ashamed."" The former comedian issued an initial statement saying he did not recall the rehearsal, but sent his ""sincerest apologies to Leeann"". ""As to the photo, it was clearly intended to be funny but wasn't. I shouldn't have done it,"" he added. A Pentagon photo of the 2006 Hope & Freedom Tour in Kuwait show the two performing a skit Mr Franken later issued a second, longer statement following a backlash from critics who accused him of a non-apology and demanded his resignation. ""I respect women. I don't respect men who don't. The fact that my own actions have given people a good reason to doubt that makes me feel ashamed,"" he said. Allow Twitter content?

Of the photo, he added: ""I look at it now and I feel disgusted with myself... It's obvious how Leeann would feel violated by that picture."" US House requires anti-harassment training In Mr Trump's tweets on Thursday night, he also mentioned the ""Lesley Stahl tape"", whichrefers to a New York magazine story,externalabout a Saturday Night Live writers discussion in which Mr Franken suggested a joke about raping the CBS 60 Minutes correspondent. Mr Franken was quoted as saying: ""And, 'I give the pills to Lesley Stahl. Then, when Lesley's passed out, I take her to the closet and rape her.' Or, 'That's why you never see Lesley until February.' Or, 'When she passes out, I put her in various positions and take pictures of her.'"" Al Franken has been married to his wife, Franni (R), for more than 40 years and they have two adult children Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer called for the chamber's Ethics Committee to investigate Mr Franken, saying: ""Sexual harassment is never acceptable.""

Mrs Lofthouse joined the ATA in 1943 after spotting a notice in a magazine calling for women to learn to fly. She was one of only 164 female pilots, known as the Attagirls, who flew aircraft from factory to airfield. The Royal International Air Tattoo said she was an ""amazing character with even more amazing stories"". The ATA was formed in 1940 when, despite some male opposition, women were allowed to fly military trainer and communications aircraft.

Trained at Thame in Oxfordshire, she learnt to fly all types of single-seater aircraft but without a driving licence, she said she found ""taxiing much more difficult than flying"". ""We had nine days of technical training - it wasn't very technical - no navigation, just map reading,"" she said. ""After about 10 hours [of flying], they sent you off solo. My first solo flight I think you're only afraid if you're going to find the airfield again.""

"Mr Davis laughed off a question about the UK being prepared to pay 60bn euros for financial obligations David Davis has warned against ""putting politics above prosperity"" in Britain's post-Brexit relationship with the EU. In a speech in Berlin, the UK's Brexit Secretary outlined his hopes for a deal that ""allows for the freest possible trade in goods and services"". He also said he thought it ""incredibly unlikely"" there would be no deal. The EU says negotiations cannot move on to trade until questions about the UK ""divorce bill"", citizens' rights and Northern Ireland are resolved. All you need to know about Brexit Who does UK trade with on WTO rules? BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said Mr Davis's speech was delivered politely but implied ""pretty significant frustrations on the UK side with the EU's attitude"". In a question and answer session following the speech, a German interviewer got a round of applause for suggesting the UK government looked to be ""in chaos"". Mr Davis replied: ""One of the issues in modern politics is that all governments have periods of turbulence. ""This is a period of turbulence, it will pass."" In his speech to an economic conference organised by the German newspaper SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung, he said trade between Germany and the UK was worth 176bn euros a year or ""more than a thousand euros to every man, woman and child in each of our countries"". He said the ""close economic ties"" with the EU ""should continue, if not strengthen"" after Brexit, and he warned: ""Putting politics above prosperity is never a smart choice"". The UK was seeking a ""deep and comprehensive free trade agreement"" of a scope the EU had never seen before as well as ""continued close co-operation in highly regulated areas such as transport, energy and data"", he said. Britain would use an independent trade policy to lead a ""race to the top on quality and standards"" rather than engage in a ""race to the bottom"" that would mean lower standards, he told the audience. He said the EU and UK needed to ""think creatively"" about their post-Brexit relationship but stressed the need for a ""time limited transition period"" to implement the new arrangements. ""And that would mean access to the UK and European markets would continue on current terms. Keeping both the rights of a European Union member and the obligations of one, such as the role of the European Court of Justice. ""That also means staying in all the EU regulators and agencies during that limited period. Which would be about two years."" He added that tariff-free trade should be maintained and there must be an ""effective dispute mechanism"" for any disputes that may arise, that should be neither the UK courts, nor the European Court of Justice. ""It must be appropriate for both sides so that it can give business the confidence it needs that this partnership will endure."" In a question and answer session following his speech, Mr Davis laughed off a question about whether the UK would be prepared to pay 60bn euros to settle its financial obligations. He said the UK's aim was that ""nobody will have to pay more ... nobody will receive less"" but would not give a figure that the UK would be prepared to pay. Asked if he thought the Brexit negotiations would end in ""no deal"", he said: ""I think that's incredibly unlikely."" While the UK government has not put a figure on the amount it is prepared to pay to settle the UK's obligations but it has been estimated at 20bn euros (about Â£18bn). The Sun newspaper reported on Thursday that the prime minister was preparing to offer an additional Â£20bn to the EU to clear the way for talks about a transitional and future trade deal. Downing Street described that as ""yet more speculation"". EU sources told the BBC last week that the UK had only two weeks left to make progress on the so-called withdrawal issues, including the amount the UK will pay as it leaves and Mr Davis's EU counterpart Michel Barnier said ""time is pressing"" to get agreement on the bill.

"Former entertainer Rolf Harris has had one of 12 indecent assault convictions overturned by the Court of Appeal. Three judges in London ruled the conviction was ""unsafe"". But they dismissed applications by Harris, 87, to challenge the other 11 convictions. There will be no retrial on the one conviction quashed. The Australian-born TV presenter was jailed in 2014 for 12 indecent assaults, relating to four girls between 1968 and 1986. He was jailed for five years and nine months and has since been released from that sentence. The overturned conviction related to an allegation that Harris indecently assaulted an eight-year-old girl in 1969 at an event in Portsmouth. Though Harris was not in court for the ruling, he said in a statement: ""I have said all along that I did not attend and had never attended the location in Portsmouth as this complainant alleged at my first trial. ""I was not believed and she was... I have served a nine-month prison sentence based on her word."" He thanked his legal team, led by Stephen Vullo QC, for ""finally"" proving his innocence of the alleged crime, which he said was backed up by a ""fantasist"" claiming to be the sole witness. The man claimed to have been on leave from the military when he saw Harris in Portsmouth, but Mr Vullo's team proved he had never served in the armed forces - he was a lorry driver who had never left the UK. Harris claims this information was in the hands of the police ""from day one"" but was not given to his first legal team ""by mistake"". He added: ""I hope the press supply the facts to the public to let them decide if I am a monster or the subject of a frenzied witch hunt which focused more on grabbing headlines than finding the truth."" Announcing their decision on Thursday, Lord Justice Treacy, Mrs Justice McGowan and the Recorder of Preston, Judge Mark Brown, refused to give Harris permission to appeal against the rest of the convictions. They ruled that ""stepping back and looking at the totality of the evidence"" on those remaining counts, ""we find nothing that causes us to doubt the safety of those convictions"".

The pharmacy was criticised in July after refusing to reduce the cost of emergency contraception - and later pledged to supply an inexpensive alternative in all of its branches. But aletter from over 130 Labour MPs,externalsays they are ""deeply concerned"" only 69 of its 2,500 stores stock a version. Boots says it is doing ""all it can"" to roll the service out nationally. The morning after pill can be taken in the days after unprotected sex to prevent pregnancy. Buying contraceptives online isn't safe Coil 'better than morning-after pill' 'You feel like you're being judged' The company faced outrage in July after telling the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS) - which had called on Boots to reduce the cost of emergency pill, Levonelle - that making it cheapercould incentivise inappropriate use. At the time, the progestogen-based drug was priced at Â£28.25, while the non-branded equivalent was Â£26.75. Following a backlash, Boots apologisedand said it was committed to finding a cheaper alternative, and announced the roll-out of a generic pill costing Â£15.99. It said it had been ""working hard with the manufacturer to increase supply"" in order to offer this alternative across every store in October. But the MPs - led by shadow public health minister Sharon Hodgson - said it was ""difficult to understand"" why competitors had offered a cheaper alternative but Boots had not. Ms Hodgson wrote: ""We are deeply concerned that Boots are either unable or unwilling to deliver on your pledge. ""Over the Christmas period many women struggle to access contraceptive services and their usual family planning method. ""Clearly, pharmacy access to emergency contraception is of an even greater importance in December and January. ""Whilst Boots say they have started the process of rolling out this product in the stores, the progress they have made so far can only be described as a drop in the ocean with a long way to go before it is accessible in each of their 2,500 stores across the country."" She also urged the pharmacy to reduce the cost of the generic pill currently in stock. But Boots says it is working with MPs to make emergency contraception free from pharmacies to all women in England to ""end the current postcode lottery"". A Boots spokeswoman said: ""It is currently available as a free NHS service in the majority of our stores, however we would like to see one nationally commissioned NHS service available for all women in England, as there is in Wales and Scotland. She said the company remained committed to rolling out the service nationally and giving women access to emergency contraception. ""Unfortunately the manufacturer has experienced a batch failure due to quality issues which means that the stock we were expecting is not now available, and we are now waiting for a new batch to be produced. ""We thank our customers for their continued patience and reassure them that we are doing all we can to roll this service out to all our stores as soon as possible."" BPAS said it was ""absolutely scandalous"" that Boots had failed to deliver on its pledge, and there was ""no excuse"" for the slow progress. ""If Boots cannot 'source' a new version of emergency contraception to sell at a lower price, then they should do the right thing and cut the price of the version they currently have in stock. ""Regardless of 'supply chain delays', affordable emergency contraception is entirely within their gift to give right now. ""Every day they refuse to do so, more women are being ripped off, or risking an unplanned pregnancy because they cannot afford Boots's inflated price tag."" In England, emergency contraceptives Levonelle and EllaOne are free from most sexual health clinics, most GP surgeries and most NHS walk-in centres or urgent care centres. But they are free only to women in certain age groups from pharmacies in some parts of the country. In Scotland and Wales, the emergency contraceptive pill is available free of charge on the NHS from pharmacies, GPs and sexual health clinics. In Northern Ireland, some pharmacies allow it to be bought on the NHS, and it is available free of charge from sexual health clinics and GPs.

"Srin Madipalli says struggling to cope with inappropriate accommodation was ""humiliating and embarrassing"" A London firm sparked by two disabled people's frustration at hotels' inaccurate information on accessibility has been bought by Airbnb. Accomable was founded by two friends with spinal muscular atrophy in 2015. Former corporate lawyer Srin Madipalli came up with the idea after he quit his job to travel the world and found it difficult to find appropriate hotels. ""You'd turn up to places and the shower was tiny or there was a step to get in. It's just really humiliating,"" he says. He persuaded childhood friend Martyn Sibley to join him, and together they created a website aimed at making it easier for disabled people to travel. Like Airbnb, home owners are able to rent out rooms or entire properties via the website which only shows places which have step-free access and detailed information on accessibility adaptations. Airbnb said,externalAccomable would now be wound down over the next few months, with the listings incorporated into its own website, It said that the firm's  founders and most of its seven-person staff would stay on and help Airbnb improve the accuracy of its accessibility listings. ""While we have rules that prohibit discrimination against people with disabilities and an Open Doors policy that helps ensure everyone can find a place to stay, it's clear that we can do more to effectively serve people with disabilities,"" Airbnb said. The rental website said it was already working on new ""accessibility needs"" checklists for hosts. Most of Accomable's staff will now move to work for Airbnb Airbnb didn't say how much it had paid for Accomable, but Mr Madipalli said the sale would enable it to finally meet customers' demands. He said up until now the website had not had enough cash or staff, meaning it could only fulfil about 5 to 10% of booking requests. ""We see the need every day, which is why we wanted to team up with a bigger player,"" Mr Madipalli said. And the other change, Mr Madipalli said was that he would now start using Airbnb himself. Up until now the lack of wheelchair-accessible rentals had stopped him. ""But I look forward to trying it out,"" he says.

"As the world waits to see what happens next after Robert Mugabe refused to resign despite pressure from the army and the ruling Zanu-PF party, we look at some of the key things you should know about the country and its current situation. Zimbabwe has gone from one economic crisis to another over the last decade. Estimates of the country's unemployment levels vary, butthe country's biggest trade union claims the jobless rate was as high as 90% earlier this year,external. Zimbabwe has struggled with hyperinflation, which peaked in 2008 with an official rate of 231 million per cent. The country wasforced to abandon its own currency at a rate of Z$35 quadrillion to US$1, adopting the use of foreign cash. Because of a continuing chronic shortage of hard money, the government issued their own version of dollars called bond notes, but they have rapidly lost their value. People with money stored electronically in banks are unable to access it, or are subject to strict limits on what they can withdraw. Because of this, crypto-currencies that are traded online have risen in popularity. Following the news of the military takeover, Bitcoin prices in Harare surged on Wednesday. Zimbabwe crisis in 10 numbers The 93-year-old leader has confounded his critics by staying in power for so long. Sometimes dismissed as a cartoon figure abroad, he was viewed in Zimbabwe, at least originally, as a revolutionary hero who fought against white minority rule, and stillenjoys respect as the ""father of the nation"". But he and his supporters have used violence to keep a tight grip on power, using the machinery of the state to bolster his party and himself. His party says it is fighting capitalism and colonialism, but the country's economic problems have tested even his most ardent supporters. He has often said he would only step down when his ""revolution"" was complete, but also wants to handpick his successor - something that led to the current crisis. Robert Mugabe - Revolutionary hero or the man who wrecked Zimbabwe? Aged 93 and in visible decline, the battle to succeed him intensified in recent months. The ruling party split into two factions - one backing his wife Grace, 40 years his junior, and the other his long-time ally, Emmerson Mnangagwa. When he sacked Mr Mnangagwa, it was obvious that he was backing his wife to take power. She was deeply unpopular, partly because of her love of shopping, which led to her nickname ""Gucci Grace"". Mr Mnangagwa fought in the 1970s war of independence which brought Mr Mugabe to power and retains close ties with many other former comrades, who occupy senior positions across the top of all of Zimbabwe's security forces. So when he was ousted, they intervened on his behalf. Who is Grace Mugabe? If the ousted Mr Mnangagwa does succeed Mr Mugabe as president, he is cut from the same cloth. He has featured prominently in all of the atrocities and attacks on opposition supporters which have been carried out since Mr Mugabe came to power. However, he has hinted that he may introduce some economic reforms, and even work with the opposition in some form of transitional government. Emmerson Mnangagwa: The 'crocodile' who snapped back The military certainly intervened, however they have not replaced the president - yet. In a statement on television, the military said it had temporarily taken control to ""target criminals"" around the head of state, not Mr Mugabe himself, and still referred to him as ""commander-in-chief"". The army wants a veneer of constitutionality to be preserved, and certainly none of his former comrades wants to arrest him, or worse, as often happens to leaders when the military takes over. The army wants a political process to play out - Mr Mugabe to resign and Zanu-PF to name a new leader. And the military encouraged a public march to increase pressure on him, and show that their actions had the popular support. So far, however, he is refusing to play ball, even though the ruling Zanu-PF party has sacked him as its leader, and so parliament may have to impeach him. However, on Sunday, Mr Mugabe vowed to remain as president until the Zanu-PF congress, due in December, so it is far from clear what happens next.

"A man sells watermelon in the capital a day after the military moved against Mr Mugabe Driving around Zimbabwe, one can hardly tell the country is in the middle of the biggest political crisis since independence. In one town, a man in his 20s invites me to his shop and tries to convince me to buy a silver necklace. ""It costs $20 [Â£15],"" he says. ""But for you I can make that $15."" He offers the discount rather half-heartedly. ""You see, people don't want to spend money on thing like these; the economy is really doing badly."" The once-promising African country has sunk into an economic abyss. The government was forced to abolish the country's currency in 2009 because of hyperinflation, and introduced more stable foreign currencies such as the US dollar. Annual inflation reached 231 million per cent in central bank figures reported in July 2008 - officials gave up reporting monthly statistics when it peaked at just under 80 billion per cent in mid-November 2008. On Wednesday this week, the government published the latest inflation rate showing a 2.24% year-on-year rise for the month of October. Some economists, however, say the new figures are a gross underestimate. It is no surprise then that many Zimbabweans almost instantly warmed to the military's move to take control of the country, and confine President Robert Mugabe to his official residence. ""The military has done a good thing,"" says one bookseller. ""They will ensure we get a transitional government."" He is firmly convinced that Mr Mugabe's 37-year rule is coming to an end. There has been a sudden change of tone in the country, and the sense is that many Zimbabweans have been yearning for change. Any change, it seems, would do. Five things you should know about Zimbabwe Zimbabwe latest: Key players Did Robert Mugabe go too far? At the market, traders hope this means their fortunes will change. Many of them passively watch shoppers walk past their shops, resigned to the idea that most people are struggling to make ends meet. So when a middle-aged tourist buys souvenirs, the rest of the traders suddenly swarm around her as they invite her to view their merchandise. She thanks them, but politely declines the invitation and walks away. Traders working in a troubled economy hope that change will improve their fortunes The traders believe their economic situation will improve once Mr Mugabe's rule ends. But there is still political uncertainty surrounding the succession. The once-vibrant opposition has begun to speak out, and the former Prime Minister, Morgan Tsvangirai, is now back in the country. He has demanded that President Mugabe steps down. What started as a split within the ruling Zanu-PF party could well develop into a broader crisis with politicians from across the divide angling to take over from Mr Mugabe. But the president still commands a lot of respect as an independence icon. The same respect does not seem to be extended to his wife, Grace, who was thought to be his preferred successor. Her openly extravagant lifestyle has been widely criticised. What is clear is that the events of this week have dented - if not ended - any chances she had of succeeding her husband. In the midst of political uncertainty, Zimbabweans remain hopeful. Change is coming, in whatever form. Mugabe in crunch talks over his future What is going on in Zimbabwe?

"On social media there are several accounts claiming to be the mouthpiece of Zimbabwe's governing Zanu-PF party, but it's unclear which, if any, are official, and what links they have with those currently in charge. News networks across the world have been reporting on theseizure of power by military generals in Zimbabwe. Many media outlets, including the BBC, reported posts by the unverified Twitter account @zanu_pf which claims to be ""the only official handle"" for the Zanu-PF party. Zimbabwe latest: What we know so far Live page: Latest updates on army takeover Mnangagwa: The 'crocodile' who snapped back But it's far from clear who is in control of the account and what their connection to the party is. The account was described as a fake by PRI in 2012,external, and has previously adopted a tone at odds with what might be expected from official accounts. Allow Twitter content?

Several journalists in Africa, or specialising on African issues, quickly derided the reporting on the Zanu PF account. Matina Stevis-Gridneff, Africa reporter at the Wall Street Journalreferred to it as a ""parody account,"",externalbut said she, too, had earlier mistakenly retweeted its content. Alastair Jamieson, from NBC News' London office,tweeted,externalhe was trying to establish whether the account was not to be trusted, but could not find the evidence. The confusion about who's running the account isn't limited to outside observers. At times Zanu-PF officials have publicly wondered who is running the account. In 2013 another account, reported to be that of a spokesman for the Zanu-PF party,tried to ""urgently"" establish contact,externalwith the person running the @zanu_pf handle. Allow Twitter content?

Unusually for a party account claiming to be official, it did not post at all during 2014 or the first half of 2017. The account became active again in August with a post stating that it, and not the other account - @zanu_pf - was the real deal. Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played 'It's enough. Him and his government need to go' Zimbabwean exiles have gathered outside the country's embassy in London to celebrate the arrest of Robert Mugabe. Many of them are members of theZimbabwe Human Rights Organisation,external,  a UK charity which has protested weekly against the abuses of the Harare government.

""I publicly spoke against the government and was threatened for years, the threats got worse and I was scared for my life so I left. ""I think this is a step forward in the right direction.

"President Mugabe's ties to the military date from the liberation struggle Zimbabwe's military says its actions do not amount to a takeover. It still refers to Robert Mugabe as the commander-in-chief of the country's defence forces. But practically speaking, Mr Mugabe is not in charge if his forces can step in to usurp his authority. This is not a coup d'Ã©tat in name, but it appears to be in action. The military takeover of the national broadcaster, the presence of troops on the streets and major access points, and even forced entry into the presidential palace are traits of a military takeover - at least as we have seen them in Africa. One thing that is lacking is that the constitution has not been suspended. The cementing of democracy across Africa has led to a general regional and continent-wide aversion to violent takeovers of government. Even in the past, coup-stagers often promised a quick handover to civilian government through elections or a negotiated transition. The military says it has not taken control of the country So far in Zimbabwe, the military is not showing any intention of assuming a governing role. However, it has someone it would prefer to do that. Emmerson Mnangagwa, the recently sacked vice-president, is held in high regard in Zimbabwean military circles. The polarising Grace Mugabe Mnangagwa - the 'crocodile' who snapped back How can you tell a coup is happening? He was involved in the struggle for independence, and in 1980 created the Zimbabwe National Army by fusing the Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (Zipra) and Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (Zanla) with the remnants of the former Rhodesian security forces. He was seen as the natural successor for the top office. President Mugabe sacked Mr Mnangagwa last week at the prompting of the First Lady Grace Mugabe, who has political aspirations and has publicly opposed the former vice president, but does not have support within a military where the liberation legacy is held in high esteem. Grace Mugabe is a divisive figure in Zimbabwe The top military officials were part of the liberation struggle, like their comrade and president Mr Mugabe, so they have supported his government over the years because he has served their interests. They did not act this way in 2014, when Mr Mugabe sacked his previous Vice President Joice Mujuru, a former independence fighter, in a similar power struggle. This time though, there is a sense the president might have gone too far. Gen Chiwenga said that the military would not allow the purging of leaders with a liberation background from the governing party Earlier this week, the commander of Zimbabwe's Defence Forces, General Constantino Chiwenga, warned the Zanu-PF governing party to stop the purge against independence war veterans. Following his dismissal and escape to South Africa, Mr Mnangagwa promised to return to regain control of the ruling party from the Mugabes. This suggested his confidence in the support he had from the military. Emmerson Mnangagwa is highly respected in army circles So the next step would be to negotiate his return ahead of the party congress in December, where he could be affirmed as the president's successor. At worst, the military will force Mr Mugabe to resign - but they will not want to humiliate him further because of the history they share. They will also extend the courtesy to Grace Mugabe, in spite of her recent actions. Prior suggestions that the armed forces were divided have not been revealed so far this week. The rise of an opposing faction would probably be bloody, and not something Zimbabweans would like to see, regardless of how tough life has been in recent years. The end of the Mugabe era would be a relief to many, but Mr Mnangagwa is not necessarily popular in all parts of the country. Under his tenure as security minister in the early 1980s, government forces crushed a rebellion in the Midlands and Matebeleland province, and allegedly killed thousands of civilians. There is still bitter resentment among people from the affected regions. Robert Mugabe 'under house arrest' Zimbabwe latest: Key players How can you tell a coup is happening?

We are ending our live coverage of the army's seizure of power in Zimbabwe. We'll be back if there is any dramatic development. In the meantime, get the latest news from ourour website. We leave you with this photo, which captures the contradiction of the military takeover in Zimbabwe: Mr Mugabe is in office, but not in power: Shingai NyokaBBC Africa, Harare Following guns and explosions on Tuesday night, many thought it was the end for Zimbabwe's long-time leader, Robert Mugabe. But the violence has been replaced by an almost surreal normal. Mr Mugabe  has not yet reached a deal with the military about his future, and does not seem to be losing any sleep over it. For the first time since his arrest, he appeared in public today, conferring degrees on university students in the capital, Harare. Robert Mugabe conferred degrees on more than 3,000 students Sources suggest that he wants to continue as a figurehead until the ruling Zanu-PF party's national congress next month. The catalyst of this crisis, his wife, Grace Mugabe, has not been seen in public. Many suggest that she is confined to their private residence in the capital. It's her ambition to take over as vice-president that set off these events. Mr Mugabe sacked Vice-President Emmerson  Mnangagwa last week and Zanu-PF expelled him, in what was seen as a move to ease his wife's path to power. With Mr Mnangagwa being a former defence minister and a veteran of the war for independence, the military intervened, saying it was targeting ""criminals"" around the president. Read: How to spot a coup Robert Mugabe was widely respected in Africa Where do world leaders go when they're cast out of power and need to find a safe haven fast? President Robert Mugabe famously declared that he would cling to power in Zimbabwe ""until God says 'Come'"". And at the age of 93, he might have expected that hour to arrive before a human intervention. Nonetheless, following the military takeover, the leader of 37 years' standing must now barter himself a future. Even now, the military is still negotiating with Mr Mugabe about his possible resignation, but when - or if - he goes, can he expect a villa in the sun like fallen strongmen of the past? Read full story Stanley KwendaBBC Africa, Kutama To get to President Robert Mugabe's rural home, you drive
along the Robert Mugabe Highway. It is probably one of the most well-maintained roads in
Zimbabwe. It is like driving on a carpet. Along the way you are greeted by a
plaque erected in his honour. Kutama Village is home to the 93-year-old. It is a small and
tightly connected village where everyone knows each other. You cannot  really tell if they have been rattled by the
current political crisis. As we arrived, there was an air of uncertainty. Mr Mugabe
is respected here. To many, he is a father and a friend. Speaking to me at his compound, a 65-year-old neighbour
told me: He's kind, he's a good man and he understands people's plight.""  The man goes to St Francis Xavier Roman Catholic Church with Mr Mugabe, a devout Christian, whenever he visits.   He never demands special treatment. He visits people to check on their welfare.""  Nevertheless, he supported the intervention by the army to remove Mr Mugabe from office, saying it is meant to correct a broken system:  If his term goes out then there's nothing wrong.""  When I approached other villagers, I attracted immediate suspicion. They were not keen to talk. But it seems to me that Mr Mugabe is seen as a hero in the village. It is easy to spot people wearing clothes emblazoned with his face. Police officers are patrolling the area around Mr Mugabe's home. You can't really peep inside the compound because of tight security. Students at the University of Zimbabwe in the capital Harare are hopeful that the country will emerge from its current political crisis stronger, and will be able to deal with its myriad economic and social problems, as BBC Focus on Africa radio heard from them: Kim ChakanetsaBBC World Service President Robert Mugabe, seen here with his wife Grace and daughter Bona, comes from the Shona ethnic group Great weight is placed on respecting your elders among the Shona, which are Zimbabwe's biggest ethnic group. It is one of the fundamental values. At a young age you are taught to greet, speak and interact with elders in a particular manner. For example, when arriving at someone's house, an exchange of greetings will be led by the younger party, who must enquire about the health of every adult present. For girls or women, this could involve kneeling and clapping, then asking each individual in turn about their health. Boys and men will do much the same, but crouching. Failing to do so is frowned upon, and taken as a sign of a poor upbringing or lack of respect. Within the household, grandparents wield considerable influence. This reverence for elders extends beyond your family. Any older woman or man is to be treated in the same way. All 10 provincial committees of Zimbabwe's ruling Zanu-PF party have resolved to remove President Robert Mugabe from office, a UK-based representative of the party has said. The decision is expected to be endorsed by the party's top leadership body, the central committee, which will then elect the man Mr Mugabe sacked as vice-president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, as the acting leader, Nick Mangwana said. Mr Mnangagwa will then be endorsed as the next president at Zanu-PF's national congress, next month, he added in a tweet:  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Schoolchildren formed this mosaic of Robert Mugabe at Independence Day celebrations in April President Robert Mugabe's first public appearance after the military takeover in Zimbabwe will have puzzled some. Here he was at a university graduation ceremony given the authority to hand students their degrees, almost as if nothing had happened. It tells us two things. Firstly, this was political theatre. The suggestion being that behind-the-scenes negotiations over his exit deal are cordial. But it was also more than spectacle. It showed that President Mugabe's opponents want to treat the elder statesman with dignity. As in much of Africa, respecting your elders is ingrained in Zimbabwe's culture. And 93-year-old Robert Mugabe, a liberation fighter who became the country's leader at independence in 1980, is seen as the father of the nation. Read full story Zimbabwe's  #ThisFlag protest movement leader Evan Mawarire has urged people to attend tomorrow's planned rally to demand President Robert Mugabe's resignation so that the southern African state could make a ""fresh start"".

First Lady Grace Mugabe wanted to be the next president A ""palace revolution"" has taken place in Zimbabwe, after a split in the ruling Zanu-PF party over who will succeed President Robert Mugabe, South African political analyst Anthoni van Nieuwkerk has said. Mr Mugabe sacked his deputy, Emmerson Mnangagwa, in what was seen as a move to anoint his wife, Grace, as his successor. Mr Mnangagwa, a former defence minister, vowed to fight back, leading to the current crisis. His allies were grouped in Zanu-PF faction known as Lacoste, while Mrs Mugabe's allies were G-40. Mr Van Nieuwkerk told AFP: It is a palace revolution where one section of the ruling Zanu-PF party is using elements of the military, but not all of the security services - the police for example - to bring change within the ruling party.  Grace Mugabe was trying to get rid of her opponents, who were using aspects of the military to get rid of her.  So it is a limited military intervention with political purposes. The coup is against G-40  The calculation that the military is making is 'let's treat him with dignity and respect as we search for the way forward'. That is why he made the appearance at the university.""  Stanley KwendaBBC Africa, Kutama Villager says that Robert Mugabe understands the plight of people  There is no military presence of in Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe's home village of Kutama, some 90km (55 miles) from the capital, Harare. Many here are aware of the political crisis unfolding but
are reluctant to talk about it. A villager, who did not want to be named, said that people are fond of the nonagenarian president. Mr Mugabe is a good man ""who understands people's plight and likes to mingle with people in the area when he visits"", he said. However, he would not mind if the president, in power since 1980, was forced out of office, the villager added. The military has ended 36 years of loyalty to President Mugabe US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has called for a ""a quick return to civilian rule"" in Zimbabwe, following the army takeover on Wednesday, Reuters news agency reports. He described the situation as ""a concern"", adding: Zimbabwe has an opportunity to set itself on a new path, one that must include democratic elections and respect for human rights.""  Mr Tillerson made the comments to African foreign ministers in Washington, Reuters reports. The US is seeking ""a new era"" in Zimbabwe, the State Department's top official for Africa has said, Reuters news agency reports. Donald Yamamoto added: It's a transition to a new era for Zimbabwe, that's really what we're hoping for.""  Mr Mugabe was a fierce critic of Western powers Regional mediators have been mediating between Mr Mugabe and the army to end the crisis. The army says it has not staged a coup, despite the fact that Mr Mugabe is in its custody. He was allowed to attend a university graduation ceremony earlier today. The army is deployed on the streets of Zimbabwe's capital, Harare China has called for the political crisis in  Zimbabwe to be legally resolved, Reuters news agency reports. Foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters: China calls on all sides in Zimbabwe to keep their eyes on the country's long-term and fundamental interests, and uphold dialogue and consultations to bridge differences, to promote a peaceful and appropriate resolution to the issue under a legal framework.""  China was a key ally of Mr Mugabe, who increasingly pursued a ""Look East"" policy after Western powers condemned his controversial land seizure programme and treatment of the opposition. China gave Mr Mugabe strong backing during the 1970s war for independence, and has invested heavily in the southern African state. Last week, Zimbabwe's army chief Gen Constantino Chiwenga was on an official visit to China when Mr Mugabe fired his deputy Emmerson Mnangagwa. Gen Chiwenga is allied with Mr Mnangagwa, and put Mr Mugabe under house arrest on Wednesday.  The military detained President Robert Mugabe on Wednesday Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe was not accompanied by the presidential guard when he attended a university graduation ceremony in the capital, Harare, opposition politician David Coltart has said. The MDC senator said he had been reliably informed that Mr Mugabe's convoy was made of only three a cars. By allowing him to attend the event, the army generals who put him under house arrest on Wednesday were signalling to the regional bloc, the Southern African Development Community (Sadc), that Mr Mugabe was fine - but at the same time they were ""keeping him in his place"", he said. Sadc is trying to mediate an end to the crisis. Ivory Coast's President Alassane Ouattara has added his voice to calls for President Robert Mugabe, 93, to resign, AFP news agency reports. He praised Mr Mugabe's role  in the fight against colonialism, saying he ""has been the object of respect and  even adulation from many Africans and young Africans"". However, the ""world has changed""  and  because of his age and the ""long  time he has spent in office, everyone is aware that it is time for him to hand  over his seat to a new generation"", Mr Ouattara added. President Robert Mugabe's wife, Grace, 52, harboured ambitions to succeed him Mr Khama has been a strong critic of Mr Mugabe Botswana's President Ian Khama has backed calls for Zimbabwean leader Robert Mugabe to step down, the Reuters news agency reports. He says that the military intervention was ""an opportunity to put Zimbabwe on a path to peace and prosperity"". He added: I don't think anyone should be president for that amount of time [37 years]. We are presidents, we are not monarchs. It's just common sense.""  Botswana is among regional countries working to find a solution to resolve the ongoing political crisis. Mr Khama is a long-standing critic of Mr Mugabe, and has previously called for him to step down. Read: Mugabe - hero or wrecker? Analysis Joseph WinterBBC News website Africa editor Zimbabwe's security chiefs have worked with Mr Mugabe since they fought together in the 1970s war of independence Although the army is obviously calling
the shots in Zimbabwe, in public they still refer to Robert Mugabe as ""his
excellency, the president"" and even ""commander-in-chief"". This is why he has been allowed to
attend the graduation ceremony. This is partly to keep up the pretence that
they have not staged a coup but they also have a genuine, deeply felt respect
for him going back more than 40 years. All of Zimbabwe's security chiefs have
worked with Mr Mugabe since they fought together in the 1970s war of
independence - and the bonds forged in that struggle are difficult to break. In many ways, Zimbabwe's military
remains the armed wing of Zanu-PF, as it was when they were all rebels fighting
white-minority rule in the then Rhodesia. Furthermore, in Zimbabwean culture, the
elderly are treated with respect and no-one wants to be seen to be treating a
93-year-old in an undignified manner, especially a man even opposition figures
refer to as the ""father of the nation"". Zimbabwe's only independent MP - Temba Mliswa - has shared a video message expressing his hope for change in the country. He calls on Zimbabweans who want ""change"" to attend a rally planned to take place tomorrow in the capital, Harare: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"The number of unlicensed vehicles on the road has tripled since the paper tax disc was abolished, government figures show. The data, published every two years, shows that the government potentially lost out on Â£107m from 755,000 unlicensed vehicles last year. The RAC said the decision to get rid of the paper tax disc three years ago has proved ""costly"". The measure was meant to have saved the Treasury Â£10m a year, the RAC said. Figures from the Department for Transport show that 1.8% of vehicles were unlicensed in 2017 compared with 0.6% on 2013. ""The principle of abolishing the tax disc to introduce greater efficiencies has, so far, evidently failed,"" said RAC public affairs manager Nicholas Lyes. ""It appears that having a visual reminder was an effective way to prompt drivers into renewing their car tax - arguably more drivers are now prepared to try their luck and see if they can get away with not paying any vehicle tax at all, or are simply forgetting to tax their vehicle when they are due to."" When the abolition of the paper tax disc was announced by then-Chancellor, George Osborne, the Treasury said it showed government was moving ""into the modern age"". Officials said the disc, introduced in 1921, was no longer needed with the DVLA and police relying on an electronic register. However, there is clear evidence that it has led to confusion, mistakes or open flouting of the rules by drivers. The RAC said a third of untaxed vehicles had changed hands since September 2016, indicating that many drivers were not aware that tax does not carry over when ownership changes. The DVLA also said that it was running a campaign warning the rising number of people still driving cars that had been declared as off the road to tax their vehicles. The seller receives a refund of any full months of remaining tax while the new owner must tax the vehicle immediately. Just over half had been unlicensed for two months or less, suggesting some of these drivers had forgotten about their renewal date, although reminders are sent before the expiry date by the DVLA. The highest levels of evasion were in the West Midlands (2.1% of vehicles) and the North West of England (2%). The East of England had the lowest rate at 0.8%, with all other areas ranging between 1.6% and 1.8%. These results are based on where vehicles were seen in traffic by enforcement officers or cameras, not where they are registered.

"Former entertainer Rolf Harris has had one of 12 indecent assault convictions overturned by the Court of Appeal. Three judges in London ruled the conviction was ""unsafe"". But they dismissed applications by Harris, 87, to challenge the other 11 convictions. There will be no retrial on the one conviction quashed. The Australian-born TV presenter was jailed in 2014 for 12 indecent assaults, relating to four girls between 1968 and 1986. He was jailed for five years and nine months and has since been released from that sentence. The overturned conviction related to an allegation that Harris indecently assaulted an eight-year-old girl in 1969 at an event in Portsmouth. Though Harris was not in court for the ruling, he said in a statement: ""I have said all along that I did not attend and had never attended the location in Portsmouth as this complainant alleged at my first trial. ""I was not believed and she was... I have served a nine-month prison sentence based on her word."" He thanked his legal team, led by Stephen Vullo QC, for ""finally"" proving his innocence of the alleged crime, which he said was backed up by a ""fantasist"" claiming to be the sole witness. The man claimed to have been on leave from the military when he saw Harris in Portsmouth, but Mr Vullo's team proved he had never served in the armed forces - he was a lorry driver who had never left the UK. Harris claims this information was in the hands of the police ""from day one"" but was not given to his first legal team ""by mistake"". He added: ""I hope the press supply the facts to the public to let them decide if I am a monster or the subject of a frenzied witch hunt which focused more on grabbing headlines than finding the truth."" Announcing their decision on Thursday, Lord Justice Treacy, Mrs Justice McGowan and the Recorder of Preston, Judge Mark Brown, refused to give Harris permission to appeal against the rest of the convictions. They ruled that ""stepping back and looking at the totality of the evidence"" on those remaining counts, ""we find nothing that causes us to doubt the safety of those convictions"".

"This video can not be played In a recent documentary Benedict Allen described his experiences of living in Papua New Guinea Missing UK explorer Benedict Allen has been seen ""alive and well"" near an airstrip in Papua New Guinea. The BBC's Frank Gardner said Mr Allen had asked to be rescued and efforts were under way to retrieve him, but he was ""not out of danger yet"". A search was mounted for the 57-year-old after his family said he had not taken planned flights home. Mr Allen was travelling on his own to try to find the reclusive Yaifo tribe, whom he first met 30 years ago. His agent, Jo Sarsby, said the co-ordinating director for New Tribe Mission in Papua New Guinea, Keith Copley, had confirmed in writing at 17:00 local time that Mr Allen was ""safe, well and healthy"", and at a remote airstrip 20 miles north-west of Porgera, Enga Province. ""Confirmation on exact location coordinates are now being confirmed in order to arrange evacuation as soon as possible,"" she said. She said it was understood the airstrip was not accessible by road, so it was hoped a helicopter would be sent on Friday. By BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner Benedict Allen was under no illusions about the dangers and difficulties he would face when he chose to march off alone into the jungles of Papua New Guinea, in search of the isolated Yaifo tribe. This is exactly the sort of challenge he thrives on. But as well as having to contend with almost impossibly steep and forested terrain, it seems his plans have been disrupted by an outbreak of tribal infighting which often happens in remote areas. Although foreigners are rarely the target of this violence outside the towns, there is always a risk of being associated with one tribe that is at war with another. Those now trying to organise a rescue say he chose not to take a satellite phone, made no evacuation plan and left no coordinates of where he intended to end his journey. They say his only way out is by helicopter or light aircraft. Mr Allen's older sister, Katie Pestille, had said it was ""out of character"" for him to miss his scheduled flight out of Papua New Guinea to Hong Kong. The explorer, from London, has previously crossed the Amazon Basin on foot and in a dug-out canoe, and participated in a six-week male initiation ceremony in which crocodile marks were carved onto his body. He has filmed a number of his adventures for BBC documentaries and written books on exploration. First solo adventure:To the Amazon at 22, during which he was shot at by two hitmen Tough time:An initiation into manhood in Papua New Guinea.

"(L-R): Sajid Ali, Zaheer Iqbal, and Riaz Makhmood were found guilty of a total of 15 counts of indecent assault Three men have been jailed following the first trial to come out of the National Crime Agency's inquiry into historical sex abuse in Rotherham. Sajid Ali, 38, Zaheer Iqbal, 40, and Riaz Makhmood, 39, were convicted of a total of 15 counts of indecent assault on a teenage girl. The men plied the girl with alcohol and encouraged her to perform sex acts. She told Sheffield Crown Court their actions had ruined her teenage years. More stories from across Yorkshire This trial is the first to come out of Operation Stovewood, the National Crime Agency's (NCA) investigation into child sexual exploitation and abuse in Rotherham between 1997 and 2013. Sentencing the three men, Judge David Dixon said: ""The offences involved the exploitation and abuse by all three of you together of what at the time was a young and vulnerable girl. ""She was groomed, coerced and intimidated, she was called abusive names and she was treated like a thing, a thing that you passed around among yourselves."" The girl, who cannot be named, said she was 12 years old at the time the abuse began in the mid 1990s. She told the court she had not been popular at school when she started spending time with Ali, Iqbal and Makhmood, who she knew as 'Sos, Booty and Raz', but they had made her feel ""wanted"". The trial took place at Sheffield Crown Court The girl said she believed Ali was her boyfriend but within weeks of meeting them they began to talk about sex.

Reading a victim impact statement, prosecutor Sophie Drake said the abuse had led the girl to suffer from eating disorders, anxiety and depression. Her statement said: ""I've tried everyday to put these things behind me and while I manage most of the time they still haunt me."" All three men had denied the offences, with Ali claiming not to know the girl at all, saying that it would not have happened in the close knit community in which they lived. Ali, of James Street, Masbrough, Rotherham, was convicted of seven counts of indecent assault and jailed for seven-and-a-half years. Iqbal, of St John's Avenue, Masbrough, was found guilty of five counts of indecent assault and given a seven-and-a-half year prison sentence.

"This video can not be played Det Supt Paul Kessell said the 49-year-old is believed to be known to Gaia Police investigating the disappearance of teenager Gaia Pope have arrested a 49-year-old man on suspicion of murder. Paul Elsey, confirmed as the suspect to the BBC by his father, is from the Swanage area of Dorset. Mr Elsey, the third person to be held in the inquiry, is believed to be known to 19-year-old Gaia, who went missing from the town on Tuesday, 7 November. A search is continuing in an area where items of women's clothing were found earlier, Dorset Police said. Mr Elsey lives at the same property as his mother Rosemary Dinch, 71, who along with her 19-year-old grandson, Nathan Elsey, were arrested on suspicion of murdering Ms Pope on Monday. The pair were released on Tuesday while inquiries continue. Gaia Pope was last seen in Swanage on 7 November Det Supt Paul Kessell said the clothing was found on land near the Dorset coast path and ""a number of vehicles"" had also been seized. The officer said it was not clear who the clothes belonged to but they were ""similar"" to those which Gaia was wearing. Forensic officers are working in the area where items of clothing were found He added Gaia's family had been informed of the developments and were being supported. She was last seen nine days ago by family friend Ms Dinch in Swanage. Since Gaia's disappearance, extensive searches have been carried out in and around the resort, involving police, coastguard teams and local volunteers. Asked why the latest suspect had been arrested on suspicion of murder, Mr Kessell said: ""As you would expect, we have been conducting this inquiry for two weeks and it is our responsibility to investigate every avenue of inquiry that's open to us. ""In doing that, we continue to investigate whether Gaia has come to harm through an act of crime or whether she is missing and we will continue to do so."" He appealed directly to the public to come forward if they have any information or have had any contact with Gaia since she went missing. Police cordoned off an area of land, north of the coast path after items of women's clothing were found Gaia, who has severe epilepsy, is thought to have gone missing without her medication. Earlier, her father Richard Sutherland told the BBC the support from the community in the search had been ""heart warming"". ""It's been beautiful, it keeps us going. To feel that strength of everyone helping us - every bit of help is gratefully received and she's worth every bit of it,"" he said.

"Robert Piggott school would like voluntary donations amounting to Â£190 per family per year A primary school in Prime Minister Theresa May's constituency has asked parents for a Â£1 daily donation to help pay for stationery and books. Robert Piggott CofE School in Wargrave, Berkshire, said the plea comes after ""national changes to school funding"". Labour said this showed ""Tory cuts"" were ""hitting schools badly"". Education minister Nick Gibb said the school is set to gain around Â£10K a year in extra cash from 2018 under the newNational Funding Formula. The school, which according to the most recent figures has 311 pupils, is in the Maidenhead constituency represented by Mrs May since 1997. Four in 10 parents 'asked to give to school funds' Is it OK to charge for nativity plays? Schools 'depending on parents' direct debits' Head teacher asks parents for Â£40 towards textbooks The letter to parents read: ""One of the elements of [the funding plan] was to ask parents and the community to consider making donations to help meet the predicted shortfall in funding. ""Therefore, like many other schools, we are now requesting voluntary contributions from parents."" ""We would like to suggest that parents donate Â£1 per school day for each child to help the schools through this funding crisis. This equates to Â£190 per year."" The school said it would help pay for glue, pens, pencils, exercise books, paper, tape and reading books. Parent Anita Smith said: ""I have had the letter and to be honest with you I was fuming when I received it. ""Not at Robert Piggott because they are an exceptional school, but I'm so angry at the Government that the school has had to resort to this. ""I've got two children at the school so that's around Â£400 a year, but my salary hasn't gone up to cover that."" Theresa May has represented Maidenhead since 1997 News of the letter comes days afterschool heads delivered a letter to Downing Streetwarning schools are increasingly having to make requests for voluntary donations. Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner told theDaily Mirror,external: ""The Government can spin all they like but the reality is that Tory cuts are hitting schools badly, even in the PM's own constituency."" Education SecretaryJustine Greening said an extra Â£1.3bnwill be found for England's schools from existing budgets, though some teacher unions said this would not be enough to plug funding gaps. Mr Gibb said: ""Every school will see an increase in funding through the formula from 2018, with Robert Piggott CofE Infant and Junior Schools set to gain around Â£10,000 a year in total.""

"President Mugabe has made his first public appearance He attended a university graduation ceremony Military still referring to him as ""commander-in-chief"" But he is under growing pressure to resign Huge rally planned to demand he steps down Two African leaders urge him to go China calls for ""legal solution"" to crisis US demands ""quick return to civilian rule"" Soldiers remain on the streets of the capital, Harare Some government ministers have been detained The whereabouts of Mr Mugabe's wife remain unclear Dickens Olewe and Farouk Chothia Zimbabwe's first lady, or ""Gucci Grace"" to some, was tipped to be the country's next president. We are ending our live coverage of the army's seizure of power in Zimbabwe. We'll be back if there is any dramatic development. In the meantime, get the latest news from ourour website. We leave you with this photo, which captures the contradiction of the military takeover in Zimbabwe: Mr Mugabe is in office, but not in power: Shingai NyokaBBC Africa, Harare Following guns and explosions on Tuesday night, many thought it was the end for Zimbabwe's long-time leader, Robert Mugabe. But the violence has been replaced by an almost surreal normal. Mr Mugabe  has not yet reached a deal with the military about his future, and does not seem to be losing any sleep over it. For the first time since his arrest, he appeared in public today, conferring degrees on university students in the capital, Harare. Robert Mugabe conferred degrees on more than 3,000 students Sources suggest that he wants to continue as a figurehead until the ruling Zanu-PF party's national congress next month. The catalyst of this crisis, his wife, Grace Mugabe, has not been seen in public. Many suggest that she is confined to their private residence in the capital. It's her ambition to take over as vice-president that set off these events. Mr Mugabe sacked Vice-President Emmerson  Mnangagwa last week and Zanu-PF expelled him, in what was seen as a move to ease his wife's path to power. With Mr Mnangagwa being a former defence minister and a veteran of the war for independence, the military intervened, saying it was targeting ""criminals"" around the president. Read: How to spot a coup Robert Mugabe was widely respected in Africa Where do world leaders go when they're cast out of power and need to find a safe haven fast? President Robert Mugabe famously declared that he would cling to power in Zimbabwe ""until God says 'Come'"". And at the age of 93, he might have expected that hour to arrive before a human intervention. Nonetheless, following the military takeover, the leader of 37 years' standing must now barter himself a future. Even now, the military is still negotiating with Mr Mugabe about his possible resignation, but when - or if - he goes, can he expect a villa in the sun like fallen strongmen of the past? Read full story Stanley KwendaBBC Africa, Kutama To get to President Robert Mugabe's rural home, you drive
along the Robert Mugabe Highway. It is probably one of the most well-maintained roads in
Zimbabwe. It is like driving on a carpet. Along the way you are greeted by a
plaque erected in his honour. Kutama Village is home to the 93-year-old. It is a small and
tightly connected village where everyone knows each other. You cannot  really tell if they have been rattled by the
current political crisis. As we arrived, there was an air of uncertainty. Mr Mugabe
is respected here. To many, he is a father and a friend. Speaking to me at his compound, a 65-year-old neighbour
told me: He's kind, he's a good man and he understands people's plight.""  The man goes to St Francis Xavier Roman Catholic Church with Mr Mugabe, a devout Christian, whenever he visits.   He never demands special treatment. He visits people to check on their welfare.""  Nevertheless, he supported the intervention by the army to remove Mr Mugabe from office, saying it is meant to correct a broken system:  If his term goes out then there's nothing wrong.""  When I approached other villagers, I attracted immediate suspicion. They were not keen to talk. But it seems to me that Mr Mugabe is seen as a hero in the village. It is easy to spot people wearing clothes emblazoned with his face. Police officers are patrolling the area around Mr Mugabe's home. You can't really peep inside the compound because of tight security. Students at the University of Zimbabwe in the capital Harare are hopeful that the country will emerge from its current political crisis stronger, and will be able to deal with its myriad economic and social problems, as BBC Focus on Africa radio heard from them: Kim ChakanetsaBBC World Service President Robert Mugabe, seen here with his wife Grace and daughter Bona, comes from the Shona ethnic group Great weight is placed on respecting your elders among the Shona, which are Zimbabwe's biggest ethnic group. It is one of the fundamental values. At a young age you are taught to greet, speak and interact with elders in a particular manner. For example, when arriving at someone's house, an exchange of greetings will be led by the younger party, who must enquire about the health of every adult present. For girls or women, this could involve kneeling and clapping, then asking each individual in turn about their health. Boys and men will do much the same, but crouching. Failing to do so is frowned upon, and taken as a sign of a poor upbringing or lack of respect. Within the household, grandparents wield considerable influence. This reverence for elders extends beyond your family. Any older woman or man is to be treated in the same way. All 10 provincial committees of Zimbabwe's ruling Zanu-PF party have resolved to remove President Robert Mugabe from office, a UK-based representative of the party has said. The decision is expected to be endorsed by the party's top leadership body, the central committee, which will then elect the man Mr Mugabe sacked as vice-president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, as the acting leader, Nick Mangwana said. Mr Mnangagwa will then be endorsed as the next president at Zanu-PF's national congress, next month, he added in a tweet:  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Schoolchildren formed this mosaic of Robert Mugabe at Independence Day celebrations in April President Robert Mugabe's first public appearance after the military takeover in Zimbabwe will have puzzled some. Here he was at a university graduation ceremony given the authority to hand students their degrees, almost as if nothing had happened. It tells us two things. Firstly, this was political theatre. The suggestion being that behind-the-scenes negotiations over his exit deal are cordial. But it was also more than spectacle. It showed that President Mugabe's opponents want to treat the elder statesman with dignity. As in much of Africa, respecting your elders is ingrained in Zimbabwe's culture. And 93-year-old Robert Mugabe, a liberation fighter who became the country's leader at independence in 1980, is seen as the father of the nation. Read full story Zimbabwe's  #ThisFlag protest movement leader Evan Mawarire has urged people to attend tomorrow's planned rally to demand President Robert Mugabe's resignation so that the southern African state could make a ""fresh start"". Mr Mawarire, a pastor, is currently holding a livestream on his Twitter account to encourage Zimbabweans to show up at the rally: Allow Twitter content?

First Lady Grace Mugabe wanted to be the next president A ""palace revolution"" has taken place in Zimbabwe, after a split in the ruling Zanu-PF party over who will succeed President Robert Mugabe, South African political analyst Anthoni van Nieuwkerk has said. Mr Mugabe sacked his deputy, Emmerson Mnangagwa, in what was seen as a move to anoint his wife, Grace, as his successor. Mr Mnangagwa, a former defence minister, vowed to fight back, leading to the current crisis. His allies were grouped in Zanu-PF faction known as Lacoste, while Mrs Mugabe's allies were G-40. Mr Van Nieuwkerk told AFP: It is a palace revolution where one section of the ruling Zanu-PF party is using elements of the military, but not all of the security services - the police for example - to bring change within the ruling party.  Grace Mugabe was trying to get rid of her opponents, who were using aspects of the military to get rid of her.  So it is a limited military intervention with political purposes. The coup is against G-40  The calculation that the military is making is 'let's treat him with dignity and respect as we search for the way forward'. That is why he made the appearance at the university.""  Stanley KwendaBBC Africa, Kutama Villager says that Robert Mugabe understands the plight of people  There is no military presence of in Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe's home village of Kutama, some 90km (55 miles) from the capital, Harare. Many here are aware of the political crisis unfolding but
are reluctant to talk about it. A villager, who did not want to be named, said that people are fond of the nonagenarian president. Mr Mugabe is a good man ""who understands people's plight and likes to mingle with people in the area when he visits"", he said. However, he would not mind if the president, in power since 1980, was forced out of office, the villager added. The military has ended 36 years of loyalty to President Mugabe US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has called for a ""a quick return to civilian rule"" in Zimbabwe, following the army takeover on Wednesday, Reuters news agency reports. He described the situation as ""a concern"", adding: Zimbabwe has an opportunity to set itself on a new path, one that must include democratic elections and respect for human rights.""  Mr Tillerson made the comments to African foreign ministers in Washington, Reuters reports. The US is seeking ""a new era"" in Zimbabwe, the State Department's top official for Africa has said, Reuters news agency reports. Donald Yamamoto added: It's a transition to a new era for Zimbabwe, that's really what we're hoping for.""  Mr Mugabe was a fierce critic of Western powers Regional mediators have been mediating between Mr Mugabe and the army to end the crisis. The army says it has not staged a coup, despite the fact that Mr Mugabe is in its custody. He was allowed to attend a university graduation ceremony earlier today. The army is deployed on the streets of Zimbabwe's capital, Harare China has called for the political crisis in  Zimbabwe to be legally resolved, Reuters news agency reports. Foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters: China calls on all sides in Zimbabwe to keep their eyes on the country's long-term and fundamental interests, and uphold dialogue and consultations to bridge differences, to promote a peaceful and appropriate resolution to the issue under a legal framework.""  China was a key ally of Mr Mugabe, who increasingly pursued a ""Look East"" policy after Western powers condemned his controversial land seizure programme and treatment of the opposition. China gave Mr Mugabe strong backing during the 1970s war for independence, and has invested heavily in the southern African state. Last week, Zimbabwe's army chief Gen Constantino Chiwenga was on an official visit to China when Mr Mugabe fired his deputy Emmerson Mnangagwa. Gen Chiwenga is allied with Mr Mnangagwa, and put Mr Mugabe under house arrest on Wednesday.  The military detained President Robert Mugabe on Wednesday Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe was not accompanied by the presidential guard when he attended a university graduation ceremony in the capital, Harare, opposition politician David Coltart has said. The MDC senator said he had been reliably informed that Mr Mugabe's convoy was made of only three a cars. By allowing him to attend the event, the army generals who put him under house arrest on Wednesday were signalling to the regional bloc, the Southern African Development Community (Sadc), that Mr Mugabe was fine - but at the same time they were ""keeping him in his place"", he said. Sadc is trying to mediate an end to the crisis. Ivory Coast's President Alassane Ouattara has added his voice to calls for President Robert Mugabe, 93, to resign, AFP news agency reports. He praised Mr Mugabe's role  in the fight against colonialism, saying he ""has been the object of respect and  even adulation from many Africans and young Africans"". However, the ""world has changed""  and  because of his age and the ""long  time he has spent in office, everyone is aware that it is time for him to hand  over his seat to a new generation"", Mr Ouattara added. President Robert Mugabe's wife, Grace, 52, harboured ambitions to succeed him Mr Khama has been a strong critic of Mr Mugabe Botswana's President Ian Khama has backed calls for Zimbabwean leader Robert Mugabe to step down, the Reuters news agency reports. He says that the military intervention was ""an opportunity to put Zimbabwe on a path to peace and prosperity"". He added: I don't think anyone should be president for that amount of time [37 years]. We are presidents, we are not monarchs. It's just common sense.""  Botswana is among regional countries working to find a solution to resolve the ongoing political crisis. Mr Khama is a long-standing critic of Mr Mugabe, and has previously called for him to step down. Read: Mugabe - hero or wrecker? Analysis Joseph WinterBBC News website Africa editor Zimbabwe's security chiefs have worked with Mr Mugabe since they fought together in the 1970s war of independence Although the army is obviously calling
the shots in Zimbabwe, in public they still refer to Robert Mugabe as ""his
excellency, the president"" and even ""commander-in-chief"". This is why he has been allowed to
attend the graduation ceremony. This is partly to keep up the pretence that
they have not staged a coup but they also have a genuine, deeply felt respect
for him going back more than 40 years. All of Zimbabwe's security chiefs have
worked with Mr Mugabe since they fought together in the 1970s war of
independence - and the bonds forged in that struggle are difficult to break. In many ways, Zimbabwe's military
remains the armed wing of Zanu-PF, as it was when they were all rebels fighting
white-minority rule in the then Rhodesia. Furthermore, in Zimbabwean culture, the
elderly are treated with respect and no-one wants to be seen to be treating a
93-year-old in an undignified manner, especially a man even opposition figures
refer to as the ""father of the nation"". Zimbabwe's only independent MP - Temba Mliswa - has shared a video message expressing his hope for change in the country. He calls on Zimbabweans who want ""change"" to attend a rally planned to take place tomorrow in the capital, Harare: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Former entertainer Rolf Harris has had one of 12 indecent assault convictions overturned by the Court of Appeal. Three judges in London ruled the conviction was ""unsafe"". But they dismissed applications by Harris, 87, to challenge the other 11 convictions. There will be no retrial on the one conviction quashed. The Australian-born TV presenter was jailed in 2014 for 12 indecent assaults, relating to four girls between 1968 and 1986. He was jailed for five years and nine months and has since been released from that sentence. The overturned conviction related to an allegation that Harris indecently assaulted an eight-year-old girl in 1969 at an event in Portsmouth. Though Harris was not in court for the ruling, he said in a statement: ""I have said all along that I did not attend and had never attended the location in Portsmouth as this complainant alleged at my first trial. ""I was not believed and she was... I have served a nine-month prison sentence based on her word."" He thanked his legal team, led by Stephen Vullo QC, for ""finally"" proving his innocence of the alleged crime, which he said was backed up by a ""fantasist"" claiming to be the sole witness. The man claimed to have been on leave from the military when he saw Harris in Portsmouth, but Mr Vullo's team proved he had never served in the armed forces - he was a lorry driver who had never left the UK. Harris claims this information was in the hands of the police ""from day one"" but was not given to his first legal team ""by mistake"". He added: ""I hope the press supply the facts to the public to let them decide if I am a monster or the subject of a frenzied witch hunt which focused more on grabbing headlines than finding the truth."" Announcing their decision on Thursday, Lord Justice Treacy, Mrs Justice McGowan and the Recorder of Preston, Judge Mark Brown, refused to give Harris permission to appeal against the rest of the convictions. They ruled that ""stepping back and looking at the totality of the evidence"" on those remaining counts, ""we find nothing that causes us to doubt the safety of those convictions"".

"Richard Spencer and Tommy Robinson have lost their blue badges Twitter has stripped several far-right accounts of their ""verified"" badge, after changing its policy. Among them are Jason Kessler who helped organise a far-right march in Charlottesville, and white supremacist Richard Spencer. English Defence League founder Tommy Robinson also had his badge removed. Twitter said the badge was being interpreted as an ""endorsement or an indicator of importance"" and said it would change the scheme. The blue badge was first introduced to indicate the authenticity of prominent profiles on the social network. Originally the site had chosen who to verify, and usually reserved the status for celebrities, public officials and journalists. In July 2016, it opened the scheme up to the wider public and let anybody apply for a verified badge. Last week, the social network was criticised for giving Mr Kessler a verified badge, and on 9 November halted its verified profile scheme. It said it had not intended the blue badge to be an endorsement of views shared. ""We gave verified accounts visual prominence on the service which deepened this perception,"" it said. ""We should have addressed this earlier but did not prioritise the work as we should have."" Twitter said it was designing a new ""authentication and verification programme"", but in the meantime would ""remove verification from accounts whose behaviour does not fall within the new guidelines"". The new guidelines say verified status can be lost if a person breaks Twitter's rules or ""promotes hate"" on the basis of ""race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or disease"". It said behaviour both on and off Twitter would be taken into account. Some of those who had their verified badges removed said the new policy was being applied inconsistently and highlighted accounts of disgraced celebrities that had not lost the icon. Mr Kessler suggested Twitter had changed its rules to ""censor"" his views, while Mr Robinson said Twitter now classed the truth as ""hate speech"".

"Tony Blair pulled out of talks to fund Robert Mugabe's controversial land reforms in 1997 Britain's relationship with Zimbabwe has always been complex. A former imperial power can feel torn between a responsibility towards its ex-colony and a reluctance to interfere in what is now an independent state. And a freshly minted nation can feel resentment towards its former ruler while also hoping to maintain longstanding trade and cultural links. Thus it has been for London and Harare. Take, for example, President Mugabe. For years, he has railed against Britain and its political leaders as they opposed his disastrous land reforms, his persecution of white farmers and his calamitous management of Zimbabwe's economy. But Mr Mugabe is also an Anglophile who loves cricket, the Royal Family and Savile Row suits. He developed a surprising friendship with Lord Soames, the last British governor of what was then Rhodesia, whose son, Nicholas, the Conservative MP, he saw only a few weeks ago. And when Mr Mugabe's cabinet colleagues were celebrating the fall of Margaret Thatcher in 1990, he rebuked them, reportedly saying: ""Who organised our independence? Let me tell you - if it hadn't been for Mrs Thatcher none of you would be here today. I'm sorry she's gone."" Zimbabwe began life as a colony of the British South African Company in the late 19th Century, run by the British empire-builder, Cecil Rhodes. The moment Zimbabwean MPs hear Mugabe has resigned - BBC News In the 1920s, Southern Rhodesia, as it was then known, was annexed by the United Kingdom but with an element of self-government. The white minority ruled for decades, but were increasingly challenged by nationalist campaigners. Eventually, in 1965, the government led by Ian Smith unilaterally declared independence from Britain. UDI, as it was known, prompted international outrage and sanctions. Years of guerrilla warfare in the bush led to pressure for a negotiated settlement in Rhodesia, and, in 1979, Britain hosted all-party talks at Lancaster House in London. And from this process emerged a peace agreement, a new constitution and a former guerrilla fighter and leader called Robert Mugabe - the first prime minister of a newly independent Zimbabwe. Robert Mugabe has said he trusted Margaret Thatcher - in contrast to Tony Blair Even then, Britain's relations with Mr Mugabe were ambiguous. Politicians and diplomats at the time placed a huge amount of faith in him as exactly the kind of strong, pro-western leader that Zimbabwe would need to embed its new-found independence and democracy. But he nevertheless was still able to wind them up. Robert Mugabe: Hero or villain? Lord Carrington, Britain's foreign secretary who chaired the Lancaster House talks, described him as ""devious and clever, he was the archetypal cold fish"". On a dull moment in the talks, Lord Carrington rejoiced with glee when he discovered that Mugabe reads backwards as ""E ba gum"". Lord Hurd, another British foreign secretary, told The Africa Report that: ""Mugabe was one of those people the British Empire created who specialised in knowing how to twist the British government's tail. He was well-trained in the art of annoying the British if he needed to. He knew our ways."" At first, Britain was hopeful about Zimbabwe's prospects. And normal relations were maintained. The Princess of Wales visited Mr Mugabe in Harare in 1993. The England cricket team, led by Michael Atherton, played Zimbabwe in Harare in 1996. But over the decades of Mr Mugabe's rule, as the country slipped into greater autocracy and economic decline, relations deteriorated. Campaigner Peter Tatchell protested regularly in London against Robert Mugabe In 1997, Tony Blair's government pulled out of talks to fund Mr Mugabe's controversial land reforms. The Zimbabwean president accused the British of meddling in his country's affairs by funding his political opponents. Britain began to withdraw development aid and sanctions were imposed on the president and his inner circle.

"Josh Rivers became Gay Times Editor last month Josh Rivers, sacked from his new role as editor at the Gay Times over offensive tweets published in the past, has said he is ""appalled"" by his posts. The tweets, some of which have now been deleted, have been described as racist, transphobic, homophobic and anti-Semitic. Mr Rivers, whohas already apologised,external, also made remarks about obese people and children with disabilities. He told Radio 4's PM programme: ""I was appalled... I said, 'Who wrote that?'"" ""I was stunned, I was confused. I spent most of my 20s in a daze, in a blur. I was not sober as much as I probably could have been. The 31-year-old added: ""I was lost, I was angry. I was upset, I was lonely. And I think those tweets are a reflection of someone lashing out at the world around him. ""They were cries for help."" Mr Rivers said: ""My past is mine to reckon with... I have to look in the mirror (every day), I have to get myself to a place where I'm fit to serve the community."" He said he had ""no recollection"" of writing the tweets, saying he had drunk heavily in his 20s. Mr Rivers added that he had been seeing a therapist since 2014 ""to unpick the loneliness and sense of abandonment... I've taken who I was and I've turned it into who I want to be"". The Gay Times magazinewrote on Twitter,externalthat it had removed all articles written by Mr Rivers from its website. Gay Times said: ""Gay Times do not tolerate such views and will continue to strive to promote inclusivity. ""We sincerely apologise for the offence that has been caused, particularly to those members of our wider community to whom such inappropriate and unacceptable commentary was the focus."" The publication added it is relaunching on 30 November with ""what is quite possibly the most significant overhaul in its 33-year history"". It will feature submissions and significant contributions from ""the far reaches of our wonderful and diverse LGBTQ community"".

The Old Vic's announcement follows recent allegations of sexual harassment and predatory behaviour made against the double Oscar winner and former House of Cards actor while at the theatre. Spacey has not responded to them. Kevin Spacey timeline: How the story unfolded The actor's behaviour was alleged to have ranged from making people feel uncomfortable to sexually inappropriate behaviour, the Old Vic investigation found. No-one alleged rape but three people told the Old Vic they had contacted the police, while 14 of the 20 complainants were told by the investigators that they should consider going to the police. There were 20 individual allegations and 16 were former staff, all of whom were men. Lewis Silkin, the external law firm engaged by the theatre to conduct the investigation, said more than half the allegations were said to have taken place inside the Old Vic. The investigation also found there was not widespread knowledge of Spacey's alleged behaviour within the organisation, the law firm said.

"This video can not be played The painting has been cleaned and restored from the image on the left to the one on the right A 500-year-old painting of Christ believed to have been painted by Leonardo da Vinci has been sold in New York for a record $450m (Â£341m). The painting is known as Salvator Mundi (Saviour of the World). It is the highest auction price for any work of art and brought cheers and applause at the packed Christie's auction room. Leonardo da Vinci died in 1519 and there are fewer than 20 of his paintings in existence. Read aboutLeonardo da Vinci (1452 -1519) 'Mona Lisa nude sketch' found in France Can buying paintings make you rich? Salvator Mundi, believed to have been painted sometime after 1505, is the only work thought to be in private hands. Bidding began at $100m and the final bid for the work was $400m, with fees bringing the full price up to $450.3m. The unidentified buyer was involved in a bidding contest, via telephone, that lasted nearly 20 minutes. Excitement in the auction room rose as the bids by telephone came in The painting shows Christ with one hand raised, the other holding a glass sphere. In 1958 it was sold at auction in London for a mere Â£45. By then the painting was generally reckoned to be the work of a follower of Leonardo and not the work of Leonardo himself. It apparently was part of King Charles I of England's collection in the 1600s and got lost, but was ""rediscovered"" in 2005. Analysis by Arts Editor Will Gompetz $450m for Salvator Mundi is an astonishing price to have realised, given both its condition and authenticity have been questioned. It shows that ultimately art comes down to belief. And there were plenty of bidders last night who were suitably convinced by its Leonardo da Vinci attribution to drive the price up to such stratospheric heights. As yet, the new owner is unknown. Speculation will be rife. Which I will contribute to, by noting the newly opened Louvre Abu Dhabi will have a Leonardo shaped hole in its displays when the decade-long loan deal with the French museums comes to an end. Wherever it ends up, you've got to hand it to Christie's for its masterclass in the art of selling art. Art agents celebrated when the sale was completed In a bold move, without a hint of irony, the painting was sold in its Post-War and Contemporary Art Evening Sale alongside a Jean-Michel Basquiat and Andy Warhol. Why not in the Old Masters Sale? Because that's not where the elephant bucks are. The big money comes into the room nowadays when Pollocks and Twomblys are on the block, and promptly leaves when the Reynolds and Winterhalters arrive. Read more of Will Gompertz's blogs here. This video can not be played Salvator Mundi was discovered hidden under layers of paint Dr Tim Hunter, who is an expert in Old Master and 19th Century art, told the BBC the painting is ""the most important discovery in the 21st Century"". ""It completely smashes the record for the last Old Masters painting to sell - Van Gogh's Sunflowers in 1988. Records get broken from time to time but not in this way. ""Da Vinci painted less than 20 oil paintings and many are unfinished so it's incredibly rare and we love that in art."" Before the auction it was owned by Russian billionaire collector Dmitry E Rybolovlev, who is reported to have bought it in a private sale in May 2013 for $127.5m (Â£98m). The painting has had major cosmetic surgery - its walnut panel base has been described as ""worm-tunnelled"" and at some point it seems to have been split in half - and efforts to restore it resulted in abrasions. BBC arts correspondent Vincent Dowd said that even now attribution to Leonardo is not universally accepted. One critic has described the surface of the painting to be ""inert, varnished, lurid, scrubbed over and repainted so many times that it looks simultaneously new and old"". ""Any private collector who gets suckered into buying this picture and places it in their apartment or storage, it serves them right,"" Jerry Saltz wrote on Vulture.com. But Christie's has insisted the painting is authentic and billed it as ""the greatest artistic rediscovery of the 20th Century"". Georgina Adam, who is an Art Market specialist, told the BBC the price of the piece is ""fuelled by the sheer amount of money that billionaires have."" ""This is the last Leonardo painting you can buy. This isn't as a store of value, it's the ultimate trophy - only one person in the world can own this. ""If you think of the wealth of some billionaires, Bill Gates is worth 87 billion, and I'm not saying it's him, but near to half a billion would not be a colossal chunk out of his income for example."" The auction house has not revealed who purchased the picture, but Hunter speculates it could be a buyer from Asia or even be on the way to the newLouvre in Abu Dhabi. Could the painting be headed for Abu Dhabi's new Louvre Museum? ""It's the sort of painting you can imagine as a star piece in a private collection and as billionaire collectors like to set up their own museums, it could be a good piece for them,"" Hunter said. Adam also thinks the piece could have gone to an Asian market. ""We don't know who bought it, I went to the Louvre in Abu Dhabi and I did wonder whether the Gulf could be responsible. ""People are thinking the Far East, the picture was taken to Hong Kong before it was put up for sale to show to possible buyers there so that is possible.

"Eighteen of the 20 Premier League clubs offer specific discounts for teenagers and young adults The BBC Price of Football study has found the majority of ticket prices have been frozen or have fallen for a third year - yet a poll of young adult football fans suggests the cost is still putting them off. This year BBC Sport asked more than 200 clubs across the United Kingdom for information on ticket prices and found almost two thirds of price categories have been reduced or remained the same across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. In a separate poll, we asked 1,000 18- to 24-year-old fans living in Britain how they engage with football, and four in five (82%) said the cost of tickets was an obstacle to them going to more matches. The annual study found 135 clubs out of 190 in England, Scotland and Wales offer reduced prices for teenagers and young adults - separate from any student concessions - but 55% of the fans we polled said they had stopped going completely or go to fewer games because it was too expensive. Young adult fans can save, on average, Â£146.94 on season tickets in the English Premier League and Football League, while in the top four divisions in Scotland the average saving on a season ticket is Â£143.66. How much could you pay? Enter your team in the calculator Analysis: What does it mean for clubs and fans? Premier League cuts or freezes majority of prices Take the Price of Football quiz According to figures from the Premier League, young adult fans bought 4% of all season tickets this year. A report in 2015 suggested the average age of an adult supporter in the Premier League was 41. Rob Wilson, football finance expert at Sheffield Hallam University, says top clubs need to do more to attract young adults. ""These fans are the next generation of season ticket holders but they have been brought up in a sanitised and expensive environment,"" he told BBC Sport. ""With this in mind, they are reluctant to pay so much to watch their teams play and these findings should act as a warning to the Premier League elite - they ignore this group of fans at their peril."" Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger admitted he was worried by the findings. ""I think nothing is better than to share the experience of a stadium,"" he said. ""There are many ingredients in the modern game that stopped people going. The lifestyle is different, they play less, they play more computers. ""The security of gathering people is a problem. Can you afford to go when you are young? There are many ingredients we have to take care of in the game."" This video can not be played Home ground v home comforts - how young fans watch football In a statement, the Premier League said: ""Clubs engage with their fans in many ways and hugely appreciate their loyal and passionate support. ""For young fans specifically, all clubs offer concession prices, including discounted junior season tickets."" The online poll, conducted by ComRes, also showed young fans are more likely to engage with football by playing games on a console or PC (61%) than in a football team (37%). More young football fans bet on the sport (44%) than play in a team (37%), but more fans play in a team than have a fantasy football team (33%). Only one in four fans (26%) said they go to watch football live more than once a month. Are young people being priced out of football? Watch our live debate,external Two thirds (65%) of young football fans said the cost of travel was an obstacle to attending more matches. Three quarters (74%) of young fans said they get their football news from social media - 24% from print newspapers. Three in five fans aged 18-24 go to a sport app or mobile site (59%) for football news while at least half access it via a TV results service (53%). 70% of supporters agreed football clubs did value their fans, but more than half of the teenagers and young adults (56%) said professional football was not run with them in mind. Similar numbers of football fans asked said they go to a football match at least once a week (11%), two to three times a month (15%) or five to 10 times a season (14%). One in six (16%) male football fans aged 18-24 said they go to a match at least once a week, compared to 7% of women in this group. Of the top four leagues inEngland,92% of clubs offer special prices for young adults, separate from any student concessions. The age ranges vary from 16-24 years old, with most targeting the 18-21 bracket. The biggest discounts come in the Premier League, where an Arsenal member aged 16-19 can purchase a season ticket for Â£384 compared to the cheapest adult season ticket at Â£891 - a saving of Â£507. Chelsea offer the biggest discount on single matchday tickets for their under 20s, who can pay Â£15.50 instead of Â£47 - a saving of Â£31.50. But despite these discounts, 81% of the young adult football fans living in England who were polled say they feel the cost of tickets is stopping them from going to more matches. InScotland,27 of the 42 clubs offer young adult discounts. In the poll, 79% of fans say cost is an obstacle to them attending football matches. A third of the clubs in the Welsh Premier League offer special discounts for young adults. Of the young adults asked inWales,90% say the cost of tickets puts them off going to watch football. The Price of Football: Results in full Young adult ticket data in full How we produced the Price of Football 2017 Rob Wilson, football finance expert, Sheffield Hallam University: E-sports are becoming big business and this is the next key challenge for clubs. How do you convert e-sport players into terrace-goers? Can you link the e-game to the actual one? How can mobile technologies support this at half-time, for example? Moreover, the way young fans consume information is changing - clubs need to engage fans much more effectively when it comes to social media. We've seen big reductions in subscriptions to the pay TV platforms so it's unsurprising young people think twice about live football. There are also lots of options for young people to spend their leisure pound (the cinema, gym, university, cars etc) so football clubs need to work much harder to engage them. There is no magic bullet but they need to do more and communicate that more effectively. The long-term impact of young fans feeling priced out is yet to be truly felt. Kevin Rowles, economics expert: What we are seeing, especially with young people, is that incomes are being squeezed in real terms and this will lead to a decrease in demand, particularly as there are alternative leisure opportunities. The number of fans attending football will also respond to rise and fall in prices because of the price elasticity of demand for tickets. Support for a team is often a matter of loyalty and hence lower prices may not attract many new fans. If young people find their finances are stretched, they may make a rational choice to follow a team by other means such as screened matches. Young people tend to be in work but with the very slow growth in wages in the past 10 years, their income is lagging behind living costs. Real wages are not rising and young people are also saddled with student debt. Rent and utility bills have to be paid and they are rising faster than other prices. Then, when you have to pay for food on top, it means things like sport and paying to watch football are not a priority. Dr Rachel Andrew, clinical psychologist: There are a number of different, interacting factors that play a part in young people's decision making. These factors are relevant to decisions made about leisure (and in particular football). These include factors such as: 1) temperament and personality and 2) past history - including childhood memories, parents' interests & values, and past teachers or peer influence. However, there are some interesting trends around leisure also. Young people are drinking less. Young people are more thoughtful about what they want to do with their time and money. Superficially it looks like they have increased choice about what they may do, but in reality they also have less money and less time. As a young person gets older, it often becomes more important to make decisions that will not alienate them from a social group of friends when compared to decisions that their parents may not like or may be unhealthy. I am not surprised young people are engaging with football online through videos/fantasy football and probably through social media & apps too - as this is a trend we are seeing across the board with leisure. I feel sad and disappointed that young people are playing less football as there are so many physical and mental health benefits to this. It is sad that the big drive to increase football in schools is not having a long-term effect once children leave school. Do you attend football matches regularly? If so, what keeps you coming back?

"Josh Rivers became Gay Times Editor last month Josh Rivers, sacked from his new role as editor at the Gay Times over offensive tweets published in the past, has said he is ""appalled"" by his posts. The tweets, some of which have now been deleted, have been described as racist, transphobic, homophobic and anti-Semitic. Mr Rivers, whohas already apologised,external, also made remarks about obese people and children with disabilities. He told Radio 4's PM programme: ""I was appalled... I said, 'Who wrote that?'"" ""I was stunned, I was confused. I spent most of my 20s in a daze, in a blur. I was not sober as much as I probably could have been. The 31-year-old added: ""I was lost, I was angry. I was upset, I was lonely. And I think those tweets are a reflection of someone lashing out at the world around him. ""They were cries for help."" Mr Rivers said: ""My past is mine to reckon with... I have to look in the mirror (every day), I have to get myself to a place where I'm fit to serve the community."" He said he had ""no recollection"" of writing the tweets, saying he had drunk heavily in his 20s. Mr Rivers added that he had been seeing a therapist since 2014 ""to unpick the loneliness and sense of abandonment... I've taken who I was and I've turned it into who I want to be"". The Gay Times magazinewrote on Twitter,externalthat it had removed all articles written by Mr Rivers from its website. Gay Times said: ""Gay Times do not tolerate such views and will continue to strive to promote inclusivity. ""We sincerely apologise for the offence that has been caused, particularly to those members of our wider community to whom such inappropriate and unacceptable commentary was the focus."" The publication added it is relaunching on 30 November with ""what is quite possibly the most significant overhaul in its 33-year history"". It will feature submissions and significant contributions from ""the far reaches of our wonderful and diverse LGBTQ community"".

"Health authorities said there was no evidence of any broad contamination of game meat A New Zealand family are seriously ill in hospital, with a wild boar they hunted and ate being investigated by doctors as one possible cause. Friends of the family wrote in a Facebook post that Shibu Kochummen, his wife Subi Babu and mother Alekutty Daniel collapsed after eating the meat. Health officials said there is no evidence of any ""broader contaminated game"" or any risk to public health. Two children who did not eat the meat are unaffected. But the three adults in the family had cooked and eaten the boar, before being found on the floor of their home in Waikato by emergency services last Friday, friends of the family said. Joji Varghese told the BBC that doctors are waiting on a toxicology report and that ""the nature of the contaminant is unknown"". In a Facebook post appealing for help, Mr Varghese and other friends of the family wrote of the severity of their condition, adding that officials had sent samples of all food items found in the family's home for testing. The family moved to New Zealand from India five years ago and Mr Kochummen, a hunting enthusiast, had earlier shot the wild boar which they eventually ate. ""We are still investigating potential sources for the illness in this case,"" said Richard Vipond, a medical officer at the Waikato Health Board, in a press release. He added that those who hunt or handle game meat should follow theguidelines set out by the Ministry of Primary Industries,externalto reduce any risk of contamination. Mr Kochummen and Ms Daniel are reportedly stable in a ward, but Ms Babu remains in critical condition, according to Dr Vipond. The Indian High Commission told the New Zealand Herald that embassy staff are working with family and friends.

Among them are Jason Kessler who helped organise a far-right march in Charlottesville, and white supremacist Richard Spencer. English Defence League founder Tommy Robinson also had his badge removed.

"Social media was Felix's life, his mum Lucy Alexander says The Duke of Cambridge, inspired by a mother's story of loss, has launched a code of conduct to beat cyberbullying. Lucy Alexander's son, Felix, killed himself aged 17 after years of being bullied on social media. The prince, together with tech firms, children's charities and parents, wants young people to follow the equivalent of a Green Cross Code for the internet - to ""stop, speak, support"". Facebook and Snapchat are also set to trial giving access to counselling. Other firms, including Google and EE, have also taken part in the project. At the final meeting of the cyberbullying taskforce at Google's HQ in London, Prince William urged tech giants to ""innovate, collaborate and educate"" people on the dangers of cyberbullying. ""You've heard me say before that this is a personal issue for me,"" he told representatives from Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter and Vodafone. ""My work with the air ambulance saw a lot of suicide, some of it from bullying, some from other areas of life."" The aim of the new code of conduct is to encourage 11 to 16-year-olds across the UK to stop negative behaviour, tell a responsible adult and support victims of bullying. The Duke of Cambridge became interested in helping to tackle the issue shortly after his son Prince George was born, when he first heard about Felix Alexander. 'Ate away at him' In a moving video filmed to highlight the project, Lucy Alexander, from Worcester, told the prince about her son Felix. ""Social media was his life. It was the way everyone communicated, and if you weren't on it, you were isolated. ""If he was invited to a party, someone would text saying: 'You don't want to invite him. Everyone hates him'. ""And all he saw was negative. He saw himself as stupid and ugly,"" she told the prince. ""It just ate away at him inside, I think, but I had no idea of the depth of his despair at all."" How can I keep my kids safe online? Is your child a cyberbully? She believes the prince's initiative could have helped her son in his darkest times. ""It may not have changed my story, but it's got to be a step forward,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. It's bullying behaviour on social networks, games and mobile phones, which can include spreading rumours about someone, or posting mean or embarrassing messages, photos or video. The NSPCC says children may know who is behind the bullying, and it may be an extension of bullying in school or elsewhere. Or the bully may be targeting someone using a fake or anonymous account. Cyberbullying can happen at any time and anywhere, even when a child is alone in their bedroom, making it feel as if there is no escape. Prince William also heard from Chloe Hine, who, aged 13, tried to take her own life after enduring sustained online abuse. ""You can't escape it. You're constantly with that bully,"" she said. She described being part of a group who turned on her after she said something they didn't want to hear. They decided they should all hate her and would twist her words, she said. ""Then it kind of spiralled out of control from there."" The prince highlighted the danger of anonymous bullying - which he says can come directly into a young person's bedroom but remain invisible to those around them. Allow Twitter content?

""It is one thing when it happens in the playground and it's visible there and parents and teachers and other children can see it. ""Online, you're the only one who sees it, and it's so personal. It goes straight to your room."" he said. He also warned against cyber-bullies being able to ignore the real-world consequences of their actions. ""I think it is worth reminding everyone that the human tragedy of what we are talking about here isn't just about companies and online stuff - it's actually real lives that get affected,"" he added. Instagram tops cyber-bullying study How I felt when I ditched social media Cyber-bullying relatively rare, says study Speaking ahead of the meeting, taskforce chairman Brent Hoberman said William was instrumental in doing something that ""almost no-one can do"" by bringing together top representatives of rival companies. He said he wanted to see the trial to give young people access to a counsellor rolled out universally. Asked whether the onus should be on the tech firms to remove the bullying posts or messages, he told BBC's Today programme that removing them may not be as effective as helping the young person emotionally. The message, he said, to young people was ""don't be bystanders - step up speak out, stop this"". The responsibility to deal with this was ""everywhere"", he added. Talk about it - find the right time to approach them with your concerns. Show your support - stay calm, be considered and tell them how you will help them. Don't necessarily stop them going online - this can make them feel more isolated. Help them to deal with it - advise them to tell the person how it makes them feel and ask them to take any pictures or comments down. Don't retaliate - advise them against responding to abusive messages and to leave uncomfortable conversations. Block the bullies - if messages continue, block the sender and report them to the social network or gaming platform. Keep the evidence - take screenshots as proof. Don't deal with it alone - talk to friends or your child's school for support. Know when to take it further - consider telling the police if your child is in danger. Don't stop when the bullying stops - keep talking and consider counselling.

"Seventy one victims of the Grenfell Tower fire have been formally identified and police believe that all those who died have now been recovered. The number of victims includes baby Logan Gomes, who was stillborn in hospital on 14 June, the day the 24-storey blaze broke out. The final two victims to be formally identified have been named as Victoria King and daughter Alexandra Atala. The Met said it was providing ""every support we can"" to the bereaved. Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? Visual guide to the Grenfell Tower fire Inside the 21st floor of the Grenfell Tower fire Metropolitan Police Commander Stuart Cundy said: ""I have been clear from the start that a priority for us was recovering all those who died, and identifying and returning them to their families. ""Specialist teams working inside Grenfell Tower and the mortuary have pushed the boundaries of what was scientifically possible to identify people. ""After the fire was finally put out, I entered Grenfell Tower and was genuinely concerned that due to the intensity and duration of the fire, that we may not find, recover and then identify all those who died. Victoria King, pictured, died in the flat alongside her daughter Alexandra Atala ""I know that each and every member of the team has done absolutely all they can to make this possible."" In June, the Met had a list of 400 missing people - some of whom were reported a number of times under different names or spellings, with one person in particular recorded 46 separate times. The work to investigate and locate all those reported as missing was only concluded in the last few weeks, the Met said. The family of Ms King, 71, and Ms Atala, 40, said they were ""devastated"" to learn of the pair's fate, adding that the mother and daughter were ""devoted to each other"". The original missing persons list was also made higher by fraudulent cases, police said, with some individuals attempting to benefit financially from the tragedy. There are a number of ongoing fraud investigations, and earlier this month one man pleaded guilty to fraud after claiming that his wife and son had both died in the fire. The Met is also investigating alleged thefts from seven flats at Grenfell Tower, although no perpetrators have yet been identified, according to BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw. Commander Cundy told BBC News: ""There was only one way in and out of the tower and [CCTV] footage shows 223 people came out and survived."" He said not all 223 people were residents, some were visitors, and some residents were not in the tower at the time. While the final stage of the search operation is not expected to conclude until early December, the Met said in a statement: ""Based on all the work carried out so far and the expert advice, it is highly unlikely there is anyone who remains inside Grenfell Tower"". Specially trained officers from the Met, City of London Police and British Transport Police have been involved in the search and recovery operation, thoroughly searching every single flat on every single floor.

"Two new ""breakthrough"" drugs to treat breast cancer have been given the green light for use on the NHS. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) approved palbociclib and ribociclib after negotiating prices for the treatments. Research shows the drugs slow down advanced cancer for at least 10 months and can delay the need for chemotherapy. Around 8,000 people in England will now have access to the medications. There are about 45,000 new diagnoses of breast cancer in the country each year. Palbociclib had earlier been rejected by NICE because of its high cost. One cycle of palbociclib - or 21 capsules - costs Â£2,950 for a pack of 21. For 63 tablets of ribociclib, the price is the same. Gene test 'narrows down breast cancer risk' BBC reporter films her breast cancer diary 'Why I had a double mastectomy' The latest draft guidance from NICE said that women with oestrogen receptor positive breast cancer that is diagnosed after it has begun to spread will be eligible for palbociclib - also known as Ibrance. If they have gone through the menopause, they will be eligible for ribociclib - also known as Kisqali. This video can not be played Breast cancer drug palbociclib could give women more time to control disease, scientist tells Today The two medications are the first of a new type of drug shown to slow down the progression of cancer by inhibiting two proteins - CDK 4 and 6. They only need to be taken once a day, alongside an aromatase inhibitor - which blocks the production of the hormone oestrogen and can fuel some breast cancers. Vikki Orvice, who was prescribed palbociclib for two years as part of a trial, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the NICE approval was ""brilliant news"". ""It's a life-changing drug for thousands of women and in years to come as well,"" the sports writer from St Albans, Hertfordshire, said. ""You get slight fatigue from it, but it was manageable and I was on the highest dose possible. No one looking at me would have known I was ill... you have a quality of life with so few side effects."" Craig Eagle, head of oncology at Pfizer UK, which manufactured palbociclib, told Today the tablet ""helps control and slow the cancer for up to two years, bringing that extra time for patients in the prime of their life"". He said it was correct that the company had first offered the drug at a price that was rejected by NICE, but they had later come to a ""confidential agreement around the price"". Nicholas Turner, professor of molecular oncology at the Institute of Cancer Research in London, and consultant medical oncologist at the Royal Marsden, said the new drugs were ""one of the most important breakthroughs for women with advanced breast cancer in the last two decades"". Prof Turner, who led the clinical trials for the drugs, said: ""Palbociclib and ribociclib have made a huge difference to women's lives - slowing down tumour growth for nearly a year, and delaying the need for chemotherapy with all its potentially debilitating side-effects. ""These drugs have allowed women to live a normal life for longer.""

"Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has demanded ""an emergency Budget for our public services"", which he says are in crisis. He is promising to spend about Â£17bn a year extra on the NHS, social care, schools and local government. The extra spending would be paid for by tax rises for companies and ""the rich"", while tackling tax avoidance. The government said Labour's plans would lead to more debt, higher taxes and fewer jobs. Chancellor Philip Hammond is due to give his Budget speech next Wednesday afternoon. What to watch for in next week's Budget Borrowing boost for social housing In a speech at Church House in Westminster, Mr McDonnell called for an end to austerity by the government and set out five main proposals: Pause the roll-out of Universal Credit to fix delays in benefits payments Fund public sector pay rises Put more money into infrastructure such as road and rail projects Increase funding for health, education, and local government Launch a large-scale house-building programme. He said the Chancellor, Philip Hammond, was out of touch with the lives of ordinary people and there was growing anger after seven years of austerity. ""They were told austerity was the solution to the economic crisis,"" he said. ""So it's understandable that after seven years of the austerity solution, they are angry when they queue for hours at A&E, see their school laying off teaching assistants, their Surestart centre closing and the local neighbourhood police withdrawn from their streets. ""Especially, while at the same time, they learn about the Paradise Papers and the tax avoidance of the super-rich."" Mr McDonnell said the Conservatives were giving away about Â£76bn in cuts to corporation tax, capital gains tax and ""the rich"" during the life of this Parliament. He said Labour had already calculated Â£6.5bn could be raised from clamping down on tax avoidance, but he believed that could be significantly higher after the leaking of the Paradise Papers. A global investigation looked at 13.4 million previously secret documents that revealed offshore investments made by companies, politicians and wealthy individuals. John McDonnell wants to create a clear red line between him and the present incumbent of Number 11, Philip Hammond. A week ahead of the Budget, the shadow chancellor has said that more should be spent on health, education and housing and that the public sector pay cap of 1% should be lifted. The controversial introduction of the new benefits system - the universal credit - should also be delayed after evidence that some recipients were being left without payments for several weeks. To pay for the new policies, Mr McDonnell will say he is willing to borrow more to invest in infrastructure, arguing it is a good time to do so as interest rates are at historic lows. It is a position rejected by the Conservatives, with Mr Hammond saying that more borrowing now simply means more debts to be repaid in the future. It is expected that he will focus any new spending on health and housing in the Budget, next Wednesday. Mr McDonnell said more action was needed to tackle what he called the ""housing crisis"". The government is towipe about Â£70bn worth of debt from housing associations' balance sheets,allowing them to raise money more cheaply. But Mr McDonnell described it as ""accountancy tricks"" and called for more funding. ""The scale of the crisis demands action on an equal scale. We need at least 100,000 new social homes a-year funded and built by this government, to even begin to address the problem."" He said Mr Hammond could do far more. ""He wants to pretend he cannot invest on the scale needed, yet he has already borrowed more in his first year as chancellor than any of his predecessors in their first year at the Treasury."" Responding to Mr McDonnell's proposals, Chief Secretary to the Treasury Liz Truss said: ""The shadow chancellor has today admitted Labour would borrow billions more and hike up taxes to record levels. ""The costs would rack up and up - putting economic growth at risk and hitting ordinary working people in the pocket. ""Only the Conservatives can build a country that is fit for the future.""

"Social media was Felix's life, his mum Lucy Alexander says The Duke of Cambridge, inspired by a mother's story of loss, has launched a code of conduct to beat cyberbullying. Lucy Alexander's son, Felix, killed himself aged 17 after years of being bullied on social media. The prince, together with tech firms, children's charities and parents, wants young people to follow the equivalent of a Green Cross Code for the internet - to ""stop, speak, support"". Facebook and Snapchat are also set to trial giving access to counselling. Other firms, including Google and EE, have also taken part in the project. At the final meeting of the cyberbullying taskforce at Google's HQ in London, Prince William urged tech giants to ""innovate, collaborate and educate"" people on the dangers of cyberbullying. ""You've heard me say before that this is a personal issue for me,"" he told representatives from Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter and Vodafone. ""My work with the air ambulance saw a lot of suicide, some of it from bullying, some from other areas of life."" The aim of the new code of conduct is to encourage 11 to 16-year-olds across the UK to stop negative behaviour, tell a responsible adult and support victims of bullying. The Duke of Cambridge became interested in helping to tackle the issue shortly after his son Prince George was born, when he first heard about Felix Alexander. 'Ate away at him' In a moving video filmed to highlight the project, Lucy Alexander, from Worcester, told the prince about her son Felix. ""Social media was his life. It was the way everyone communicated, and if you weren't on it, you were isolated. ""If he was invited to a party, someone would text saying: 'You don't want to invite him. Everyone hates him'. ""And all he saw was negative. He saw himself as stupid and ugly,"" she told the prince. ""It just ate away at him inside, I think, but I had no idea of the depth of his despair at all."" How can I keep my kids safe online? Is your child a cyberbully? She believes the prince's initiative could have helped her son in his darkest times. ""It may not have changed my story, but it's got to be a step forward,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. It's bullying behaviour on social networks, games and mobile phones, which can include spreading rumours about someone, or posting mean or embarrassing messages, photos or video. The NSPCC says children may know who is behind the bullying, and it may be an extension of bullying in school or elsewhere. Or the bully may be targeting someone using a fake or anonymous account. Cyberbullying can happen at any time and anywhere, even when a child is alone in their bedroom, making it feel as if there is no escape. Prince William also heard from Chloe Hine, who, aged 13, tried to take her own life after enduring sustained online abuse. ""You can't escape it. You're constantly with that bully,"" she said. She described being part of a group who turned on her after she said something they didn't want to hear. They decided they should all hate her and would twist her words, she said. ""Then it kind of spiralled out of control from there."" The prince highlighted the danger of anonymous bullying - which he says can come directly into a young person's bedroom but remain invisible to those around them. Allow Twitter content?

""It is one thing when it happens in the playground and it's visible there and parents and teachers and other children can see it. ""Online, you're the only one who sees it, and it's so personal. It goes straight to your room."" he said. He also warned against cyber-bullies being able to ignore the real-world consequences of their actions. ""I think it is worth reminding everyone that the human tragedy of what we are talking about here isn't just about companies and online stuff - it's actually real lives that get affected,"" he added. Instagram tops cyber-bullying study How I felt when I ditched social media Cyber-bullying relatively rare, says study Speaking ahead of the meeting, taskforce chairman Brent Hoberman said William was instrumental in doing something that ""almost no-one can do"" by bringing together top representatives of rival companies. He said he wanted to see the trial to give young people access to a counsellor rolled out universally. Asked whether the onus should be on the tech firms to remove the bullying posts or messages, he told BBC's Today programme that removing them may not be as effective as helping the young person emotionally. The message, he said, to young people was ""don't be bystanders - step up speak out, stop this"". The responsibility to deal with this was ""everywhere"", he added. Talk about it - find the right time to approach them with your concerns. Show your support - stay calm, be considered and tell them how you will help them. Don't necessarily stop them going online - this can make them feel more isolated. Help them to deal with it - advise them to tell the person how it makes them feel and ask them to take any pictures or comments down. Don't retaliate - advise them against responding to abusive messages and to leave uncomfortable conversations. Block the bullies - if messages continue, block the sender and report them to the social network or gaming platform. Keep the evidence - take screenshots as proof. Don't deal with it alone - talk to friends or your child's school for support. Know when to take it further - consider telling the police if your child is in danger. Don't stop when the bullying stops - keep talking and consider counselling.

"About 5,000 people are forced to sleep rough on Scotland's streets each year Two thirds of Scots never stop to speak to homeless people, according to a new study. Charity Street Soccer Scotland, which commissioned the research, also said that 41% of those questioned were ""fearful"" of approaching the homeless. The research shows younger people aged 16 to 24 were least likely to stop and talk. It is estimated that each year about 5,000 people are forced to sleep rough on Scotland's streets. Street Soccer Scotland said older age groups were less likely to be anxious about speaking to rough sleepers. Founder and chief executive of the charity David Duke, who was homeless for three years, said: ""Having experienced homelessness I know what it's like to spend your days alone, with no-one to speak to. ""I also know the difference that having someone to talk to can make when you've lost all hope. ""I'm really shocked at the number of people who say they don't stop to speak to people who are homeless, and especially by the number who say they're afraid to."" Last year, 9,187 homelessness applications were received from people aged 16 to 24. Mr Duke, who also sits on the Homelessness and Rough Sleeping Action Group set up by the Scottish government, added: ""Today in Scotland, great strides are being made to eradicate homelessness with progressive laws and a willing government. ""However, unfortunately some things have stayed exactly the same. ""The lack of dignity afforded to people experiencing homelessness, the prejudice and stigma that comes with what is the worst time of your life, is holding our society back. We need to do more to change that.""

"This video can not be played Roy Moore: How Alabamans are defending the accused judge A lawyer for embattled Senate candidate Roy Moore has raised questions about evidence provided by a woman who claims he sexually assaulted her as a teen. Beverly Young Nelson showed Mr Moore's purported signature and message in her high school yearbook as proof of his alleged interest in her. His lawyer cast doubt on the signature and called on Mrs Nelson to release the yearbook for handwriting examination. A number of women have come forward to accuse Mr Moore of sexual misconduct. Many of them accuse him of initiating sexual contact while they were teenage girls. The 70-year-old former Alabama Supreme Court judge has flatly denied the claims. Why people are posting #MeAt14 He tweeted a defiant message - ""Bring. It. On"" - to Mitch McConnell, the Republican Senate majority leader, who is among those to have urged him to quit.

Mr Moore's lawyer, Phillip Jauregui, told reporters on Wednesday the allegations against his client were ""incredibly painful"" and suggested his fifth accuser had altered the judge's signature in her yearbook. ""Was it written by somebody else?"" Mr Jauregui asked, before urging Mrs Nelson's lawyer, Gloria Allred, to release the yearbook to a ""neutral custodian"" to analyse the handwriting. Nelson displayed her 1977 yearbook whilst making her accusation last week He claimed the handwriting was different from the judge's signature. The yearbook message reads: ""To a sweeter more beautiful girl I could not say Merry Christmas. Christmas 1977. Love, Roy Moore, D.A. 12-22-77 Olde Hickory House."" Mrs Nelson said she was 16 years old and working as a waitress at the Olde Hickory House when Mr Moore, who was 30 at the time, allegedly wrote the message. She claims he tried to force himself on her about a week later. This video can not be played 'I was terrified' says Moore accuser Her account followed a Washington Post report quoting four women by name, including one who alleged Mr Moore initiated sexual contact with her when she was 14 - beneath the legal age of consent in Alabama - while he was a prosecutor in his 30s. The newspaper on Wednesday night published two more accounts,externalfrom women who claimed Mr Moore harassed them when they were younger. Gene Richardson, 58, alleges Mr Moore called her at her high school to ask her out. She rebuffed his offer, but said she felt pressured to go out with him after he allegedly asked again at the Gadsden Mall, where she worked. She claims the date ended with a ""forceful"" kiss. Becky Gray, who was 22 at the time, also worked at the mall and said she complained to her manager about Mr Moore's behaviour. She alleges the manager told her it was ""not the first time he had a complaint about him hanging at the mall"". Another accusertold Al.com,externalshe was groped by Mr Moore during a meeting at his law office in 1991, when she was 28 years old. Tina Johnson said she went to see him to sign over custody of her son, who was then 12, to her mother. When the meeting ended, she said Mr Moore grabbed her buttocks. ""He didn't pinch it; he grabbed it,"" she said, noting she didn't tell her mother about the incident. Mr Moore's campaign did not directly address the new allegations but suggested in a statement to the newspaper that the claims were politically motivated. Rajini Vaidyanathan, BBC News, Montgomery, Alabama As the Republican establishment lines up to denounce Roy Moore, many in his home state are standing by him. At a gathering I attended in Montgomery, many GOP voters felt the allegations of misconduct were false, and questioned the timing of their emergence. Was this is Democratic conspiracy, some asked. Why didn't any of this come out before, in the many decades Roy Moore has held public office? Some local Republican associations in the state have issued statements standing by their candidate for the Senate - which makes any national moves to remove him from this race tricky. Many people I've met here say Alabamans don't like being told what to do by people from outside. Roy Moore represents the conservative, evangelical base of the party, which is sick of decrees from the so-called Washington elite. Polls numbers might show the Democrats making ground here in what's usually safe GOP territory - but the fact Roy Moore still has a base of support is why he continues to tweet that he's not going to quit, and why he is still - very much - in this race. Follow @BBCRajiniV,external The news conference came asanother woman accused Mr Moore of sexual misconduct,external, alleging that he groped her in his office when she was 28 years old. Conservatives back firebrand after abuse report Roy Moore on gays, Muslims and Darwin US President Donald Trump's daughter, Ivanka Trump, strongly condemned Mr Moore to the Associated Press news agency on Wednesday. ""There's a special place in hell for people who prey on children,"" she said. ""I've yet to see a valid explanation [from Moore] and I have no reason to doubt the victims' accounts."" President Trump has yet to publicly comment on the controversy while several prominent Republicans have called on him to ""step aside"" in the Senate race. Mr Jauregui on Wednesday disputed Mrs Nelson's claim that she did not have contact with Mr Moore after the alleged 1977 incident. He said the judge presided over Mrs Nelson's divorce in 1999 and suggested she lifted his signature from her court documents from the case. Mr Moore had no recollection of signing ""DA"" after his name, but had an assistant with those initials at the time of Mrs Nelson's divorce who would have stamped it on court filings, Mr Jauregui said. Mr Moore, an outspoken Christian conservative, had been a heavy favourite to win the 12 December election against Democrat Doug Jones.

"Dr Brien wrote the report which formed the basis of one of the government's flagship policies The man who invented Universal Credit has added his voice to growing calls for the benefit to be paid quicker. Stephen Brien, whose report in 2009 became the blueprint for the benefit, told the BBC claimants should receive their first payment after four weeks. Currently people typically have to wait six weeks and one in five wait longer. Theresa May defended the system in the Commons on Wednesday though there is a widespread expectation that changes will be made in next week's Budget. MPs are due to hold a debate on Universal Credit, which merges six benefits for working-age people into one new payment, later on Thursday. Last month the Commons voted overwhelmingly to pause its roll-out but the government did not take part in the ballot and effectively ignored the decision. What is universal credit? Universal credit families 'face eviction' Universal Credit started life in the Centre for Social Justice think tank, under the leadership of Dr Brien. In 2009, he wrote a 370 page report calledDynamic Benefits,external, which became the basis for the new benefit. He then went on to work in the Department for Work and Pension between 2011 and 2013, creating the benefit. While he told the BBC the principle of the idea remains, he believed there were now significant operational problems. ""I would get rid of the seven days (waiting period),"" he said, referring to the initial week after someone makes a claim where they aren't paid any benefit even if they're eligible for Universal Credit. And he also thinks the department doesn't need a week to actually process payments. The system is predicated on making people better off in work But critics warn it is forcing more and more people to turn to food banks ""We should be looking at something much closer to a four-week process. ""When we are looking at a group of people who have lost their job, to expect them to take six weeks on their own back without getting any cash is a challenging one. ""I think we have to recognise that the benefits system needs to focus on the needs of the most vulnerable as much as it focuses on getting people back to work."" Universal credit is the largest change to the welfare system in decades. It combines six working-age benefits, such as tax credits and housing benefit, into one monthly payment. The roll-out of the benefit is currently being accelerated to 50 job centres a month. A number of groups, including Citizens Advice, the Labour Party and the Children's Commissioner for England, have called for the extension to be paused arguing that it is creating debts and rent arrears. The government has so far resisted such demands, arguing the benefit is working and getting single people into a job quicker than previous benefits. Stephen Brien, who currently works for the Legatum Institute, also argues changes made by the government in the 2015 Budget have moved Universal Credit away from its over-riding aim - to make work pay for everyone. ""Certain groups have a greater incentive than they had in the past; others do not, and that's the area we need to fix. It was designed to make work pay. It still makes work pay but not as well as it could and should do."" The 2015 changes to the current system of tax credits means it is currently more attractive for some people to move into work than it will be under Universal Credit. Forthcoming Budgets should address the problem, Dr Brien says. ""There is more value in increasing the work allowances payments for benefit claimants than in increasing the tax threshold for earners. The most vulnerable groups will benefit most from increases in work allowances than raising the threshold of tax."" Universal credit families 'face eviction' How are universal credit rules changing?

"President Mugabe has made his first public appearance He attended a university graduation ceremony Military still referring to him as ""commander-in-chief"" But he is under growing pressure to resign Huge rally planned to demand he steps down Two African leaders urge him to go China calls for ""legal solution"" to crisis US demands ""quick return to civilian rule"" Soldiers remain on the streets of the capital, Harare Some government ministers have been detained The whereabouts of Mr Mugabe's wife remain unclear Dickens Olewe and Farouk Chothia Zimbabwe's first lady, or ""Gucci Grace"" to some, was tipped to be the country's next president. We are ending our live coverage of the army's seizure of power in Zimbabwe. We'll be back if there is any dramatic development. In the meantime, get the latest news from ourour website. We leave you with this photo, which captures the contradiction of the military takeover in Zimbabwe: Mr Mugabe is in office, but not in power: Shingai NyokaBBC Africa, Harare Following guns and explosions on Tuesday night, many thought it was the end for Zimbabwe's long-time leader, Robert Mugabe. But the violence has been replaced by an almost surreal normal. Mr Mugabe  has not yet reached a deal with the military about his future, and does not seem to be losing any sleep over it. For the first time since his arrest, he appeared in public today, conferring degrees on university students in the capital, Harare. Robert Mugabe conferred degrees on more than 3,000 students Sources suggest that he wants to continue as a figurehead until the ruling Zanu-PF party's national congress next month. The catalyst of this crisis, his wife, Grace Mugabe, has not been seen in public. Many suggest that she is confined to their private residence in the capital. It's her ambition to take over as vice-president that set off these events. Mr Mugabe sacked Vice-President Emmerson  Mnangagwa last week and Zanu-PF expelled him, in what was seen as a move to ease his wife's path to power. With Mr Mnangagwa being a former defence minister and a veteran of the war for independence, the military intervened, saying it was targeting ""criminals"" around the president. Read: How to spot a coup Robert Mugabe was widely respected in Africa Where do world leaders go when they're cast out of power and need to find a safe haven fast? President Robert Mugabe famously declared that he would cling to power in Zimbabwe ""until God says 'Come'"". And at the age of 93, he might have expected that hour to arrive before a human intervention. Nonetheless, following the military takeover, the leader of 37 years' standing must now barter himself a future. Even now, the military is still negotiating with Mr Mugabe about his possible resignation, but when - or if - he goes, can he expect a villa in the sun like fallen strongmen of the past? Read full story Stanley KwendaBBC Africa, Kutama To get to President Robert Mugabe's rural home, you drive
along the Robert Mugabe Highway. It is probably one of the most well-maintained roads in
Zimbabwe. It is like driving on a carpet. Along the way you are greeted by a
plaque erected in his honour. Kutama Village is home to the 93-year-old. It is a small and
tightly connected village where everyone knows each other. You cannot  really tell if they have been rattled by the
current political crisis. As we arrived, there was an air of uncertainty. Mr Mugabe
is respected here. To many, he is a father and a friend. Speaking to me at his compound, a 65-year-old neighbour
told me: He's kind, he's a good man and he understands people's plight.""  The man goes to St Francis Xavier Roman Catholic Church with Mr Mugabe, a devout Christian, whenever he visits.   He never demands special treatment. He visits people to check on their welfare.""  Nevertheless, he supported the intervention by the army to remove Mr Mugabe from office, saying it is meant to correct a broken system:  If his term goes out then there's nothing wrong.""  When I approached other villagers, I attracted immediate suspicion. They were not keen to talk. But it seems to me that Mr Mugabe is seen as a hero in the village. It is easy to spot people wearing clothes emblazoned with his face. Police officers are patrolling the area around Mr Mugabe's home. You can't really peep inside the compound because of tight security. Students at the University of Zimbabwe in the capital Harare are hopeful that the country will emerge from its current political crisis stronger, and will be able to deal with its myriad economic and social problems, as BBC Focus on Africa radio heard from them: Kim ChakanetsaBBC World Service President Robert Mugabe, seen here with his wife Grace and daughter Bona, comes from the Shona ethnic group Great weight is placed on respecting your elders among the Shona, which are Zimbabwe's biggest ethnic group. It is one of the fundamental values. At a young age you are taught to greet, speak and interact with elders in a particular manner. For example, when arriving at someone's house, an exchange of greetings will be led by the younger party, who must enquire about the health of every adult present. For girls or women, this could involve kneeling and clapping, then asking each individual in turn about their health. Boys and men will do much the same, but crouching. Failing to do so is frowned upon, and taken as a sign of a poor upbringing or lack of respect. Within the household, grandparents wield considerable influence. This reverence for elders extends beyond your family. Any older woman or man is to be treated in the same way. All 10 provincial committees of Zimbabwe's ruling Zanu-PF party have resolved to remove President Robert Mugabe from office, a UK-based representative of the party has said. The decision is expected to be endorsed by the party's top leadership body, the central committee, which will then elect the man Mr Mugabe sacked as vice-president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, as the acting leader, Nick Mangwana said. Mr Mnangagwa will then be endorsed as the next president at Zanu-PF's national congress, next month, he added in a tweet:  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Schoolchildren formed this mosaic of Robert Mugabe at Independence Day celebrations in April President Robert Mugabe's first public appearance after the military takeover in Zimbabwe will have puzzled some. Here he was at a university graduation ceremony given the authority to hand students their degrees, almost as if nothing had happened. It tells us two things. Firstly, this was political theatre. The suggestion being that behind-the-scenes negotiations over his exit deal are cordial. But it was also more than spectacle. It showed that President Mugabe's opponents want to treat the elder statesman with dignity. As in much of Africa, respecting your elders is ingrained in Zimbabwe's culture. And 93-year-old Robert Mugabe, a liberation fighter who became the country's leader at independence in 1980, is seen as the father of the nation. Read full story Zimbabwe's  #ThisFlag protest movement leader Evan Mawarire has urged people to attend tomorrow's planned rally to demand President Robert Mugabe's resignation so that the southern African state could make a ""fresh start"".

First Lady Grace Mugabe wanted to be the next president A ""palace revolution"" has taken place in Zimbabwe, after a split in the ruling Zanu-PF party over who will succeed President Robert Mugabe, South African political analyst Anthoni van Nieuwkerk has said. Mr Mugabe sacked his deputy, Emmerson Mnangagwa, in what was seen as a move to anoint his wife, Grace, as his successor. Mr Mnangagwa, a former defence minister, vowed to fight back, leading to the current crisis. His allies were grouped in Zanu-PF faction known as Lacoste, while Mrs Mugabe's allies were G-40. Mr Van Nieuwkerk told AFP: It is a palace revolution where one section of the ruling Zanu-PF party is using elements of the military, but not all of the security services - the police for example - to bring change within the ruling party.  Grace Mugabe was trying to get rid of her opponents, who were using aspects of the military to get rid of her.  So it is a limited military intervention with political purposes. The coup is against G-40  The calculation that the military is making is 'let's treat him with dignity and respect as we search for the way forward'. That is why he made the appearance at the university.""  Stanley KwendaBBC Africa, Kutama Villager says that Robert Mugabe understands the plight of people  There is no military presence of in Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe's home village of Kutama, some 90km (55 miles) from the capital, Harare. Many here are aware of the political crisis unfolding but
are reluctant to talk about it. A villager, who did not want to be named, said that people are fond of the nonagenarian president. Mr Mugabe is a good man ""who understands people's plight and likes to mingle with people in the area when he visits"", he said. However, he would not mind if the president, in power since 1980, was forced out of office, the villager added. The military has ended 36 years of loyalty to President Mugabe US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has called for a ""a quick return to civilian rule"" in Zimbabwe, following the army takeover on Wednesday, Reuters news agency reports. He described the situation as ""a concern"", adding: Zimbabwe has an opportunity to set itself on a new path, one that must include democratic elections and respect for human rights.""  Mr Tillerson made the comments to African foreign ministers in Washington, Reuters reports. The US is seeking ""a new era"" in Zimbabwe, the State Department's top official for Africa has said, Reuters news agency reports. Donald Yamamoto added: It's a transition to a new era for Zimbabwe, that's really what we're hoping for.""  Mr Mugabe was a fierce critic of Western powers Regional mediators have been mediating between Mr Mugabe and the army to end the crisis. The army says it has not staged a coup, despite the fact that Mr Mugabe is in its custody. He was allowed to attend a university graduation ceremony earlier today. The army is deployed on the streets of Zimbabwe's capital, Harare China has called for the political crisis in  Zimbabwe to be legally resolved, Reuters news agency reports. Foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters: China calls on all sides in Zimbabwe to keep their eyes on the country's long-term and fundamental interests, and uphold dialogue and consultations to bridge differences, to promote a peaceful and appropriate resolution to the issue under a legal framework.""  China was a key ally of Mr Mugabe, who increasingly pursued a ""Look East"" policy after Western powers condemned his controversial land seizure programme and treatment of the opposition. China gave Mr Mugabe strong backing during the 1970s war for independence, and has invested heavily in the southern African state. Last week, Zimbabwe's army chief Gen Constantino Chiwenga was on an official visit to China when Mr Mugabe fired his deputy Emmerson Mnangagwa. Gen Chiwenga is allied with Mr Mnangagwa, and put Mr Mugabe under house arrest on Wednesday.  The military detained President Robert Mugabe on Wednesday Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe was not accompanied by the presidential guard when he attended a university graduation ceremony in the capital, Harare, opposition politician David Coltart has said. The MDC senator said he had been reliably informed that Mr Mugabe's convoy was made of only three a cars. By allowing him to attend the event, the army generals who put him under house arrest on Wednesday were signalling to the regional bloc, the Southern African Development Community (Sadc), that Mr Mugabe was fine - but at the same time they were ""keeping him in his place"", he said. Sadc is trying to mediate an end to the crisis. Ivory Coast's President Alassane Ouattara has added his voice to calls for President Robert Mugabe, 93, to resign, AFP news agency reports. He praised Mr Mugabe's role  in the fight against colonialism, saying he ""has been the object of respect and  even adulation from many Africans and young Africans"". However, the ""world has changed""  and  because of his age and the ""long  time he has spent in office, everyone is aware that it is time for him to hand  over his seat to a new generation"", Mr Ouattara added. President Robert Mugabe's wife, Grace, 52, harboured ambitions to succeed him Mr Khama has been a strong critic of Mr Mugabe Botswana's President Ian Khama has backed calls for Zimbabwean leader Robert Mugabe to step down, the Reuters news agency reports. He says that the military intervention was ""an opportunity to put Zimbabwe on a path to peace and prosperity"". He added: I don't think anyone should be president for that amount of time [37 years]. We are presidents, we are not monarchs. It's just common sense.""  Botswana is among regional countries working to find a solution to resolve the ongoing political crisis. Mr Khama is a long-standing critic of Mr Mugabe, and has previously called for him to step down. Read: Mugabe - hero or wrecker? Analysis Joseph WinterBBC News website Africa editor Zimbabwe's security chiefs have worked with Mr Mugabe since they fought together in the 1970s war of independence Although the army is obviously calling
the shots in Zimbabwe, in public they still refer to Robert Mugabe as ""his
excellency, the president"" and even ""commander-in-chief"". This is why he has been allowed to
attend the graduation ceremony. This is partly to keep up the pretence that
they have not staged a coup but they also have a genuine, deeply felt respect
for him going back more than 40 years. All of Zimbabwe's security chiefs have
worked with Mr Mugabe since they fought together in the 1970s war of
independence - and the bonds forged in that struggle are difficult to break. In many ways, Zimbabwe's military
remains the armed wing of Zanu-PF, as it was when they were all rebels fighting
white-minority rule in the then Rhodesia. Furthermore, in Zimbabwean culture, the
elderly are treated with respect and no-one wants to be seen to be treating a
93-year-old in an undignified manner, especially a man even opposition figures
refer to as the ""father of the nation"". Zimbabwe's only independent MP - Temba Mliswa - has shared a video message expressing his hope for change in the country. He calls on Zimbabweans who want ""change"" to attend a rally planned to take place tomorrow in the capital, Harare: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Two new ""breakthrough"" drugs to treat breast cancer have been given the green light for use on the NHS. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) approved palbociclib and ribociclib after negotiating prices for the treatments. Research shows the drugs slow down advanced cancer for at least 10 months and can delay the need for chemotherapy. Around 8,000 people in England will now have access to the medications. There are about 45,000 new diagnoses of breast cancer in the country each year. Palbociclib had earlier been rejected by NICE because of its high cost. One cycle of palbociclib - or 21 capsules - costs Â£2,950 for a pack of 21. For 63 tablets of ribociclib, the price is the same. Gene test 'narrows down breast cancer risk' BBC reporter films her breast cancer diary 'Why I had a double mastectomy' The latest draft guidance from NICE said that women with oestrogen receptor positive breast cancer that is diagnosed after it has begun to spread will be eligible for palbociclib - also known as Ibrance. If they have gone through the menopause, they will be eligible for ribociclib - also known as Kisqali. This video can not be played Breast cancer drug palbociclib could give women more time to control disease, scientist tells Today The two medications are the first of a new type of drug shown to slow down the progression of cancer by inhibiting two proteins - CDK 4 and 6. They only need to be taken once a day, alongside an aromatase inhibitor - which blocks the production of the hormone oestrogen and can fuel some breast cancers. Vikki Orvice, who was prescribed palbociclib for two years as part of a trial, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the NICE approval was ""brilliant news"". ""It's a life-changing drug for thousands of women and in years to come as well,"" the sports writer from St Albans, Hertfordshire, said. ""You get slight fatigue from it, but it was manageable and I was on the highest dose possible. No one looking at me would have known I was ill... you have a quality of life with so few side effects."" Craig Eagle, head of oncology at Pfizer UK, which manufactured palbociclib, told Today the tablet ""helps control and slow the cancer for up to two years, bringing that extra time for patients in the prime of their life"". He said it was correct that the company had first offered the drug at a price that was rejected by NICE, but they had later come to a ""confidential agreement around the price"". Nicholas Turner, professor of molecular oncology at the Institute of Cancer Research in London, and consultant medical oncologist at the Royal Marsden, said the new drugs were ""one of the most important breakthroughs for women with advanced breast cancer in the last two decades"". Prof Turner, who led the clinical trials for the drugs, said: ""Palbociclib and ribociclib have made a huge difference to women's lives - slowing down tumour growth for nearly a year, and delaying the need for chemotherapy with all its potentially debilitating side-effects.

"Border staff might be diverted from ""crucial security functions"" after Brexit to cope with a sudden increase in customs activity, MPs have warned. The Commons Home Affairs Committee said a planned 4% increase in Border Force staff was ""completely unconvincing"", warning: ""Security must not be put at risk by government failure to plan."" It also warned of ""major border disruption"" without urgent action. The Home Office said customs officials would have the resources they needed. The UK is due to withdraw from the EU in March 2019 when it will also leave the customs union. MPs warn of Brexit customs 'catastrophe' EU business groups call for Brexit deal The customs union means EU member states do not impose taxes or require customs declarations on goods from other member states. After it leaves, the UK government says it wants to agree a new ""innovative"" model to avoid holdups at the border but negotiations on this have yet to begin and there is expected to be a sharp increase in customs declarations after Brexit. HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) - which handles customs checks - has said it will need an extra 5,000 staff to cope with the extra workload, while the government has promised an extra 300 border staff will be in place on Brexit day. The committee's chairwoman Yvette Cooper warned of ""gridlock"" at the Irish border The cross-party committee of MPs said ""urgent co-ordinated staff planning"" was needed between HMRC and the Border Force. ""We find these plans for such a small increase in border staff completely unconvincing, particularly given the current uncertainty and the need for contingency planning,"" their report said. ""If new customs arrangements require a substantial increase in customs capacity which cannot be delivered in time, then there is a significant risk that Border Force staff will be diverted from crucial security functions, including preventing smuggling, the seizing of dangerous goods and immigration processes. ""The Home Office needs to plan for a significant further increase in border staffing and to ensure that arrangements are in place to prevent large numbers of staff being diverted away from other critical areas."" Countries in the customs union don't impose tariffs - taxes on imports - on each other's goods. Every country inside the union levies the same tariffs on imports from abroad. So, for example, a 10% tariff is imposed on some cars imported from outside the customs union, while 7.5% is imposed on roasted coffee. Other goods - such as soap or slate - have no tariffs. The UK has said it is leaving the EU's customs union because as a member it is unable to strike trade deals with other countries. In the rest of its report, the committee said staying in the customs union during the post-Brexit transition period would cause the ""least upheaval"", calling for ""no practical change to customs operations"" especially at the Irish border. And it said not enough planning was being done for the possibility of no deal with the EU, saying this would lead to a ""huge amount of change in a very short time, with a vast increase required in capacity and processes at the border"". Labour MP Yvette Cooper, chairwoman of the committee, warned of a repeat of the 2015 cross-Channel transport chaos. This led to the implementation of Operation Stack, in which stretches of the M20 in south-east Kent were used to park freight bound for the Channel Tunnel or the Port of Dover. She said: ""As things stand, the government is running the risk of celebrating their first day of Brexit with the sight of queues of lorries stretching for miles in Kent and gridlock on the roads of Northern Ireland, which would be incredibly damaging to the UK economy and completely unacceptable to the country. ""Contingency planning is essential. If the government gets this all wrong, we could be facing Operation Stack on steroids."" The warning follows another report, by the Commons Public Accounts Committee on Tuesday, which warned that failure to complete the introduction of a new customs system by the Brexit date would be ""catastrophic"". A government spokeswoman said it was confident of securing a mutually beneficial customs agreement with the EU but it was responsible to plan for a range of possible scenarios. ""We will ensure we have the resources we need to continue to run effective customs, borders and immigration systems in the future,"" she said. On the 300 additional front-line Border Force officers, the government said the number could change depending on the outcome of negotiations and ""workflow monitoring"".

"Christopher Pyne is Australia's minister for defence industry An Australian government minister has said hackers are responsible for a ""like"" on his Twitter account to a pornographic video. The activity on Minister for Defence Industry Christopher Pyne's profile at about 02:00 local time on Thursday (15:00 GMT Wednesday) was pointed out by other Twitter users. Mr Pyne said hackers had possibly liked the gay pornography as ""mischief"" after Australia's same-sex marriage vote. The ""like"" has since been removed. On Wednesday, Australians learned they had overwhelmingly voted in favour of legalising same-sex marriage in a historic poll. Parliament is now debating changing the law. Australians decisively back gay marriage Mr Pyne, a veteran MP, was appointed to his current ministerial position last yearto deliver a major submarine fleet project. He said he was asleep when the Twitter activity took place. Some Twitter users responded to his explanation with scepticism, while others raised concerns over possible security implications. One independent senator, Cory Bernardi, said it should prompt a ""full investigation and report in case [it is a] foreign agent trying to influence elections"". Many users compared it toa similar incident in September where US senator Ted Cruz's Twitter account ""liked"" a pornographic video.Mr Cruz told reporters the incident was a ""staffing issue"" and ""not malicious"".

"Health authorities said there was no evidence of any broad contamination of game meat A New Zealand family are seriously ill in hospital, with a wild boar they hunted and ate being investigated by doctors as one possible cause. Friends of the family wrote in a Facebook post that Shibu Kochummen, his wife Subi Babu and mother Alekutty Daniel collapsed after eating the meat. Health officials said there is no evidence of any ""broader contaminated game"" or any risk to public health. Two children who did not eat the meat are unaffected. But the three adults in the family had cooked and eaten the boar, before being found on the floor of their home in Waikato by emergency services last Friday, friends of the family said. Joji Varghese told the BBC that doctors are waiting on a toxicology report and that ""the nature of the contaminant is unknown"". In a Facebook post appealing for help, Mr Varghese and other friends of the family wrote of the severity of their condition, adding that officials had sent samples of all food items found in the family's home for testing. The family moved to New Zealand from India five years ago and Mr Kochummen, a hunting enthusiast, had earlier shot the wild boar which they eventually ate. ""We are still investigating potential sources for the illness in this case,"" said Richard Vipond, a medical officer at the Waikato Health Board, in a press release. He added that those who hunt or handle game meat should follow theguidelines set out by the Ministry of Primary Industries,externalto reduce any risk of contamination. Mr Kochummen and Ms Daniel are reportedly stable in a ward, but Ms Babu remains in critical condition, according to Dr Vipond. The Indian High Commission told the New Zealand Herald that embassy staff are working with family and friends.

"Mental health trusts in England are restraining patients on average every 10 minutes, figures have revealed. They show the number of incidents of restraint has increased each year since 2013. Former health minister Norman Lamb said use of force was ""endemic"" in many units. The Department of Health said it was working with the Care Quality Commission (CQC) to ensure the use of restraint is minimised. Figures from 40 mental health trusts in England revealed patients were restrained 59,808 times in 2016-17, equivalent to between six and seven incidents an hour. This compares with 46,499 times in 2013-14. The figures, released to the Liberal Democrats under the Freedom of Information Act, also showed an increase in injuries to patients and staff However, use of the most extreme restraints, where patients are forced to the ground, fell 9% across 33 trusts. Mental health trusts say they have improved their reporting of their use of restraint, which may have contributed to some of the rise. Physical restraint is classed as ""any direct physical contact where the intention is to prevent, restrict, or subdue movement of the body (or part of the body) of another person"". The Department of Health,externalsays there must be ""a real possibility of harm to the person or to staff, the public or others"" for restraint to be used. Liz Rotherham believes it was unnecessary to restrain her Liz Rotherham suffers from psychotic episodes and said she has been restrained in hospital on three occasions. She claimed it happened at the The Linden Centre in Chelmsford and The Lakes in Colchester. The most recent was in 2013. ""I don't know why they felt the need to it,"" said the 46-year-old from Essex. ""I wasn't throwing things around, I wasn't being abusive or anything like that. ""They actually hurt me, which wasn't very nice. I had six people holding me down on a crash mat. They pulled down the side of my knickers and injected me."" She said that a female police officer attending the unit once told her ""don't be a wuss"". ""I will never, ever forget that. I felt like I was being treated like an animal."" Ms Rotherham said she believed someone could have sat down and talked to her without the need for restraint. The Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust, which runs the hospitals, said it could not comment on an individual patient's case. Dr Sridevi Kalidindi of the Royal College of Psychiatrists said the data showed some trusts were making progress but consistent improvements were not being seen across the board. ""The increase in the number of restraints recorded is concerning,"" she said. ""Cuts to bed numbers and community care programmes mean you now have to be more ill to be admitted to a mental health unit."" Dr Kalidindi said increasing use of agency staff meant fewer permanent staff trained to de-escalate situations were available. Mental health: 10 charts on the scale of the problem Mental health staff on stress leave up 22% Lib Dem health spokesman Norman Lamb said: ""Many inspiring units have demonstrated how you can very significantly reduce the use of force, training staff in de-escalation. ""This can avoid situations which lead to stress and conflict. This needs to be given much greater priority by the Government."" Vicki Nash of mental health charity Mind, said: ""Physical restraint can be humiliating, terrifying, dangerous and even life-threatening. ""There is currently a Private Members' Bill going through parliament which, if it becomes law, has the opportunity to increase transparency and accountability around the use of force in mental health settings."" A Department of Health spokeswoman said: ""Physical restraint should only be used as a last resort and our guidance to the NHS is clear on this. ""We want patients to be treated and cared for in a safe environment and we are actively working with the regulator, the Care Quality Commission, to ensure the use of restraint is minimised.""

"This video can not be played The painting has been cleaned and restored from the image on the left to the one on the right A 500-year-old painting of Christ believed to have been painted by Leonardo da Vinci has been sold in New York for a record $450m (Â£341m). The painting is known as Salvator Mundi (Saviour of the World). It is the highest auction price for any work of art and brought cheers and applause at the packed Christie's auction room. Leonardo da Vinci died in 1519 and there are fewer than 20 of his paintings in existence. Read aboutLeonardo da Vinci (1452 -1519) 'Mona Lisa nude sketch' found in France Can buying paintings make you rich? Salvator Mundi, believed to have been painted sometime after 1505, is the only work thought to be in private hands. Bidding began at $100m and the final bid for the work was $400m, with fees bringing the full price up to $450.3m. The unidentified buyer was involved in a bidding contest, via telephone, that lasted nearly 20 minutes. Excitement in the auction room rose as the bids by telephone came in The painting shows Christ with one hand raised, the other holding a glass sphere. In 1958 it was sold at auction in London for a mere Â£45. By then the painting was generally reckoned to be the work of a follower of Leonardo and not the work of Leonardo himself. It apparently was part of King Charles I of England's collection in the 1600s and got lost, but was ""rediscovered"" in 2005. Analysis by Arts Editor Will Gompetz $450m for Salvator Mundi is an astonishing price to have realised, given both its condition and authenticity have been questioned. It shows that ultimately art comes down to belief. And there were plenty of bidders last night who were suitably convinced by its Leonardo da Vinci attribution to drive the price up to such stratospheric heights. As yet, the new owner is unknown. Speculation will be rife. Which I will contribute to, by noting the newly opened Louvre Abu Dhabi will have a Leonardo shaped hole in its displays when the decade-long loan deal with the French museums comes to an end. Wherever it ends up, you've got to hand it to Christie's for its masterclass in the art of selling art. Art agents celebrated when the sale was completed In a bold move, without a hint of irony, the painting was sold in its Post-War and Contemporary Art Evening Sale alongside a Jean-Michel Basquiat and Andy Warhol. Why not in the Old Masters Sale? Because that's not where the elephant bucks are. The big money comes into the room nowadays when Pollocks and Twomblys are on the block, and promptly leaves when the Reynolds and Winterhalters arrive. Read more of Will Gompertz's blogs here. This video can not be played Salvator Mundi was discovered hidden under layers of paint Dr Tim Hunter, who is an expert in Old Master and 19th Century art, told the BBC the painting is ""the most important discovery in the 21st Century"". ""It completely smashes the record for the last Old Masters painting to sell - Van Gogh's Sunflowers in 1988. Records get broken from time to time but not in this way. ""Da Vinci painted less than 20 oil paintings and many are unfinished so it's incredibly rare and we love that in art."" Before the auction it was owned by Russian billionaire collector Dmitry E Rybolovlev, who is reported to have bought it in a private sale in May 2013 for $127.5m (Â£98m). The painting has had major cosmetic surgery - its walnut panel base has been described as ""worm-tunnelled"" and at some point it seems to have been split in half - and efforts to restore it resulted in abrasions. BBC arts correspondent Vincent Dowd said that even now attribution to Leonardo is not universally accepted. One critic has described the surface of the painting to be ""inert, varnished, lurid, scrubbed over and repainted so many times that it looks simultaneously new and old"". ""Any private collector who gets suckered into buying this picture and places it in their apartment or storage, it serves them right,"" Jerry Saltz wrote on Vulture.com. But Christie's has insisted the painting is authentic and billed it as ""the greatest artistic rediscovery of the 20th Century"". Georgina Adam, who is an Art Market specialist, told the BBC the price of the piece is ""fuelled by the sheer amount of money that billionaires have."" ""This is the last Leonardo painting you can buy. This isn't as a store of value, it's the ultimate trophy - only one person in the world can own this. ""If you think of the wealth of some billionaires, Bill Gates is worth 87 billion, and I'm not saying it's him, but near to half a billion would not be a colossal chunk out of his income for example."" The auction house has not revealed who purchased the picture, but Hunter speculates it could be a buyer from Asia or even be on the way to the newLouvre in Abu Dhabi. Could the painting be headed for Abu Dhabi's new Louvre Museum? ""It's the sort of painting you can imagine as a star piece in a private collection and as billionaire collectors like to set up their own museums, it could be a good piece for them,"" Hunter said. Adam also thinks the piece could have gone to an Asian market. ""We don't know who bought it, I went to the Louvre in Abu Dhabi and I did wonder whether the Gulf could be responsible. ""People are thinking the Far East, the picture was taken to Hong Kong before it was put up for sale to show to possible buyers there so that is possible.

"Robert Mugabe met the army chief who led the move against him Zimbabwe's long-time President Robert Mugabe has been holding direct talks with the army over his future. Pictures emerged of the 93-year-old meeting the army chief and two envoys from South Africa at his official residence in Harare. The army put Mr Mugabe under house arrest on Wednesday after moving in to take control. Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai says Mr Mugabe must resign but sources suggest the president is resistant. The crisis stems from a power struggle in recent months over who might succeed him - his wife Grace Mugabe or former Vice President Emmerson Mnangagwa. Last week, Mr Mugabe came down in favour of his wife, sacking Mr Mnangagwa and provoking the ire of the army chiefs. The view from Zimbabwe: Any change will do The basics: Five things you should know about Zimbabwe The Mugabes and other key players in profile It's very unclear. Photos in the Zimbabwe Herald showed Mr Mugabe meeting army chief Gen Constantino Chiwenga,externaland the two South African envoys from the Southern African Development Community (Sadc) at State House in Harare. Alongside them was Father Fidelis Mukonori, a Roman Catholic priest known to Mr Mugabe for years, who has been brought in to mediate. Sources close to the talks say Mr Mugabe - who has been in control of Zimbabwe since it threw off white minority rule in 1980 - is refusing to stand down voluntarily before next year's planned elections. This video can not be played Who is Grace Mugabe? ""He is refusing to step down. I think he is trying to buy time,"" one source close to the army leadership told the AFP news agency. Zanu-PF officials had earlier suggested Mr Mugabe could remain nominally in power until the party congress in December, when Mr Mnangagwa would be formally installed as party and national leader. By Anne Soy in Zimbabwe Many Zimbabweans almost instantly warmed to the military's move to take control of the country, and confine President Mugabe to his official residence. ""The military has done a good thing,"" says one bookseller. ""They will ensure we get a transitional government."" He is firmly convinced that Mr Mugabe's 37-year rule is coming to an end. There has been a sudden change of tone in the country, and the sense is that many Zimbabweans have been yearning for change. Any change, it seems, would do. Read more on this South Africa is hosting millions of Zimbabweans who fled after the country's economy crashed in 2008. It has a special interest in seeing stability restored. South African Defence Minister Nosiviwe Maphisa-Nqakula and State Security Minister Bongani Bongo are the envoys meeting Mr Mugabe on behalf of Sadc, which South Africa currently leads. This video can not be played Mugabe: From war hero to resignation They will be pushing for a democratic solution. The body, which represents 16 countries, does not support coup-led governments as this would set a dangerous precedent in the largely peaceful region, says the BBC's Pumza Fihlani in Johannesburg. The head of the African Union (AU), Guinean President Alpha CondÃ©, was clear the AU would ""in no case accept"" a military seizure of power. He said he was ""inviting the army to return to its barracks and return to constitutional order"". Mr Tsvangirai,head of the Movement for Democratic Change-Tsvangirai (MDC-T) partyand the main opposition leader in Zimbabwe, said on Thursday: ""In the interests of the people, Mr Robert Mugabe must resign... immediately."" Mr Tsvangirai, who has been abroad receiving treatment for cancer, also called for a ""negotiated all-inclusive transitional mechanism"" that would lead to ""comprehensive reforms for free and fair elections to be held"". This has been echoed by another Zimbabwean opposition leader, Tendai Biti, who also spoke of the need for a ""transitional period"". This video can not be played Andrew Harding: ""There's a feeling people want to celebrate"" Early reports suggested Mrs Mugabe had fled to Namibia, but sources now say she is in the family compound along with senior figures from the ""Generation-40"" group that backs her - cabinet ministers Jonathan Moyo and Saviour Kasukuwere. On Wednesday, one of her key allies, Zanu-PF youth wing leader Kudzai Chipanga, made a televised apology for criticising the head of the army as a war of words raged prior to the military takeover. Mr Chipanga is thought to be in army custody but insisted his statement was voluntary. Local media reports say a number of other senior members of the ""Generation-40"" group have also been detained. What next for Robert Mugabe? Why did the army act now? How to tell if you're in a coup In the early hours of Wednesday, Zimbabwe's military took over the headquarters of national broadcaster ZBC and issued a statement saying they were targeting ""criminals"" around President Mugabe. Troops and armoured vehicles encircled parliament and other key buildings throughout the day. On Monday, Gen Chiwenga had warned the army would intervene to end what he called the ""purging"" of Zanu-PF members ""with a liberation background"", referring to the country's struggle for independence. Mr Mnangagwa is one such veteran of the 1970s war which led to independence. Zimbabwe yearns for change of any kind Profile: Morgan Tsvangirai Did Mugabe go too far?

"MPs took part in Prime Minister's Questions before embarking on a second day of debate The second day of debate in the Commons over the EU Withdrawal Bill has ended with the government winning every vote. Amendments had been put forward by Labour regarding issues such as employment rights and environmental legislation after Brexit. However, the government managed to win five votes during the course of the day - despite its majority falling as low as 12 at times. The dates of six more debating days in the Commons will be confirmed later. A guide to the EU Withdrawal Bill No defeats as MPs debate key Brexit bill Labour attacks Brexit date 'gimmick' If passed, the withdrawal bill will bring existing EU law into UK law and allow the government to use so-called Henry VIII powers to change it without full parliamentary scrutiny. The powers have been criticised by members on both sides of the House, and one of Labour's amendments called for full debates before changes to any EU laws. Shadow Brexit minister Matthew Pennycook said the powers could be used to ""chip away at rights, entitlements, protections and standards that the public enjoy and wish to retain"". Conservative former Attorney General Dominic Grieve agreed with Mr Pennycook, saying that laws of ""very considerable importance"" to the public would be brought to the ""lowest possible status"" without full scrutiny. But Ken Clarke was the only Tory MP to vote for the amendment and it was defeated by 311 votes to 299 - with nine DUP MPs and two former Tories sitting as independents voting with the government. Six more days of debates are required before completing the committee stage of the bill. Commons leader Andrea Leadsom is expected to confirm the dates later. Solicitor general Robert Buckland said: ""The Brexit process will in no way whatsoever be used to undermine or curtail the rights of workers that have been enshrined both in domestic law and in law by virtue of the EU."" He also hinted that concessions may be made at the next stage in the progress of the bill - the report stage - when it returns to Parliament.

"This video can not be played Torrential rain overnight created fast-flowing torrents of red mud Flash floods caused by heavy overnight rain have killed at least 15 people and caused destruction in central Greece. The industrial towns of Mandra, Nea Peramos and Megara, west of the capital Athens, were the most affected. Many of the dead were elderly people whose bodies were found inside their homes, reports say. Fast-flowing torrents of red mud flooded roads. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras declared a period of national mourning in the wake of the tragedy. ""Everything is lost. The disaster is biblical,"" Mandra Mayor Yianna Krikouki told state broadcaster ERT. At least 37 people have been taken to hospital, the broadcaster said, and some are still missing. Grim weather warning for Europe's future Bad weather has hit parts of Greece for about a week, but particularly heavy rain overnight caused the sudden flooding, for which locals said they were unprepared. The force of the water moved vehicles, damaged walls and roofing, and left many homeless as their homes flooded to a life-threatening level. By Wednesday afternoon, Greece's fire service said it had received over 600 calls for help and dispatched almost 200 firefighters in 55 vehicles to the towns, which have a combined population in the tens of thousands. ""The water came down the mountain, millions of tonnes,"" Stavros Fotiou, the deputy mayor of Nea Peramos, told ERT. ""Our roads are completely destroyed... 1,000 homes have been flooded, that's a third of the town,"" he added. Some roads were inundated by more than 1m (3ft) of water The region's deputy governor, Yiannis Vassileiou, told the broadcaster that emergency services had been prepared for poor weather, but then ""the Niagara Falls came down and could not be stopped"". Prime Minister Tsipras said that declaring a period of national mourning was ""the least we can do"". He also vowed to provide aid to the victims and ensure they were housed safely. A state of emergency has been declared in some of the affected areas The fire service said there were more than 300 calls for help Emergency teams have been deployed to the region Grim weather warning for Europe's future Warming shifts timing of European floods Greece country profile At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

"This video can not be played Which cities might suffer as the ice melts A forecasting tool reveals which cities will be affected as different portions of the ice sheet melt, say scientists. It looks at the Earth's spin and gravitational effects to predict how water will be ""redistributed"" globally. ""This provides, for each city, a picture of which glaciers, ice sheets, [and] ice caps are of specific importance,"" say the researchers. The tool has been developed by scientists at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California. Their findings are published in the journal Science Advances,external. Senior scientist Dr Erik Ivins said: ""As cities and countries attempt to build plans to mitigate flooding, they have to be thinking about 100 years in the future and they want to assess risk in the same way that insurance companies do."" Andthis new tool provided a way for them to work out which ice sheets they should be ""most worried about"".,external It suggests that in London sea-level rise could be significantly affected by changes in the north-western part of the Greenland ice sheet. While for New York, the area of concern is the ice sheet's entire northern and eastern portions. Sea level changes in Sydney, the forecast shows, are ""very strongly influenced"" by ice changes that occur along the north-northeast and north-northwest coasts of Antarctica. Dr Eric Larour, the lead developer on this project from Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, explained that three key processes influenced the ""sea-level fingerprint"", or pattern of sea-level change around the world. The first is gravity. ""These [ice sheets] are huge masses that exert an attraction on the ocean,"" said Dr Larour. ""When the ice shrinks, that attraction diminishes- and the sea will move away from that mass."" As well as this ""push-pull influence"" of ice, the ground under a melting ice sheet expands vertically, having previously been compressed by the sheer weight of ice. The forecasting tool provides a fingerprint showing, in red, the area of concern for sea level rise in a particular city. This map of the Antarctic ice sheet was generated for Cape Town. The last factor involves the rotation of the planet itself. ""You can think of the Earth as a spinning top,"" said Dr Larour. ""As it spins it wobbles and as masses on its surface change, that wobble also changes. ""That, in turn, redistributes water around the Earth."" By computing each of these factors into their calculations, the researchers were able to build their city-specific forecasting tool. ""We can compute the exact sensitivity - for a specific town - of a sea level to every ice mass in the world,"" Dr Larour told BBC News. ""This gives you an idea, for your own city, of which glaciers, ice sheets and ice caps are of specific importance."" Another member of the team, Dr Surendra Adhikari, said: ""People can be desperate to understand how these huge, complicated global processes impact on them. ""With this tool, they can see the impact on their own city.""

"This video can not be played Roy Moore: How Alabamans are defending the accused judge A lawyer for embattled Senate candidate Roy Moore has raised questions about evidence provided by a woman who claims he sexually assaulted her as a teen. Beverly Young Nelson showed Mr Moore's purported signature and message in her high school yearbook as proof of his alleged interest in her. His lawyer cast doubt on the signature and called on Mrs Nelson to release the yearbook for handwriting examination. A number of women have come forward to accuse Mr Moore of sexual misconduct. Many of them accuse him of initiating sexual contact while they were teenage girls. The 70-year-old former Alabama Supreme Court judge has flatly denied the claims. Why people are posting #MeAt14 He tweeted a defiant message - ""Bring. It. On"" - to Mitch McConnell, the Republican Senate majority leader, who is among those to have urged him to quit.

Mr Moore's lawyer, Phillip Jauregui, told reporters on Wednesday the allegations against his client were ""incredibly painful"" and suggested his fifth accuser had altered the judge's signature in her yearbook. ""Was it written by somebody else?"" Mr Jauregui asked, before urging Mrs Nelson's lawyer, Gloria Allred, to release the yearbook to a ""neutral custodian"" to analyse the handwriting. Nelson displayed her 1977 yearbook whilst making her accusation last week He claimed the handwriting was different from the judge's signature. The yearbook message reads: ""To a sweeter more beautiful girl I could not say Merry Christmas. Christmas 1977. Love, Roy Moore, D.A. 12-22-77 Olde Hickory House."" Mrs Nelson said she was 16 years old and working as a waitress at the Olde Hickory House when Mr Moore, who was 30 at the time, allegedly wrote the message. She claims he tried to force himself on her about a week later. This video can not be played 'I was terrified' says Moore accuser Her account followed a Washington Post report quoting four women by name, including one who alleged Mr Moore initiated sexual contact with her when she was 14 - beneath the legal age of consent in Alabama - while he was a prosecutor in his 30s. The newspaper on Wednesday night published two more accounts,externalfrom women who claimed Mr Moore harassed them when they were younger. Gene Richardson, 58, alleges Mr Moore called her at her high school to ask her out. She rebuffed his offer, but said she felt pressured to go out with him after he allegedly asked again at the Gadsden Mall, where she worked. She claims the date ended with a ""forceful"" kiss. Becky Gray, who was 22 at the time, also worked at the mall and said she complained to her manager about Mr Moore's behaviour. She alleges the manager told her it was ""not the first time he had a complaint about him hanging at the mall"". Another accusertold Al.com,externalshe was groped by Mr Moore during a meeting at his law office in 1991, when she was 28 years old. Tina Johnson said she went to see him to sign over custody of her son, who was then 12, to her mother. When the meeting ended, she said Mr Moore grabbed her buttocks. ""He didn't pinch it; he grabbed it,"" she said, noting she didn't tell her mother about the incident. Mr Moore's campaign did not directly address the new allegations but suggested in a statement to the newspaper that the claims were politically motivated. Rajini Vaidyanathan, BBC News, Montgomery, Alabama As the Republican establishment lines up to denounce Roy Moore, many in his home state are standing by him. At a gathering I attended in Montgomery, many GOP voters felt the allegations of misconduct were false, and questioned the timing of their emergence. Was this is Democratic conspiracy, some asked. Why didn't any of this come out before, in the many decades Roy Moore has held public office? Some local Republican associations in the state have issued statements standing by their candidate for the Senate - which makes any national moves to remove him from this race tricky. Many people I've met here say Alabamans don't like being told what to do by people from outside. Roy Moore represents the conservative, evangelical base of the party, which is sick of decrees from the so-called Washington elite. Polls numbers might show the Democrats making ground here in what's usually safe GOP territory - but the fact Roy Moore still has a base of support is why he continues to tweet that he's not going to quit, and why he is still - very much - in this race. Follow @BBCRajiniV,external The news conference came asanother woman accused Mr Moore of sexual misconduct,external, alleging that he groped her in his office when she was 28 years old. Conservatives back firebrand after abuse report Roy Moore on gays, Muslims and Darwin US President Donald Trump's daughter, Ivanka Trump, strongly condemned Mr Moore to the Associated Press news agency on Wednesday. ""There's a special place in hell for people who prey on children,"" she said. ""I've yet to see a valid explanation [from Moore] and I have no reason to doubt the victims' accounts."" President Trump has yet to publicly comment on the controversy while several prominent Republicans have called on him to ""step aside"" in the Senate race. Mr Jauregui on Wednesday disputed Mrs Nelson's claim that she did not have contact with Mr Moore after the alleged 1977 incident. He said the judge presided over Mrs Nelson's divorce in 1999 and suggested she lifted his signature from her court documents from the case. Mr Moore had no recollection of signing ""DA"" after his name, but had an assistant with those initials at the time of Mrs Nelson's divorce who would have stamped it on court filings, Mr Jauregui said. Mr Moore, an outspoken Christian conservative, had been a heavy favourite to win the 12 December election against Democrat Doug Jones.

"This video can not be played HMP The Mount: Footage shows riot-trained staff at jail No prisoners will be prosecuted over a two-day riot in which armed inmates took over a wing and smashed windows, it has emerged. Riot-trained officers were sent to HMP The Mount, Hertfordshire, aftertrouble broke out on 31 July and 1 August. Hertfordshire Police said it had exhausted all lines of inquiry and no charges would be brought. Prisoners ""must not feel they can do anything"" without legal recourse, the Prison Officers' Association said. Police said reports were received on 31 July that prisoners had ""threatened prison officers and caused damage to the prison"" over a 10-hour period. At the time, it was reported by BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw that one wing and half of another were ""lost"". Riot-trained staff with shields entered HMP The Mount during a 10-hour disturbance on Monday, 31 July The following day it was reported to police that a prisoner had been assaulted by two inmates, while well-placed sources told the BBC armed prisoners had taken over the Nash wing of the prison. A ""nucleus of about 30 prisoners"" was said to have been involved in the violence. A Hertfordshire Police spokeswoman said the force would investigate any further information if it came to light. Obtaining evidence from a prison environment is not as straightforward as it seems. In the absence of CCTV footage or body-worn cameras - which have yet to be rolled out to all jails - investigators have to rely on witnesses. And when those witnesses are prisoners that becomes problematic. Some may fear reprisals if they speak to police, others might give false evidence to implicate others. It will be immensely disappointing to the prison authorities and staff that police were unable to bring anyone to justice for the trouble at The Mount, let alone have enough evidence to send a file to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). The message that troublemakers can get away with it is not one the Prison Service wants prisoners to hear. The Prison Officers Association said it was ""disappointed"" criminal proceedings were not being pursued. ""The incident resulted in significant damage to the prison and costs to the tax payer,"" a spokesman said. ""Prisons have CCTV in all accommodation areas and so we are surprised evidence is not available to assist the police."" HMP The Mount was designed as a category C training prison built on the site of a former RAF station on the outskirts of Bovingdon village, Hertfordshire The Mount Prison opened in 1987 as a young offenders institution and now houses more than 1,000 prisoners. It was designed as a category C training prison built on the site of a former RAF station on the outskirts of Bovingdon village, Hertfordshire. The prison is described as a ""hybrid training and resettlement prison"" for inmates in the final six months of their sentences. A report in 2016 by the Independent Monitoring Board (IMB) found ""all the ingredients"" were in place for The Mount to suffer disorder such as has been experienced in other prisons: Staff shortages, Readily available drugs Mounting violence The CPS said it had not received a referral from police in relation to this matter. The Ministry of Justice said it would not comment as it was a matter for the police. The BBC also asked the Ministry of Justice in October for the cost of repairs to the prison but was told a final amount was not yet available. This followed a previous Freedom of Information request for a report into the disturbance, which was refused. A ""tornado team"" entered HMP The Mount to tackle to disturbances On the second day of trouble at The Mount, about 30 inmates at Erlestoke prison in Wiltshire also became violent and four people were reported to have been taken to hospital. In October, prison staff wereattacked with pool ballsat the high-security HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire. Police have previously brought charges against those in other prisons involved in disturbances. In September,six inmates were convictedfor their part in a 15-hour riot at HMP Birmingham in December 2016.

"This video can not be played 'It's enough. Him and his government need to go' Zimbabwean exiles have gathered outside the country's embassy in London to celebrate the arrest of Robert Mugabe. Many of them are members of theZimbabwe Human Rights Organisation,external,  a UK charity which has protested weekly against the abuses of the Harare government. On Wednesday they came to celebrate what they hope is the fall of Mugabe. We spoke to some of them. Chipo Parirenyatwa  is 50  and is Chair of the Zimbabwe Human Rights Organisation. She came to the UK in 2000 after her husband was forced to flee the country because of his opposition to the Mugabe Government. ""I am happy with what's happened but today is a comma not a full stop. We need real change. ""Mugabe and his family treated the country as their personal possession and a lot of people are very loyal to them.

"President Mugabe's ties to the military date from the liberation struggle Zimbabwe's military says its actions do not amount to a takeover. It still refers to Robert Mugabe as the commander-in-chief of the country's defence forces. But practically speaking, Mr Mugabe is not in charge if his forces can step in to usurp his authority. This is not a coup d'Ã©tat in name, but it appears to be in action. The military takeover of the national broadcaster, the presence of troops on the streets and major access points, and even forced entry into the presidential palace are traits of a military takeover - at least as we have seen them in Africa. One thing that is lacking is that the constitution has not been suspended. The cementing of democracy across Africa has led to a general regional and continent-wide aversion to violent takeovers of government. Even in the past, coup-stagers often promised a quick handover to civilian government through elections or a negotiated transition. The military says it has not taken control of the country So far in Zimbabwe, the military is not showing any intention of assuming a governing role. However, it has someone it would prefer to do that. Emmerson Mnangagwa, the recently sacked vice-president, is held in high regard in Zimbabwean military circles. The polarising Grace Mugabe Mnangagwa - the 'crocodile' who snapped back How can you tell a coup is happening? He was involved in the struggle for independence, and in 1980 created the Zimbabwe National Army by fusing the Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (Zipra) and Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (Zanla) with the remnants of the former Rhodesian security forces. He was seen as the natural successor for the top office. President Mugabe sacked Mr Mnangagwa last week at the prompting of the First Lady Grace Mugabe, who has political aspirations and has publicly opposed the former vice president, but does not have support within a military where the liberation legacy is held in high esteem. Grace Mugabe is a divisive figure in Zimbabwe The top military officials were part of the liberation struggle, like their comrade and president Mr Mugabe, so they have supported his government over the years because he has served their interests. They did not act this way in 2014, when Mr Mugabe sacked his previous Vice President Joice Mujuru, a former independence fighter, in a similar power struggle. This time though, there is a sense the president might have gone too far. Gen Chiwenga said that the military would not allow the purging of leaders with a liberation background from the governing party Earlier this week, the commander of Zimbabwe's Defence Forces, General Constantino Chiwenga, warned the Zanu-PF governing party to stop the purge against independence war veterans. Following his dismissal and escape to South Africa, Mr Mnangagwa promised to return to regain control of the ruling party from the Mugabes. This suggested his confidence in the support he had from the military. Emmerson Mnangagwa is highly respected in army circles So the next step would be to negotiate his return ahead of the party congress in December, where he could be affirmed as the president's successor. At worst, the military will force Mr Mugabe to resign - but they will not want to humiliate him further because of the history they share. They will also extend the courtesy to Grace Mugabe, in spite of her recent actions. Prior suggestions that the armed forces were divided have not been revealed so far this week. The rise of an opposing faction would probably be bloody, and not something Zimbabweans would like to see, regardless of how tough life has been in recent years. The end of the Mugabe era would be a relief to many, but Mr Mnangagwa is not necessarily popular in all parts of the country. Under his tenure as security minister in the early 1980s, government forces crushed a rebellion in the Midlands and Matebeleland province, and allegedly killed thousands of civilians. There is still bitter resentment among people from the affected regions. Robert Mugabe 'under house arrest' Zimbabwe latest: Key players How can you tell a coup is happening?

"Tony Blair pulled out of talks to fund Robert Mugabe's controversial land reforms in 1997 Britain's relationship with Zimbabwe has always been complex. A former imperial power can feel torn between a responsibility towards its ex-colony and a reluctance to interfere in what is now an independent state. And a freshly minted nation can feel resentment towards its former ruler while also hoping to maintain longstanding trade and cultural links. Thus it has been for London and Harare. Take, for example, President Mugabe. For years, he has railed against Britain and its political leaders as they opposed his disastrous land reforms, his persecution of white farmers and his calamitous management of Zimbabwe's economy. But Mr Mugabe is also an Anglophile who loves cricket, the Royal Family and Savile Row suits. He developed a surprising friendship with Lord Soames, the last British governor of what was then Rhodesia, whose son, Nicholas, the Conservative MP, he saw only a few weeks ago. And when Mr Mugabe's cabinet colleagues were celebrating the fall of Margaret Thatcher in 1990, he rebuked them, reportedly saying: ""Who organised our independence? Let me tell you - if it hadn't been for Mrs Thatcher none of you would be here today. I'm sorry she's gone."" Zimbabwe began life as a colony of the British South African Company in the late 19th Century, run by the British empire-builder, Cecil Rhodes. The moment Zimbabwean MPs hear Mugabe has resigned - BBC News In the 1920s, Southern Rhodesia, as it was then known, was annexed by the United Kingdom but with an element of self-government. The white minority ruled for decades, but were increasingly challenged by nationalist campaigners. Eventually, in 1965, the government led by Ian Smith unilaterally declared independence from Britain. UDI, as it was known, prompted international outrage and sanctions. Years of guerrilla warfare in the bush led to pressure for a negotiated settlement in Rhodesia, and, in 1979, Britain hosted all-party talks at Lancaster House in London. And from this process emerged a peace agreement, a new constitution and a former guerrilla fighter and leader called Robert Mugabe - the first prime minister of a newly independent Zimbabwe. Robert Mugabe has said he trusted Margaret Thatcher - in contrast to Tony Blair Even then, Britain's relations with Mr Mugabe were ambiguous. Politicians and diplomats at the time placed a huge amount of faith in him as exactly the kind of strong, pro-western leader that Zimbabwe would need to embed its new-found independence and democracy. But he nevertheless was still able to wind them up. Robert Mugabe: Hero or villain? Lord Carrington, Britain's foreign secretary who chaired the Lancaster House talks, described him as ""devious and clever, he was the archetypal cold fish"". On a dull moment in the talks, Lord Carrington rejoiced with glee when he discovered that Mugabe reads backwards as ""E ba gum"". Lord Hurd, another British foreign secretary, told The Africa Report that: ""Mugabe was one of those people the British Empire created who specialised in knowing how to twist the British government's tail. He was well-trained in the art of annoying the British if he needed to. He knew our ways."" At first, Britain was hopeful about Zimbabwe's prospects. And normal relations were maintained. The Princess of Wales visited Mr Mugabe in Harare in 1993. The England cricket team, led by Michael Atherton, played Zimbabwe in Harare in 1996. But over the decades of Mr Mugabe's rule, as the country slipped into greater autocracy and economic decline, relations deteriorated. Campaigner Peter Tatchell protested regularly in London against Robert Mugabe In 1997, Tony Blair's government pulled out of talks to fund Mr Mugabe's controversial land reforms. The Zimbabwean president accused the British of meddling in his country's affairs by funding his political opponents. Britain began to withdraw development aid and sanctions were imposed on the president and his inner circle. Campaigners such as Peter Tatchell would protest regularly against Mr Mugabe's homophobia outside the hotel in St James' where the president stayed on his frequent visits to London. Yet through all this, Mr Mugabe still hoped Britain might help revive his country's ailing economy. As he told a crowd a few years ago when he was celebrating his 90th birthday: ""The British, we don't hate you, we only love our country better.""

Later, soldiers seized the headquarters of Zimbabwe's national broadcaster ZBC and explosions and gunfire were heard. Maj-Gen Sibusiso Moyo then read out a statement on national television, assuring the nation that President Mugabe and his family were safe. This video can not be played Maj Gen Sibusiso Moyo read out a statement on national TV early on Wednesday The military was only targeting what he called ""criminals"" around the president, he said, denying that there had been a coup. ""As soon as we have accomplished our mission we expect that the situation will return to normalcy,"" he added. President Mugabe was being held at his home and was ""fine"", according to a statement by South Africa's President Jacob Zuma, who spoke to him on Wednesday. On Thursday,he was pictured taking part in talks with Gen Constantino Chiwengaand South African government ministers at State House. The South African envoy has been trying to help the two sides reach a deal on Mr Mugabe's future, but sources suggest he may be resisting pressure to resign. On Friday, the president gave out degrees at a university of which he is chancellor, thereby meeting a prior commitment. The military said on Friday that they had detained some ""criminals"", but they did not give names. On Saturday, tens of thousands of Zimbabweans took to the streets of Harare to urge Mr Mugabe to go. It was led by veterans of the country's war of independence, who last year turned against him. ""There's no going back about Mugabe,"" said veterans leader Christopher Mutsvangwa. ""He must leave."" On Sunday, Zanu-PF sacked Mr Mugabe as its leader. Meanwhile main opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai, who has been receiving cancer treatment in South Africa, returned to Zimbabwe amid suggestions that his Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) could form part of a possible transitional government. There has not been any official government response to events. Nor have we heard directly from President Mugabe or his wife Grace which, according to analysts, suggests they have lost control. When Mr Mugabe spoke at the university on Friday, he did not make any political comment. And there are no reports of any members of the security forces who remain loyal to Mr Mugabe intervening to defend him. Zimbabwe takeover: Five things you should know SA delegation tries to find resolution This is all about the leadership succession, as Mr Mugabe's powers finally falter. The people who fought in the 1970s guerrilla war against white minority rule still dominate Zimbabwe's government, and especially its security forces, and they are worried about losing that power, and the wealth it generates. Last week, the army chief Gen Chiwenga warned the military could intervene to halt purges of the governing Zanu-PF that were ""clearly targeting members of the party with a liberation background"". This video can not be played Who is Grace Mugabe? This was obviously a reference to the sacking last week of Mr Mnangagwa, Mr Mugabe's once loyal deputy and a former defence minister, spy chief and veteran of the war of independence. Mrs Mugabe's supporters are known as ""Generation 40"" or ""G40"" - a name which signals a changing of the guard in Zimbabwe, at least partially, 37 years after independence. So this military action is the old guard reasserting its authority. Mr Mugabe was the political leader of the guerrilla war so the army has always professed loyalty to him, until he explicitly came out in favour of his wife taking over from him. The rise of Grace Mugabe Mnangagwa: The 'crocodile' who snapped back Most observers think so. The army's denial it was carrying out a coup has been mocked on social media. The BBC's southern Africa correspondent Andrew Harding called the move an ""extraordinary gamble"". He sees it as an internal power struggle within Zanu-PF ""and whoever emerges victorious can expect a newly purged party to fall obediently into line"". He says it is important to remember that Mr Mugabe is not being challenged by Western governments, or by Zimbabwe's political opposition, or by a mass uprising against economic hardship. How can you tell a coup is happening? There appears to have been no dramatic effect on normal life. People say shops have opened as normal. The military thanked the public ""for remaining patient and peaceful as they carry out the operation"". Some Zimbabweans told the BBC that they welcomed the news, with one man expressing his thanks to the army for ""taking out the tyrant"". This video can not be played Zimbabweans react to the news that troops had taken control One resident of Harare though told the Press Association: ""I don't think I see how anything could possibly be different. If we wanted to see any change we would have to assassinate about 5,000 people all feeding from the same trough."" The head of the key regional bloc the African Union, Guinea's president Alpha Conde, said that the crisis ""seems like coup"". He said the AU demanded that ""constitutional order be restored immediately"". In his statement, South Africa's President Zuma said that he was sending a delegation to Zimbabwe to meet President Mugabe and the Zimbabwean Defence Force. Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari has urged ""respect for the constitution"", and said every attempt should be made to save the country from ""political instability"". The leaders of Botswana and the Ivory Coast called on Mr Mugabe to leave his post, both focusing on his age and the amount of time he had been president. US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson called for a ""quick return to civilian rule"" and the UK - Zimbabwe's former colonial ruler - said it hoped elections scheduled for 2018 would take place as planned.

"Zimbabwe's The Herald newspaper ran a special edition later on Wednesday Zimbabwean media have been slow to keep their audiences up to date on developments after the military took control earlier today. State TV and radios were re-broadcasting the statement by Major-General Sibusiso Moyo announcing that the military had taken over but offered little by way of updates to the situation. For most of the morning the TV played patriotic songs from the independence period of the 1980s before resuming normal programming. The lunchtime news featured the army takeover as the main story. What we know so far The rise of Grace Mugabe Zimbabwe country profile The print edition of the government-owned daily The Herald appeared on the streets on Wednesday morning with Tuesday's stories which downplayed the importance of the warning by the head of the armed forces Constantino Chiwenga that the military would take over if necessary. The paper's online edition took a few hours to update, and has been carrying coverage of the unfolding events, under the headlineLive and developing: No Military Takeover in Zim,external. Apart from carrying the military statement the paper said: ""The situation in Harare's central business district is calm with people going about their business."" Social media users have been trying to make up for the lack of news by posting their own observations and pictures of street scenes in the capital Harare, including some of troops and police being made to sit in a line outside parliament and people going about their daily lives. Many have dismissed suggestions by the military that their actions don't amount to a coup. Maj Gen Sibusiso Moyo read out a statement on national TV early on Wednesday Using the Twitter hashtag #ZimbabweCoup, many users welcomed the developments. The hashtag had been used more than 13,000 times in the 24 hours up until noon on Wednesday, many of the users appearing to be in the country. One widely shared and liked tweet with a sarcastic overtone read: ""The coup going on in Zimbabwe is the smoothest I've ever seen.. It started like we just wanna talk then went to it's cute you think you [sic] still president."" ""When you see the army commanders take over the state broadcaster airwaves then that's the confirmation it's a COUP. End of an era,"" another tweet read. (bit.ly/2hyoy64) Allow Twitter content?

"Heat waves will cause most weather-related deaths if measures are not taken, the study says Extreme weather could kill up to 152,000 people yearly in Europe by 2100 if nothing is done to curb the effects of climate change, scientists say. The number is 50 times more deaths than reported now, the study in The Lancet Planetary Health journal said. Heat waves would cause 99% of all weather-related deaths, it added, with southern Europe being worst affected. Experts said the findings were worrying but some warned the projections could be overestimated. If nothing is done to cut greenhouse gas emissions and to improve policies to reduce the impact against extreme weather events, thestudy,externalby the European Commission's Joint Research Centre says: Deaths caused by extreme weather could rise from 3,000 a year between 1981 and 2010 to 152,000 between 2071 and 2100 Two in three people in Europe will be affected by disasters by 2100, against a rate of one in 20 at the start of the century There will be a substantial rise in deaths from coastal flooding, from six victims a year at the start of the century to 233 a year by the end of it The research analysed the effects of the seven most dangerous types of weather-related events - heat waves, cold snaps, wildfires, droughts, river and coastal floods and windstorms - in the 28 EU countries as well as Switzerland, Norway and Iceland. Warnings as Europe sizzles in 44C heat What is climate change? The team looked at disaster records from 1981 to 2010 to estimate population vulnerability, and combined this information with predictions of how climate change might progress and how populations might increase and migrate. They assumed a rate of greenhouse gas emissions that would lead to average global warming of 3C (5.4F) by the end of the century from levels in 1990, a pessimistic forecast well above targets set by the Paris Agreement on tackling climate change. Low levels of the Po River near Pavia in northern Italy ""Climate change is one of the biggest global threats to human health of the 21st century, and its peril to society will be increasingly connected to weather-driven hazards,"" said Giovanni Forzieri, one of the authors of the study. ""Unless global warming is curbed as a matter of urgency and appropriate measures are taken, about 350 million Europeans could be exposed to harmful climate extremes on an annual basis by the end of the century."" Flooding near the Bavarian village of Deggendorf in southern Germany in 2013 Fire rages through an area of woodland in Artigues in south-eastern France On Friday, the United States issuedits first written notificationto the UN of its intention to withdraw from the 2015 Paris climate agreement. US President Donald Trump drew international condemnation in June when he first announced his decision, saying the deal would cost millions of American jobs. The Paris Agreementsaw nearly 200 countries agree to keep warming ""well below"" the level of 2C (3.6F) above pre-industrial times and ""endeavour to limit"" them even more, to 1.5C Experts from South Korea's Seoul National University warned that the study's results ""could be overestimated"". ""People are known to adapt and become less vulnerable than previously to extreme weather conditions because of advances in medical technology, air conditioning, and thermal insulation in houses,"" they wrote in a comment piece published in the same journal. Paul Wilkinson, a professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who was not involved in the study, said the findings were ""yet another reminder of the exposures to extreme weather and possible human impacts that might occur if emissions of greenhouse gases continue unabated. ""It adds further weight to the powerful argument for accelerating mitigation actions to protect population health.""

"This video can not be played The painting has been cleaned and restored from the image on the left to the one on the right A 500-year-old painting of Christ believed to have been painted by Leonardo da Vinci has been sold in New York for a record $450m (Â£341m). The painting is known as Salvator Mundi (Saviour of the World). It is the highest auction price for any work of art and brought cheers and applause at the packed Christie's auction room. Leonardo da Vinci died in 1519 and there are fewer than 20 of his paintings in existence. Read aboutLeonardo da Vinci (1452 -1519) 'Mona Lisa nude sketch' found in France Can buying paintings make you rich? Salvator Mundi, believed to have been painted sometime after 1505, is the only work thought to be in private hands. Bidding began at $100m and the final bid for the work was $400m, with fees bringing the full price up to $450.3m. The unidentified buyer was involved in a bidding contest, via telephone, that lasted nearly 20 minutes. Excitement in the auction room rose as the bids by telephone came in The painting shows Christ with one hand raised, the other holding a glass sphere. In 1958 it was sold at auction in London for a mere Â£45. By then the painting was generally reckoned to be the work of a follower of Leonardo and not the work of Leonardo himself. It apparently was part of King Charles I of England's collection in the 1600s and got lost, but was ""rediscovered"" in 2005. Analysis by Arts Editor Will Gompetz $450m for Salvator Mundi is an astonishing price to have realised, given both its condition and authenticity have been questioned. It shows that ultimately art comes down to belief. And there were plenty of bidders last night who were suitably convinced by its Leonardo da Vinci attribution to drive the price up to such stratospheric heights. As yet, the new owner is unknown. Speculation will be rife. Which I will contribute to, by noting the newly opened Louvre Abu Dhabi will have a Leonardo shaped hole in its displays when the decade-long loan deal with the French museums comes to an end. Wherever it ends up, you've got to hand it to Christie's for its masterclass in the art of selling art. Art agents celebrated when the sale was completed In a bold move, without a hint of irony, the painting was sold in its Post-War and Contemporary Art Evening Sale alongside a Jean-Michel Basquiat and Andy Warhol. Why not in the Old Masters Sale? Because that's not where the elephant bucks are. The big money comes into the room nowadays when Pollocks and Twomblys are on the block, and promptly leaves when the Reynolds and Winterhalters arrive. Read more of Will Gompertz's blogs here. This video can not be played Salvator Mundi was discovered hidden under layers of paint Dr Tim Hunter, who is an expert in Old Master and 19th Century art, told the BBC the painting is ""the most important discovery in the 21st Century"". ""It completely smashes the record for the last Old Masters painting to sell - Van Gogh's Sunflowers in 1988. Records get broken from time to time but not in this way. ""Da Vinci painted less than 20 oil paintings and many are unfinished so it's incredibly rare and we love that in art."" Before the auction it was owned by Russian billionaire collector Dmitry E Rybolovlev, who is reported to have bought it in a private sale in May 2013 for $127.5m (Â£98m). The painting has had major cosmetic surgery - its walnut panel base has been described as ""worm-tunnelled"" and at some point it seems to have been split in half - and efforts to restore it resulted in abrasions. BBC arts correspondent Vincent Dowd said that even now attribution to Leonardo is not universally accepted. One critic has described the surface of the painting to be ""inert, varnished, lurid, scrubbed over and repainted so many times that it looks simultaneously new and old"". ""Any private collector who gets suckered into buying this picture and places it in their apartment or storage, it serves them right,"" Jerry Saltz wrote on Vulture.com. But Christie's has insisted the painting is authentic and billed it as ""the greatest artistic rediscovery of the 20th Century"". Georgina Adam, who is an Art Market specialist, told the BBC the price of the piece is ""fuelled by the sheer amount of money that billionaires have."" ""This is the last Leonardo painting you can buy. This isn't as a store of value, it's the ultimate trophy - only one person in the world can own this. ""If you think of the wealth of some billionaires, Bill Gates is worth 87 billion, and I'm not saying it's him, but near to half a billion would not be a colossal chunk out of his income for example."" The auction house has not revealed who purchased the picture, but Hunter speculates it could be a buyer from Asia or even be on the way to the newLouvre in Abu Dhabi. Could the painting be headed for Abu Dhabi's new Louvre Museum? ""It's the sort of painting you can imagine as a star piece in a private collection and as billionaire collectors like to set up their own museums, it could be a good piece for them,"" Hunter said. Adam also thinks the piece could have gone to an Asian market. ""We don't know who bought it, I went to the Louvre in Abu Dhabi and I did wonder whether the Gulf could be responsible. ""People are thinking the Far East, the picture was taken to Hong Kong before it was put up for sale to show to possible buyers there so that is possible.
