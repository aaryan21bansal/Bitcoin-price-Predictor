"This video can not be played Mr Hancock was asked by a reporter whether he was ""hopeless"" - he responded with ""I don't think so"" Dominic Cummings has published expletive-laden messages, apparently from Boris Johnson, in which the PM calls the health secretary ""hopeless"". It is the latest salvo in a bitter war of words between Mr Cummings, the PM's former top aide, and Matt Hancock over the handling of the pandemic. Downing Street did not deny the authenticity of the messages. But the PM's official spokesman insisted Mr Johnson has full confidence in the health secretary. In a 7,000-word blog, Mr Cummings accused Mr Hancock of trying to rewrite history during a select committee hearing last week which was examining how the government has managed various aspects of the crisis. He also took aim at Mr Johnson, claiming he had ""lied about failures"" during the government's initial response to the pandemic. ""If No 10 is prepared to lie so deeply and widely about such vital issues of life and death last year, it cannot be trusted now either on Covid or any other crucial issue of war and peace,"" Mr Cummings wrote. Kuenssberg: Cummings' gradual reveal of what was in that box Hancock defends not bringing in earlier lockdown Fact-checking Matt Hancock's Covid claims Dominic Cummings: The most explosive claims Mr Cummings told MPs three weeks ago that the health secretary had lied to the prime minister about testing hospital patients before they were released into care homes at the start of the pandemic - something firmly denied by Mr Hancock. A source close to Mr Hancock said: ""The health secretary answered many of Mr Cummings' claims at a lengthy session in front of MPs. ""Mr Cummings has still failed to provide evidence to substantiate his claims. ""The health secretary continues to work with the prime minister on the vaccine programme and getting us out of this pandemic as quickly as possible."" Mr Cummings, who was forced out of Downing Street last year, claims the version of events given to the committee by Mr Hancock was ""fiction"". The former aide appears to have kept WhatsApp messages from his time in government and selected six to share with readers of his blog. One of them appears to show an exchange between Mr Johnson and Mr Cummings on 27 March last year. Mr Cummings highlights the ramping up of testing capacity in the US and criticises Mr Hancock for saying he was ""sceptical"" about meeting a target. Mr Johnson purportedly responds: ""Totally [expletive] hopeless."" Mr Cummings also published another private message about the struggle to procure ventilators for Covid-19 patients. ""It's Hancock. He has been hopeless,"" a contact appearing to be Mr Johnson replies on 27 March last year. In another message, on 27 April last year, the prime minister appears to call the situation around personal protective equipment (PPE) ""a disaster"" and alludes to diverting some responsibilities to Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove. ""I can't think of anything except taking Hancock off and putting Gove on,"" Mr Johnson apparently adds. Mr Johnson's official spokesman said he was ""not going to be drawn on these claims"", adding that the prime minister has ""worked very closely with the health secretary and continues to do so"". Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth told Mr Hancock in a Commons debate that he had been ""forever branded Hopeless Hancock by his own leader"". The party's deputy leader Angela Rayner said a public inquiry into the pandemic promised for next spring was now needed ""as quickly as possible"". Mr Cummings suggests in his blog that any inquiry would not ""start for years"" as it was ""designed to punt the tricky parts until after this PM has gone"". This video can not be played ""Tens of thousands of people died who didn't need to die"", Dominic Cummings told MPs ""Unlike other PMs, this one has a clear plan to leave at the latest a couple of years after the next election, he wants to make money and have fun not 'go on and on',"" writes Mr Cummings. But with the Conservatives riding high in the opinion polls, there is no incentive for the party's MPs to move against Mr Johnson, despite the ""systemic incompetence"" surrounding him, he adds. Downing Street rejected the claim that Mr Johnson planned to stand down after the next election, saying: ""The PM has actually been asked this before and said it's utter nonsense, so that still stands."" Let's start with a quick political quiz. Q: Who has the safest job in cabinet? A: Matt Hancock Q: Why? A: Because Dominic Cummings wants him sacked. Boris Johnson's spokesman said the PM had full confidence in the health secretary. He could say little else - as he won't be sacking him at the urging of a disgruntled former aide. If he did, that would suggest that Dominic Cummings was right, about what he thinks were failures over PPE, ventilators and testing, early in the pandemic. And if Mr Hancock goes now, Labour would ask why he wasn't dismissed sooner. Mr Cummings makes serious allegations about the handling of the Covid crisis. But by continually suggesting that Matt Hancock is the very personification of government errors, he may be making it a little too easy for his detractors to portray his interventions as a grudge match. And by denouncing not just the Department of Health and Social Care but the Cabinet Office too, you get the impression that Mr Cummings felt that very few people could come up to his standards. Mr Cummings's own credibility, of course, still remains dented due tolast year's lockdown drive to Durham. But his latest dossier does raise questions of ministers well ahead of the formal inquiry, and provides ammunition to an opposition which has questioned the pace at which the government moved. Giving evidence to MPs last week, Mr Hancock said he had seen no evidence to suggest any medical staff had died because of a lack of PPE. In his blog, Mr Cummings accuses the health secretary of trying to blame NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens, Chancellor Rishi Sunak and the Cabinet Office for last April's ""PPE disaster"". ""The lack of PPE killed NHS and care home staff in March-May,"" he writes. He claims Number 10 and Mr Hancock had ""repeatedly lied about the failures last year"" and accuses them of now trying to ""rewrite history"", with the prime minister ""encouraging ministers to give false accounts to Parliament"". Mr Cummings goes on to criticise Mr Johnson's management style. In one section he contrasts Mr Johnson's approach with that of Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who stood in for the PM when he was in hospital with coronavirus. He said meetings with Mr Raab at the helm were ""less pleasant for everybody but much more productive"". He said this was because Mr Raab ""can chair meetings properly instead of telling rambling stories and jokes"". This video can not be played Five things Health Secretary Matt Hancock told MPs He went on to say that ""as soon as things get 'a bit embarrassing' [Boris Johnson] does the whole 'let's take it offline' shtick before shouting 'forward to victory', doing a thumbs-up and pegging it out of the room before anybody can disagree"". Downing Street said it was ""not going to engage"" with this claim. And on Thursday, Treasury minister Jesse Norman told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I think this is some of the biggest nonsense I've heard. ""The prime minister obviously, as anybody would detect, is a massive supporter of the health secretary. ""He's coming firmly behind him. There can be no question of loss of confidence."" Mr Cummings published the alleged leaks on Substack, an online platform that allows people to charge for newsletters. He has said he plans to charge subscribers for insider information on subjects other than the pandemic.

"Health Secretary Matt Hancock spent more than four hours being questioned by MPs about the government's response to the Covid pandemic. His evidence came two weeks after the prime minister's former adviserDominic Cummings made a series of allegations- we've looked at several of the points Mr Hancock made at the latest hearing. Mr Hancock cited a report from the National Audit Office (NAO) to support this claim. The report says:,external""The NHS provider organisations we spoke to told us that, while they were concerned about the low stocks of PPE, they were always able to get what they needed in time."" But the next sentence says: ""However, this was not the experience reported by many front-line workers."" It cites surveys by bodies such as the Royal College of Nursing (in April and May 2020) showing that a ""significant proportion of participating care workers, doctors and nurses reported having insufficient PPE, even in high-risk settings"". Why some NHS workers are wearing bin bags Dominic Cummings: Five claims fact-checked Matt Hancock: I knew Dominic Cummings wanted PM to sack me It adds that ""government structures were overwhelmed in March 2020"" and that while the government did then set up structures to obtain PPE, that ""it took a long time for it to receive the large volumes of PPE ordered"". There was alsoguidance issued,externalby the government in April 2020 (and since withdrawn) telling front-line staff what they should do to cope with ""acute shortages"" of PPE. Mr Hancock was asked whether failing to test people who were discharged from hospital into care homes early in the first wave, had contributed to the spread of coronavirus there. The 1.6% figure comes froma recently published Public Health England report.,external However, this estimate comes with some major caveats. It is based on positive tests of care home residents but we know that, early on in the pandemic, testing in these settings was limited. So, the analysis misses people who spread the virus but hadn't been tested because they didn't show symptoms, or because there weren't enough tests available. It also misses outbreaks triggered when someone passed it on to a care worker who then did a shift in another home and took the virus there. As Mr Hancock explained, discharges may not have been the main source of care home spread. There were far fewer hospital discharges going into care homes each day than there were staff or visitors, each of whom could have brought in the virus. What did the government do about care homes and coronavirus? But Science and Technology Committee chairman Greg Clark told Mr Hancock it is a ""stretch of the imagination"" to say that the figure is as low as 1.6%, when the data can't properly spot all the seeding events. Mr Hancock was replying to a question about why the government hadn't introduced the lockdown before 23 March 2020. At a government press conference on 9 March 2020, England's Chief Medical Officer Prof Chris Whitty said: ""There is a risk if we go too early people will understandably get fatigued and it will be difficult to sustain this over time."" Buta report from the government's behavioural science advisers,external, SPI-B on 12 March - entitled 'insights on public gatherings' - suggests they thought people would accept restrictions. It notes: ""Expectations of how the Government will react will be set by media reports of public health strategies in other countries. This increases the risk of public concern if interventions that are perceived to be effective are not applied"". In a section on social distancing, the report does say: ""there may be concerns about the sustainability of adherence for difficult behaviours such as entering isolation"". Prof Stephen Reicher, who sits on SPI-B, disputes Mr Hancock's lockdown claim, saying ""it was certainly not the behavioural science advice"". He has pointed to anopen letter from behavioural scientists,externalat the time questioning the evidence for ""behavioural fatigue"". In February 2020, the WHO advised that: ""Travel bans to affected areas or denial of entry to passengers coming from affected areas are usually not effective in preventing the importation of cases, but may have a significant economic and social impact."" This was a recommendation - so non-binding - rather than part of the international health regulations. And a number of countries chose not to follow it. Australia, New Zealand and India almost entirely closed their borders - and it has been noted that they were comparatively well protected during the first wave of Covid. Other countries brought in much more stringent restrictions than the UK, banning entry to all but their citizens or residents, including Singapore, Vietnam, Israel, the Philippines, Taiwan and Argentina. Between January and March 2020, the UK introduced some measures including imposing quarantine on 273 people travelling from Wuhan in China. Others from ""high-risk countries"" including China, Iran and northern Italy were asked to voluntarily isolate for 14 days (though the self-isolation requirements were withdrawn on 13 March). One study found,externalthe virus was introduced to the UK ""well over 1,000 times in early 2020"", with a third of transmission chains brought in from Spain, followed by 29% from France, neither of which faced any restrictions. China accounted for just 0.4% of imported cases. The UKstrengthened its border policyearlier this year. Mr Hancock's claim was interrupted by the former health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, who said that South Korea had not had a lockdown. It's true that South Korea did not implement a national lockdown, but managed to control transmissions by rapidly developing a""test, trace and treat"" system. From 20 February 2020, all symptomatic people were tested, as well as their close contacts (regardless of whether or not they had symptoms). Mass testing was also used in high-risk facilities such as hospitals and care homes, from mid-March. All confirmed cases were either isolated in a hospital, at home, or in a residential treatment centre. South Korea implemented some lockdown measures including moving schools to remote learning in late February 2020 (they gradually reopened in May) and, in a region with a high rate of infections, asking people to refrain from leaving their homes for at least two weeks. South Korea has had a much lower death rate than the UK - 39 confirmeddeaths per one million people,externalcompared with 1,887 in the UK, according to Our World in Data.

"Child protection services in England are too focused on investigating families in crisis and do not provide enough early support, a report says. Anindependent review,externalof council-run children's social care said services to protect vulnerable children were in urgent need of investment and reform. It concluded that with an increasing demand for help, the current system was unsustainable and failing young people. The government, which set up the review, said it was boosting funding. Over the last three months, the review team has heard from more than 1,000 young people, families and staff working in children's services. It found a system under significant strain with an increasing number of families being investigated, more children in care and costs spiralling. Postcode lottery for baby care orders - judge Calls to NSPCC helpline at record high in pandemic Leaving care: 'I fell through the cracks' Josh MacAlister, who chaired the independent review, said: ""If we carry on like this, children's social care will both become more expensive and continue to be inadequate in the support it gives to children and families, so we need to change."" The report said deprivation was a key factor among families needing help. Many of those who asked for support found assessments and investigations added to their stress. The number of inquiries into whether a child is at risk of significant harm - known as section 47 inquiries - has more than doubled since 2010, rising to 201,000 investigations in a year. But the report said 135,000 of those led to no child protection plan. It concluded that concerns about risk have dominated. Official figures also show that in 2019-20 there were more than 80,000 children in the care of local authorities in England, up 24% in a decade. The review team looked at the availability and costs of foster care places and children's homes. It concluded this ""placement market"" was broken and that too often young people ended up being moved a long way from home. ""Too often children are moved far from where they have grown up, are separated from their brothers or sisters, are forced to move schools, and have a revolving door of social workers,"" the report said. ""We are failing to build lifelong loving relationships around these children."" With council budgets squeezed over the last 10 years, spending has increasingly focused on expensive crisis services that local authorities are legally required to provide. That has meant cuts to early help for families. At High Trees Family Centre in Hertfordshire, the county council provides the sort of wide-ranging support that the review team believes is vital. In one place, all local families can access health and care services along with playgroups. Chelsea, mother of one-year-old Darcie, says council-run playgroups are a place to get advice and tips on parenting Chelsea, whose one-year-old daughter Darcie is happily playing with paints, said there should be more play sessions like this. ""It is very important for the mum and the baby,"" she said. ""It means the mum can meet new friends and get advice and tips."" Sammy Lewis works with pregnant mothers and under-ones at the centre. She said that because the centre was open to everyone, it was easy for parents to ask for help and made a real difference to those who were struggling. ""That can help to prevent the need for additional support later down the line and they can feel more happy and confident about family life,"" she said. The independent review will publish its final report, making recommendations for change, next spring. NSPCC chief executive Sir Peter Wanless said the review should seize a ""once-in-a-generation opportunity"" to create ""a comprehensive, properly-funded care system that works for every child and family who needs it, regardless of their background or where they live"". Sammy Lewis, who works with pregnant mothers, says giving parents opportunities to ask for help can prevent issues escalating Mark Russell, chief executive at The Children's Society, said children's social care was ""hamstrung"" by under-investment and bureaucracy, too often intervened only at ""crisis point"", and had ""serious systemic flaws"" including a lack of understanding of threats outside the home. ""Covid has left more children at risk of abuse, exploitation, isolation, mental ill-health and poverty,"" he said, with vulnerable older children being failed as they enter adulthood. The government said it was giving councils an extra Â£16m to target more support earlier in the lives of children already in the care system. It is also planning a pilot scheme to increase educational help. Children and families minister Vicky Ford said: ""For children in care, or those who are known to social care teams, it is absolutely vital we help them to overcome the barriers they can face in education so that they have the best chance to succeed in life."" Tulip Siddiq, Labour's shadow minister for children and early years, said: ""After failing to ban unregulated accommodation for all children in care, there is no evidence that ministers will deliver the reforms that are needed to stop vulnerable young people fall through the cracks."" Directors who run council care services said that while the child protection system in England was one of the safest in the world, the report represented a once-in-a-generation chance to make meaningful and lasting change for children and young people.

"In the US, a 13-year-old boy is vaccinated with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in May A decision to vaccinate all 12 to 17-year-old children against Covid is unlikely to be recommended by UK vaccine experts imminently, the BBC has been told. Certain groups of children may still be offered a Covid jab - but not all. A statement from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) is expected in the coming days. The government will then make a final decision on whether teenagers will be included in the mass rollout. Vaccinating all over-18s with a first dose and two-thirds of adults with a second dose by 19 July is the latest target set by the UK government. There has been much speculation over whether children were going to be included in the UK's vaccination programme against Covid-19 afterregulator the MHRA approved Pfizer's use in 12 to 15-year-olds recently. But the JCVI - the committee of UK vaccine experts which advises the government on the best approach - has not yet made any formal recommendation on the matter. Current advice is that 16 to 18-year-olds can be offered a Pfizer jab if they are in a priority group, or live with someone who has a weakened immune system. The committee may be waiting for more safety data on children who have been vaccinated in other countries, such as the US and Israel, before making its decision. Should all children get a Covid vaccine? How can I get my second jab sooner? Jabs to be compulsory for England care home staff The MHRA's approval was based on trials of the Pfizer vaccine in 2,200 adolescents in the US which showed it was safe and effective, but this is a relatively small number. At the same time, the UK's stock of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines is being prioritised for adults aged 18 to 40 - who are not being offered AstraZeneca - meaning supplies available for children are currently low. However, for the experts there are a whole host of factors to consider, including the benefits and risks for children, as well as other wider ethical issues. Children's risk of severe disease from Covid is tiny, deaths are extremely rare and have only occurred in UK children with profound underlying and life-limiting conditions. The direct benefits to them of vaccination would be low. Some people question whether it's morally right to vaccinate children in the UK, when so many millions of other people in the rest of the world are still unvaccinated. On the other hand, vaccinating children could reduce infections across society, help protect adults and the vulnerable who are most at risk, and keep schools open. ""This is a very finely balanced issue and a difficult decision,"" says Prof Calum Semple, professor of outbreak medicine and child health from the University of Liverpool, who is also a member of the scientific advisory group, Sage. He said he was ""veering towards not vaccinating children"" because of the need to get the vaccine into the arms of more hard-to-reach adults instead. ""The virus is spreading in schools because it's got nowhere else to hide at the moment,"" Prof Semple said, adding that improved ventilation in classrooms was much more of a priority than masks in schools. Vaccinating children would be ""mainly to protect public health and reduce transmission"", he added. It's possible the government is not rushing any decision because it wants to see the impact of vaccinating all adults in the UK on virus cases, which have been rising steadily since the end of May. A target of giving two doses to two-thirds of the UK's adult population was set by the prime minister on Monday - but that is principally the over-40s, who are due to receive the AstraZeneca vaccine. There are concerns there are not enough Pfizer or Moderna vaccines to start vaccinating younger age groups any earlier. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""No decisions have yet been made on whether people aged 12 to 17 should be routinely offered Covid-19 vaccines. ""We will be guided by our expert advisers, and the government has asked the JCVI for its formal recommendation. We will update in due course."" Should all children get a Covid vaccine?

"A ban on landlords evicting firms for unpaid commercial rent is being extended for another nine months. The ban, which stops landlords taking tenants to court for non-payment, was due to end on 30 June. Treasury Secretary Stephen Barclay said the delay in easing lockdown restrictions, announced on Monday, ""present additional challenges"" to business. It is estimated that firms in retail and hospitality are Â£5bn in rent debt. While retailers and hospitality firms welcomed the measures, landlords voiced dismay and again warned that some profitable tenants were abusing the ban to avoid paying rent they can afford. Mr Barclay told the Commons: ""Existing measures will remain in place, including extending the current moratorium to protect commercial tenants from eviction to March 25, 2022,"" Mr Barclay told the Commons. He also announced plans for a binding arbitration scheme to resolve disputes between landlords and commercial tenants. Mr Barclay said the scheme should be in place for when the eviction ban is lifted. He said the measures ""strike the right balance"" between protecting landlords and supporting businesses most in need. But Mr Barclay added: ""To be clear, all tenants should start to pay rent again in accordance with the terms of their lease or as otherwise agreed with their landlord as soon as restrictions are removed on their sector if they are not already doing so."" We're in serious trouble, says hospitality sector Firms ask for more help after 'haemorrhaging cash' Thousands of companies, especially in the hospitality sector, are still unable to trade normally, among them nightclubs and leisure firms. In April last year the government blocked legal attempts to evict shops, restaurants and other businesses that had stopped paying rent, as part of emergency measures to soften the economic impact of the pandemic. Mr Barclay told the Commons his measures ""strike the right balance"". Hospitality leaders had called for an extension of the moratorium and for more financial support from the government. On Monday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said plans to remove remaining pandemic restrictions on 21 June have been pushed back to 19 July amid concerns over the spread of the Delta variant, which was first identified in India. Last week, the chief executives of trade groups UK Hospitality and British Retail Consortium (BRC) told MPs that both sectors have accrued a combined Â£5bn in rent debt. Data for the first quarter of 2021 shows that only 74% of rent was collected by landlords 60 days following the end of the period after tenants were battered by the pandemic. Hospitality, leisure and retail operators have also benefited from a business rates holiday since the start of the crisis. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, many of whose members have felt lockdown most acutely, said the extension comes ""in the nick of time"". She said: ""Just as retailers feared a wave of legal action by landlords, the government has stepped in to offer both landlords and tenants more time to negotiate. Retailers need time to trade their way out of debt; this announcement does exactly that."" The Institute of Directors (IoD) also said firms across the country would welcome the extension, but the Treasury could have gone further. Dr Roger Barker, the IoD's director of policy, said: ""This is only one element of the cliff edge that we have been calling on government to address. ""At the end of this month businesses will still face the tapering off of furlough and business rates relief, and the suspension of wrongful trading liability. The government must hold its nerve and push out its business support measures until the job is properly done."" However, landlords were critical of the measures, with Melanie Leech, chief executive of the British Property Federation, saying: ""The government has failed to recognise that commercial property owners are essential to the health of our town centres - to creating economic growth, jobs and opportunity."" She said the majority of property owners had already reached agreement with their tenants on rent, and millions of pounds have been provided to the most vulnerable tenants in the sectors most impacted by Covid-19. ""That support will continue in light of the delay in the recovery roadmap for those businesses that need it,"" Ms Leach said. ""Another blanket extension to the moratoriums will provide further opportunity for those well-capitalised businesses who can afford to pay rent, but are refusing to do so, to continue their abuse of government and property owners' support and will cast a long shadow over future investment to build back better,"" she said. The ban on tenant evictions was just one of the government support measures that is due to start wearing off on 1 July. A business rate holiday will end with firms asked to pay 33% of their normal bill - rising to 100% by next March, while government contributions to furloughed staff wages will drop by 10% with employers making up the difference. Extending these two measures would be very expensive for the government - extending an eviction ban costs it nothing - leaving the bomb in the lap of the landlord. The government insisted the extension to March would allow new legislation to be drafted to create an arbitration system to resolve disputes between landlords and tenants. Landlords big and small point out that they will have received no income from anyone who didn't want to pay (even if they could) for two years by next March. Support for them has largely come in the form of forbearance from their own banks whose patience may begin to run out. Many also point out that the process of investment and repurposing commercial business premises for a post pandemic age will fall to them. While many businesses will breathe a sigh of relief that landlord's knock at the door can be ignored for another nine months, someone will be left holding a rent arrears bomb - and the government is keen it's not them.

"This video can not be played Paul Pogba removes a beer bottle in news conference First it was Cristiano Ronaldo and now it's Paul Pogba. The day after Ronaldo made headlines by removing two bottles of Coca-Cola at a news conference and then encouraging people to drink ""agua!"" (water) instead, Pogba has gone viral for removing a bottle of Heineken beer. The 28-year-old Frenchman, who is a practising Muslim, made no comment on the matter - just discreetly moved the non-alcoholic beer and placed it below the table during a post-match press conference. It came after he played a starring role in France's 1-0 Group F victory over Germany at Euro 2020 and was awarded the Heineken 'star of the match'. It is understood Uefa does not see the players' actions as an issue, despite the incidents involving two of their high-profile sponsors. The market value of the American drinks giant lost around $4bn after Ronaldo's actions. The firm, which is worth, almost $240bn, shrugged off the impact. ""Everyone is entitled to their drink preferences,"" said Coca-Cola in a short statement, adding that each individual has different ""tastes and needs"". Allow Twitter content?

"Child protection services in England are too focused on investigating families in crisis and do not provide enough early support, a report says. Anindependent review,externalof council-run children's social care said services to protect vulnerable children were in urgent need of investment and reform. It concluded that with an increasing demand for help, the current system was unsustainable and failing young people. The government, which set up the review, said it was boosting funding. Over the last three months, the review team has heard from more than 1,000 young people, families and staff working in children's services. It found a system under significant strain with an increasing number of families being investigated, more children in care and costs spiralling. Postcode lottery for baby care orders - judge Calls to NSPCC helpline at record high in pandemic Leaving care: 'I fell through the cracks' Josh MacAlister, who chaired the independent review, said: ""If we carry on like this, children's social care will both become more expensive and continue to be inadequate in the support it gives to children and families, so we need to change."" The report said deprivation was a key factor among families needing help. Many of those who asked for support found assessments and investigations added to their stress. The number of inquiries into whether a child is at risk of significant harm - known as section 47 inquiries - has more than doubled since 2010, rising to 201,000 investigations in a year. But the report said 135,000 of those led to no child protection plan. It concluded that concerns about risk have dominated. Official figures also show that in 2019-20 there were more than 80,000 children in the care of local authorities in England, up 24% in a decade. The review team looked at the availability and costs of foster care places and children's homes. It concluded this ""placement market"" was broken and that too often young people ended up being moved a long way from home. ""Too often children are moved far from where they have grown up, are separated from their brothers or sisters, are forced to move schools, and have a revolving door of social workers,"" the report said. ""We are failing to build lifelong loving relationships around these children."" With council budgets squeezed over the last 10 years, spending has increasingly focused on expensive crisis services that local authorities are legally required to provide. That has meant cuts to early help for families. At High Trees Family Centre in Hertfordshire, the county council provides the sort of wide-ranging support that the review team believes is vital. In one place, all local families can access health and care services along with playgroups. Chelsea, mother of one-year-old Darcie, says council-run playgroups are a place to get advice and tips on parenting Chelsea, whose one-year-old daughter Darcie is happily playing with paints, said there should be more play sessions like this. ""It is very important for the mum and the baby,"" she said. ""It means the mum can meet new friends and get advice and tips."" Sammy Lewis works with pregnant mothers and under-ones at the centre. She said that because the centre was open to everyone, it was easy for parents to ask for help and made a real difference to those who were struggling. ""That can help to prevent the need for additional support later down the line and they can feel more happy and confident about family life,"" she said. The independent review will publish its final report, making recommendations for change, next spring. NSPCC chief executive Sir Peter Wanless said the review should seize a ""once-in-a-generation opportunity"" to create ""a comprehensive, properly-funded care system that works for every child and family who needs it, regardless of their background or where they live"". Sammy Lewis, who works with pregnant mothers, says giving parents opportunities to ask for help can prevent issues escalating Mark Russell, chief executive at The Children's Society, said children's social care was ""hamstrung"" by under-investment and bureaucracy, too often intervened only at ""crisis point"", and had ""serious systemic flaws"" including a lack of understanding of threats outside the home. ""Covid has left more children at risk of abuse, exploitation, isolation, mental ill-health and poverty,"" he said, with vulnerable older children being failed as they enter adulthood. The government said it was giving councils an extra Â£16m to target more support earlier in the lives of children already in the care system. It is also planning a pilot scheme to increase educational help. Children and families minister Vicky Ford said: ""For children in care, or those who are known to social care teams, it is absolutely vital we help them to overcome the barriers they can face in education so that they have the best chance to succeed in life."" Tulip Siddiq, Labour's shadow minister for children and early years, said: ""After failing to ban unregulated accommodation for all children in care, there is no evidence that ministers will deliver the reforms that are needed to stop vulnerable young people fall through the cracks."" Directors who run council care services said that while the child protection system in England was one of the safest in the world, the report represented a once-in-a-generation chance to make meaningful and lasting change for children and young people.

"Ryanair and the owner of Manchester, London Stansted and East Midlands airports have launched a legal challenge against the government over the travel traffic light system. They are calling for more transparency about how the government decides which countries qualify for the green list of safe places to visit amid the pandemic. EasyJet, Tui and IAG, the owner of British Airways, have backed the case. Ministers say the system ""cautiously manages the risk of new variants"". Thetraffic light system,externalrates countries green, amber or red based on their Covid risk. Travellers to countries rated green will not need to isolate on their return, but they will need to take a Covid test before and after their trip. Arrivals from amber countries will need to quarantine, while red-list countries have the strictest rules, with only UK or Irish nationals, or UK residents, allowed to return - and they must pay for a 10-day stay in a government quarantine hotel. Where can you go on holiday abroad? What's happening with foreign travel? Travel industry anger as Germans flock to Majorca The challenge by Ryanair and Manchester Airports Group (MAG) has been put together after huge frustration within the travel industry at the inclusion of Portugal on the green list in mid-May and then its sudden removal a few weeks later. IAG, the owner of British Airways, has told the BBC it intends to join the case as an ""interested party"". One airline in support said: ""We have been asking for more transparency for some time now and so we share the serious concerns being raised by MAG concerning the lack of transparency around government decision making."" On top of this, the travel industry believes the Balearic and Greek Islands should have been included on the green list of countries last month when health data was analysed. In a separate development, thebosses of Jet2 and EasyJet Holidayshave told the BBC they do not understand why low infection destinations like Mallorca were left off the green list in the last review and questioned how government decisions are made. The boss of Ryanair, Michael O'Leary, wants Boris Johnson to explain the scientific basis behind the system which he says the government ""seems to make up"" as it goes along. Further signatories to the challenge are set to be revealed on Thursday. They are demanding a fast response as the crucial summer season edges closer. The government said at the time that moving Portugal from the green to amber list was necessary because of an increase in infection rates in the country, and the emergence of the ""Nepal variant"", a mutation of the Delta version of the virus first detected in India. There were concerns that vaccines would not work as well on this particular mutation. The move meant that some British holidaymakers had to cut short their holidays anddash back from Portugal on extra flightsput on by airlines before the country came off the green travel list in early June. Travellers the BBC spoke to said it cost them hundreds of pounds to book new flights to get home before the deadline. Travel bosses are concerned the damage of these sudden reversals will continue to erode the confidence of the British travelling public.

But epidemiologists worry that mass travel before more people are fully vaccinated, both in the UK and at holiday destinations, will allow the virus to spread more rapidly. And if Covid cases spiral suddenly on holiday islands, it is not clear if healthcare systems there are in a position to manage their care.

"Wales' education watchdog will hold a review into sexual harassment in schools after 91 were named on a site for reporting allegations of abuse. Education minister Jeremy Miles has asked Estyn to examine the culture in schools. He said he was ""deeply concerned"" about the recent reports and that the schools named will be offered support. It comes after a report found sexual harassment had become""normalised"" in schools in England. Ofsted said that some girls can be contacted by up to 11 boys a night asking for nude images. Ninety schools in Wales named on harassment site Girls asked for nudes by 11 boys a night - Ofsted NSPCC abuse helpline 'takes hundreds of calls' Mr Miles had faced calls from the Welsh Conservatives for a Wales-only review after Everyone's Invited, which has attracted more than 16,000 posts, listed 91 schools in Wales. It publishes anonymous allegations which mostly refer to sexual harassment carried out against young women by young men at their school or university. Ofsted said pupils were put under pressure to share sexual images of themselves In a statement for Senedd members Mr Miles said: ""I am deeply concerned by recent reports of sexual harassment and abuse in schools. ""Any form of sexual harassment or abuse is totally unacceptable and should not be tolerated. All education settings have a legal duty to ensure that children and young people are shown respect and have access to a learning environment in which they feel comfortable and safe."" He said he will be ""requesting Estyn to conduct a review into culture and processes in schools to help protect and support young people better"". ""While the findings of that review will play an important role in supporting settings and informing Welsh Government policy, I recognise that we cannot await the outcome of that review before we act."" New training will be made available on incidents of sharing nudes in schools, while the Welsh government will review the relationships and sexuality education (RSE) resources made available to schools. Conservative education spokeswoman Laura Anne Jones said some most schools ""take their safeguarding responsibilities very seriously"" and some were taking action already. ""However, as so much guidance has already been available for schools, parents and young people, it's vital that any new advice actually has the impact we need it to have, in order to protect our young people from harm,"" she said. ""It's also crucial that Wales' higher education establishments are not forgotten as part of this work, and today I called on the minister to make sure he engages with them too to ensure students are able to focus on their studies without fear of abuse.""

"The hospitality industry is warning of the potential of ""another lost summer"" as Scottish ministers prepare to delay easing coronavirus restrictions. Nicola Sturgeon said on Tuesday that moving Scotland to level zero was likely to be pushed back three weeks. It means restrictions on bars, cafes, restaurants and hotels could be in place until the middle of July. The first minister told MSPs the delay would ensure more people could be vaccinated. Covid cases are continuing to rise in Scotland, where the infection rate is five times higher than it was in early May. Ms Sturgeon's statement came afterPrime Minister Boris Johnson announced on Monday that plans to lift restrictions in Englandwould be delayed by four weeks until 19 July. Scottish lockdown easing to be delayed until July How is Covid case rise affecting patient levels? What Covid rules are changing, and when? The Scottish Licensed Trade Association said the industry was now at ""breaking point"" and they called for more financial assistance for businesses. Its managing director, Colin Wilkinson, said: ""There needs to be an extension to the current support schemes available such as furlough, VAT reduction, deferral of loan repayments and so on. ""Our pubs and bars have already invested millions to provide a safe environment as we all learn to live with this virus and we need to be able to open without restrictions as soon as we can."" Mr Wilkinson said most hospitality businesses were continuing to operate at loss and racking up further debt. They have increased staff costs as they have to provide table service, but fewer tables - and customers - because of social distancing rules. But the situation is even worse for nightclubs, which would not even be allowed to open under level zero rules. ""This is a never-ending hell for hospitality workers and the businesses that employ them, especially those in the music and night-time sectors,"" said Stephen Montgomery, of the Scottish Hospitality Group. He asked the Scottish government to ""tweak the tiers"" so businesses could operate safely but viably. ""The government has shown that it can be flexible and understanding when it wants to, as we've seenwith the Euros and the fan zone,"" he added. ""All we're asking is for hospitality to be shown the same consideration."" He called on ministers to ""get out from behind their desks"" to understand how their policy decisions affect businesses, and to provide ""proper financial support"". It was echoed by the Federation of Small Businesses in Scotland, which said state support should be ""proportionate to the scale of the restrictions"". From next month,employers will have to contribute more to the wages of furloughed employeesahead of the scheme winding up at the end of September. Ahead of that, Finance Secretary Kate Forbes and her counterparts in Wales and Northern Ireland have written to the Chancellor of the Exchequer asking for an urgent meeting. They want to discuss the financial recovery from the pandemic, including the furlough scheme. Thousands of supporters have been allowed to gather in a Fan Zone in Glasgow to watch Euro 2020 matches Aformal decision on what level each area of Scotland will be in will not take place until next week, but Ms Sturgeon said on Tuesday it was ""reasonable to indicate now that I think it unlikely that any part of the country will move down a level"" as planned. It means the country's mainland council areas will remain in either level one or level two, although many island communities including Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles are already in level zero. Ms Sturgeon said that ""we need to buy sufficient time for vaccination to get ahead and stay ahead of the virus, and that is the reason for caution at this juncture"". She also said that a review of physical distancing rules would be published next week, along with a report on what life could look like once Scotland moves beyond level zero. Trade minister Ivan McKee said the Scottish government was trying to make the situation as ""painless as possible in this very difficult time for businesses"". He told theBBC's Good Morning Scotlandprogramme: ""We'll watch the data closely and, based on the direction the virus takes, then we're able to ascertain what measures could be taken. ""There's no point in loosening up too early and then we see a further spike in cases and hospitalisations. We've been here before [and] we don't want to see a third wave of that magnitude."" The Scottish Chambers of Commerce's chief executive Liz Cameron said the latest developments would be ""frustrating and painful"" for many Scottish businesses. She added: ""Any delay must be used to expand the vaccine rollout and deliver the crucial second doses that will move us out of lockdown restrictions faster.""

"A ban on landlords evicting firms for unpaid commercial rent is being extended for another nine months. The ban, which stops landlords taking tenants to court for non-payment, was due to end on 30 June. Treasury Secretary Stephen Barclay said the delay in easing lockdown restrictions, announced on Monday, ""present additional challenges"" to business. It is estimated that firms in retail and hospitality are Â£5bn in rent debt. While retailers and hospitality firms welcomed the measures, landlords voiced dismay and again warned that some profitable tenants were abusing the ban to avoid paying rent they can afford. Mr Barclay told the Commons: ""Existing measures will remain in place, including extending the current moratorium to protect commercial tenants from eviction to March 25, 2022,"" Mr Barclay told the Commons. He also announced plans for a binding arbitration scheme to resolve disputes between landlords and commercial tenants. Mr Barclay said the scheme should be in place for when the eviction ban is lifted. He said the measures ""strike the right balance"" between protecting landlords and supporting businesses most in need. But Mr Barclay added: ""To be clear, all tenants should start to pay rent again in accordance with the terms of their lease or as otherwise agreed with their landlord as soon as restrictions are removed on their sector if they are not already doing so."" We're in serious trouble, says hospitality sector Firms ask for more help after 'haemorrhaging cash' Thousands of companies, especially in the hospitality sector, are still unable to trade normally, among them nightclubs and leisure firms. In April last year the government blocked legal attempts to evict shops, restaurants and other businesses that had stopped paying rent, as part of emergency measures to soften the economic impact of the pandemic. Mr Barclay told the Commons his measures ""strike the right balance"". Hospitality leaders had called for an extension of the moratorium and for more financial support from the government. On Monday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said plans to remove remaining pandemic restrictions on 21 June have been pushed back to 19 July amid concerns over the spread of the Delta variant, which was first identified in India. Last week, the chief executives of trade groups UK Hospitality and British Retail Consortium (BRC) told MPs that both sectors have accrued a combined Â£5bn in rent debt. Data for the first quarter of 2021 shows that only 74% of rent was collected by landlords 60 days following the end of the period after tenants were battered by the pandemic. Hospitality, leisure and retail operators have also benefited from a business rates holiday since the start of the crisis. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, many of whose members have felt lockdown most acutely, said the extension comes ""in the nick of time"". She said: ""Just as retailers feared a wave of legal action by landlords, the government has stepped in to offer both landlords and tenants more time to negotiate. Retailers need time to trade their way out of debt; this announcement does exactly that."" The Institute of Directors (IoD) also said firms across the country would welcome the extension, but the Treasury could have gone further. Dr Roger Barker, the IoD's director of policy, said: ""This is only one element of the cliff edge that we have been calling on government to address. ""At the end of this month businesses will still face the tapering off of furlough and business rates relief, and the suspension of wrongful trading liability. The government must hold its nerve and push out its business support measures until the job is properly done."" However, landlords were critical of the measures, with Melanie Leech, chief executive of the British Property Federation, saying: ""The government has failed to recognise that commercial property owners are essential to the health of our town centres - to creating economic growth, jobs and opportunity."" She said the majority of property owners had already reached agreement with their tenants on rent, and millions of pounds have been provided to the most vulnerable tenants in the sectors most impacted by Covid-19. ""That support will continue in light of the delay in the recovery roadmap for those businesses that need it,"" Ms Leach said. ""Another blanket extension to the moratoriums will provide further opportunity for those well-capitalised businesses who can afford to pay rent, but are refusing to do so, to continue their abuse of government and property owners' support and will cast a long shadow over future investment to build back better,"" she said. The ban on tenant evictions was just one of the government support measures that is due to start wearing off on 1 July. A business rate holiday will end with firms asked to pay 33% of their normal bill - rising to 100% by next March, while government contributions to furloughed staff wages will drop by 10% with employers making up the difference. Extending these two measures would be very expensive for the government - extending an eviction ban costs it nothing - leaving the bomb in the lap of the landlord. The government insisted the extension to March would allow new legislation to be drafted to create an arbitration system to resolve disputes between landlords and tenants. Landlords big and small point out that they will have received no income from anyone who didn't want to pay (even if they could) for two years by next March. Support for them has largely come in the form of forbearance from their own banks whose patience may begin to run out. Many also point out that the process of investment and repurposing commercial business premises for a post pandemic age will fall to them. While many businesses will breathe a sigh of relief that landlord's knock at the door can be ignored for another nine months, someone will be left holding a rent arrears bomb - and the government is keen it's not them.

"This video can not be played Will Wales see more sun and less snow in future? Lives and livelihoods are at risk if Wales does not do more to prepare for a hotter, wetter future, government advisers say. The Climate Change Committee (CCC) said current plans to protect people, infrastructure and wildlife ""will not be sufficient"". It comes despite warnings in a series of reports by the CCC since 2011. The Welsh government said climate change was ""at the heart"" of its decision making. Of the 61 risks identified by the CCC in its latest assessment of the impact of climate change in the UK, ""more action"" is needed in Wales to address 32 of them. Twenty six of the risks have increased in urgency sincethe last report in 2016. They include threats to the viability of coastal communities from sea level rise, flooding and erosion, people's health from overheating in their homes, roads and railways from extreme weather and lightning, and wildlife across land and sea. It is getting warmer and sunnier - but wetter and wilder too. Since the mid 1970s Wales has seen an increase in average annual temperatures of 0.9C, with a 6.1% rise in average sunshine hours. The report forecasts a rise of between 1.3 and 2.3C in annual temperatures here by the 2080s, depending on how successful the world is at cutting out the gases driving climate change. It means hotter, drier summers with more extreme heatwaves - something we are already starting to experience. Rainfall is expected to decrease in summer by approximately 15% by the 2050s and by up to 26% by the 2080s - leading to potential droughts. By contrast, we are likely to have much wetter winters, exacerbating flooding issues. Sea levels are also rising - with predictions in the report they could be between 22 (8.6in) and 28cm (11in) higher in Cardiff by the 2050s and between 43 (17in) and 76cm (30in) by the 2080s - once again depending on global efforts. Disruption to transport and IT infrastructure from fluctuating temperatures, wildfires and flooding could potentially impact ""hundreds of thousands of people annually"". The report warns of ""cascading risks"" if power supplies are affected too, given Wales, like the rest of the UK, will be heavily reliant on electricity for everything from heating to transport. Heat-related deaths in Wales could increase from 2.4 per 100,000 people a year in 2016 to 6.5 per 100,000 by the 2050s. The report says measures to prevent overheating in people's homes is a ""major policy gap"" across all UK nations. On sea level rise, there is ""little evidence"" Welsh government and local authorities are taking a strategic approach to identifying communities that may be at risk of losing homes and amenities and supporting them. But the report does point toFairbourne in Gwyneddas an example for the rest of the UK of where a plan is being put in place with the community. This video can not be played Speaking in 2019, Fairbourne residents said they could become ""climate change refugees"" Just over 10,000 properties are at risk from coastal flooding in Wales at present, this could increase ""by 260%"" by the 2080s - while 2,126 properties are likely to be at risk of coastal erosion where defences are not maintained. And 148,000 people live in areas of significant flood risk from rivers, the sea and surface water. While acknowledging ""considerable advances"" have been made on managing flood risk since 2016, the CCC concluded more action was needed given the scale of the threat - including tackling continued development on flood plains. Pontypridd's popular lido at Ynysangharad Park was flooded during Storm Dennis The problems that could be caused by landslides and subsidence in ex mining areas is a particular concern for Welsh communities, it said. It said ""urgent action"" is needed to enhance surveillance of tree disease in Wales, with climate change thought to be contributing to a rise in the spread of pests and pathogens such as ash dieback. We could face big problems if trees, peatlands and other natural habitats are allowed to suffer as they are a vital way of soaking up carbon dioxide and avoiding even worse effects from global warming. ""We're seeing the climate change now, it's no longer a future issue,"" said Kathryn Brown, the CCC's head of adaptation. ""Welsh government will need to look at all of the risks and think carefully about how to enhance its policies but also take urgent action in the next two years in the priority areas."" Prof Andrew Flynn who specialises on climate adaptation at Cardiff University's school of geography and planning said it was an issue which ""tends to get left behind"". ""So much of the focus is on how can we reduce those carbon emissions - which is obviously hugely important,"" he said. Climate went down agenda after 2008 crash - ex-FM Scientists plant crops to remove greenhouse gases New targets on Wales' climate change gases UK peat emissions could cancel forest benefits ""But adapting to climate change is equally worthy of attention and matters a lot to people in the communities where they live."" Prof Flynn said the Welsh government had a tradition of being ""innovative"" on the environment and sustainability which meant it had a ""good base to build on"". How communities are told about and consulted on the threats and opportunities climate change might pose in their areas should be one priority, he said. ""This is not simply a case of developing new policies - it's about recognising the scale of the challenge that we face."" Wales' climate change minister has welcomed the report from the CCC and said environment and climate change was ""at the heart of our decision making"". ""To help limit further climate change we need to do more to tackle emissions in the next 10 years than we have in the last 30,"" said Julie James MS. The minister said its plan for climate change was already in the second year of being delivered, and the new advice ""will enable us to review and update our actions in light of the latest science"". Welsh Conservative spokeswoman on climate change Janet Finch-Saunders called the report ""alarming"". ""Two years ago, in the wave of publicity driven by the antics of Extinction Rebellion, Labour declared a 'climate change emergency', but have done very little since to tackle the crisis,"" she said. ""Twenty-six of the risks have increased in urgency since the last report by the CCC, and if the current Welsh government fails to act to slow climate change, it is our children, grandchildren and future generations who will be forced to pay the price.""

"Covid vaccinations are to become compulsory for staff at care homes in England, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said. Mr Hancock said it was a ""sensible and reasonable step"" and he would consult on extending it to the NHS. There are no plans to extend mandatory vaccinations beyond health and care workers, he said. Workers will have 16 weeks to get both jabs from the time regulations are approved by Parliament. If they do not, they face being redeployed away from front-line care or potentially losing their job. Mr Hancock told the House of Commons that the ""vast majority of staff in care homes"" were vaccinated, but not all of them. ""We know that the vaccine not only protects you but protects those around you,"" he said, adding that compulsory vaccinations in care homes and hospitals would save lives. What happened to care homes early in the pandemic? How many people have been vaccinated so far? When will I get the vaccine? Care organisations have warned that compulsory vaccinations could cause significant difficulties in a sector that already struggles to recruit enough people. The government, however, is believed to have considerable concerns about low take-up of the vaccine in some areas, including London. A Whitehall source told the BBC that guidance to doctors that they should take the Hepatitis B vaccine suggested there is a precedent for mandatory vaccination. The requirement will also apply to volunteers at care homes and those visiting for other work, such as healthcare workers, tradespeople, hairdressers and beauticians. Workers who can prove they are medically exempt from getting the vaccine will not be affected. There will be also be exemptions for visiting family and friends, under-18s, emergency services and people undertaking urgent maintenance work. Governments inScotland, Wales andNorthern Irelandhave said they have no plans to make Covid jabs mandatory for care home staff. It comes as the UK recorded a further 9,055 confirmed Covid cases and nine more deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Another 190,033 people received a first dose of the vaccine on Tuesday, bringing the total with at least one dose to more than 42 million - or 79.8% of adults. More than 30 million people - 57.8% of adults - have had both doses after a further 230,666 second jabs were given out. The move to mandatory vaccinations for care home staff in England follows a consultation by the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC), launched in April, two months after the government said it had met its target of offering all front-line care workers a first dose of a vaccine by mid-February. At the time, it said 47% of English care homes for older people had more than a fifth of staff yet to take up the vaccine, despite staff at all eligible care homes having been offered vaccines, with the vast majority of homes having had repeat visits by vaccine teams. Dr Susan Hopkins, strategic response director for Covid-19 at Public Health England, said there are ""pros and cons to any debate on mandatory vaccination"", with the ""pro"" being that those caring for the most vulnerable in care homes would be vaccinated, thus minimising the risks to residents. She said a possible downside could be that ""people may vote with their feet, and not want to have the vaccine, and therefore not work in a care home, and that could lead to staff supply issues in care homes"". Dr Hopkins said there had been ""excellent uptake"" of the vaccine, adding: ""I think where people are hesitant, we need to work harder to make them understand why the vaccines work."" This video can not be played Ros Atkins on: What are the Delta variant symptoms? The British Medical Association, which represents doctors, warned compulsion was ""a blunt instrument that carries its own risks"". It added: ""While some healthcare workers are already required to be immunised against certain conditions to work in certain areas, any specific proposal for the compulsory requirement for all staff to be vaccinated against Covid-19 would raise new ethical and legal implications."" Mike Padgham, chairman of the Independent Care Group (ICG) which represents care homes in Yorkshire, said he was disappointed by the decision and concerned it could cause legal disputes for providers. He told the Today programme: ""People should be vaccinated, every member of staff should take up the vaccine, but I just think persuasion rather than coercion or compulsion is the way to deal with it."" Susan Lord, whose mother lives in a care home in Leeds, said whilst it was ""great"" staff in the home had been vaccinated, she was ""concerned"" by the idea of mandatory jabs targeted solely at care workers. Susan Lord, whose mother is in a care home, said it seemed ""harsh"" to threaten the jobs of social care staff Ms Lord, from High Wycombe, told BBC News: ""If someone has been working in care for years and isn't able to have the vaccine or has strong objections to having it, it seems a little bit unfair that they're going to lose their job"". She said most care home staff only work in one place and are regularly tested, so it seems ""a little bit harsh"". Mr Padgham said the sector already had a ""recruitment crisis"", saying: ""We're frightened that this is going to put more people off coming into social care and that's going to be difficult."" Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK said: ""Every care home resident would want to be cared for by someone who had been vaccinated, but if a compulsory approach leads to some care workers quitting it will make existing chronic staff shortages even worse."" ""With or without mandatory vaccination,"" she said an approach of ""peer-to-peer persuasion"" should be taken in care homes, ""because this approach has been found to work well"". Low uptake among care home staff was a big concern when the vaccine programme was launched - similar issues are seen with the annual flu jab. Efforts have been made to convince staff of the need to get vaccinated - there have been advertising campaigns targeting them, webinars held by health leaders and repeat visits made to homes by vaccination teams. There are plenty of places where there has been good uptake. But there are also significant numbers of places where fewer than 80% of staff have been vaccinated - the threshold deemed essential to keep the virus out if 90% of residents are also vaccinated. Those working in the sector say there are a variety of reasons staff have cited - cultural reasons and concerns about safety. One common issue has been (unfounded) worries about its impact on fertility as the workforce is young and predominantly female. This move raises lots of concerns from individual rights to its potential to force staff out from a sector that is already short of workers. But the counter argument is that the vulnerabilities of residents and the closed environments they live in require drastic action. Kelly Andrews, national care lead of the GMB union and a former care worker told BBC News: ""We should not have forced vaccinations in social care, this is pushing the workforce away from social care in an area that we're already struggling to recruit and retain"". In a survey of about 1,000 of its carers, the GMB said, more than a third indicated they would quit their jobs if vaccines were mandated. In the care sector in Englandthere have been more than 40,000 deaths involving Covid.,external Additional reporting by Joseph Lee. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area?

"Joe Biden gave his assessment of his meeting with Vladimir Putin in Geneva He said the talks were ""positive"" but warned the US would not tolerate interference in US democracy Putin described his talks with the US president as ""constructive"" He said the two sides agreed to return ambassadors after they were withdrawn earlier this year A wide range of topics, from cyber-attacks to Ukraine were discussed, but little in the way of concrete deals The meeting in Geneva was their first since Biden became president and was closely watched All times are GMT (BST-1) Edited by Jessica Murphy, Toby Luckhurst and Paul Kirby Thanks for tuning in to todayâs live coverage of the Biden
and Putin summit. Here are some of the key points from today:  Sophie Williams, David Walker and Holly
Honderich were our writing team today. The live page was edited by Paul Kirby, Toby Luckhurst and Jessica
Murphy. While the presidential plane waited to leave Geneva, President Biden took questions from reporters who were pressing him on what he had achieved during the Putin meeting. ""To be a journalist you have to have a negative world view, it seems,"" Biden said, chiding reporters for ""never"" asking a positive question. Pushed over whether or not he accomplished anything, he responds ""we will see"". Over the audible pleas of the president's team asking reporters to wrap up the questions, Biden continued to speak with them and defend his position with Putin. Biden apologised for being ""short"" and a ""wise guy"" to reporters, who he then called ""the brightest people in the country"". Vladimir Putin's two-decade reign as either president or prime minister of Russia has overlapped with the terms of five US presidents. Here's a look back at his meetings with the four who came before Joe Biden: Bill Clinton, George Bush, Barack Obama and Donald Trump. Putin and Bill Clinton met in 2000 in New York City George W Bush meanwhile met with Putin at his vacation home in 2008 Putin and President Obama shook hands for the cameras at a bilateral meeting at the UN headquarters in New York And President Donald Trump was photographed greeting Putin at the G20 Osaka Summit in 2019 Biden is known for his love of sunglasses President Biden gave his Russian counterpart two gifts at the summit, according to the White House. The first was a crystal sculpture of a US bison - ""one of our nation's most majestic mammals and representative of strength, unity, resilience"", a statement read. He also gave President Putin a pair of sunglasses - ""custom Aviators"". Biden is known for sporting Aviator sunglasses and has been photographed in the iconic shades many times. Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News A ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline in the US caused a surge of panic buying At least in public, the two leaders set out familiar
positions a world-apart. The US says Russia has carried out aggressive
cyber-espionage and sheltered criminalsattacking US infrastructure with ransomware.
But President Putin responded by suggesting most attacks in cyber-space come
from America and elsewhere. The US ambition for this meeting was to set out red lines
and President Biden suggested he did just that - saying he listed 16 sectors of
critical infrastructure that should be off-limits to attacks. He
said heâd also asked Putin how he would feel if Russiaâs oil
infrastructure was disrupted in the way that US fuel supplies were. This was no
threat, merely to make a point, he appeared to be saying. But he also pointed
out that Moscow knows the US has ""significant"" cyber capability - a clear
warning. Perhaps most significantly, Biden said the two
sides agreed to set up a working group to develop specific understandings in
cyber space and  follow up on specific cases. âAre they going to act? We
are going to find out,â he said. So rhetoric, warnings, denials and
red lines were all there as expected - but also the possibility of a route to
some kind of better understanding with the caution that this may or not
work.  In keeping with the two presidents' shared script of a ""cooperative"" meeting today, Putin and Biden have released a joint statement. The two countries have proven they are able to make progress on shared goals ""even in periods of tension"", they said. Russian-American cooperation helps reduce the threat of our own conflicts, and the threat of nuclear war, Putin and Biden said.  After a mostly congenial tone, Biden's post-Putin press conference ended in a flurry of confusion. Putting on his aviator sunglasses and making moves to leave, Biden continued to field questions as he walked off the stage. Journalists probed Biden on what concrete action he had managed to elicit from Putin, pointing to the Russian leader's defensiveness on human rights questions earlier today. Becoming visibly irritated, Biden walked back over to reporters, shaking his head at their questions. Asked why Biden was confident that Putin would change his behaviour after false promises in the past, the US president retorted: ""If you donât understand that, youâre in the wrong business."" Earlier, there was confusion after President Biden nodded when a reporter asked if he trusted President Putin. The White House issued a denial, saying he was ""clearly not responding to any one question, but nodding in acknowledgement to the press generally."" Asked at the news conference again about whether he could trust Putin, Biden said this was ""not about trust"". ""This
is about self interest and verification of self interest,"" he said. He said it was best to wait and see what happened, quoting an old saying. ""The proof of the pudding is in the eating. Weâre going to
know shortly,"" he said. This video can not be played Putin and Biden summit: Ongoing relations about 'mutual self-interest' When asked about restricted political freedoms in Russia, Putin pointed to the 6 January riots at the US Capitol, saying he didn't want that sort of chaos to happen in Russia. Asked about those remarks at his own news conference, Joe Biden laughed and said it was a ""ridiculous comparison"". On one hand, Biden said, you have ""criminals"" trying to take hold of the US Capitol. In Russia, you have people peacefully objecting, people who are not allowed to speak freely, he added. Petr KozlovBBC Russia First thing to point out is that the meeting lasted less
than what was originally announced - less than five hours. Second, just a few
minutes after the end of the negotiations, Vladimir Putin came out to
journalists and made a number of harsh statements - about the situation in
Ukraine, the situation with the opposition in Russia, saying that the actions
of the Russian authorities are no different from the actions of authorities in the US. On the whole, Vladimir Putin's press conference was largely a repetition
of what the Russian president has been saying for many years. The only new
element was perhaps stating that some restoration of diplomatic bodies is
possible, and that an exchange of citizens, convicted and imprisoned in Russia
and the United States, respectively, is possible.  This video can not be played Biden to Putin: I'm not against Russia or anyone else In his first question from reporters, President Biden is asked what he has done to prevent Russian election interference in the future. ""Whether I have stopped [election interference], Putin knows there will be consequences,"" Biden says. Russia is ""desperately trying to maintain its standing"" as a world power, Biden says. Losing this status will be ""the price they pay"" for continued interference. ""They are not able to dictate what happens in the world,"" he says. The same applies if Alexei Navalny dies. The consequences to Russia would be devastating, Biden says. Finishing his opening remarks, Biden said it was ""important to meet in
person so there could be no mistake about"" his intentions. ""I did what I came to do. Number one: identify areas of
practical work our two countries can do to advance our mutual interests and
also benefit the world. Two: Communicate directly, directly, that the US will
respond to actions that impair our vital interests or those of our allies. And
three, to clearly lay out our countryâs priorities and our values so he heard it
straight from me,"" he said. ""And I must tell you the tone of the entire meetings â I guess
it was a total of four hours â was good, positive,"" he said. ""There wasnât any strident
action taken."" Biden, like Putin, addresses cybersecurity early on, saying that the US identified certain cyber infrastructures that are ""off limits"". The US defined 16 such sites, defined as critical infrastructure. Russia agreed in principle, Biden says. But ""principle is one thing, it has to be backed up by practice"".  President Biden starts off with a firm but conciliatory tone. ""Where we have
differences I want President Putin to understand why I say what I say and why I
do what I do,"" Biden says. ""I
told President Putin my agenda is not against Russia or anyone else, itâs for
the American people,"" he said. Human rights ""are who we are"" as Americans, Biden says. They will ""always be on the table"". After President Putin's nearly hour-long press conference, his American counterpart is up now. President Joe Biden has taken the podium and is poised for questions. Vitaliy ShevchenkoBBC Monitoring Russian ambassador Anatoly Antonov will return to Washington
by July, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov has said. ""Mr Antonov is waiting with his bags packed. Since the order
has been received directly from the president, I think Mr Antonov will most
definitely return to Washington by the end of this month,"" Ryabkov told
journalists in Geneva, according to Interfax news agency. He was speaking after President Vladimir Putin told a news
conference after talks with US President Joe Biden that the ambassadors will be
restored. ""We have agreed that this issue has been
resolved,"" Putin said. ""They are returning to the places of
their permanent service. As to when exactly, tomorrow or the day after, that is
a purely technical issue,"" he said. We just heard from President Putin as he addressed journalists for nearly an hour. President Joe Biden should be up next - journalists in Geneva say he could take the stage any moment. Sarah RainsfordBBC Moscow Correspondent Speaking on BBC News Channel. Vladimir Putin was keen to spin a positive line on what happened. He
was quite warm, in fact, in talking about Joe Biden. One thing that stood out was how he said they had spoken eye to eye
for almost two hours. Itâs not every world leader you can do that with in such
detailed talks, he said. These were substantive, important, constructive talks, he stressed,
and there were a few points at which they managed to move the relationship
forward. They agreed to return ambassadors - without ambassadors itâs difficult
to see how you can talk about any kind of diplomatic relationship. There is an
agreement that the foreign ministers will look into the possible release and swap
of high-profile prisoners, both in Russia and the US, and consultations will be
held on strategic security. Vladimir Putin was keen to underline several times that Russia was a
nuclear power. It is an important country, yes its economy is far smaller than
the US, but it is a nuclear power and does matter. And thatâs why Joe Biden, in
Putinâs eyes, came to talk to him. During the press conference, the BBC's Steve Rosenberg asked about Russian ""unpredictability"", which he said the west believes is ""an inherent trait of the
Russian policy."" ""Are you ready to forego instability to improve?"" he asked the Russian President. It's clear that Putin was not a big fan of the question. ""You said the west believes that Russian policy is
unpredictable, well let me reciprocate. The US withdrawal from the ABM treaty
in 2002 was unpredictable. Why would they do that? ""Then disrupt and undermine
the basis of the strategic stability, the INF treaty withdrawal in 2019, is that
what you call stability, the open skies agreement withdrawal, well, is that what
you call stability? Thereâs almost no legs to stand on,"" he said. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.9999999

"MPs will vote later on extending emergency Covid laws in England for another four weeks, amid concern over rising cases England's lockdown was due to end 21 June, but the PM wants it delayed until 19 July - a decision that is expected to be approved by MPs today People in England aged 21 and over can now book their Covid vaccine, the NHS says But vaccinations are unlikely to be offered to 12 to 17-year-olds in the UK in the near future, the BBC understands Covid vaccinations are to become compulsory for staff in care homes for older people in England Boris Johnson called Health Secretary Matt Hancock ""hopeless"" in a text message to Dominic Cummings, the PM's former chief adviser says A ban on landlords evicting firms for unpaid commercial rent is being extended for another nine months UK inflation jumped to 2.1% in the year to May, as the opening up of the economy from lockdown sparked a rise in consumer spending Researchers say they have found another life-saving therapy to treat Covid, which could help one in three of those in hospital with the virus The number of Americans who have died from Covid-19 has reached 600,012 - the most of any nation Edited by Hamish Mackay That's all from us today, thanks for joining. Our live coverage of the pandemic will be back in the morning. Before we head off, here are the main headlines this evening:  Today's coverage was brought to you by Hazel Shearing, Victoria Lindrea, Jen Meierhans, Jack Hunter and Hamish Mackay. Alison RobertsPortugal Correspondent, Lisbon Daily cases in Portugal have reached their highest level in almost two months, with 1,350 new Covid cases - and 6 deaths -  reported in the past 24 hours. It's the highest daily case number since 24 February this year. Of the cases recorded, 68% were in the capital Lisbon and the Tagus Valley region, where the Delta variant is spreading fast. Under new rules, travellers arriving in Portugal from Nepal must now quarantine, along with those from India, South Africa and Brazil. People may only travel from these countries to Portugal for essential reasons, such as work, family or health. The government has said it will review the situation at its weekly cabinet meeting on Thursday. It  follows the UK's decision to remove Portugal from its quarantine-free ""green list"" for travel. The debate about whether to delay the ending of all coronavirus restrictions in England to 19 July is ongoing in the House of Commons. Our live coverage here will be ending soon but you can continue to watch the debate onBBC iPlayerand we will report the outcome of the vote on theBBC News website. The UK has recorded another 9,055 new Covid-19 infections in the last 24 hours - above the seven-day average of 7,888. However, while cases are rising, deaths and hospitalisations remain low. Meanwhile, the number of first vaccination doses given is on the rise as the rate of second doses slows. As well as the revelations about the PM's opinion of his health secretary, former chief adviser Cummings also published messages - dated 27 April 2020 - in which the PM appears to call the situation around personal protective equipment (PPE) ""a disaster"". One message alludes to diverting some responsibilities from Mr Hancock to Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove. ""I can't think of anything except taking Hancock off and putting Gove on,"" Johnson apparently adds. At his appearance last week before the Health and Social Care and Science Committees, Hancock said he had seen no evidence to suggest any medical staff had died because of a lack of PPE. In his blog, Cummings accuses the health secretary of trying to blame NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens, Chancellor Rishi Sunak and the Cabinet Office for last April's ""PPE disaster"". ""The lack of PPE killed NHS and care home staff in March-May,"" he writes. ""The PM is trying to influence officials/advisers to support the re-writing of history and is encouraging ministers to give false accounts to Parliament."" Downing Street has yet to respond to the allegations. As we reported earlier, Dominic Cummings - the PM's former chief adviser - has published expletive-laden messages apparently from Boris Johnson, inwhich Johnson brands the health secretary ""hopeless"". Downing Street has not denied the authenticity of the messages. You can watch Matt Hancock's fleeting response to the assesment below... Allow Twitter content?

Alice EvansNewsbeat Daniela Arguello (right) hasn't seen her family since she moved to London just before the pandemic More and more of us have been getting texts from our GPs (or our mums) to tell us itâs time to book our first Covid vaccine. Appointments in England have now opened up for 21 and 22-year-olds. But some people are feeling a complicated mix of emotions â even guilt â as they book their jab. Daniela Arguello, 25, moved to the UK in January 2020, just weeks before Covid shut down global travel. In Guatemala, where Daniela is from and her family live, the daily figures for new Covid infections are currently at an all-time high. Daniela doubts any of her family will get a first dose this year. Her nan, 81, signed up back in February but has heard nothing back. ""Here we have the NHS and so much access to get care if you get Covid,"" Daniela says. ""They don't even have the capacity to deal with it, let alone have vaccines. ""It's scary and I worry about them all the time. It's sad because if they were living here they already would have been vaccinated at this point."" Read the full story here. Conservative MP Sir Desmond Swayne says he always thought it was wrong for ministers to ""take our freedoms even though they believed they were acting in our best interests in an emergency"". ""But by any measure that emergency has passed and yet freedoms are still withheld and the government will not allow us to assess for ourselves the risk we are prepared to encounter in our ordinary everyday lives. ""The government does not trust the people that it governs,"" he says. Swayne says many members of Sage have been out ""busily underminding public morale"" with one saying ""we must all remain masked and distanced"" forever. He says after the health and economic consequences of coronavirus have been dealth with the government will have set a disastrous president in terms of the future of liberty. We've got more from the debate in the Commons now. Mark Harper, chair of the Covid Recovery Group, says his worry is that there will be a continual extending of restrictions. Health Secretary Matt Hancock denies this is likely, saying eradicating the virus is not possible - and the government is aiming ""to live with Covid, like we do with flu"". The four-week delay is intended to get a second jab into ""a majority"" of over-40s by 19 July and the pause is estimated ""to save thousands of lives"", says Hancock - but he adds that a further pause would not save many more lives. ""I am confident we will not need more than four weeks to get this job done."" Away from the UK, Portugal will be the first country to benefit from the EUâs massive pandemic recovery fund, the blocâs president says. Speaking in Lisbon, Ursula von der Leyen says Portugal was the first country to present its ideas for how to spend its share of the EU's â¬750bn (Â£644bn) fund earmarked to help member states out of the sharp economic downturn caused by Covid-19. Itâs getting â¬16bn (Â£13.7bn) in grants and loans, after a 7% economic slump last year. Ms von der Leyenâs next stop is Madrid, with Spain set to get the second-largest financial handout after Italy. Jonathan Ashworth says lifting restrictions now would be ""akin to throwing petrol on a fire"", confirming that as the shadow health secretary, he will be backing the delay to restrictions for a further four weeks. But he adds ""we shouldn't be here"" - adding that the UK has failed to contain the Delta variant because of slack quarantine measures. He says the health secretary will be forever branded ""Hopeless Hancock"" - following Dominic Cummings' revelations of text messages from the PM earlier - a view which, Mr Ashworth adds, might now be shared by members of the public. Ashworth says the government ""failed to protect our borders"" and he accuses them of giving the Delta variant ""the red carpet"" - reiterating Labour leader's Sir Keir Starmer's attack at PMQs earlier today. A total of72,461,462vaccination doses have now been given in the UK, according to thegovernment's daily figures.,external That's42,021,089first doses and30,440,373second doses. Find out where how the vaccine rollout is progressing across the UKhere. A further nine people have died with coronavirus in the UK, according togovernment's daily figures.,external This takes the total number of people to die in the 28 days following a positive Covid-19 test to 127,926. There were also 9,055 new infections recorded in the last 24 hours. Matt Hancock confirms - as reported earlier by the BBC - that vaccinations will be mandatory for older people's care home workers in England and there will be consultation over whether to do the same for NHS workers and domiciliary carers. He says: ""The vast majority of staff in care homes are already vaccinated but not all and we know that the vaccine not only protects you but it protects those around you. ""And therefore we will be taking forward the measures to ensure the mandation for as a condition of deployment for staff in care homes and we will consult on the same approach in the NHS in order to save lives and protect patients from the disease,"" he says. Hancock says he does not agree with making vaccines compulsory for the whole population but says it is a ""sensible and reasonable step"" for those caring for the most vulnerable. He says there were ""no proposals to go any wider"" than those in domicillary care and the NHS. By 18 June, the NHS says all adults in England will be eligible for their first dose. And by 19 July, all those aged over 50 and the clinically extremely vulnerable will have been offered second doses. Across the rest of the UK:  Our health reporter Philippa Roxby has everything you need to know about vaccineshere. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has opened the debate on whether to delay the easing of coronavirus restrictions He tells MPs the Delta variant has given the virus ""extra legs"" because it spreads more easily. ""And because there's some evidence that the risk of hospitalisation is higher than for the Alpha variant, which was of course previously dominant in this country,"" he says. ""The Delta variant now accounts for 96% of new cases. The number of cases is rising and hospitalisations are starting to rise too - they are up 48% over the past week,"" he says. ""The number of deaths in England is thankfully not rising and remains very low."" He adds: ""We don't yet know the extent to which the link between hospitalisation and deaths has been broken, so we propose to give the NHS a few more crucial weeks to get those remaining jabs into the arms of those who need them."" MPs are now debating whether to extend emergency Covid laws in England for another four weeks, amid concern over rising cases. Boris Johnson says delaying the planned lifting of restrictions until 19 July will give the NHS ""a few more crucial weeks"" to get people vaccinated. Labour accuses ministers of letting the Delta variant in by not toughening rules on travel from India sooner. But it is likely to support delaying an end to lockdown, meaning the government is expected to win the vote. We will let you know when it goes to a vote.Here's all the background. Young people in Wales should be given free access to gyms and leisure centres, according to proposals being put forward by the Welsh Conservatives. They have called for measures to boost participation in sport with Covid having a detrimental impact ""at all levels"". Gyms, leisure centres and fitness facilities in Wales were forced to close for much of the pandemic, but have been allowed to reopen since 3 May. The Welsh Conservatives spokesperson for sport, Tom Giffard, says many now needed help to recover. He said it was ""vital"" to get ""young and old back on the sporting fields and facilities of Wales"". Tory Senedd members have triggered a vote on the subject later this afternoon, although it is not binding on Wales' ministers. You can read more about the planhere. A ban on landlords evicting firms for unpaid commercial rent is being extended for another nine months. The ban, which stops landlords taking tenants to court for non-payment, was due to end on 30 June. Treasury Secretary Stephen Barclay says the delay in easing lockdown restrictions, announced on Monday, ""presents additional challenges"" to business. It is estimated that firms in retail and hospitality are Â£5bn in rent debt. ""Existing measures will remain in place, including extending the current moratorium to protect commercial tenants from eviction to March 25, 2022,"" Mr Barclay tells the Commons. Thousands of companies, especially in the hospitality sector, are still unable to trade normally, among them nightclubs and leisure firms. BBC Radio 5 Live BBC Radio 5 Live is hearing what listeners think about plans to make all care home staff have a Covid vaccine. Tina Bentley, who runs a care home in Essex, says she is absolutely behind vaccinating all care home staff. She explains how all of her 36 members of staff are vaccinated: âFrom admin staff, to maintenance, everyone that entered my home on a staff level got vaccinated, and we had less heartache with that.â Tina says she sees the Covid vaccine as a fundamental safety measure, like PPE. âItâs not different to me putting a face mask on to protect someone. Youâre trying to make them safe, that is what we are trained to do. âSo for me, a vaccine keeps everybody safe,â she adds. But another caller, Molly, says she thinks introducing compulsory vaccines in the care sector is a âslippery slopeâ. Molly, who lives in Wiltshire, used to run a recruitment agency for the care sector. She adds: âIâm sure there will be legal challenges against this. No one should be forced to have a vaccine.â You can listen live to 5 Live on theBBC Sounds app. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Joe Biden gave his assessment of his meeting with Vladimir Putin in Geneva He said the talks were ""positive"" but warned the US would not tolerate interference in US democracy Putin described his talks with the US president as ""constructive"" He said the two sides agreed to return ambassadors after they were withdrawn earlier this year A wide range of topics, from cyber-attacks to Ukraine were discussed, but little in the way of concrete deals The meeting in Geneva was their first since Biden became president and was closely watched All times are GMT (BST-1) Edited by Jessica Murphy, Toby Luckhurst and Paul Kirby Thanks for tuning in to todayâs live coverage of the Biden
and Putin summit. Here are some of the key points from today:  Sophie Williams, David Walker and Holly
Honderich were our writing team today. The live page was edited by Paul Kirby, Toby Luckhurst and Jessica
Murphy. While the presidential plane waited to leave Geneva, President Biden took questions from reporters who were pressing him on what he had achieved during the Putin meeting. ""To be a journalist you have to have a negative world view, it seems,"" Biden said, chiding reporters for ""never"" asking a positive question. Pushed over whether or not he accomplished anything, he responds ""we will see"". Over the audible pleas of the president's team asking reporters to wrap up the questions, Biden continued to speak with them and defend his position with Putin. Biden apologised for being ""short"" and a ""wise guy"" to reporters, who he then called ""the brightest people in the country"". Vladimir Putin's two-decade reign as either president or prime minister of Russia has overlapped with the terms of five US presidents. Here's a look back at his meetings with the four who came before Joe Biden: Bill Clinton, George Bush, Barack Obama and Donald Trump. Putin and Bill Clinton met in 2000 in New York City George W Bush meanwhile met with Putin at his vacation home in 2008 Putin and President Obama shook hands for the cameras at a bilateral meeting at the UN headquarters in New York And President Donald Trump was photographed greeting Putin at the G20 Osaka Summit in 2019 Biden is known for his love of sunglasses President Biden gave his Russian counterpart two gifts at the summit, according to the White House. The first was a crystal sculpture of a US bison - ""one of our nation's most majestic mammals and representative of strength, unity, resilience"", a statement read. He also gave President Putin a pair of sunglasses - ""custom Aviators"". Biden is known for sporting Aviator sunglasses and has been photographed in the iconic shades many times. Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News A ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline in the US caused a surge of panic buying At least in public, the two leaders set out familiar
positions a world-apart. The US says Russia has carried out aggressive
cyber-espionage and sheltered criminalsattacking US infrastructure with ransomware.
But President Putin responded by suggesting most attacks in cyber-space come
from America and elsewhere. The US ambition for this meeting was to set out red lines
and President Biden suggested he did just that - saying he listed 16 sectors of
critical infrastructure that should be off-limits to attacks. He
said heâd also asked Putin how he would feel if Russiaâs oil
infrastructure was disrupted in the way that US fuel supplies were. This was no
threat, merely to make a point, he appeared to be saying. But he also pointed
out that Moscow knows the US has ""significant"" cyber capability - a clear
warning. Perhaps most significantly, Biden said the two
sides agreed to set up a working group to develop specific understandings in
cyber space and  follow up on specific cases. âAre they going to act? We
are going to find out,â he said. So rhetoric, warnings, denials and
red lines were all there as expected - but also the possibility of a route to
some kind of better understanding with the caution that this may or not
work.  In keeping with the two presidents' shared script of a ""cooperative"" meeting today, Putin and Biden have released a joint statement. The two countries have proven they are able to make progress on shared goals ""even in periods of tension"", they said. Russian-American cooperation helps reduce the threat of our own conflicts, and the threat of nuclear war, Putin and Biden said.  After a mostly congenial tone, Biden's post-Putin press conference ended in a flurry of confusion. Putting on his aviator sunglasses and making moves to leave, Biden continued to field questions as he walked off the stage. Journalists probed Biden on what concrete action he had managed to elicit from Putin, pointing to the Russian leader's defensiveness on human rights questions earlier today. Becoming visibly irritated, Biden walked back over to reporters, shaking his head at their questions. Asked why Biden was confident that Putin would change his behaviour after false promises in the past, the US president retorted: ""If you donât understand that, youâre in the wrong business."" Earlier, there was confusion after President Biden nodded when a reporter asked if he trusted President Putin. The White House issued a denial, saying he was ""clearly not responding to any one question, but nodding in acknowledgement to the press generally."" Asked at the news conference again about whether he could trust Putin, Biden said this was ""not about trust"". ""This
is about self interest and verification of self interest,"" he said. He said it was best to wait and see what happened, quoting an old saying. ""The proof of the pudding is in the eating. Weâre going to
know shortly,"" he said. This video can not be played Putin and Biden summit: Ongoing relations about 'mutual self-interest' When asked about restricted political freedoms in Russia, Putin pointed to the 6 January riots at the US Capitol, saying he didn't want that sort of chaos to happen in Russia. Asked about those remarks at his own news conference, Joe Biden laughed and said it was a ""ridiculous comparison"". On one hand, Biden said, you have ""criminals"" trying to take hold of the US Capitol. In Russia, you have people peacefully objecting, people who are not allowed to speak freely, he added. Petr KozlovBBC Russia First thing to point out is that the meeting lasted less
than what was originally announced - less than five hours. Second, just a few
minutes after the end of the negotiations, Vladimir Putin came out to
journalists and made a number of harsh statements - about the situation in
Ukraine, the situation with the opposition in Russia, saying that the actions
of the Russian authorities are no different from the actions of authorities in the US. On the whole, Vladimir Putin's press conference was largely a repetition
of what the Russian president has been saying for many years. The only new
element was perhaps stating that some restoration of diplomatic bodies is
possible, and that an exchange of citizens, convicted and imprisoned in Russia
and the United States, respectively, is possible.  This video can not be played Biden to Putin: I'm not against Russia or anyone else In his first question from reporters, President Biden is asked what he has done to prevent Russian election interference in the future. ""Whether I have stopped [election interference], Putin knows there will be consequences,"" Biden says. Russia is ""desperately trying to maintain its standing"" as a world power, Biden says. Losing this status will be ""the price they pay"" for continued interference. ""They are not able to dictate what happens in the world,"" he says. The same applies if Alexei Navalny dies. The consequences to Russia would be devastating, Biden says. Finishing his opening remarks, Biden said it was ""important to meet in
person so there could be no mistake about"" his intentions. ""I did what I came to do. Number one: identify areas of
practical work our two countries can do to advance our mutual interests and
also benefit the world. Two: Communicate directly, directly, that the US will
respond to actions that impair our vital interests or those of our allies. And
three, to clearly lay out our countryâs priorities and our values so he heard it
straight from me,"" he said. ""And I must tell you the tone of the entire meetings â I guess
it was a total of four hours â was good, positive,"" he said. ""There wasnât any strident
action taken."" Biden, like Putin, addresses cybersecurity early on, saying that the US identified certain cyber infrastructures that are ""off limits"". The US defined 16 such sites, defined as critical infrastructure. Russia agreed in principle, Biden says. But ""principle is one thing, it has to be backed up by practice"".  President Biden starts off with a firm but conciliatory tone. ""Where we have
differences I want President Putin to understand why I say what I say and why I
do what I do,"" Biden says. ""I
told President Putin my agenda is not against Russia or anyone else, itâs for
the American people,"" he said. Human rights ""are who we are"" as Americans, Biden says. They will ""always be on the table"". After President Putin's nearly hour-long press conference, his American counterpart is up now. President Joe Biden has taken the podium and is poised for questions. Vitaliy ShevchenkoBBC Monitoring Russian ambassador Anatoly Antonov will return to Washington
by July, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov has said. ""Mr Antonov is waiting with his bags packed. Since the order
has been received directly from the president, I think Mr Antonov will most
definitely return to Washington by the end of this month,"" Ryabkov told
journalists in Geneva, according to Interfax news agency. He was speaking after President Vladimir Putin told a news
conference after talks with US President Joe Biden that the ambassadors will be
restored. ""We have agreed that this issue has been
resolved,"" Putin said. ""They are returning to the places of
their permanent service. As to when exactly, tomorrow or the day after, that is
a purely technical issue,"" he said. We just heard from President Putin as he addressed journalists for nearly an hour. President Joe Biden should be up next - journalists in Geneva say he could take the stage any moment. Sarah RainsfordBBC Moscow Correspondent Speaking on BBC News Channel. Vladimir Putin was keen to spin a positive line on what happened. He
was quite warm, in fact, in talking about Joe Biden. One thing that stood out was how he said they had spoken eye to eye
for almost two hours. Itâs not every world leader you can do that with in such
detailed talks, he said. These were substantive, important, constructive talks, he stressed,
and there were a few points at which they managed to move the relationship
forward. They agreed to return ambassadors - without ambassadors itâs difficult
to see how you can talk about any kind of diplomatic relationship. There is an
agreement that the foreign ministers will look into the possible release and swap
of high-profile prisoners, both in Russia and the US, and consultations will be
held on strategic security. Vladimir Putin was keen to underline several times that Russia was a
nuclear power. It is an important country, yes its economy is far smaller than
the US, but it is a nuclear power and does matter. And thatâs why Joe Biden, in
Putinâs eyes, came to talk to him. During the press conference, the BBC's Steve Rosenberg asked about Russian ""unpredictability"", which he said the west believes is ""an inherent trait of the
Russian policy."" ""Are you ready to forego instability to improve?"" he asked the Russian President. It's clear that Putin was not a big fan of the question. ""You said the west believes that Russian policy is
unpredictable, well let me reciprocate. The US withdrawal from the ABM treaty
in 2002 was unpredictable. Why would they do that? ""Then disrupt and undermine
the basis of the strategic stability, the INF treaty withdrawal in 2019, is that
what you call stability, the open skies agreement withdrawal, well, is that what
you call stability? Thereâs almost no legs to stand on,"" he said. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,1.24429735e-05

""To be a journalist you have to have a negative world view, it seems,"" Biden said, chiding reporters for ""never"" asking a positive question. Pushed over whether or not he accomplished anything, he responds ""we will see"". Over the audible pleas of the president's team asking reporters to wrap up the questions, Biden continued to speak with them and defend his position with Putin. Biden apologised for being ""short"" and a ""wise guy"" to reporters, who he then called ""the brightest people in the country"". Vladimir Putin's two-decade reign as either president or prime minister of Russia has overlapped with the terms of five US presidents. Here's a look back at his meetings with the four who came before Joe Biden: Bill Clinton, George Bush, Barack Obama and Donald Trump. Putin and Bill Clinton met in 2000 in New York City George W Bush meanwhile met with Putin at his vacation home in 2008 Putin and President Obama shook hands for the cameras at a bilateral meeting at the UN headquarters in New York And President Donald Trump was photographed greeting Putin at the G20 Osaka Summit in 2019 Biden is known for his love of sunglasses President Biden gave his Russian counterpart two gifts at the summit, according to the White House. The first was a crystal sculpture of a US bison - ""one of our nation's most majestic mammals and representative of strength, unity, resilience"", a statement read. He also gave President Putin a pair of sunglasses - ""custom Aviators"". Biden is known for sporting Aviator sunglasses and has been photographed in the iconic shades many times. Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News A ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline in the US caused a surge of panic buying At least in public, the two leaders set out familiar
positions a world-apart. The US says Russia has carried out aggressive
cyber-espionage and sheltered criminalsattacking US infrastructure with ransomware.
But President Putin responded by suggesting most attacks in cyber-space come
from America and elsewhere. The US ambition for this meeting was to set out red lines
and President Biden suggested he did just that - saying he listed 16 sectors of
critical infrastructure that should be off-limits to attacks. He
said heâd also asked Putin how he would feel if Russiaâs oil
infrastructure was disrupted in the way that US fuel supplies were. This was no
threat, merely to make a point, he appeared to be saying. But he also pointed
out that Moscow knows the US has ""significant"" cyber capability - a clear
warning. Perhaps most significantly, Biden said the two
sides agreed to set up a working group to develop specific understandings in
cyber space and  follow up on specific cases. âAre they going to act? We
are going to find out,â he said. So rhetoric, warnings, denials and
red lines were all there as expected - but also the possibility of a route to
some kind of better understanding with the caution that this may or not
work.  In keeping with the two presidents' shared script of a ""cooperative"" meeting today, Putin and Biden have released a joint statement. The two countries have proven they are able to make progress on shared goals ""even in periods of tension"", they said. Russian-American cooperation helps reduce the threat of our own conflicts, and the threat of nuclear war, Putin and Biden said.  After a mostly congenial tone, Biden's post-Putin press conference ended in a flurry of confusion. Putting on his aviator sunglasses and making moves to leave, Biden continued to field questions as he walked off the stage. Journalists probed Biden on what concrete action he had managed to elicit from Putin, pointing to the Russian leader's defensiveness on human rights questions earlier today. Becoming visibly irritated, Biden walked back over to reporters, shaking his head at their questions. Asked why Biden was confident that Putin would change his behaviour after false promises in the past, the US president retorted: ""If you donât understand that, youâre in the wrong business."" Earlier, there was confusion after President Biden nodded when a reporter asked if he trusted President Putin. The White House issued a denial, saying he was ""clearly not responding to any one question, but nodding in acknowledgement to the press generally."" Asked at the news conference again about whether he could trust Putin, Biden said this was ""not about trust"". ""This
is about self interest and verification of self interest,"" he said. He said it was best to wait and see what happened, quoting an old saying. ""The proof of the pudding is in the eating. Weâre going to
know shortly,"" he said. This video can not be played Putin and Biden summit: Ongoing relations about 'mutual self-interest' When asked about restricted political freedoms in Russia, Putin pointed to the 6 January riots at the US Capitol, saying he didn't want that sort of chaos to happen in Russia. Asked about those remarks at his own news conference, Joe Biden laughed and said it was a ""ridiculous comparison"". On one hand, Biden said, you have ""criminals"" trying to take hold of the US Capitol. In Russia, you have people peacefully objecting, people who are not allowed to speak freely, he added. Petr KozlovBBC Russia First thing to point out is that the meeting lasted less
than what was originally announced - less than five hours. Second, just a few
minutes after the end of the negotiations, Vladimir Putin came out to
journalists and made a number of harsh statements - about the situation in
Ukraine, the situation with the opposition in Russia, saying that the actions
of the Russian authorities are no different from the actions of authorities in the US. On the whole, Vladimir Putin's press conference was largely a repetition
of what the Russian president has been saying for many years. The only new
element was perhaps stating that some restoration of diplomatic bodies is
possible, and that an exchange of citizens, convicted and imprisoned in Russia
and the United States, respectively, is possible.  This video can not be played Biden to Putin: I'm not against Russia or anyone else In his first question from reporters, President Biden is asked what he has done to prevent Russian election interference in the future. ""Whether I have stopped [election interference], Putin knows there will be consequences,"" Biden says. Russia is ""desperately trying to maintain its standing"" as a world power, Biden says. Losing this status will be ""the price they pay"" for continued interference. ""They are not able to dictate what happens in the world,"" he says. The same applies if Alexei Navalny dies. The consequences to Russia would be devastating, Biden says. Finishing his opening remarks, Biden said it was ""important to meet in
person so there could be no mistake about"" his intentions. ""I did what I came to do. Number one: identify areas of
practical work our two countries can do to advance our mutual interests and
also benefit the world. Two: Communicate directly, directly, that the US will
respond to actions that impair our vital interests or those of our allies. And
three, to clearly lay out our countryâs priorities and our values so he heard it
straight from me,"" he said. ""And I must tell you the tone of the entire meetings â I guess
it was a total of four hours â was good, positive,"" he said. ""There wasnât any strident
action taken."" Biden, like Putin, addresses cybersecurity early on, saying that the US identified certain cyber infrastructures that are ""off limits"". The US defined 16 such sites, defined as critical infrastructure. Russia agreed in principle, Biden says. But ""principle is one thing, it has to be backed up by practice"".  President Biden starts off with a firm but conciliatory tone. ""Where we have
differences I want President Putin to understand why I say what I say and why I
do what I do,"" Biden says. ""I
told President Putin my agenda is not against Russia or anyone else, itâs for
the American people,"" he said. Human rights ""are who we are"" as Americans, Biden says. They will ""always be on the table"". After President Putin's nearly hour-long press conference, his American counterpart is up now. President Joe Biden has taken the podium and is poised for questions. Vitaliy ShevchenkoBBC Monitoring Russian ambassador Anatoly Antonov will return to Washington
by July, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov has said. ""Mr Antonov is waiting with his bags packed. Since the order
has been received directly from the president, I think Mr Antonov will most
definitely return to Washington by the end of this month,"" Ryabkov told
journalists in Geneva, according to Interfax news agency. He was speaking after President Vladimir Putin told a news
conference after talks with US President Joe Biden that the ambassadors will be
restored. ""We have agreed that this issue has been
resolved,"" Putin said. ""They are returning to the places of
their permanent service. As to when exactly, tomorrow or the day after, that is
a purely technical issue,"" he said. We just heard from President Putin as he addressed journalists for nearly an hour. President Joe Biden should be up next - journalists in Geneva say he could take the stage any moment. Sarah RainsfordBBC Moscow Correspondent Speaking on BBC News Channel. Vladimir Putin was keen to spin a positive line on what happened. He
was quite warm, in fact, in talking about Joe Biden. One thing that stood out was how he said they had spoken eye to eye
for almost two hours. Itâs not every world leader you can do that with in such
detailed talks, he said. These were substantive, important, constructive talks, he stressed,
and there were a few points at which they managed to move the relationship
forward. They agreed to return ambassadors - without ambassadors itâs difficult
to see how you can talk about any kind of diplomatic relationship. There is an
agreement that the foreign ministers will look into the possible release and swap
of high-profile prisoners, both in Russia and the US, and consultations will be
held on strategic security. Vladimir Putin was keen to underline several times that Russia was a
nuclear power. It is an important country, yes its economy is far smaller than
the US, but it is a nuclear power and does matter. And thatâs why Joe Biden, in
Putinâs eyes, came to talk to him. During the press conference, the BBC's Steve Rosenberg asked about Russian ""unpredictability"", which he said the west believes is ""an inherent trait of the
Russian policy."" ""Are you ready to forego instability to improve?"" he asked the Russian President. It's clear that Putin was not a big fan of the question. ""You said the west believes that Russian policy is
unpredictable, well let me reciprocate. The US withdrawal from the ABM treaty
in 2002 was unpredictable. Why would they do that? ""Then disrupt and undermine
the basis of the strategic stability, the INF treaty withdrawal in 2019, is that
what you call stability, the open skies agreement withdrawal, well, is that what
you call stability? Thereâs almost no legs to stand on,"" he said. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.99402833

"The City of London skyline Goldman Sachs has delayed plans to bring all UK staff back into the office after the government extended coronavirus restrictions to July 19. The bank hadtold staff to be ready to return to the workplace in June,but confirmed the change in a note to workers late on Tuesday. Meanwhile, NatWest said its plans for ""priority workers"" to return on 21 June were also under review. Its new working model could see just 13% of staff in the office full-time. Goldman Sachs International chief executive, Richard Gnodde, told staff its office London remained ""open and available"" in line with government guidelines. He added that according to ""anonymised data"" from its recent vaccination survey, ""the majority of our people have either had their first dose or expect to receive it before Monday 21 June"". But a spokesman confirmed the bank now planned to get all staff back in the office after July 19. Goldman Sachs International's boss, Richard Gnodde, said its London office is '""open and available' Banks appear to be split over whether staff should come back to the office full-time or work from home for some or all days of the week Goldman Sachs' group chief executive, David Solomon, has described working from home as ""an aberration"", while James Gorman, the boss of rival US investment bank Morgan Stanley said:""If you can go into a restaurant in New York City, you can come into the office."" However, NatWest said just over a third of its 59,300 UK full-time employees would continue to work remotely. Some 55% of its staff would adopt a hybrid model of working between the office and home. NatWest chief executive, Alison Rose, said leaders would hold conversations with staff over the summer about which category they fall into. ""I would say that we've busted the myth that jobs need to be done in a certain way,"" she previously told staff. ""We have learnt new ways of working and it's important we carry those learnings forward."" Can I ask to keep working from home? The government's decision to delay easing all coronavirus restrictions from the original date of 21 June prompted criticism from hospitality industry groups,who said it could cost businesses Â£3bn in lost sales. In the City of London, also known as the Square Mile, the drop in people commuting to the offices of big firms has hampered shops, cafes and restaurants, which are reliant on workers to stay in business. David Abrahamovitch, chief executive and founder of Grind coffee shops, said the four-week delay to restrictions ending ""killed the summer"". He does not expect a ""material change"" in the number of commuters to city centres until September to October time. Mr Abrahamovitch said it was ""encouraging"" that some firms had decided workers would return to office working once restrictions are lifted, but added it was a ""completely different landscape"" compared to pre-pandemic times. ""We are a long way away of seeing the same kind of working patterns we had in 2019,"" he said. Mr Abrahamovitch said online subscriptions for Grind coffee had ""bailed us out"" during the pandemic, which had become the ""focus of our business"" now. Some traders have been working in Canary Wharf during the pandemic Barclays bank told the BBC it expected to ""invite"" more staff back to its Canary Wharf office over the summer, but said it was ""moving towards a hybrid way of working"". Barclays boss, Jes Staley, had previously said home working was ""not sustainable"" for large financial institutions. A HSBC spokesman said it planned to adopt a hybrid model of working. Despite several firms forecasting to have less people in their buildings,Marcus Geddes, managing director for central London for property giant Land Securities, said tenants and customers were ""telling us, loudly and clearly"" the office was a ""key part of ensuring productivity and culture can thrive"".

is about self interest and verification of self interest,"" he said. He said it was best to wait and see what happened, quoting an old saying. ""The proof of the pudding is in the eating. Weâre going to
know shortly,"" he said. This video can not be played Putin and Biden summit: Ongoing relations about 'mutual self-interest' When asked about restricted political freedoms in Russia, Putin pointed to the 6 January riots at the US Capitol, saying he didn't want that sort of chaos to happen in Russia. Asked about those remarks at his own news conference, Joe Biden laughed and said it was a ""ridiculous comparison"". On one hand, Biden said, you have ""criminals"" trying to take hold of the US Capitol. In Russia, you have people peacefully objecting, people who are not allowed to speak freely, he added. Petr KozlovBBC Russia First thing to point out is that the meeting lasted less
than what was originally announced - less than five hours. Second, just a few
minutes after the end of the negotiations, Vladimir Putin came out to
journalists and made a number of harsh statements - about the situation in
Ukraine, the situation with the opposition in Russia, saying that the actions
of the Russian authorities are no different from the actions of authorities in the US. On the whole, Vladimir Putin's press conference was largely a repetition
of what the Russian president has been saying for many years. The only new
element was perhaps stating that some restoration of diplomatic bodies is
possible, and that an exchange of citizens, convicted and imprisoned in Russia
and the United States, respectively, is possible.  This video can not be played Biden to Putin: I'm not against Russia or anyone else In his first question from reporters, President Biden is asked what he has done to prevent Russian election interference in the future. ""Whether I have stopped [election interference], Putin knows there will be consequences,"" Biden says. Russia is ""desperately trying to maintain its standing"" as a world power, Biden says. Losing this status will be ""the price they pay"" for continued interference. ""They are not able to dictate what happens in the world,"" he says. The same applies if Alexei Navalny dies. The consequences to Russia would be devastating, Biden says. Finishing his opening remarks, Biden said it was ""important to meet in
person so there could be no mistake about"" his intentions. ""I did what I came to do. Number one: identify areas of
practical work our two countries can do to advance our mutual interests and
also benefit the world. Two: Communicate directly, directly, that the US will
respond to actions that impair our vital interests or those of our allies. And
three, to clearly lay out our countryâs priorities and our values so he heard it
straight from me,"" he said. ""And I must tell you the tone of the entire meetings â I guess
it was a total of four hours â was good, positive,"" he said. ""There wasnât any strident
action taken."" Biden, like Putin, addresses cybersecurity early on, saying that the US identified certain cyber infrastructures that are ""off limits"". The US defined 16 such sites, defined as critical infrastructure. Russia agreed in principle, Biden says. But ""principle is one thing, it has to be backed up by practice"".  President Biden starts off with a firm but conciliatory tone. ""Where we have
differences I want President Putin to understand why I say what I say and why I
do what I do,"" Biden says. ""I
told President Putin my agenda is not against Russia or anyone else, itâs for
the American people,"" he said. Human rights ""are who we are"" as Americans, Biden says. They will ""always be on the table"". After President Putin's nearly hour-long press conference, his American counterpart is up now. President Joe Biden has taken the podium and is poised for questions. Vitaliy ShevchenkoBBC Monitoring Russian ambassador Anatoly Antonov will return to Washington
by July, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov has said. ""Mr Antonov is waiting with his bags packed. Since the order
has been received directly from the president, I think Mr Antonov will most
definitely return to Washington by the end of this month,"" Ryabkov told
journalists in Geneva, according to Interfax news agency. He was speaking after President Vladimir Putin told a news
conference after talks with US President Joe Biden that the ambassadors will be
restored. ""We have agreed that this issue has been
resolved,"" Putin said. ""They are returning to the places of
their permanent service. As to when exactly, tomorrow or the day after, that is
a purely technical issue,"" he said. We just heard from President Putin as he addressed journalists for nearly an hour. President Joe Biden should be up next - journalists in Geneva say he could take the stage any moment. Sarah RainsfordBBC Moscow Correspondent Speaking on BBC News Channel. Vladimir Putin was keen to spin a positive line on what happened. He
was quite warm, in fact, in talking about Joe Biden. One thing that stood out was how he said they had spoken eye to eye
for almost two hours. Itâs not every world leader you can do that with in such
detailed talks, he said. These were substantive, important, constructive talks, he stressed,
and there were a few points at which they managed to move the relationship
forward. They agreed to return ambassadors - without ambassadors itâs difficult
to see how you can talk about any kind of diplomatic relationship. There is an
agreement that the foreign ministers will look into the possible release and swap
of high-profile prisoners, both in Russia and the US, and consultations will be
held on strategic security. Vladimir Putin was keen to underline several times that Russia was a
nuclear power. It is an important country, yes its economy is far smaller than
the US, but it is a nuclear power and does matter. And thatâs why Joe Biden, in
Putinâs eyes, came to talk to him. During the press conference, the BBC's Steve Rosenberg asked about Russian ""unpredictability"", which he said the west believes is ""an inherent trait of the
Russian policy."" ""Are you ready to forego instability to improve?"" he asked the Russian President. It's clear that Putin was not a big fan of the question. ""You said the west believes that Russian policy is
unpredictable, well let me reciprocate. The US withdrawal from the ABM treaty
in 2002 was unpredictable. Why would they do that? ""Then disrupt and undermine
the basis of the strategic stability, the INF treaty withdrawal in 2019, is that
what you call stability, the open skies agreement withdrawal, well, is that what
you call stability? Thereâs almost no legs to stand on,"" he said. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,0.0010246963
"Joe Biden gave his assessment of his meeting with Vladimir Putin in Geneva He said the talks were ""positive"" but warned the US would not tolerate interference in US democracy Putin described his talks with the US president as ""constructive"" He said the two sides agreed to return ambassadors after they were withdrawn earlier this year A wide range of topics, from cyber-attacks to Ukraine were discussed, but little in the way of concrete deals The meeting in Geneva was their first since Biden became president and was closely watched All times are GMT (BST-1) Edited by Jessica Murphy, Toby Luckhurst and Paul Kirby Thanks for tuning in to todayâs live coverage of the Biden
and Putin summit. Here are some of the key points from today:  Sophie Williams, David Walker and Holly
Honderich were our writing team today. The live page was edited by Paul Kirby, Toby Luckhurst and Jessica
Murphy. While the presidential plane waited to leave Geneva, President Biden took questions from reporters who were pressing him on what he had achieved during the Putin meeting. ""To be a journalist you have to have a negative world view, it seems,"" Biden said, chiding reporters for ""never"" asking a positive question. Pushed over whether or not he accomplished anything, he responds ""we will see"". Over the audible pleas of the president's team asking reporters to wrap up the questions, Biden continued to speak with them and defend his position with Putin. Biden apologised for being ""short"" and a ""wise guy"" to reporters, who he then called ""the brightest people in the country"". Vladimir Putin's two-decade reign as either president or prime minister of Russia has overlapped with the terms of five US presidents. Here's a look back at his meetings with the four who came before Joe Biden: Bill Clinton, George Bush, Barack Obama and Donald Trump. Putin and Bill Clinton met in 2000 in New York City George W Bush meanwhile met with Putin at his vacation home in 2008 Putin and President Obama shook hands for the cameras at a bilateral meeting at the UN headquarters in New York And President Donald Trump was photographed greeting Putin at the G20 Osaka Summit in 2019 Biden is known for his love of sunglasses President Biden gave his Russian counterpart two gifts at the summit, according to the White House. The first was a crystal sculpture of a US bison - ""one of our nation's most majestic mammals and representative of strength, unity, resilience"", a statement read. He also gave President Putin a pair of sunglasses - ""custom Aviators"". Biden is known for sporting Aviator sunglasses and has been photographed in the iconic shades many times. Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News A ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline in the US caused a surge of panic buying At least in public, the two leaders set out familiar
positions a world-apart. The US says Russia has carried out aggressive
cyber-espionage and sheltered criminalsattacking US infrastructure with ransomware.
But President Putin responded by suggesting most attacks in cyber-space come
from America and elsewhere. The US ambition for this meeting was to set out red lines
and President Biden suggested he did just that - saying he listed 16 sectors of
critical infrastructure that should be off-limits to attacks. He
said heâd also asked Putin how he would feel if Russiaâs oil
infrastructure was disrupted in the way that US fuel supplies were. This was no
threat, merely to make a point, he appeared to be saying. But he also pointed
out that Moscow knows the US has ""significant"" cyber capability - a clear
warning. Perhaps most significantly, Biden said the two
sides agreed to set up a working group to develop specific understandings in
cyber space and  follow up on specific cases. âAre they going to act? We
are going to find out,â he said. So rhetoric, warnings, denials and
red lines were all there as expected - but also the possibility of a route to
some kind of better understanding with the caution that this may or not
work.  In keeping with the two presidents' shared script of a ""cooperative"" meeting today, Putin and Biden have released a joint statement. The two countries have proven they are able to make progress on shared goals ""even in periods of tension"", they said. Russian-American cooperation helps reduce the threat of our own conflicts, and the threat of nuclear war, Putin and Biden said.  After a mostly congenial tone, Biden's post-Putin press conference ended in a flurry of confusion. Putting on his aviator sunglasses and making moves to leave, Biden continued to field questions as he walked off the stage. Journalists probed Biden on what concrete action he had managed to elicit from Putin, pointing to the Russian leader's defensiveness on human rights questions earlier today. Becoming visibly irritated, Biden walked back over to reporters, shaking his head at their questions. Asked why Biden was confident that Putin would change his behaviour after false promises in the past, the US president retorted: ""If you donât understand that, youâre in the wrong business."" Earlier, there was confusion after President Biden nodded when a reporter asked if he trusted President Putin. The White House issued a denial, saying he was ""clearly not responding to any one question, but nodding in acknowledgement to the press generally."" Asked at the news conference again about whether he could trust Putin, Biden said this was ""not about trust"". ""This
is about self interest and verification of self interest,"" he said. He said it was best to wait and see what happened, quoting an old saying. ""The proof of the pudding is in the eating. Weâre going to

"In the US, a 13-year-old boy is vaccinated with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in May A decision to vaccinate all 12 to 17-year-old children against Covid is unlikely to be recommended by UK vaccine experts imminently, the BBC has been told. Certain groups of children may still be offered a Covid jab - but not all. A statement from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) is expected in the coming days. The government will then make a final decision on whether teenagers will be included in the mass rollout. Vaccinating all over-18s with a first dose and two-thirds of adults with a second dose by 19 July is the latest target set by the UK government. There has been much speculation over whether children were going to be included in the UK's vaccination programme against Covid-19 afterregulator the MHRA approved Pfizer's use in 12 to 15-year-olds recently. But the JCVI - the committee of UK vaccine experts which advises the government on the best approach - has not yet made any formal recommendation on the matter. Current advice is that 16 to 18-year-olds can be offered a Pfizer jab if they are in a priority group, or live with someone who has a weakened immune system. The committee may be waiting for more safety data on children who have been vaccinated in other countries, such as the US and Israel, before making its decision. Should all children get a Covid vaccine? How can I get my second jab sooner? Jabs to be compulsory for England care home staff The MHRA's approval was based on trials of the Pfizer vaccine in 2,200 adolescents in the US which showed it was safe and effective, but this is a relatively small number. At the same time, the UK's stock of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines is being prioritised for adults aged 18 to 40 - who are not being offered AstraZeneca - meaning supplies available for children are currently low. However, for the experts there are a whole host of factors to consider, including the benefits and risks for children, as well as other wider ethical issues. Children's risk of severe disease from Covid is tiny, deaths are extremely rare and have only occurred in UK children with profound underlying and life-limiting conditions. The direct benefits to them of vaccination would be low. Some people question whether it's morally right to vaccinate children in the UK, when so many millions of other people in the rest of the world are still unvaccinated. On the other hand, vaccinating children could reduce infections across society, help protect adults and the vulnerable who are most at risk, and keep schools open. ""This is a very finely balanced issue and a difficult decision,"" says Prof Calum Semple, professor of outbreak medicine and child health from the University of Liverpool, who is also a member of the scientific advisory group, Sage. He said he was ""veering towards not vaccinating children"" because of the need to get the vaccine into the arms of more hard-to-reach adults instead. ""The virus is spreading in schools because it's got nowhere else to hide at the moment,"" Prof Semple said, adding that improved ventilation in classrooms was much more of a priority than masks in schools. Vaccinating children would be ""mainly to protect public health and reduce transmission"", he added. It's possible the government is not rushing any decision because it wants to see the impact of vaccinating all adults in the UK on virus cases, which have been rising steadily since the end of May. A target of giving two doses to two-thirds of the UK's adult population was set by the prime minister on Monday - but that is principally the over-40s, who are due to receive the AstraZeneca vaccine. There are concerns there are not enough Pfizer or Moderna vaccines to start vaccinating younger age groups any earlier. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""No decisions have yet been made on whether people aged 12 to 17 should be routinely offered Covid-19 vaccines. ""We will be guided by our expert advisers, and the government has asked the JCVI for its formal recommendation. We will update in due course."" Should all children get a Covid vaccine?

"The hospitality industry is warning of the potential of ""another lost summer"" as Scottish ministers prepare to delay easing coronavirus restrictions. Nicola Sturgeon said on Tuesday that moving Scotland to level zero was likely to be pushed back three weeks. It means restrictions on bars, cafes, restaurants and hotels could be in place until the middle of July. The first minister told MSPs the delay would ensure more people could be vaccinated. Covid cases are continuing to rise in Scotland, where the infection rate is five times higher than it was in early May. Ms Sturgeon's statement came afterPrime Minister Boris Johnson announced on Monday that plans to lift restrictions in Englandwould be delayed by four weeks until 19 July. Scottish lockdown easing to be delayed until July How is Covid case rise affecting patient levels? What Covid rules are changing, and when? The Scottish Licensed Trade Association said the industry was now at ""breaking point"" and they called for more financial assistance for businesses. Its managing director, Colin Wilkinson, said: ""There needs to be an extension to the current support schemes available such as furlough, VAT reduction, deferral of loan repayments and so on. ""Our pubs and bars have already invested millions to provide a safe environment as we all learn to live with this virus and we need to be able to open without restrictions as soon as we can."" Mr Wilkinson said most hospitality businesses were continuing to operate at loss and racking up further debt. They have increased staff costs as they have to provide table service, but fewer tables - and customers - because of social distancing rules. But the situation is even worse for nightclubs, which would not even be allowed to open under level zero rules. ""This is a never-ending hell for hospitality workers and the businesses that employ them, especially those in the music and night-time sectors,"" said Stephen Montgomery, of the Scottish Hospitality Group. He asked the Scottish government to ""tweak the tiers"" so businesses could operate safely but viably. ""The government has shown that it can be flexible and understanding when it wants to, as we've seenwith the Euros and the fan zone,"" he added. ""All we're asking is for hospitality to be shown the same consideration."" He called on ministers to ""get out from behind their desks"" to understand how their policy decisions affect businesses, and to provide ""proper financial support"". It was echoed by the Federation of Small Businesses in Scotland, which said state support should be ""proportionate to the scale of the restrictions"". From next month,employers will have to contribute more to the wages of furloughed employeesahead of the scheme winding up at the end of September. Ahead of that, Finance Secretary Kate Forbes and her counterparts in Wales and Northern Ireland have written to the Chancellor of the Exchequer asking for an urgent meeting. They want to discuss the financial recovery from the pandemic, including the furlough scheme. Thousands of supporters have been allowed to gather in a Fan Zone in Glasgow to watch Euro 2020 matches Aformal decision on what level each area of Scotland will be in will not take place until next week, but Ms Sturgeon said on Tuesday it was ""reasonable to indicate now that I think it unlikely that any part of the country will move down a level"" as planned. It means the country's mainland council areas will remain in either level one or level two, although many island communities including Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles are already in level zero. Ms Sturgeon said that ""we need to buy sufficient time for vaccination to get ahead and stay ahead of the virus, and that is the reason for caution at this juncture"". She also said that a review of physical distancing rules would be published next week, along with a report on what life could look like once Scotland moves beyond level zero. Trade minister Ivan McKee said the Scottish government was trying to make the situation as ""painless as possible in this very difficult time for businesses"". He told theBBC's Good Morning Scotlandprogramme: ""We'll watch the data closely and, based on the direction the virus takes, then we're able to ascertain what measures could be taken. ""There's no point in loosening up too early and then we see a further spike in cases and hospitalisations. We've been here before [and] we don't want to see a third wave of that magnitude."" The Scottish Chambers of Commerce's chief executive Liz Cameron said the latest developments would be ""frustrating and painful"" for many Scottish businesses. She added: ""Any delay must be used to expand the vaccine rollout and deliver the crucial second doses that will move us out of lockdown restrictions faster.""

"This video can not be played Mr Hancock was asked by a reporter whether he was ""hopeless"" - he responded with ""I don't think so"" Dominic Cummings has published expletive-laden messages, apparently from Boris Johnson, in which the PM calls the health secretary ""hopeless"". It is the latest salvo in a bitter war of words between Mr Cummings, the PM's former top aide, and Matt Hancock over the handling of the pandemic. Downing Street did not deny the authenticity of the messages. But the PM's official spokesman insisted Mr Johnson has full confidence in the health secretary. In a 7,000-word blog, Mr Cummings accused Mr Hancock of trying to rewrite history during a select committee hearing last week which was examining how the government has managed various aspects of the crisis. He also took aim at Mr Johnson, claiming he had ""lied about failures"" during the government's initial response to the pandemic. ""If No 10 is prepared to lie so deeply and widely about such vital issues of life and death last year, it cannot be trusted now either on Covid or any other crucial issue of war and peace,"" Mr Cummings wrote. Kuenssberg: Cummings' gradual reveal of what was in that box Hancock defends not bringing in earlier lockdown Fact-checking Matt Hancock's Covid claims Dominic Cummings: The most explosive claims Mr Cummings told MPs three weeks ago that the health secretary had lied to the prime minister about testing hospital patients before they were released into care homes at the start of the pandemic - something firmly denied by Mr Hancock. A source close to Mr Hancock said: ""The health secretary answered many of Mr Cummings' claims at a lengthy session in front of MPs. ""Mr Cummings has still failed to provide evidence to substantiate his claims. ""The health secretary continues to work with the prime minister on the vaccine programme and getting us out of this pandemic as quickly as possible."" Mr Cummings, who was forced out of Downing Street last year, claims the version of events given to the committee by Mr Hancock was ""fiction"". The former aide appears to have kept WhatsApp messages from his time in government and selected six to share with readers of his blog. One of them appears to show an exchange between Mr Johnson and Mr Cummings on 27 March last year. Mr Cummings highlights the ramping up of testing capacity in the US and criticises Mr Hancock for saying he was ""sceptical"" about meeting a target. Mr Johnson purportedly responds: ""Totally [expletive] hopeless."" Mr Cummings also published another private message about the struggle to procure ventilators for Covid-19 patients. ""It's Hancock. He has been hopeless,"" a contact appearing to be Mr Johnson replies on 27 March last year. In another message, on 27 April last year, the prime minister appears to call the situation around personal protective equipment (PPE) ""a disaster"" and alludes to diverting some responsibilities to Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove. ""I can't think of anything except taking Hancock off and putting Gove on,"" Mr Johnson apparently adds. Mr Johnson's official spokesman said he was ""not going to be drawn on these claims"", adding that the prime minister has ""worked very closely with the health secretary and continues to do so"". Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth told Mr Hancock in a Commons debate that he had been ""forever branded Hopeless Hancock by his own leader"". The party's deputy leader Angela Rayner said a public inquiry into the pandemic promised for next spring was now needed ""as quickly as possible"". Mr Cummings suggests in his blog that any inquiry would not ""start for years"" as it was ""designed to punt the tricky parts until after this PM has gone"". This video can not be played ""Tens of thousands of people died who didn't need to die"", Dominic Cummings told MPs ""Unlike other PMs, this one has a clear plan to leave at the latest a couple of years after the next election, he wants to make money and have fun not 'go on and on',"" writes Mr Cummings. But with the Conservatives riding high in the opinion polls, there is no incentive for the party's MPs to move against Mr Johnson, despite the ""systemic incompetence"" surrounding him, he adds. Downing Street rejected the claim that Mr Johnson planned to stand down after the next election, saying: ""The PM has actually been asked this before and said it's utter nonsense, so that still stands."" Let's start with a quick political quiz. Q: Who has the safest job in cabinet? A: Matt Hancock Q: Why? A: Because Dominic Cummings wants him sacked. Boris Johnson's spokesman said the PM had full confidence in the health secretary. He could say little else - as he won't be sacking him at the urging of a disgruntled former aide. If he did, that would suggest that Dominic Cummings was right, about what he thinks were failures over PPE, ventilators and testing, early in the pandemic. And if Mr Hancock goes now, Labour would ask why he wasn't dismissed sooner. Mr Cummings makes serious allegations about the handling of the Covid crisis. But by continually suggesting that Matt Hancock is the very personification of government errors, he may be making it a little too easy for his detractors to portray his interventions as a grudge match. And by denouncing not just the Department of Health and Social Care but the Cabinet Office too, you get the impression that Mr Cummings felt that very few people could come up to his standards. Mr Cummings's own credibility, of course, still remains dented due tolast year's lockdown drive to Durham. But his latest dossier does raise questions of ministers well ahead of the formal inquiry, and provides ammunition to an opposition which has questioned the pace at which the government moved. Giving evidence to MPs last week, Mr Hancock said he had seen no evidence to suggest any medical staff had died because of a lack of PPE. In his blog, Mr Cummings accuses the health secretary of trying to blame NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens, Chancellor Rishi Sunak and the Cabinet Office for last April's ""PPE disaster"". ""The lack of PPE killed NHS and care home staff in March-May,"" he writes. He claims Number 10 and Mr Hancock had ""repeatedly lied about the failures last year"" and accuses them of now trying to ""rewrite history"", with the prime minister ""encouraging ministers to give false accounts to Parliament"". Mr Cummings goes on to criticise Mr Johnson's management style. In one section he contrasts Mr Johnson's approach with that of Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who stood in for the PM when he was in hospital with coronavirus. He said meetings with Mr Raab at the helm were ""less pleasant for everybody but much more productive"". He said this was because Mr Raab ""can chair meetings properly instead of telling rambling stories and jokes"". This video can not be played Five things Health Secretary Matt Hancock told MPs He went on to say that ""as soon as things get 'a bit embarrassing' [Boris Johnson] does the whole 'let's take it offline' shtick before shouting 'forward to victory', doing a thumbs-up and pegging it out of the room before anybody can disagree"". Downing Street said it was ""not going to engage"" with this claim. And on Thursday, Treasury minister Jesse Norman told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I think this is some of the biggest nonsense I've heard. ""The prime minister obviously, as anybody would detect, is a massive supporter of the health secretary. ""He's coming firmly behind him. There can be no question of loss of confidence."" Mr Cummings published the alleged leaks on Substack, an online platform that allows people to charge for newsletters. He has said he plans to charge subscribers for insider information on subjects other than the pandemic.

"Covid vaccinations are to become compulsory for staff at care homes in England, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said. Mr Hancock said it was a ""sensible and reasonable step"" and he would consult on extending it to the NHS. There are no plans to extend mandatory vaccinations beyond health and care workers, he said. Workers will have 16 weeks to get both jabs from the time regulations are approved by Parliament. If they do not, they face being redeployed away from front-line care or potentially losing their job. Mr Hancock told the House of Commons that the ""vast majority of staff in care homes"" were vaccinated, but not all of them. ""We know that the vaccine not only protects you but protects those around you,"" he said, adding that compulsory vaccinations in care homes and hospitals would save lives. What happened to care homes early in the pandemic? How many people have been vaccinated so far? When will I get the vaccine? Care organisations have warned that compulsory vaccinations could cause significant difficulties in a sector that already struggles to recruit enough people. The government, however, is believed to have considerable concerns about low take-up of the vaccine in some areas, including London. A Whitehall source told the BBC that guidance to doctors that they should take the Hepatitis B vaccine suggested there is a precedent for mandatory vaccination. The requirement will also apply to volunteers at care homes and those visiting for other work, such as healthcare workers, tradespeople, hairdressers and beauticians. Workers who can prove they are medically exempt from getting the vaccine will not be affected. There will be also be exemptions for visiting family and friends, under-18s, emergency services and people undertaking urgent maintenance work. Governments inScotland, Wales andNorthern Irelandhave said they have no plans to make Covid jabs mandatory for care home staff. It comes as the UK recorded a further 9,055 confirmed Covid cases and nine more deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Another 190,033 people received a first dose of the vaccine on Tuesday, bringing the total with at least one dose to more than 42 million - or 79.8% of adults. More than 30 million people - 57.8% of adults - have had both doses after a further 230,666 second jabs were given out. The move to mandatory vaccinations for care home staff in England follows a consultation by the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC), launched in April, two months after the government said it had met its target of offering all front-line care workers a first dose of a vaccine by mid-February. At the time, it said 47% of English care homes for older people had more than a fifth of staff yet to take up the vaccine, despite staff at all eligible care homes having been offered vaccines, with the vast majority of homes having had repeat visits by vaccine teams. Dr Susan Hopkins, strategic response director for Covid-19 at Public Health England, said there are ""pros and cons to any debate on mandatory vaccination"", with the ""pro"" being that those caring for the most vulnerable in care homes would be vaccinated, thus minimising the risks to residents. She said a possible downside could be that ""people may vote with their feet, and not want to have the vaccine, and therefore not work in a care home, and that could lead to staff supply issues in care homes"". Dr Hopkins said there had been ""excellent uptake"" of the vaccine, adding: ""I think where people are hesitant, we need to work harder to make them understand why the vaccines work."" This video can not be played Ros Atkins on: What are the Delta variant symptoms? The British Medical Association, which represents doctors, warned compulsion was ""a blunt instrument that carries its own risks"". It added: ""While some healthcare workers are already required to be immunised against certain conditions to work in certain areas, any specific proposal for the compulsory requirement for all staff to be vaccinated against Covid-19 would raise new ethical and legal implications."" Mike Padgham, chairman of the Independent Care Group (ICG) which represents care homes in Yorkshire, said he was disappointed by the decision and concerned it could cause legal disputes for providers. He told the Today programme: ""People should be vaccinated, every member of staff should take up the vaccine, but I just think persuasion rather than coercion or compulsion is the way to deal with it."" Susan Lord, whose mother lives in a care home in Leeds, said whilst it was ""great"" staff in the home had been vaccinated, she was ""concerned"" by the idea of mandatory jabs targeted solely at care workers. Susan Lord, whose mother is in a care home, said it seemed ""harsh"" to threaten the jobs of social care staff Ms Lord, from High Wycombe, told BBC News: ""If someone has been working in care for years and isn't able to have the vaccine or has strong objections to having it, it seems a little bit unfair that they're going to lose their job"". She said most care home staff only work in one place and are regularly tested, so it seems ""a little bit harsh"". Mr Padgham said the sector already had a ""recruitment crisis"", saying: ""We're frightened that this is going to put more people off coming into social care and that's going to be difficult."" Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK said: ""Every care home resident would want to be cared for by someone who had been vaccinated, but if a compulsory approach leads to some care workers quitting it will make existing chronic staff shortages even worse."" ""With or without mandatory vaccination,"" she said an approach of ""peer-to-peer persuasion"" should be taken in care homes, ""because this approach has been found to work well"". Low uptake among care home staff was a big concern when the vaccine programme was launched - similar issues are seen with the annual flu jab. Efforts have been made to convince staff of the need to get vaccinated - there have been advertising campaigns targeting them, webinars held by health leaders and repeat visits made to homes by vaccination teams. There are plenty of places where there has been good uptake. But there are also significant numbers of places where fewer than 80% of staff have been vaccinated - the threshold deemed essential to keep the virus out if 90% of residents are also vaccinated. Those working in the sector say there are a variety of reasons staff have cited - cultural reasons and concerns about safety. One common issue has been (unfounded) worries about its impact on fertility as the workforce is young and predominantly female. This move raises lots of concerns from individual rights to its potential to force staff out from a sector that is already short of workers. But the counter argument is that the vulnerabilities of residents and the closed environments they live in require drastic action. Kelly Andrews, national care lead of the GMB union and a former care worker told BBC News: ""We should not have forced vaccinations in social care, this is pushing the workforce away from social care in an area that we're already struggling to recruit and retain"". In a survey of about 1,000 of its carers, the GMB said, more than a third indicated they would quit their jobs if vaccines were mandated. In the care sector in Englandthere have been more than 40,000 deaths involving Covid.,external Additional reporting by Joseph Lee. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area?

"Joe Biden gave his assessment of his meeting with Vladimir Putin in Geneva He said the talks were ""positive"" but warned the US would not tolerate interference in US democracy Putin described his talks with the US president as ""constructive"" He said the two sides agreed to return ambassadors after they were withdrawn earlier this year A wide range of topics, from cyber-attacks to Ukraine were discussed, but little in the way of concrete deals The meeting in Geneva was their first since Biden became president and was closely watched All times are GMT (BST-1) Edited by Jessica Murphy, Toby Luckhurst and Paul Kirby Thanks for tuning in to todayâs live coverage of the Biden
and Putin summit. Here are some of the key points from today:  Sophie Williams, David Walker and Holly
Honderich were our writing team today. The live page was edited by Paul Kirby, Toby Luckhurst and Jessica
Murphy. While the presidential plane waited to leave Geneva, President Biden took questions from reporters who were pressing him on what he had achieved during the Putin meeting. ""To be a journalist you have to have a negative world view, it seems,"" Biden said, chiding reporters for ""never"" asking a positive question. Pushed over whether or not he accomplished anything, he responds ""we will see"". Over the audible pleas of the president's team asking reporters to wrap up the questions, Biden continued to speak with them and defend his position with Putin. Biden apologised for being ""short"" and a ""wise guy"" to reporters, who he then called ""the brightest people in the country"". Vladimir Putin's two-decade reign as either president or prime minister of Russia has overlapped with the terms of five US presidents. Here's a look back at his meetings with the four who came before Joe Biden: Bill Clinton, George Bush, Barack Obama and Donald Trump. Putin and Bill Clinton met in 2000 in New York City George W Bush meanwhile met with Putin at his vacation home in 2008 Putin and President Obama shook hands for the cameras at a bilateral meeting at the UN headquarters in New York And President Donald Trump was photographed greeting Putin at the G20 Osaka Summit in 2019 Biden is known for his love of sunglasses President Biden gave his Russian counterpart two gifts at the summit, according to the White House. The first was a crystal sculpture of a US bison - ""one of our nation's most majestic mammals and representative of strength, unity, resilience"", a statement read. He also gave President Putin a pair of sunglasses - ""custom Aviators"". Biden is known for sporting Aviator sunglasses and has been photographed in the iconic shades many times. Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News A ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline in the US caused a surge of panic buying At least in public, the two leaders set out familiar
positions a world-apart. The US says Russia has carried out aggressive
cyber-espionage and sheltered criminalsattacking US infrastructure with ransomware.
But President Putin responded by suggesting most attacks in cyber-space come
from America and elsewhere. The US ambition for this meeting was to set out red lines
and President Biden suggested he did just that - saying he listed 16 sectors of
critical infrastructure that should be off-limits to attacks. He
said heâd also asked Putin how he would feel if Russiaâs oil
infrastructure was disrupted in the way that US fuel supplies were. This was no
threat, merely to make a point, he appeared to be saying. But he also pointed
out that Moscow knows the US has ""significant"" cyber capability - a clear
warning. Perhaps most significantly, Biden said the two
sides agreed to set up a working group to develop specific understandings in
cyber space and  follow up on specific cases. âAre they going to act? We
are going to find out,â he said. So rhetoric, warnings, denials and
red lines were all there as expected - but also the possibility of a route to
some kind of better understanding with the caution that this may or not
work.  In keeping with the two presidents' shared script of a ""cooperative"" meeting today, Putin and Biden have released a joint statement. The two countries have proven they are able to make progress on shared goals ""even in periods of tension"", they said. Russian-American cooperation helps reduce the threat of our own conflicts, and the threat of nuclear war, Putin and Biden said.  After a mostly congenial tone, Biden's post-Putin press conference ended in a flurry of confusion. Putting on his aviator sunglasses and making moves to leave, Biden continued to field questions as he walked off the stage. Journalists probed Biden on what concrete action he had managed to elicit from Putin, pointing to the Russian leader's defensiveness on human rights questions earlier today. Becoming visibly irritated, Biden walked back over to reporters, shaking his head at their questions. Asked why Biden was confident that Putin would change his behaviour after false promises in the past, the US president retorted: ""If you donât understand that, youâre in the wrong business."" Earlier, there was confusion after President Biden nodded when a reporter asked if he trusted President Putin. The White House issued a denial, saying he was ""clearly not responding to any one question, but nodding in acknowledgement to the press generally."" Asked at the news conference again about whether he could trust Putin, Biden said this was ""not about trust"". ""This
is about self interest and verification of self interest,"" he said. He said it was best to wait and see what happened, quoting an old saying. ""The proof of the pudding is in the eating. Weâre going to
know shortly,"" he said. This video can not be played Putin and Biden summit: Ongoing relations about 'mutual self-interest' When asked about restricted political freedoms in Russia, Putin pointed to the 6 January riots at the US Capitol, saying he didn't want that sort of chaos to happen in Russia. Asked about those remarks at his own news conference, Joe Biden laughed and said it was a ""ridiculous comparison"". On one hand, Biden said, you have ""criminals"" trying to take hold of the US Capitol. In Russia, you have people peacefully objecting, people who are not allowed to speak freely, he added. Petr KozlovBBC Russia First thing to point out is that the meeting lasted less
than what was originally announced - less than five hours. Second, just a few
minutes after the end of the negotiations, Vladimir Putin came out to
journalists and made a number of harsh statements - about the situation in
Ukraine, the situation with the opposition in Russia, saying that the actions
of the Russian authorities are no different from the actions of authorities in the US. On the whole, Vladimir Putin's press conference was largely a repetition
of what the Russian president has been saying for many years. The only new
element was perhaps stating that some restoration of diplomatic bodies is
possible, and that an exchange of citizens, convicted and imprisoned in Russia
and the United States, respectively, is possible.  This video can not be played Biden to Putin: I'm not against Russia or anyone else In his first question from reporters, President Biden is asked what he has done to prevent Russian election interference in the future. ""Whether I have stopped [election interference], Putin knows there will be consequences,"" Biden says. Russia is ""desperately trying to maintain its standing"" as a world power, Biden says. Losing this status will be ""the price they pay"" for continued interference. ""They are not able to dictate what happens in the world,"" he says. The same applies if Alexei Navalny dies. The consequences to Russia would be devastating, Biden says. Finishing his opening remarks, Biden said it was ""important to meet in
person so there could be no mistake about"" his intentions. ""I did what I came to do. Number one: identify areas of
practical work our two countries can do to advance our mutual interests and
also benefit the world. Two: Communicate directly, directly, that the US will
respond to actions that impair our vital interests or those of our allies. And
three, to clearly lay out our countryâs priorities and our values so he heard it
straight from me,"" he said. ""And I must tell you the tone of the entire meetings â I guess
it was a total of four hours â was good, positive,"" he said. ""There wasnât any strident
action taken."" Biden, like Putin, addresses cybersecurity early on, saying that the US identified certain cyber infrastructures that are ""off limits"". The US defined 16 such sites, defined as critical infrastructure. Russia agreed in principle, Biden says. But ""principle is one thing, it has to be backed up by practice"".  President Biden starts off with a firm but conciliatory tone. ""Where we have
differences I want President Putin to understand why I say what I say and why I
do what I do,"" Biden says. ""I
told President Putin my agenda is not against Russia or anyone else, itâs for
the American people,"" he said. Human rights ""are who we are"" as Americans, Biden says. They will ""always be on the table"". After President Putin's nearly hour-long press conference, his American counterpart is up now. President Joe Biden has taken the podium and is poised for questions. Vitaliy ShevchenkoBBC Monitoring Russian ambassador Anatoly Antonov will return to Washington
by July, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov has said. ""Mr Antonov is waiting with his bags packed. Since the order
has been received directly from the president, I think Mr Antonov will most
definitely return to Washington by the end of this month,"" Ryabkov told
journalists in Geneva, according to Interfax news agency. He was speaking after President Vladimir Putin told a news
conference after talks with US President Joe Biden that the ambassadors will be
restored. ""We have agreed that this issue has been
resolved,"" Putin said. ""They are returning to the places of
their permanent service. As to when exactly, tomorrow or the day after, that is
a purely technical issue,"" he said. We just heard from President Putin as he addressed journalists for nearly an hour. President Joe Biden should be up next - journalists in Geneva say he could take the stage any moment. Sarah RainsfordBBC Moscow Correspondent Speaking on BBC News Channel. Vladimir Putin was keen to spin a positive line on what happened. He
was quite warm, in fact, in talking about Joe Biden. One thing that stood out was how he said they had spoken eye to eye
for almost two hours. Itâs not every world leader you can do that with in such
detailed talks, he said. These were substantive, important, constructive talks, he stressed,
and there were a few points at which they managed to move the relationship
forward. They agreed to return ambassadors - without ambassadors itâs difficult
to see how you can talk about any kind of diplomatic relationship. There is an
agreement that the foreign ministers will look into the possible release and swap
of high-profile prisoners, both in Russia and the US, and consultations will be
held on strategic security. Vladimir Putin was keen to underline several times that Russia was a
nuclear power. It is an important country, yes its economy is far smaller than
the US, but it is a nuclear power and does matter. And thatâs why Joe Biden, in
Putinâs eyes, came to talk to him. During the press conference, the BBC's Steve Rosenberg asked about Russian ""unpredictability"", which he said the west believes is ""an inherent trait of the
Russian policy."" ""Are you ready to forego instability to improve?"" he asked the Russian President. It's clear that Putin was not a big fan of the question. ""You said the west believes that Russian policy is
unpredictable, well let me reciprocate. The US withdrawal from the ABM treaty
in 2002 was unpredictable. Why would they do that? ""Then disrupt and undermine
the basis of the strategic stability, the INF treaty withdrawal in 2019, is that
what you call stability, the open skies agreement withdrawal, well, is that what
you call stability? Thereâs almost no legs to stand on,"" he said. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,1.0

The team with you today were Justin Parkinson, Paul Seddon, Richard Morris, and Sinead Wilson. Do join us again next week. As the PM's statement winds down, we're going to close our coverage from the Commons this afternoon. Here's a quick recap of the main points from this week's PMQs and the statement on the G7 and Nato summits Reality Check At PMQs Labour leader Keir Starmer criticised the government over its border policy, arguing that adding India to
the travel restrictions red list on 23 April 2020, had allowed the Delta
variant (which was first identified in India) to spread in the UK. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said:
âWe put India on the red list on 23 April and the Delta variant was not so
identified until 28 April.â Public
Health England declared the Delta variant to be a âvariant under investigationâ
on 28 April, categorising it as a âvariant of concernâ on 6 May. Itâs
worth noting that it had already been designated as a âvariant of
interestâ by theWorld Health Organisation on 4 April,external. And
it was first sequenced in the UK in the week beginning 8 March. You canread more hereabout the

Labour's Christian Matheson raises the so-called ""sausage dispute"" concerning Brexit customs checks in Northern Ireland. He says it shows ""we are miles away"" from free trade agreements outweighing the economic impact of Brexit and we risk alienating our biggest trading partners. The PM says we have a free trade deal with the EU. He says it is a ""fantastic deal"" and out trade with the US is ""growing the whole time"". Lockdown sceptic and Conservative MP,  Mark Harper, says after we have  vaccinated the world to protect people, we need to ""learn to live with what will be an endemic virus"". He asks if the PM  shares his concerns about suggestions in government that  restrictions could come  back in the autumn as cases rise and he asks Mr Johnson to reassure people that will not happen? The prime minister says his objective is to go forward with the roadmap and ""bring back the freedoms we love"". Conservative Laura Trott says she welcomes the PM's focus on gender equality at the G7 and says she notes Keir Starmer did not mention girls or women once in his opening statement. Can the PM come back to the House before 2026 she asks to reassure MPs that progress is being made when it comes to girls' education and ending violence against women. The PM says ""of course"" he will adding the project will be ""scarcely off my lips"" Conservative Tobias Ellwood says the ""rise of China"" technologically means that ""this will be their century"". He says the actions that the UK decides to take in the next few years will ""determine how the next few decades play out"". Boris Johnson says it was ""great to see a summit achieve so much"". Labour's Chi Onwurah says action on tackling tax avoidance from multinationals was ""watered down"" after Boris Johnson didn't back the original US proposal for a minimum 21% corporation tax rate. She says this would have provided an extra Â£15bn for the UK Treasury. The prime minister points out Labour opposed government plans to increase the UK's corporation tax rate from 19% to 25% from 2023 at this year's Budget. He says the deal leaderseventually agreed- to set a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15% - is a ""great achievement"" and a ""great step forward"". Labour MP Florence Eshalomi says girls' education is the best way to lift people out of poverty globally. She asks if there is a ""gaping hole between"" the prime ministers ""words and actions"". Boris Johnson says there was ""massive, overwhelming support"" for girls' education around the world at the G7. He adds that the UK is adding 15% more to education despite the cuts. Labour's Hilary Benn asks where Boris Johnson thinks the necessary vaccines will come from to vaccinate the world. G7 leaders pledged last week to provide a billion doses between them in 2022, but the World Health Organization says 11 billion will be needed to vaccinate 70% of the world's population. Boris Johnson says it has only been ""a few months"" since the vaccines were invented, and countries are ""going as fast we can"". He adds that the G7 is committed to vaccinating the world by the end of next year. Conservative chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee Tom Tugendhat asks if the government will commit to informing MPs ahead of time of climate commitments made at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow later this year. Boris Johnson says he will ""do his best to oblige"" what Mr Tugendhat is asking for, but he says his experience is that the House of Commons is not ""a great negotiator"". Conservative Derek Thomas, whose St Ives constituency covers Carbis Bay, where the G7 summit took place, calls it an ""absolutely fantastic event"". He adds that he and his constituents are ""proud of the Carbis Bay declaration"" that followed. The PM says the declaration is fundamental to dealing with the pandemic, setting out timetables for vaccine development. Former Defence Secretary Liam Fox says the G7 ""did Britain proud"" and asks if the Nato summit discussed ways of combating the reliance on Russia for energy by several European countries. The PM says there was discussion on how Nato members could reach an end to the need for hydrocarbons for energy, irrespective of strategic needs. Green MP Caroline Lucas says the failure of the G7 to stop investing in all fossil fuels speaks on the UK's ""climate leadership"". She asks if the UK will pursue a ""global fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty"" as is being called for by 101 Nobel Laureates. Boris Johnson says it was ""groundbreaking"" not to agree to any more overseas coal, and changes ""can be done"". In 2012, he says, 40% of UK power came from coal, it's now down to less than 2% and ""falling the whole time"". Conservative MP Greg Smith asks Boris Johnson whether he remains ""utterly committed"" to the Nato alliance after last week's summit. The prime minister replies Nato ""has protected the world and particularity the European continent"" for 72 years, and it was clear leaders thought it will ""continue to do so for decades to come"". Conservative Sir Bernard Jenkin says that if peace and stability in Northern Ireland is being undermined by the NI Protocol, then it is obvious it should be re-examined. He asks the PM to consider a different policy. Boris Johnson says that peace and trade in accordance with the Good Friday Agreement ""must be upheld"". He says if this cannot be achieved, he will consider other options. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey says the prime minister's approach of ""do as I say, not as I do"" on aid, democracy and funding global education is ""ruinous"" of the UK's reputation. Boris Johnson replies that the Conservatives have been able to do more good since being in power as a single party, rather than in coalition, ""freed from the shackles of Lib Dem hypocrisy"". Conservative former international development secretary Andrew Mitchell, says the UK is the only major nation which is cutting aid overseas during a pandemic, which will cost lives of women and children. Mitchell has been a vocal critic of the cuts. Boris Johnson says concerns about the aid cuts have not been raised by the recipients in any country which receives aid. He says the UK is still committing Â£10bn this year to supporting countries around the world. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Joe Biden gave his assessment of his meeting with Vladimir Putin in Geneva He said the talks were ""positive"" but warned the US would not tolerate interference in US democracy Putin described his talks with the US president as ""constructive"" He said the two sides agreed to return ambassadors after they were withdrawn earlier this year A wide range of topics, from cyber-attacks to Ukraine were discussed, but little in the way of concrete deals The meeting in Geneva was their first since Biden became president and was closely watched All times are GMT (BST-1) Edited by Jessica Murphy, Toby Luckhurst and Paul Kirby Thanks for tuning in to todayâs live coverage of the Biden
and Putin summit. Here are some of the key points from today:  Sophie Williams, David Walker and Holly
Honderich were our writing team today. The live page was edited by Paul Kirby, Toby Luckhurst and Jessica
Murphy. While the presidential plane waited to leave Geneva, President Biden took questions from reporters who were pressing him on what he had achieved during the Putin meeting. ""To be a journalist you have to have a negative world view, it seems,"" Biden said, chiding reporters for ""never"" asking a positive question. Pushed over whether or not he accomplished anything, he responds ""we will see"". Over the audible pleas of the president's team asking reporters to wrap up the questions, Biden continued to speak with them and defend his position with Putin. Biden apologised for being ""short"" and a ""wise guy"" to reporters, who he then called ""the brightest people in the country"". Vladimir Putin's two-decade reign as either president or prime minister of Russia has overlapped with the terms of five US presidents. Here's a look back at his meetings with the four who came before Joe Biden: Bill Clinton, George Bush, Barack Obama and Donald Trump. Putin and Bill Clinton met in 2000 in New York City George W Bush meanwhile met with Putin at his vacation home in 2008 Putin and President Obama shook hands for the cameras at a bilateral meeting at the UN headquarters in New York And President Donald Trump was photographed greeting Putin at the G20 Osaka Summit in 2019 Biden is known for his love of sunglasses President Biden gave his Russian counterpart two gifts at the summit, according to the White House. The first was a crystal sculpture of a US bison - ""one of our nation's most majestic mammals and representative of strength, unity, resilience"", a statement read. He also gave President Putin a pair of sunglasses - ""custom Aviators"". Biden is known for sporting Aviator sunglasses and has been photographed in the iconic shades many times. Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News A ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline in the US caused a surge of panic buying At least in public, the two leaders set out familiar
positions a world-apart. The US says Russia has carried out aggressive
cyber-espionage and sheltered criminalsattacking US infrastructure with ransomware.
But President Putin responded by suggesting most attacks in cyber-space come
from America and elsewhere. The US ambition for this meeting was to set out red lines
and President Biden suggested he did just that - saying he listed 16 sectors of
critical infrastructure that should be off-limits to attacks. He
said heâd also asked Putin how he would feel if Russiaâs oil
infrastructure was disrupted in the way that US fuel supplies were. This was no
threat, merely to make a point, he appeared to be saying. But he also pointed
out that Moscow knows the US has ""significant"" cyber capability - a clear
warning. Perhaps most significantly, Biden said the two
sides agreed to set up a working group to develop specific understandings in
cyber space and  follow up on specific cases. âAre they going to act? We
are going to find out,â he said. So rhetoric, warnings, denials and
red lines were all there as expected - but also the possibility of a route to
some kind of better understanding with the caution that this may or not
work.  In keeping with the two presidents' shared script of a ""cooperative"" meeting today, Putin and Biden have released a joint statement. The two countries have proven they are able to make progress on shared goals ""even in periods of tension"", they said. Russian-American cooperation helps reduce the threat of our own conflicts, and the threat of nuclear war, Putin and Biden said.  After a mostly congenial tone, Biden's post-Putin press conference ended in a flurry of confusion. Putting on his aviator sunglasses and making moves to leave, Biden continued to field questions as he walked off the stage. Journalists probed Biden on what concrete action he had managed to elicit from Putin, pointing to the Russian leader's defensiveness on human rights questions earlier today. Becoming visibly irritated, Biden walked back over to reporters, shaking his head at their questions. Asked why Biden was confident that Putin would change his behaviour after false promises in the past, the US president retorted: ""If you donât understand that, youâre in the wrong business."" Earlier, there was confusion after President Biden nodded when a reporter asked if he trusted President Putin. The White House issued a denial, saying he was ""clearly not responding to any one question, but nodding in acknowledgement to the press generally."" Asked at the news conference again about whether he could trust Putin, Biden said this was ""not about trust"". ""This
is about self interest and verification of self interest,"" he said. He said it was best to wait and see what happened, quoting an old saying. ""The proof of the pudding is in the eating. Weâre going to
know shortly,"" he said. This video can not be played Putin and Biden summit: Ongoing relations about 'mutual self-interest' When asked about restricted political freedoms in Russia, Putin pointed to the 6 January riots at the US Capitol, saying he didn't want that sort of chaos to happen in Russia. Asked about those remarks at his own news conference, Joe Biden laughed and said it was a ""ridiculous comparison"". On one hand, Biden said, you have ""criminals"" trying to take hold of the US Capitol. In Russia, you have people peacefully objecting, people who are not allowed to speak freely, he added. Petr KozlovBBC Russia First thing to point out is that the meeting lasted less
than what was originally announced - less than five hours. Second, just a few
minutes after the end of the negotiations, Vladimir Putin came out to
journalists and made a number of harsh statements - about the situation in
Ukraine, the situation with the opposition in Russia, saying that the actions
of the Russian authorities are no different from the actions of authorities in the US. On the whole, Vladimir Putin's press conference was largely a repetition
of what the Russian president has been saying for many years. The only new
element was perhaps stating that some restoration of diplomatic bodies is
possible, and that an exchange of citizens, convicted and imprisoned in Russia
and the United States, respectively, is possible.  This video can not be played Biden to Putin: I'm not against Russia or anyone else In his first question from reporters, President Biden is asked what he has done to prevent Russian election interference in the future. ""Whether I have stopped [election interference], Putin knows there will be consequences,"" Biden says. Russia is ""desperately trying to maintain its standing"" as a world power, Biden says. Losing this status will be ""the price they pay"" for continued interference. ""They are not able to dictate what happens in the world,"" he says. The same applies if Alexei Navalny dies. The consequences to Russia would be devastating, Biden says. Finishing his opening remarks, Biden said it was ""important to meet in
person so there could be no mistake about"" his intentions. ""I did what I came to do. Number one: identify areas of
practical work our two countries can do to advance our mutual interests and
also benefit the world. Two: Communicate directly, directly, that the US will
respond to actions that impair our vital interests or those of our allies. And
three, to clearly lay out our countryâs priorities and our values so he heard it
straight from me,"" he said. ""And I must tell you the tone of the entire meetings â I guess
it was a total of four hours â was good, positive,"" he said. ""There wasnât any strident
action taken."" Biden, like Putin, addresses cybersecurity early on, saying that the US identified certain cyber infrastructures that are ""off limits"". The US defined 16 such sites, defined as critical infrastructure. Russia agreed in principle, Biden says. But ""principle is one thing, it has to be backed up by practice"".  President Biden starts off with a firm but conciliatory tone. ""Where we have
differences I want President Putin to understand why I say what I say and why I
do what I do,"" Biden says. ""I
told President Putin my agenda is not against Russia or anyone else, itâs for
the American people,"" he said. Human rights ""are who we are"" as Americans, Biden says. They will ""always be on the table"". After President Putin's nearly hour-long press conference, his American counterpart is up now. President Joe Biden has taken the podium and is poised for questions. Vitaliy ShevchenkoBBC Monitoring Russian ambassador Anatoly Antonov will return to Washington
by July, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov has said. ""Mr Antonov is waiting with his bags packed. Since the order
has been received directly from the president, I think Mr Antonov will most
definitely return to Washington by the end of this month,"" Ryabkov told
journalists in Geneva, according to Interfax news agency. He was speaking after President Vladimir Putin told a news
conference after talks with US President Joe Biden that the ambassadors will be
restored. ""We have agreed that this issue has been
resolved,"" Putin said. ""They are returning to the places of
their permanent service. As to when exactly, tomorrow or the day after, that is
a purely technical issue,"" he said. We just heard from President Putin as he addressed journalists for nearly an hour. President Joe Biden should be up next - journalists in Geneva say he could take the stage any moment. Sarah RainsfordBBC Moscow Correspondent Speaking on BBC News Channel. Vladimir Putin was keen to spin a positive line on what happened. He
was quite warm, in fact, in talking about Joe Biden. One thing that stood out was how he said they had spoken eye to eye
for almost two hours. Itâs not every world leader you can do that with in such
detailed talks, he said. These were substantive, important, constructive talks, he stressed,
and there were a few points at which they managed to move the relationship
forward. They agreed to return ambassadors - without ambassadors itâs difficult
to see how you can talk about any kind of diplomatic relationship. There is an
agreement that the foreign ministers will look into the possible release and swap
of high-profile prisoners, both in Russia and the US, and consultations will be
held on strategic security. Vladimir Putin was keen to underline several times that Russia was a
nuclear power. It is an important country, yes its economy is far smaller than
the US, but it is a nuclear power and does matter. And thatâs why Joe Biden, in
Putinâs eyes, came to talk to him. During the press conference, the BBC's Steve Rosenberg asked about Russian ""unpredictability"", which he said the west believes is ""an inherent trait of the
Russian policy."" ""Are you ready to forego instability to improve?"" he asked the Russian President. It's clear that Putin was not a big fan of the question. ""You said the west believes that Russian policy is
unpredictable, well let me reciprocate. The US withdrawal from the ABM treaty
in 2002 was unpredictable. Why would they do that? ""Then disrupt and undermine
the basis of the strategic stability, the INF treaty withdrawal in 2019, is that
what you call stability, the open skies agreement withdrawal, well, is that what
you call stability? Thereâs almost no legs to stand on,"" he said. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,6.4222996e-07
"Labour leader Keir Starmer has accused the PM of letting the Delta variant in by not toughening rules on travel from India sooner The prime minister said the government took the ""most drastic steps"" to put India on the red list The PM's former aide Dominic Cummings has released a highly critical Whatsapp messages about Matt Hancock which appear to have been written by Mr Johnson Boris Johnson made a statement updating MPs on the outcomes from the G7 and Nato summits MPs will hold a debate later on the government's plans to keep coronavirus restrictions in place until 19 July On Monday, the prime minister announced that the final stage of easing lockdown restrictions in England would be delayed for four weeks Edited by Johanna Howitt BBC Politics Thanks for following along with us this afternoon. The team with you today were Justin Parkinson, Paul Seddon, Richard Morris, and Sinead Wilson. Do join us again next week. As the PM's statement winds down, we're going to close our coverage from the Commons this afternoon. Here's a quick recap of the main points from this week's PMQs and the statement on the G7 and Nato summits Reality Check At PMQs Labour leader Keir Starmer criticised the government over its border policy, arguing that adding India to
the travel restrictions red list on 23 April 2020, had allowed the Delta
variant (which was first identified in India) to spread in the UK. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said:
âWe put India on the red list on 23 April and the Delta variant was not so
identified until 28 April.â Public
Health England declared the Delta variant to be a âvariant under investigationâ
on 28 April, categorising it as a âvariant of concernâ on 6 May. Itâs
worth noting that it had already been designated as a âvariant of
interestâ by theWorld Health Organisation on 4 April,external. And
it was first sequenced in the UK in the week beginning 8 March. You canread more hereabout the

Labour's Christian Matheson raises the so-called ""sausage dispute"" concerning Brexit customs checks in Northern Ireland. He says it shows ""we are miles away"" from free trade agreements outweighing the economic impact of Brexit and we risk alienating our biggest trading partners. The PM says we have a free trade deal with the EU. He says it is a ""fantastic deal"" and out trade with the US is ""growing the whole time"". Lockdown sceptic and Conservative MP,  Mark Harper, says after we have  vaccinated the world to protect people, we need to ""learn to live with what will be an endemic virus"". He asks if the PM  shares his concerns about suggestions in government that  restrictions could come  back in the autumn as cases rise and he asks Mr Johnson to reassure people that will not happen? The prime minister says his objective is to go forward with the roadmap and ""bring back the freedoms we love"". Conservative Laura Trott says she welcomes the PM's focus on gender equality at the G7 and says she notes Keir Starmer did not mention girls or women once in his opening statement. Can the PM come back to the House before 2026 she asks to reassure MPs that progress is being made when it comes to girls' education and ending violence against women. The PM says ""of course"" he will adding the project will be ""scarcely off my lips"" Conservative Tobias Ellwood says the ""rise of China"" technologically means that ""this will be their century"". He says the actions that the UK decides to take in the next few years will ""determine how the next few decades play out"". Boris Johnson says it was ""great to see a summit achieve so much"". Labour's Chi Onwurah says action on tackling tax avoidance from multinationals was ""watered down"" after Boris Johnson didn't back the original US proposal for a minimum 21% corporation tax rate. She says this would have provided an extra Â£15bn for the UK Treasury. The prime minister points out Labour opposed government plans to increase the UK's corporation tax rate from 19% to 25% from 2023 at this year's Budget. He says the deal leaderseventually agreed- to set a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15% - is a ""great achievement"" and a ""great step forward"". Labour MP Florence Eshalomi says girls' education is the best way to lift people out of poverty globally. She asks if there is a ""gaping hole between"" the prime ministers ""words and actions"". Boris Johnson says there was ""massive, overwhelming support"" for girls' education around the world at the G7. He adds that the UK is adding 15% more to education despite the cuts. Labour's Hilary Benn asks where Boris Johnson thinks the necessary vaccines will come from to vaccinate the world. G7 leaders pledged last week to provide a billion doses between them in 2022, but the World Health Organization says 11 billion will be needed to vaccinate 70% of the world's population. Boris Johnson says it has only been ""a few months"" since the vaccines were invented, and countries are ""going as fast we can"". He adds that the G7 is committed to vaccinating the world by the end of next year. Conservative chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee Tom Tugendhat asks if the government will commit to informing MPs ahead of time of climate commitments made at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow later this year. Boris Johnson says he will ""do his best to oblige"" what Mr Tugendhat is asking for, but he says his experience is that the House of Commons is not ""a great negotiator"". Conservative Derek Thomas, whose St Ives constituency covers Carbis Bay, where the G7 summit took place, calls it an ""absolutely fantastic event"". He adds that he and his constituents are ""proud of the Carbis Bay declaration"" that followed. The PM says the declaration is fundamental to dealing with the pandemic, setting out timetables for vaccine development. Former Defence Secretary Liam Fox says the G7 ""did Britain proud"" and asks if the Nato summit discussed ways of combating the reliance on Russia for energy by several European countries. The PM says there was discussion on how Nato members could reach an end to the need for hydrocarbons for energy, irrespective of strategic needs. Green MP Caroline Lucas says the failure of the G7 to stop investing in all fossil fuels speaks on the UK's ""climate leadership"". She asks if the UK will pursue a ""global fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty"" as is being called for by 101 Nobel Laureates. Boris Johnson says it was ""groundbreaking"" not to agree to any more overseas coal, and changes ""can be done"". In 2012, he says, 40% of UK power came from coal, it's now down to less than 2% and ""falling the whole time"". Conservative MP Greg Smith asks Boris Johnson whether he remains ""utterly committed"" to the Nato alliance after last week's summit. The prime minister replies Nato ""has protected the world and particularity the European continent"" for 72 years, and it was clear leaders thought it will ""continue to do so for decades to come"".

It cites surveys by bodies such as the Royal College of Nursing (in April and May 2020) showing that a ""significant proportion of participating care workers, doctors and nurses reported having insufficient PPE, even in high-risk settings"". Why some NHS workers are wearing bin bags Dominic Cummings: Five claims fact-checked Matt Hancock: I knew Dominic Cummings wanted PM to sack me It adds that ""government structures were overwhelmed in March 2020"" and that while the government did then set up structures to obtain PPE, that ""it took a long time for it to receive the large volumes of PPE ordered"". There was alsoguidance issued,externalby the government in April 2020 (and since withdrawn) telling front-line staff what they should do to cope with ""acute shortages"" of PPE. Mr Hancock was asked whether failing to test people who were discharged from hospital into care homes early in the first wave, had contributed to the spread of coronavirus there. The 1.6% figure comes froma recently published Public Health England report.,external However, this estimate comes with some major caveats. It is based on positive tests of care home residents but we know that, early on in the pandemic, testing in these settings was limited. So, the analysis misses people who spread the virus but hadn't been tested because they didn't show symptoms, or because there weren't enough tests available. It also misses outbreaks triggered when someone passed it on to a care worker who then did a shift in another home and took the virus there. As Mr Hancock explained, discharges may not have been the main source of care home spread. There were far fewer hospital discharges going into care homes each day than there were staff or visitors, each of whom could have brought in the virus. What did the government do about care homes and coronavirus? But Science and Technology Committee chairman Greg Clark told Mr Hancock it is a ""stretch of the imagination"" to say that the figure is as low as 1.6%, when the data can't properly spot all the seeding events. Mr Hancock was replying to a question about why the government hadn't introduced the lockdown before 23 March 2020. At a government press conference on 9 March 2020, England's Chief Medical Officer Prof Chris Whitty said: ""There is a risk if we go too early people will understandably get fatigued and it will be difficult to sustain this over time."" Buta report from the government's behavioural science advisers,external, SPI-B on 12 March - entitled 'insights on public gatherings' - suggests they thought people would accept restrictions. It notes: ""Expectations of how the Government will react will be set by media reports of public health strategies in other countries. This increases the risk of public concern if interventions that are perceived to be effective are not applied"". In a section on social distancing, the report does say: ""there may be concerns about the sustainability of adherence for difficult behaviours such as entering isolation"". Prof Stephen Reicher, who sits on SPI-B, disputes Mr Hancock's lockdown claim, saying ""it was certainly not the behavioural science advice"". He has pointed to anopen letter from behavioural scientists,externalat the time questioning the evidence for ""behavioural fatigue"". In February 2020, the WHO advised that: ""Travel bans to affected areas or denial of entry to passengers coming from affected areas are usually not effective in preventing the importation of cases, but may have a significant economic and social impact."" This was a recommendation - so non-binding - rather than part of the international health regulations. And a number of countries chose not to follow it. Australia, New Zealand and India almost entirely closed their borders - and it has been noted that they were comparatively well protected during the first wave of Covid. Other countries brought in much more stringent restrictions than the UK, banning entry to all but their citizens or residents, including Singapore, Vietnam, Israel, the Philippines, Taiwan and Argentina. Between January and March 2020, the UK introduced some measures including imposing quarantine on 273 people travelling from Wuhan in China. Others from ""high-risk countries"" including China, Iran and northern Italy were asked to voluntarily isolate for 14 days (though the self-isolation requirements were withdrawn on 13 March). One study found,externalthe virus was introduced to the UK ""well over 1,000 times in early 2020"", with a third of transmission chains brought in from Spain, followed by 29% from France, neither of which faced any restrictions. China accounted for just 0.4% of imported cases. The UKstrengthened its border policyearlier this year. Mr Hancock's claim was interrupted by the former health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, who said that South Korea had not had a lockdown. It's true that South Korea did not implement a national lockdown, but managed to control transmissions by rapidly developing a""test, trace and treat"" system. From 20 February 2020, all symptomatic people were tested, as well as their close contacts (regardless of whether or not they had symptoms). Mass testing was also used in high-risk facilities such as hospitals and care homes, from mid-March. All confirmed cases were either isolated in a hospital, at home, or in a residential treatment centre. South Korea implemented some lockdown measures including moving schools to remote learning in late February 2020 (they gradually reopened in May) and, in a region with a high rate of infections, asking people to refrain from leaving their homes for at least two weeks. South Korea has had a much lower death rate than the UK - 39 confirmeddeaths per one million people,externalcompared with 1,887 in the UK, according to Our World in Data.

Downing Street rejected the claim that Mr Johnson planned to stand down after the next election, saying: ""The PM has actually been asked this before and said it's utter nonsense, so that still stands."" Let's start with a quick political quiz. Q: Who has the safest job in cabinet? A: Matt Hancock Q: Why? A: Because Dominic Cummings wants him sacked. Boris Johnson's spokesman said the PM had full confidence in the health secretary. He could say little else - as he won't be sacking him at the urging of a disgruntled former aide. If he did, that would suggest that Dominic Cummings was right, about what he thinks were failures over PPE, ventilators and testing, early in the pandemic. And if Mr Hancock goes now, Labour would ask why he wasn't dismissed sooner. Mr Cummings makes serious allegations about the handling of the Covid crisis. But by continually suggesting that Matt Hancock is the very personification of government errors, he may be making it a little too easy for his detractors to portray his interventions as a grudge match. And by denouncing not just the Department of Health and Social Care but the Cabinet Office too, you get the impression that Mr Cummings felt that very few people could come up to his standards. Mr Cummings's own credibility, of course, still remains dented due tolast year's lockdown drive to Durham. But his latest dossier does raise questions of ministers well ahead of the formal inquiry, and provides ammunition to an opposition which has questioned the pace at which the government moved. Giving evidence to MPs last week, Mr Hancock said he had seen no evidence to suggest any medical staff had died because of a lack of PPE. In his blog, Mr Cummings accuses the health secretary of trying to blame NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens, Chancellor Rishi Sunak and the Cabinet Office for last April's ""PPE disaster"". ""The lack of PPE killed NHS and care home staff in March-May,"" he writes. He claims Number 10 and Mr Hancock had ""repeatedly lied about the failures last year"" and accuses them of now trying to ""rewrite history"", with the prime minister ""encouraging ministers to give false accounts to Parliament"". Mr Cummings goes on to criticise Mr Johnson's management style. In one section he contrasts Mr Johnson's approach with that of Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who stood in for the PM when he was in hospital with coronavirus. He said meetings with Mr Raab at the helm were ""less pleasant for everybody but much more productive"". He said this was because Mr Raab ""can chair meetings properly instead of telling rambling stories and jokes"". This video can not be played Five things Health Secretary Matt Hancock told MPs He went on to say that ""as soon as things get 'a bit embarrassing' [Boris Johnson] does the whole 'let's take it offline' shtick before shouting 'forward to victory', doing a thumbs-up and pegging it out of the room before anybody can disagree"". Downing Street said it was ""not going to engage"" with this claim. And on Thursday, Treasury minister Jesse Norman told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I think this is some of the biggest nonsense I've heard. ""The prime minister obviously, as anybody would detect, is a massive supporter of the health secretary. ""He's coming firmly behind him. There can be no question of loss of confidence.""

"The UK inflation rate jumped to 2.1% in the year to May, the highest for almost two years, as the easing of lockdown sparked a rise in consumer spending. The Consumer Prices Index measure of inflation rose from 1.5% in April,according to the Office for National Statistics,external, driven by the rising cost of fuel and clothing. The rate is now above the Bank of England's 2% target for inflation. That will fuel the debate about whether it's time to raise interest rates. May's reading was above most economists' forecasts of an increase of about 1.8%. Simply put, inflation is the rate at which prices are rising - if the cost of a Â£1 jar of jam rises by 5p, then jam inflation is 5%. It applies to services too, like having your nails done or getting your car valeted. You may not notice low levels of inflation from month to month, but in the long term, these price rises can have a big impact on how much you can buy with your money. Read more about inflation here. ONS chief economist Grant Fitzner said the biggest single rise was coming from fuel prices, which were falling this time last year as the lockdown started to bite. Petrol and diesel saw a 17.9% price surge over the past year, representing the highest increase for more than four years. Crude oil prices have been increasing over the past few months, which is expected to continue feeding through to pump prices. Clothing prices also increased by 2.3%, the biggest rise since 2018, as retailers significantly reduced their discounting a month after welcoming customers back into stores. The rise in inflation was, however, partly offset by a negative impact from cheaper food and drink prices. Bread, cereals and meat prices all dipped after seeing significant rises a year earlier. Karen Ward, a chief market strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management, told the BBC: ""Consumers have got all these savings they accumulated last year when they weren't allowed out. But supply is really struggling to keep pace, and so what we are seeing therefore is pops of prices in various aspects of the consumer basket."" It certainly was. Most economists were expecting inflation to hit 1.8%, and are now suggesting the rate could rise faster and higher over the next few months than previously thought. JP Morgan's Ms Ward described May's rate as a ""big upside surprise"". And HSBC economist Chris Hare said: ""Whether the upside news proves temporary or persistent, [May's rate] is clearly a hawkish surprise."" The price data was collected on or around May 11, before pubs and restaurants were allowed to serve customers indoors and cinemas and hotels reopened from 17 May. The Bank of England has said it expects inflation to hit 2.5% by the end of this year before settling back to its 2% target as the impact of post-lockdown energy price rises fades along with other cost pressures, such as bottlenecks in supply chains. As you'd expect, economists are divided. Ms Ward said that if inflation pressure was sustained into next year, ""we could see interest rate hikes"" to dampen down rising prices. UK rates, however, remain at historic lows. Also, there are some benefits to rising rates - for example, on the amount of interest people earn on savings. Nevertheless, the low-rate environment that has existed for a decade and upward changes could be a shock for many consumers and businesses. Last week, the Bank of England's chief economist, Andy Haldane, said a rise in inflation above the central bank's target must be only temporary, and that long-term levels of high inflation need to be ""avoided at all costs"". Some economists are concerned that despite rising inflation, governments continue to use stimulus to jump-start their post-Covid economies. Former treasury official Lord Nick Macpherson tweeted on Wednesday that Bank of England policies to control the amount of money in the economy are ""excessively loose"". Lord Macpherson was permanent secretary to three UK chancellors The UK is by no means an isolated case. In the US, where President Joe Biden has proposed a $6 trillion stimulus package, consumer prices hit 5% in May, the highest in almost 13 years. Jack Leslie, an economist at the Resolution Foundation think tank, said the speeding up of UK price growth from 0.3% last November to 2.1% in May represented the fastest six-month rise since sterling collapsed after the 2008-09 financial crisis. ""But UK inflationary pressures are different - and nowhere as near as large - as those causing fierce debate in the US,"" he said. In China, long a source of cheap goods for the world, inflation is also rising - effectively exporting higher prices. And Eurozone inflation rose to 2% in May, the first time the rate has surpassed the European Central Bank's target in more than two years. Nevertheless, central banks seems committed to keeping rates low. The US Fed, for example, expects rates to remain close to zero until 2023. Given the lag between changes in rate policy and the required impact on the economy, some economists worry that central banks could be leaving it too late to change direction. If you think this morning's higher-than-expected inflation number is something to be scared about, the financial markets don't share your view. Traders on foreign currency markets, for example, were unimpressed, with the pound shifting up a modest 0.3% against the euro or 0.2% against the dollar. Inflation may be slightly above the 2% target but it's no higher than it was in July 2019 and well below the 5% inflation of ten years ago, when the global economy was recovering from the 2008 financial crisis. Part of the reason the markets shrugged off the inflation figure is the widespread belief that the upward pressure on prices is temporary. Prices of raw materials such as wood and steel have shot up from a combination of two things - demand after economies re-opened and supplies still coming back up on stream. The result? Shortages and price rises. The confident expectation is that, for example, as steel manufacturers crank up production there'll be more steel to meet demand so its price will fall back, relieving the inflationary pressure. As summer turns to autumn we'll find out if that expectation is justified.

The price data was collected on or around May 11, before pubs and restaurants were allowed to serve customers indoors and cinemas and hotels reopened from 17 May. The Bank of England has said it expects inflation to hit 2.5% by the end of this year before settling back to its 2% target as the impact of post-lockdown energy price rises fades along with other cost pressures, such as bottlenecks in supply chains. As you'd expect, economists are divided. Ms Ward said that if inflation pressure was sustained into next year, ""we could see interest rate hikes"" to dampen down rising prices. UK rates, however, remain at historic lows. Also, there are some benefits to rising rates - for example, on the amount of interest people earn on savings. Nevertheless, the low-rate environment that has existed for a decade and upward changes could be a shock for many consumers and businesses. Last week, the Bank of England's chief economist, Andy Haldane, said a rise in inflation above the central bank's target must be only temporary, and that long-term levels of high inflation need to be ""avoided at all costs"". Some economists are concerned that despite rising inflation, governments continue to use stimulus to jump-start their post-Covid economies. Former treasury official Lord Nick Macpherson tweeted on Wednesday that Bank of England policies to control the amount of money in the economy are ""excessively loose"". Lord Macpherson was permanent secretary to three UK chancellors The UK is by no means an isolated case. In the US, where President Joe Biden has proposed a $6 trillion stimulus package, consumer prices hit 5% in May, the highest in almost 13 years. Jack Leslie, an economist at the Resolution Foundation think tank, said the speeding up of UK price growth from 0.3% last November to 2.1% in May represented the fastest six-month rise since sterling collapsed after the 2008-09 financial crisis. ""But UK inflationary pressures are different - and nowhere as near as large - as those causing fierce debate in the US,"" he said. In China, long a source of cheap goods for the world, inflation is also rising - effectively exporting higher prices. And Eurozone inflation rose to 2% in May, the first time the rate has surpassed the European Central Bank's target in more than two years. Nevertheless, central banks seems committed to keeping rates low. The US Fed, for example, expects rates to remain close to zero until 2023. Given the lag between changes in rate policy and the required impact on the economy, some economists worry that central banks could be leaving it too late to change direction. If you think this morning's higher-than-expected inflation number is something to be scared about, the financial markets don't share your view. Traders on foreign currency markets, for example, were unimpressed, with the pound shifting up a modest 0.3% against the euro or 0.2% against the dollar. Inflation may be slightly above the 2% target but it's no higher than it was in July 2019 and well below the 5% inflation of ten years ago, when the global economy was recovering from the 2008 financial crisis. Part of the reason the markets shrugged off the inflation figure is the widespread belief that the upward pressure on prices is temporary. Prices of raw materials such as wood and steel have shot up from a combination of two things - demand after economies re-opened and supplies still coming back up on stream. The result? Shortages and price rises. The confident expectation is that, for example, as steel manufacturers crank up production there'll be more steel to meet demand so its price will fall back, relieving the inflationary pressure. As summer turns to autumn we'll find out if that expectation is justified.

"Labour leader Keir Starmer has accused the PM of letting the Delta variant in by not toughening rules on travel from India sooner The prime minister said the government took the ""most drastic steps"" to put India on the red list The PM's former aide Dominic Cummings has released a highly critical Whatsapp messages about Matt Hancock which appear to have been written by Mr Johnson Boris Johnson made a statement updating MPs on the outcomes from the G7 and Nato summits MPs will hold a debate later on the government's plans to keep coronavirus restrictions in place until 19 July On Monday, the prime minister announced that the final stage of easing lockdown restrictions in England would be delayed for four weeks Edited by Johanna Howitt BBC Politics Thanks for following along with us this afternoon. The team with you today were Justin Parkinson, Paul Seddon, Richard Morris, and Sinead Wilson. Do join us again next week. As the PM's statement winds down, we're going to close our coverage from the Commons this afternoon. Here's a quick recap of the main points from this week's PMQs and the statement on the G7 and Nato summits Reality Check At PMQs Labour leader Keir Starmer criticised the government over its border policy, arguing that adding India to
the travel restrictions red list on 23 April 2020, had allowed the Delta
variant (which was first identified in India) to spread in the UK. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said:
âWe put India on the red list on 23 April and the Delta variant was not so
identified until 28 April.â Public
Health England declared the Delta variant to be a âvariant under investigationâ
on 28 April, categorising it as a âvariant of concernâ on 6 May. Itâs
worth noting that it had already been designated as a âvariant of
interestâ by theWorld Health Organisation on 4 April,external. And
it was first sequenced in the UK in the week beginning 8 March. You canread more hereabout the

Labour's Christian Matheson raises the so-called ""sausage dispute"" concerning Brexit customs checks in Northern Ireland. He says it shows ""we are miles away"" from free trade agreements outweighing the economic impact of Brexit and we risk alienating our biggest trading partners. The PM says we have a free trade deal with the EU. He says it is a ""fantastic deal"" and out trade with the US is ""growing the whole time"". Lockdown sceptic and Conservative MP,  Mark Harper, says after we have  vaccinated the world to protect people, we need to ""learn to live with what will be an endemic virus"". He asks if the PM  shares his concerns about suggestions in government that  restrictions could come  back in the autumn as cases rise and he asks Mr Johnson to reassure people that will not happen? The prime minister says his objective is to go forward with the roadmap and ""bring back the freedoms we love"". Conservative Laura Trott says she welcomes the PM's focus on gender equality at the G7 and says she notes Keir Starmer did not mention girls or women once in his opening statement. Can the PM come back to the House before 2026 she asks to reassure MPs that progress is being made when it comes to girls' education and ending violence against women. The PM says ""of course"" he will adding the project will be ""scarcely off my lips"" Conservative Tobias Ellwood says the ""rise of China"" technologically means that ""this will be their century"". He says the actions that the UK decides to take in the next few years will ""determine how the next few decades play out"". Boris Johnson says it was ""great to see a summit achieve so much"". Labour's Chi Onwurah says action on tackling tax avoidance from multinationals was ""watered down"" after Boris Johnson didn't back the original US proposal for a minimum 21% corporation tax rate. She says this would have provided an extra Â£15bn for the UK Treasury. The prime minister points out Labour opposed government plans to increase the UK's corporation tax rate from 19% to 25% from 2023 at this year's Budget. He says the deal leaderseventually agreed- to set a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15% - is a ""great achievement"" and a ""great step forward"". Labour MP Florence Eshalomi says girls' education is the best way to lift people out of poverty globally. She asks if there is a ""gaping hole between"" the prime ministers ""words and actions"". Boris Johnson says there was ""massive, overwhelming support"" for girls' education around the world at the G7. He adds that the UK is adding 15% more to education despite the cuts. Labour's Hilary Benn asks where Boris Johnson thinks the necessary vaccines will come from to vaccinate the world. G7 leaders pledged last week to provide a billion doses between them in 2022, but the World Health Organization says 11 billion will be needed to vaccinate 70% of the world's population. Boris Johnson says it has only been ""a few months"" since the vaccines were invented, and countries are ""going as fast we can"". He adds that the G7 is committed to vaccinating the world by the end of next year. Conservative chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee Tom Tugendhat asks if the government will commit to informing MPs ahead of time of climate commitments made at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow later this year. Boris Johnson says he will ""do his best to oblige"" what Mr Tugendhat is asking for, but he says his experience is that the House of Commons is not ""a great negotiator"". Conservative Derek Thomas, whose St Ives constituency covers Carbis Bay, where the G7 summit took place, calls it an ""absolutely fantastic event"". He adds that he and his constituents are ""proud of the Carbis Bay declaration"" that followed. The PM says the declaration is fundamental to dealing with the pandemic, setting out timetables for vaccine development. Former Defence Secretary Liam Fox says the G7 ""did Britain proud"" and asks if the Nato summit discussed ways of combating the reliance on Russia for energy by several European countries. The PM says there was discussion on how Nato members could reach an end to the need for hydrocarbons for energy, irrespective of strategic needs. Green MP Caroline Lucas says the failure of the G7 to stop investing in all fossil fuels speaks on the UK's ""climate leadership"". She asks if the UK will pursue a ""global fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty"" as is being called for by 101 Nobel Laureates. Boris Johnson says it was ""groundbreaking"" not to agree to any more overseas coal, and changes ""can be done"". In 2012, he says, 40% of UK power came from coal, it's now down to less than 2% and ""falling the whole time"". Conservative MP Greg Smith asks Boris Johnson whether he remains ""utterly committed"" to the Nato alliance after last week's summit. The prime minister replies Nato ""has protected the world and particularity the European continent"" for 72 years, and it was clear leaders thought it will ""continue to do so for decades to come"". Conservative Sir Bernard Jenkin says that if peace and stability in Northern Ireland is being undermined by the NI Protocol, then it is obvious it should be re-examined. He asks the PM to consider a different policy. Boris Johnson says that peace and trade in accordance with the Good Friday Agreement ""must be upheld"". He says if this cannot be achieved, he will consider other options. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey says the prime minister's approach of ""do as I say, not as I do"" on aid, democracy and funding global education is ""ruinous"" of the UK's reputation. Boris Johnson replies that the Conservatives have been able to do more good since being in power as a single party, rather than in coalition, ""freed from the shackles of Lib Dem hypocrisy"". Conservative former international development secretary Andrew Mitchell, says the UK is the only major nation which is cutting aid overseas during a pandemic, which will cost lives of women and children. Mitchell has been a vocal critic of the cuts. Boris Johnson says concerns about the aid cuts have not been raised by the recipients in any country which receives aid. He says the UK is still committing Â£10bn this year to supporting countries around the world. Â© 2025 BBC.

"The UK inflation rate jumped to 2.1% in the year to May, the highest for almost two years, as the easing of lockdown sparked a rise in consumer spending. The Consumer Prices Index measure of inflation rose from 1.5% in April,according to the Office for National Statistics,external, driven by the rising cost of fuel and clothing. The rate is now above the Bank of England's 2% target for inflation. That will fuel the debate about whether it's time to raise interest rates. May's reading was above most economists' forecasts of an increase of about 1.8%. Simply put, inflation is the rate at which prices are rising - if the cost of a Â£1 jar of jam rises by 5p, then jam inflation is 5%. It applies to services too, like having your nails done or getting your car valeted. You may not notice low levels of inflation from month to month, but in the long term, these price rises can have a big impact on how much you can buy with your money. Read more about inflation here. ONS chief economist Grant Fitzner said the biggest single rise was coming from fuel prices, which were falling this time last year as the lockdown started to bite. Petrol and diesel saw a 17.9% price surge over the past year, representing the highest increase for more than four years. Crude oil prices have been increasing over the past few months, which is expected to continue feeding through to pump prices. Clothing prices also increased by 2.3%, the biggest rise since 2018, as retailers significantly reduced their discounting a month after welcoming customers back into stores. The rise in inflation was, however, partly offset by a negative impact from cheaper food and drink prices. Bread, cereals and meat prices all dipped after seeing significant rises a year earlier. Karen Ward, a chief market strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management, told the BBC: ""Consumers have got all these savings they accumulated last year when they weren't allowed out. But supply is really struggling to keep pace, and so what we are seeing therefore is pops of prices in various aspects of the consumer basket."" It certainly was. Most economists were expecting inflation to hit 1.8%, and are now suggesting the rate could rise faster and higher over the next few months than previously thought. JP Morgan's Ms Ward described May's rate as a ""big upside surprise"". And HSBC economist Chris Hare said: ""Whether the upside news proves temporary or persistent, [May's rate] is clearly a hawkish surprise.""

"The pandemic has changed the way we pay for things Consumers kept their cash and cards in their pockets last year, as lockdowns cut the number of payments made for the first time in six years, banks say. More than eight out of 10 payments by consumers are spontaneous but options were limited by the Covid crisis. The total number of payments was down on the previous year, but when people did spend money they were increasingly likely to use contactless technology. Covid concerns meant shoppers were encouraged to use it instead of cash. Contactless technology allows consumers to place their debit or credit card, or smartphone, near a trader's terminal to pay for things, without needing to enter a four-digit pin. Of the payments that were made last year, an increasing proportion were via contactless cards, banking trade body UK Finance said. The contactless limit was hurriedly raised at the start of the pandemic to Â£45 per use, from Â£30. Ministers are planning to allow thatlimit to be increased to Â£100later this year. UK inflation jumps in May as lockdown eases Saving cash: A customer said we'd changed her life Bank of England to consider digital money plan The total number of payments made by consumers last year fell by 13% compared to the previous year, to 31 billion, according to the UK Finance report. Contactless payments accounted for 27% of these transactions. They were most commonly made in supermarkets, although these were among the relatively small list of outlets which were able to remain open throughout the pandemic. Nine out of 10 people shopped online and they were increasingly likely to spend via this method during lockdowns. Payments made via smartphones and other digital devices also increased, primarily among the younger generations. In contrast, cash use fell. The number of payments made with notes and coins dropped by 35%. This continued a trend of recent years, but also reflected the reduced opportunities to pay for things during lockdowns. It still accounted for 17% of all payments, making it the second most-popular way to pay behind debit cards. ""While it is still too early to say if this is a permanent change to people's behaviour as, in many other parts of people's lives, the pandemic has also affected UK payment markets,"" the report said.

"Joe Biden gave his assessment of his meeting with Vladimir Putin in Geneva He said the talks were ""positive"" but warned the US would not tolerate interference in US democracy Putin described his talks with the US president as ""constructive"" He said the two sides agreed to return ambassadors after they were withdrawn earlier this year A wide range of topics, from cyber-attacks to Ukraine were discussed, but little in the way of concrete deals The meeting in Geneva was their first since Biden became president and was closely watched All times are GMT (BST-1) Edited by Jessica Murphy, Toby Luckhurst and Paul Kirby Thanks for tuning in to todayâs live coverage of the Biden
and Putin summit. Here are some of the key points from today:  Sophie Williams, David Walker and Holly
Honderich were our writing team today. The live page was edited by Paul Kirby, Toby Luckhurst and Jessica
Murphy. While the presidential plane waited to leave Geneva, President Biden took questions from reporters who were pressing him on what he had achieved during the Putin meeting. ""To be a journalist you have to have a negative world view, it seems,"" Biden said, chiding reporters for ""never"" asking a positive question. Pushed over whether or not he accomplished anything, he responds ""we will see"". Over the audible pleas of the president's team asking reporters to wrap up the questions, Biden continued to speak with them and defend his position with Putin. Biden apologised for being ""short"" and a ""wise guy"" to reporters, who he then called ""the brightest people in the country"". Vladimir Putin's two-decade reign as either president or prime minister of Russia has overlapped with the terms of five US presidents. Here's a look back at his meetings with the four who came before Joe Biden: Bill Clinton, George Bush, Barack Obama and Donald Trump. Putin and Bill Clinton met in 2000 in New York City George W Bush meanwhile met with Putin at his vacation home in 2008 Putin and President Obama shook hands for the cameras at a bilateral meeting at the UN headquarters in New York And President Donald Trump was photographed greeting Putin at the G20 Osaka Summit in 2019 Biden is known for his love of sunglasses President Biden gave his Russian counterpart two gifts at the summit, according to the White House. The first was a crystal sculpture of a US bison - ""one of our nation's most majestic mammals and representative of strength, unity, resilience"", a statement read. He also gave President Putin a pair of sunglasses - ""custom Aviators"". Biden is known for sporting Aviator sunglasses and has been photographed in the iconic shades many times. Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News A ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline in the US caused a surge of panic buying At least in public, the two leaders set out familiar
positions a world-apart. The US says Russia has carried out aggressive
cyber-espionage and sheltered criminalsattacking US infrastructure with ransomware.
But President Putin responded by suggesting most attacks in cyber-space come
from America and elsewhere. The US ambition for this meeting was to set out red lines
and President Biden suggested he did just that - saying he listed 16 sectors of
critical infrastructure that should be off-limits to attacks. He
said heâd also asked Putin how he would feel if Russiaâs oil
infrastructure was disrupted in the way that US fuel supplies were. This was no
threat, merely to make a point, he appeared to be saying. But he also pointed
out that Moscow knows the US has ""significant"" cyber capability - a clear
warning. Perhaps most significantly, Biden said the two
sides agreed to set up a working group to develop specific understandings in
cyber space and  follow up on specific cases. âAre they going to act? We
are going to find out,â he said. So rhetoric, warnings, denials and
red lines were all there as expected - but also the possibility of a route to
some kind of better understanding with the caution that this may or not
work.  In keeping with the two presidents' shared script of a ""cooperative"" meeting today, Putin and Biden have released a joint statement. The two countries have proven they are able to make progress on shared goals ""even in periods of tension"", they said. Russian-American cooperation helps reduce the threat of our own conflicts, and the threat of nuclear war, Putin and Biden said.  After a mostly congenial tone, Biden's post-Putin press conference ended in a flurry of confusion. Putting on his aviator sunglasses and making moves to leave, Biden continued to field questions as he walked off the stage. Journalists probed Biden on what concrete action he had managed to elicit from Putin, pointing to the Russian leader's defensiveness on human rights questions earlier today. Becoming visibly irritated, Biden walked back over to reporters, shaking his head at their questions. Asked why Biden was confident that Putin would change his behaviour after false promises in the past, the US president retorted: ""If you donât understand that, youâre in the wrong business."" Earlier, there was confusion after President Biden nodded when a reporter asked if he trusted President Putin. The White House issued a denial, saying he was ""clearly not responding to any one question, but nodding in acknowledgement to the press generally."" Asked at the news conference again about whether he could trust Putin, Biden said this was ""not about trust"". ""This
is about self interest and verification of self interest,"" he said. He said it was best to wait and see what happened, quoting an old saying. ""The proof of the pudding is in the eating. Weâre going to
know shortly,"" he said. This video can not be played Putin and Biden summit: Ongoing relations about 'mutual self-interest' When asked about restricted political freedoms in Russia, Putin pointed to the 6 January riots at the US Capitol, saying he didn't want that sort of chaos to happen in Russia. Asked about those remarks at his own news conference, Joe Biden laughed and said it was a ""ridiculous comparison"". On one hand, Biden said, you have ""criminals"" trying to take hold of the US Capitol. In Russia, you have people peacefully objecting, people who are not allowed to speak freely, he added. Petr KozlovBBC Russia First thing to point out is that the meeting lasted less
than what was originally announced - less than five hours. Second, just a few
minutes after the end of the negotiations, Vladimir Putin came out to
journalists and made a number of harsh statements - about the situation in
Ukraine, the situation with the opposition in Russia, saying that the actions
of the Russian authorities are no different from the actions of authorities in the US. On the whole, Vladimir Putin's press conference was largely a repetition
of what the Russian president has been saying for many years. The only new
element was perhaps stating that some restoration of diplomatic bodies is
possible, and that an exchange of citizens, convicted and imprisoned in Russia
and the United States, respectively, is possible.  This video can not be played Biden to Putin: I'm not against Russia or anyone else In his first question from reporters, President Biden is asked what he has done to prevent Russian election interference in the future. ""Whether I have stopped [election interference], Putin knows there will be consequences,"" Biden says. Russia is ""desperately trying to maintain its standing"" as a world power, Biden says. Losing this status will be ""the price they pay"" for continued interference. ""They are not able to dictate what happens in the world,"" he says. The same applies if Alexei Navalny dies. The consequences to Russia would be devastating, Biden says. Finishing his opening remarks, Biden said it was ""important to meet in
person so there could be no mistake about"" his intentions. ""I did what I came to do. Number one: identify areas of
practical work our two countries can do to advance our mutual interests and
also benefit the world. Two: Communicate directly, directly, that the US will
respond to actions that impair our vital interests or those of our allies. And
three, to clearly lay out our countryâs priorities and our values so he heard it
straight from me,"" he said. ""And I must tell you the tone of the entire meetings â I guess
it was a total of four hours â was good, positive,"" he said. ""There wasnât any strident
action taken."" Biden, like Putin, addresses cybersecurity early on, saying that the US identified certain cyber infrastructures that are ""off limits"". The US defined 16 such sites, defined as critical infrastructure. Russia agreed in principle, Biden says. But ""principle is one thing, it has to be backed up by practice"".  President Biden starts off with a firm but conciliatory tone. ""Where we have
differences I want President Putin to understand why I say what I say and why I
do what I do,"" Biden says. ""I
told President Putin my agenda is not against Russia or anyone else, itâs for
the American people,"" he said. Human rights ""are who we are"" as Americans, Biden says. They will ""always be on the table"". After President Putin's nearly hour-long press conference, his American counterpart is up now. President Joe Biden has taken the podium and is poised for questions. Vitaliy ShevchenkoBBC Monitoring Russian ambassador Anatoly Antonov will return to Washington

journalists in Geneva, according to Interfax news agency. He was speaking after President Vladimir Putin told a news
conference after talks with US President Joe Biden that the ambassadors will be
restored. ""We have agreed that this issue has been
resolved,"" Putin said. ""They are returning to the places of
their permanent service. As to when exactly, tomorrow or the day after, that is
a purely technical issue,"" he said. We just heard from President Putin as he addressed journalists for nearly an hour. President Joe Biden should be up next - journalists in Geneva say he could take the stage any moment. Sarah RainsfordBBC Moscow Correspondent Speaking on BBC News Channel. Vladimir Putin was keen to spin a positive line on what happened. He
was quite warm, in fact, in talking about Joe Biden. One thing that stood out was how he said they had spoken eye to eye
for almost two hours. Itâs not every world leader you can do that with in such
detailed talks, he said. These were substantive, important, constructive talks, he stressed,
and there were a few points at which they managed to move the relationship
forward. They agreed to return ambassadors - without ambassadors itâs difficult
to see how you can talk about any kind of diplomatic relationship. There is an
agreement that the foreign ministers will look into the possible release and swap
of high-profile prisoners, both in Russia and the US, and consultations will be
held on strategic security. Vladimir Putin was keen to underline several times that Russia was a
nuclear power. It is an important country, yes its economy is far smaller than
the US, but it is a nuclear power and does matter. And thatâs why Joe Biden, in
Putinâs eyes, came to talk to him. During the press conference, the BBC's Steve Rosenberg asked about Russian ""unpredictability"", which he said the west believes is ""an inherent trait of the
Russian policy."" ""Are you ready to forego instability to improve?"" he asked the Russian President. It's clear that Putin was not a big fan of the question. ""You said the west believes that Russian policy is
unpredictable, well let me reciprocate. The US withdrawal from the ABM treaty
in 2002 was unpredictable. Why would they do that? ""Then disrupt and undermine
the basis of the strategic stability, the INF treaty withdrawal in 2019, is that
what you call stability, the open skies agreement withdrawal, well, is that what
you call stability? Thereâs almost no legs to stand on,"" he said. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.9980806
"The pandemic has changed the way we pay for things Consumers kept their cash and cards in their pockets last year, as lockdowns cut the number of payments made for the first time in six years, banks say. More than eight out of 10 payments by consumers are spontaneous but options were limited by the Covid crisis. The total number of payments was down on the previous year, but when people did spend money they were increasingly likely to use contactless technology. Covid concerns meant shoppers were encouraged to use it instead of cash. Contactless technology allows consumers to place their debit or credit card, or smartphone, near a trader's terminal to pay for things, without needing to enter a four-digit pin. Of the payments that were made last year, an increasing proportion were via contactless cards, banking trade body UK Finance said. The contactless limit was hurriedly raised at the start of the pandemic to Â£45 per use, from Â£30. Ministers are planning to allow thatlimit to be increased to Â£100later this year. UK inflation jumps in May as lockdown eases Saving cash: A customer said we'd changed her life Bank of England to consider digital money plan The total number of payments made by consumers last year fell by 13% compared to the previous year, to 31 billion, according to the UK Finance report. Contactless payments accounted for 27% of these transactions. They were most commonly made in supermarkets, although these were among the relatively small list of outlets which were able to remain open throughout the pandemic. Nine out of 10 people shopped online and they were increasingly likely to spend via this method during lockdowns. Payments made via smartphones and other digital devices also increased, primarily among the younger generations. In contrast, cash use fell. The number of payments made with notes and coins dropped by 35%. This continued a trend of recent years, but also reflected the reduced opportunities to pay for things during lockdowns. It still accounted for 17% of all payments, making it the second most-popular way to pay behind debit cards. ""While it is still too early to say if this is a permanent change to people's behaviour as, in many other parts of people's lives, the pandemic has also affected UK payment markets,"" the report said.

"Joe Biden gave his assessment of his meeting with Vladimir Putin in Geneva He said the talks were ""positive"" but warned the US would not tolerate interference in US democracy Putin described his talks with the US president as ""constructive"" He said the two sides agreed to return ambassadors after they were withdrawn earlier this year A wide range of topics, from cyber-attacks to Ukraine were discussed, but little in the way of concrete deals The meeting in Geneva was their first since Biden became president and was closely watched All times are GMT (BST-1) Edited by Jessica Murphy, Toby Luckhurst and Paul Kirby Thanks for tuning in to todayâs live coverage of the Biden
and Putin summit. Here are some of the key points from today:  Sophie Williams, David Walker and Holly
Honderich were our writing team today. The live page was edited by Paul Kirby, Toby Luckhurst and Jessica
Murphy. While the presidential plane waited to leave Geneva, President Biden took questions from reporters who were pressing him on what he had achieved during the Putin meeting. ""To be a journalist you have to have a negative world view, it seems,"" Biden said, chiding reporters for ""never"" asking a positive question. Pushed over whether or not he accomplished anything, he responds ""we will see"". Over the audible pleas of the president's team asking reporters to wrap up the questions, Biden continued to speak with them and defend his position with Putin. Biden apologised for being ""short"" and a ""wise guy"" to reporters, who he then called ""the brightest people in the country"". Vladimir Putin's two-decade reign as either president or prime minister of Russia has overlapped with the terms of five US presidents. Here's a look back at his meetings with the four who came before Joe Biden: Bill Clinton, George Bush, Barack Obama and Donald Trump. Putin and Bill Clinton met in 2000 in New York City George W Bush meanwhile met with Putin at his vacation home in 2008 Putin and President Obama shook hands for the cameras at a bilateral meeting at the UN headquarters in New York And President Donald Trump was photographed greeting Putin at the G20 Osaka Summit in 2019 Biden is known for his love of sunglasses President Biden gave his Russian counterpart two gifts at the summit, according to the White House. The first was a crystal sculpture of a US bison - ""one of our nation's most majestic mammals and representative of strength, unity, resilience"", a statement read. He also gave President Putin a pair of sunglasses - ""custom Aviators"". Biden is known for sporting Aviator sunglasses and has been photographed in the iconic shades many times. Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News A ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline in the US caused a surge of panic buying At least in public, the two leaders set out familiar
positions a world-apart. The US says Russia has carried out aggressive
cyber-espionage and sheltered criminalsattacking US infrastructure with ransomware.
But President Putin responded by suggesting most attacks in cyber-space come
from America and elsewhere. The US ambition for this meeting was to set out red lines
and President Biden suggested he did just that - saying he listed 16 sectors of
critical infrastructure that should be off-limits to attacks. He
said heâd also asked Putin how he would feel if Russiaâs oil
infrastructure was disrupted in the way that US fuel supplies were. This was no
threat, merely to make a point, he appeared to be saying. But he also pointed
out that Moscow knows the US has ""significant"" cyber capability - a clear
warning. Perhaps most significantly, Biden said the two
sides agreed to set up a working group to develop specific understandings in
cyber space and  follow up on specific cases. âAre they going to act? We
are going to find out,â he said. So rhetoric, warnings, denials and
red lines were all there as expected - but also the possibility of a route to
some kind of better understanding with the caution that this may or not
work.  In keeping with the two presidents' shared script of a ""cooperative"" meeting today, Putin and Biden have released a joint statement. The two countries have proven they are able to make progress on shared goals ""even in periods of tension"", they said. Russian-American cooperation helps reduce the threat of our own conflicts, and the threat of nuclear war, Putin and Biden said.  After a mostly congenial tone, Biden's post-Putin press conference ended in a flurry of confusion. Putting on his aviator sunglasses and making moves to leave, Biden continued to field questions as he walked off the stage. Journalists probed Biden on what concrete action he had managed to elicit from Putin, pointing to the Russian leader's defensiveness on human rights questions earlier today. Becoming visibly irritated, Biden walked back over to reporters, shaking his head at their questions. Asked why Biden was confident that Putin would change his behaviour after false promises in the past, the US president retorted: ""If you donât understand that, youâre in the wrong business."" Earlier, there was confusion after President Biden nodded when a reporter asked if he trusted President Putin. The White House issued a denial, saying he was ""clearly not responding to any one question, but nodding in acknowledgement to the press generally."" Asked at the news conference again about whether he could trust Putin, Biden said this was ""not about trust"". ""This
is about self interest and verification of self interest,"" he said. He said it was best to wait and see what happened, quoting an old saying. ""The proof of the pudding is in the eating. Weâre going to
know shortly,"" he said. This video can not be played Putin and Biden summit: Ongoing relations about 'mutual self-interest' When asked about restricted political freedoms in Russia, Putin pointed to the 6 January riots at the US Capitol, saying he didn't want that sort of chaos to happen in Russia. Asked about those remarks at his own news conference, Joe Biden laughed and said it was a ""ridiculous comparison"". On one hand, Biden said, you have ""criminals"" trying to take hold of the US Capitol. In Russia, you have people peacefully objecting, people who are not allowed to speak freely, he added. Petr KozlovBBC Russia First thing to point out is that the meeting lasted less
than what was originally announced - less than five hours. Second, just a few
minutes after the end of the negotiations, Vladimir Putin came out to
journalists and made a number of harsh statements - about the situation in
Ukraine, the situation with the opposition in Russia, saying that the actions
of the Russian authorities are no different from the actions of authorities in the US. On the whole, Vladimir Putin's press conference was largely a repetition
of what the Russian president has been saying for many years. The only new
element was perhaps stating that some restoration of diplomatic bodies is
possible, and that an exchange of citizens, convicted and imprisoned in Russia
and the United States, respectively, is possible.  This video can not be played Biden to Putin: I'm not against Russia or anyone else In his first question from reporters, President Biden is asked what he has done to prevent Russian election interference in the future. ""Whether I have stopped [election interference], Putin knows there will be consequences,"" Biden says. Russia is ""desperately trying to maintain its standing"" as a world power, Biden says. Losing this status will be ""the price they pay"" for continued interference. ""They are not able to dictate what happens in the world,"" he says. The same applies if Alexei Navalny dies. The consequences to Russia would be devastating, Biden says. Finishing his opening remarks, Biden said it was ""important to meet in
person so there could be no mistake about"" his intentions. ""I did what I came to do. Number one: identify areas of
practical work our two countries can do to advance our mutual interests and
also benefit the world. Two: Communicate directly, directly, that the US will
respond to actions that impair our vital interests or those of our allies. And
three, to clearly lay out our countryâs priorities and our values so he heard it
straight from me,"" he said. ""And I must tell you the tone of the entire meetings â I guess
it was a total of four hours â was good, positive,"" he said. ""There wasnât any strident
action taken."" Biden, like Putin, addresses cybersecurity early on, saying that the US identified certain cyber infrastructures that are ""off limits"". The US defined 16 such sites, defined as critical infrastructure. Russia agreed in principle, Biden says. But ""principle is one thing, it has to be backed up by practice"".  President Biden starts off with a firm but conciliatory tone. ""Where we have
differences I want President Putin to understand why I say what I say and why I
do what I do,"" Biden says. ""I
told President Putin my agenda is not against Russia or anyone else, itâs for
the American people,"" he said. Human rights ""are who we are"" as Americans, Biden says. They will ""always be on the table"". After President Putin's nearly hour-long press conference, his American counterpart is up now. President Joe Biden has taken the podium and is poised for questions. Vitaliy ShevchenkoBBC Monitoring Russian ambassador Anatoly Antonov will return to Washington

What Putin really wants from Biden In pictures: A history of US-Russian summits The meeting comes on the tail end of Mr Biden's first foreign trip as US president, in which he has also attended meetings with G7 and Nato leaders.

The choice of Geneva as the setting harks back to the Cold War summit between US President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in 1985. Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbatchev met in Geneva in 1985 Neither the US nor Russia currently has an ambassador in-country, and Russia recently included the US on its official list of ""unfriendly states"". However, Mr Biden has said the meeting is an important step if they are to ultimately find ""stability and predictability"" in relations, while Mr Putin told state TV there were ""issues where we can work together"". But Yuri Ushakov, Mr Putin's foreign affairs adviser, told journalists there was ""not much"" ground for optimism, while Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the talks would be ""very difficult"". Meanwhile, asked if the leaders - who previously met while Mr Biden was vice-president - would share a meal together, one senior US official told AFP news agency: ""There will be no breaking of bread."" This video can not be played Joe Biden said he hoped to cooperate with Vladimir Putin - and described him as ""a worthy adversary"" The US and Russian flags are out in Geneva, armed police in speed boats are patrolling the waterfront and a lakeside beach has been shut to sunbathers opposite the quietly stylish Swiss mansion that will host this summit. It won't be a friendly affair: how could it be, when Joe Biden has called Vladimir Putin a killer and claims he has no soul? In return, Russian TV reports on the meeting today opened by praising the elderly US leader for making it down the stairs of his plane without falling. There is plenty to discuss, and potentially cooperate on - from arms control to cybersecurity, the new battleground. The US also has a long list of concerns to raise about Russia's ""malign activity"" abroad and human rights at home. Vladimir Putin will shrug them off - he has years of practice at that. There are hints of possible progress in talks on the fate of US prisoners in Russia, including the former US marine Paul Whelan, convicted of espionage: Moscow has long been pushing for a swap for its own high-profile detainees in America. A truce in the long-running ""diplomatic war"" is also possible, with ambassadors perhaps finally returning to their posts. This encounter will produce no ""reset"" in relations, the hostility is here to stay. But it is a chance for the leaders of two nuclear powers to look each other in the eye again - to be frank - and to set out their respective stalls. At the very least, it's a chance to stop things getting any worse. Diplomacy:The two sides are expected to discuss the withdrawal of their ambassadors, who returned home amid the heightened tensions. The US has expelled dozens of Russian diplomats and shut down two compounds in recent years, while US missions in Russia are to be barred from employing locals, meaning dramatic cuts in services including visas Arms control:Officials also believe there could be common ground on arms control. In February, the countriesextended their New Start nuclear arms control treaty. Russia wants this to be further extended Cyber-attacks:Mr Biden is expected to raise concerns over recent cyber-attacks that the US has linked to Russia-based hackers. Mr Putin has denied Russian involvement Elections:The issue of alleged Russian interference in US elections is also likely to come up. Again, Mr Putin denies this Prisoners:The families of two former US marines who are being held in Russian prisons have pressed for their release ahead of the summit. Asked if he would be willing to negotiate on a prisoner swap, Mr Putin told NBC News ""of course"" Navalny:The Russian side has called the alleged poisoning and imprisonment ofopposition leader Alexei Navalnyan internal political matter. But a senior US official told AP news agency there is ""no issue that is off the table for the president"" Ukraine:Relations with the US deteriorated when Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimean peninsula in 2014. There have been warnings this year ofa build-up of Russian troops in Crimea and near Ukraine's border,sparking concerns of preparations for war. Mr Putin has also baulked recently at the idea of Ukrainian membership of Nato Syria:Mr Biden is expected to appeal to Russia not to close the only remaining UN aid corridor from Turkey into opposition-held northwest Syria. A vote on re-authorising the corridor will be held by the UN Security Council, where Russia - which supports Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad - has veto power What do young Americans admire about Russia?

"Thomas, who took his letter to Downing Street with his mum, says his brother means ""everything"" to him The brother of a severely epileptic boy has hand-delivered a letter to Downing Street urging the prime minister to help get a medical cannabis prescription for his sibling. Thomas Braun, nine, told Boris Johnson his parents should not have the ""added worry of having to find lots of money to pay for his medicine"". His younger brother Eddie can suffer up to 100 seizures a day. Medicinal cannabiscan be prescribedon the NHS in ""exceptional"" cases. The treatment was made legal with a prescription in 2018 for those with an ""exceptional clinical need"". But since then only three NHS prescriptions have been issued, forcing families to spend thousands on private treatments. Eddie's family from Farndon, Cheshire, spend almost Â£800 ($990) a month on his medical cannabis medication which they say is ""life-transforming"". Thomas, who said his brother means ""everything"" to him, asked the prime minister to help his parents ""and the other mums and dads"" who have to fundraise each month to meet the medical bills. He wrote: ""My mum and dad love us both, and they have to help Eddie a lot and sometimes I have to help too. ""They have the added worry of having to find lots of money to pay for his medicine. ""Lots of our friends help. But getting the medicine from the government without having to do lots of things to find the money would help them a lot."" Eddie can suffer up to 100 seizures a day Thomas said he ""felt nervous"" delivering the letter to Downing Street but he said ""it was also very exciting, because this is my chance to actually help change my brother's life and my family's life"". His mother Ilmarie Braun said ""you have to fight for access to everything"" for children who have complex needs. ""A school place, adaptations at home, the right wheelchair, to then try to manage Eddie's medication needs, that's just beyond what's reasonable,"" she said. Hannah Deacon, whose son Alfie Dingley was thefirst UK patient given a long-term licence for medicinal cannabison the NHS in June 2018, has also raised concerns in a letter to the prime minister. She said unless the situation changed ""we will remain forever stuck with access blocked for very poorly children who are either left suffering unnecessarily, forced to pay thousands of pounds privately or even more worrying drawn to the black market"". Ms Deacon, of Kenilworth, Warwickshire, said ""desperate parents"" were being forced to purchase ""dangerous products"" and were treating their children with substandard, illegal products. Alfie Dingley secured a long-term licence for medicinal cannabis on the NHS in 2018 She said it was estimated more than 1,000 UK families were accessing black market products, but the number may be much higher. Ms Deacon, said nine-year-old Alfie's life had been transformed by taking medical cannabis. Alfie, who has a severe, rare form of epilepsy, previously had ""absolutely no quality of life"", suffering up to 150 seizures a month and she said caring for him was ""harrowing"". Alfie, who was prescribed Bedrolite oil, has been seizure-free for over a year, she said. Peter Carroll, from campaign group End Our Pain, said the situation was ""bizarre and cruel"" as the government ""legalised a medicine, but hardly anyone can get it"". A spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Social Care said licensed cannabis-based medicines were ""funded by the NHS where there is clear evidence of their safety and clinical effectiveness"". She said specialist doctors could now prescribe ""unlicensed cannabis-based products for medicinal use where it is clinically appropriate and in the best interests of patients"".

At the very least, it's a chance to stop things getting any worse. Diplomacy:The two sides are expected to discuss the withdrawal of their ambassadors, who returned home amid the heightened tensions. The US has expelled dozens of Russian diplomats and shut down two compounds in recent years, while US missions in Russia are to be barred from employing locals, meaning dramatic cuts in services including visas Arms control:Officials also believe there could be common ground on arms control. In February, the countriesextended their New Start nuclear arms control treaty. Russia wants this to be further extended Cyber-attacks:Mr Biden is expected to raise concerns over recent cyber-attacks that the US has linked to Russia-based hackers. Mr Putin has denied Russian involvement Elections:The issue of alleged Russian interference in US elections is also likely to come up. Again, Mr Putin denies this Prisoners:The families of two former US marines who are being held in Russian prisons have pressed for their release ahead of the summit. Asked if he would be willing to negotiate on a prisoner swap, Mr Putin told NBC News ""of course"" Navalny:The Russian side has called the alleged poisoning and imprisonment ofopposition leader Alexei Navalnyan internal political matter. But a senior US official told AP news agency there is ""no issue that is off the table for the president"" Ukraine:Relations with the US deteriorated when Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimean peninsula in 2014. There have been warnings this year ofa build-up of Russian troops in Crimea and near Ukraine's border,sparking concerns of preparations for war. Mr Putin has also baulked recently at the idea of Ukrainian membership of Nato Syria:Mr Biden is expected to appeal to Russia not to close the only remaining UN aid corridor from Turkey into opposition-held northwest Syria.

"The UK risks being left in the slow lane when it comes to building electric cars, according to a new report. Influential green group Transport and Environment (T&E) says as recently as 2018, the UK produced roughly half of all electric cars built in Europe. But it claims a lack of investment by UK manufacturers means that by the end of the decade that figure will have fallen to just 4%. This comes at a time when the market is expanding rapidly. As a result, the Brussels-based campaign group says that, despite being one of the first countries to outlaw the sale of new petrol and diesel cars, the UK will be almost wholly reliant on electric vehicles imported from abroad. Europe tools up against US and Asia as a car battery force Why electric cars will take over sooner than you think Â£300m investment to fuel electric car take-up The market for electric cars remains relatively small, but it is growing rapidly, largely due to increasingly stringent emissions limits. A number of European governments have already set targets for phasing out the sale of new petrol and diesel-powered vehicles, in their efforts to meet climate change targets. The UK, which plans to ban the sale of most new cars with internal combustion engines by 2030, is among the most ambitious. But according to the study by T&E, manufacturers based here are among the worst prepared for the change. T&E's report is based on information compiled by industry data specialist IHS Markit, including the carmakers' own market and production forecasts. It concludes that by 2030, battery-powered electric cars will account for 48% of production across the 27 countries of the EU and the UK. Plug-in hybrids will make up 11%. However, it suggests that the difference in the way manufacturers have approached the transition means that the balance of power in the industry is expected to change. Germany is currently in the lead when it comes to producing electric cars Germany is expected to remain the dominant car producer in Europe. By 2030, its output is expected to increase from 4.5 million cars a year to 5.1 million - with half of them being electric. But the UK, it says, will see output fall from its pre-Covid level of 1.3 million cars a year to just 1 million - and only 24% are expected to be battery-powered electric vehicles. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), which represents the automobile industry, strongly refutes T&E's conclusions. ""The accusation that UK car makers are not preparing for the shift to electrification is utter nonsense,"" SMMT's chief executive Mike Hawes told the BBC. ""The UK was home to the first mass-produced electric vehicle in Europe, almost one in four cars made here this year have been either battery electric or hybrid, and British brands have publicly committed to be amongst the first anywhere to be fully electric."" He added that independent forecasts showed the UK was ramping up its production of electric vehicles and that it would be able to meet the government's net zero 2030 ambitions. ""However, our ability to realise this opportunity still depends on the inherent competitiveness of the UK as a place to invest,"" he stressed. ""The UK-EU trading rules will help but success will depend on greater backing for advanced manufacturing; reducing operating costs, investing in workforce skills and the maintenance of a healthy new car market."" According to T&E, among the manufacturers with facilities in the UK, Toyota is ""least prepared for the electrification revolution that is under way"". This, the group says, is because of the Japanese company's plans to continue building hybrid cars at its factory in Derbyshire. Rather controversially, it describes hybrids as ""a 25 year-old outdated technology"". Toyota has frequently defended its focus on hybrids in the past, saying it ""believes it is better to maintain an open regulatory framework towards carbon neutrality and not limit possible technology solutions too early"". T&E has criticised hybrid cars as being ""outdated technology"" The organisation is also critical of Jaguar Land Rover and BMW, owner of the Mini brand. It says Stellantis, which owns Vauxhall, ""is better prepared to transition to electric cars but is focusing new electric car production in EU countries"". It is worth pointing out, however, that Stellantis is still in talks with the government over the future of its plant at Ellesmere Port in Cheshire, which could lead to electric cars being built at the site. The report also accepts that BMW's plans to turn Mini into an all-electric brand could affect the forecasts it uses for UK production. Nissan, meanwhile, is widely reported to have plans to expand battery production at its base in Sunderland, with the construction of a new ""gigafactory"". But according to T&E, the plan - which would initially see the plant having a capacity of 6.5 Gigawatt hours (GWh), this amounts to ""a tiny fraction of the 474GWh of production at 17 sites across Europe for which funding has already been secured"". It adds: ""A further 10 gigafactory projects (including BritishVolt) have been announced, which would take total cell production to over 1000GWh"". But it claims these projects are unlikely to go ahead unless the government puts more pressure on carmakers. Without strong pressure to change, it says ""the UK car industry will wither away"". A government spokesperson said: ""The UK will continue to be one of the best locations in the world for automotive manufacturing through a major government investment programme of up to Â£1bn to support the electrification of the auto supply chain, including the development of gigafactories in the UK.""

"The UK inflation rate jumped to 2.1% in the year to May, the highest for almost two years, as the easing of lockdown sparked a rise in consumer spending. The Consumer Prices Index measure of inflation rose from 1.5% in April,according to the Office for National Statistics,external, driven by the rising cost of fuel and clothing. The rate is now above the Bank of England's 2% target for inflation. That will fuel the debate about whether it's time to raise interest rates. May's reading was above most economists' forecasts of an increase of about 1.8%. Simply put, inflation is the rate at which prices are rising - if the cost of a Â£1 jar of jam rises by 5p, then jam inflation is 5%. It applies to services too, like having your nails done or getting your car valeted. You may not notice low levels of inflation from month to month, but in the long term, these price rises can have a big impact on how much you can buy with your money. Read more about inflation here. ONS chief economist Grant Fitzner said the biggest single rise was coming from fuel prices, which were falling this time last year as the lockdown started to bite. Petrol and diesel saw a 17.9% price surge over the past year, representing the highest increase for more than four years. Crude oil prices have been increasing over the past few months, which is expected to continue feeding through to pump prices. Clothing prices also increased by 2.3%, the biggest rise since 2018, as retailers significantly reduced their discounting a month after welcoming customers back into stores. The rise in inflation was, however, partly offset by a negative impact from cheaper food and drink prices. Bread, cereals and meat prices all dipped after seeing significant rises a year earlier. Karen Ward, a chief market strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management, told the BBC: ""Consumers have got all these savings they accumulated last year when they weren't allowed out. But supply is really struggling to keep pace, and so what we are seeing therefore is pops of prices in various aspects of the consumer basket."" It certainly was. Most economists were expecting inflation to hit 1.8%, and are now suggesting the rate could rise faster and higher over the next few months than previously thought. JP Morgan's Ms Ward described May's rate as a ""big upside surprise"". And HSBC economist Chris Hare said: ""Whether the upside news proves temporary or persistent, [May's rate] is clearly a hawkish surprise."" The price data was collected on or around May 11, before pubs and restaurants were allowed to serve customers indoors and cinemas and hotels reopened from 17 May. The Bank of England has said it expects inflation to hit 2.5% by the end of this year before settling back to its 2% target as the impact of post-lockdown energy price rises fades along with other cost pressures, such as bottlenecks in supply chains. As you'd expect, economists are divided. Ms Ward said that if inflation pressure was sustained into next year, ""we could see interest rate hikes"" to dampen down rising prices. UK rates, however, remain at historic lows. Also, there are some benefits to rising rates - for example, on the amount of interest people earn on savings. Nevertheless, the low-rate environment that has existed for a decade and upward changes could be a shock for many consumers and businesses. Last week, the Bank of England's chief economist, Andy Haldane, said a rise in inflation above the central bank's target must be only temporary, and that long-term levels of high inflation need to be ""avoided at all costs"". Some economists are concerned that despite rising inflation, governments continue to use stimulus to jump-start their post-Covid economies. Former treasury official Lord Nick Macpherson tweeted on Wednesday that Bank of England policies to control the amount of money in the economy are ""excessively loose"". Lord Macpherson was permanent secretary to three UK chancellors The UK is by no means an isolated case. In the US, where President Joe Biden has proposed a $6 trillion stimulus package, consumer prices hit 5% in May, the highest in almost 13 years. Jack Leslie, an economist at the Resolution Foundation think tank, said the speeding up of UK price growth from 0.3% last November to 2.1% in May represented the fastest six-month rise since sterling collapsed after the 2008-09 financial crisis. ""But UK inflationary pressures are different - and nowhere as near as large - as those causing fierce debate in the US,"" he said. In China, long a source of cheap goods for the world, inflation is also rising - effectively exporting higher prices. And Eurozone inflation rose to 2% in May, the first time the rate has surpassed the European Central Bank's target in more than two years. Nevertheless, central banks seems committed to keeping rates low. The US Fed, for example, expects rates to remain close to zero until 2023. Given the lag between changes in rate policy and the required impact on the economy, some economists worry that central banks could be leaving it too late to change direction. If you think this morning's higher-than-expected inflation number is something to be scared about, the financial markets don't share your view. Traders on foreign currency markets, for example, were unimpressed, with the pound shifting up a modest 0.3% against the euro or 0.2% against the dollar. Inflation may be slightly above the 2% target but it's no higher than it was in July 2019 and well below the 5% inflation of ten years ago, when the global economy was recovering from the 2008 financial crisis. Part of the reason the markets shrugged off the inflation figure is the widespread belief that the upward pressure on prices is temporary. Prices of raw materials such as wood and steel have shot up from a combination of two things - demand after economies re-opened and supplies still coming back up on stream. The result? Shortages and price rises. The confident expectation is that, for example, as steel manufacturers crank up production there'll be more steel to meet demand so its price will fall back, relieving the inflationary pressure. As summer turns to autumn we'll find out if that expectation is justified.

"Covid vaccinations are to become compulsory for staff at care homes in England, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said. Mr Hancock said it was a ""sensible and reasonable step"" and he would consult on extending it to the NHS. There are no plans to extend mandatory vaccinations beyond health and care workers, he said. Workers will have 16 weeks to get both jabs from the time regulations are approved by Parliament. If they do not, they face being redeployed away from front-line care or potentially losing their job. Mr Hancock told the House of Commons that the ""vast majority of staff in care homes"" were vaccinated, but not all of them. ""We know that the vaccine not only protects you but protects those around you,"" he said, adding that compulsory vaccinations in care homes and hospitals would save lives. What happened to care homes early in the pandemic? How many people have been vaccinated so far? When will I get the vaccine? Care organisations have warned that compulsory vaccinations could cause significant difficulties in a sector that already struggles to recruit enough people. The government, however, is believed to have considerable concerns about low take-up of the vaccine in some areas, including London. A Whitehall source told the BBC that guidance to doctors that they should take the Hepatitis B vaccine suggested there is a precedent for mandatory vaccination. The requirement will also apply to volunteers at care homes and those visiting for other work, such as healthcare workers, tradespeople, hairdressers and beauticians. Workers who can prove they are medically exempt from getting the vaccine will not be affected. There will be also be exemptions for visiting family and friends, under-18s, emergency services and people undertaking urgent maintenance work. Governments inScotland, Wales andNorthern Irelandhave said they have no plans to make Covid jabs mandatory for care home staff. It comes as the UK recorded a further 9,055 confirmed Covid cases and nine more deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Another 190,033 people received a first dose of the vaccine on Tuesday, bringing the total with at least one dose to more than 42 million - or 79.8% of adults. More than 30 million people - 57.8% of adults - have had both doses after a further 230,666 second jabs were given out. The move to mandatory vaccinations for care home staff in England follows a consultation by the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC), launched in April, two months after the government said it had met its target of offering all front-line care workers a first dose of a vaccine by mid-February. At the time, it said 47% of English care homes for older people had more than a fifth of staff yet to take up the vaccine, despite staff at all eligible care homes having been offered vaccines, with the vast majority of homes having had repeat visits by vaccine teams. Dr Susan Hopkins, strategic response director for Covid-19 at Public Health England, said there are ""pros and cons to any debate on mandatory vaccination"", with the ""pro"" being that those caring for the most vulnerable in care homes would be vaccinated, thus minimising the risks to residents. She said a possible downside could be that ""people may vote with their feet, and not want to have the vaccine, and therefore not work in a care home, and that could lead to staff supply issues in care homes"". Dr Hopkins said there had been ""excellent uptake"" of the vaccine, adding: ""I think where people are hesitant, we need to work harder to make them understand why the vaccines work."" This video can not be played Ros Atkins on: What are the Delta variant symptoms? The British Medical Association, which represents doctors, warned compulsion was ""a blunt instrument that carries its own risks"". It added: ""While some healthcare workers are already required to be immunised against certain conditions to work in certain areas, any specific proposal for the compulsory requirement for all staff to be vaccinated against Covid-19 would raise new ethical and legal implications."" Mike Padgham, chairman of the Independent Care Group (ICG) which represents care homes in Yorkshire, said he was disappointed by the decision and concerned it could cause legal disputes for providers. He told the Today programme: ""People should be vaccinated, every member of staff should take up the vaccine, but I just think persuasion rather than coercion or compulsion is the way to deal with it."" Susan Lord, whose mother lives in a care home in Leeds, said whilst it was ""great"" staff in the home had been vaccinated, she was ""concerned"" by the idea of mandatory jabs targeted solely at care workers. Susan Lord, whose mother is in a care home, said it seemed ""harsh"" to threaten the jobs of social care staff Ms Lord, from High Wycombe, told BBC News: ""If someone has been working in care for years and isn't able to have the vaccine or has strong objections to having it, it seems a little bit unfair that they're going to lose their job"". She said most care home staff only work in one place and are regularly tested, so it seems ""a little bit harsh"". Mr Padgham said the sector already had a ""recruitment crisis"", saying: ""We're frightened that this is going to put more people off coming into social care and that's going to be difficult."" Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK said: ""Every care home resident would want to be cared for by someone who had been vaccinated, but if a compulsory approach leads to some care workers quitting it will make existing chronic staff shortages even worse."" ""With or without mandatory vaccination,"" she said an approach of ""peer-to-peer persuasion"" should be taken in care homes, ""because this approach has been found to work well"". Low uptake among care home staff was a big concern when the vaccine programme was launched - similar issues are seen with the annual flu jab. Efforts have been made to convince staff of the need to get vaccinated - there have been advertising campaigns targeting them, webinars held by health leaders and repeat visits made to homes by vaccination teams. There are plenty of places where there has been good uptake. But there are also significant numbers of places where fewer than 80% of staff have been vaccinated - the threshold deemed essential to keep the virus out if 90% of residents are also vaccinated. Those working in the sector say there are a variety of reasons staff have cited - cultural reasons and concerns about safety. One common issue has been (unfounded) worries about its impact on fertility as the workforce is young and predominantly female. This move raises lots of concerns from individual rights to its potential to force staff out from a sector that is already short of workers. But the counter argument is that the vulnerabilities of residents and the closed environments they live in require drastic action. Kelly Andrews, national care lead of the GMB union and a former care worker told BBC News: ""We should not have forced vaccinations in social care, this is pushing the workforce away from social care in an area that we're already struggling to recruit and retain"". In a survey of about 1,000 of its carers, the GMB said, more than a third indicated they would quit their jobs if vaccines were mandated. In the care sector in Englandthere have been more than 40,000 deaths involving Covid.,external Additional reporting by Joseph Lee. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area?

"MPs will vote later on extending emergency Covid laws in England for another four weeks, amid concern over rising cases England's lockdown was due to end 21 June, but the PM wants it delayed until 19 July - a decision that is expected to be approved by MPs today People in England aged 21 and over can now book their Covid vaccine, the NHS says But vaccinations are unlikely to be offered to 12 to 17-year-olds in the UK in the near future, the BBC understands Covid vaccinations are to become compulsory for staff in care homes for older people in England Boris Johnson called Health Secretary Matt Hancock ""hopeless"" in a text message to Dominic Cummings, the PM's former chief adviser says A ban on landlords evicting firms for unpaid commercial rent is being extended for another nine months UK inflation jumped to 2.1% in the year to May, as the opening up of the economy from lockdown sparked a rise in consumer spending Researchers say they have found another life-saving therapy to treat Covid, which could help one in three of those in hospital with the virus The number of Americans who have died from Covid-19 has reached 600,012 - the most of any nation Edited by Hamish Mackay That's all from us today, thanks for joining. Our live coverage of the pandemic will be back in the morning. Before we head off, here are the main headlines this evening:  Today's coverage was brought to you by Hazel Shearing, Victoria Lindrea, Jen Meierhans, Jack Hunter and Hamish Mackay. Alison RobertsPortugal Correspondent, Lisbon Daily cases in Portugal have reached their highest level in almost two months, with 1,350 new Covid cases - and 6 deaths -  reported in the past 24 hours. It's the highest daily case number since 24 February this year. Of the cases recorded, 68% were in the capital Lisbon and the Tagus Valley region, where the Delta variant is spreading fast. Under new rules, travellers arriving in Portugal from Nepal must now quarantine, along with those from India, South Africa and Brazil. People may only travel from these countries to Portugal for essential reasons, such as work, family or health. The government has said it will review the situation at its weekly cabinet meeting on Thursday. It  follows the UK's decision to remove Portugal from its quarantine-free ""green list"" for travel. The debate about whether to delay the ending of all coronavirus restrictions in England to 19 July is ongoing in the House of Commons. Our live coverage here will be ending soon but you can continue to watch the debate onBBC iPlayerand we will report the outcome of the vote on theBBC News website. The UK has recorded another 9,055 new Covid-19 infections in the last 24 hours - above the seven-day average of 7,888. However, while cases are rising, deaths and hospitalisations remain low. Meanwhile, the number of first vaccination doses given is on the rise as the rate of second doses slows. As well as the revelations about the PM's opinion of his health secretary, former chief adviser Cummings also published messages - dated 27 April 2020 - in which the PM appears to call the situation around personal protective equipment (PPE) ""a disaster"". One message alludes to diverting some responsibilities from Mr Hancock to Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove. ""I can't think of anything except taking Hancock off and putting Gove on,"" Johnson apparently adds. At his appearance last week before the Health and Social Care and Science Committees, Hancock said he had seen no evidence to suggest any medical staff had died because of a lack of PPE. In his blog, Cummings accuses the health secretary of trying to blame NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens, Chancellor Rishi Sunak and the Cabinet Office for last April's ""PPE disaster"". ""The lack of PPE killed NHS and care home staff in March-May,"" he writes. ""The PM is trying to influence officials/advisers to support the re-writing of history and is encouraging ministers to give false accounts to Parliament."" Downing Street has yet to respond to the allegations. As we reported earlier, Dominic Cummings - the PM's former chief adviser - has published expletive-laden messages apparently from Boris Johnson, inwhich Johnson brands the health secretary ""hopeless"". Downing Street has not denied the authenticity of the messages. You can watch Matt Hancock's fleeting response to the assesment below... Allow Twitter content?

Alice EvansNewsbeat Daniela Arguello (right) hasn't seen her family since she moved to London just before the pandemic More and more of us have been getting texts from our GPs (or our mums) to tell us itâs time to book our first Covid vaccine. Appointments in England have now opened up for 21 and 22-year-olds. But some people are feeling a complicated mix of emotions â even guilt â as they book their jab. Daniela Arguello, 25, moved to the UK in January 2020, just weeks before Covid shut down global travel. In Guatemala, where Daniela is from and her family live, the daily figures for new Covid infections are currently at an all-time high. Daniela doubts any of her family will get a first dose this year. Her nan, 81, signed up back in February but has heard nothing back. ""Here we have the NHS and so much access to get care if you get Covid,"" Daniela says. ""They don't even have the capacity to deal with it, let alone have vaccines. ""It's scary and I worry about them all the time. It's sad because if they were living here they already would have been vaccinated at this point."" Read the full story here. Conservative MP Sir Desmond Swayne says he always thought it was wrong for ministers to ""take our freedoms even though they believed they were acting in our best interests in an emergency"". ""But by any measure that emergency has passed and yet freedoms are still withheld and the government will not allow us to assess for ourselves the risk we are prepared to encounter in our ordinary everyday lives. ""The government does not trust the people that it governs,"" he says. Swayne says many members of Sage have been out ""busily underminding public morale"" with one saying ""we must all remain masked and distanced"" forever. He says after the health and economic consequences of coronavirus have been dealth with the government will have set a disastrous president in terms of the future of liberty. We've got more from the debate in the Commons now. Mark Harper, chair of the Covid Recovery Group, says his worry is that there will be a continual extending of restrictions. Health Secretary Matt Hancock denies this is likely, saying eradicating the virus is not possible - and the government is aiming ""to live with Covid, like we do with flu"". The four-week delay is intended to get a second jab into ""a majority"" of over-40s by 19 July and the pause is estimated ""to save thousands of lives"", says Hancock - but he adds that a further pause would not save many more lives. ""I am confident we will not need more than four weeks to get this job done."" Away from the UK, Portugal will be the first country to benefit from the EUâs massive pandemic recovery fund, the blocâs president says. Speaking in Lisbon, Ursula von der Leyen says Portugal was the first country to present its ideas for how to spend its share of the EU's â¬750bn (Â£644bn) fund earmarked to help member states out of the sharp economic downturn caused by Covid-19. Itâs getting â¬16bn (Â£13.7bn) in grants and loans, after a 7% economic slump last year. Ms von der Leyenâs next stop is Madrid, with Spain set to get the second-largest financial handout after Italy. Jonathan Ashworth says lifting restrictions now would be ""akin to throwing petrol on a fire"", confirming that as the shadow health secretary, he will be backing the delay to restrictions for a further four weeks. But he adds ""we shouldn't be here"" - adding that the UK has failed to contain the Delta variant because of slack quarantine measures. He says the health secretary will be forever branded ""Hopeless Hancock"" - following Dominic Cummings' revelations of text messages from the PM earlier - a view which, Mr Ashworth adds, might now be shared by members of the public. Ashworth says the government ""failed to protect our borders"" and he accuses them of giving the Delta variant ""the red carpet"" - reiterating Labour leader's Sir Keir Starmer's attack at PMQs earlier today. A total of72,461,462vaccination doses have now been given in the UK, according to thegovernment's daily figures.,external That's42,021,089first doses and30,440,373second doses. Find out where how the vaccine rollout is progressing across the UKhere. A further nine people have died with coronavirus in the UK, according togovernment's daily figures.,external This takes the total number of people to die in the 28 days following a positive Covid-19 test to 127,926. There were also 9,055 new infections recorded in the last 24 hours. Matt Hancock confirms - as reported earlier by the BBC - that vaccinations will be mandatory for older people's care home workers in England and there will be consultation over whether to do the same for NHS workers and domiciliary carers. He says: ""The vast majority of staff in care homes are already vaccinated but not all and we know that the vaccine not only protects you but it protects those around you. ""And therefore we will be taking forward the measures to ensure the mandation for as a condition of deployment for staff in care homes and we will consult on the same approach in the NHS in order to save lives and protect patients from the disease,"" he says. Hancock says he does not agree with making vaccines compulsory for the whole population but says it is a ""sensible and reasonable step"" for those caring for the most vulnerable. He says there were ""no proposals to go any wider"" than those in domicillary care and the NHS. By 18 June, the NHS says all adults in England will be eligible for their first dose. And by 19 July, all those aged over 50 and the clinically extremely vulnerable will have been offered second doses. Across the rest of the UK:  Our health reporter Philippa Roxby has everything you need to know about vaccineshere. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has opened the debate on whether to delay the easing of coronavirus restrictions He tells MPs the Delta variant has given the virus ""extra legs"" because it spreads more easily. ""And because there's some evidence that the risk of hospitalisation is higher than for the Alpha variant, which was of course previously dominant in this country,"" he says. ""The Delta variant now accounts for 96% of new cases. The number of cases is rising and hospitalisations are starting to rise too - they are up 48% over the past week,"" he says. ""The number of deaths in England is thankfully not rising and remains very low."" He adds: ""We don't yet know the extent to which the link between hospitalisation and deaths has been broken, so we propose to give the NHS a few more crucial weeks to get those remaining jabs into the arms of those who need them."" MPs are now debating whether to extend emergency Covid laws in England for another four weeks, amid concern over rising cases. Boris Johnson says delaying the planned lifting of restrictions until 19 July will give the NHS ""a few more crucial weeks"" to get people vaccinated. Labour accuses ministers of letting the Delta variant in by not toughening rules on travel from India sooner. But it is likely to support delaying an end to lockdown, meaning the government is expected to win the vote. We will let you know when it goes to a vote.Here's all the background. Young people in Wales should be given free access to gyms and leisure centres, according to proposals being put forward by the Welsh Conservatives. They have called for measures to boost participation in sport with Covid having a detrimental impact ""at all levels"". Gyms, leisure centres and fitness facilities in Wales were forced to close for much of the pandemic, but have been allowed to reopen since 3 May. The Welsh Conservatives spokesperson for sport, Tom Giffard, says many now needed help to recover. He said it was ""vital"" to get ""young and old back on the sporting fields and facilities of Wales"". Tory Senedd members have triggered a vote on the subject later this afternoon, although it is not binding on Wales' ministers. You can read more about the planhere. A ban on landlords evicting firms for unpaid commercial rent is being extended for another nine months. The ban, which stops landlords taking tenants to court for non-payment, was due to end on 30 June. Treasury Secretary Stephen Barclay says the delay in easing lockdown restrictions, announced on Monday, ""presents additional challenges"" to business. It is estimated that firms in retail and hospitality are Â£5bn in rent debt. ""Existing measures will remain in place, including extending the current moratorium to protect commercial tenants from eviction to March 25, 2022,"" Mr Barclay tells the Commons. Thousands of companies, especially in the hospitality sector, are still unable to trade normally, among them nightclubs and leisure firms. BBC Radio 5 Live BBC Radio 5 Live is hearing what listeners think about plans to make all care home staff have a Covid vaccine. Tina Bentley, who runs a care home in Essex, says she is absolutely behind vaccinating all care home staff. She explains how all of her 36 members of staff are vaccinated: âFrom admin staff, to maintenance, everyone that entered my home on a staff level got vaccinated, and we had less heartache with that.â Tina says she sees the Covid vaccine as a fundamental safety measure, like PPE. âItâs not different to me putting a face mask on to protect someone. Youâre trying to make them safe, that is what we are trained to do. âSo for me, a vaccine keeps everybody safe,â she adds. But another caller, Molly, says she thinks introducing compulsory vaccines in the care sector is a âslippery slopeâ. Molly, who lives in Wiltshire, used to run a recruitment agency for the care sector. She adds: âIâm sure there will be legal challenges against this. No one should be forced to have a vaccine.â You can listen live to 5 Live on theBBC Sounds app. Â© 2025 BBC.

"New hits and classic tracks have helped the UK become the second-biggest exporter of music in the world Dua Lipa, Coldplay and The Beatles helped the British record industry earn Â£519.7m overseas last year, the highest figure on record. Export revenues for music grew by 6% compared to 2019, aided by the ""explosive growth of music streaming"", said record label association the BPI. One in 10 tracks streamed globally hail from the UK, with 300 British artists receiving 100 million streams or more. Dua Lipa's Don't Start Now was the biggest British hit of 2020. The club anthem was streamed 1.62 billion times in total, while her Brit Award-winning album Future Nostalgia was the 10th best-seller of the year. Harry Styles' second record Fine Line did even better - emerging as the world's fifth best-selling album of 2020. Despite these achievements, there were no British artists listed among the year's top 10 biggest-sellers across all formats - raising questions about the UK's ability to create global superstars in an increasingly competitive marketplace. Instead, the list was topped by Korean pop band BTS, with the rest of the acts coming from North America - including The Weeknd, Billie Eilish and Taylor Swift. BTS named world's best-selling artists of 2020 Music listening soared during lockdown Fifth of all songs streamed in UK in 2020 were rap According to the BPI, the UK is still the largest exporter of music in the world, after the USA - but its share of the global market has dropped from 17% in 2015 to 10% last year. However, with the exception of Dua Lipa's album, 2020 was relatively quiet for major new releases from British artists. This year could play out very differently -  with Adele, Ed Sheeran and Coldplay all working on new albums. The global popularity of classic acts like The Beatles, Queen, Pink Floyd and The Rolling Stones has also helped sustain the British music industry on streaming services. Earlier this year, the BPI announced that total UK recorded music revenue had risen by 3.8% in 2020 to reach Â£1.118 billion, driven largely by the growth of streaming. This is the highest total since 2006 (Â£1.17bn) and the fifth consecutive year of growth. The figures come as musicians and songwriters stage an increasingly vocal protest about the way streaming revenue is handled. The Musicians' Union and the Ivors Academy for songwriters and composers told a parliamentary inquiry into the issue that music creators were being ""cheated"" out of royalties, while record labels reap the rewards. According to the Broken Record campaign, artists receive around 16% of the total income from streams, while record companies receive around 41% and streaming services around 29%. However, the BPI has argued that streaming works in artists' favour. It said that 1,800 artists had achieved more than 10 million streams in the UK during 2020,  earned them around Â£29,400 each. It also suggested that streaming has made the market more ""democratic"" - with the top 10 artists accounting for just 5% of all music streamed last year. When CDs were the dominant form of music consumption in 2005, the top 10 artists were responsible 13% of all sales. Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

"The UK inflation rate jumped to 2.1% in the year to May, the highest for almost two years, as the easing of lockdown sparked a rise in consumer spending. The Consumer Prices Index measure of inflation rose from 1.5% in April,according to the Office for National Statistics,external, driven by the rising cost of fuel and clothing. The rate is now above the Bank of England's 2% target for inflation. That will fuel the debate about whether it's time to raise interest rates. May's reading was above most economists' forecasts of an increase of about 1.8%. Simply put, inflation is the rate at which prices are rising - if the cost of a Â£1 jar of jam rises by 5p, then jam inflation is 5%. It applies to services too, like having your nails done or getting your car valeted. You may not notice low levels of inflation from month to month, but in the long term, these price rises can have a big impact on how much you can buy with your money. Read more about inflation here. ONS chief economist Grant Fitzner said the biggest single rise was coming from fuel prices, which were falling this time last year as the lockdown started to bite. Petrol and diesel saw a 17.9% price surge over the past year, representing the highest increase for more than four years. Crude oil prices have been increasing over the past few months, which is expected to continue feeding through to pump prices. Clothing prices also increased by 2.3%, the biggest rise since 2018, as retailers significantly reduced their discounting a month after welcoming customers back into stores. The rise in inflation was, however, partly offset by a negative impact from cheaper food and drink prices. Bread, cereals and meat prices all dipped after seeing significant rises a year earlier. Karen Ward, a chief market strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management, told the BBC: ""Consumers have got all these savings they accumulated last year when they weren't allowed out. But supply is really struggling to keep pace, and so what we are seeing therefore is pops of prices in various aspects of the consumer basket."" It certainly was. Most economists were expecting inflation to hit 1.8%, and are now suggesting the rate could rise faster and higher over the next few months than previously thought. JP Morgan's Ms Ward described May's rate as a ""big upside surprise"". And HSBC economist Chris Hare said: ""Whether the upside news proves temporary or persistent, [May's rate] is clearly a hawkish surprise."" The price data was collected on or around May 11, before pubs and restaurants were allowed to serve customers indoors and cinemas and hotels reopened from 17 May. The Bank of England has said it expects inflation to hit 2.5% by the end of this year before settling back to its 2% target as the impact of post-lockdown energy price rises fades along with other cost pressures, such as bottlenecks in supply chains. As you'd expect, economists are divided. Ms Ward said that if inflation pressure was sustained into next year, ""we could see interest rate hikes"" to dampen down rising prices. UK rates, however, remain at historic lows. Also, there are some benefits to rising rates - for example, on the amount of interest people earn on savings. Nevertheless, the low-rate environment that has existed for a decade and upward changes could be a shock for many consumers and businesses. Last week, the Bank of England's chief economist, Andy Haldane, said a rise in inflation above the central bank's target must be only temporary, and that long-term levels of high inflation need to be ""avoided at all costs"". Some economists are concerned that despite rising inflation, governments continue to use stimulus to jump-start their post-Covid economies. Former treasury official Lord Nick Macpherson tweeted on Wednesday that Bank of England policies to control the amount of money in the economy are ""excessively loose"". Lord Macpherson was permanent secretary to three UK chancellors The UK is by no means an isolated case. In the US, where President Joe Biden has proposed a $6 trillion stimulus package, consumer prices hit 5% in May, the highest in almost 13 years. Jack Leslie, an economist at the Resolution Foundation think tank, said the speeding up of UK price growth from 0.3% last November to 2.1% in May represented the fastest six-month rise since sterling collapsed after the 2008-09 financial crisis. ""But UK inflationary pressures are different - and nowhere as near as large - as those causing fierce debate in the US,"" he said. In China, long a source of cheap goods for the world, inflation is also rising - effectively exporting higher prices. And Eurozone inflation rose to 2% in May, the first time the rate has surpassed the European Central Bank's target in more than two years. Nevertheless, central banks seems committed to keeping rates low. The US Fed, for example, expects rates to remain close to zero until 2023. Given the lag between changes in rate policy and the required impact on the economy, some economists worry that central banks could be leaving it too late to change direction. If you think this morning's higher-than-expected inflation number is something to be scared about, the financial markets don't share your view. Traders on foreign currency markets, for example, were unimpressed, with the pound shifting up a modest 0.3% against the euro or 0.2% against the dollar. Inflation may be slightly above the 2% target but it's no higher than it was in July 2019 and well below the 5% inflation of ten years ago, when the global economy was recovering from the 2008 financial crisis. Part of the reason the markets shrugged off the inflation figure is the widespread belief that the upward pressure on prices is temporary. Prices of raw materials such as wood and steel have shot up from a combination of two things - demand after economies re-opened and supplies still coming back up on stream. The result? Shortages and price rises. The confident expectation is that, for example, as steel manufacturers crank up production there'll be more steel to meet demand so its price will fall back, relieving the inflationary pressure. As summer turns to autumn we'll find out if that expectation is justified.

"Barbara Windsor began appearing in the Carry On films in the 1960s The bikini worn by Dame Barbara Windsor in the 1969 film Carry On Camping has sold at auction for Â£9,500. The late actress wore the swimwear in a famous scene where her bikini top flew off in the middle of an exercise class. The proceeds from sale of the item, which had been rescued from a bin decades ago, will be donated by the vendor to the Alzheimer's Society. The actress, who also starred in EastEnders, died in December from Alzheimer's at the age of 83. An image from the scene in Carry On Camping was included in the order of service for her funeral, accompanied by her quote: ""That picture will follow me to the end."" The scene had to be shot three times, with the garment being removed by the deft use of a fishing rod in the hands of an off-screen assistant. Remnants of the fishing line could still be seen stitched to the front of the top, the auction house said. The chartreuse cotton towelling bikini was expected to fetch between Â£800 and Â£1,200 The item was sold to an American buyer after a bidding war between telephone and online buyers. Dame Barbara's husband Scott Mitchell said: ""It's a touching tribute to Barbara to think any item associated with that famous scene will raise money to help people living with Alzheimer's. ""I'd say it was fitting - but it flew off.... so it wasn't!"" Although she became synonymous with the saucy film series, Dame Barbara only appeared in nine Carry On films Auctioneer Kerry Taylor said: ""We have had so much interest in this bikini, from devoted fans of the Carry On films to people who simply love Barbara Windsor. During her long career, she was renowned for her down-to-earth nature, great sense of humour and superb acting ability. ""She was a true professional. It seems very apt that a bikini that caused her so much embarrassment during the filming will now go to such a good cause."" According to the auction house, the Carry On Camping wardrobe department would have commissioned duplicate bikinis for the film, but this was the only example known to have survived after it was rescued from a bin during a costumier's stock clearance. Kate Lee, chief executive of Alzheimer's Society, said: ""Dame Barbara Windsor inspired so many when she spoke out about her dementia diagnosis and we are so incredibly grateful to have had her and her husband Scott's unwavering support - what they achieved for people with dementia has been truly awe-inspiring. ""It is fantastic that such an iconic item will continue Dame Barbara's legacy to support people affected by dementia, and we are touched by the generosity of the vendor.""

"This video can not be played Fairbourne residents say they could become ""climate change refugees"" People living in a sea-threatened village on the west coast of Wales are calling for answers over their future. Sea defences at Fairbourne will stop being maintained in the 2050s, but Gwynedd Council said it may begin ""decommissioning"" the village before then and start moving residents out. Villagers want more detail on when and how, saying uncertainty is devaluing homes and harming community life. The council said it had met with residents more than 300 times. Natural Resources Wales maintains the sea defences and a council consultation is taking place on Thursday and Friday to hear residents' views on options for the next few years. But some say there also needs to be more discussion about what happens to them and their homes if the village is to be abandoned to the sea. The council is leading a partnership to co-ordinate what happens in Fairbourne, and says some of the decisions about what happens in the long term are out of its hands. It said it was forecast ""that the engineering and financial challenges of protecting the village are likely to become insurmountable earlier than other areas"". There are ""five specific plans which can be taken forward and developed by partner organisations over the coming years"" to be considered by locals during the consultation, it added. The plans focus on flood risk management, people and the built environment, infrastructure management, economy and business management, and natural environment management. Fairbourne will be ""abandoned to the sea"" when defences are no longer maintained from the 2050s Sylvia Stephenson, who lives in the village, said: ""I don't really think that we'll get the answers to the questions that we want. ""The answers we want are: what are you going to do with us if we have a major event or you want to decommission the village? To decommission the village, you're going to have to take my house and my land. ""We own this house and we own the land, and the only way you can do that is with legislation. And that in turn has to mean compulsory purchase. I don't know if we're going to get any answers about that. ""I don't know if we'll get any answers at all about where they could put us all."" Rising sea levels threatening the Welsh coast What is climate change doing to Wales? Climate change 'will alter' beach Another resident, Malcolm Flynn, said there was still scope for the authorities to look again at the long-term future of the village. He said: ""The council gave an undertaking that they would do their best to protect the village for 40 years. After that, anything could happen. ""It's like the guillotine hanging over you, waiting to drop. The council has relied on one consultant to give a view where I suspect there are many differing views and different things to check. ""Young people living here can't get a mortgage. Houses are cheap, but they can't get a mortgage because no-one will lend them money. Likewise older people who need equity release can't get it.""
