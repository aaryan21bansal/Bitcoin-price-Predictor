"Shares in GameStop surged on Wednesday in what could mark a return to frenzied trading that rocked markets last month. Trading in the US games firm was halted twice after shares more than doubled suddenly on Wednesday afternoon. GameStop stock climbed by 104% until trading was halted for a second time - moments before markets closed. The rapid rise came as Reddit, the online home of activist investors that led the GameStop movement in January, went down temporarily. The stock gained nearly 90% in after-hours trading. It came one day after the firm announced its chief financial officer Jim Bell would resign next month to help ""accelerate GameStop's transformation"". Some investors have talked publicly and posted on social media site Reddit about not selling their shares in GameStop during last month's volatile trading because of what they see as its long-term potential. On Wednesday, Reddit was down for many users. The company did not say what caused the outage but said it had identified the issue, fixed it and that ""systems are beginning to recover.""

It is the latest twist in a battle that has pitted amateur investors against Wall Street giants. Major hedge funds had bet billions of dollars that GameStop's shares would fall. But they have faced major losses after amateurs, swapping tips on social media sites like Reddit, drove up the share price by more than 700% in one week. The retail trading frenzy drew concern from regulators and has even led to a Congressional hearing in the US. This video can not be played WATCH: What's been going on at GameStop? Keith Gill, who became a key player in the trading and is known as 'Roaring Kitty' on YouTube, has also been hit with a class action lawsuit. He allegedly duped retail investors into buying inflated stocks while hiding his sophisticated financial background. Mr Gill has downplayed his impact and rebutted claims he violated any laws. 'Roaring Kitty' GameStop investor hit with lawsuit GameStop - David and Goliath or a political fable? ""The idea that I used social media to promote GameStop stock to unwitting investors is preposterous,"" Mr Gill said in the prepared testimony. ""I was abundantly clear that my channel was for educational purposes only, and that my aggressive style of investing was unlikely to be suitable for most folks checking out the channel."" The GameStop saga was hailed as a victory of the little guys against big Wall Street hedge funds that were betting against video games retailer GameStop and other struggling businesses. But it is unclear what role hedge funds had in the rally, as some are reported to have made millions from the GameStop share rally that was inspired by Reddit users. The key part of the theory of why GameStop shares went up so high in January was a 'short squeeze'. This is when hedge funds, who'd bet GameStop shares would fall, tried to buy them back when the share price began to rise. That in turn pushed the price even higher. Some hedge funds lost hundreds of millions of pounds. The prevailing view was that hedge funds wouldn't put themselves into that position again. That they would be all over Reddit and more careful about 'shorting'.  Therefore, you wouldn't see a giant spike in the share price again. But evidently, that view was wrong. That the share price, in just a few hours, could explode again tests some of the assumptions about what happened last month. It's often very difficult to understand exactly what drives a share price, and who is driving it. But it does once again appear that the hype on WallStreetBets, the influential subreddit, was part of the rise. Reddit even went down at one point, though it's not clear yet whether that was because of an increase in activity on the site. Policy makers will be looking on closely. At a hearing last week in Washington, many politicians were concerned that 'meme stocks' could spike again. That can be beneficial to some investors when the stock is rising. But on the way down amateur investors can get burnt too. If these kinds of spikes become more common, expect more pressure on legislators to step in.

"The Ellesmere Port plant currently builds an old model of the Vauxhall Astra. Talks to secure the future of Vauxhall's Ellesmere Port plant will continue after no firm decision was taken on Wednesday. A board meeting of Vauxhall's parent company ended without agreement on its fate, although an announcement is expected within 48 hours. More than 1,000 people work at the site - with many more in the supply chain. The business secretary has met the management of parent company Stellantis three times in the last six weeks. The most recent meeting took place on Monday night, with talks involving government officials along with company management and representatives of the local authority. ""We are committed to ensuring the UK continues to be one of the best locations in the world for automotive manufacturing, and we're doing all we can to protect and create jobs, while securing a competitive future for theâ¯sector,"" a government spokesperson said. The BBC understands that there are three main options on the table for the Cheshire plant: Continue production of internal combustion engine-powered cars - with the possible addition of a new hatchback model - for the short-term until the prospect of the ban on sales of new petrol and diesel vehicles in 2030 makes the plant obsolete within a few years. Make plans to wind down production at Ellesmere Port completely. Secure the plant's long-term future by committing to making a new generation of electric cars in the North West. While number three is obviously the outcome the government and unions would prefer, it requires confidence that the UK will be able to build the necessary battery production facilities to service this and other UK car plants. Currently, the only viable battery plant is in the North East, which works exclusively with its former owner Nissan. Future of Ellesmere Port hangs in the balance UK new car registrations in 2020 sink to 30-year low Under the terms of the Brexit trade deal, it is possible for batteries made in the European Union (EU) to be installed in UK-assembled vehicles for export back to the EU (where most are sold). But industry experts say the economics don't make sense as the batteries are heavy and hard to transport as they are not currently permitted through the Channel Tunnel for safety reasons. Doubts about the long-term future of the factory intensified after recent comments from the chief executive of the parent company Stellantis - the new name for the merged PSA and Fiat Chrysler. Carlos Tavares referred to the ""brutal"" decisionfor the UK government to bring forward the ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars to 2030 and said it might make more sense to move future electric production closer to its biggest market in the EU. Government officials are aware that the future of car production in the UK depends on a rapid scaling up of battery production and it is widely hoped Chancellor Rishi Sunak will address the issue in his Budget speech next Wednesday, which is coincidentally the same day that Stellantis announce their annual results and operating review.

"Montmartre was still semi-rural when Van Gogh painted it A Vincent Van Gogh painting of a Paris street has gone on display for the first time after spending more than 100 years behind closed doors. A Street Scene In Montmartre has been owned by a French family for most of the time since it was painted in 1887. Sotheby's estimates it could fetch up to eight million euros (Â£6.9m) when it is sold at auction next month. Van Gogh expert Martin Bailey told BBC News that this is ""the first time we are able to see it properly"". Small reproductions have been made in the past, often in black-and-white. ""What is exciting is that it is a Van Gogh painting which has been hidden away ever since it came off the artist's easel,"" Mr Bailey said. ""It has always been in private collections, so only the owners and their friends knew it. ""It is an interesting picture because it is a transitional work between Van Gogh's Dutch years, when he painted in dark, earthy colours, and the exuberant works that he did in Provence. It was in Paris that he discovered the Impressionists, and this led him to explore colour."" The 1887 painting will be sold on 25 March It is one of a series of works Van Gogh created while lodging with his brother Theo in 1886 and 1887 a short distance from the street depicted in the painting. The estimated price tag of five to eight million euros reflects the fact that the artist's Paris paintings do not fetch the ""mega sums"" of his Provence paintings, added Mr Bailey, who writesa blog on Van Gogh for The Art Newspaper,external. ""But until the hammer goes down, one obviously never knows what will happen at an auction. There is now a great deal of interest in Van Gogh in the Far East, so the Van Gogh market is truly global."" The painting will be displayed at Sotheby's auction houses in Paris, Amsterdam and Hong Kong ahead of its sale on 25 March. Sotheby's said: ""The appearance on the market of a work of this calibre, and from such an iconic series, is undoubtedly a major event."" Montmartre was still semi-rural when the scene was painted. A windmill features prominently behind some perambulating locals. The famous SacrÃ©-CÅur church that now dominates the area was under construction at the time. Van Gogh left Paris for the south of France in 1888. He died near Paris in July 1890. Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

"The WHO and Unicef said the delivery was a momentous occasion Ghana has become the first country to receive coronavirus vaccines through the Covax vaccine-sharing initiative. A delivery of 600,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine arrived in Accra on Wednesday. The first recipients are due to be healthcare workers. The Covax scheme aims to reduce the divide between rich countries and poorer nations unable to buy doses. The programme is planning to deliver about two billion vaccine doses globally by the end of the year. Ghana, which has a population of over 30m, was chosen as the first recipient of the free vaccines after promising quick distribution and meeting the criteria set by Covax. Further deliveries are expected to neighbouring Ivory Coast later this week, the Covax alliance says. Vaccinations are expected to start in Ghana next week, and, as well as health workers, those over 60, people with underlying health conditions, and senior officials are due to be prioritised. The vaccines delivered to Accra were produced by the Serum Institute of India and developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University. The vaccine has been approved by the World Health Organization (WHO) and its roll-out in Ghana is not part of a trial. The doses being sent to lower-income countries such as Ghana are funded by donations. As well as procuring and delivering the vaccines, Covax partners are supporting local authorities in areas such as training people to administer the jabs and helping provide an adequate cold-chain storage and delivery system.       Source: Our World in Data  Many nations in the developed world, which began their own vaccinations months ago, have faced criticism for buying or ordering more vaccines than they need. But many of those countries placed orders for doses with pharmaceutical companies before knowing whether the vaccine in development would be effective. They were hedging their bets - placing multiple orders in the hope that at least some of them would work out. The UK, which has ordered 400 million vaccine doses and will have many left over, has said itwill donate most of its surplus vaccine supply to poorer countries. This video can not be played Covax vaccine plan: What is it and how will it work? The Covax scheme is led by the WHO and also involves the Global Vaccine Alliance (Gavi) and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (Cepi). In a joint statement, the WHO and the United Nations children's fund (Unicef) saidit was a momentous occasion,externaland ""critical in bringing the pandemic to an end"". Find out how the roll-out is going near you The scheme to share unused vaccines with other countries The slow rollout of Covid vaccinations in Africa The cost of not counting the dead Ghana has recorded more than 80,700 cases of coronavirus and 580 deaths since the pandemic began. These numbers are believed to fall short of the actual toll because of low levels of testing. Though the vaccines are not generally intended for children, Unicef is involved in the scheme because of its expertise in procurement and the logistics of vaccine delivery. The Covax scheme was set up by the WHO, the Gavi vaccines alliance and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) to try to prevent poorer countries from being pushed to the back of the queue. The programme is designed so that richer countries buying vaccines agree to help finance access for poorer nations, too. It hopes to deliver more than two billion doses to people in 190 countries in less than a year. In particular, it wants to ensure 92 poorer countries will receive access to vaccines at the same time as 98 wealthier countries. The AstraZeneca vaccine is known as Covishield in India, where the doses delivered to Ghana were made It aims to reach up to 20% of the populations of poorer countries, at no cost to their governments. Most African countries are intended recipients of Covax, buta number of them such as Senegal have been making provisions for vaccines outside the initiative. Commenting on Wednesday's first shipment, the Director-General of the WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said it was a major first step but just the beginning. ""We will not end the pandemic anywhere unless we end it everywhere"", he added. Coronavirus cases, deaths, vaccinations by country Analysis by BBC Africa health editor Anne Mawathe The arrival of the first Covax vaccines in Ghana follows sharp criticism that African countries could be left behind in the fight against Covid-19. Western countries have been condemned for their rush to purchase more vaccines than they needed, leaving little left over for the rest of the world. But this is just a start. Ghana, a country with a population of about 31 million people, has now got a total of 600,000 doses of the vaccine. Africa, a continent with about 1.4 billion people, is largely still waiting on Covax to deliver. It is unlikely that many governments on the continent will go to the market and fight it out with countries with more financial muscle. In fact, most African countries will be buying the vaccines at a higher price than their Western counterparts, partly because they didn't pre-order. Some have called for the big pharmaceutical companies to stop blocking a patent waiver, which would lead to lower prices and mean more vaccine would be produced. But the companies have not agreed to this, knowing it could dent any profit margin. Covax has so far raised $6bn (Â£4.3bn), but says it needs at least another $2bn to meet its target for 2021. The scheme has faced some criticism for not moving quickly enough. One WHO board member, Austria's Dr Clemens Martin Auer, said it had been slow to secure vaccine deals and deliver doses. The joint statement on Wednesday said the shipment to Ghana represented ""the beginning of what should be the largest vaccine procurement and supply operation in history"". Nana Kofi Quakyi, who is a health policy research fellow at New York University's School of Global Public Health, told the BBC that Ghana would still struggle to compete with wealthier nations to make up the shortfall in doses it needed to find, even with the Covax initiative. ""The challenge that countries like Ghana are having is that in an open market, our bargaining power for bilateral deals is just not competitive against other wealthier countries that... in some cases, are buying more than they even need.""

"Residents of some blocks deemed to be unsafe have been forced to leave A group of Tory MPs has lost a House of Commons bid to protect leaseholders living in flats from ""financial ruin"" due to the cost of safety improvements. The Fire Safety Bill - to strengthen regulations following the Grenfell Tower fire - comes after financial help was granted to install better cladding. But flat owners say they still face costs of up to Â£50,000 for other works and insurance premiums. More than 30 Conservative MPs support an amendment to the England-only bill. But there was not time in the Commons on Wednesday for the move - opposed by the government, which said it was preparing fuller plans to help those with large costs - to go to a vote. Labour accused ministers of insulting ""people across the country"". Grenfell cladding use 'accident waiting to happen' Flat owners face uncertainty over cladding fund What makes cladding unsafe and what are your rights? But another amendment - calling for a ban on freeholders passing fire safety improvement costs on to leaseholders - did go to a vote, and was beaten by 340 to 225. The bill now goes to the House of Lords, which has previously disagreed with the Commons on several changes to it. Messages of condolence were written on a wall outside a community church in the days following the Grenfell Tower fire The Grenfell Tower fire of 2017 killed 72 people, with the west London building later revealed to have been covered in combustible cladding. Inspectors subsequently found many other blocks were unsafe and thousands of flat owners have since faced large bills for safety improvements, such as changes to emergency exits. In the Commons, Conservative MP Royston Smith said the housing market was at risk of partial ""collapse"", with many leaseholders unable to sell. He urged MPs to ""think very carefully before they abandon thousands of constituents"", warning: ""They will not forget and they will not forgive."" But Home Office minister Kit Malthouse said the Fire Safety Bill was ""not the correct place for remediation costs to be addressed"", as the legislation's only job was to ""clarify"" that fire safety orders apply to cladding and flat entrances. He added that the Building Safety Bill, set to be introduced in the spring, would contain ""detailed and complex"" measures on payments. Earlier this month, the government announced it was putting Â£3.5bn towards removing unsafe cladding from buildings more than 18m high - on top of Â£1.6bn for cladding removal announced last year. The government also said flat owners in lower-rise blocks would be able to access loans to cover repair work, and they would not have to pay back more than Â£50 a month. Labour called on the government to ""do the right thing"". Shadow fire minister Sarah Jones said: ""It is shameful that they have voted against implementing vital fire safety measures called for by the Grenfell Inquiry, and it is an insult to people across the country that this government voted down protections for leaseholders from fire safety costs that they did not cause.""

"Rina Sawayama will now be eligible for this year's Rising Star award A pop star who was told she was ""not British enough"" to enter The Brits and the Mercury Prize has won a reversal in the awards' eligibility rules. Rina Sawayama was told she could not compete for the prizes last year, because she was not a British citizen. The singer, who has lived in the UK for 26 years, has now won the right to compete, after meeting award bosses. Under new rules, artists who have been resident in the UK for more than five years qualify for the main prizes. Sawayama holds indefinite leave to remain in the UK, but retains a Japanese passport to maintain ties with her family, including her father, who live in her country of birth. As Japan does not allow dual citizenship, she cannot have a British passport. That led to her critically-acclaimed debut album, also called Sawayama, being ruled ineligible for last year's Mercury Prize. ""It was just heartbreaking,"" she told BBC News. ""I think a lot of immigrants feel this way -  where they assimilate and they become part of the British culture... and to be told that we're not even eligible to be nominated is very othering."" Rina Sawayama: Turning familial pain into pop gold Pop star 'not British enough' for Mercury prize Sawayama first raised concerns about the situation in aninterview with Vice last year,external. ""All I remember is living here,"" she said. ""I've just lived here all my life. I went to summer school in Japan, and that's literally it. But I feel like I've contributed to the UK in a way that I think is worthy of being celebrated, or at least being eligible to be celebrated."" The hashtag #SawayamaIsBritish trended in the UK shortly after her interview was published. ""Part of me that worried that I was... going to get blacklisted from the music industry for bringing this up,"" she told the BBC. ""But I'm glad I did."" Allow YouTube content?

The singer subsequently met with the BPI, which organises both the Brits and the Mercury Prize, and convinced them to review their criteria. ""I'm over the moon to share the news that, following a number of conversations, the BPI has decided to change the rules,"" Sawayama posted on Instagram on Wednesday. ""Starting this year, artists (like me) will be eligible for nomination even without British citizenship."" The Brit Awards confirmed the change to the BBC, saying it would apply to all its award categories, as well as the Mercury Prize. Artists will now have to meet one of three criteria to be eligible: They were born in the UK. They are a UK passport holder (this includes those that hold more than one passport). They have been permanently resident in the UK for more than five years. The change means Sawayama will be eligible for this year's Rising Star award, which recognises up-and-coming talent. However, she will not be able to compete in the main categories - including best British female and best album - as her record did not chart in the Top 40. Allow Instagram content?

Sawayama has previously benefitted from funding from the BPI Music Export Growth Scheme, a grant that supports and celebrates British musicians, and her album is littered with references about growing up in London. The record, which skilfully blends millennial pop and R&B with elements of nu-metal, was one of the best-reviewed new releases of 2020, with anaverage score of 89%,externalon the review aggregation site Metacritic. Many publications, including the Guardian and the NME, named it among their best albums of the year; and it took11th place in the BBC's ""poll of polls"", which combined the year-end lists from 35 influential newspapers, magazines and blogs.

"Stormzy is one of the headliners at this year's Reading and Leeds festival Reading and Leeds Festival organisers say they are ""very confident"" the events will go ahead this summer, after plans to ease lockdown were announced. Under the government's plan, limits on social contact in England could be gone by 21 June, if Covid is under control. The twin-site festival is due to take place from 27 to 29 August. ""The good news is that we can be very confident that Reading and Leeds is going to take place,"" festival boss Melvin Benn told BBC Radio 1. Asked how the event could go ahead when others like Glastonbury had been forced to cancel, he told Radio 1's Newsbeat: ""In fairness, we haven't done it, the government have done it.

Live music 'at the back of queue to reopen' Festivals could be 'as safe as Sainsbury's' Festival season is 'still possible' in 2021 Suffolk's Latitude festival, which is also run by Benn's company Festival Republic, is expected to make an announcement about its plans for 2021 in the near future,  he added. Last year, he told MPs his events could not go ahead while social distancing was in place. However, he said live music could resume with mass testing of fans. It is unclear what measures will be in place this summer. Reading and Leeds is regarded by many fans as second only to Glastonbury in the annual UK music calendar. Originally a rock festival, it has seen legendary performances by Nirvana, Oasis, Guns N' Roses and Paramore. More recently, it has embraced dance and hip-hop, with high-profile slots for The Prodigy, Kendrick Lamar and Post Malone. This year, the festival is due to host about 200,000 fans at Richfield Avenue in Reading and Bramham Park in Leeds, with two main stages at each site. Scenes like this may still not be possible in August The festival's bullish announcement comes less than 48 hours after Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced his four-step plan for easing restrictions. Under the proposals, outdoor hospitality, including drive-in cinemas, could re-open as part of step two in April. Pilots of indoor live events, with social distancing, could also commence at the same time. Step three, which would start no earlier that 17 May, could allow limited indoor mixing. Indoor concerts would have a limit of 1,000 people or 50% of a venue's maximum capacity. Outdoor concerts and sporting events would have an upper limit of 4,000 people - or 10,000 for seated events. The roadmap gives no guarantee for those dates, with every step dependent on slowing the spread of Covid-19. Benn said he thought it was unlikely the timetable would change. ""Why would it?"" he asked, adding that ""we have to, at some point, start planning for life to go back"" to normal. Dr Google, manager of rap act Bad Boy Chiller Crew, who are due to play Reading and Leeds, added: ""Obviously anything can get cancelled but... I don't think the music industry could last another 12 months without any live events"". The industry has largely welcomed the timeline for the lifting of lockdown restrictions in England. However, it warned that live music was ""at the back of the queue to re-open"" and may still need financial assistance. Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

"This video can not be played Vaughan Gething said the vaccination target would be reached as ""long as supply matches our ability to deliver"" All adults in Wales will have been offered a first Covid vaccine by 31 July, the health minister has promised. Vaughan Gething said matchingPrime Minister Boris Johnson'sjab pledge for the whole UK would depend on supplies. The new date is a few months ahead of the original autumn plan laid out by the Welsh Government in January. Over-50s and over-16s with an underlying health condition will be offered vaccines by the middle of April, Mr Gething added. Wales is currently ahead of the other UK nations in the proportion of the population that has been vaccinated. Can firms refuse to hire people without Covid jab? Does Wales have a roadmap out of lockdown? How many people have been vaccinated in Wales? At a press conference where he made the vaccine announcement, Mr Gething said that trying to make long-term forecasts on Covid ""has made a mug of a range of people"". The UK prime minister had suggested restrictions could be lifted in England by21 Junein hislifting lockdown roadmap. In comments criticising the England plans, Mr Gething said predicting what the situation will be like after Easter was more like ""astrology rather than scientific and public health advice"". ""When it comes to a longer term forecasting beyond the middle of April it starts to feel that it's not a sensible approach,"" he said. Rapid testing was also announced for private and public organisations with more than 50 employees. Mr Gething said workplaces that are at higher risk will be prioritised. Targeted community testing will also begin in parts of Bridgend, Merthyr Tydfil and Rhondda Cynon Taf, in a bid to find people with coronavirus who do not have symptoms. Lateral flow tests - plastic devices that aim to give results within half an hour - will be used. There have been more than4.1 million confirmed cases and 121,000 deathsof people with coronavirus in the UK, while in Wales nearly7,300 people have diedandmore than 200,000 have tested positive for Covid. About 18 million people in the UK have had their first Covid jab with878,000 of those in Wales. In Wales, nearly 50,000 have now been given a second dose of the vaccine. Wales has the lowest Covid case rate of any of the UK nations for the last three weeks - with an infection rate of less than 76 cases per 100,000 people. Mr Gething said coronavirus cases in Wales are now at their lowest level since September and thecountry's R numberis between 0.6 and 0.9. The road out of lockdown - in 10 charts Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales His announcement comes as the joint committee on vaccination (JCVI) agreed thatpeople on the learning disability registershould now be prioritised. Under Welsh Government guidance people with learning disabilities, and individuals with schizophrenia, bipolar or mental illnesses which cause functional impairment will be called for vaccination in priority group six. Officials say they are taking an ""inclusion"" approach in identifying those who should be called forward, and they expect this to result in more individuals being prioritised than might otherwise be the case if the JCVI guidance was strictly interpreted. The guidance recommends using GP surgeries rather than mass vaccination centres to administer the vaccines. ""Today really is good news and I hope we will give people lots of comfort that they can expect to be receiving those appointments in the very near future,"" the minister said. Mr Gething is responsible for the vaccination roll out in Wales while the UK government purchases the jabs. Conservative Janet Finch-Saunders said the July target was a ""huge game changer"". But she said expectations will grow as more people were vaccinated and it was ""very disappointing"" that Mr Gething had been ""vague"" about visits to care homes. Plaid Cymru's Delyth Jewell welcomed the announcement that guidance would be issued on prioritising vaccinations for people with learning disabilities or severe mental illness, and also for unpaid carers. However she questioned why the announcement could not have been given to families ""two weeks ago"".

"More than 869,500 people in Wales have been given a first dose of Covid vaccine A solicitor has said her phone has been ""ringing off the hook"" with companies asking if they can refuse to employ someone who has declined a Covid jab. The UK justice secretary has said itmay be legalfor companies to insist new staff are vaccinated. Elissa Thursfield, an employment lawyer at a practice in Denbighshire, said she expected to see employment tribunals over 'no jab, no job' policies. She said employers needed to be able to justify any blanket policy. The Welsh Government said it had no plans to change the law to make vaccinations compulsory. ""The phone has been ringing off the hook with people saying 'we're just worried - we lost residents, we lost staff members during this pandemic,"" said Ms Thursfield, who is head of employment at Gamlins Law in Rhyl. Does Wales have a roadmap out of lockdown? Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? How many people have been vaccinated in Wales? She toldBBC Radio Walesthat employers are saying to her that insisting new staff have the jab ""seems like a really sensible way of controlling"" Covid and firms are asking ""please can we do this?"". Ms Thursfield said with new staff it was ""likely to be a slightly more straightforward legal issue"" but with current staff it would be ""significantly more complex"". ""If you've got someone coming to work in a care home and they're a hands-on carer or a nurse they are going to be having significant close contact with clients at the care home - you can understand why the management would want people to be vaccinated,"" she said. ""However, if you've got somebody who works at home and has absolutely no day-to-day contact with other people, other than by virtual means, then 'no jab no job' will probably be seen to be unreasonable. ""What we're advising companies is make sure that you've looked at your risk assessments, you've decided the reasons why you want people to have the vaccine and how that's going to reduce the risk of Covid in your workplace, so making sure you can justify it before just putting a blanket policy out. ""There's a long process that employers are going to have to go through for existing employees, it's not going to be as simple as if you're not having it, you're out the door."" There have been more than4.1 million confirmed cases and 121,000 deathsof people with coronavirus in the UK, while in Wales at least7,000 people have diedandmore than 200,000 have tested positive for Covid. About 18 million people in the UK have had their first Covid jab with869,500 of those in Wales. In Wales, nearly 50,000 have now been given the full course. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has pledged all adults in the UK will beoffered their first dose of a coronavirus vaccineby the end of July. Boris Johnson has said all adults in the UK will be offered a Covid jab dose by July Ms Thursfield has warned that 'no jab, no job' policies will ""definitely"" lead to tribunals ""Where we think it's going to centre is on discrimination claims,"" she said. ""People who say because of their health, they can't have the immunisation, and if they've been refused a job because of it it's potentially indirect discrimination."" Unions have warned firms it ""may be discriminatory"" and called on governments to make it clear that jabs should not be compulsory. ""The government should make clear that making a vaccination a condition of employment is definitely the wrong approach,"" said Shavanah Taj, General Secretary of trade union Wales TUC. ""It may be discriminatory, it could open up employers to legal and ethical challenges. ""Not everyone will be able to get vaccinated for a range of different reasons, including pregnant workers or people with disabilities, people with particular health conditions."" But the boss of a company that runs a number of care homes across the UK - including in Cardiff, Newport and Blaenau Gwent - said ""it would be a lot easier for me if everybody was vaccinated."" ""The reality is though, should I be forcing people to have it?"" said Tony Stein, chief executive of Healthcare Management Solutions. ""I think if people aren't vaccinated amongst our workforce there's a very strong likelihood we'll be insisting on wearing PPE all the time being tested constantly."" The body that represents more than 450 care homes, nursing homes and social care providers in Wales says people in their profession ""really should have the jab unless there's a very good medical reason why not"". ""There is a suggestionâ¦ it might only be a small percentage but it's significant, of existing care workers who are refusing to have the jab,"" said Care Forum Wales chairman Mario Kreft. ""Then there's the other issues of people in the future, people coming into the sector. ""What Care Forum Wales is saying very clearly is that unless there's a very good medical reason why not, anyone in the future coming into the sector to care for vulnerable people, be it in their own homes or in care homes, they really should have the jab."" The Welsh Government has said the ""overwhelming majority of care home workers"" have had the Covid vaccine. ""Whilst we have no plans to change the law to make vaccinations compulsory,"" a spokesperson said. ""We would urge every eligible adult to take-up the offer of the vaccine when it is their turn.""Â 'No jab, no job' policies may be legal for new staff All UK adults to be offered vaccine by 31 July - PM LA fire chief warns of further destruction from high winds as 10 confirmed dead What's the latest on the LA fires, and why can't they be put out?

"Businesses have called for more clarity on the easing of Covid lockdown restrictions. It comes after thefirst minister set out her plans on Tuesday for the country and businesses to reopenbetween now and April. However, it will be mid-March before more details are spelled out. The Scottish government said non-essential retail, hospitality and services such as gyms and hairdressers would not reopen before 26 April. What Covid rules are changing, and when? Sturgeon unveils 'cautious' route out of lockdown From then, Scotland will return to using a levels system of restrictions, where the level in each area is determined by prevalence of the virus. All parts of the country currently in level four are expected to be able to move back to level three initially. The government has warned there may be some changes to what is allowed in each level. During Wednesday's coronavirus briefing, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she ""desperately wanted"" to give a date for the overall end of lockdown,as the prime minister has donefor 21 June, but said she did not want to give people ""false clarity"". She said: ""If I were to give you a fixed and hard and fast date right now, I would pretty much be making it up and I don't think that's the approach I should take. ""Our approach here is not an outlier and in terms of reopening the economy, we are roughly two weeks behind England."" Tanja Lister of the Kylesku Hotel in Sutherland told the BBC'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme that a return to the levels system would be devastating for business. She said: ""Effectively what we've been given is a route map to another lockdown, because let's be clear - level three for us, which is what's on for April, is actually what closed most hotels in the last part of 2020 so for our industry it's a potential disaster."" Ms Lister added: ""If you were booking a holiday right now somewhere in the UK, you wouldn't book it in Scotland and that's the point. ""If you were looking for a job right now somewhere in the UK, you wouldn't look for it in Scotland. ""We will be left with very very serious problems in the summer is this doesn't change soon."" Ms Lister set up the hospitality and tourism action group, which is campaigning for a UK-wide full unlocking and reopening of the tourism and hospitality industry on 17 May - in line with the date set out for England on Monday. In a statement, the group said the announcement on how the unlocking would take place in Scotland had been met with ""utter dismay, confusion and anger"". It added that the industry in Scotland faced the green shoots of recovery for 2021 dying, adding: ""Rather than cautious hope, the industry now faces widespread cancellations as people make plans to head elsewhere in the UK, recruitment becomes almost impossible."" During her speech on Tuesday, the first minister stressed that Scotland's route out of lockdown was dependent on suppression of the virus. Ms Sturgeon acknowledged that she was being ""deliberately cautious"", but said the pace of easing restrictions would be accelerated if the data supported it. On Monday,Boris Johnson announced that shops, hairdressers, gyms and outdoor hospitality in England could reopen on 12 April. Under a four-step plan to ease lockdown south of the border, all legal limits on social contact could be lifted by 21 June if strict conditions are met. Stephen Montgomery, of the Scottish Hospitality Group, said it was not viable for hospitality businesses to open under level three restrictions. He added that it would be better if hospitality could be given definitive dates for reopening in the spring, like those given in England. ""We know on the 26 April that we're going to be open in some way - that's a date that we can look forward to, but we don't know whether it's going to be outside trading or inside trading, we don't know whether we're going to be serving food, no alcohol, nothing. ""We've got skilled staff to rehire, we have trading to do, we need some dates as indicative as they may be, but something to look forward to."" He also said the 18:00 curfew that was in place under the old system effectively meant stopping taking orders at 16:30, which prevented them effectively operating an evening service. Fiona Campbell, of the Association of Scotland's Self-Caterers, said the Scottish government had ""failed completely"" to set out what the changes would mean for hospitality and tourism businesses. She added: ""What makes this muddle even more disappointing to us, and to Scotland's tourism sector as a whole, is that it effectively means we are lagging behind our colleagues south of the border who already have an indicative date to reopen and as a result have already seen bookings come pouring in for late spring. ""We are now not only having to cancel and refund existing bookings, but we are also having to turn down bookings from south of the border."" She added that the self-catering sector had not yet had any help from sectoral support packages announced in December. Nicola Sturgeon said she wanted to make sure that relaxing restrictions was ""as safe and sustainable as possible"", hence she wanted to be ""cautious, careful and patient for the next period - while the vaccination programme progresses"". She added that she had tried to provide as much clarity as possible, while ""avoiding giving false assurance or picking arbitrary dates that have no grounding at this stage in any objective assessment"". But Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said that the hospitality industry was ""crying out for information"". Mr Ross added: ""They tuned in yesterday to the first minister to hear how we will get out of this, how we can return business to normal, how I'll be able to go round to my parents and give them a hug again - that's what we wanted from the first minister yesterday and we got none of that.

"This video can not be played From trophies to torment - how Lennon's second Celtic stint unfolded Celtic manager Neil Lennon has resigned with his side 18 points adrift of Rangers in the Scottish Premiership. Lennon took charge for a second spell in February 2019 when Brendan Rodgers left and led the club to two titles, two Scottish Cups and a League Cup. However, Celtic are well behind their Glasgow rivals in their bid to win 10-straight titles and slumped to defeat at struggling Ross County on Sunday. Assistant manager John Kennedy will take interim charge of the team. 'Lennon's successes will outlive all of us' The key games that ended Lennon's reign Clarke front-runner to replace Lennon - gossip Podcast: Howe? Martinez? Marsch? Who are the contenders? ""We have experienced a difficult season due to so many factors and it is very frustrating and disappointing that we have not been able to hit the same heights as we did previously,"" Lennon said. ""I have worked as hard as ever to try and turn things around, but unfortunately we have not managed to get the kind of run going that we have needed. ""I have always given my best to the club and have been proud to deliver silverware to the Celtic supporters. The club will always be part of me. I will always be a Celtic supporter myself and I will always want the best for Celtic."" Celtic chief executive Peter Lawwell:""Neil has always been and will always be a true Celtic man and someone I will always hold in the highest regard. Personally, it is a sad day for me to see Neil leave. Neil is a man of quality and decency, he is someone who will always be part of the fabric of Celtic and someone who will always be welcomed.""

Celtic captain Scott Brown:""He's supported Celtic his whole life and he wanted to play for this club - he won a treble as a player, as well as a manager. He's given 15-20 years to this club and he deserves respect, and also praise for what he's done for the club and the success he brought us.

BBC Scotland's sports news correspondent Chris McLaughlin This is something we've been expected for some time, and it comes as a surprise that it hasn't happened before now, even for the man himself. The defeat at Ross County seems to have been the last straw. The Celtic board have been in talks about this over the past few days. Lennon delivered the unprecedented quadruple treble, but he has had major struggles with the side this season and Rangers are now just seven points away from stopping Celtic making it 10 titles in a row. This video can not be played Watch Lennon's last post-match interview as Celtic manager The majority of the fans have been calling for him to step aside for some time now. It will take time for the dust to settle but I would imagine in the next couple of seasons, Celtic fans will look back with fondness on Neil Lennon as both player and manager. Lennon answered Celtic's call in early 2019, when Rodgers departed mid-season for Leicester City, and guided the club to their eighth league crown in a row while securing a third-straight Scottish Cup. After Celtic beat Hearts in the final, he was offered the job on a permanent basis by Lawwell in the Hampden showers. This video can not be played 'Horrific' defending from Celtic - analysis Last season was called early amid the coronavirus pandemic, with Celtic handsomely ahead of Rangers and crowned champions, having also defeated their rivals in the League Cup showpiece. But this term, as the club pursued an unprecedented 10th league title in succession, things unravelled spectacularly. Celtic were eliminated from the second round of Champions League qualifiers at home by Ferencvaros, and won just one of their six Europa League group games. Although they won nine of their opening 10 league fixtures, they lost the first two Old Firm derbies of the term, and dropped points to Aberdeen, Hibernian, St Johnstone and Livingston. Their incredible run of 35 domestic cup wins was ended by Ross County, who prevailed 2-0 at Celtic Park in the League Cup last 16. That led to fan protests and clashes with police outside the stadium. Lennon oversaw more Scottish Cup success in December, as Celtic won the 2019-20 trophy on penalties despite losing a 2-0 lead against Hearts, ensuring the Northern Irishman became the first man to win a treble as player and manager, and sealed a Scottish-first quadruple treble. But the glory was short-lived. Celtic lost at home to St Mirren in January, and despite holding games in hand, remained well shy of Rangers, who are yet to lose a league match this season. Sunday's 1-0 loss to County, who were bottom of the table heading into the fixture, sealed Lennon's fate, with Rangers on the brink of ending their domestic supremacy.

"Secondary schools in England will be asked to consider delivering face-to-face summer schools as part of efforts to help pupils catch up. An extra Â£400m in funding has been announced, along with Â£300m announced for catch-up projects in January. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the money will help ensure ""no child is left behind"" due to the pandemic. Teachers, experts and unions called the money a ""good start"" - but warned about overwhelming pupils and teachers. The prime minister has confirmed all pupils will return to classrooms from 8 March as part of the first step ofa roadmap,externalfor easing England's lockdown. With secondary school pupils being asked to take three Covid-19 tests in school when they come back, it is likely that secondary schools will have to stagger the return over a few days. 5 ways children could make up for lost school time Telling children to catch up 'adds huge pressure' Heads warn against 'grinding out hours' in summer As part of the latest announcements, schools will have the option to run summer classes for pupils who need it most, potentially starting with those who will be moving up to Year 7 at secondary school this year. The government says it will be up to schools to decide how and if they run summer schools, how long they will be, and which pupils will be invited to attend. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said ""we're giving schools the option to be able to draw down on this funding"". He said the average primary school will also receive around Â£6,000 in extra money, with the average secondary school getting around Â£22,000 extra in recovery premium payments. It would be up to head teachers to decide how to use the money - it could be used, for example to pay teachers for overtime to do extra teaching. The government's Â£700m education support package for England includes: A one-off Â£302m ""recovery premium"" for state primary and secondary schools to boost summer schooling, clubs and activities Â£200m to fund face-to-face secondary summer schools, with teachers in charge of deciding which pupils benefit An expanded national tutoring programme for primary and secondary pupils and an extended tuition fund for 16 to 19-year-olds - also worth Â£200m That includes Â£18m funding to support early-years language development This video can not be played Can children catch and spread coronavirus? Last year, Mr Johnson announced a Â£1bn catch-up fund for England, and later appointed Sir Kevan Collins as education recovery commissioner. In Scotland, the administration has promised Â£140m in funding to help disadvantaged pupils. Tens of millions of pounds have also been put into catch-up schemes in Wales and Northern Ireland. The announcement comes as the Treasury has said its levelling-up fund will be extended to the whole of the UK to ""help boost growth"" in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Chief secretary to the Treasury, Stephen Barclay, said communities in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland would now all benefit from at least Â£800m of investment for town centre and high street regeneration, local transport, cultural and heritage projects. On the subject of masks in schools, Mr Williamson said the policy of secondary pupils in England having to wear face coverings in classrooms would be reviewed over the Easter holiays. Most pupils will have to wear face coverings indoors, including in classrooms where social distancing isn't possible. He did not rule out that the policy could remain in place until 21 June, which is the final date in plans to ease lockdown. The government had considered a variety of options for pupils - including extended school days and shorter summer holidays - but neither of these proposals form part of the plan set out on Wednesday. Asked whether extending the school day could be among future measures, Mr Williamson told Sky News: ""We'll be looking at how we can boost and support children in a whole range of different manners. ""But it's not just about time in school it's about supporting teachers in terms of the quality of teaching and how we can help them."" Exams this year have already been cancelled in England, but Mr Williamson said more detail on how grades will be calculated is expected on Thursday. Mother-of-three Emily Ellarby says her children are ""jaded"" by online learning and are ready to be back at school. But she says it would be ""hard to get them motivated"" for more school over the summer. ""They're looking forward to the summer holidays and having a proper break."" She says ultimately children just want to get back to school and normal life. ""They're quite keen to go back, they're looking forward to seeing their friends, they want that normality."" Father-of-two Nick Lee says children and teachers need a proper summer break, not more schooling. ""My children have suffered enough with this pandemic and they will not attend any summer camps. ""We have all struggled to cope in these hard times, and stealing my children's summer is not the way to go."" Nick Lee says he won't be sending his children to summer schools Sarah Baker, who has two children and a stepchild, says she is ""torn"" over the idea of catch-up lessons in the summer. ""They're all at really critical stages in their education, but they're also at critical stages in their personal development. So, I'm completely torn. Yes, of course, they need to catch up, but they also need to regroup."" And Sarah Webb, who has three children aged 11, eight and five, said children need time to recover from the past year, rather than more academic pressure. ""These children have missed out on social interaction and now need time to help readjust and come to terms with their experiences, not being given more time and pressure to bring them back up to academic standards that can simply no longer apply to them."" Kate Green, Labour's shadow education secretary, said the new funding ""will not make up for the learning and time with friends that children have lost"". ""There is no specific mention of supporting children's mental health or wellbeing, which is fundamental to enabling their recovery from this pandemic,"" she said. Labour also calculated the new package was worth less than the Â£840m spent on the Eat Out to Help Out scheme last year, and would be worth 43p per pupil per day, if the money was split across a normal school year. School leaders' unions welcomed the funding but also warned of a long road ahead. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the NAHT - which represents head teachers - said summer schools ""will be of value for some pupils but it will be important not to overwhelm students"". Chris Zarraga, director of Schools North East, said any provision needed to focus on children's ""physical wellbeing, and social and emotional development"", but he also expressed concern about teacher morale. He said asking teachers, who were ""facilitating both in-class teaching and remote learning"", to work over the summer break was likely to ""exacerbate low morale"". By Dan Johnson, BBC News Just working out how to measure what each child has missed during the pandemic is tricky, let alone agreeing on the best way to address it and make sure they all achieve their potential. Many teachers are wary of talking about ""catching-up"" and pupils being ""left behind"" - they do not want to discourage young people. But there is widespread recognition that home learning could never fully replace classroom teaching and some pupils will need significant extra support when they get back to classrooms. The government is backing one-to-one and small group tuition, alongside summer school activities. Suggestions of a longer school day or a shorter summer holiday have not materialised. Many teachers feel they can best assess what their pupils need, but after a relentless year, they are tired and need help in some form. How that help is given and whether it reaches the right pupils will determine the lasting impact on the lives of children who've been through the most difficult school year.

"Hellen Ward, co-founder of beauty salon chain Richard Ward, says her debts have been racking up while her salons have been closed due to Covid restrictions. ""We have worked out it's probably Â£1,000 a day in debt that we have incurred in being closed,"" she said. She is part of a campaign calling on the government to cut VAT to help mend the hair and beauty sector's finances. A survey of salon owners suggests that 56% are considering closing. The Save our Salons campaign group also estimates that nearly four in five will recruit no apprentices this year Any closures would harm the finances of women the most - almost 90% of salon workers are women. The group says there are 45,000 salons providing jobs for nearly 300,000 people. Hairdressers and nail salons are set to re-open from 12 April along with many other retailers. But a long period of closure means they, like many businesses, have been racking up debts. Campaigners say their businesses operate on low profit margins of between 2-5%. ""We urgently need our VAT cut to 5%, the same chop in VAT enjoyed by restaurants and bars since July last year,"" she told the BBC's Today programme. When will I able to go to the pub or get a haircut? Will the roadmap be enough to save businesses? Without help to rebuild their finances, businesses may find it preferable to close their doors, she said. ""We employ such a lot of trainees - where will we be in five years' time if we lose those skill sets?"" she said. Like many businesses, hers and others in the beauty trade have received government help, notably in the form of the furlough scheme, which has paid many staff wages while people have been out of work. ""Furlough has been fantastic but it's not free,"" Ms Ward said. Employers must still make national insurance contributions. Many beauty companies have been paying full rent during the lockdown, despite making little or no income. Most sales come from treatments rather than products, she said. Salon owner Gina Conway says she is holding her breath ahead of the budget Larger salons with lots of employees, big rents and high rates have particularly struggled, says Gina Conway, who owns three hair and beauty salons in London. She opened her first 20 years ago. Her salons have been closed for 238 days in the year since the first lockdown. ""Because hairdressers can't do takeaway or home visits or online haircuts we are all really struggling to cover our costs,"" she told the BBC. She still has to pay rent, insurance and utility bills. Support from her landlord has been mixed. One has offered a discount during the lockdown, one has not replied to her requests and one won't budge.

"This video can not be played Mary Taylor said the man who saved her brother's life was a ""hero"" A passer-by saved a man's life by administering CPR on him for five minutes after he had a cardiac arrest and collapsed. This kept blood flowing around 55-year-old Bobby Gamlin's body until paramedics arrived - but his family were still told to expect the worst. However, after two weeks in intensive care, Mr Gamlin, from Roath, Cardiff, is set to be moved to a cardiac ward. His family want to find the man who helped to thank him. Mr Gamlin's sister Mary Taylor believes he is the reason ""my brother is still here"" and her appeal to find him has been shared more than 700 times on Facebook. Mr Gamlin, who has one son Robert, is set to be moved from intensive care ""He (Bobby) had died. And wouldn't be here if it wasn't for him keeping the blood around his body until the ambulance arrived,"" she said. ""They took him to the Heath (University Hospital of Wales), and it took them an hour to get him back (breathing). ""But that man showed so much bravery, definitely in these unprecedented times with Covid, to go straight to a stranger, to be that brave. There are no words."" Mr Gamlin collapsed near the Home Bargains store on Roath's Albany Road Father-of-one and grandfather-of-two Mr Gamlin had been shopping on Albany Road in Roath with a friend on 11 February when he started feeling dizzy. But as he went to sit down on benches, he collapsed into the plant pots, Mrs Taylor said. ""His friend panicked, but a man passing with his girlfriend said 'I know CPR, do you mind?' and pulled him onto the floor as someone else called an ambulance,"" she added. ""It's so easy to not know what to do, so I dread what to think would have happened if he wasn't there."" The ambulance arrived in about five minutes - but Mr Gamlin had stopped breathing and the man battled alone to keep blood circulating around his body until paramedics could take over. Mr Gamlin - pictured with his late partner - had been out shopping Even so, after being taken to the city's University Hospital of Wales, it took doctors an hour to get him breathing, with his family told by doctors to expect the worst. Mrs Taylor said relatives, who were unable to visit because of Covid restrictions, were informed Mr Gamlin could be left with brain damage or may not even make it, as he was treated in intensive care. Mr Gamlin's family, including sisters Mary, Teresa and Julie, had feared the worst ""He has confounded everyone, they didn't expect him to live,"" Mrs Taylor added. ""He will probably need surgery but compared to before, he is now sat in a chair and could eat a meal and drink himself yesterday - he was fed by a tube before. ""He is also able to send messages on his phone now."" Mr Gamlin is set to leave intensive care for a cardiac ward on Thursday, and Mrs Taylor wants to find the man, in his 20s, who saved him, saying ""we owe him everything"". The Welsh Ambulance Service did not comment on the specific case but said ""time is always of the essence"" when dealing with cardiac arrests and urged everyone to learn ""these life-saving skills"". Robert Brunnock, manager for Cardiff, said: ""When it comes to cardiac arrests, time is always of the essence. ""As an emergency service, our utmost priority will always be to arrive at the scene of an incident as quickly as possible. ""However, the earlier CPR is performed on a patient suffering from cardiac arrest, the better.""

"The US has pledged to donate 500 million more doses of the Pfizer vaccine to poorer nations from next year - bringing its total commitment to more than one billion. ""To beat the pandemic here, we need to beat it everywhere,"" US President Joe Biden told a virtual Covid-19 summit. The donation will be routed through Covax - the international scheme designed to ensure low-income countries aren't left behind in the fight against Covid. It came amid growing warnings over the pace of global vaccinations, and inequity of access. Covax,externalwas created last year to ensure that Covid vaccines are made available around the world, with richer countries subsidising costs for poorer nations. The scheme hopes to distribute enough vaccines to protect at least 20% of the population in 92 low- or medium-income countries - starting with healthcare workers and the most vulnerable groups. Its initial goal was to provide two billion doses of vaccines worldwide in 2021, and 1.8 billion doses to 92 poorer countries by early 2022. Covax is run by a number of international organisations, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the UN children's charity, Unicef. Ghana was the first country to receive Covax vaccines in February. Since then, more than 303 million doses have been shipped through Covax to 142 countries around the world, including Bangladesh, Brazil, Ethiopia and Fiji. Most doses are going to poorer countries, but some have been sent to wealthier countries such as Canada,which defended its request. Covid vaccines: How fast is worldwide progress? Covid map: Where are cases the highest? Covax works with with governments and vaccine manufacturers around the world. Supporters include the US, the UK, Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, the UAE, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden, and Portugal. Countries have pledged to donate both money and surplus doses from their own vaccine supplies. The US joined Covax after President Biden took office in January 2021 The UK, Japan, Canada and the European Union are among those to have committed to supplying tens of millions of doses. WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus previously criticised wealthier nations for ""gobbling up"" the global vaccine supply. G7 countries have purchased over a third of the world's vaccine supply, despite making up only 13% of the global population. Six vaccines have been given ""emergency use authorisation"" by the WHO, meaning they can be shared via Covax: AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Janssen, Moderna, Sinopharm and Sinovac. However, only Pfizer and AstraZeneca doses have been delivered so far. Moderna has agreed to supply 500 million doses at its ""lowest-tiered price"", but most won't be available until 2022. Covax has been criticised for being slow. Some initial targets were missed, partly as a result of the poor health infrastructure in many of the recipient countries, and partly because of vaccine hesitancy. Covax supplied AstraZeneca Covid vaccines arriving in Madagascar in May 2021 Deliveries were also delayed because of the deteriorating situation in India. Officials thererestricted exports to protect their own populationamid soaring infection rates. Theseare set to resume from October. Covax has told the BBC that too many donations have come in small quantities, at the last minute and with little time left before they expire. This makes it very hard to get them to where they are needed. Representatives of the scheme also note that only a small percentage of the pledges made earlier this year have turned into actual doses. Unicef executive director Henrietta Fore said countries needed to ""accelerate their donation plans"", with low-income nations unable to wait any longer. While many high-income countries have now given at least one shot to more than half their populations, only 2% of people in low-income countries have had their first dose, according to data from the University of Oxford. Covax says it is now expecting to hit its ""key milestone"" of releasing two billion doses for delivery some time early next year. Why are vaccines being destroyed in Africa? Will countries be left behind in the vaccine race? In total, some six billion doses of coronavirus vaccines have been administered, in over 195 countries worldwide. However, while some countries have fully vaccinated a large amount of their population, many others have only just begun, or in some cases are still waiting for their first doses to arrive. Covax aims to close that gap. ""With a fast-moving pandemic, no one is safe, unless everyone is safe,"" the WHO says on its website. But even if Covax meets its goal to vaccinate 20% of the population in its 92 target countries, that's well short of the level of immunity that experts say is needed to end the pandemic. The WHO has suggested that figure is at least 70%. People may also need booster doses to remain protected.

"The WHO and Unicef said the delivery was a momentous occasion Ghana has become the first country to receive coronavirus vaccines through the Covax vaccine-sharing initiative. A delivery of 600,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine arrived in Accra on Wednesday. The first recipients are due to be healthcare workers. The Covax scheme aims to reduce the divide between rich countries and poorer nations unable to buy doses. The programme is planning to deliver about two billion vaccine doses globally by the end of the year. Ghana, which has a population of over 30m, was chosen as the first recipient of the free vaccines after promising quick distribution and meeting the criteria set by Covax. Further deliveries are expected to neighbouring Ivory Coast later this week, the Covax alliance says. Vaccinations are expected to start in Ghana next week, and, as well as health workers, those over 60, people with underlying health conditions, and senior officials are due to be prioritised. The vaccines delivered to Accra were produced by the Serum Institute of India and developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University. The vaccine has been approved by the World Health Organization (WHO) and its roll-out in Ghana is not part of a trial. The doses being sent to lower-income countries such as Ghana are funded by donations. As well as procuring and delivering the vaccines, Covax partners are supporting local authorities in areas such as training people to administer the jabs and helping provide an adequate cold-chain storage and delivery system.       Source: Our World in Data  Many nations in the developed world, which began their own vaccinations months ago, have faced criticism for buying or ordering more vaccines than they need. But many of those countries placed orders for doses with pharmaceutical companies before knowing whether the vaccine in development would be effective. They were hedging their bets - placing multiple orders in the hope that at least some of them would work out. The UK, which has ordered 400 million vaccine doses and will have many left over, has said itwill donate most of its surplus vaccine supply to poorer countries.

These numbers are believed to fall short of the actual toll because of low levels of testing. Though the vaccines are not generally intended for children, Unicef is involved in the scheme because of its expertise in procurement and the logistics of vaccine delivery. The Covax scheme was set up by the WHO, the Gavi vaccines alliance and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) to try to prevent poorer countries from being pushed to the back of the queue. The programme is designed so that richer countries buying vaccines agree to help finance access for poorer nations, too. It hopes to deliver more than two billion doses to people in 190 countries in less than a year. In particular, it wants to ensure 92 poorer countries will receive access to vaccines at the same time as 98 wealthier countries. The AstraZeneca vaccine is known as Covishield in India, where the doses delivered to Ghana were made It aims to reach up to 20% of the populations of poorer countries, at no cost to their governments. Most African countries are intended recipients of Covax, buta number of them such as Senegal have been making provisions for vaccines outside the initiative. Commenting on Wednesday's first shipment, the Director-General of the WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said it was a major first step but just the beginning. ""We will not end the pandemic anywhere unless we end it everywhere"", he added. Coronavirus cases, deaths, vaccinations by country Analysis by BBC Africa health editor Anne Mawathe The arrival of the first Covax vaccines in Ghana follows sharp criticism that African countries could be left behind in the fight against Covid-19. Western countries have been condemned for their rush to purchase more vaccines than they needed, leaving little left over for the rest of the world. But this is just a start. Ghana, a country with a population of about 31 million people, has now got a total of 600,000 doses of the vaccine. Africa, a continent with about 1.4 billion people, is largely still waiting on Covax to deliver. It is unlikely that many governments on the continent will go to the market and fight it out with countries with more financial muscle. In fact, most African countries will be buying the vaccines at a higher price than their Western counterparts, partly because they didn't pre-order. Some have called for the big pharmaceutical companies to stop blocking a patent waiver, which would lead to lower prices and mean more vaccine would be produced. But the companies have not agreed to this, knowing it could dent any profit margin. Covax has so far raised $6bn (Â£4.3bn), but says it needs at least another $2bn to meet its target for 2021. The scheme has faced some criticism for not moving quickly enough. One WHO board member, Austria's Dr Clemens Martin Auer, said it had been slow to secure vaccine deals and deliver doses. The joint statement on Wednesday said the shipment to Ghana represented ""the beginning of what should be the largest vaccine procurement and supply operation in history"". Nana Kofi Quakyi, who is a health policy research fellow at New York University's School of Global Public Health, told the BBC that Ghana would still struggle to compete with wealthier nations to make up the shortfall in doses it needed to find, even with the Covax initiative. ""The challenge that countries like Ghana are having is that in an open market, our bargaining power for bilateral deals is just not competitive against other wealthier countries that... in some cases, are buying more than they even need.""

"Only eight African countries out of more than 50 have a compulsory system to register deaths, a BBC investigation has found. This is not just a failure of the state to recognise individual tragedies but has enormous implications for the making of government policy. All but two countries in Europe - Albania and Monaco - have a universal death registration system, and in Asia, just over half, analysis of UN data shows. But in Africa it is only Egypt, South Africa, Tunisia, Algeria, Cape Verde, SÃ£o TomÃ© and PrÃ­ncipe, Seychelles and Mauritius that have what are called functioning, compulsory and universal civil registration systems - known as CRVS systems - which record deaths. All of the countries surveyed by the BBC, working with researchers from the UN's Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA), do have some sort of death registration. But it is often on paper and not available in a shareable digitised form. The information may be used in a local area but cannot calculate mortality trends on a national level. In the wake of the Ebola epidemic, and now Covid-19, having an accurate picture of who is dying, from what and where, is crucial when it comes to allocating resources and funding. This also has implications for tracking maternal and child mortality as there are children whose birth and untimely death go unrecorded. This not only robs them of a ""right to an identity"", in the words of William Muhwava - the head of demography at the UNECA based in Addis Ababa - it also means that lessons are not learnt. ""In order to help the living, we need to count the dead,"" UN Population Fund demographer Romesh Silva told the BBC. Those who are missed out on the registers are often the poorest and socially excluded, he adds, and the absence of information about their deaths means that measures to deal with the causes are sometimes not taken. ""Despite investments, CRVS systems remain dysfunctional, forcing governments to rely on surveys... which by the time they are published are already outdated,"" says Irina Dincu, from the Centre of Excellence for CRVS systems. South Africa has the highest Covid death toll in Africa - according to official figures When it comes to coronavirus there is a concern that its true extent in some countries is not fully understood. It has been widely reported that Africa's Covid-19 death toll is far lower than in other parts of the world. Live tracker: Covid in Africa Expertise in epidemic control, a swift response in some countries, the relatively young population and cross-immunity from other coronaviruses are all thought to have had an impact. But data scientists say that calculating a key indicator of the pandemic's fallout - known as ""excess deaths"" - is impossible in most countries because of the lack of CRVS systems. Excess deaths is a measure which compares the actual deaths over a period of time with the number of deaths expected based on the same period in previous years. But it relies on the full registration of deaths. Looking at excess deaths gives a sense of the overall loss of life caused directly by Covid-19. It also shows deaths caused indirectly by the pandemic because of factors such as overstretched health systems, fear of attending hospital and an economic downturn. A Lancet study across 118 low-income and middle-income countries estimated that the continued disruption of health systems from Covid-19 could result in 1,157,000 additional child deaths and 56,700 additional maternal deaths. South Africa and Egypt are among the eight countries which do have functioning death registers, so calculating excess deaths in both countries is possible, and the results are telling. By early February, South Africa had recorded nearly 138,000 excess deaths since the pandemic began - that is almost three times the official figure given for Covid-19 deaths. To break it down: 46,200 of these people were officially recorded as having died with coronavirus and there are death certificates to prove it. This means the other 91,500 were either undiagnosed, or died as an indirect consequence of the pandemic such as delayed cancer treatment or fear of going to hospital. At the height of the pandemic in late last July, South Africa experienced 54% more deaths than was expected for that time period. Although when the lockdown was first imposed, fewer deaths were recorded than normal, presumably because of fewer cases of alcohol-related violence and road accidents. Thanks to Egypt's comprehensive registration system, it is possible to calculate that there were more than 68,000 excess deaths between May and August last year. In June, the number of recorded deaths was almost double what would usually be expected. On average, official Covid-19 deaths made up under 10% of those additional losses. But for most countries on the continent there is no way to reach any conclusions like this as the data is so sparse. In 14 countries a maximum of only one in 10 deaths are recorded, including in Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Cameroon. Over half of the countries in sub-Saharan Africa only keep handwritten death records. Certain states, such as Eritrea and Burundi, have no legal requirement to register or collate deaths at all. Eritrea has recorded only seven Covid-19 death to date and Burundi, just three, although there was speculation that the virus was a contributing factor in the unexpected death of Burundi's former President Pierre Nkurunziza last year. This video can not be played Fake news and mistrust in the government mean a lot of Nigeria's population thinks the pandemic is a hoax. Nigeria, Africa's most populous country, recorded only 10% of all deaths in 2017. The pandemic further ""paralysed all the civil registration activities"" in the country, which were not deemed an essential service, according to a UN report in April 2020. This could explain why the number of Covid-19 deaths per million people remains relatively low there. Nigeria has recorded nine Covid-19 deaths per million, compared to the global average of 316. Meanwhile, South Africa has recorded 827 Covid-19 deaths per million and Tunisia 659 - the two highest in Africa. But it is important to take into account that these countries have good registers that capture most deaths - 92% and 95% of the population, respectively. The BBC and UNECA's research has created the most up to date and comprehensive assessments of the death registration systems on the continent. It was also discovered that many countries are making progress in bridging the data gap. The Central African Republic (CAR) has one of the lowest performing CRVS systems on the continent following years of conflict, which is still ongoing. In 2017 only 2% of estimated deaths were registered in the country. Twice as many male deaths were recorded as female -  and then only in the capital, Bangui, and its outskirts. Elvis Franck Matkoss, head of the statistics department at the Ministry of Economy, Planning and Co-operation, told the BBC that ""the government attaches particular importance to CRVS and its fundamental role in promoting good governance"". He added that the CAR was making great efforts to improve on its 2% coverage through the modernisation of registration centres and the creation of a more centralised system. Mr Matkoss said the government was also providing funding to help communities register their dead, as well as promoting free birth certificates for all children. Senegal and Rwanda are both working with a US non-profit organisation, Vital Strategies, to put together historic mortality data that can be compared to deaths during the pandemic - using a method called ""rapid mortality surveillance"". Five other countries - Togo, Burkina Faso, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Ghana - are working with the African Field Epidemiology Network to do the same. Chad and Liberia are asking community health workers to notify the authorities about deaths that occur outside of hospitals. They are using ""verbal autopsies"" - interviewing next of kin about the deceased - a low-cost solution to understand major causes of death in a specific region. Some countries are using mobile technology to collect, manage and archive data about deaths. In Rwanda and Mozambique, people can use smartphones to register deaths on an electronic system, allowing relatives to report deaths while socially distancing. In Uganda, the Civil Registration Office has set up the Mobile Vital Records System for the registration of births and deaths in health centres and at a community level. Over the next decade, data scientists hope this kind of innovation will help more countries on the continent to reach their universal death registration targets. The BBC's research has highlighted some of the problems and the UNECA's Mr Muhwava said that it had brought ""to the fore the challenges that CRVS systems in Africa face in documenting death events"".

"Businesses have called for more clarity on the easing of Covid lockdown restrictions. It comes after thefirst minister set out her plans on Tuesday for the country and businesses to reopenbetween now and April. However, it will be mid-March before more details are spelled out. The Scottish government said non-essential retail, hospitality and services such as gyms and hairdressers would not reopen before 26 April. What Covid rules are changing, and when? Sturgeon unveils 'cautious' route out of lockdown From then, Scotland will return to using a levels system of restrictions, where the level in each area is determined by prevalence of the virus. All parts of the country currently in level four are expected to be able to move back to level three initially. The government has warned there may be some changes to what is allowed in each level. During Wednesday's coronavirus briefing, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she ""desperately wanted"" to give a date for the overall end of lockdown,as the prime minister has donefor 21 June, but said she did not want to give people ""false clarity"". She said: ""If I were to give you a fixed and hard and fast date right now, I would pretty much be making it up and I don't think that's the approach I should take. ""Our approach here is not an outlier and in terms of reopening the economy, we are roughly two weeks behind England."" Tanja Lister of the Kylesku Hotel in Sutherland told the BBC'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme that a return to the levels system would be devastating for business. She said: ""Effectively what we've been given is a route map to another lockdown, because let's be clear - level three for us, which is what's on for April, is actually what closed most hotels in the last part of 2020 so for our industry it's a potential disaster."" Ms Lister added: ""If you were booking a holiday right now somewhere in the UK, you wouldn't book it in Scotland and that's the point. ""If you were looking for a job right now somewhere in the UK, you wouldn't look for it in Scotland. ""We will be left with very very serious problems in the summer is this doesn't change soon."" Ms Lister set up the hospitality and tourism action group, which is campaigning for a UK-wide full unlocking and reopening of the tourism and hospitality industry on 17 May - in line with the date set out for England on Monday. In a statement, the group said the announcement on how the unlocking would take place in Scotland had been met with ""utter dismay, confusion and anger"". It added that the industry in Scotland faced the green shoots of recovery for 2021 dying, adding: ""Rather than cautious hope, the industry now faces widespread cancellations as people make plans to head elsewhere in the UK, recruitment becomes almost impossible."" During her speech on Tuesday, the first minister stressed that Scotland's route out of lockdown was dependent on suppression of the virus. Ms Sturgeon acknowledged that she was being ""deliberately cautious"", but said the pace of easing restrictions would be accelerated if the data supported it. On Monday,Boris Johnson announced that shops, hairdressers, gyms and outdoor hospitality in England could reopen on 12 April. Under a four-step plan to ease lockdown south of the border, all legal limits on social contact could be lifted by 21 June if strict conditions are met. Stephen Montgomery, of the Scottish Hospitality Group, said it was not viable for hospitality businesses to open under level three restrictions. He added that it would be better if hospitality could be given definitive dates for reopening in the spring, like those given in England. ""We know on the 26 April that we're going to be open in some way - that's a date that we can look forward to, but we don't know whether it's going to be outside trading or inside trading, we don't know whether we're going to be serving food, no alcohol, nothing. ""We've got skilled staff to rehire, we have trading to do, we need some dates as indicative as they may be, but something to look forward to."" He also said the 18:00 curfew that was in place under the old system effectively meant stopping taking orders at 16:30, which prevented them effectively operating an evening service. Fiona Campbell, of the Association of Scotland's Self-Caterers, said the Scottish government had ""failed completely"" to set out what the changes would mean for hospitality and tourism businesses. She added: ""What makes this muddle even more disappointing to us, and to Scotland's tourism sector as a whole, is that it effectively means we are lagging behind our colleagues south of the border who already have an indicative date to reopen and as a result have already seen bookings come pouring in for late spring. ""We are now not only having to cancel and refund existing bookings, but we are also having to turn down bookings from south of the border."" She added that the self-catering sector had not yet had any help from sectoral support packages announced in December. Nicola Sturgeon said she wanted to make sure that relaxing restrictions was ""as safe and sustainable as possible"", hence she wanted to be ""cautious, careful and patient for the next period - while the vaccination programme progresses"". She added that she had tried to provide as much clarity as possible, while ""avoiding giving false assurance or picking arbitrary dates that have no grounding at this stage in any objective assessment"". But Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said that the hospitality industry was ""crying out for information"". Mr Ross added: ""They tuned in yesterday to the first minister to hear how we will get out of this, how we can return business to normal, how I'll be able to go round to my parents and give them a hug again - that's what we wanted from the first minister yesterday and we got none of that.

"Apple chief executive Tim Cook Apple has acquired about 100 companies over the last six years, the companyâs chief executive Tim Cook has revealed. That works out at a company every three to four weeks, he told Appleâs annual meeting of shareholders on Tuesday. Apple recently delivered its largest quarter by revenue of all time, bringing in $111.4bn (Â£78.7bn) in the first-quarter of its fiscal year 2021. Mr Cook told the shareholders meeting that the acquisitions are mostly aimed at acquiring technology and talent. Chromebook users overtake Macs for first time The carmaker aiming to become a tech firm Apple users targeted by 'mysterious' malware Apple's largest acquisition in the last decade was its $3bn purchase of Beats Electronics, the headphone maker founded by rapper and producer Dr Dre. Another high profile purchase was music recognition software company Shazam, for $400m in 2018. Most often, Apple buys smaller technology firms and then incorporates their innovations into its own products. One example is PrimeSense, an Israeli 3D sensing company whose technology contributed to Appleâs FaceID. Apple has also invested in back-end technology that wouldnât be so obvious to iPhone or Macbook users. Apple's list of acquisitions and investments is extremely varied. In the past year, Apple has bought several artificial intelligence (AI) companies, a virtual reality events business, a payments startup and a podcast business, among others. In 2019, Apple bought Drive.ai, a self-driving shuttle firm, in an effort to boost its own foray into self-driving technologies. This video can not be played WATCH: Who are the 'big four' and just how much power do they have? In 2016, the company also took a $1bn stake in Chinese ride-hailing service Didi Chuxing, although it wasnât a controlling interest. Apple is an immensely profitable juggernaut worth more than $2trn, so it has plenty of money to make acquisitions. But even if it has bought 100 companies in six years, Apple appears to be very selective about what it buys. For example, Tesla founder Elon Musk recently revealed that he approached Mr Cook to buy the electric car business when it was struggling in 2013. Mr Cook didn't take the meeting, Mr Musk said. Measured by value, Appleâs acquisitions are actually far more restrained than those of many of its tech rivals. Microsoft paid $26bn for LinkedIn, Amazon paid $13.7bn for Whole Foods and Facebook paid $19bn for WhatsApp. Appleâs ten largest purchases put together would still be worth far less than any of those deals.

"Secondary schools in England will be asked to consider delivering face-to-face summer schools as part of efforts to help pupils catch up. An extra Â£400m in funding has been announced, along with Â£300m announced for catch-up projects in January. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the money will help ensure ""no child is left behind"" due to the pandemic. Teachers, experts and unions called the money a ""good start"" - but warned about overwhelming pupils and teachers. The prime minister has confirmed all pupils will return to classrooms from 8 March as part of the first step ofa roadmap,externalfor easing England's lockdown. With secondary school pupils being asked to take three Covid-19 tests in school when they come back, it is likely that secondary schools will have to stagger the return over a few days. 5 ways children could make up for lost school time Telling children to catch up 'adds huge pressure' Heads warn against 'grinding out hours' in summer As part of the latest announcements, schools will have the option to run summer classes for pupils who need it most, potentially starting with those who will be moving up to Year 7 at secondary school this year. The government says it will be up to schools to decide how and if they run summer schools, how long they will be, and which pupils will be invited to attend. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said ""we're giving schools the option to be able to draw down on this funding"". He said the average primary school will also receive around Â£6,000 in extra money, with the average secondary school getting around Â£22,000 extra in recovery premium payments. It would be up to head teachers to decide how to use the money - it could be used, for example to pay teachers for overtime to do extra teaching. The government's Â£700m education support package for England includes: A one-off Â£302m ""recovery premium"" for state primary and secondary schools to boost summer schooling, clubs and activities Â£200m to fund face-to-face secondary summer schools, with teachers in charge of deciding which pupils benefit An expanded national tutoring programme for primary and secondary pupils and an extended tuition fund for 16 to 19-year-olds - also worth Â£200m That includes Â£18m funding to support early-years language development This video can not be played Can children catch and spread coronavirus? Last year, Mr Johnson announced a Â£1bn catch-up fund for England, and later appointed Sir Kevan Collins as education recovery commissioner. In Scotland, the administration has promised Â£140m in funding to help disadvantaged pupils. Tens of millions of pounds have also been put into catch-up schemes in Wales and Northern Ireland. The announcement comes as the Treasury has said its levelling-up fund will be extended to the whole of the UK to ""help boost growth"" in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Chief secretary to the Treasury, Stephen Barclay, said communities in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland would now all benefit from at least Â£800m of investment for town centre and high street regeneration, local transport, cultural and heritage projects. On the subject of masks in schools, Mr Williamson said the policy of secondary pupils in England having to wear face coverings in classrooms would be reviewed over the Easter holiays. Most pupils will have to wear face coverings indoors, including in classrooms where social distancing isn't possible. He did not rule out that the policy could remain in place until 21 June, which is the final date in plans to ease lockdown. The government had considered a variety of options for pupils - including extended school days and shorter summer holidays - but neither of these proposals form part of the plan set out on Wednesday. Asked whether extending the school day could be among future measures, Mr Williamson told Sky News: ""We'll be looking at how we can boost and support children in a whole range of different manners. ""But it's not just about time in school it's about supporting teachers in terms of the quality of teaching and how we can help them."" Exams this year have already been cancelled in England, but Mr Williamson said more detail on how grades will be calculated is expected on Thursday. Mother-of-three Emily Ellarby says her children are ""jaded"" by online learning and are ready to be back at school. But she says it would be ""hard to get them motivated"" for more school over the summer. ""They're looking forward to the summer holidays and having a proper break."" She says ultimately children just want to get back to school and normal life. ""They're quite keen to go back, they're looking forward to seeing their friends, they want that normality."" Father-of-two Nick Lee says children and teachers need a proper summer break, not more schooling. ""My children have suffered enough with this pandemic and they will not attend any summer camps. ""We have all struggled to cope in these hard times, and stealing my children's summer is not the way to go."" Nick Lee says he won't be sending his children to summer schools Sarah Baker, who has two children and a stepchild, says she is ""torn"" over the idea of catch-up lessons in the summer. ""They're all at really critical stages in their education, but they're also at critical stages in their personal development. So, I'm completely torn. Yes, of course, they need to catch up, but they also need to regroup."" And Sarah Webb, who has three children aged 11, eight and five, said children need time to recover from the past year, rather than more academic pressure. ""These children have missed out on social interaction and now need time to help readjust and come to terms with their experiences, not being given more time and pressure to bring them back up to academic standards that can simply no longer apply to them."" Kate Green, Labour's shadow education secretary, said the new funding ""will not make up for the learning and time with friends that children have lost"". ""There is no specific mention of supporting children's mental health or wellbeing, which is fundamental to enabling their recovery from this pandemic,"" she said. Labour also calculated the new package was worth less than the Â£840m spent on the Eat Out to Help Out scheme last year, and would be worth 43p per pupil per day, if the money was split across a normal school year. School leaders' unions welcomed the funding but also warned of a long road ahead. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the NAHT - which represents head teachers - said summer schools ""will be of value for some pupils but it will be important not to overwhelm students"". Chris Zarraga, director of Schools North East, said any provision needed to focus on children's ""physical wellbeing, and social and emotional development"", but he also expressed concern about teacher morale. He said asking teachers, who were ""facilitating both in-class teaching and remote learning"", to work over the summer break was likely to ""exacerbate low morale"". By Dan Johnson, BBC News Just working out how to measure what each child has missed during the pandemic is tricky, let alone agreeing on the best way to address it and make sure they all achieve their potential. Many teachers are wary of talking about ""catching-up"" and pupils being ""left behind"" - they do not want to discourage young people. But there is widespread recognition that home learning could never fully replace classroom teaching and some pupils will need significant extra support when they get back to classrooms. The government is backing one-to-one and small group tuition, alongside summer school activities. Suggestions of a longer school day or a shorter summer holiday have not materialised. Many teachers feel they can best assess what their pupils need, but after a relentless year, they are tired and need help in some form. How that help is given and whether it reaches the right pupils will determine the lasting impact on the lives of children who've been through the most difficult school year.

"Health Minister Vaughan Gething has been giving a Welsh Government update on the pandemic He says all adults in Wales will have been offered a first Covid jab by 31 July subject to supplies matching targets Another 13 people have died with Covid in Wales, taking the official total to 5,263, according to Public Health Wales A woman whose husband died nearly a year after they were last able to hold hands says the ban on indoor care home visits is 'a form of cruelty' A solicitor says she is being inundated with calls from firms asking if they can refuse to employ someone who has declined a Covid jab Nicola Bryan and Andy Roberts That's it for our live coverage of the Welsh Government's update on the pandemic. Here's a recap on the main developments so far today:  You can follow coverage of this afternoon's proceedings in the Welsh Parliament via ourSenedd Liveblog. Have a good afternoon, and stay safe. Daniel DaviesBBC Wales political correspondent Education Minister Kirsty Williams says sending all children back to school at once would pile pressure on the NHS. Under current plans, the final group of secondary school pupils will not be back in schooluntil the summer term starts on 12 April, although the youngest primary school children have begun to return this week. In England, all age groups are due to return on March 8. However, during a visit to a primary school in Cardiff, Ms Williams insisted the Welsh Government was following scientific advice. âWe've been advised if you bring all children back in one big bang that potentially has a massive effect on the R number [infection rate],"" she said. âWe will see [Covid case] rates begin to climb again and we will see extra pressure being put back on our NHS. âNobody wants to go there. That's why we are doing it carefully and cautiously.â Ms Williams added she would âwelcome a discussionâ on changing the academic year in the wake of the pandemic. Shorter summer holidays and longer breaks in the autumn and Christmas âactually might be a more appropriate way to organise the school yearâ, she said. Kirsty Williams: ""We are doing it carefully and cautiously"" Of the latest 13 deaths withm Covid in Wales, six were reported by Betsi Cadwaladr health board, which provides NHS services in north Wales. There were two deaths reported by Cwm Taf Morgannwg in south Wales, and two by Hywel Dda which serves west Wales. One death was reported by the boards for Swansea Bay, Cardiff and Vale, and Aneurin Bevan, which covers south east Wales. The news that all adults in Wales will be offered the coronavirus vaccine by the end of July is a ""huge game-changer,"" Welsh Conservative Janet Finch-Saunders says. The member of the Senedd (MS) for Aberconwy said as more people were vaccinated ""so too will those expectations grow"". Ms Finch-Saunders said it was ""very disappointing"" that Health Minister Vaughan Gething had been ""vague"" in the news conference about visits to care homes. ""People have really suffered as a result of not seeing their loved ones who are very vulnerable in those care homes,"" she told BBC Wales. ""England have already made the announcements about visits being allowed in March."" Plaid Cymru has welcomed the health minister's announcement that there will be guidance issued on prioritising vaccinations in Wales for people with learning disabilities, severe mental illness and unpaid carers. Member of the Senedd (MS) Delyth Jewell said it could ""make a huge difference"", adding: ""This is a really exciting day for all the campaigners who have been fighting so hard for this change in policy."" She told BBC Wales: ""If we look at the number of care home residents with learning disabilities - we're talking about maybe 3,500 people - that would be around 10% of the vaccinations given any day in Wales."" Ms Jewell said she had been campaigning for this for ""a number of weeks"" but questioned ""why the certainty couldn't have been given to families two weeks ago"". Attempting to give long-term forecasts about emerging out of the pandemic has ""made a mug of a range of people,"" Health Minister Vaughan Gething says. He said ""forecasting much further into the future"" was ""fraught with difficulty and uncertainty"" which was ""getting into something that is more like astrology than science and public health advice"". ""Whether itâs âcoronavirus sent packing in 12 weeksâ, âa vaccine by Septemberâ or âreturn to normality by Decemberâ, all of those things have proven to be long-term punts that havenât fared well with reality,"" Mr Gething said. âWeâre doing something that is forecasting a reasonable amount into the future, with a three-week review. ""Weâll be up front about what that means, what the next review might mean as well, to give people enough time to get used to the practical progress weâre making."" The UK governmentâs decision to reopen schools to all children in England at the same time is not in line with medical and scientific advice, Health Minister Vaughan Gething says. He said it was in contrast with the Welsh Governmentâs policy of a phased school reopening. âThe advice from the chief medical officers and scientific evidence advice isnât really any different within the UK,â he said. âWhat England have chosen to do though is theyâve chosen to move away from the advice of having a more phased approach to school reopening, but to have a âbig bangâ reopening on 8 March. âThe consequence of that is theyâre having to have a bigger gap between that intervention and when theyâre next contemplating doing something else."" Health Minister Vaughan Gething said he was expecting more guidance to be issued by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) in the next few days about the prioritisation of jabs for under-50s. âWe have asked questions as indeed have other governments in the UK about whether there should prioritisation within that,"" he said. On the latest advice from the JCVI that people registered with learning disabilities should be prioritised in group six for jabs, Mr Gething said he would follow guidance suggesting the use of GP registers to identify people. He said he would be working with GP practises to make sure âthe GP registers actually cover all the people  weâd want to see coveredâ. The pandemic has seen a ""huge leap forward"" in the way services for people's mental and physical health are provided in Wales, according to the health minister. Vaughan Gething said the ""necessity of doing that"" in the current circumstances meant ""we're going to have a better way to deliver a range of our services into the future"". He said before the pandemic the Welsh Government had ""invested lots"" in ""tier zero services"" - the ""lowest level of intervention"" that ""make a really big difference to help support, sustain and improve people's wellbeing"". This approach was to avoid these people going on to need services for more serious mental ill-health, Mr Gething said. The minister said other measures had included a scheme addressing the impact of mental health concerns  for children and young people. It was ""undeniable that we've seen real improvements in mental health provision over the course of this [Senedd] term"", he added. The Welsh Governmentâs upcoming budget will take account of extra strains put on peopleâs mental health because of the pandemic, according to the health minister. Vaughan Gething said considerably more money was already being put in to support mental health services in Wales, and pledged that this would continue into the next financial year. âAs weâre putting more money into those services in a variety of different ways, the money weâre planning to put into the budget in the next year will need to account for the increase in the mental health needs that weâve already seen and will continue to see,â he said. âThereâs a range of different strands and [the Minister for Mental Health] Eluned Morgan will be providing more information before we get to the end of March about what we expect to do with the money in our budget. âWeâll also then be able to take account of any further announcements made in the UK budget announced on 3 March,â he added. The Welsh Government is publishing guidance that will âhelp support vaccine uptake for unpaid carers and people with learning disabilities or severe mental illnessâ, Health Minister Vaughan Gething says. He said it would âtake into accountâ the latest advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI). Mr Gething said the guidance would explain who in these groups is eligible for vaccine prioritisation and explain how to identify, contact and support people to access their vaccine. âUnpaid carers and those with learning disabilities and severe mental illness is a large group, and it may take some time for NHS Wales to offer appointments to everyone,â he said. âBut please be assured that our NHS is working as quickly as possible and nobody will be left behind."" Priority groups five to nine are now being vaccinated against coronavirus, according to Health Minister Vaughan Gething. He said: âThat is everyone aged 50 to 69, everyone aged over 16 with an underlying health condition that puts them at increased risk of serious illness with coronavirus, and many of our invaluable unpaid carers who provide care for someone who is clinically vulnerable to the virus."" Mr Gething added: âSubject to vaccine supply, we will have reached all these people by the middle of April.â All eligible adults in Wales will be offereda first coronavirus vaccination by 31 Julyâas long as the supply matches our ambitionâ, Health Minister Vaughan Gething has said. A revised vaccine strategy to be published later this week will set out how the Welsh Government will âgrow and adapt the places where vaccines are being administeredâ as it moves into the next phases of the vaccine programme. âOur strategy update will also talk about how we will maintain high-levels of uptake and increase our engagement with people who may be difficult to reach or reluctant to have the vaccine,â Mr Gething added. Workplace and community testing is being expanded alongside faster vaccine delivery in Wales. Health Minister Vaughan Gething said more than 250,000 workers across Wales would have  access to weekly testing using kits which produce results in under half an hour. He said the new Workplace Testing Framework would extend ârapid and regularâ testing to public and private organisations with more than 50 employees. âThe priority will be workplaces that have a higher exposure to risk, involve people working in close proximity to others, and those that deliver key services for the people of Wales,â Mr Gething explained. The minister said from next week âtargeted community testingâ would begin in parts of Bridgend, Merthyr Tydfil and Rhondda Cynon Taf. âBy expanding testing to detect more cases more quickly, particularly those that are asymptomatic, we may well see an uptick in the figures for the prevalence of the virus in Wales,"" he said. âAn increase in the reported number of positive test results is not, in itself, necessarily a bad thing - if the basis for that increase is understood and swift action taken to stop transmission."" Mr Gething said vaccinations and testing were key to guiding Wales out of lockdown âcarefully and safelyâ. Cases of coronavirus in Wales are now at their lowest level since the end of September, according to Health Minister Vaughan Gething. He told the coronavirus briefing there were âaroundâ 76 cases per 100,000 people. Cases are falling in most parts of Wales and the R transmission rate number is between 0.6 and 0.9, Mr Gething added. On the vaccination programme, he said the very latest figures showed more than 878,000 people had received their first dose of the vaccine. ""That's nearly 28% of our whole population and more than a third of the adult population here in Wales,"" he said. The Welsh Government is closely monitoring the impact of the phased return to school, Health Minister Vaughan Gething says. Speaking at the Welsh Government's coronavirus briefing, Mr Gething said it was âan absolute pleasureâ  to see foundation phase children going back to school this week. âThe joy on their faces, and on the faces of their teachers, reminds us of the incredibly important role education plays, not just for learning, but for vital social interaction. âI want to thank all our teachers, unions, local authorities and others for the huge efforts they have made in bringing children back into the classroom this week. âWe will be monitoring this closely and, as the first minister said last week, we want to get as many of our learners back into school as quickly as we can â but as safely as we can."" Flintshire has the highest seven-day Covid case rate of any local authority in Wales, with 103.1 people per 100,000 of the population testing positive for the virus in the past seven days. That is followed by Anglesey with a case rate of 102.8 and Cardiff with 102.5. Ceredigion has the lowest rate with 27.5 cases per 100,000 people. Health Minister Vaughan Gething is about to give a Welsh Government update on the pandemic. We'll give you the main points here - you can also watch the proceedings on BBC One Wales,via the BBC iPlayer, onS4Cand via the Coronavirus Daily Update video link above. Ione WellsWestminster Correspondent, BBC Wales The UK government's Welsh secretary says sending all pupils back to school in England on 8 March is ""definitely in line"" with scientific advice from England's chief medical officer. Simon Hart said while all decisions on lifting lockdown were ""ultimately ministerial decisions"", the approach in England was ""very consistent"" with medical advice. It comes after Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford insisted that reopening schools to all pupils at the same time would be unsafe. Children aged under seven in Wales have begun to return to class this week, with 15 March the target date for all primary school pupils. However,some secondary school pupils may not be back until after Easter, in mid-April. Mr Hart said policy differences were a ""political decision"" and it was for Mr Drakeford to explain why he has taken a different decision. A further 13 people have died with coronavirus in Wales, latest figures from Public Health Wales (PHW) show. It takes the total number of Covid-related deaths reported by PHW in the country to 5,263. A further 236 cases have been reported, bringing the total to 202,560. Vaccinations have been given to 878,506 people with 59,279 having had both their doses. This represents 27.9% and 1.9% of the population of Wales respectively. Â© 2025 BBC.

We'll be back here again next Wednesday for PMQs - and we'll bring you full coverage and analysis of thechancellor's Budget statement. Thanks for following along with us today.  Reality Check At Prime Ministerâs Questions, Labour leader Kier Starmer said: âaround three in ten people who should be self-isolating arenât doing so.â On Monday, he repeated this claim but said the opposite â that only three in ten peoplewereself-isolating fully. This latter claim is supported by data released by the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), which advises the government on the pandemic. It said that just 29% of people who had symptoms ofcoronavirus were full adhering to self-isolation rules.,externalIt described this as âsub optimalâ. Itâs difficult to get a precise figure on the amount of people who do self-isolate because they are generally based on surveys. However, most of these surveys suggest the majority of people do not adhere to the full ten-day isolation period. The government has said that Â£500 payments are available to support those who might face financial difficulties whilst self-isolating.

Reality Check Speaking about the UK vaccination programme at Prime Ministerâs Questions, Boris Johnson made this claim about the Labour leader, Keir Starmer: âOne week he calls for us to go faster with rolling out vaccines when he would have stayed in the European Medicines Agency [EMA], which would have made that rollout impossibleâ. Weâve covered this argument beforeand itâs a claim the Prime Minister hasmade repeatedly. Itâs clear that the UK has done a better job than countries in the EU in approving and distributing vaccines quickly. But the head of the UKâs own medicines regulator, the MHRA, has said the UKâs early approval was permitted under EU law. If the UK had stayed part of the EMA (the EUâs medicines regulator), there would have been political pressure to go with the majority on both the approval and distribution of vaccines. But that was equally true in the past about other big issues, such as joining the euro, or the passport-free Schengen area. And the UK joined neither. Staying in the EMA might have made it harder for the UK to act alone, but it wouldnât have made it impossible. Conservative MP Christian Wakeford has the final question and asks about the government's 'levelling up' agenda. He welcomes the building of a new high school in his Bury South constituency but asks what more can be done to help town centres struggling as a result of Covid-19. The PM says the government is investing in his area through the local growth fund, the building fund and support for the transport network. Everyone will hear more next week he says when thechancellor delivers his Budgetabout how the government will ""build back better"". The SNP's Stuart C MacDonald calls on the prime minister to make permanent a Â£20 weekly increase touniversal creditpayments, currently due to end at the end of March. He says extending the top-up, introduced last year as a temporary response to Covid-19, would bring ""basic dignity"" and avoid benefits dropping to their ""lowest real-terms level in thirty years"". Boris Johnson replies that the government will ""continue to look after people throughout this pandemic and beyond"". He says the best way to do this is to ""bounce our economy back"" as quickly as possible so that people have access to ""high-quality jobs"". The Labour MP for West Lancashire Rosie Cooper, says everyone is looking forward to kids returning to school but in her constituency, students have had to ""wade through overflowing drains"" to get to the classroom. She asks if the PM will make sure no child in her constituency loses out due to problems with flooding in the area. Mr Johnson says he sympathises and knows that flooding has caused disruption. He says the Environment Agency is ""actively"" working with the council to see what more can be done. Labour's Wes Streeting says the education and wellbeing recovery of children is ""one of the biggest challenges"" from the pandemic. He asks if a raise of funding of 43p per student is enough to help with the problems faced by young people. Mr Johnson says that before the pandemic, funding was being increased to state schools and the government was doing ""massive investments"" in education. He says there is a cumulative extra Â£2bn in spending from the UK government on paying teachers more and money for schools. The Labour MP, Neil Hudson raises the issue of poor broadband in rural areas. He says he welcomes the various schemes to improve the service that the government has backed but what reassurance can the PM give people who are still struggling with connectivity in rural Cumbria? Mr Johnson says ministers are doing all they can. He says there is a Â£5bn scheme to connect rural areas and it is hoped that all issues will be sorted within the next five years. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey calls for Team GB to boycott next year's Winter Olympics in Beijing over the treatment of Uighur Muslims in China's Xinjiang region. He calls this a ""genocide happening in front of our eyes"". The prime minister says the UK is ""leading international action"" at the UN to hold China to account for its ""appalling campaign"" against the Uighurs. But he says it is the ""longstanding position"" of his government that they are ""not normally in favour of sporting boycotts"". The SNP's Westminster Leader Ian Blackford says next week's Budget is an opportunity to tackle the financial costs of the pandemic, the UK has suffered its worst recession in 300 years, he warns. He says the Conservatives ""are threatening spending cuts"" which will hurt working families. He asks for a ruling out of austerity and for a major stimulus spending package in next week's budget. Mr Johnson says he is ""proud"" of the government's spending throughout the pandemic. He says the Scottish government are not focusing on spending this money in the right areas. He says this is because the SNP are spending their time chasing a second referendum. Mr Blackford says that Covid-19 has ""exposed the deep inequalities"" in the UK, governed from Westminster. He says President Biden is investing a large package to help the country recover. Mr Johnson says the UK is investing Â£640bn alone in infrastructure across the UK. He says all the SNP want to do is ""break up Britain"" with another referendum. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent The prime minister came up with a new alliterative attack line on the Labour leader: ""he vacillates, we vaccinate.' He will be hoping the vaccination programme will inoculate him from criticism of his earlier handling of the pandemic. He also seemed to hint that there could be more money to help people self isolate in next weekâs Budget. He was pushed by Sir Keir Starmer to give a Â£500 payment to all who needed it. The Labour leader was keen to portray himself as the friend of business and of families, opposing corporate and council tax rises at this stage. His attempt, though, to get the prime minister to denounce some of his own MPs for their avowed lockdown scepticism didnât quite come off. And there is a danger that if Sir Keir sounds more supportive of the PMâs plan than some Conservative MPs, then this could further antagonise those in Labourâs ranks who want to see clearer blue (or red ) water between government and opposition.  Keir Starmer says Â£15bn has been taken out of council budgets over the last 10 years so will the PM stop blaming others? He says this is ""another PMQS with no answers"" but the Budget is an opportunity to choose a different path. Boris Johnson replies that his government wants to do far more than Labour's ""paltry"" agenda. He says he is mystified at how the Labour leader ""weaves hither and yon"" with his opinions. ""He vascillates, we vaccinate"" says Mr Johnson.  Sir Keir says councils are being forced to decide now if they should put up council tax to provide local services. He says councils are all ""in the same position"" of needing to ask for higher tax rates, no matter what their political makeup is, because of a decade of underfunding local services. Mr Johnson says the top ten highest taxing councils in the UK are all run by the Labour Party, and all apart from one are putting up their taxes this year. He says the London Mayor wants to increase taxes by a further 10%, but when he was Mayor of London he reduced his taxes by 20%. Sir Keir Starmer says you can get a Â£1m contract if you have the health secretaryâs WhatsApp but if you need to self-isolate, the government will not help.  The Labour leader asks for assurances families taxes will not go up. Mr Johnson says Labour would put up taxes Sir Keir Starmer says three out of 10 people who should be self-isolating aren't doing so. He says the chair of NHS test and trace has warned that people can't afford to self-isolate, so therefore people are not taking tests. He says lower-income areas are seeing ""stubbornly high"" infection rates. Mr Johnson says there has been a Â£280bn package of support for people since the start of the pandemic, and people on the lowest incomes have been on the highest levels of support. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says the principles behind a cautious recovery plan are ""plainly right"". He warns that there are people falling victim to disinformation and saying Covid-19 is not as dangerous as feared. Boris Johnson says the roadmap set out by government on the recovery is supported by the data, and available for MPs to read. The first question comes from Labour's Derek Twigg who says councils are running out of funding because the help offered by government is not enough. He says a properly funded scheme is needed so people can self-isolate if they test positive for Covid-19. Mr Johnson says it is ""very tough"" for councils but the government has given an extra Â£4.3bn. He says ministers will continue to support councils and the chancellor will say more in his Budget statement next week. Â© 2025 BBC.

Reality Check At Prime Ministerâs Questions, Labour leader Kier Starmer said: âaround three in ten people who should be self-isolating arenât doing so.â On Monday, he repeated this claim but said the opposite â that only three in ten peoplewereself-isolating fully. This latter claim is supported by data released by the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), which advises the government on the pandemic. It said that just 29% of people who had symptoms ofcoronavirus were full adhering to self-isolation rules.,externalIt described this as âsub optimalâ. Itâs difficult to get a precise figure on the amount of people who do self-isolate because they are generally based on surveys. However, most of these surveys suggest the majority of people do not adhere to the full ten-day isolation period. The government has said that Â£500 payments are available to support those who might face financial difficulties whilst self-isolating. Again, there is no publicly-available data on this, but freedom of information requests to local councils have shown that the majority of people who apply are rejected due to the tough eligibility criteria.

"The US has pledged to donate 500 million more doses of the Pfizer vaccine to poorer nations from next year - bringing its total commitment to more than one billion. ""To beat the pandemic here, we need to beat it everywhere,"" US President Joe Biden told a virtual Covid-19 summit. The donation will be routed through Covax - the international scheme designed to ensure low-income countries aren't left behind in the fight against Covid. It came amid growing warnings over the pace of global vaccinations, and inequity of access. Covax,externalwas created last year to ensure that Covid vaccines are made available around the world, with richer countries subsidising costs for poorer nations. The scheme hopes to distribute enough vaccines to protect at least 20% of the population in 92 low- or medium-income countries - starting with healthcare workers and the most vulnerable groups. Its initial goal was to provide two billion doses of vaccines worldwide in 2021, and 1.8 billion doses to 92 poorer countries by early 2022. Covax is run by a number of international organisations, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the UN children's charity, Unicef. Ghana was the first country to receive Covax vaccines in February. Since then, more than 303 million doses have been shipped through Covax to 142 countries around the world, including Bangladesh, Brazil, Ethiopia and Fiji. Most doses are going to poorer countries, but some have been sent to wealthier countries such as Canada,which defended its request. Covid vaccines: How fast is worldwide progress? Covid map: Where are cases the highest? Covax works with with governments and vaccine manufacturers around the world. Supporters include the US, the UK, Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, the UAE, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden, and Portugal. Countries have pledged to donate both money and surplus doses from their own vaccine supplies. The US joined Covax after President Biden took office in January 2021 The UK, Japan, Canada and the European Union are among those to have committed to supplying tens of millions of doses. WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus previously criticised wealthier nations for ""gobbling up"" the global vaccine supply. G7 countries have purchased over a third of the world's vaccine supply, despite making up only 13% of the global population. Six vaccines have been given ""emergency use authorisation"" by the WHO, meaning they can be shared via Covax: AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Janssen, Moderna, Sinopharm and Sinovac. However, only Pfizer and AstraZeneca doses have been delivered so far. Moderna has agreed to supply 500 million doses at its ""lowest-tiered price"", but most won't be available until 2022. Covax has been criticised for being slow. Some initial targets were missed, partly as a result of the poor health infrastructure in many of the recipient countries, and partly because of vaccine hesitancy. Covax supplied AstraZeneca Covid vaccines arriving in Madagascar in May 2021 Deliveries were also delayed because of the deteriorating situation in India. Officials thererestricted exports to protect their own populationamid soaring infection rates. Theseare set to resume from October. Covax has told the BBC that too many donations have come in small quantities, at the last minute and with little time left before they expire. This makes it very hard to get them to where they are needed. Representatives of the scheme also note that only a small percentage of the pledges made earlier this year have turned into actual doses. Unicef executive director Henrietta Fore said countries needed to ""accelerate their donation plans"", with low-income nations unable to wait any longer. While many high-income countries have now given at least one shot to more than half their populations, only 2% of people in low-income countries have had their first dose, according to data from the University of Oxford. Covax says it is now expecting to hit its ""key milestone"" of releasing two billion doses for delivery some time early next year. Why are vaccines being destroyed in Africa? Will countries be left behind in the vaccine race? In total, some six billion doses of coronavirus vaccines have been administered, in over 195 countries worldwide. However, while some countries have fully vaccinated a large amount of their population, many others have only just begun, or in some cases are still waiting for their first doses to arrive. Covax aims to close that gap. ""With a fast-moving pandemic, no one is safe, unless everyone is safe,"" the WHO says on its website. But even if Covax meets its goal to vaccinate 20% of the population in its 92 target countries, that's well short of the level of immunity that experts say is needed to end the pandemic. The WHO has suggested that figure is at least 70%. People may also need booster doses to remain protected.

Reality Check Speaking about the UK vaccination programme at Prime Ministerâs Questions, Boris Johnson made this claim about the Labour leader, Keir Starmer: âOne week he calls for us to go faster with rolling out vaccines when he would have stayed in the European Medicines Agency [EMA], which would have made that rollout impossibleâ. Weâve covered this argument beforeand itâs a claim the Prime Minister hasmade repeatedly. Itâs clear that the UK has done a better job than countries in the EU in approving and distributing vaccines quickly. But the head of the UKâs own medicines regulator, the MHRA, has said the UKâs early approval was permitted under EU law. If the UK had stayed part of the EMA (the EUâs medicines regulator), there would have been political pressure to go with the majority on both the approval and distribution of vaccines. But that was equally true in the past about other big issues, such as joining the euro, or the passport-free Schengen area. And the UK joined neither. Staying in the EMA might have made it harder for the UK to act alone, but it wouldnât have made it impossible. Conservative MP Christian Wakeford has the final question and asks about the government's 'levelling up' agenda. He welcomes the building of a new high school in his Bury South constituency but asks what more can be done to help town centres struggling as a result of Covid-19.

The Labour MP for West Lancashire Rosie Cooper, says everyone is looking forward to kids returning to school but in her constituency, students have had to ""wade through overflowing drains"" to get to the classroom.

Labour's Wes Streeting says the education and wellbeing recovery of children is ""one of the biggest challenges"" from the pandemic. He asks if a raise of funding of 43p per student is enough to help with the problems faced by young people. Mr Johnson says that before the pandemic, funding was being increased to state schools and the government was doing ""massive investments"" in education. He says there is a cumulative extra Â£2bn in spending from the UK government on paying teachers more and money for schools. The Labour MP, Neil Hudson raises the issue of poor broadband in rural areas. He says he welcomes the various schemes to improve the service that the government has backed but what reassurance can the PM give people who are still struggling with connectivity in rural Cumbria?

Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey calls for Team GB to boycott next year's Winter Olympics in Beijing over the treatment of Uighur Muslims in China's Xinjiang region. He calls this a ""genocide happening in front of our eyes"". The prime minister says the UK is ""leading international action"" at the UN to hold China to account for its ""appalling campaign"" against the Uighurs. But he says it is the ""longstanding position"" of his government that they are ""not normally in favour of sporting boycotts"". The SNP's Westminster Leader Ian Blackford says next week's Budget is an opportunity to tackle the financial costs of the pandemic, the UK has suffered its worst recession in 300 years, he warns. He says the Conservatives ""are threatening spending cuts"" which will hurt working families. He asks for a ruling out of austerity and for a major stimulus spending package in next week's budget. Mr Johnson says he is ""proud"" of the government's spending throughout the pandemic. He says the Scottish government are not focusing on spending this money in the right areas. He says this is because the SNP are spending their time chasing a second referendum. Mr Blackford says that Covid-19 has ""exposed the deep inequalities"" in the UK, governed from Westminster. He says President Biden is investing a large package to help the country recover. Mr Johnson says the UK is investing Â£640bn alone in infrastructure across the UK. He says all the SNP want to do is ""break up Britain"" with another referendum. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent The prime minister came up with a new alliterative attack line on the Labour leader: ""he vacillates, we vaccinate.' He will be hoping the vaccination programme will inoculate him from criticism of his earlier handling of the pandemic. He also seemed to hint that there could be more money to help people self isolate in next weekâs Budget. He was pushed by Sir Keir Starmer to give a Â£500 payment to all who needed it. The Labour leader was keen to portray himself as the friend of business and of families, opposing corporate and council tax rises at this stage. His attempt, though, to get the prime minister to denounce some of his own MPs for their avowed lockdown scepticism didnât quite come off. And there is a danger that if Sir Keir sounds more supportive of the PMâs plan than some Conservative MPs, then this could further antagonise those in Labourâs ranks who want to see clearer blue (or red ) water between government and opposition.  Keir Starmer says Â£15bn has been taken out of council budgets over the last 10 years so will the PM stop blaming others? He says this is ""another PMQS with no answers"" but the Budget is an opportunity to choose a different path. Boris Johnson replies that his government wants to do far more than Labour's ""paltry"" agenda. He says he is mystified at how the Labour leader ""weaves hither and yon"" with his opinions. ""He vascillates, we vaccinate"" says Mr Johnson.  Sir Keir says councils are being forced to decide now if they should put up council tax to provide local services. He says councils are all ""in the same position"" of needing to ask for higher tax rates, no matter what their political makeup is, because of a decade of underfunding local services. Mr Johnson says the top ten highest taxing councils in the UK are all run by the Labour Party, and all apart from one are putting up their taxes this year. He says the London Mayor wants to increase taxes by a further 10%, but when he was Mayor of London he reduced his taxes by 20%. Sir Keir Starmer says you can get a Â£1m contract if you have the health secretaryâs WhatsApp but if you need to self-isolate, the government will not help.  The Labour leader asks for assurances families taxes will not go up. Mr Johnson says Labour would put up taxes Sir Keir Starmer says three out of 10 people who should be self-isolating aren't doing so. He says the chair of NHS test and trace has warned that people can't afford to self-isolate, so therefore people are not taking tests. He says lower-income areas are seeing ""stubbornly high"" infection rates. Mr Johnson says there has been a Â£280bn package of support for people since the start of the pandemic, and people on the lowest incomes have been on the highest levels of support. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says the principles behind a cautious recovery plan are ""plainly right"". He warns that there are people falling victim to disinformation and saying Covid-19 is not as dangerous as feared. Boris Johnson says the roadmap set out by government on the recovery is supported by the data, and available for MPs to read. The first question comes from Labour's Derek Twigg who says councils are running out of funding because the help offered by government is not enough. He says a properly funded scheme is needed so people can self-isolate if they test positive for Covid-19. Mr Johnson says it is ""very tough"" for councils but the government has given an extra Â£4.3bn. He says ministers will continue to support councils and the chancellor will say more in his Budget statement next week. Â© 2025 BBC.

We'll be back here again next Wednesday for PMQs - and we'll bring you full coverage and analysis of thechancellor's Budget statement. Thanks for following along with us today.  Reality Check At Prime Ministerâs Questions, Labour leader Kier Starmer said: âaround three in ten people who should be self-isolating arenât doing so.â On Monday, he repeated this claim but said the opposite â that only three in ten peoplewereself-isolating fully. This latter claim is supported by data released by the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), which advises the government on the pandemic. It said that just 29% of people who had symptoms ofcoronavirus were full adhering to self-isolation rules.,externalIt described this as âsub optimalâ. Itâs difficult to get a precise figure on the amount of people who do self-isolate because they are generally based on surveys. However, most of these surveys suggest the majority of people do not adhere to the full ten-day isolation period. The government has said that Â£500 payments are available to support those who might face financial difficulties whilst self-isolating. Again, there is no publicly-available data on this, but freedom of information requests to local councils have shown that the majority of people who apply are rejected due to the tough eligibility criteria.

Reality Check Speaking about the UK vaccination programme at Prime Ministerâs Questions, Boris Johnson made this claim about the Labour leader, Keir Starmer: âOne week he calls for us to go faster with rolling out vaccines when he would have stayed in the European Medicines Agency [EMA], which would have made that rollout impossibleâ. Weâve covered this argument beforeand itâs a claim the Prime Minister hasmade repeatedly. Itâs clear that the UK has done a better job than countries in the EU in approving and distributing vaccines quickly. But the head of the UKâs own medicines regulator, the MHRA, has said the UKâs early approval was permitted under EU law. If the UK had stayed part of the EMA (the EUâs medicines regulator), there would have been political pressure to go with the majority on both the approval and distribution of vaccines. But that was equally true in the past about other big issues, such as joining the euro, or the passport-free Schengen area. And the UK joined neither. Staying in the EMA might have made it harder for the UK to act alone, but it wouldnât have made it impossible. Conservative MP Christian Wakeford has the final question and asks about the government's 'levelling up' agenda. He welcomes the building of a new high school in his Bury South constituency but asks what more can be done to help town centres struggling as a result of Covid-19. The PM says the government is investing in his area through the local growth fund, the building fund and support for the transport network.

"Heathrow Airport has reported a Â£2bn annual loss after passenger numbers during the coronavirus pandemic dropped to levels last seen in the 1970s. It said 2020 was the toughest year in its 75-year history and the loss ""underlines the devastating impact of Covid-19 on aviation"". Heathrow's results contained a warning it may not be able to carry on if passenger numbers remain low. However, its boss said the airport had enough money to cope until 2023. John Holland-Kaye also told the BBC that he thought people would be likely to be able to go on their summer holidays. Under the UK government's roadmap out of lockdown, which was published on Monday, international travel might be able to resume in mid-May. ""For the aviation sector, we can start to plan ahead for 17 May to make sure we've got the people and the planes in place so that we can get, not just people on their holidays, but also start to get British businesses moving again,"" he said. Mr Holland-Kaye said it was likely that travel to the UK from ""low-risk"" countries such as New Zealand and Singapore would not require a Covid test, ""medium-risk"" countries where passengers would need a test, and ""high risk"" countries would require tougher passenger controls such as quarantining. The UK is in discussions with G7 countries and others as to how to allow greater foreign travel, withtalks underway with some countries about a potential passport scheme. Mr Holland-Kaye said that a digital vaccine passport and international agreements would be needed to speed up travel at airports. Currently it takes about 20 minutes per passenger at Heathrow to sort out the necessary paperwork, which will not be feasible when passenger numbers pick up, he said.

EmailHaveYourSay@bbc.co.uk,external WhatsApp:+44 7756 165803,external Tweet:@BBC_HaveYourSay,external Please read ourterms & conditionsandprivacy policy Lockdowns and travel restrictions imposed in 2020 to try to limit the global spread of coronavirus hit the aviation sector hard. Heathrow normally has about 80 million passengers per year, but it said numbers in 2020 dropped to 22 million, with more than half of those travelling in January and February before the coronavirus crisis took hold. In the long-term, if passenger numbers were to drop below 27 million, Heathrow would be in danger of breaching deals it has with creditors, it said. In January, the governmentopened a financial support scheme for airports in England, which included Â£8m per applicant to be used to cover fixed costs such as business rates. On Wednesday, Heathrow called on Chancellor Rishi Sunak to use next week's Budget to extend the furlough scheme and give a 100% business rates holiday to give additional support to the aviation sector. Heathrow doesn't have many passengers at the moment, but one thing it does have a lot of is borrowing. The London airport has built a Â£15bn debt pile in the past decade while paying its shareholders several billion pounds in dividends. The collapse in traffic caused by the coronavirus pandemic has understandably put a strain on its finances, to the extent that the company has asked the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), its economic regulator, for an increase in prices to compensate. The request has outraged its airline customers, who say they and their passengers should not have to pick up the airport's pandemic tab. There is no danger of Heathrow running out of money in the short term - it has about Â£4bn in cash, enough to keep it ticking over for two years - but the accounts do include a warning about the future. The directors say that the uncertainty about the timescale and nature of the recovery from the pandemic ""indicates the existence of a material uncertainty which could cast significant doubt upon the group and the company's ability to continue as a going concern"". It would take a serious prolongation of traffic restrictions for Heathrow's current financial structure to crack - but the warning underlines why the company is pressing the CAA so hard for a price increase. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has also pleaded with governments to continue their financial support for the aviation sector. The industry body warned on Wednesday that airlines could continue to burn cash into 2022 amid uncertainty around when restrictions will ease. It estimated that aviation firms burnt through $77bn (Â£54.6bn) in cash during the second half of 2020 alone. Its boss Alexandre de Juniac told the BBC: ""The crisis is not over. ""If you want us to be alive when the restart will come, when the traffic will recover, which is not before the second half of 2021... We need support with additional financial help."" It is currently working on a ""Covid travel pass"", an app which could be used to verify if a passenger has had the Covid-19 tests or vaccines required to enter a country. The director general said in a BBC interview on Wednesday that it is talking to the UK government about using its app. He played down concerns about the security of any app-based system: ""It's pretty well done and designed for that purpose"". Mr de Juniac said the focus was on passengers controlling their data and that ""there is no information that is stored in any database that the government control or IATA control at all.""

""He vascillates, we vaccinate"" says Mr Johnson.  Sir Keir says councils are being forced to decide now if they should put up council tax to provide local services. He says councils are all ""in the same position"" of needing to ask for higher tax rates, no matter what their political makeup is, because of a decade of underfunding local services. Mr Johnson says the top ten highest taxing councils in the UK are all run by the Labour Party, and all apart from one are putting up their taxes this year. He says the London Mayor wants to increase taxes by a further 10%, but when he was Mayor of London he reduced his taxes by 20%. Sir Keir Starmer says you can get a Â£1m contract if you have the health secretaryâs WhatsApp but if you need to self-isolate, the government will not help.  The Labour leader asks for assurances families taxes will not go up. Mr Johnson says Labour would put up taxes Sir Keir Starmer says three out of 10 people who should be self-isolating aren't doing so. He says the chair of NHS test and trace has warned that people can't afford to self-isolate, so therefore people are not taking tests. He says lower-income areas are seeing ""stubbornly high"" infection rates. Mr Johnson says there has been a Â£280bn package of support for people since the start of the pandemic, and people on the lowest incomes have been on the highest levels of support. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says the principles behind a cautious recovery plan are ""plainly right"". He warns that there are people falling victim to disinformation and saying Covid-19 is not as dangerous as feared. Boris Johnson says the roadmap set out by government on the recovery is supported by the data, and available for MPs to read. The first question comes from Labour's Derek Twigg who says councils are running out of funding because the help offered by government is not enough. He says a properly funded scheme is needed so people can self-isolate if they test positive for Covid-19. Mr Johnson says it is ""very tough"" for councils but the government has given an extra Â£4.3bn. He says ministers will continue to support councils and the chancellor will say more in his Budget statement next week. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Health Minister Vaughan Gething has been giving a Welsh Government update on the pandemic He says all adults in Wales will have been offered a first Covid jab by 31 July subject to supplies matching targets Another 13 people have died with Covid in Wales, taking the official total to 5,263, according to Public Health Wales A woman whose husband died nearly a year after they were last able to hold hands says the ban on indoor care home visits is 'a form of cruelty' A solicitor says she is being inundated with calls from firms asking if they can refuse to employ someone who has declined a Covid jab Nicola Bryan and Andy Roberts That's it for our live coverage of the Welsh Government's update on the pandemic. Here's a recap on the main developments so far today:  You can follow coverage of this afternoon's proceedings in the Welsh Parliament via ourSenedd Liveblog. Have a good afternoon, and stay safe. Daniel DaviesBBC Wales political correspondent Education Minister Kirsty Williams says sending all children back to school at once would pile pressure on the NHS. Under current plans, the final group of secondary school pupils will not be back in schooluntil the summer term starts on 12 April, although the youngest primary school children have begun to return this week. In England, all age groups are due to return on March 8. However, during a visit to a primary school in Cardiff, Ms Williams insisted the Welsh Government was following scientific advice. âWe've been advised if you bring all children back in one big bang that potentially has a massive effect on the R number [infection rate],"" she said. âWe will see [Covid case] rates begin to climb again and we will see extra pressure being put back on our NHS. âNobody wants to go there. That's why we are doing it carefully and cautiously.â Ms Williams added she would âwelcome a discussionâ on changing the academic year in the wake of the pandemic. Shorter summer holidays and longer breaks in the autumn and Christmas âactually might be a more appropriate way to organise the school yearâ, she said. Kirsty Williams: ""We are doing it carefully and cautiously"" Of the latest 13 deaths withm Covid in Wales, six were reported by Betsi Cadwaladr health board, which provides NHS services in north Wales. There were two deaths reported by Cwm Taf Morgannwg in south Wales, and two by Hywel Dda which serves west Wales. One death was reported by the boards for Swansea Bay, Cardiff and Vale, and Aneurin Bevan, which covers south east Wales. The news that all adults in Wales will be offered the coronavirus vaccine by the end of July is a ""huge game-changer,"" Welsh Conservative Janet Finch-Saunders says. The member of the Senedd (MS) for Aberconwy said as more people were vaccinated ""so too will those expectations grow"". Ms Finch-Saunders said it was ""very disappointing"" that Health Minister Vaughan Gething had been ""vague"" in the news conference about visits to care homes. ""People have really suffered as a result of not seeing their loved ones who are very vulnerable in those care homes,"" she told BBC Wales. ""England have already made the announcements about visits being allowed in March."" Plaid Cymru has welcomed the health minister's announcement that there will be guidance issued on prioritising vaccinations in Wales for people with learning disabilities, severe mental illness and unpaid carers. Member of the Senedd (MS) Delyth Jewell said it could ""make a huge difference"", adding: ""This is a really exciting day for all the campaigners who have been fighting so hard for this change in policy."" She told BBC Wales: ""If we look at the number of care home residents with learning disabilities - we're talking about maybe 3,500 people - that would be around 10% of the vaccinations given any day in Wales."" Ms Jewell said she had been campaigning for this for ""a number of weeks"" but questioned ""why the certainty couldn't have been given to families two weeks ago"". Attempting to give long-term forecasts about emerging out of the pandemic has ""made a mug of a range of people,"" Health Minister Vaughan Gething says. He said ""forecasting much further into the future"" was ""fraught with difficulty and uncertainty"" which was ""getting into something that is more like astrology than science and public health advice"". ""Whether itâs âcoronavirus sent packing in 12 weeksâ, âa vaccine by Septemberâ or âreturn to normality by Decemberâ, all of those things have proven to be long-term punts that havenât fared well with reality,"" Mr Gething said. âWeâre doing something that is forecasting a reasonable amount into the future, with a three-week review. ""Weâll be up front about what that means, what the next review might mean as well, to give people enough time to get used to the practical progress weâre making."" The UK governmentâs decision to reopen schools to all children in England at the same time is not in line with medical and scientific advice, Health Minister Vaughan Gething says. He said it was in contrast with the Welsh Governmentâs policy of a phased school reopening. âThe advice from the chief medical officers and scientific evidence advice isnât really any different within the UK,â he said. âWhat England have chosen to do though is theyâve chosen to move away from the advice of having a more phased approach to school reopening, but to have a âbig bangâ reopening on 8 March. âThe consequence of that is theyâre having to have a bigger gap between that intervention and when theyâre next contemplating doing something else."" Health Minister Vaughan Gething said he was expecting more guidance to be issued by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) in the next few days about the prioritisation of jabs for under-50s. âWe have asked questions as indeed have other governments in the UK about whether there should prioritisation within that,"" he said. On the latest advice from the JCVI that people registered with learning disabilities should be prioritised in group six for jabs, Mr Gething said he would follow guidance suggesting the use of GP registers to identify people. He said he would be working with GP practises to make sure âthe GP registers actually cover all the people  weâd want to see coveredâ. The pandemic has seen a ""huge leap forward"" in the way services for people's mental and physical health are provided in Wales, according to the health minister. Vaughan Gething said the ""necessity of doing that"" in the current circumstances meant ""we're going to have a better way to deliver a range of our services into the future"". He said before the pandemic the Welsh Government had ""invested lots"" in ""tier zero services"" - the ""lowest level of intervention"" that ""make a really big difference to help support, sustain and improve people's wellbeing"". This approach was to avoid these people going on to need services for more serious mental ill-health, Mr Gething said. The minister said other measures had included a scheme addressing the impact of mental health concerns  for children and young people. It was ""undeniable that we've seen real improvements in mental health provision over the course of this [Senedd] term"", he added. The Welsh Governmentâs upcoming budget will take account of extra strains put on peopleâs mental health because of the pandemic, according to the health minister. Vaughan Gething said considerably more money was already being put in to support mental health services in Wales, and pledged that this would continue into the next financial year. âAs weâre putting more money into those services in a variety of different ways, the money weâre planning to put into the budget in the next year will need to account for the increase in the mental health needs that weâve already seen and will continue to see,â he said. âThereâs a range of different strands and [the Minister for Mental Health] Eluned Morgan will be providing more information before we get to the end of March about what we expect to do with the money in our budget. âWeâll also then be able to take account of any further announcements made in the UK budget announced on 3 March,â he added. The Welsh Government is publishing guidance that will âhelp support vaccine uptake for unpaid carers and people with learning disabilities or severe mental illnessâ, Health Minister Vaughan Gething says. He said it would âtake into accountâ the latest advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI). Mr Gething said the guidance would explain who in these groups is eligible for vaccine prioritisation and explain how to identify, contact and support people to access their vaccine. âUnpaid carers and those with learning disabilities and severe mental illness is a large group, and it may take some time for NHS Wales to offer appointments to everyone,â he said. âBut please be assured that our NHS is working as quickly as possible and nobody will be left behind."" Priority groups five to nine are now being vaccinated against coronavirus, according to Health Minister Vaughan Gething. He said: âThat is everyone aged 50 to 69, everyone aged over 16 with an underlying health condition that puts them at increased risk of serious illness with coronavirus, and many of our invaluable unpaid carers who provide care for someone who is clinically vulnerable to the virus."" Mr Gething added: âSubject to vaccine supply, we will have reached all these people by the middle of April.â All eligible adults in Wales will be offereda first coronavirus vaccination by 31 Julyâas long as the supply matches our ambitionâ, Health Minister Vaughan Gething has said. A revised vaccine strategy to be published later this week will set out how the Welsh Government will âgrow and adapt the places where vaccines are being administeredâ as it moves into the next phases of the vaccine programme. âOur strategy update will also talk about how we will maintain high-levels of uptake and increase our engagement with people who may be difficult to reach or reluctant to have the vaccine,â Mr Gething added. Workplace and community testing is being expanded alongside faster vaccine delivery in Wales. Health Minister Vaughan Gething said more than 250,000 workers across Wales would have  access to weekly testing using kits which produce results in under half an hour. He said the new Workplace Testing Framework would extend ârapid and regularâ testing to public and private organisations with more than 50 employees. âThe priority will be workplaces that have a higher exposure to risk, involve people working in close proximity to others, and those that deliver key services for the people of Wales,â Mr Gething explained. The minister said from next week âtargeted community testingâ would begin in parts of Bridgend, Merthyr Tydfil and Rhondda Cynon Taf. âBy expanding testing to detect more cases more quickly, particularly those that are asymptomatic, we may well see an uptick in the figures for the prevalence of the virus in Wales,"" he said. âAn increase in the reported number of positive test results is not, in itself, necessarily a bad thing - if the basis for that increase is understood and swift action taken to stop transmission."" Mr Gething said vaccinations and testing were key to guiding Wales out of lockdown âcarefully and safelyâ. Cases of coronavirus in Wales are now at their lowest level since the end of September, according to Health Minister Vaughan Gething. He told the coronavirus briefing there were âaroundâ 76 cases per 100,000 people. Cases are falling in most parts of Wales and the R transmission rate number is between 0.6 and 0.9, Mr Gething added. On the vaccination programme, he said the very latest figures showed more than 878,000 people had received their first dose of the vaccine. ""That's nearly 28% of our whole population and more than a third of the adult population here in Wales,"" he said. The Welsh Government is closely monitoring the impact of the phased return to school, Health Minister Vaughan Gething says. Speaking at the Welsh Government's coronavirus briefing, Mr Gething said it was âan absolute pleasureâ  to see foundation phase children going back to school this week. âThe joy on their faces, and on the faces of their teachers, reminds us of the incredibly important role education plays, not just for learning, but for vital social interaction. âI want to thank all our teachers, unions, local authorities and others for the huge efforts they have made in bringing children back into the classroom this week. âWe will be monitoring this closely and, as the first minister said last week, we want to get as many of our learners back into school as quickly as we can â but as safely as we can."" Flintshire has the highest seven-day Covid case rate of any local authority in Wales, with 103.1 people per 100,000 of the population testing positive for the virus in the past seven days. That is followed by Anglesey with a case rate of 102.8 and Cardiff with 102.5. Ceredigion has the lowest rate with 27.5 cases per 100,000 people. Health Minister Vaughan Gething is about to give a Welsh Government update on the pandemic. We'll give you the main points here - you can also watch the proceedings on BBC One Wales,via the BBC iPlayer, onS4Cand via the Coronavirus Daily Update video link above. Ione WellsWestminster Correspondent, BBC Wales The UK government's Welsh secretary says sending all pupils back to school in England on 8 March is ""definitely in line"" with scientific advice from England's chief medical officer. Simon Hart said while all decisions on lifting lockdown were ""ultimately ministerial decisions"", the approach in England was ""very consistent"" with medical advice. It comes after Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford insisted that reopening schools to all pupils at the same time would be unsafe. Children aged under seven in Wales have begun to return to class this week, with 15 March the target date for all primary school pupils. However,some secondary school pupils may not be back until after Easter, in mid-April. Mr Hart said policy differences were a ""political decision"" and it was for Mr Drakeford to explain why he has taken a different decision. A further 13 people have died with coronavirus in Wales, latest figures from Public Health Wales (PHW) show. It takes the total number of Covid-related deaths reported by PHW in the country to 5,263. A further 236 cases have been reported, bringing the total to 202,560. Vaccinations have been given to 878,506 people with 59,279 having had both their doses. This represents 27.9% and 1.9% of the population of Wales respectively. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played From trophies to torment - how Lennon's second Celtic stint unfolded Celtic manager Neil Lennon has resigned with his side 18 points adrift of Rangers in the Scottish Premiership. Lennon took charge for a second spell in February 2019 when Brendan Rodgers left and led the club to two titles, two Scottish Cups and a League Cup. However, Celtic are well behind their Glasgow rivals in their bid to win 10-straight titles and slumped to defeat at struggling Ross County on Sunday. Assistant manager John Kennedy will take interim charge of the team.

""We have experienced a difficult season due to so many factors and it is very frustrating and disappointing that we have not been able to hit the same heights as we did previously,"" Lennon said. ""I have worked as hard as ever to try and turn things around, but unfortunately we have not managed to get the kind of run going that we have needed. ""I have always given my best to the club and have been proud to deliver silverware to the Celtic supporters. The club will always be part of me. I will always be a Celtic supporter myself and I will always want the best for Celtic."" Celtic chief executive Peter Lawwell:""Neil has always been and will always be a true Celtic man and someone I will always hold in the highest regard. Personally, it is a sad day for me to see Neil leave. Neil is a man of quality and decency, he is someone who will always be part of the fabric of Celtic and someone who will always be welcomed.""

He has given so much to the club, and with his success over the last number of years - including winning a treble in his own right - he will be very difficult to replace."" Celtic captain Scott Brown:""He's supported Celtic his whole life and he wanted to play for this club - he won a treble as a player, as well as a manager. He's given 15-20 years to this club and he deserves respect, and also praise for what he's done for the club and the success he brought us.

The results just haven't been good enough and I feel for Neil because I was there as a player with him and he's given his life to Celtic. But the club had to make a decision to move forward."" Rangers manager Steven Gerrard:""I can't say I'm surprised because of what's been going on over there. But I obviously take no personal satisfaction, so I wish him well for the future."" Former Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers:""When it all settles down, Neil is an incredible legend of the club, he has given so much service to the club, won so many titles and like I say, his legacy there will be intact forever."" Former Rangers manager Ally McCoist:""Hopefully he can get some sanity back in his life and go and enjoy himself and relax with his family for a period.

BBC Scotland's sports news correspondent Chris McLaughlin This is something we've been expected for some time, and it comes as a surprise that it hasn't happened before now, even for the man himself. The defeat at Ross County seems to have been the last straw. The Celtic board have been in talks about this over the past few days. Lennon delivered the unprecedented quadruple treble, but he has had major struggles with the side this season and Rangers are now just seven points away from stopping Celtic making it 10 titles in a row. This video can not be played Watch Lennon's last post-match interview as Celtic manager The majority of the fans have been calling for him to step aside for some time now. It will take time for the dust to settle but I would imagine in the next couple of seasons, Celtic fans will look back with fondness on Neil Lennon as both player and manager. Lennon answered Celtic's call in early 2019, when Rodgers departed mid-season for Leicester City, and guided the club to their eighth league crown in a row while securing a third-straight Scottish Cup. After Celtic beat Hearts in the final, he was offered the job on a permanent basis by Lawwell in the Hampden showers. This video can not be played 'Horrific' defending from Celtic - analysis Last season was called early amid the coronavirus pandemic, with Celtic handsomely ahead of Rangers and crowned champions, having also defeated their rivals in the League Cup showpiece. But this term, as the club pursued an unprecedented 10th league title in succession, things unravelled spectacularly. Celtic were eliminated from the second round of Champions League qualifiers at home by Ferencvaros, and won just one of their six Europa League group games. Although they won nine of their opening 10 league fixtures, they lost the first two Old Firm derbies of the term, and dropped points to Aberdeen, Hibernian, St Johnstone and Livingston. Their incredible run of 35 domestic cup wins was ended by Ross County, who prevailed 2-0 at Celtic Park in the League Cup last 16. That led to fan protests and clashes with police outside the stadium. Lennon oversaw more Scottish Cup success in December, as Celtic won the 2019-20 trophy on penalties despite losing a 2-0 lead against Hearts, ensuring the Northern Irishman became the first man to win a treble as player and manager, and sealed a Scottish-first quadruple treble. But the glory was short-lived. Celtic lost at home to St Mirren in January, and despite holding games in hand, remained well shy of Rangers, who are yet to lose a league match this season. Sunday's 1-0 loss to County, who were bottom of the table heading into the fixture, sealed Lennon's fate, with Rangers on the brink of ending their domestic supremacy.

"Heathrow Airport has reported a Â£2bn annual loss after passenger numbers during the coronavirus pandemic dropped to levels last seen in the 1970s. It said 2020 was the toughest year in its 75-year history and the loss ""underlines the devastating impact of Covid-19 on aviation"". Heathrow's results contained a warning it may not be able to carry on if passenger numbers remain low. However, its boss said the airport had enough money to cope until 2023. John Holland-Kaye also told the BBC that he thought people would be likely to be able to go on their summer holidays. Under the UK government's roadmap out of lockdown, which was published on Monday, international travel might be able to resume in mid-May. ""For the aviation sector, we can start to plan ahead for 17 May to make sure we've got the people and the planes in place so that we can get, not just people on their holidays, but also start to get British businesses moving again,"" he said. Mr Holland-Kaye said it was likely that travel to the UK from ""low-risk"" countries such as New Zealand and Singapore would not require a Covid test, ""medium-risk"" countries where passengers would need a test, and ""high risk"" countries would require tougher passenger controls such as quarantining. The UK is in discussions with G7 countries and others as to how to allow greater foreign travel, withtalks underway with some countries about a potential passport scheme. Mr Holland-Kaye said that a digital vaccine passport and international agreements would be needed to speed up travel at airports. Currently it takes about 20 minutes per passenger at Heathrow to sort out the necessary paperwork, which will not be feasible when passenger numbers pick up, he said. When can I go on holiday in the UK or travel abroad? Airlines' Covid travel pass ready 'within weeks' Have you recently booked a holiday? Get in touch. EmailHaveYourSay@bbc.co.uk,external WhatsApp:+44 7756 165803,external Tweet:@BBC_HaveYourSay,external Please read ourterms & conditionsandprivacy policy Lockdowns and travel restrictions imposed in 2020 to try to limit the global spread of coronavirus hit the aviation sector hard. Heathrow normally has about 80 million passengers per year, but it said numbers in 2020 dropped to 22 million, with more than half of those travelling in January and February before the coronavirus crisis took hold. In the long-term, if passenger numbers were to drop below 27 million, Heathrow would be in danger of breaching deals it has with creditors, it said. In January, the governmentopened a financial support scheme for airports in England, which included Â£8m per applicant to be used to cover fixed costs such as business rates. On Wednesday, Heathrow called on Chancellor Rishi Sunak to use next week's Budget to extend the furlough scheme and give a 100% business rates holiday to give additional support to the aviation sector. Heathrow doesn't have many passengers at the moment, but one thing it does have a lot of is borrowing. The London airport has built a Â£15bn debt pile in the past decade while paying its shareholders several billion pounds in dividends. The collapse in traffic caused by the coronavirus pandemic has understandably put a strain on its finances, to the extent that the company has asked the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), its economic regulator, for an increase in prices to compensate. The request has outraged its airline customers, who say they and their passengers should not have to pick up the airport's pandemic tab. There is no danger of Heathrow running out of money in the short term - it has about Â£4bn in cash, enough to keep it ticking over for two years - but the accounts do include a warning about the future. The directors say that the uncertainty about the timescale and nature of the recovery from the pandemic ""indicates the existence of a material uncertainty which could cast significant doubt upon the group and the company's ability to continue as a going concern"". It would take a serious prolongation of traffic restrictions for Heathrow's current financial structure to crack - but the warning underlines why the company is pressing the CAA so hard for a price increase. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has also pleaded with governments to continue their financial support for the aviation sector. The industry body warned on Wednesday that airlines could continue to burn cash into 2022 amid uncertainty around when restrictions will ease. It estimated that aviation firms burnt through $77bn (Â£54.6bn) in cash during the second half of 2020 alone. Its boss Alexandre de Juniac told the BBC: ""The crisis is not over. ""If you want us to be alive when the restart will come, when the traffic will recover, which is not before the second half of 2021... We need support with additional financial help."" It is currently working on a ""Covid travel pass"", an app which could be used to verify if a passenger has had the Covid-19 tests or vaccines required to enter a country. The director general said in a BBC interview on Wednesday that it is talking to the UK government about using its app. He played down concerns about the security of any app-based system: ""It's pretty well done and designed for that purpose"". Mr de Juniac said the focus was on passengers controlling their data and that ""there is no information that is stored in any database that the government control or IATA control at all.""

"Chinese women spend nearly four hours a day on unpaid work, according to OECD statistics A Beijing divorce court has ordered a man to compensate his wife for the housework she did during their marriage, in a landmark ruling. The woman will receive 50,000 yuan ($7,700; Â£5,460) for five years of unpaid labour. The case has generated a huge debate online over the value of domestic work, with some saying the compensation amount was too little. The ruling comes after China's introduction of a new civil code. The 'punchline queen' who offended Chinese men 'Banshee, shrew': An angry song wants women to be seen According to court records, the man identified by his surname Chen had filed for divorce last year from his wife, surnamed Wang, after getting married in 2015. She was reluctant to divorce at first, but later requested financial compensation, arguing that Chen had not shouldered any housework or childcare responsibilities for their son. Beijing's Fangshan District Court ruled in her favour, ordering him to pay her monthly alimony of 2,000 yuan, as well as the one-off payment of 50,000 yuan for the housework she has done. The presiding judge told reporters on Monday that the division of a couple's joint property after marriage usually entails splitting tangible property. ""But housework constitutes intangible property value,"" said the judge. The ruling was made according to the new civil code in the country, which came into effect this year. Under the new law, a spouse is entitled to seek compensation in a divorce if he or she bears more responsibility in child raising, caring for elderly relatives, and assisting partners in their work.

"The WHO and Unicef said the delivery was a momentous occasion Ghana has become the first country to receive coronavirus vaccines through the Covax vaccine-sharing initiative. A delivery of 600,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine arrived in Accra on Wednesday. The first recipients are due to be healthcare workers. The Covax scheme aims to reduce the divide between rich countries and poorer nations unable to buy doses. The programme is planning to deliver about two billion vaccine doses globally by the end of the year. Ghana, which has a population of over 30m, was chosen as the first recipient of the free vaccines after promising quick distribution and meeting the criteria set by Covax. Further deliveries are expected to neighbouring Ivory Coast later this week, the Covax alliance says. Vaccinations are expected to start in Ghana next week, and, as well as health workers, those over 60, people with underlying health conditions, and senior officials are due to be prioritised. The vaccines delivered to Accra were produced by the Serum Institute of India and developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University. The vaccine has been approved by the World Health Organization (WHO) and its roll-out in Ghana is not part of a trial. The doses being sent to lower-income countries such as Ghana are funded by donations. As well as procuring and delivering the vaccines, Covax partners are supporting local authorities in areas such as training people to administer the jabs and helping provide an adequate cold-chain storage and delivery system.       Source: Our World in Data  Many nations in the developed world, which began their own vaccinations months ago, have faced criticism for buying or ordering more vaccines than they need. But many of those countries placed orders for doses with pharmaceutical companies before knowing whether the vaccine in development would be effective. They were hedging their bets - placing multiple orders in the hope that at least some of them would work out. The UK, which has ordered 400 million vaccine doses and will have many left over, has said itwill donate most of its surplus vaccine supply to poorer countries. This video can not be played Covax vaccine plan: What is it and how will it work? The Covax scheme is led by the WHO and also involves the Global Vaccine Alliance (Gavi) and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (Cepi). In a joint statement, the WHO and the United Nations children's fund (Unicef) saidit was a momentous occasion,externaland ""critical in bringing the pandemic to an end"". Find out how the roll-out is going near you The scheme to share unused vaccines with other countries The slow rollout of Covid vaccinations in Africa The cost of not counting the dead Ghana has recorded more than 80,700 cases of coronavirus and 580 deaths since the pandemic began. These numbers are believed to fall short of the actual toll because of low levels of testing. Though the vaccines are not generally intended for children, Unicef is involved in the scheme because of its expertise in procurement and the logistics of vaccine delivery. The Covax scheme was set up by the WHO, the Gavi vaccines alliance and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) to try to prevent poorer countries from being pushed to the back of the queue. The programme is designed so that richer countries buying vaccines agree to help finance access for poorer nations, too. It hopes to deliver more than two billion doses to people in 190 countries in less than a year. In particular, it wants to ensure 92 poorer countries will receive access to vaccines at the same time as 98 wealthier countries. The AstraZeneca vaccine is known as Covishield in India, where the doses delivered to Ghana were made It aims to reach up to 20% of the populations of poorer countries, at no cost to their governments. Most African countries are intended recipients of Covax, buta number of them such as Senegal have been making provisions for vaccines outside the initiative. Commenting on Wednesday's first shipment, the Director-General of the WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said it was a major first step but just the beginning. ""We will not end the pandemic anywhere unless we end it everywhere"", he added. Coronavirus cases, deaths, vaccinations by country Analysis by BBC Africa health editor Anne Mawathe The arrival of the first Covax vaccines in Ghana follows sharp criticism that African countries could be left behind in the fight against Covid-19. Western countries have been condemned for their rush to purchase more vaccines than they needed, leaving little left over for the rest of the world. But this is just a start. Ghana, a country with a population of about 31 million people, has now got a total of 600,000 doses of the vaccine. Africa, a continent with about 1.4 billion people, is largely still waiting on Covax to deliver. It is unlikely that many governments on the continent will go to the market and fight it out with countries with more financial muscle. In fact, most African countries will be buying the vaccines at a higher price than their Western counterparts, partly because they didn't pre-order. Some have called for the big pharmaceutical companies to stop blocking a patent waiver, which would lead to lower prices and mean more vaccine would be produced. But the companies have not agreed to this, knowing it could dent any profit margin. Covax has so far raised $6bn (Â£4.3bn), but says it needs at least another $2bn to meet its target for 2021. The scheme has faced some criticism for not moving quickly enough. One WHO board member, Austria's Dr Clemens Martin Auer, said it had been slow to secure vaccine deals and deliver doses. The joint statement on Wednesday said the shipment to Ghana represented ""the beginning of what should be the largest vaccine procurement and supply operation in history"". Nana Kofi Quakyi, who is a health policy research fellow at New York University's School of Global Public Health, told the BBC that Ghana would still struggle to compete with wealthier nations to make up the shortfall in doses it needed to find, even with the Covax initiative. ""The challenge that countries like Ghana are having is that in an open market, our bargaining power for bilateral deals is just not competitive against other wealthier countries that... in some cases, are buying more than they even need.""

"Heathrow Airport has reported a Â£2bn annual loss after passenger numbers during the coronavirus pandemic dropped to levels last seen in the 1970s. It said 2020 was the toughest year in its 75-year history and the loss ""underlines the devastating impact of Covid-19 on aviation"". Heathrow's results contained a warning it may not be able to carry on if passenger numbers remain low. However, its boss said the airport had enough money to cope until 2023. John Holland-Kaye also told the BBC that he thought people would be likely to be able to go on their summer holidays. Under the UK government's roadmap out of lockdown, which was published on Monday, international travel might be able to resume in mid-May. ""For the aviation sector, we can start to plan ahead for 17 May to make sure we've got the people and the planes in place so that we can get, not just people on their holidays, but also start to get British businesses moving again,"" he said. Mr Holland-Kaye said it was likely that travel to the UK from ""low-risk"" countries such as New Zealand and Singapore would not require a Covid test, ""medium-risk"" countries where passengers would need a test, and ""high risk"" countries would require tougher passenger controls such as quarantining. The UK is in discussions with G7 countries and others as to how to allow greater foreign travel, withtalks underway with some countries about a potential passport scheme. Mr Holland-Kaye said that a digital vaccine passport and international agreements would be needed to speed up travel at airports. Currently it takes about 20 minutes per passenger at Heathrow to sort out the necessary paperwork, which will not be feasible when passenger numbers pick up, he said.

Heathrow normally has about 80 million passengers per year, but it said numbers in 2020 dropped to 22 million, with more than half of those travelling in January and February before the coronavirus crisis took hold. In the long-term, if passenger numbers were to drop below 27 million, Heathrow would be in danger of breaching deals it has with creditors, it said. In January, the governmentopened a financial support scheme for airports in England, which included Â£8m per applicant to be used to cover fixed costs such as business rates. On Wednesday, Heathrow called on Chancellor Rishi Sunak to use next week's Budget to extend the furlough scheme and give a 100% business rates holiday to give additional support to the aviation sector. Heathrow doesn't have many passengers at the moment, but one thing it does have a lot of is borrowing. The London airport has built a Â£15bn debt pile in the past decade while paying its shareholders several billion pounds in dividends. The collapse in traffic caused by the coronavirus pandemic has understandably put a strain on its finances, to the extent that the company has asked the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), its economic regulator, for an increase in prices to compensate. The request has outraged its airline customers, who say they and their passengers should not have to pick up the airport's pandemic tab. There is no danger of Heathrow running out of money in the short term - it has about Â£4bn in cash, enough to keep it ticking over for two years - but the accounts do include a warning about the future. The directors say that the uncertainty about the timescale and nature of the recovery from the pandemic ""indicates the existence of a material uncertainty which could cast significant doubt upon the group and the company's ability to continue as a going concern"". It would take a serious prolongation of traffic restrictions for Heathrow's current financial structure to crack - but the warning underlines why the company is pressing the CAA so hard for a price increase. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has also pleaded with governments to continue their financial support for the aviation sector. The industry body warned on Wednesday that airlines could continue to burn cash into 2022 amid uncertainty around when restrictions will ease. It estimated that aviation firms burnt through $77bn (Â£54.6bn) in cash during the second half of 2020 alone. Its boss Alexandre de Juniac told the BBC: ""The crisis is not over.

"Chinese women spend nearly four hours a day on unpaid work, according to OECD statistics A Beijing divorce court has ordered a man to compensate his wife for the housework she did during their marriage, in a landmark ruling. The woman will receive 50,000 yuan ($7,700; Â£5,460) for five years of unpaid labour. The case has generated a huge debate online over the value of domestic work, with some saying the compensation amount was too little. The ruling comes after China's introduction of a new civil code. The 'punchline queen' who offended Chinese men 'Banshee, shrew': An angry song wants women to be seen According to court records, the man identified by his surname Chen had filed for divorce last year from his wife, surnamed Wang, after getting married in 2015. She was reluctant to divorce at first, but later requested financial compensation, arguing that Chen had not shouldered any housework or childcare responsibilities for their son. Beijing's Fangshan District Court ruled in her favour, ordering him to pay her monthly alimony of 2,000 yuan, as well as the one-off payment of 50,000 yuan for the housework she has done. The presiding judge told reporters on Monday that the division of a couple's joint property after marriage usually entails splitting tangible property. ""But housework constitutes intangible property value,"" said the judge. The ruling was made according to the new civil code in the country, which came into effect this year. Under the new law, a spouse is entitled to seek compensation in a divorce if he or she bears more responsibility in child raising, caring for elderly relatives, and assisting partners in their work. Previously, divorcing spouses could only request  such compensation if a prenuptial agreement had been signed - an uncommon practice in China. On social media, the case sparked heated debate, with a related hashtag on microblogging platform Weibo viewed more than 570 million times. Some social media users pointed out that 50,000 yuan for five years' of work was too little. ""I'm a bit speechless, the work of a full-time housewife is being underestimated.

"This video can not be played From trophies to torment - how Lennon's second Celtic stint unfolded Celtic manager Neil Lennon has resigned with his side 18 points adrift of Rangers in the Scottish Premiership. Lennon took charge for a second spell in February 2019 when Brendan Rodgers left and led the club to two titles, two Scottish Cups and a League Cup. However, Celtic are well behind their Glasgow rivals in their bid to win 10-straight titles and slumped to defeat at struggling Ross County on Sunday. Assistant manager John Kennedy will take interim charge of the team. 'Lennon's successes will outlive all of us' The key games that ended Lennon's reign Clarke front-runner to replace Lennon - gossip Podcast: Howe? Martinez? Marsch? Who are the contenders? ""We have experienced a difficult season due to so many factors and it is very frustrating and disappointing that we have not been able to hit the same heights as we did previously,"" Lennon said. ""I have worked as hard as ever to try and turn things around, but unfortunately we have not managed to get the kind of run going that we have needed. ""I have always given my best to the club and have been proud to deliver silverware to the Celtic supporters. The club will always be part of me. I will always be a Celtic supporter myself and I will always want the best for Celtic."" Celtic chief executive Peter Lawwell:""Neil has always been and will always be a true Celtic man and someone I will always hold in the highest regard. Personally, it is a sad day for me to see Neil leave. Neil is a man of quality and decency, he is someone who will always be part of the fabric of Celtic and someone who will always be welcomed.""

Principal shareholder Dermot Desmond:""Neil is a Celtic legend both as a player and manager. He has given so much to the club, and with his success over the last number of years - including winning a treble in his own right - he will be very difficult to replace."" Celtic captain Scott Brown:""He's supported Celtic his whole life and he wanted to play for this club - he won a treble as a player, as well as a manager. He's given 15-20 years to this club and he deserves respect, and also praise for what he's done for the club and the success he brought us. I probably wouldn't still be captain at Celtic if it wasn't for Neil Lennon."" Former Celtic defender Gary Caldwell:""It was inevitable. The results just haven't been good enough and I feel for Neil because I was there as a player with him and he's given his life to Celtic. But the club had to make a decision to move forward."" Rangers manager Steven Gerrard:""I can't say I'm surprised because of what's been going on over there. But I obviously take no personal satisfaction, so I wish him well for the future."" Former Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers:""When it all settles down, Neil is an incredible legend of the club, he has given so much service to the club, won so many titles and like I say, his legacy there will be intact forever."" Former Rangers manager Ally McCoist:""Hopefully he can get some sanity back in his life and go and enjoy himself and relax with his family for a period. The season for Celtic has been one disaster after another, and there are a lot of people responsible for that."" Ross County manager John Hughes:""My heart goes out to Lenny. I pay tribute to his accomplishments and success he has had. He will be hurting."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

BBC Scotland's sports news correspondent Chris McLaughlin This is something we've been expected for some time, and it comes as a surprise that it hasn't happened before now, even for the man himself. The defeat at Ross County seems to have been the last straw. The Celtic board have been in talks about this over the past few days. Lennon delivered the unprecedented quadruple treble, but he has had major struggles with the side this season and Rangers are now just seven points away from stopping Celtic making it 10 titles in a row. This video can not be played Watch Lennon's last post-match interview as Celtic manager The majority of the fans have been calling for him to step aside for some time now. It will take time for the dust to settle but I would imagine in the next couple of seasons, Celtic fans will look back with fondness on Neil Lennon as both player and manager. Lennon answered Celtic's call in early 2019, when Rodgers departed mid-season for Leicester City, and guided the club to their eighth league crown in a row while securing a third-straight Scottish Cup. After Celtic beat Hearts in the final, he was offered the job on a permanent basis by Lawwell in the Hampden showers. This video can not be played 'Horrific' defending from Celtic - analysis Last season was called early amid the coronavirus pandemic, with Celtic handsomely ahead of Rangers and crowned champions, having also defeated their rivals in the League Cup showpiece. But this term, as the club pursued an unprecedented 10th league title in succession, things unravelled spectacularly. Celtic were eliminated from the second round of Champions League qualifiers at home by Ferencvaros, and won just one of their six Europa League group games. Although they won nine of their opening 10 league fixtures, they lost the first two Old Firm derbies of the term, and dropped points to Aberdeen, Hibernian, St Johnstone and Livingston. Their incredible run of 35 domestic cup wins was ended by Ross County, who prevailed 2-0 at Celtic Park in the League Cup last 16. That led to fan protests and clashes with police outside the stadium. Lennon oversaw more Scottish Cup success in December, as Celtic won the 2019-20 trophy on penalties despite losing a 2-0 lead against Hearts, ensuring the Northern Irishman became the first man to win a treble as player and manager, and sealed a Scottish-first quadruple treble. But the glory was short-lived. Celtic lost at home to St Mirren in January, and despite holding games in hand, remained well shy of Rangers, who are yet to lose a league match this season. Sunday's 1-0 loss to County, who were bottom of the table heading into the fixture, sealed Lennon's fate, with Rangers on the brink of ending their domestic supremacy.

"Mr Trudeau appeared on screen for the meeting and subsequent statement US President Joe Biden has spoken to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in his first bilateral meeting with a foreign leader since taking office. The two leaders highlighted mutual policy priorities around climate change and China. They vowed to align climate goals to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. And Mr Biden said the US would help Canada secure the release of two Canadians held by Beijing, saying they were not bartering chips. Canada is often the destination chosen for a US president's first foreign trip, but Covid-19 scuppered Mr Biden's plans. Instead, the meeting was held remotely. Mr Biden, a Democrat, is hoping to hit the reset button with Mr Trudeau, a Liberal, whose relationship with the former Republican US President Trump was often considered rocky. Mr Trudeau also pledged to work with the US to ""get through Covid but also to make sure we're pulling our weight around the world"". The leaders did not take questions from journalists, which is unusual in Washington for a bilateral event such as this. Mr Trudeau in his opening remarks criticised the Trump administration, and thanked Mr Biden for ""stepping up"". The prime minister added: ""As we are preparing the joint rollout and communique... it's nice when the Americans aren't pulling out all references to climate change."" But the two leaders did not publicly comment on the White House's decision to cancel the Keystone XL pipeline project, which would have boosted oil supplies from Canada's Alberta province to US refineries. Why is the Keystone XL pipeline so disputed? Why I fought for - or against - Keystone XL In a phone call two days after Mr Biden took office - Mr Biden's first official call as president - Mr Trudeauconveyed his ""disappointment""at the pipeline decision. A US official later said the closure would ""not be reconsidered"". Development of the pipeline was originally blocked by the Obama administration in 2015, but former President Donald Trump overturned that order and allowed it go ahead. This video can not be played How much did climate change cost the US economy in 2020? The project has been bitterly opposed by environmentalists and Native American groups for more than a decade. They see it as highly polluting and potentially a major setback to efforts to move away from fossil fuels. Industry groups say it would create thousands of jobs and increase US energy security. Earlier on Tuesday, US Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters Mr Biden had made clear to Mr Trudeau that the project was ""not in the interests of the United States and that we want to try to address our climate crisis, while also creating good paying union jobs"". The US and Canada share one of the world's largest trade partnerships, and exchange close to $2bn (C$2.5bn/Â£1.4bn) in goods and services daily. It lacked much of the pageantry of an official bilateral meeting of leaders at the White House, but both Joe Biden and Justin Trudeau expressed optimism that US-Canadian relations were poised to take a turn for the better after Donald Trump's tumultuous four years in the White House. ""US leadership has been sorely missed over the past years,"" Trudeau told his American counterpart at the beginning of what was, essentially, a glorified video conference. He was speaking of the US's changed attitude toward climate change, but that kind of sentiment permeated the public portions of the day's events. Trudeau had very publicly clashed with Trump, in a war of words conducted via duelling press releases and tweets. Now, Trudeau said, he was looking forward to working closely with the US again. By the time the day was over, in their closing statements, Trudeau was referring to Biden as ""Joe,"" and Biden was pledging to Trudeau - who towered on a massive screen beside him - that the US ""has no closer and no more important friend than Canada"". The two nations still have notable differences - on trade and oil pipeline construction in particular - but at least for a day, it was all smiles and promises of better days to come. One major issue for both leaders is the Chinese detention of two Canadians, who have been accused of spying and held in jail since 2018. Canada pair 'not been tried' despite China reports The PowerPoint that sparked an international row Canada alleges that the men were arrested as retribution for the arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou on a US warrant. Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig were arrested in China in 2018 and formally indicted in June 2020. Calling for their release in remarks following the meeting, Mr Biden said: ""Human beings are not bartering chips. We're going to work together until we get their safe return.""

"The victims' commissioner for England and Wales has called for a law to ensure people affected by crime are treated properly as they wait for justice. Dame Vera Baird QC said victims had for too long been treated like bystanders. She said mounting evidence of a loss of confidence in criminal justice was driven by people's experiences. The government is introducing a new victims' code and has promised to consult on creating legal rights. In a wide-ranging report, Dame Vera said falling confidence in criminal justice could only be restored by treating victims as participants rather than outsiders in events that could have been pivotal moments in their lives. She calls for the police, courts and prosecutors to be made legally accountable for basic standards of care: Victims should be fully informed about what's happening with an investigation Vulnerable victims should have a guarantee of specialist support Rape complainants should get free legal advice before they hand over access to their social media, the contents of which may be used in a trial ""There is a collapse in confidence and it is not just about Covid [backlogs in courts], and it's not just about delay,"" Dame Vera told the BBC. ""It is very largely to do with how people are treated."" She said that a victims' law would be a once in a generation landmark piece of legislation that would transform experiences. ""We are trying to put the victim at the centre of the criminal justice system. The defendant stays securely where they are, well protected. But at the moment, because all the focus is on prosecuting, investigating and making sure that the defendant has a fair trial, nobody's duty is to look after a victim."" Dame Vera recommends that compensation due to a victim should be paid to them directly by the court. Under the current system, offenders often pay tiny instalments to the court because of their limited means, meaning it takes years for the money to come through. She also calls for people who have experienced anti-social behaviour to be recognised as victims of crime and given appropriate support. Is four years too long to wait for justice? While a specific victims' law would be entirely new in England and Wales, it has been successfully implemented in parts of Australia, which has the same style of criminal justice system. Conservative governments have promised for six years to place a legal duty on the criminal justice system to properly look after victims. Ministers say they will consult on that proposal later this year - 30 years after the first code of conduct towards victims was published. The latest version of that code will be introduced in April - but critics say that without legal teeth many victims will not benefit from its promises to ensure they are listened to and kept informed. Labour hasseparately launched its own attempt to create a victims' law, although it stands virtually no chance of becoming law. A government spokesperson said: ""Our new code enhances the rights of victims at every stage of the justice process. But we plan to go further, strengthening and enshrining these rights in a new victims' law. ""We are also investing millions in vital support services, recruiting more independent sexual and domestic abuse advisers, and reviewing the entire response to rape to build back confidence in the justice system.""

"This video can not be played ""I was adamant that I wanted a biological child of my own"" Stephen Dyer always wanted to be a father. In a relationship for five years, he discussed starting a family with his partner. Then, last May, his partner had a change of heart and they separated. For Stephen it was a turning point. He decided to start looking at how to become a father with a surrogate. He is one of a small, but believed to be growing, number of men who have decided to have children through IVF. ""I thought - I'm 34, I have time but do I want to put myself through another three or four-year relationship only to reach the same point?"" said Stephen. There are an increasing number of single women becoming mothers through IVF, however there are no statistics about the number of single men doing so. Surrogacy UK, who help introduce so-called 'intended parents' with surrogates, said they have seen an increase in the number of single people, including men, wanting to become members. Coronavirus splits couple from baby born 8,000 miles away Surrogate parents 'should be at birth' in lockdown Prada drops actress over alleged surrogacy row ""I'm an only child. I didn't come out as gay until I was 26 partly because I didn't want to let down my parents, as I didn't want them to think they weren't going to have grandchildren,"" Stephen said. The secondary school teacher looked at surrogacy in 2014 but then met his ex-partner. ""After our relationship broke down I felt like, I was happy to do it single before, and I am now,"" he said. ""There are a range of ways you can do it, not just surrogacy. There's co-parenting or adoption, but I have a deep burning desire for a biological child. ""Myself and my ex-partner were registered foster parents for a time and I looked at adoption, but in the end I wanted to experience biological fatherhood."" Stephen reached a ""turning point"" in his life after separating from his partner It was the start of a journey he's only part-way through. Having settled on host surrogacy, where an embryo is created with a donor egg and carried by a surrogate, he expects the costs to be up to Â£40,000. It means he has had to re-mortgage his home in Newport. ""I'll do anything that I possibly can to realise my dream of becoming a father,"" he said. Until January 2019, a single man could not have a child through surrogacy and be legally recognised as the only parent. A surrogate who carries a child is always named as a parent on a birth certificate. The intended parents must apply for a parental order to change that, which can take months. Now a single man or woman can apply for a parental order to remove the surrogate with a single parent named instead. The number of children born this way is about 10 times greater than a decade ago. It has become so common that the Law Commission is reviewing surrogacy laws. Stephen, whoblogs about his experience,external, knows a number of single men considering fatherhood through surrogacy. He said: ""There's a Facebook group for single men, not just gay but straight men too, and people are coming forward and saying, 'You know, I want this as well, this is my dream'. ""We have become a community of single men who want to become dads."" In November his clinic found him an egg donor. Stephen, pictured with his terrier Tor, decided to try and become a dad using a surrogate He said: ""They emailed to say I would be the sole recipient of the eggs. She's in her thirties, has blue eyes, dark blonde hair, olive skin, is 1.68m tall, weighs 88kg, doesn't have children and likes theatre, nature, animals and books."" Two months later she donated her eggs and Stephen was called by the clinic the next day. Five eggs were fertilised. ""A week later two embryos had been created, which remain on ice in the clinic,"" he said. ""I really hope that by this time next year, one of these will be growing into a little person."" David Watkins, from Southampton, wasone of the first single fathers to be granted a parental orderas a single father in the UK after his son Miles was born last year. He has started up a website to help other men thinking of going it alone. ""A lot of single men have just accepted the fact that they're never going to have biological children they don't even know that the law has changed,"" he said. ""But now people are learning about the new changes in the law, I have noticed an increase in traffic and inquiries from single men who are looking to be dads on the website, in the last year."" For Stephen the next step is finding a surrogate. This can take months and cost thousands of pounds in expenses. ""Hopefully I'll be able to find, or somebody will come forward and help me realise my dreams of becoming a dad,"" he said. ""And who knows, maybe in 12 or 18 months time I might I might have my own little mini-me running around?"" He hopes the surrogate will become a ""friend and family"". ""I always anticipated I would have a partner or there will be somebody with me to bring the child up together,"" he said. ""But you can do it on your own, it is possible. ""It is not quite as easy as having a child could be, but I'm excited to be a father. I can't wait."" Watch Wales Live on BBC One Wales at 22:35 GMT on Wednesday and on the BBC iPlayer.

"This video can not be played Watch the moment Tiger Woods wins the 2019 Masters 3,954 days. That is how long Tiger Woods has waited to win his 15th major. In the time between the 2008 US Open and Sunday'striumph at the Masters, Woods has gone through a series ofhighs and lows. The American started just 24 events in a four-year period. A public admission of infidelity and the breakdown of his marriage led to him taking a break from golf. The former world number one returned but then had injuries and back surgeries, slipped down the rankings, and even thought his career was over. His off-course problems also continued when he was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence in 2017. But now at the age of 43, he has won at Augusta for the first time since 2005. Here is how his fellow sporting greats, politicians and Hollywood actors reacted on social media to the ""greatest comeback story in sport"". Woods had spinal fusion surgery in April 2017 and has had four back surgeries in his career. Twenty-three time Grand Slam tennis championSerena Williamshas struggled with injuries throughout her career and has twice suffered a pulmonary embolism. ""I am literally in tears watching Tiger Woods, this is Greatness like no other,"" the American tweeted. ""Knowing all you have been through physically to come back and do what you just did today? Wow. Congrats a million times! I am so inspired."" Six-time NBA all-starStephen Currycalled Woods' victory ""the greatest comeback story in sports"" and asked Woods if he could ""hold one of those five jackets one time!"" Former LA Lakers legendKobe Bryantkept things simple... Former basketball playerMagic Johnsonposted that ""the roar of the Tiger is back"" whileTom Brady,who won a record sixth Super Bowl in February, spent the evening ""running the numbers on how long it'll take me to get to 15"". Real Madrid and Wales footballerGareth Balealso celebrated Woods' victory. Former US PresidentBarack Obama, who played a round of golf with Woods during his time in office, paid tribute to Woods' determination after a difficult few years. ""To come back and win the Masters after all the highs and lows is a testament to excellence, grit and determination,"" he wrote. US PresidentDonald Trumpsaid he loved ""people who are great under pressure. What a fantastic life comeback for a really great guy!"" For BBC Sport presenterGary Lineker,Woods' victory was the ""second most thrilling sporting achievement I've seen"". The best? Leicester winning the Premier League title in 2016 as huge underdogs, of course. ""There's something in my eye,"" Lineker tweeted. ""To use a phrase once used before about Tiger Woods - 'Oh my goodness...Wow....In your life have you seen anything like that?'"" Former tennis world number oneChris Evertsaid: ""Tiger has shown us all that you can always come back, in sport and in life, if you put in the work"". Legendary former England cricketerIan Bothamcalled Woods' victory ""one of the biggest inspirational performances... Who said he wouldn't win another major... no. 15 and more to come"". Australian actorHugh Jackmanwas also keeping an eye on proceedings in Augusta... Woods' former coachButch Harmontold Sky Sports: ""I've never seen him show emotion like that. At any time, anywhere, any time in his life. ""He was humbled by his own mistakes, the things he went through he created, nobody else created them, and he came out the other side. ""He got himself help, he got his body right, he got his head right and he went to work on his game. I couldn't be happier for him and his family."" Phil Mickelsonsaid of his long-time rival Woods: ""I'm so impressed by his incredible performance and I'm so happy for him to capture another Green Jacket. Truly a special day that will go down in history"". Eighteen-time major winnerJack Nicklaustweeted he was ""so happy for him and for the game of golf. This is just fantastic,"" whileBubba Watsonsaid he was ""thankful to get to see that in person"" along with the hashtag #Needs 4 more majors. The European Tour put Woods' road to his 15th major title into perspective... England'sIan Poulter,who finished with a share of 12th, wrote ""A couple of mistakes were very costly today. But a day we will remember as @tigerwoods comeback incredible. What he has done for the game of golf can't be quantified. We all owe a lot to him for that. Respect. Enjoy number 15 Mr Woods."" The first person Woods ran to after sinking the winning putt was his son, Charlie. Twenty-two years ago, Woods' father, Earl, had embraced him as he claimed his first Masters victory. And one Twitter account shared the letter that Earl wrote to his 21-year-old son after he became the Augusta champion.

"Secondary schools in England will be asked to consider delivering face-to-face summer schools as part of efforts to help pupils catch up. An extra Â£400m in funding has been announced, along with Â£300m announced for catch-up projects in January. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the money will help ensure ""no child is left behind"" due to the pandemic. Teachers, experts and unions called the money a ""good start"" - but warned about overwhelming pupils and teachers. The prime minister has confirmed all pupils will return to classrooms from 8 March as part of the first step ofa roadmap,externalfor easing England's lockdown. With secondary school pupils being asked to take three Covid-19 tests in school when they come back, it is likely that secondary schools will have to stagger the return over a few days. 5 ways children could make up for lost school time Telling children to catch up 'adds huge pressure' Heads warn against 'grinding out hours' in summer As part of the latest announcements, schools will have the option to run summer classes for pupils who need it most, potentially starting with those who will be moving up to Year 7 at secondary school this year. The government says it will be up to schools to decide how and if they run summer schools, how long they will be, and which pupils will be invited to attend. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said ""we're giving schools the option to be able to draw down on this funding"". He said the average primary school will also receive around Â£6,000 in extra money, with the average secondary school getting around Â£22,000 extra in recovery premium payments. It would be up to head teachers to decide how to use the money - it could be used, for example to pay teachers for overtime to do extra teaching. The government's Â£700m education support package for England includes: A one-off Â£302m ""recovery premium"" for state primary and secondary schools to boost summer schooling, clubs and activities Â£200m to fund face-to-face secondary summer schools, with teachers in charge of deciding which pupils benefit An expanded national tutoring programme for primary and secondary pupils and an extended tuition fund for 16 to 19-year-olds - also worth Â£200m That includes Â£18m funding to support early-years language development This video can not be played Can children catch and spread coronavirus? Last year, Mr Johnson announced a Â£1bn catch-up fund for England, and later appointed Sir Kevan Collins as education recovery commissioner. In Scotland, the administration has promised Â£140m in funding to help disadvantaged pupils. Tens of millions of pounds have also been put into catch-up schemes in Wales and Northern Ireland. The announcement comes as the Treasury has said its levelling-up fund will be extended to the whole of the UK to ""help boost growth"" in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Chief secretary to the Treasury, Stephen Barclay, said communities in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland would now all benefit from at least Â£800m of investment for town centre and high street regeneration, local transport, cultural and heritage projects. On the subject of masks in schools, Mr Williamson said the policy of secondary pupils in England having to wear face coverings in classrooms would be reviewed over the Easter holiays. Most pupils will have to wear face coverings indoors, including in classrooms where social distancing isn't possible. He did not rule out that the policy could remain in place until 21 June, which is the final date in plans to ease lockdown. The government had considered a variety of options for pupils - including extended school days and shorter summer holidays - but neither of these proposals form part of the plan set out on Wednesday. Asked whether extending the school day could be among future measures, Mr Williamson told Sky News: ""We'll be looking at how we can boost and support children in a whole range of different manners. ""But it's not just about time in school it's about supporting teachers in terms of the quality of teaching and how we can help them."" Exams this year have already been cancelled in England, but Mr Williamson said more detail on how grades will be calculated is expected on Thursday. Mother-of-three Emily Ellarby says her children are ""jaded"" by online learning and are ready to be back at school. But she says it would be ""hard to get them motivated"" for more school over the summer. ""They're looking forward to the summer holidays and having a proper break."" She says ultimately children just want to get back to school and normal life. ""They're quite keen to go back, they're looking forward to seeing their friends, they want that normality."" Father-of-two Nick Lee says children and teachers need a proper summer break, not more schooling. ""My children have suffered enough with this pandemic and they will not attend any summer camps. ""We have all struggled to cope in these hard times, and stealing my children's summer is not the way to go."" Nick Lee says he won't be sending his children to summer schools Sarah Baker, who has two children and a stepchild, says she is ""torn"" over the idea of catch-up lessons in the summer. ""They're all at really critical stages in their education, but they're also at critical stages in their personal development. So, I'm completely torn. Yes, of course, they need to catch up, but they also need to regroup."" And Sarah Webb, who has three children aged 11, eight and five, said children need time to recover from the past year, rather than more academic pressure. ""These children have missed out on social interaction and now need time to help readjust and come to terms with their experiences, not being given more time and pressure to bring them back up to academic standards that can simply no longer apply to them."" Kate Green, Labour's shadow education secretary, said the new funding ""will not make up for the learning and time with friends that children have lost"". ""There is no specific mention of supporting children's mental health or wellbeing, which is fundamental to enabling their recovery from this pandemic,"" she said. Labour also calculated the new package was worth less than the Â£840m spent on the Eat Out to Help Out scheme last year, and would be worth 43p per pupil per day, if the money was split across a normal school year. School leaders' unions welcomed the funding but also warned of a long road ahead. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the NAHT - which represents head teachers - said summer schools ""will be of value for some pupils but it will be important not to overwhelm students"". Chris Zarraga, director of Schools North East, said any provision needed to focus on children's ""physical wellbeing, and social and emotional development"", but he also expressed concern about teacher morale. He said asking teachers, who were ""facilitating both in-class teaching and remote learning"", to work over the summer break was likely to ""exacerbate low morale"". By Dan Johnson, BBC News Just working out how to measure what each child has missed during the pandemic is tricky, let alone agreeing on the best way to address it and make sure they all achieve their potential. Many teachers are wary of talking about ""catching-up"" and pupils being ""left behind"" - they do not want to discourage young people. But there is widespread recognition that home learning could never fully replace classroom teaching and some pupils will need significant extra support when they get back to classrooms. The government is backing one-to-one and small group tuition, alongside summer school activities. Suggestions of a longer school day or a shorter summer holiday have not materialised. Many teachers feel they can best assess what their pupils need, but after a relentless year, they are tired and need help in some form. How that help is given and whether it reaches the right pupils will determine the lasting impact on the lives of children who've been through the most difficult school year.
