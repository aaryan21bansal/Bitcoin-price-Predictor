"The watch has a tiny, hidden microphone for a spy to secretly record conversations A vintage collection of secret service gadgets including a dagger disguised as a pen and a watch with a hidden microphone are to go on sale. The items - designed for British spies and troops caught behind enemy lines - date from World War Two onwards. The anonymous seller claims he was never a spy himself, simply a historian with a passion for anything from WW2. The objects are expected to fetch a total of thousands of pounds when they are sold at auction in Kent on Tuesday. This video can not be played This fountain pen concealed a dagger and could be worth up to Â£500 The James Bond-style collection of sinister yet ingenious items includes a badge which unscrews to reveal a compass, which is expected to fetch up to Â£120. There is also a key with a secret compartment for hiding things such as cyanide pills, which could be worth up to Â£200. Matthew Tredwin of C&T Auctioneers said: ""Most people that buy this stuff are historians who want to keep the story of these people alive."" The vendor said he would be ""over the moon if they fetched the estimates placed on them"". But he added: ""Money is not the concern. I would like to think they will go to a collector who will cherish them as much as I have over the years."" ""I have had the pleasure of owning them and feel it is time that another collector or museum has the opportunity,"" he added. The collection includes a button with a compass inside and a key with a secret compartment Spy gadgets up for auction.

"The Harry Potter painting took artist Hannah Weston ""several days over the course of two months"" to complete A 4ft-high painting of Harry Potter worth Â£700 has ""vanished"" in the post - leaving its creator short of a few Galleons. Hannah Weston, 26, said it took her several days to complete the 4ft by 3ft (1.2m by 0.9m) homage to the boy wizard. But the painting never made it to the Parcelforce depot near her Norwich home. The firm said it was ""unable to locate"" it and offered Â£125 in compensation. Tattoo artist Ms Weston, 26, said the situation was ""incredibly disheartening"". ""I poured days of my time, energy and passion into that huge painting,"" Ms Weston told the BBC. ""I painted Harry out of pure adoration for stories that have brought me joy and I hope that it ends up in the hands of someone who truly appreciates it."" She sold the painting to a woman who planned to give it to her daughter, who was ""obsessed with the Harry Potter books"", as a birthday present. Parcelforce came to pick up the parcel from Ms Weston's home, but when the buyer called to say she had not received the painting, the artist found out it had never arrived at the depot. A nationwide depot search was carried out but the painting was never found. ""The compensation I was offered - Â£125 - was ridiculous given that it wasn't an error or damage,"" Ms Weston said. ""The claims process was near impossible and I ended up having to borrow money to cover everything."" Ms Weston said she had not reported the incident to police as she had been told a missing parcel was not counted as a stolen item. In a statement, a Parcelforce spokeswoman apologised to Ms Weston ""that she has not received the service she expected and deserved from Parcelforce"".

"There is much rejoicing that the unit handling claims of abuse against British troops in Iraq is to be scrapped. Three papers believe their campaigns against the Iraq Historic Allegations Team (Ihat) played important parts in its downfall. ""At last, an end to the witch-hunt,""says the front-page headline in the Daily Mail,external. The paper believes what it calls the ""ruthless hounding of hundreds of innocent soldiers"" has been ""one of the most shameful chapters"" in the annals of British justice. It says the exercise has been a ""nice little earner"" for lawyers, agents, Iraqi civilians who received compensation and the Ihat investigators, while troops had their reputations ""smeared"". The Mail describes a separate inquiry - into killings carried out by British soldiers during the Troubles in Northern Ireland - as ""another, politically motivated witch-hunt"". The Sun condemns Ihat,externalfor ""blackening the Army's name"". It features the testimony of a former sergeant who says he was ""left to rot"" while lawyers investigated him for shooting an Iraqi who had been threatening his colleagues with an assault rifle. While the sergeant was cleared of unlawful killing, the ordeal left him with post-traumatic stress disorder. The Daily Telegraph also campaigned,externalfor Ihat to be shut down. Its leader column congratulates the government for taking action, but insists that ministers still need to explain why they endorsed the ""unfounded pursuit"" through the courts of people serving Queen and country. The paper believes the Iraq investigations amounted to an ""abuse of process"" which should have been abandoned much earlier. The Guardian leads on court documents,externalthat suggest Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson called for British arms sales to Saudi Arabia to continue, even after last October's bombing of a funeral in Yemen, which killed more than 140 people. The letters were disclosed this week during a judicial review of the decision to continue licensing weapons exports to Saudi Arabia. The case was brought by the Campaign Against Arms Trade. The paper argues that since Saudi airstrikes have hit hospitals, schools and weddings in Yemen, they are at the very least ""reckless"" and in many cases ""deliberate"". The Guardian concludes that arms sales to the kingdom are immoral and ministers should halt them immediately. The Daily Express says there has been an angry reaction,externalto reports that Brussels is preparing to hit the UK with a Â£49bn bill for leaving the EU. The paper says that figure is too much - in fact, at least Â£49bn too much. It argues that since the UK is one of only a handful of net contributors to the EU, ""they should be paying us"". There is potentially bad news for great crested newts in theFinancial Times,external, and it is down to - what else? - Brexit. The paper says the amphibians are facing a less certain future once Britain leaves the EU. It says it has been told by government sources that the EU habitats directive is to be repealed, as it gives ""excessive"" protection to great crested newts. The FT cites the example of the newt colony that held up the building of a railway station in Derbyshire. Despite attempts to catch and re-home the creatures, more just kept on turning up.

"In the world of viral news, it's a relative baby - but it's already become so controversial that a Nato spokesperson told BBC Trending thatSputnik,externalis an agent of Russian misinformation. Sputnik,externalwas set up in 2014 and puts out podcasts, radio shows and text stories which are shared thousands of times a day on Twitter and Facebook. It's recently been adding international bureaux, including a UK headquarters in Scotland. But at the same time Sputnik has also been on the receiving end of criticism - by US intelligence agencies, the British defence secretary, and now by Nato, who says it is part of a ""Kremlin misinformation machine."" Visit theTrending Facebook page,external ""Outlets like Sputnik are part of a Kremlin propaganda machine which are trying to use information for political and military needs,"" Nato spokesperson Oana Lungescu told BBC Trending. ""It is a way, not to convince people, but to confuse them, not to provide an alternative viewpoint, but to divide public opinions and to ultimately undermine our ability to understand what is going on and therefore take decisions if decisions need to be made."" Sputnik strongly denies the claims. ""It's extremely unfair but we've been on the receiving end of other similar accusations in the past, without any substantive evidence being provided,"" says Nikolai Gorshkov, Sputnik's UK editor. ""We prefer to leave those inclined towards this kind of conspiratorial thinking to it."" Sputnik's offices in Edinburgh So what's the truth about Sputnik? Many stories on Sputnik, whose motto is ""Telling the Untold"", are news items. Like other international broadcasters, it sees itself as a gift to the world to diversify the media diet - in this case, funded by the Russian government. But Western officials and outside observers say that Sputnik follows an anti-West, pro-Russia, pro-Trump line in its selection of stories, in the way it frames them, and its choice of commentary. On Friday evening, for instance, Sputnik's top story was headlined ""Americans 'Don't Buy' Media Criticism of Trump Following Years of Pro-Obama Bias,external"". A recent US intelligence report on alleged Russian interference in the American election described the editorial line of Sputnik and the TV station RT, which like Sputnik is funded by the Russian government-owned news agency Rossiya Segodnya. ""RT and Sputnik consistently cast President-elect Trump as the target of unfair coverage from traditional US media outlets that they claimed were subservient to a corrupt political establishment,"" the report said. ""The question of balance is really important - particularly if you're a public service broadcaster,"" says Ben Nimmo, a research fellow at the Atlantic Council, an international affairs think tank based in Washington DC. ""Balance is where so much of the time I see Sputnik falling down. It will quote one side but it won't give an appropriate screen time, column inches or airtime to the other side and that's the big difference."" Nimmo and others suggest that Sputnik's UK base in Edinburgh - rather than London, where most international media companies set up shop - is an attempt to encourage Scottish independence and stoke up discontent towards the British government. That's just not true, according to Sputnik themselves. Gorshkov says the reason for the Scottish base is more pragmatic. He cites the high cost of property prices in London and says he'd rather invest in journalists. ""We're not trying to influence Scottish thinking, because being based in Edinburgh, we do now realise how fiercely independently minded the Scots are,"" he says. ""You can't influence a Scot."" Hear this story in fullon the BBC World Service, ordownload our podcast In addition to its news coverage, Sputnik's sharply opinionated blogs have also been the subject of criticism. ""If you look at the byline of people who write commentaries for Sputnik or RT, a lot of them are extremely obscure individuals connected to the far right or the far left, or so-called specialists or experts who nobody's heard of,"" says Lungescu, the Nato spokesperson. ""You can always find somebody to say anything, but that doesn't make it journalism."" One of the bloggers heavily featured on the site, Angus Gallagher, specialises in pro-Russia, pro-Donald Trump pieces sharply critical of the West, with headlines such as ""7 ways the EU-NATO Axis is Sabotaging Western Civilisation,external"" and ""Sacrificed for the EU-NATO Axis: Europe's Women Branded Whores and Liars,external"". The latter article accuses Western think tanks of conspiring to play down reports of sex attacks by migrants, in an anti-Russian plot. Ammon Cheskin, a professor in Central and Eastern European studies at Glasgow University, says the posts are typical of the ""paranoid perspective"" of commentators on the site. ""No one is quite sure who this individual is or if he actually exists,"" he says. But Sputnik's UK editor Gorshkov told us that bloggers, including Gallagher, aren't members of staff, but rather are volunteers who use the Sputnik platform to write their opinion pieces. He says he's never met Gallagher and doesn't oversee the blogs section of the website. But he insisted that he is indeed a real person. ""He reflects the views of a good chunk of the audience,"" Gorshkov says. BBC Trending left Facebook messages left for Gallagher himself, but they went unanswered. The Russian embassy in London denied the accusations that the Kremlin is behind a misinformation machine. ""In our view, the claims of perceived 'Russian misinformation campaign to undermine the West' are a way to avoid an open and reasoned debate of the issues raised in British and American societies,"" the embassy press office wrote in an email. ""Obviously, sticking labels of 'fake news' and 'misinformation' testifies to the lack of [a] positive agenda."" Gorshkov says the criticisms against Sputnik have cascaded down from governments and think tanks because the establishment in Western countries feels threatened. ""They don't like the emergency of a mass media outlet which is giving more context, more background, more angles to stories. They probably think it's a threat to their view of the world,"" he says. And he hopes that Sputnik will reach Westerners disaffected by the mainstream media. ""Are they all Russian stooges who voted for Brexit or for Trump? Are they all useful idiots? That's really preposterous,"" he says. ""I think that's really an offence against them, all those millions.""

"Horses are a more popular artistic subject than dogs - that's one of 10 illuminating facts unearthed by BBC analysis of Art UK's digital archive, which catalogues more than 200,000 of the nation's oil paintings. This video can not be played Victorian pioneer Marianne North 'most prolific female artist' The woman with the most paintings in the collection is the Victorian botanist Marianne North. Born in 1830, North devoted her life to travelling the world and painting plants. There is agallery at Kew Gardens,externalin south-west London dedicated to her work. North had no formal training, according to the Kew website. However, she put her natural talent to ""prolific"" use on her travels. During an eight-month stay in Brazil, she finished more than 100 paintings. Instead of painting individual plants, her work typically showed landscapes and natural habitats. The Marianne North Gallery contains 833 paintings by the artist, showing more than 900 species of plant. North approached Kew and offered to build the gallery in return for her life's work being displayed in it. It opened in 1882. Anthony van Dyck (b. 1599) Equestrian Portrait of Charles I, The National Gallery, Art UK The Stuart king's execution in 1649 enshrined his statusas an object of fascination,externalfor artists. There are more than 200 paintings of Charles in the collection, about 40 more than his son, Charles II, who was restored to the monarchy in 1660. Andrew Ellis, director of Art UK, said: ""It does not surprise me that Charles I is the monarch with the most portraits. ""Not only was he the greatest of royal patrons and collectors of art but he was also keenly interested in how art could promote the image of kingship. Some of the portraits date from after his death includingone in King's Lynn Town Hall,external, which was the subject of a sonnet written for Art UK by the poet John Fuller."" JMW Turner (b. 1775), Sketch for East Cowes Castle, the Regatta Beating to Windward No.2, Tate, Art UK Maritime trade, sailing and naval power have longcaptured the imagination,externalof artists. We counted up the words used to describe the paintings in the collection. Boat (12th), sailing (14th), mast (16th), ship (17th), wave (18th), sea (22nd), sail (25th) and rigging (42nd) all feature in the top 50. Pieter van der Merwe, the general editor of the National Maritime Museum, said the emergence of the seascape as an art form in England was imported from the Netherlands in the 17th Century. ""It's a British taste, but where did we get the taste for maritime art? We did not invent it ourselves, we got it from the Dutch,"" he said. George Harvey (b. 1806), Horse, The Stirling Smith Art Gallery and Museum, Art UK We may be a nation of dog lovers, but there aremore horses than dogs,externalin the collection, according to the list of the most popular tags. The horse is the most popular animal tag (49th), followed by dog (132nd), bird (138th), cow (140th), sheep (172nd) and fish (200th). Pictured is the Scottish painter George Harvey's depiction of a horse from 1836. John Everett's 1,058 oil paintings formthe largest collection,externalby a male artist. Dorchester-born Everett, a well-connected Edwardian, was a graduate of the Slade School of Fine Art who lived his life according to his dual passions - painting and sailing. His life and work remained relatively unknown until art historian Gwen Yarker began researching his biography. The majority of his art lies in the storerooms of the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, while his landscapes can be viewed at Dorset County Museum. Ms Yarker said Everett shunned fame, was ambivalent about exhibiting and reluctant to take the limelight. ""Art history has not been kind to him,"" she said. Blasted Trees (blue version) by William Rothenstein (b 1872), Cartwright Hall Gallery, is one example of a painting donated in lieu of tax (Art UK) Works of art can be handed over instead of inheritance tax. Under the scheme, the government accepts the item at market value, and hands it over to a public museum or gallery. It is not known who painted this image of a tiger hunt, from the Artley Hall Museum and Art Gallery, Art UK Andrew Ellis said: ""We are aware that we are still missing key information for many of the paintings on the site. Who is the artist? Who is the sitter? Where is the landscape? ""TheArt Detective,externalsub-site of Art UK is helping to fill in some of this missing information with the incredible help of the general public."" Beatrice Offor (b. 1864), Miss B.S, Bruce Castle Museum (Haringey Culture, Libraries and Learning), Art UK BBC News examined the dates of the paintings in the collection. The median year was 1910, meaning half of the paintings we have a creation date for came before that date, and half afterwards. However, we could only ascertain dates for about half of the 214,000 artworks. Some 74,000 paintings had no year at all, and another 27,000 used either date ranges or other descriptions. Earlier works are less likely to be dated as record-keeping was poor. Andrew Ellis said: ""At the other end of the scale, some 50% of the collections on the site have fewer than 10 paintings."" What is Art UK? Charles-Louis-Auguste Cousin (b. 1807), A Venetian Byway, Museums Sheffield, Art UK Art UK's roots go back to 2002, when a charity, the Public Catalogue Foundation, was founded by Fred Hohler, who was determined to improve the public's access to the art it owned. The record started life as a series of hardback colour catalogues on a county-by-county basis. In 2011, the BBC and Public Catalogue Foundation launched the Your Paintings website to catalogue the collection online. Five years later, this became Art UK. The website was built with funding from Arts Council England, the Scottish government and a private foundation. More than 200,000 oil paintings by nearly 40,000 artists are available to view online The data analysed relates to the artwork in Art UK's digital archive.

"Castle View on Canvey Island hit the headlines in 2013 for banning triangular flapjacks after a student was injured by one A school is letting pupils who behave well during the day go home before those who do not, it has emerged. Castle View School on Canvey Island, Essex, said some pupils could finish at 14:50 if they had made ""the right decisions, every lesson of the day"". Others finish 10 minutes later in what the school calls a ""second dismissal"". An NUT official said he had not heard of a school doing this before, but that it was ""not that innovative"" if it was just another way of giving detentions. The academy trust school, which hit the headlines in 2013after banning triangular flapjacks, has about 1,100 students aged 11 to 16. Pupils at the school begin their day at 08:30 with first lessons starting by 08:50. In a letter to parents explaining the system, the school, rated""good"",externalby Ofsted, said: ""Our second dismissal system is designed to ensure students have an instant consequence that can be put right at the end of the day and start afresh the next day."" The BBC has asked the school whether the introduction of the new system had caused any issues for parents, but the school has yet to respond. Jerry Glazier, general secretary of the Essex branch of the National Union of Teachers (NUT) said he had not heard of schools having split-time endings before. ""Then again, perhaps it is not that innovative if most pupils are leaving at the normal time and the rest are getting detentions,"" he said. ""It is up to schools to determine what rewards or sanctions they want to use to motivate pupils."" Michelle Doyle Wildman, policy and communications director at PTA UK, which represents parents and teacher associations, said: ""PTA UK's position would be that its really important that parents are fully informed and preferably consulted on any changes to arrangements to the beginning and end of the school day. ""The best schools do see parents as key partners and will consider how they approach things from a parent and family perspective. ""This is especially relevant to parents juggling work and additional caring responsibilities.""

"Mark Warburton took Rangers training on Friday Rangers have replaced Mark Warburton as manager with under-20 coach Graeme Murty before Sunday's Scottish Cup tie with Greenock Morton. The Scottish Premiership club say they have accepted the resignations of Warburton, assistant David Weir and head of recruitment, Frank McParland. But Warburton, who took charge in 2015, told BBC Scotland he has not stood down and was unaware of the statement. And the 54-year-old Englishman is consulting his legal team. The BBC has learned that Warburton had contact with Nottingham Forest around 10 days ago and was high on the English Championship club's list of possible managers. However, he was not offered the job and they decided to retain their interim team of Gary Brazil and Jack Lester until the end of the season. Warburton, who had a contract at Ibrox until 2018, had taken Rangers' training on Friday as normal before Sunday's fifth-round tie. He had earlier in the morning defended McParland's record of signings after media criticism of the Glasgow club's recruitment. ""At a meeting with the management team's representative earlier this week, the club were advised that Mr Warburton, Mr Weir and Mr McParland wished to resign their positions and leave the club on condition that Rangers agreed to waive its rights to substantial compensation,"" said Rangers' statement. Who is Graeme Murty? Although born in England, Graeme Murty qualified to play for Scotland and won four caps between 2004 and 2007 The 42-year-old played for York, Reading, Charlton Athletic and Southampton in a career lasting 17 years and 437 games He won the Football League Championship with Reading in 2005/06. He has coached at Southampton and Norwich City, both at youth level Joined Rangers in August 2016 as head development squad coach ""Rangers' agreement to waive compensation would assist the management team to join another club. ""This compensation amount was agreed when Rangers significantly improved Mr Warburton and Mr Weir's financial arrangements before the start of this season. ""The board urgently convened to consider the offer made on behalf of the management team and its ramifications and agreed to accept it and release the trio from the burden of compensation, despite the potential financial cost to the club."" Rangers claim that Warburton's representative attempted to alter the the terms. ""A further board meeting was held this afternoon to discuss this and it was decided not to agree to this additional request but to hold with the original agreement,"" he said. ""Mr Warburton, Mr Weir, and Mr McParland have therefore been notified in writing that their notices of termination have been accepted."" Warburton led Rangers to the Championship title and promotion last season Rangers lie third in the Scottish top flight, but they are a distant 27 points behind city rivals and reigning champions Celtic and their statement went on to suggest that the management team have not reached the targets set. ""The board is very appreciative of the good work previously done by the management team but believes it had no alternative,"" it added. ""Our club must come first and absolute commitment is essential. ""It is important that Rangers has a football management team that wants to be at the club and that the board believes can take the club forward to meet our stated ambition to return to being the number one club in Scotland. ""We are clearly short of where we expected to be at this time."" Analysis: Chris McLaughlin, BBC Scotland senior football reporter Relations between Mark Warburton and the Rangers board have been strained for some time. The manner of the departure could never have been predicted, but the departure itself had been coming. Recent results have been poor, but the former Brentford boss was unhappy with the financial backing he received from owner Dave King - a man who he hasn't spoken to in person, on a one to one basis, for months. For his part, King had grown disillusioned by Warburton's signings and what he perceived to be a lack of progress. It was a relationship well beyond repair. Some will believe Warburton was agitating to get out, others will say the board turned on him. Whatever the truth, it's another mess this club could well do without. Warburton's reign at Ibrox suffered a blow in November, when high-profile summer signing Joey Barton was sacked after a training ground disagreement with team-mate Andy Halliday and the manager following a 5-1 defeat by Celtic. It called into question his signing policy, but Warburton gave another ringing endorsement to McParland, who was with him at Brentford, before Sunday's game. ""I've said time and again - his track record is outstanding,"" he said. ""There would be no shortage of takers for someone of his quality."" Warburton also quoted a former Rangers manager in pointing out the pressures that come with the post. ""Walter Smith said to me that you are never more than two or three games away from a major crisis,"" he said. ""That is life at Rangers. ""That is the nature of it. You just get on with it."" Warburton was in charge of Rangers for 82 games, winning 55, drawing 14 and suffering 13 losses. His 67% win rate was more than Stuart McCall, who took charge at the end of the 2014-15 season, and had a 41% win rate, but less than his predecessor, Ally McCoist, with 72%. BBC Scotland's chief sports writer Tom English Mark Warburton attempted to explain away his team's - or former team's - dreary draw against Ross County by saying a series of random events conspired against his players. It was, he said, football's strange ways that denied them on the day, as if some cosmic force was to blame for the failings rather than his own players and his own management. Warburton's comments were bizarre but nowhere near as surreal as the nonsense that took hold of Rangers on Friday evening as the club said that Warburton was leaving and Warburton said that he wasn't. Rangers have known dysfunction in recent years, but those times are not as distant as some chose to believe. They're just dysfunctional in a different way now. Rudderless, leaking like a sieve and now embarrassed in a way that surely took their supporters back to the dog days of Charles Green and chums. This is a shambles.

"This video can not be played Six Nations 2017: Alun Wyn Jones on what makes Wales v England special Six Nations 2017 on the BBC Dates:4 February-18 MarchFixtures:Available here Coverage:Live across BBC TV, radio and online, with live text commentary and scores from every game on the BBC Sport website and app (full coverage details) Wales welcome England to Cardiff in the Six Nations on Saturday with visiting coach Eddie Jones warning his team to expect all manner of ""shenanigans"" from the hosts. In Saturday's earlier game Ireland travel to Italy determined to bounce back after their opening defeat by Scotland, while on Sunday Vern Cotter's buoyant Scots travel to Paris, where they have not won since 1999. But the undoubted highlight of the weekend is the 130th edition of Wales and England, a fixture that was first played in 1881. This weekend's fixtures Italy v Ireland,Sat 11 Feb, 14:25 GMT - live on BBC Radio 5 live sports extra Wales v England,Sat 11 Feb, 16:50 GMT - live on BBC One, connected TV and online France v Scotland,Sun 12 Feb, 15:00 GMT - live on BBC One, connected TV and online ""You go to the hotel and unless you take steps, players get rung incessantly through the night. Those things happen,"" Jones said. ""You go to the ground and the traffic controller drives slower than the traffic's going to make sure you're late. ""You get to the ground and there's something wrong with your dressing room - there's lights off or the heater's switched off. ""You can't check because they traditionally tell you one thing and something else happens. It happens regularly in South Africa and it happens regularly in Wales."" This video can not be played 'They're a cunning lot, the Welsh': Jones ready for Wales 'shenanigans' Even before Jones aired his concerns the occasion was always likely to be a high-octane affair as, given their long-standing history and neighbourly rivalry, Wales playing England in Cardiff is among the most emotive occasions in world sport. Six Nations week two preview Wales v England is make or break for Howley Follow the Six Nations across the BBC News alerts put you at the centre of the Six Nations The Six Nations heavy artillery ""It's not different water or different air"" - Jones Wales' assistant coach Robin McBryde believes that the fierce rivalry is an inevitable consequence of the shared history and proximity of the two nations. ""We are neighbours, aren't we? I have got two English brothers-in-law,"" he said ""It is that English-Welsh rivalry, and wanting to get the better of your neighbour. It's as simple as that."" England have 60 victories to Wales' 57 in the teams' 129 matches with nine draws. However, Wales have a 60% winning record against England in Cardiff. Jones, whose side have won a national record 15 Tests in a row, has been merrily making mischief since the narrow opening win over France last weekend, suggesting earlier this week that the Welsh are ""a cunning lot"". Saturday's match is the sort of occasion which prompts week-long debates about whether the roof on the Principality Stadium will be open or closed. Wales wanted it closed, to ramp up the noise inside the 72,000-capacity stadium which is renowned for its vertiginous stands and electric atmosphere. England, as the away side, had the final say under Six Nations rules and - having said he was not bothered one way or the other earlier in the week - Jones has opted for it to be left open. While the Australian has been stoking the flames, the hosts have been more circumspect - although Wales defence coach Shaun Edwards was moved to compare Jonesto legendary former Nottingham Forest manager Brian Clough. And despite his barbs the England head coach has not been short of compliments, praising the Principality Stadium's ""amazing atmosphere"". He added: ""How could you not want to play rugby there? ""It is one of the greatest rugby countries in the world, so to play Wales in Cardiff with that sort of atmosphere is one of the great delights of rugby."" Wales have injury worries about winger George North - who is chasing a new record of scoring a try in six championship games in a row - and fly-half Dan Biggar and both will have fitness tests on matchday. This video can not be played Six Nations 2017: Wales' Rob Evans says England is 'just another game' But there is some good news for them, with world class number eight Taulupe Faletau back in action, although he only makes it as far as the bench after injury. England have made two changes from the team that edged past France, with winger Jack Nowell recalled and back rower Jack Clifford handed just his second England start as Jones searches for more ball carrying options. Greig Laidlaw will win his 58th cap in the match against France Scotland have lost nine successive games on French soil since they won36-22 at the Stade de France in 1999,externalon the final weekend of their triumph in the last Five Nations championship. How their forwards match up against a formidably physical French pack could be key to halting that losing run. Scotland flanker Hamish Watson, who weighs in at a relatively lightweight 15st 12lb, says he is confident that he and his team-mates can meet the challenge. ""They are a big pack and will pose us a different threat to Ireland, We know they are going to scrum well and have been concentrating on that,"" he said. ""But it's nothing we can't deal with, so I think it will go well."" France coach Guy Noves believes that counterpart Vern Cotter's work is bearing fruit as he approaches the end of his stint with Scotland. Gregor Townsendwill take over in June. ""We will mainly adapt to the Scottish rugby that you have seen evolve for four years - a game based on commitment, speed, aggression, with players who have gained confidence in a highly organised collective,"" he said. Scotland have made one change with the starting line-up that beat Ireland with John Barclay coming in at blind-side flanker to replace Ryan Wilson, who is out with an elbow infection. Rory Best was successful with all but one of his 12 line-out throws against Scotland Ireland coach Joe Schmidt will make sure his side are at Rome's Stadio Olimpico in plenty of time for the weekend's opening fixture as he feels that their late arrival at Murrayfield last week contributed to their lacklustre start to the match. Ireland, whose team bus turned up about 15 minutes late after its police escort reportedly guided it away from an agreed route, conceded three tries in the first half hour to trail by 16 points. ""I don't think it was apathy, there was a bit of anxiety at not having had the full period to warm up,"" said Schmidt. ""Players get anxious, they get very routine-based and I do think it's a challenge for a professional player that they can be adaptable in different circumstances, so they can still start well and cope."" Schmidt has kept faith with fly-half Paddy Jackson at 10 with Johnny Sexton still returning to fitness after a calf injury picked up playing for Leinster in January. Italy, led by former Ireland international Conor O'Shea, have beaten Ireland four times in 26 meetings,with their latest success coming in 2013.

"Mr Trump's travel ban caused chaos at US airports and sparked protests across the country Donald Trump is considering a new executive order to ban citizens of certain countries from travelling to the US after his initial attempt was overturned in the courts. Mr Trump told reporters on Air Force One that a ""brand new order"" could be issued as early as Monday or Tuesday. It comes after an appeals court in San Francisco upheld a court ruling to suspend his original order. It barred entry from citizens from seven mainly Muslim countries. It is unclear what a new US immigration order might look like. Mr Trump said that it would change ""very little"", but he did not provide details of any new ban under consideration. Despite his suggestion on Friday, Mr Trump's administration may still pursue its case in the courts over the original order, which washalted a week ago by a Seattle judge. ""We'll win that battle,"" Mr Trump told reporters, adding: ""The unfortunate part is it takes time. We'll win that battle. But we also have a lot of other options, including just filing a brand new order."" This video can not be played President Trump speaking on Air Force One: ""We need speed for reasons of security"" An unnamed judge from the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals, which on Thursday upheld the stay on the original order, has called on all 25 judges of that court to vote on whether to hear the appeal again. Technically known as an en banc review, a second hearing of the case would involve an 11-judge panel, rather than the three who initially heard the appeal. Mr Trump's travel ban, which was hastily unveiled at the end of his first week in office, caused chaos at US airports and sparked protests across the country. Read more on this story: Trump border policy: Who's affected? Is Trump's immigration order legal? The Canadian town taking refugees from US Is US heading for constitutional crisis? On Thursday, the appeals court said the administration failed to offer ""any evidence"" to justify the ban, which the president said was necessary to keep the US safe from terror attacks. However Mr Trump insisted that the executive order was crucial for national security and promised to take action ""very rapidly"" to introduce ""additional security"" steps in the wake of the court's decision. He spoke as Virginia state lawyers argued in court that his policy ""resulted from animus toward Muslims"". This video can not be played The US state with a deep fear of refugees Their challenge focuses on the travel restrictions imposed by the ban, rather than the four-month suspension of refugee admissions. But lawyers for the US government in Virginia wrote that ""judicial second-guessing"" amounted to ""an impermissible intrusion"" on Mr Trump's constitutional authority. The appeals court ruling means that visa holders from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen can continue to enter the US, and refugees from around the world, who were also subject to a temporary ban, are no longer blocked either. But the ruling does not affect one part of Mr Trump's controversial executive order: a cap of 50,000 refugees to be admitted in the current fiscal year, down from the ceiling of 110,000 established under his predecessor, Barack Obama.

"Demonstrators spell out ""No Muslim Ban"" at a protest in Boston Federal circuit courts usually toil in anonymity. They are a legal rest stop for landmark cases on the way to the Supreme Court. But this week it was different. All eyes were on three judges of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, who, for a brief moment, had the fate of Donald Trump's immigration order in their hands. They were considering whether to sustain a temporary injunction preventing implementation of Mr Trump's sweeping travel ban on seven predominantly Muslim nations. On Thursday night they gave their ruling. Mr Trump's order stayed on ice. Here are three things we learned from the ruling - and two questions that remain unanswered. 1. The immigration ban is going nowhere fast The Ninth Circuit was the Trump administration's best chance to get the president's immigration order up and running again quickly. The three judges could have re-instated the order and closed the borders as early as Thursday night. Instead, the order remains in limbo and it's likely to take time to resolve. The Supreme Court could hear an appeal, but the chances of more than four justices agreeing to reverse the Ninth Circuit ruling seem slim. Is Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor, Stephen Breyer or Elena Kagan going to side with Mr Trump? Not likely. More on this story Trump loses appeal court bid to reinstate travel ban Banned: An Iraqi family's immigration story Is the US heading for a constitutional crisis? What the Trump team has said about Islam If this goes back down to the district court in Seattle, where it began, the gears of justice will grind even more slowly. A trial on the merits - which is slated to happen next, pending Supreme Court action - is a slow process. Briefs need to be filed. Evidence has to be submitted. Oral arguments will be scheduled. These things can take months or even years. That's a painful lesson Barack Obama learned in 2015, when a district court judge blocked implementation of some of his immigration reforms and the Supreme Court didn't hear the case for more than a year. 2. The case will be no slam-dunk for Trump This may seem obvious now, but on Thursday the president was fairly certain that his case was open-and-shut when he read what he viewed as the governing immigration statute to a gathering of law enforcement officers. ""You can be a lawyer, or you don't have to be a lawyer; if you were a good student in high school or a bad student in high school, you can understand this,"" he said. ""And it's really incredible to me that we have a court case that's going on so long."" This video can not be played Bob Ferguson: Travel ban was adopted with ""little thought, little planning, little oversight"" Some conservatives, as well,wrote,externalthat the governing laws were clear that the president has broad powers when dealing with immigration issues. ""For all except the most partisan, it is likely impossible to read the Washington state lawsuit... and not come away with the conclusion that the Trump order is on sound legal and constitutional ground."" In the end, however, the three justices - two appointed by Democrats and one nominated by Republican George W Bush - saw things differently. While they acknowledged the president's authority on immigration matters, they said the statute Mr Trump cited was not the final word on the matter. ""Although our jurisprudence has long counselled deference to the political branches on matters of immigration and national security, neither the Supreme Court nor our court has ever held that courts lack the authority to review executive action in those arenas for compliance with the Constitution,"" the judges wrote. In other words, federal immigration law may have been on Mr Trump's side, but the Constitution wasn't. 3. The haphazard rollout hurt the order At the heart of the Ninth Circuit's decision to uphold the injunction against Mr Trump's order was that it violated the constitutional due process rights of all persons in the US, regardless of their citizenship or immigration status. And time and time again the judges pointed to how the order was initially implemented as reason for keeping it on hold. They wrote that permanent residents and lawful visa holders were not given ""constitutionally sufficient notice and an opportunity to respond"". While they noted that the Trump administration had since interpreted the order as allowing all permanent residents into the US, they were unconvinced that this new interpretation would be uniformly followed or safe from reversal. This video can not be played How travel ban prompted a heartfelt act of kindness They said that the travel ban caused considerable harm, including the separation of families, stranding of US residents abroad and prevention of students and employees from travelling to American universities. A more measured, orchestrated rollout of the immigration order may have avoided these complications, weakening the case against it. Mr Trump said on Wednesday that speed was necessary in implementing the ban because otherwise a ""whole pile of bad people, perhaps with very evil intentions"" would enter the country before border restrictions tightened. Here, however, haste may have killed his legal case. 1. Is the immigration order anti-Muslim? Shortly after the Ninth Circuit issued its opinion, Nevada Democratic Senator Catherine Cortez Masto released a statement saying that the court ""reaffirms that President Trump's hateful and divisive executive order amounts to religious discrimination against Muslims"". While the decision was certainly a blow for the Trump administration, the judges were notably restrained in discussing the religious issue. ""The states' claims raise serious allegations and present significant constitutional questions,"" the judges wrote. Then they said they wouldn't consider the question further, since they had already decided the case on due process grounds. They did offer one clue as to how they might eventually rule, however. The Trump administration had insisted that the order must be judged on its own, without taking into consideration past remarks made by Mr Trump and his supporters touting a ""Muslim ban"". The judges disagreed. ""It is well established that evidence of purpose beyond the face of the challenged law may be considered in evaluating Establishment and Equal Protection Clause claims."" In other words, when it comes time to consider whether the order amounted to a de facto Muslim ban, everything is on the table - Trump tweets, Rudy Giuliani diatribes and all. 2. What happens next? Now that the Ninth Circuit has rendered its decision, the ball is firmly in the Trump administration's court. They could appeal to the US Supreme Court, where the eight justices - four liberal, four conservative - can consider as much, or as little, of the ruling as they see fit. Mr Trump certainly seemed to hint that this was the next step,tweeting,external: ""SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!"" shortly after the ruling. The administration could also decide to let the circuit court's decision stand and fight out the case in a full trial back in the Seattle district court. This would buy the president time to get his Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, confirmed by the Republican-held Senate. Then, when the case eventually made its way to the high court, his chances of victory could be markedly improved. Whatever happens, it's clear that this case will be a political football.

"Jeremy Corbyn imposed a three-line whip on his MPs in the Brexit vote Labour frontbenchers who defied Jeremy Corbyn in this week's Commons Brexit vote will be sent a formal written warning but will not be sacked. Mr Corbyn had imposed a three-line whip on his MPs to vote to back Brexit. But 52 Labour MPs rebelled in Wednesday's vote, including 11 junior shadow ministers and three whips, whose job it is to impose party discipline. Clive Lewis, who quit the shadow cabinet over the vote, said rumours of a leadership bid by him were ""fantasy"". Mr Corbyn imposed the three-line whip after vowing his party would not seek to obstruct the implementation of the EU referendum result. Convention dictates that members of the leader's shadow cabinet team should resign or be sacked if they defy such an order. Some did resign but the remaining rebels are to receive only a letter insisting that they must comply with the whip in the future. The decision not to sack them leaves Labour facing the prospect of three whips trying to persuade their colleagues to vote with a leader who himself rebelled against Labour more than 400 times - when they have defied him themselves, BBC political correspondent Chris Mason says. Mr Lewis has since been replaced as shadow business secretary by Rebecca Long-Bailey. The churn in Corbyn's shadow cabinet Speaking to the Eastern Daily Press,external, Mr Lewis, who is MP for Norwich, said his resignation was not the beginning of a bid to challenge Mr Corbyn for the party leadership, adding that he was ""working hard"" to support him from the back benches. A string of resignations from the Labour front bench mean there are still a ""couple of vacancies"" to be filled but it is not expected there will be any further announcements until next week. New appointments announced on Friday include Ian Lavery and Andrew Gwynne, who become joint national elections and campaign coordinators. Jon Trickett has become shadow minister for the Cabinet Office and will remain shadow Lord President of the Council. The draft Brexit legislation was approved by 494 votes to 122 in Wednesday's vote and now moves to the House of Lords. Prime Minister Theresa May wants to trigger formal Brexit talks by the end of March. She will do this by invoking Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty but requires Parliament's permission before doing so.

"Hundreds of volunteers joined the rescue effort in one of New Zealand's worst mass beachings Volunteers in New Zealand have managed to refloat about 100 of the 400 pilot whales that swam aground on a remote beach on Friday. Many of the whales died overnight at Farewell Spit at the top of the South Island, but those that survived are now swimming in the bay off the beach. Hundreds of locals managed to rescue the survivors after forming a human chain to refloat the whales. The incident is one of the worst such cases the country has seen. On Friday, a number of the whales that had been refloated returned to the beach overnight, but rescue efforts were helped by the high tide and the arrival of a new pod of pilot whales on Saturday morning. This video can not be played One volunteer said ""people from all over the world"" were helping to try to save the whales ""Fingers crossed, the new whales are going to lead them out into deeper water,"" said Andrew Lamason, the department of conservation's regional manager. However, he added that there was still a chance that they might turn back into Golden Bay. Mr Lamason said improved weather and clear waters also helped with the latest rescue attempt, but added that he had to warn volunteers about the possibility of stingrays and sharks after one of the dead whales appeared to have bite marks. Officials on Saturday were also considering how best to dispose of the whale carcasses. Mr Lamason said that simply towing them out to sea could be problematic as they may become gaseous and buoyant and float into populated bays. Scientists do not know what exactly causes whales to beach themselves. But it sometimes happens because the whales are old and sick, injured, or make navigational errors particularly along gentle sloping beaches. Whales that become beached will send out distress signals attracting other members of their pod, who then also get stranded by a receding tide. Are whales attempting suicide when they strand themselves? Rescuers form a human chain to prevent the surviving whales from returning to the beach The latest incident in New Zealand was first reported on Thursday evening, but conditions were too dangerous at the time to launch a rescue operation. The surviving whales were kept alive after ""being kept cool, calm and comfortable"" by medics and members of the public. New Zealand has one of the highest stranding rates in the world, with about 300 dolphins and whales ending up on beaches every year, according toProject Jonah.,external Many of these incidents happen at Farewell Spit. Experts say its shallow waters seems to confuse whales and hinder their ability to navigate. In February 2015 about 200 whales beached themselves atthe same location,of which at least half died.

"Schoolchildren in England will be offered lessons in cyber security in a bid to find the experts of the future to defend the UK from attacks. It is hoped 5,700 pupils aged 14 and over will spend up to four hours a week on the subject in a five-year pilot. Classroom and online teaching, ""real-world challenges"" and work experience will be made available from September. A Commons committee last week warned that a skills shortage was undermining confidence in the UK's cyber defences. The risk that criminals or foreign powers might hack into critical UK computer systems is now ranked as one of the top four threats to national security. Russia in particular is suspected of planning sustained attacks on Western targets. Cyber security is a fast-growing industry, employing 58,000 experts, the government says, but the Public Accounts Committee has warned it is proving difficult to recruit people with the right skills. UK's cyber security defences questioned Russian hacks 'aim to destabilise the West' The Department for Culture, Media and Sport is providing Â£20m for the lessons, which will be designed to fit around pupils' current courses and exams. Digital and Culture Minister Matt Hancock said: ""This forward-thinking programme will see thousands of the best and brightest young minds given the opportunity to learn cutting-edge cyber security skills alongside their secondary school studies. ""We are determined to prepare Britain for the challenges it faces now and in the future and these extra-curricular clubs will help identify and inspire future talent."" The government is already providing university funding and work placements for promising students. An apprenticeship scheme has also begun to support key employers to train and recruit young people aged 16 or over who have a ""natural flair for problem-solving"" and are ""passionate about technology"". Steve Elder, 20, who is a cyber security apprentice with BT,told BBC Radio 5 Live that educating young peopleabout the risks and vulnerabilities of the cyber security world would help the UK prepare for the future. He added: ""Getting young people involved and getting them taught from a young age will allow them - even in their home environment - to protect themselves, before it has to come to people at a specialist level."" Mr Hancock told the BBC he wanted to ensure the UK ""had the pipeline of talent"" it would need. Cyber security expert Brian Lord, a former deputy director at GCHQ, told BBC Breakfast that the scheme was an ""essential initiative"" to recruit more people into the profession. He added: ""There is perception that cyber security is all about techno geeks who have long hair, glasses, wear heavy metal t-shirts and drink red bull. ""There are those, and they do an extraordinarily good job. But there is a whole range of other activities... that can appeal to a wide cross section of children, graduates and apprentices, and at the moment they don't know what [is on] offer. ""The more exposure [children] can get [the more it will] prepare them for a future career and, as that generation needs to understand how to be safe online, you get a double benefit.""

"The number of executions has fallen nationwide Ohio Governor John Kasich has delayed eight upcoming executions amid a row over the legality of the state's execution process. Earlier this year a magistrate judge declared as unconstitutional a three-drug process the state had proposed, but Ohio is appealing. The judge banned the use of drugs that paralyse inmates and stop their hearts, but lawyers for the state said they were unable to find a willing supplier. One prisoner was set to die next week. Ronald Phillips was scheduled to be executed on 15 February for raping and killing his girlfriend's three-year-old daughter, but that has now been pushed back to 10 May. Is the death penalty dying out in the US? Governor Kasich explained that the legal challenge necessitated the delay, but that he is confident that the state will win the appeal, and resume with the scheduled executions. ""These delays are necessary to allow the judicial process to come to a full resolution, and ensure that the state can move forward with the executions after the appeal is settled,"" Mr Kasich said. The US Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati will hear arguments on 21 February. A lawyer for the state's prison agency said that they had contacted seven states to request supplies of Pentobarbital, but were rejected. A court filing says Ohio had asked Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Missouri, Texas and Virginia for the drug, but they were unwilling to provide it. Ohio is among several states that have had problems securing legal supplies of drugs used in lethal injections. The number of US executions peaked at 98 in 1999 but has been falling ever since. Only 20 were carried out in 2016. The death penalty is a legal punishment in 31 US states Since 1976 Texas has carried out the most executions (540), followed by Oklahoma and Virginia (both 112) In July 2016, there were 2,095 inmates on death row in the US California has the most prisoners on death row, 741, but has carried out only 13 executions since 1976 Source: Death Penalty Information Center,external Judge bars Ohio's lethal injection drugs Keir Starmer and Kemi Badenoch clash over a national inquiry into grooming gangs Thousands flee three LA wildfires as forecasters warn worst is yet to come Inside neighbourhood totally lost in LA fires How Canada's immigration debate soured - and helped seal Trudeau's fate 'I can't get divorced as I can't get my pension valued' BBC Sound of 2025: Barry Can't Swim is a new dance music superstar Ros Atkins on...Elon Musk's political interventions A journalist's murder highlights risks of reporting in small-town India Jean-Marie Le Pen - founder of French far right and 'Devil of the Republic' Cases of HMPV are on the rise in China - but what is it?

"Plans to allow councils to opt out of key legal duties to vulnerable children have been labelled a ""serious danger"" by a former government adviser. Prof Eileen Munro, whose social work review inspired the Children and Social Work Bill, said the opt-outs create ""more dangers than benefits"". Under the bill, children's rights and checks on care could be set aside by councils trying new ways of working. Ministers said it was wrong to say that children would be at risk as a result. Instead they argue the Bill is a bold approach to removing red tape and allowing innovative ways of working. The Bill, which is going through Parliament,has been described as ""a bonfire of child protection rights"",with many campaigners arguing that to allow councils to opt out of these long-standing duties would be risky and unnecessary. If it becomes law, local authorities would be able to apply to the secretary of state to be exempted from one or more legal duties for a period of three years so it could try out new ways of working. This could then be extended for a further three years. Ministers have regularly cited Prof Munro as a supporter of what the government refers to as ""innovation powers"", referring to a statement issued last year in which she supported the plans. However, the professor of social policy has now signalled her opposition to the Bill in an email to children's rights campaign group Article 39. ""I have reached the conclusion that the power to have exemption from primary and secondary legislation creates more dangers than the benefits it might produce,"" she said. ""While I understand and respect the motivation of the current government, there is a serious danger in having such wide-reaching powers in statute. ""Some future secretary of state might use them in ways that are completely contrary to the current intentions and consequently subvert the will of Parliament."" The legal duties affected by the Bill relate to nearly all the social care services children receive from local authorities, which have been laid down in numerous acts of Parliament. These include statutory rights on child protection, family support, children's homes and fostering, support to care leavers and services for disabled children. About 50 organisations publicly oppose the proposed exemptions, including the British Association of Social Workers, the Care Leavers' Association, Women's Aid, Liberty and the National Association of People Abused in Childhood. Article 39 director Carolyne Willow said: ""The death knell has finally sounded for this appalling attack on children's law and parliamentary sovereignty. ""From the start, ministers claimed their dangerous plan to test out the removal of legal protection from vulnerable children and young people had the backing of Prof Munro. Well now she has walked away. ""Peers rejected these clauses, more than 50 organisations oppose them, social workers and others with long careers helping children reject them and more than 107,000 members of the public have signed a petition against them. ""Nobody wants our child protection and welfare system to lose its legal infrastructure. ""Ministers must do the decent thing for children and young people and withdraw these hated clauses."" A Department for Education spokeswoman said: ""We know that over-regulation can get in the way of good social work practice, and the power to innovate will allow local authorities to test new approaches in a carefully controlled and monitored way. ""We have amended these clauses to strengthen the safeguards - to suggest the power to innovate would place children at risk is simply wrong.""

"Parks are seeing playgrounds removed in a spending squeeze, MPs say Public parks are at risk of falling into neglect as funding to maintain them comes under pressure, says a report by a committee of MPs. The squeeze has resulted in reduced opening hours, the removal of play equipment, toilets closing and more litter, vandalism and rats, MPs said. They urged councils to find new ways to fund and manage parks. The Local Government Association said councils have to balance spending on parks against other priorities. The report by the Commons Communities and Local Government (CLG) Committee argued housing demand was also putting parks at risk, with new homes ""nibbling away"" at green spaces in some areas. Unless parks were recognised as ""much more than just grass and tulips"", there was a risk of turning the clock back to an era of neglect of 20 to 30 years ago, the MPs warned. Local authorities have no statutory duty to fund and maintain public parks, and a 2014 report by the Heritage Lottery Fund found 86% of park managers had seen cuts to their budgets since 2010. The UK has about 27,000 public parks attracting 2.6 billion visits a year. The MPs argued that parks play an important role by: Helping to integrate communities Tackling climate change Preventing flooding Reducing air pollution exposure Boosting health Providing leisure amenities Councils should publish strategic plans that recognise parks' wider value and consider a range of alternative models for looking after parks, they said. However, the MPs added, they should remain owned by local authorities and be freely available to everyone. Parks needed recognising as more than just tulips and grass, the MPs said The MPs also entered the debate over the free use of parks by organisations such as Parkrun, which hit the headlineswhen a parish council tried to charge for its weekly runs in a Bristol park last year. Community organisations, such as Parkrun, which do not charge for participation or raise revenue, could be encouraged to contribute volunteer time to help maintain parks or undertake fundraising, the report said. Helen Griffiths, chief executive of Fields in Trust, a charity that seeks better statutory protection for recreational spaces, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that parks can help to get more people active, tackle obesity and address anti-social behaviour. ""I think it is really important that we shouldn't see parks as a drain on our services, not as a budget just for cutting the grass, but as an area that can make a real contribution to tackling some of those very important issues,"" she said. Peter Fleming, deputy chairman of the Local Government Association, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Many councils are saying actually the park is an asset that can help things around public health, but also around how we bring open spaces for families who live in urban areas as well. ""But we have to try and balance that spending against those other priorities that councils have, so it is a difficult thing."" Parkrun UK facts and figures: Parkruns, such as this one in Sheffield joined by Jessica Ennis-Hill, take place across the country â¢Number of events - 78,995 â¢Number of locations - 443 â¢Average run time - 00:27:54 â¢Number of runners - 1,199,064 â¢Total distance run - 69,671,120km. Clive Betts, Labour chairman of the Commons committee, said: ""Parks are treasured public assets, as the overwhelming response to our inquiry demonstrates, but they are at a tipping point and, if we are to prevent a period of decline with potentially severe consequences, then action must be taken."" He said the government had a leadership role to play and volunteers did ""fantastic work"" but the primary responsibility lay with local authorities. The vast majority of councils have cut budgets for parks and were likely to cut further, with Newcastle City Council's parks management budget slashed from Â£2.589m in 2011/12 to Â£0.253m in 2016/17, the report found. The government should help councils find innovative ways of managing public parks and green spaces should also be at the heart of planning, the report added.

"Mark Warburton took Rangers training on Friday Rangers have replaced Mark Warburton as manager with under-20 coach Graeme Murty before Sunday's Scottish Cup tie with Greenock Morton. The Scottish Premiership club say they have accepted the resignations of Warburton, assistant David Weir and head of recruitment, Frank McParland. But Warburton, who took charge in 2015, told BBC Scotland he has not stood down and was unaware of the statement. And the 54-year-old Englishman is consulting his legal team. The BBC has learned that Warburton had contact with Nottingham Forest around 10 days ago and was high on the English Championship club's list of possible managers. However, he was not offered the job and they decided to retain their interim team of Gary Brazil and Jack Lester until the end of the season. Warburton, who had a contract at Ibrox until 2018, had taken Rangers' training on Friday as normal before Sunday's fifth-round tie. He had earlier in the morning defended McParland's record of signings after media criticism of the Glasgow club's recruitment. ""At a meeting with the management team's representative earlier this week, the club were advised that Mr Warburton, Mr Weir and Mr McParland wished to resign their positions and leave the club on condition that Rangers agreed to waive its rights to substantial compensation,"" said Rangers' statement. Who is Graeme Murty? Although born in England, Graeme Murty qualified to play for Scotland and won four caps between 2004 and 2007 The 42-year-old played for York, Reading, Charlton Athletic and Southampton in a career lasting 17 years and 437 games He won the Football League Championship with Reading in 2005/06. He has coached at Southampton and Norwich City, both at youth level Joined Rangers in August 2016 as head development squad coach ""Rangers' agreement to waive compensation would assist the management team to join another club. ""This compensation amount was agreed when Rangers significantly improved Mr Warburton and Mr Weir's financial arrangements before the start of this season. ""The board urgently convened to consider the offer made on behalf of the management team and its ramifications and agreed to accept it and release the trio from the burden of compensation, despite the potential financial cost to the club."" Rangers claim that Warburton's representative attempted to alter the the terms. ""A further board meeting was held this afternoon to discuss this and it was decided not to agree to this additional request but to hold with the original agreement,"" he said. ""Mr Warburton, Mr Weir, and Mr McParland have therefore been notified in writing that their notices of termination have been accepted."" Warburton led Rangers to the Championship title and promotion last season Rangers lie third in the Scottish top flight, but they are a distant 27 points behind city rivals and reigning champions Celtic and their statement went on to suggest that the management team have not reached the targets set. ""The board is very appreciative of the good work previously done by the management team but believes it had no alternative,"" it added. ""Our club must come first and absolute commitment is essential. ""It is important that Rangers has a football management team that wants to be at the club and that the board believes can take the club forward to meet our stated ambition to return to being the number one club in Scotland. ""We are clearly short of where we expected to be at this time."" Analysis: Chris McLaughlin, BBC Scotland senior football reporter Relations between Mark Warburton and the Rangers board have been strained for some time. The manner of the departure could never have been predicted, but the departure itself had been coming. Recent results have been poor, but the former Brentford boss was unhappy with the financial backing he received from owner Dave King - a man who he hasn't spoken to in person, on a one to one basis, for months. For his part, King had grown disillusioned by Warburton's signings and what he perceived to be a lack of progress. It was a relationship well beyond repair. Some will believe Warburton was agitating to get out, others will say the board turned on him. Whatever the truth, it's another mess this club could well do without. Warburton's reign at Ibrox suffered a blow in November, when high-profile summer signing Joey Barton was sacked after a training ground disagreement with team-mate Andy Halliday and the manager following a 5-1 defeat by Celtic. It called into question his signing policy, but Warburton gave another ringing endorsement to McParland, who was with him at Brentford, before Sunday's game. ""I've said time and again - his track record is outstanding,"" he said. ""There would be no shortage of takers for someone of his quality."" Warburton also quoted a former Rangers manager in pointing out the pressures that come with the post. ""Walter Smith said to me that you are never more than two or three games away from a major crisis,"" he said. ""That is life at Rangers. ""That is the nature of it. You just get on with it."" Warburton was in charge of Rangers for 82 games, winning 55, drawing 14 and suffering 13 losses. His 67% win rate was more than Stuart McCall, who took charge at the end of the 2014-15 season, and had a 41% win rate, but less than his predecessor, Ally McCoist, with 72%. BBC Scotland's chief sports writer Tom English Mark Warburton attempted to explain away his team's - or former team's - dreary draw against Ross County by saying a series of random events conspired against his players. It was, he said, football's strange ways that denied them on the day, as if some cosmic force was to blame for the failings rather than his own players and his own management. Warburton's comments were bizarre but nowhere near as surreal as the nonsense that took hold of Rangers on Friday evening as the club said that Warburton was leaving and Warburton said that he wasn't. Rangers have known dysfunction in recent years, but those times are not as distant as some chose to believe. They're just dysfunctional in a different way now. Rudderless, leaking like a sieve and now embarrassed in a way that surely took their supporters back to the dog days of Charles Green and chums. This is a shambles.

"The model sparked an online debate after saying ""it has become so normal to hide"" breastfeeding Model Tamara Ecclestone has accused ""bitter people"" of ""hatred"" for disapproving of her posting a photograph of herself breastfeeding her daughter, who is almost three. It has reignited debate over how long - and how publicly - mothers should breastfeed. Ecclestone, 32, first posted the photo of herself nursing two-year-old Sophia on Instagram on Wednesday. The model told people to ""toss"" out the idea that nursing must be kept private. But some followers criticised the post, prompting her to publish another image and lengthy rebuke a day later. In heroriginal picture,external, Ecclestone described breastfeeding as a ""powerful demonstration of love and nurturing - yet it has become so normal to hide"". Some people questioned whether it is appropriate to promote breastfeeding in such a public way - especially for a child who is almost three. ""People shouldn't be plastering picture of children all over social media so everyone can see them,"" said one Instagram user, little_tiddlers. Another person disagreed with nursing a toddler: ""For babies yes it's beautiful but for two years old it's disgusting."" Ecclestone said it was a ""very sad and surprising sign of the times"" that the image had prompted negative comments, after uploading a second breastfeeding picture. Inpost,externalof more than 200 words, she said: ""I support and empower all mums and I personally believe hatred is so heavy and bad for the soul."" Some mothers defended the photos, which were taken by Ivette Ivens, a Lithuanian photographer who often photographs pregnant and nursing women. Another mother, Leanne Caffyn, said: ""I breastfed my daughter until she was four. I have never understood how people think it is strange."" Helen Tomlinson said: ""I love this. I only managed to breastfeed my baby for a month as I felt very uncomfortable in public and even in front of my family."" She said she has now ""pushed through the awkwardness"". Ecclestone said she was ""astonished"" that people thought her picture was in some way a criticism of mothers who bottle fed instead of nursing. ""I would never ask someone when they will take away their toddlers' bottle,"" she said. But Dr Ellie Lee, director of the University of Kent's Centre for Parenting Studies, was not so surprised. ""Breastfeeding has got so moralised and politicised,"" she said. ""The discussion has got out of control - it's just milk."" Women in the UK are advised to begin breastfeeding within an hour of their baby being born and then exclusively for six months. As a result, many women feel like ""total failures"" the first time they gave their baby a bottle of formula, Dr Lee said. ""Parents shouldn't feel like it's a terrible mistake if they breastfeed or don't breastfeed,"" she said. ""Maybe the mother finds nursing difficult, or the father might want to be involved in feeding."" Ecclestone said some people were ""angry"" at her parenting decision to breastfeed a two-year-old. But when should women stop breastfeeding? The World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends continued breastfeeding, along with other sources of nutrition, for two years or more. But British women are ""voting with their feet"" by stopping nursing much earlier, said Dr Lee. Just 1% to 2% of women exclusively feed their baby with breast milk up to the age of six months, the NHS' 2010Infant Feeding Survey,externalhas found. ""Why be sniffy about doing a bit of both, if so many women are choosing to mix feed or use a bottle?"" she asked. Anna Burbidge from La Leche League GB, a breastfeeding education charity, also argued that there should be no fixed end-point. ""Just as babies walk, talk and come out of nappies at different ages, they will also have different breastfeeding needs,"" she said. At the same time, there is no evidence to suggest that breastfeeding a child beyond infancy is harmful, she said. ""Ideally breastfeeding will continue until both mother and child are ready to stop,"" Ms Burbidge added. Ecclestone also accused her critics of ""trying to sexualise breastfeeding"" by deeming her photo inappropriate. But women in the UK are entitled to breastfeed in public and in their place of work under theEquality Act,external. Scotland has additional protection for mothers, with alaw,externalmaking it an offence to try to stop a mother feeding a child up to the age of two. It remains a taboo subject, with some businesses ignoring the law by telling nursing mothers to""cover up"" in pubs, restaurants orshops. The online reaction to Ecclestone's post is another sign that ""society is failing to support many mothers"" who want to nurse openly, said Dr Wendy Jones, author of Breastfeeding for Dads and Grandmas. ""The photographs speak of a baby being loved and nurtured by her mother,"" she said. ""But in so many areas of social media it seems okay to criticise other people."" Zoe Frangou was in Mothercare when her three-month-old baby woke up hungry Sue Ashmore, a director of Unicef's UK Baby Friendly Initiative, suggests that mothers of newborns are ""set up to fail"". Ms Ashmore said official advice that ""breast is best"" is unhelpful when women who want to nurse feel unable to do so openly. ""It's a lethal combination,"" she said. ""It makes them feel really guilty about it."" We would like to hear what you think about breastfeeding. Is nursing a toddler acceptable? And what about your experiences of breastfeeding in public?

"Christian Matlock grew up in Brechin in Angus but is now a bounty hunter in Virginia Christian Matlock is a bounty hunter who spends his days and nights tracking down fugitives who have skipped bail in the US state of Virginia. With his dark sunglasses, his gun and his tattoos, he looks every inch the movie stereotype of the maverick American law enforcement officer, but until seven years ago Christian lived in Brechin. He swapped the east coast of Scotland for the eastern seaboard of the US when he was 21. He worked briefly as a bouncer in Washington DC before obtaining a licence as a bail enforcement agent, often referred to as bounty hunters. They are contracted by bondsmen, money lenders who offer to cover bail money for those who can't afford it in exchange for a 10% commission. Scotland tattooed across Christian's fingers If the accused fails to show in court the bondsman loses the entire sum unless a bounty hunter can track down the fugitive. In Virginia, like most US states, it is not only police who get to carry guns and chase criminals. Christian says: ""Every boy, every man wants to have the gun and go kicking in doors. ""It's exciting being like that but I prefer being the undercover detective kind of guy."" He says he is not a typical bounty hunter and has a low opinion of some others who seem to delight in the macho violence of the job. Christian moved to the US seven years ago to track down his American father. He had been getting into a lot of trouble at home and could not get a job. ""Plus I thought Americans always looked a lot cooler in movies so I thought I'd give it a try,"" he says. In the BBC documentary - The Scottish Bounty Hunter- Christian tells how he felt the need to escape his home town because he was taking ""a lot of ecstasy"" during ""week-long parties"". ""There was bugger all else to do,"" he says. ""I feel like in Scotland I was supposed to die there."" His mother tells the programme she is pleased he left. She says: ""They were getting into trouble with the police and drinking and hanging around with the wrong people. ""Brechin doesn't have anything going for it really. There's not a lot of work in the area. It's like some place to sleep now. ""There's no potential here for young people."" Christian sees similar problems in Virginia. About 80% of the jobs he gets as a bounty hunter are drugs related. He says he wants to help offenders and their families get back to a normal life but he gets paid for finding and putting people back in jail. He says: ""I can't feel sorry for anyone or I'd just end up taking handcuffs off everybody. ""I've thought about taking them off many times and letting folk go but I can't do that. This is what I signed up for."" Christian can use lots of different methods to track people down but his first port of call is Facebook, which can give him clues to where people like to go and who they might be with. He says he caught a woman in Maryland because she used Facebook ""check in"". Christian says he knew she was going to a beauty school but didn't know which one. ""She would 'check in' at this coffee shop every single morning,"" he says. ""Every morning she was there at the same time 'Getting coffee on my way to school' - on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. ""On the Thursday - no check in. Because I checked her into Winchester jail."" As well as getting paid to put people in jail, Christian makes money getting people out. Four years ago he started lending bail money as a bondsman himself. In an average week he'll track down five or six people and bail even more out of jail. He says the job is stressful, dangerous and exhausting. ""Bounty hunters don't last very long,"" he says. ""I only know of three or four who have been in it as long as I have. ""They either can't handle the hours or can't handle the stress."" But Christian says he keeps doing it because it is a chance to help people turn their life around. He says: ""I've got a lot of relationships with people who might end up going off the rails if I left. ""This is a job you can't do half-arsed. ""You are either going to be a bounty hunter full time or you are not going to be one at all. ""I've tried to get out of it two or three times but I just can't seem to stop doing it.""

"Over the next month, elections will be held in five Indian states, but all eyes are on Uttar Pradesh As the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh begins a seven-phase election later this week to choose a new government, the BBC's Geeta Pandey in Delhi explains why these polls matter. Over the next month, elections will be held in five Indian states, but all eyes are on the key battleground of Uttar Pradesh. Commonly known by its initials UP, the state is India's most populous, with an estimated 240 million people. If it were a separate country, UP would be the fifth-largest by population in the world, after China, India, the United States and Indonesia - and larger than Pakistan or Brazil. The state sends the largest number of MPs - 80 - to India's parliament and it is often said that the party that wins the state ends up ruling the country. Several prime ministers, including India's first PM Jawaharlal Nehru, have come from here. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is from the western state of Gujarat, also chose to make his parliamentary debut from the state in the 2014 general election when he stood in Varanasi. In 2019, he was re-elected from there. And voters in the state can easily claim the credit for his Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) sweep of the last two general elections - in 2014, the party won 71 seats here; in 2019, it got 62. Since the late 1990s, state politics have been dominated by the regional Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP). As the two alternated in power, the Congress and the BJP were pushed to the margins. But in 2017, the BJP won a thumping majority, winning 312 of the 403 state assembly seats and nearly 40% of the popular vote, riding on the popularity and charisma of PM Modi. The party chose Yogi Adityanath, a highly polarising saffron-robed Hindu monk-turned politician known for his divisive views, as the chief minister and he is hoping for an encore when the votes are counted on 10 March. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's BJP won a thumping majority in the state in 2017 Lending him a helping hand is Mr Modi who has made nearly a dozen trips to the state in recent months, addressing gatherings and exhorting voters to give the BJP another chance. In the past year though, the party has lost a lot of ground over contentious farm laws - which the government scrapped after a year of protests by farmers - and the state government's disastrous handling of the Covid-19 pandemic last year. Hundreds of bodies, believed to be of people who lost their lives to coronavirus, turned up in the Ganges river. India's holiest river is swollen with bodies Anger rises as Covid rages in Modi's constituency And although the government has been appreciated for providing free rations during the pandemic, there's discontent over a lack of jobs among young people and runaway inflation. At election rallies though, Mr Adityanath, 49, has been claiming to have created plenty of jobs, boosted the economy and improved law and order in the state. He's also been using anti-Muslim rhetoric to win Hindu votes. Mr Adityanath's main challenger is the Samajwadi Party led by 48-year-old Akhilesh Yadav, a former chief minister ousted by the BJP in 2017. Mr Yadav has been working hard to wrest power from the BJP, and he's promised free electricity to all households, pensions for  poor women and interest-free loans to farmers if he's voted into power. His chances have brightened after he stitched up alliances with a number of smaller regional parties. The BSP, led by Dalit (formerly Untouchables) icon Ms Mayawati, is also seeking a comeback but not many are willing to bet on her. The four-time state chief minister, who lost power in 2012, is popular among her community, but during her earlier stints she was criticised for spending millions of dollars to build statues of herself and other Dalit icons. Out of power now for a decade, she has been pushed to the sidelines and has maintained a low profile this election season. The BJP's main challenger is Akhilesh Yadav who leads the Samajwadi Party A host of smaller parties are also in the fray and so is the Congress, India's main opposition party. Led by Priyanka Gandhi, the Congress has grabbed attention with her energetic campaign. She has made news by visiting families of rape victims and police atrocities; and her focus on female voters has made headlines. Even as her personal stock remains high, her campaign is hobbled by a lack of support on the ground. 'Wherever you look, you see ambulances and bodies' India's Priyanka Gandhi demands justice for farmers Because of its sheer size and numbers, Uttar Pradesh  is a crucial battleground. And for the parties in the fray, these elections are being seen as a do-or-die battle. No party has won a second term here since 1989, so the BJP and Mr Adityanath will be keen to break that jinx. The election result will also be seen as a referendum on his politics of Hindu nationalism. For Mr Modi too, the elections are significant as UP is seen as a test run before the 2024 general elections and if the BJP loses here, it will be seen as a sign that the pull of the party and the prime minister are on the decline. A victory for Akhilesh Yadav is crucial as another term out of power is likely to weaken his position as the leader of his party. A loss will also likely put an end to the alliances he's forged with smaller regional groups. A win is also absolutely essential for Ms Mayawati, who has spent the past 10 years in the political wilderness. Analysts say if she loses this time too, she may never be able to bounce back. The Congress, analysts say, is not really playing for a win this time, but is hoping that all the hard work put in by Priyanka Gandhi will help revive the party and help it build for a substantial role in the future. The Congress' Priyanka Gandhi has grabbed the eyeballs with her energetic campaign With 403 seats up for grabs, thousands of contestants are in the fray, fighting for a share of the pie. More than 150 million voters will be casting their votes at 174,351 polling centres, during the seven phases of voting spread over a month. Thousands of police and paramilitary troops are being deployed to ensure the elections are free and fair. But despite its political significance, UP remains one of India's least developed states and home to the largest numbers of poor people in the country. According to the recently-released first-ever multidimensional poverty index, 37.79% of the state's population lives in poverty, more than 44% are deprived of nutrition and millions still have no access to toilets. For the voters, the only way to express themselves is through their vote. And during elections they come out in large numbers to use it - often against those in power. 10 February: 58 seats 14 February: 55 seats 20  February: 59 seats 23 February: 59 seats 27 February: 61 seats 3 March: 57 seats 7 March: 54 seats Vote counting: 10 March This video can not be played Modi's India: Is Modi failing the jobless?

"Around the UK, trusts are coming up with innovative ways of relieving the pressure on the NHS and improving people's health - in hospitals, in GP surgeries, in care homes and in accident and emergency units. In May last year, the A&E department at Queen's Hospital, Romford, started a six-week trial to divert patients away from the department. Patients that attended A&E would be seen as soon as they walked into the department by either a consultant or a GP. ""The doctors would review them, and if appropriate they would redirect them to a more appropriate setting,"" says Sarah Tedford, chief operating officer at Barking, Havering and Redbridge University Hospitals NHS Trust. ""For a lot of patients that actually meant self care - so these were patients who, with the right reassurance, could actually manage the condition themselves."" Alternatively, patients would be redirected to a pharmacist or to their GP so they could get an appointment for a later date. The trial worked so well that it has been adopted full time. They currently divert between 60 and 90 patients a day. ""Most of them can be seen and assessed within five minutes,"" instead of potentially waiting for hours, Sarah Tedford says. She says the staff and most patients have taken to it ""very well"" and they have have been asked to go and talk to other hospitals about it. ""It's just really important to stress it's about directing patients to the most appropriate setting rather than waiting in a busy emergency department where they don't actually need to be,"" she says. ""It's about reassuring the public - it's not turning away sick patients, that's absolutely not what it's about."" In Glasgow, older patients have been helped to leave hospital thanks to a programme that opened 90 beds in private nursing homes. Discharge policies were changed so that patients could leave hospital within 72 hours, and their long-term needs could be assessed outside hospital, rather than lying in a hospital bed. The intermediate care programme, as it is called, was set up in 2014 by Glasgow City Council and NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde. David Williams, the chief officer for Glasgow City Health and Social Care Partnership, says they asked the care home providers to work with them to ""look at re-enablement and rehabilitating"" the people placed in the homes. ""We set targets to get 30% of people home that came into intermediate care beds, and we have achieved that consistently,"" he says. Beforehand, those people would probably have ended up going into residential nursing care for the rest of their days, he adds. Now, moving patients out of hospital beds more quickly has helped the system to flow. Last week, figures showed there were only 24 patients aged over 65 who had been delayed leaving hospital. That compares with 140 people in 2014. Dr King Sun Leong, a diabetes consultant, sees patients before their health deteriorates In the Wirral, a community diabetes clinic is reaching patients who can't travel or don't want to come to hospital. These are the people that Dr King Sun Leong, a consultant in diabetes, worries about. He set up the clinic in November 2015, because he wanted to get access to patients earlier to try to stop type-2 diabetes from taking hold, which can lead to heart attacks, strokes and other health issues. Working with a GP and a specialist nurse, Dr Leong monitors patients' diets and lifestyle, talks to them about their work and their social life and how they lead their lives. He also gives them advice and treatment with the aim of preventing future complications. ""If you've got a little hole in your roof, you want to stop it turning into a big hole,"" Dr Leong says, explaining why it's crucial to see patients early on in the community. And they've had good results. With two community diabetes clinics now in the Wirral, more nurses are being trained to deal with the care of type-2 diabetes and more people are being helped to avoid long-term health problems. Patients visiting GPs in Rotherham are not just offered the normal array of drugs and treatment - they are given the option of exercise clubs, arts groups, metal work clubs and yoga. The concept - known as social prescribing - is based on evidence that shows about a fifth of patients visiting GPs have a social rather than medical problem. The scheme - run by Voluntary Action, a partnership of more than 20 organisations - was launched in 2012. Now, every GP practice is using it and more than 2,000 patients have benefited. GPs and social workers refer those who they believe would benefit to one of five social-prescribing workers. They visit the patient in their home to carry out an assessment and work out what prescription to offer them. It certainly seems to be working. An evaluation has found A&E visits have dropped by a fifth among those who have had a social prescription. The council and local NHS has started working together in the London borough of Sutton to keep care home residents well. GPs have been employed to carry out regular visits of care homes, with each resident now receiving six-monthly check-ups. A pharmacist is on hand to visit homes to carry out medicine reviews. And district nurses have been used to train care home staff in dementia, falls and diabetes. It certainly seems to be working. Since the project started in 2015, there has been a 10% drop in visits to A&E. But help is also on hand when care home residents need to go into hospital. It's a relatively simple concept. When a care home resident needs to go into a hospital, a red bag is packed for them. It contains their details, vital information about their health conditions, supplies of medicine, and even a change of clothes for when they are ready to be discharged - after cases where hospitals had to borrow clothes from lost property when patients had been ready for discharge. The initiative also sees a member of the care home staff visiting the patient in hospital within 48 hours of admission. And this all helps doctors and nurses treat them more effectively. The result is older people are spending less time in hospital - eight days, which is four fewer than before the scheme was set up.

"HTC Vive has been outselling the Oculus Rift I first tried the Oculus Rift virtual reality headset in the corner of a drab conference room in Las Vegas. I was convinced within seconds - despite feeling a little dizzy - that the device, held together by duct tape and hope, was destined for big things. A year or so later, I met the same company, Oculus VR, in a (slightly) fancier room at the E3 gaming event in Los Angeles. ""Hold this,"" I said, abruptly thrusting an audio cable into the hands of a young man who I thought was helping out - but was in fact the company's chief executive, Palmer Luckey. Again, I was blown away by the technology. The next time I'd meet Luckey he'd be many, many millions of dollars richer, and Oculus would be a Facebook-owned company. But despite that very real marker of success, our topic of conversation each time we met remained the same: How are you going to convince people it's worth it? And isn't it going to be way too expensive? ""It isn't,"" he saidthe last time I asked him- but he's wrong. At around $600 (plus a powerful PC) to get started, it is too expensive. But money isn't the problem. The price of the technology will come down, and I'm still convinced virtual reality can be a success - but will it be Facebook's success? The company's strategy in this blossoming market is under question. Best Buy retreat This week we learned that demo stations set up in Best Buy - the huge US technology retail chain -are being rolled back due to poor foot traffic,external. Facebook has described the move as a ""seasonal"" change, but suffice it to say, if they were shifting units they'd still be there. Instead, 200 of the 500 stations across the US are being shut down. It's a potentially troubling moment for the company. Those who back virtual reality - myself included - always subscribed to the view that the key to selling them would be to get people to try it out. Once you've been in VR, we all assumed, you'd be hooked, and your wallet would follow soon after. Google's Daydream VR system could be a threat to Facebook's budget VR success But that doesn't seem to have been the case. For whatever reason, too few people were bothering to even try the demo, let alone buy the product. There are a few theories for this, but the most likely, in my mind, was suggested by NPR's Molly Wood. The problem, she observed recently, might be the ""pink-eye factorâ. She said,external: ""It could be as simple as - and I have said this a million times - not wanting to go into a store and put something on your face that has been on a bunch of other people's faces."" But that wouldn't explain why the Oculus Rift is apparently performing poorly against its closest rival. At the high-end of the virtual reality market, Oculus is up against HTC's Vive, an extremely capable device which has the involvement of Valve, the revered games publisher. Good enough Unofficial data (which I'm using as the companies themselves haven't shared sales figures with us) suggest that the Vive, despite being more expensive, is trouncing Oculus. Games research firm SuperData estimated that 420,000 Vive headsets were sold in 2016, compared to 250,000 sales for the Oculus Rift. The lower end of the market is far more positive for Facebook. The Samsung Gear VR runs the Oculus VR experience, and that is by far and away the most popular device for VR on the market today, according to SuperData. But the hardware is all Samsung's and, for the most part, the headset itself (a simple plastic frame with lenses) has beengiven awaywith many smartphones. The hope that the Gear VR might act as a kind of gateway drug into pricier VR experiences has yet to come to fruition. Or maybe it has, just not for Oculus: the middle ground in VR is Sony's PlayStation VR, $399 and works with the PlayStation 4. It's more powerful than the Gear VR, but less powerful than the high-end headsets. But here's where Facebook should be worried - it seems to be good enough for most gamers. And it's ""good enough"" that makes Facebook's strategy all the more precarious. Who is the Oculus Rift for, exactly? Super serious gamers are gravitating to the HTC Vive. Moderately serious gamers are happy with PlayStation VR. And at the budget end, the Gear VR, while popular now, faces a clear and present threat from Daydream, Google's new VR ecosystem which is far more open. While Gear VR insists you have a Samsung smartphone, Daydream is designed to eventually work with any sufficiently powerful Android device (and it wouldn't be too tricky to make it work with Apple's iOS, either). This compatibility comes at a price, mind - the Daydream View headset is far less comfortable, in my experience, than the Gear VR. But it's comfortable enough, and the little handheld controller provides a far more intuitive way of navigating the VR world than tapping blindly at the side of your head, a la Gear VR. Here comes Hugo So what are the next steps if Facebook is to get on top of this? I'd ask Palmer Luckey, but he's hard to reach at the moment - hidden away from public view after controversy surrounding his support of Donald Trump which involvedfunding a hateful trolling group,external. He still works at the company, but Facebook and Oculus have repeatedly refused to tell me what his job actually is. (Palmer, if you're reading... my Twitter direct messages are open!) The only public appearance he has made since that debacle has been to turn up in court where Facebook (unsuccessfully) defended against claims Oculus illegally used intellectual property belonging to games publisher Zenimax in the early days. A $500m bill for damages awaits,unless Facebook can win on appeal. Mark Zuckerberg has brought on ex-Google executive Hugo Barra In a recent earnings call, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, who is still incredibly enthusiastic about VR and what it means for his network's future, called for patience from his investors. ""It's not going to be really profitable for a while,"" he said. He's never claimed otherwise, it has to be said. VR appears on Facebook's 10-year strategy, a slow burner with potentially big rewards. But falling behind now would be a serious blow, which is why Zuckerberg has brought in Hugo Barra, a man most recently at Chinese firm Xiaomi, but before that, a major name at Google. He'll be in charge of Facebook's efforts in virtual reality from here on in. In Barra, Oculus gains both a visionary and a safe pair of hands. He  having worked on Android, today's most popular smartphone platform. At Xiaomi, his role was to help the company expand globally - and while the company didn't, as some had expected, break into the US under Barra's watch, it did cement a reputation as making good quality devices. He hasn't started his new role at Facebook just yet - he'll be at the company in a month or so, apparently excited to be back in California after a few years away. When he starts his first day - I feel those two questions I've been asking Palmer Luckey still stand: Isn't it still too expensive? And more importantly - how are you going to convince people it's worth it?

"The NHS faces unrelenting pressure despite funding rising. Why? The sheer scale of the NHS can take the breath away. Every 24 hours it sees one million patients, and with 1.7 million staff it's the fifth biggest employer in the world. This vast enterprise absorbs eye-watering amounts of money. Last year Â£140bn was spent on health across the UK - more than 10 times the figure that was ploughed in 60 years ago. And that's after you adjust it for inflation. Governments over the years have had to invest more and more of the public purse into it. Today 30p out of every Â£1 spent on services goes on health. Even during the years of deep austerity, extra money has been found for the health service - Â£8bn more this Parliament in England alone. Yet it seems no matter how much is invested, it's still not enough. The NHS is creaking at the seams. The best barometer of this is the four-hour A&E target. We often think of it as an indication of how good an emergency department is. But it's not. It doesn't tell you about the quality of care - how quickly you get pain relief or whether the unit is good at spotting the signs of a heart attack. Instead it's a sign of whether the system is under stress - both in the community and in the hospital. Which local services are under threat? Upfront charges for foreign patients When there's perfect harmony between the numbers arriving and leaving 95% of patients will be dealt with in four hours. But this isn't happening. You have to go back to the summer of 2015 for the last time it was met in England, with performance deteriorating markedly year on year. The rest of the UK is not immune either. Four-hour performance is worse in Wales and Northern Ireland. Scotland is performing a little better, but is still some way short of the target - its major hospitals have been hovering around the 90% mark in recent weeks. The ageing population is certainly a major factor - and it's one that all health systems in the world are struggling with. Medical advances have meant that people are living longer. When the NHS was created, life expectancy was 13 years shorter than it is now. This is something to celebrate. Infectious diseases are no longer a significant threat. Heart attacks do not claim the lives of people early in the same numbers. Even cancer is not the death sentence it once was - half of people now survive for a decade or more. But this progress has come at a cost. People are living with a growing number of long-term chronic conditions - diabetes, heart disease and dementia. These are more about care than cure - what patients usually need is support. By the age of 65, most people will have at least one of these illnesses. By 75 they will have two. The average 65-year-old costs the NHS 2.5 times more than the average 30-year-old. An 85-year-old costs more than five times as much. As the numbers continue to rise so does the cost to the NHS. This is compounded by the rising cost of new drugs. The health service is currently considering capping the amount it will pay for new drugs at Â£20m each a year. A fifth of new treatments coming on stream cost more than this. Then there's obesity. A third of adults are so overweight they are risking their health significantly. All this contributes to what health economists call health inflation - the idea that the cost of providing care outstrips the normal rise in the cost of living across the economy. This is why health has tended to get more generous rises than other areas of government spending. Over the years this has been achievable through a combination of economic growth, which brings in more money through tax, and reducing spending in areas such as defence, which has led to the NHS taking an ever-greater share of the public purse. But, of course, the economy goes through cycles and over the years governments have varied the amount they were willing or able to give. Since the NHS was created in 1948, the average annual rise has been just over 4%. During the Labour years under Blair and Brown this was closer to 7%. As you can see the period since 2010 has seen the tightest financial settlements. What is more, the spending squeeze is continuing during this Parliament at almost exactly the same rate, even with England's extra Â£8bn going in. Ministers in England are right to say they are increasing funding - it's been frozen in Wales and Scotland - but it's just that it doesn't compare favourably with what the NHS has traditionally got. Indeed, the Institute for Fiscal Studies believes over the 10 years to 2020, the NHS budget across the UK will not have increased enough to keep pace with the ageing and growing population. But is it just a matter of more money? Would an extra few billion make all the problems go away? If you look at other European nations the UK is certainly spending less as a proportion of GDP, which is a measure of the size of the economy. The result, as you would expect, is fewer beds, doctors and nurses per patient in the UK than the big spenders. But a number of these countries achieve that by taxing more. Would the UK public stomach that? If a poll by Ipsos MORI for the BBC this week is anything to go by, they are pretty split - 40% would back a rise in income tax and 53% would support National Insurance going up. Nor does it seem there's appetite for a change in the system. A majority were against charging for services or moving to an insurance-based model like some of our European neighbours do. But even if more money was spent or raised, that would not lead to an overnight improvement. More doctors and nurses would need training and that takes time and, crucially, there is not a flood of people wanting to work in key posts. Trainee posts for GPs are being increased, but the NHS cannot fill them all. There also remain big questions over whether the structure of the NHS is right for 21st Century healthcare. The NHS is still centred on the network of district general hospitals that emerged during the hospital building boom of the 1960s. But in an era where people are struggling with those chronic illnesses, what they really need is support in the community. The problem is there's a serious shortage of this. The number of district nurses in England has been cut by 28% in the past five years, while getting a GP appointment is becoming increasingly difficult. The result is that people end up going to hospital. The numbers visiting A&E have risen by a third in 12 years. Not all of this is down to people with these chronic conditions, but they tend to be the cases that take the most care. Two-thirds of hospitals beds are occupied by the one-third of the population with a long-term condition. There are attempts to change this. To place more emphasis on care outside hospital. NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens has set out a five-year plan to create more integrated care, which involves hospital services working more closely with their local community teams. Similar moves are being made in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. There also an emphasis on prevention - getting people to be more active, eat better diets and drink less. But perhaps the biggest problem is council-run social care. This encompasses day centres, help in the home for tasks such as washing and dressing, and good quality care in care homes during the final years of life. It is seen as essential to keep people well and living independently - and out of hospital. In an era when the population is ageing you would expect more people to be getting help from the state. However, the opposite is true. In England over the past four years, the number of older people getting help has fallen by a quarter. The result is large numbers going without care or having to pay for it themselves. The other parts of the UK can make a case for being more generous in this respect - home care is capped at Â£60 a week in Wales and free for the over-75s in Northern Ireland, while Scotland provides free personal care (washing and dressing) in both care homes and people's own homes. But none of them has cracked it. Indeed, if you were setting up a health and care service today, ask yourself this - how would it be done? Would you separate medical care from personal care? Give one service to a national institution and the other to local councils?  Would you provide one free at the point of need and charge for the other? Would you increase the budget of one, but cut the other? Would you build more than 200 hospitals and spend over half of your budget on them when the biggest users of care are people with long-term illnesses that need care rather than medical intervention? But as that is the system we have got at a time when money is limited, we are falling back on a typical British trait - making do.

"NHS staff have been telling Newsbeat why they love their jobs and why they are optimistic about the future of the health service. ""The general consensus is that we are in a massive crisis at the moment,"" says Emily, a 23-year-old medical student who is training to be a doctor. But nurses and trainee doctors we spoke to say it still feels ""worth it"". One student nurse described the ""amazing moment"" a patient she'd cared for came out of a coma. ""One of the most frustrating things about working for the NHS is when you become the face of the NHS to the patient,"" says Grace, a student nurse from Southampton. ""You may be dealing with a situation that is completely beyond your control but you're on the frontline so as far as the patient is aware, you're the one to blame."" She says it's ""hard to focus on your own learning"" when all around you there is a sense of pressure. ""But there are also times where you started treating someone, they're really critically ill, then two months later you watch them walk out of hospital."" ""I've treated a patient before who was in a coma for a couple of weeks and I was on shift when we decided to wake them up. ""It was the most amazing thing to see their eyes open for the first time and to hear their voice, to really get to know the personality behind the person we were treating. Usama, 23, a medical student from Solihull, had a similar experience. ""Just a couple of days ago I saw someone come in with cardiac arrest and you go and check on them, and they're doing fine. Zara, a 20-year-old student nurse from Durham, has been telling Newsbeat how she got into nursing. ""The reason I wanted to go into nursing is that I did volunteer work in a chemotheraphy unit at Sunderland hospital."" ""The nurses I met, the doctors, the healthcare assistants, were amazing and inspirational. They inspired me to be a nurse. ""Even though the pressures of nursing are getting harder and harder, if you've got a real drive and passion to care for people, making them smile, it's so worth it. ""I would be lying if said I was feeling negative about my future career within the NHS. It's all about following a positive action and making sure your career in the NHS in the future is going to be great."" David, 24, from Glasgow, is training to be an occupational therapist in Leeds. ""My family have always worked in the NHS as long as I can remember,"" he tells Newsbeat. He began working in the health service eight years ago, as a domestic assistant in a small hospital in Scotland. ""I decided to go into occupational therapy because I've worked lower down in the NHS and was kind of overwhelmed by the effect a team can have on an individual."" He's preparing for a placement later this year. ""Every week we go through scenarios that OTs might face in the workplace."" ""Personally I'm really excited about my future career in the NHS. I think there are a lot of doors being opened for occupational therapists, especially in the community care aspect of things. Getting patients home is really important to the NHS."" But he concedes it's a ""slightly worrying time"" for staff with constant talk of crisis. ""Privatisation is already going on in the NHS. Private companies are being used by overstretched NHS facilities. ""I think it's a worrying route for the NHS to go down. Where is the line drawn? Before you know it, the NHS is no longer anything like it is at the moment."" Elena, 20, from Reading, is studying children's nursing. ""I decided to go into nursing because I've always liked the idea of looking after people. ""The pressure is quite high but I like the joy of putting a smile on a little child's face - as well as their family. She aims to make the ""whole experience of being in hospital as stress-free as possible"". ""I work alongside the qualified nurses. I can do pretty much everything. I do 12-hour shifts like the normal nurses. ""The hardest bit is when you see a really sick child. You have to be able to detach yourself. You get used to it after a while.""

"Over the next month, elections will be held in five Indian states, but all eyes are on Uttar Pradesh As the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh begins a seven-phase election later this week to choose a new government, the BBC's Geeta Pandey in Delhi explains why these polls matter. Over the next month, elections will be held in five Indian states, but all eyes are on the key battleground of Uttar Pradesh. Commonly known by its initials UP, the state is India's most populous, with an estimated 240 million people. If it were a separate country, UP would be the fifth-largest by population in the world, after China, India, the United States and Indonesia - and larger than Pakistan or Brazil. The state sends the largest number of MPs - 80 - to India's parliament and it is often said that the party that wins the state ends up ruling the country. Several prime ministers, including India's first PM Jawaharlal Nehru, have come from here. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is from the western state of Gujarat, also chose to make his parliamentary debut from the state in the 2014 general election when he stood in Varanasi. In 2019, he was re-elected from there. And voters in the state can easily claim the credit for his Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) sweep of the last two general elections - in 2014, the party won 71 seats here; in 2019, it got 62. Since the late 1990s, state politics have been dominated by the regional Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP). As the two alternated in power, the Congress and the BJP were pushed to the margins. But in 2017, the BJP won a thumping majority, winning 312 of the 403 state assembly seats and nearly 40% of the popular vote, riding on the popularity and charisma of PM Modi. The party chose Yogi Adityanath, a highly polarising saffron-robed Hindu monk-turned politician known for his divisive views, as the chief minister and he is hoping for an encore when the votes are counted on 10 March. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's BJP won a thumping majority in the state in 2017 Lending him a helping hand is Mr Modi who has made nearly a dozen trips to the state in recent months, addressing gatherings and exhorting voters to give the BJP another chance. In the past year though, the party has lost a lot of ground over contentious farm laws - which the government scrapped after a year of protests by farmers - and the state government's disastrous handling of the Covid-19 pandemic last year. Hundreds of bodies, believed to be of people who lost their lives to coronavirus, turned up in the Ganges river. India's holiest river is swollen with bodies Anger rises as Covid rages in Modi's constituency And although the government has been appreciated for providing free rations during the pandemic, there's discontent over a lack of jobs among young people and runaway inflation. At election rallies though, Mr Adityanath, 49, has been claiming to have created plenty of jobs, boosted the economy and improved law and order in the state. He's also been using anti-Muslim rhetoric to win Hindu votes. Mr Adityanath's main challenger is the Samajwadi Party led by 48-year-old Akhilesh Yadav, a former chief minister ousted by the BJP in 2017. Mr Yadav has been working hard to wrest power from the BJP, and he's promised free electricity to all households, pensions for  poor women and interest-free loans to farmers if he's voted into power. His chances have brightened after he stitched up alliances with a number of smaller regional parties. The BSP, led by Dalit (formerly Untouchables) icon Ms Mayawati, is also seeking a comeback but not many are willing to bet on her. The four-time state chief minister, who lost power in 2012, is popular among her community, but during her earlier stints she was criticised for spending millions of dollars to build statues of herself and other Dalit icons. Out of power now for a decade, she has been pushed to the sidelines and has maintained a low profile this election season. The BJP's main challenger is Akhilesh Yadav who leads the Samajwadi Party A host of smaller parties are also in the fray and so is the Congress, India's main opposition party. Led by Priyanka Gandhi, the Congress has grabbed attention with her energetic campaign. She has made news by visiting families of rape victims and police atrocities; and her focus on female voters has made headlines. Even as her personal stock remains high, her campaign is hobbled by a lack of support on the ground. 'Wherever you look, you see ambulances and bodies' India's Priyanka Gandhi demands justice for farmers Because of its sheer size and numbers, Uttar Pradesh  is a crucial battleground. And for the parties in the fray, these elections are being seen as a do-or-die battle. No party has won a second term here since 1989, so the BJP and Mr Adityanath will be keen to break that jinx. The election result will also be seen as a referendum on his politics of Hindu nationalism. For Mr Modi too, the elections are significant as UP is seen as a test run before the 2024 general elections and if the BJP loses here, it will be seen as a sign that the pull of the party and the prime minister are on the decline. A victory for Akhilesh Yadav is crucial as another term out of power is likely to weaken his position as the leader of his party. A loss will also likely put an end to the alliances he's forged with smaller regional groups. A win is also absolutely essential for Ms Mayawati, who has spent the past 10 years in the political wilderness. Analysts say if she loses this time too, she may never be able to bounce back. The Congress, analysts say, is not really playing for a win this time, but is hoping that all the hard work put in by Priyanka Gandhi will help revive the party and help it build for a substantial role in the future. The Congress' Priyanka Gandhi has grabbed the eyeballs with her energetic campaign With 403 seats up for grabs, thousands of contestants are in the fray, fighting for a share of the pie. More than 150 million voters will be casting their votes at 174,351 polling centres, during the seven phases of voting spread over a month. Thousands of police and paramilitary troops are being deployed to ensure the elections are free and fair. But despite its political significance, UP remains one of India's least developed states and home to the largest numbers of poor people in the country. According to the recently-released first-ever multidimensional poverty index, 37.79% of the state's population lives in poverty, more than 44% are deprived of nutrition and millions still have no access to toilets. For the voters, the only way to express themselves is through their vote. And during elections they come out in large numbers to use it - often against those in power. 10 February: 58 seats 14 February: 55 seats 20  February: 59 seats 23 February: 59 seats 27 February: 61 seats 3 March: 57 seats 7 March: 54 seats Vote counting: 10 March This video can not be played Modi's India: Is Modi failing the jobless?

"Lost in translation: A video of the pair has been widely shared on social media A tour guide at a Tanzanian game park has been arrested after wrongly translating a tourist's comments about the country and its people. In a widely circulated video clip, the guide says in Swahili that the tourist wants Tanzanians to stop ""complaining"" about hunger. The woman, in fact, says Tanzanians are ""fabulously wonderful"". The guide was arrested on the tourism minister's order for casting the ministry in a ""bad light"", police said. Tanzania markets itself as The Soul of Africa, and is popular with tourists because of its wildlife and spectacular scenery. Africa Live: More updates on this and other stories 'No WhatsApp chats, please' Automated cameras record Serengeti life Worries over new roads in Serengeti The unnamed guide, from the state-run Serengeti National Park in the north, has not been charged with any offence. Regional police commander Jaffari Mohammed told the BBC that he had ""misled"" the tourist, and police were investigating whether he had circulated the video on social media in violation of cybercrime legislation. The controversial law allows for a minimum fine of about $1,300 (Â£1,000) and a minimum jail term of three months for publishing false, deceptive or misleading information on a computer system. The law was introduced in 2015, despite complaints by politicians, social media experts and human rights activists that it gave the police ""too much power"" without adequate oversight. The BBC's Lizzy Masinga in the main city, Dar es Salaam, says some of the guide's words were similar to those used by President John Magufuli, when he called on people at a rally last month to stop complaining about hunger. In excerpts of the videopublished by a Kenyan newspaper,external, the conversation goes: Tourist:""Hi. My visit to Tanzania has been beautiful, gorgeous. The people are fabulously wonderful and friendly. Greetings are always jambo [the Swahili equivalent of Hello]. Happy to be here. The land is beautiful, beautiful. The animals are wonderful."" Guide (translating):""You Tanzanians complain/cry a lot about hunger. Everyday you cry about hunger when you have flowers at home. Why don't you boil the flowers and drink [them]. It is not good to cry/complain about hunger."" Tourist:""The variety of animals and people you see is incredible, unlike anywhere else. It is just fabulous."" Guide:""You are asking your president to cook for you. Do you think your president is a cook? Can you get busy, even boil your clothing and eat."" Tourist:""It will be an experience to savour for all of your life. It is fantastic and beautiful and incredible and just unremarkable. Guide:""Get busy in every corner of the country. The president can't leave State House to cook for you. You have to cook for yourselves. George and Amal Clooney expecting twins Should I worry about arsenic in my rice?

"There is much rejoicing that the unit handling claims of abuse against British troops in Iraq is to be scrapped. Three papers believe their campaigns against the Iraq Historic Allegations Team (Ihat) played important parts in its downfall. ""At last, an end to the witch-hunt,""says the front-page headline in the Daily Mail,external. The paper believes what it calls the ""ruthless hounding of hundreds of innocent soldiers"" has been ""one of the most shameful chapters"" in the annals of British justice. It says the exercise has been a ""nice little earner"" for lawyers, agents, Iraqi civilians who received compensation and the Ihat investigators, while troops had their reputations ""smeared"". The Mail describes a separate inquiry - into killings carried out by British soldiers during the Troubles in Northern Ireland - as ""another, politically motivated witch-hunt"". The Sun condemns Ihat,externalfor ""blackening the Army's name"". It features the testimony of a former sergeant who says he was ""left to rot"" while lawyers investigated him for shooting an Iraqi who had been threatening his colleagues with an assault rifle. While the sergeant was cleared of unlawful killing, the ordeal left him with post-traumatic stress disorder. The Daily Telegraph also campaigned,externalfor Ihat to be shut down. Its leader column congratulates the government for taking action, but insists that ministers still need to explain why they endorsed the ""unfounded pursuit"" through the courts of people serving Queen and country. The paper believes the Iraq investigations amounted to an ""abuse of process"" which should have been abandoned much earlier. The Guardian leads on court documents,externalthat suggest Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson called for British arms sales to Saudi Arabia to continue, even after last October's bombing of a funeral in Yemen, which killed more than 140 people. The letters were disclosed this week during a judicial review of the decision to continue licensing weapons exports to Saudi Arabia. The case was brought by the Campaign Against Arms Trade. The paper argues that since Saudi airstrikes have hit hospitals, schools and weddings in Yemen, they are at the very least ""reckless"" and in many cases ""deliberate"". The Guardian concludes that arms sales to the kingdom are immoral and ministers should halt them immediately. The Daily Express says there has been an angry reaction,externalto reports that Brussels is preparing to hit the UK with a Â£49bn bill for leaving the EU. The paper says that figure is too much - in fact, at least Â£49bn too much. It argues that since the UK is one of only a handful of net contributors to the EU, ""they should be paying us"". There is potentially bad news for great crested newts in theFinancial Times,external, and it is down to - what else? - Brexit. The paper says the amphibians are facing a less certain future once Britain leaves the EU. It says it has been told by government sources that the EU habitats directive is to be repealed, as it gives ""excessive"" protection to great crested newts. The FT cites the example of the newt colony that held up the building of a railway station in Derbyshire. Despite attempts to catch and re-home the creatures, more just kept on turning up.
