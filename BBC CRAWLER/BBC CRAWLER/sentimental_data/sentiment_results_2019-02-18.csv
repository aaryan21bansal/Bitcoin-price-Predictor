"This video can not be played On Monday Shamima Begum told the BBC she never sought to be an IS ""poster girl"" Shamima Begum - the schoolgirl who fled London to join the Islamic State group in Syria - has said she never wanted to be an IS ""poster girl"". Ms Begum, who has just given birth, said she now wants the UK's forgiveness and supports ""some British values"". She told the BBC while it was ""wrong"" innocent people died in the 2017 Manchester attack, it was ""kind of retaliation"" for attacks on IS. The 19-year-old left Bethnal Green four years ago with two school friends. There has been debate about Ms Begum's plight since she wasfound in a Syrian refugee camp by the Times newspaperlast week after reportedly leaving Baghuz, IS's last stronghold in the country. She gave birth to a baby boy last weekend, having previously lost two children, and named him after her first son. While she told the BBC she would have let her late son become an IS fighter, she wants her new baby ""to be British"" and for her to return to the UK with him. IS teenage bride Begum gives birth What can the UK do about the IS teenager? How do countries deal with IS returnees? In an interview with the BBC's Middle East correspondent Quentin Sommerville on Monday, Ms Begum said: ""I don't actually agree with everything they've done. ""I actually do support some British values and I am willing to go back to the UK and settle back again and rehabilitate and that stuff."" Home Secretary Sajid Javid told MPs on Monday that he would not ""hesitate to prevent"" the return of Britons who travelled to Syria to join IS. While the UK cannot leave people stateless, under international law, he said any such Britons would be ""questioned, investigated and potentially prosecuted"". No British troops would be used to help or rescue them, he said. He told MPs that more than 100 dual nationals have already lost their UK citizenship after travelling in support of terrorist groups. ""If you back terror, there must be consequences,"" he said. More than 900 people have left the UK to join the conflict in Syria, said Mr Javid, adding that those who join IS have ""shown they hate our country and the values that we stand for"". Ms Begum was 15 and living in Bethnal Green, London, when she left the UK in 2015 Asked about theManchester Arena attack in 2017in which 22 people - some of them children - were killed in a bombing claimed by IS, she said: ""I was shocked. I didn't know about the kids, actually. I do feel that is wrong. Innocent people did get killed."" She compared the attack to military assaults on Syria, saying: ""It's one thing to kill a soldier, it's fine, it's self-defence. But to kill people like women and children just like the women and children in Baghuz who are being killed right now unjustly by the bombings - it's a two-way thing really because women and children are being killed back in the Islamic State right now. ""It's kind of retaliation. Their justification was that it was retaliation so I thought, okay, that is a fair justification."" Ms Begum said she was sorry for all the families who had lost people because of the attacks in the UK and other countries. ""That wasn't fair on them,"" she said. ""They weren't fighting anyone. They weren't causing any harm. But neither was I and neither were other women who are being killed right now back in Baghuz."" When it was suggested that her going to Syria might have been a ""propaganda victory"" for IS, Ms Begum said: ""I did hear a lot of people were encouraged to come after, but I wasn't the one who put myself on the news."" She added: ""The poster girl thing was not my choice."" Ms Begum said she made the choice to go to Syria and could make her own decisions, despite being only 15 at the time. She said she was partly inspired by videos of fighters beheading hostages and also by videos showing ""the good life"" under IS. She watched videos of the murders of British hostages, she told the BBC, but said she did not know the names of any of the victims. Our correspondent said that ""throughout the interview, Shamima Begum continued to espouse Islamic State philosophy."" He added: ""When I asked her about the enslavement, murder and rape of Yazidi women by IS, she said 'Shia do the same in Iraq'."" But she said: ""I just want forgiveness really, from the UK. Everything I've been through, I didn't expect I would go through that. ""Losing my children the way I lost them, I don't want to lose this baby as well and this is really not a place to raise children, this camp."" Twelve more British women have arrived at the camp in Syria in the last week and more are expected, our correspondent added. This video can not be played Tasnime Akunjee, the lawyer for the family of Shamima Begum, expects her to be ""damaged"" by her ordeal Earlier, the lawyer representing Ms Begum's family said she is ""damaged"" and will need mental health support. Tasnime Akunjee also said her family are prepared to raise her newborn baby away from ""IS thinking"". He said Ms Begum - who is legally British - had still not been in contact with her family and the family are trying to get the government to provide travel documents for Ms Begum and her newborn son, who he said has a right to citizenship. Ms Begum left the UK in February 2015 with two other schoolgirls, Kadiza Sultana and Amira Abase. Kadiza is thought to have died when a house was blown up, and the fate of Amira is unknown. Mr Akunjee also called for an ""urgent inquiry"" into how Ms Begum and the other schoolgirls were able to travel to Syria. Kadiza Sultana, Amira Abase and Shamima Begum (l-r) in photos issued by police Previously, Ms Begum said she escaped from Baghuz, Islamic State's last stronghold in eastern Syria, two weeks ago.

"The photograph has appeared in exhibitions around the world The US sailor famously photographed kissing a stranger in New York's Times Square to celebrate the end of World War Two has died aged 95. The picture of George Mendonsa bending over and kissing 21-year-old Greta Zimmer Friedman on VJ Day (Victory over Japan) became one of the most enduring images of the period. It was one of four photographs taken by Alfred Eisenstadt as a round-up of celebration pictures for Life magazine. Ms Friedman died in 2016 aged 92. Mr Mendonsa's daughter, Sharon Molleur, said her father suffered a seizure and died on Sunday after a fall at a care home in Middletown, Rhode Island. George Mendonsa holds the iconic photo by Alfred Eisenstadt in 2012 in his home in Rhode Island Alfred Eisenstadt did not give the names of the kissing strangers and it was years before Mr Mendonsa and Ms Friedman were confirmed as the featured couple. The photographer described how he watched the sailor running along the street on 14 August 1945, grabbing any girl in sight. ""I was running ahead of him with my Leica looking back over my shoulder but none of the pictures that were possible pleased me,"" he wrote in the book Eisenstadt on Eisenstadt. ""Then suddenly, in a flash, I saw something white being grabbed. I turned around and clicked the moment the sailor kissed the nurse. If she had been dressed in a dark dress I would never have taken the picture."" Ms Friedman, who had been working as a dental assistant, said she had not been aware of the photo until the 1960s. ""It wasn't much of a kiss,"" she later recalled. ""It was just somebody celebrating. It wasn't a romantic event."" Mr Mendonsa had served in the Pacific and was on home leave when the picture was taken. However, not everyone sees the photograph as something to celebrate. Although it was widely lauded as an expression of the joy felt across the US on the day Japan surrendered, in more recent times some have considered it,as Time Magazine wrote,external, ""as little more than the documentation of a very public sexual assault"".

"Janet Osborne hopes to continue gardening if her sight loss is halted A woman from Oxford has become the first person in the world to have gene therapy to try to halt the most common form of blindness in the Western world. Surgeons injected a synthetic gene into the back of Janet Osborne's eye in a bid to prevent more cells from dying. It is the first treatment to target the underlying genetic cause of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). About 600,000 people in the UK are affected by AMD, of whom 350,000 are severely sight impaired. Janet Osborne told BBC News: ""I find it difficult to recognise faces with my left eye because my central vision is blurred - and if this treatment could stop that getting worse, it would be amazing."" The treatment was carried out under local anaesthetic last month at Oxford Eye Hospital byRobert MacLaren, professor of ophthalmology at the University of Oxford.,external He told BBC News: ""A genetic treatment administered early on to preserve vision in patients who would otherwise lose their sight would be a tremendous breakthrough in ophthalmology and certainly something I hope to see in the near future."" Mrs Osborne, 80, is the first of 10 patients with AMD taking part in a trial of the gene therapy treatment, manufactured byGyroscope Therapeutics,external, funded by Syncona, the Wellcome Trust founded investment firm. The macula is part of the retina and responsible for central vision and fine detail. In age-related macular degeneration, the retinal cells die and are not renewed. The risk of getting AMD increases with age. Most of those affected, including all those on this trial, have what is known as dry AMD, where the decline in sight is gradual and can take many years. Wet AMD can develop suddenly and lead to rapid vision loss but can be treated if caught quickly. Prof Robert MacLaren inserting gene therapy into Janet Osborne's left eye As some people age, genes responsible for the eye's natural defences start to malfunction and begin destroying cells in the macula, leading to vision loss. An injection is made at the back of the eye, which delivers a harmless virus containing a synthetic gene. The virus infects the retinal cells and releases the gene. This enables the eye to make a protein designed to stop cells from dying and so keep the macula healthy. The early stage trial, at Oxford Eye Hospital, is primarily designed to check the safety of the procedure and is being carried out in patients who have already lost some vision. If successful, the aim would be to treat patients before they have lost any sight, in a bid to halt AMD in its tracks. That would have major implications for patients' quality of life. It is too early to know if Mrs Osborne's sight loss in her left eye has been halted but all those on the trial will have their vision monitored. Speaking at home, she told BBC News:  ""I still enjoy gardening with my husband, Nick, who grows a lot of vegetables. ""If I can keep peeling and cutting the veg, and retain my current level of independence, it would be absolutely wonderful."" There is already a successful gene therapy treatment for another rare eye disorder. In 2016, thesame team in Oxfordshowed that a single injection could improve the vision of patients with choroideremia, who would otherwise have gone blind. And, last year,doctors at Moorfields Eye Hospital, in London, restored the sight of two patients with AMD by implanting a patch of stem cells over the damaged area at the back of the eye. It is hoped that stem cell therapy could help many people who have already lost their sight. But the Oxford trial is different because it aims to tackle the underlying genetic cause of AMD and might be effective in stopping the disease before people go blind.

"This video can not be played McCabe: ""There were concerns about Trump's intent"" US President Donald Trump has issued an angry response after a TV interview on Sunday alleged that officials had held discussions to have him removed. Mr Trump tweeted of ""illegal and treasonous"" behaviour and an ""illegal coup attempt"". In the interview, ex-acting FBI chief Andrew McCabe said talks had been held in 2017 about invoking a clause that can remove a president deemed unfit. The Senate Judiciary Committee chairman has vowed to investigate the claims. Lindsey Graham said the claims were an ""attempted bureaucratic coup"". The White House revolving door: Who's gone? Mr McCabe said Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein had held discussions on the number of cabinet members and others needed to invoke the clause, the 25th Amendment of the US Constitution. In a series of tweets on Monday morning, he condemned ""so many lies by now disgraced acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe. He was fired for lying and now his story gets even more deranged. ""He and Rod Rosenstein, who was hired by [then Attorney General] Jeff Sessions (another beauty), look like they were planning a very illegal act, and got caught."" Mr Trump added: ""There is a lot of explaining to do to the millions of people who had just elected a president who they really like and who has done a great job for them with the military. Vets. Economy and so much more. This was the illegal and treasonous 'insurance policy' in full action!""

The justice department said Mr McCabe's account was ""inaccurate and factually incorrect"". Allegations that Mr Rosenstein discussed invoking the 25th Amendment were first reported last year by the New York Times. However, Mr McCabe's quotes are the first to be made on the record from someone present at the meeting where the alleged comments were reportedly made - in May 2017, after Mr Trump fired FBI director James Comey. ""The discussion of the 25th Amendment was simply [that] Rod raised the issue and discussed it with me in the context of thinking about how many other cabinet officials might support such an effort,"" he said. Mr McCabe also said Mr Rosenstein was openly ""counting votes, or possible votes"" and that he was ""very concerned"" about the president ""his capacity and about his intent at that point in time."" ""To be fair, it was an unbelievably stressful time... it was really something that he kind of threw out in a very frenzied chaotic conversation."" Mr Rosenstein has previously strongly denied having such discussions, saying there was ""no basis"" to invoking the amendment. In the 60 Minutes interview, aired on Sunday, Mr McCabe also covered allegations Mr Rosenstein had offered to secretly record Mr Trump, amid concerns about possible obstruction of justice relating to the investigation into alleged collusion between the president's campaign team and Russia. Rod Rosenstein previously said there was ""no basis to invoke the 25th Amendment"" When the allegations first emerged in the New York Times, Mr Rosenstein said the report was ""inaccurate and factually incorrect"". A source told the BBC at the time that Mr Rosenstein's comment ""was sarcastic and was never discussed with any intention of recording a conversation with the president"". However, Mr McCabe said that Mr Rosenstein ""was not joking. He was absolutely serious"". ""It was incredibly turbulent, incredibly stressful. And it was clear to me that that stress was - was impacting the deputy attorney general."" Trump Russia affair: Key questions answered Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? He added: ""I never actually considered taking him up on the offer.""

"Huawei, the Chinese telecoms giant, has hit the headlines over the arrest of the founder's daughter in Canada for extradition to the United States. But the firm, which manufactures a range of technology, from network equipment to mobile phones, is on the agenda for other reasons, too. Several governments around the world have blocked telecoms companies from using Huawei gear in next-generation 5G mobile networks, citing security concerns. So far the UK has held back from any formal ban. So why is the company proving so controversial? Fifth-generation mobile broadband is coming over the next year or so, promising download and browsing speeds 10 to 20 times faster than those today's 4G networks can offer. This video can not be played Will superfast 5G mobile be worth the money? This superfast mobile connectivity means you might be able to livestream a high-definition film to your phone, say, or enjoy much higher quality augmented and virtual reality experiences while you're out and about. It will also power the ""internet of things"", enabling connected machines, from traffic lights to driverless cars, to communicate with each other. What is 5G and what will it mean for you? The company started out making equipment for mobile phone networks and has grown rapidly, eclipsing the likes of Nokia and Ericsson, to become a global leader. More recently it has started making smartphones as well, andHuawei has now captured about 16% of the global market,external, making it the world's third-largest supplier after Samsung and Apple. Why Huawei matters in five charts Huawei finance chief arrested in Canada Why has UK not blocked Huawei? Decision time for UK over Huawei and 5G The firm's founder Ren Zhengfei, a former People's Liberation Army officer, started Huawei in 1987. It's based in Shenzhen, Guangdong, and is owned by 80,000 of its 180,000 employees. The US points to Mr Ren's military background and its growing global role to argue it represents a risk to national security. In principle, controlling the technology that sits at the heart of vital communications networks gives Huawei the capacity to conduct espionage or disrupt communications during any future dispute, particularly as more things, from autonomous vehicles to domestic appliances, become connected to the internet. Countries using Huawei equipment monitor such risks carefully. Ren Zhengfei founded Huawei in 1987 But the US also points more generally to China's National Intelligence Law passed in 2017 that says organisations must ""support, co-operate with and collaborate in national intelligence work"". As a result, the US, Australia and New Zealand have all blocked local firms from using Huawei to provide the technology for their 5G networks. That's three of the five so-called ""Five Eyes"" intelligence sharing community. A fourth, Canada, is reviewing its relationship with the firm. And several European telecoms operators are considering removing the firm's equipment from their networks. Huawei's cyber security chief John Suffolk has moved to quell concerns about its operations, describing it as ""the most open [and] transparent company in the world"". In December, Canada arrested Huawei's chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou - Mr Ren's daughter - at the request of the US. Washington alleges that she committed fraud by lying to US banks about her firm's ties to a telecoms company that did business in Iran - and that business was a breach of sanctions on Iran. Huawei denies any wrongdoing, while China's ambassador to Canada has warned Ottawa there could be repercussions if Canada bans the firm. The UK has not taken a position, although it is also coming under pressure from the US to do so. Washington has warned its allies about the risks of using Huawei technology,external. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said that European countries that use the company's equipment ""makes it more difficult for us to partner alongside them"". The UK government has admitted to ""strains"" in the relationship with Huawei. The body tasked with overseeing internet security in Britain, the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) - part of GCHQ - has asked Huawei to fix problems that pose ""new risks"" to the network. Butthe NCSC recently concludedthat any risk posed by involving the Chinese technology giant in the development of new networks can be managed. Alex Younger, the head of the UK's intelligence service MI6, has suggested that ""some decisions"" lie ahead over Huawei's role, because 5G networks will make it harder to monitor security. Huawei offices in New Zealand, one of the nations citing national security concerns BT has announced it is in the process of removing Huawei's equipment from the core of its existing 3G and 4G mobile operations and will not use the Chinese company's gear in central parts of the next 5G network. But Huawei has been providing technology to UK firms for more than a decade and Britain is keen to maintain a good relationship with China on trade and investment as it prepares for Brexit. Most of the country's mobile networks - Vodafone, EE and Three - have already been working with Huawei to prepare their 5G offerings and it might not be easy to change that at short notice. The UK's mobile phone operators are waiting for a decision from the government on whether they can continue to use the Chinese giant's equipment - the ruling is expected to come in late March or early April. The company is keen to portray itself as a firm with no ties to the Chinese government. It says it prioritises safety and security when supplying technology and that at least some of the hostility towards it is because the firm poses a competitive threat. In the past the Chinese government has argued that moves to block the firm's products amount to ""protectionism"" and ""discriminatory practices"". Huawei has also filed a lawsuit challenging US government restrictions on its products being used by federal agencies. In a statement announcing the move, a spokesman for Huawei said the US had ""repeatedly failed to produce any evidence to support its restrictions"". The company also accused the US government of misleading the public about Huawei. The new hostility towards the company comes against a backdrop of heightened tensions between the US and China, with President Trump accusing Beijing of unfair trade practices and of facilitating the theft of intellectual property from US firms. Furthermore as several countries simultaneously plan to introduce faster 5G networks, the stakes are high for firms that win contracts. Emily Taylor at Chatham House said there was a ""standards war"" going on behind the scenes. ""I think the trade advantage from setting standards that favour your own domestic suppliers' technologies also plays a part in this,"" she told the BBC. Huawei: US scared we are too competitive.

"Huawei has said it is independent and gives nothing to Beijing, aside from taxes Any risk posed by involving the Chinese technology giant Huawei in UK telecoms projects can be managed, cyber-security chiefs have determined. The UK's National Cyber Security Centre's decision undermines US efforts to persuade its allies to ban the firm from 5G communications networks. The Chinese government is accused of using Huawei as a proxy so it can spy on rival nations. But Huawei has said it gives nothing to Beijing, aside from taxes. Why Huawei matters in five charts Should we worry about Huawei? Ren Zhengfei: Huawei's reclusive founder Australia, New Zealand, and the US have already banned Huawei from supplying equipment for their future fifth generation mobile broadband networks, while Canada is reviewing whether the company's products present a serious security threat. Most of the UK's mobile companies - Vodafone, EE and Three - have been working with Huawei on developing their 5G networks. They are awaiting on a government review, due in March or April, that will decide whether they can use Huawei technology. As first reported by the Financial Times, the conclusion by the National Cyber Security Centre - part of the intelligence agency GCHQ - will feed into the review. The decision has not yet been made public, but the security agency said in a statement it had ""a unique oversight and understanding of Huawei engineering and cyber security"". Huawei has denied that it poses any risk to the UK or any other country BBC business correspondent Rob Young said the National Cyber Security Centre's conclusion ""will carry weight"", but said the review could still rule against Huawei. In an interview, Huawei's cyber security chief John Suffolk told the BBC: ""We are probably the most open and transparent organisation in the world. We are probably the most poked and prodded organisation too."" The former UK chief information officer added: ""We don't say 'believe us' we say 'come and check for yourself', come and do your own testing and come and do your own verification. ""The more people looking, the more people touching, they can provide their own assurance without listening to what Huawei has to say."" Rory Cellan-Jones, technology correspondent If anybody knows just how Huawei works and the threat it might pose to the UK's security, it is the National Cyber Security Centre. This arm of GCHQ has been in charge of an annual examination of the Chinese telecoms giant's equipment, and expressed concerns in its most recent report - not about secret backdoors, but sloppy cyber-security practices. The NCSC has also been giving advice to UK mobile operators as they order the equipment for the rollout of their 5G networks later this year. They feel they have been given the same cautious nod the agency appears to have given the government's Supply Chain Review: keep Huawei out of the core of your 5G networks, but you are OK to use its equipment at phone masts as part of the mix of suppliers. Australia and New Zealand have taken a very different view by taking a far harder line against Huawei. That isn't because they know something about the Chinese firm which the NCSC has missed. Their decisions were probably based on an assessment of the political as well as security risk of ignoring the urging from the US to shut Huawei out. And whatever the NCSC's advice, similar factors will determine the UK government's final decision. A spokesperson for the Department of Culture, Media and Sport, which is leading the review into the future of the telecoms industry, said its analysis was ""ongoing"". ""No decisions have been taken and any suggestion to the contrary is inaccurate,"" they said in a statement. Huawei and 5G: Decision time Timeline: What's going on with Huawei? The Inquiry: What's so scary about Huawei? Asked whether the findings changed her country's stance towards Huawei, the prime minister of New Zealand - which is a member of the Five Eyes intelligence sharing network that includes the UK - said her government would conduct its own assessment. Jacinda Ardern told reporters: ""It is fair to say Five Eyes, of course, share information, but we make our own independent decisions."" Last year, BT confirmed that it was removing Huawei's equipment from the EE core network that it owns. The network provides a communication system being developed for the UK's emergency services. Fifth-generation mobile broadband is coming to the UK over the next year or so,promising download and browsing speeds 10 to 20 times faster than those 4G networks can offer. This video can not be played Will superfast 5G mobile be worth the money? The US argues Huawei could use malign software updates to spy on those using 5G. It points to China's National Intelligence Law passed in 2017 that says organisations must ""support, co-operate with and collaborate in national intelligence work"". Critics of Huawei also highlight that its founder Ren Zhengfei was a former engineer in the country's army and joined the Communist Party in 1978. Huawei recently attracted attention when its chief financial officer,Meng Wanzhou, was arrested and accused of breaking American sanctions on Iran.

"Huawei is the poster child for China's dynamic tech sector. It has grown phenomenally in recent years, from a small manufacturer of telephone exchange switches, to become a global leader in the tech industry. While the brand is familiar to many from its mobile phone handsets, Huawei has its finger in many other pies - from cloud services to artificial intelligence. And despite increasing controversy around whether using Huawei telecoms equipmentposes a security risk, the block on its business deals in some countries, andthe arrest in Canada of one of its executives, the company itself has continued on its steady path of global growth. That growth has come against the backdrop of China's continued rise, on its way to becoming the world's second largest economy, providing the firm with a huge base upon which to build its initial market as a springboard to international expansion. Most noticeably for consumers, Huawei has swept into the market for consumer electronics, in particular with smartphones. Earlier this year it overtook Apple in the number of handsets it was shipping worldwide. Shipments don't always translate into phones reaching consumers, but the uptick in production and distribution still reflectsa rise in Huawei's popularity, including for both premium models and its lower-priced Honor brand. Expanding sales of smartphones comes despite political hostility towards the brand in some parts of the world, especially the US. There, no carriers support Huawei, so while consumers can buy a Huawei phone, they aren't widely marketed. But it's in telecoms network equipment, which forms the largest part of Huawei's business, that is having its greatest impact on the company. The US has banned the use of Huawei equipment in communications networks, warning of security risks and has called for other governments to follow suit. Nevertheless, in all parts of the world, even in the Americas, the market for Huawei products has grown over the past three years. Washington's decision to block the use of Huawei equipment in telecommunications infrastructure on security grounds has been emulated in New Zealand, Australia and Japan. With the US pressing for other governments to follow suit, that raises questions over whether the firm's global expansion is set to be curtailed in some regions in the near future. Currently though, Huawei is holding its own in one of the largest parts of its business, the sale of mobile telecommunications infrastructure equipment, such as that needed to supportthe roll-out of faster 5G networks. But how much Huawei continues to grow, won't depend only on political attitudes in Western capitals. It will depend on how well the Chinese tech giant's products compare with its competitors. In the past, the firm has been accused - like many Chinese companies - of copying technology developed in the West and then undercutting rivals on prices. But Huawei is currently outspending many other global players in research and development in a bid to gain a future edge. Prospects may not be as bright for Huawei now as they used to be, given the political squeeze from the West. But, the firm went through the financial crisis largely unaffected thanks to a powerful domestic market in China, IHS Markit industry analyst Stephane Teral points out. The same could happen again if it loses more contracts in the West. ""Huawei went through this unfazed with no problems, because they were able to diversify at a time when China was just taking off, including telecoms restructuring, that really helped Huawei,"" he said.

"Chinese telecoms giant Huawei has been the focus of intense international scrutiny lately. Several countries have raised security concerns about its products, and Germany has considered blocking it from its next generation mobile network. The company is also accused of stealing trade secrets in the US, and its chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou is under house arrest in Canada. Ms Meng appeared in court for the first time in March. She has counter-sued the Canadian government over her arrest and detention. There are fears that China is using Huawei as a proxy so it can spy on rival nations and scoop up useful information. Huawei has said it is independent and gives nothing to the country's government, apart from relevant taxes. Critics question how free any major Chinese business can be from Beijing's influence. They point out that its media-shy founder Ren Zhengfei was a former engineer in the country's army and joined the Communist Party in 1978. In an interview with the BBC, Mr Rensaid the US' actions would not ""crush"" the company. ""If the lights go out in the West, the East will still shine,"" he said. Huawei is keen to portray itself as a private company owned by its employees with no ties to the Chinese government beyond those of a law-abiding taxpayer. Mr Ren said he would rather ""shut down"" Huawei than spy for the Chinese authorities.

It invested more than $13.2bn (Â£10.2bn) in 2017 and has said the figure will be even higher for 2018. It has said that building futuristic 5G networks without its technology and innovations would be like the Premier League without Manchester United. Huawei is now the second biggest smartphone-maker after Samsung But critics fear that the Chinese government could order the firm to modify its devices to help hack attacks, eavesdrop on conversations or gain high-level access to sensitive networks. There are questions about whether China would allow a technology firm that has been deeply embedded in rival nations' infrastructure to remain independent. Huawei is now the second biggest smartphone-maker in the world. In November 2018,New Zealandbarred Huawei from supplying a local mobile network with 5G equipment TheUSandAustraliahad already closed the door on Huawei's involvement in their next-generation mobile networks Canadais carrying out a security review of Huawei's products UKservice provider BT is removing Huawei kit from the core of its 5G network, and from infrastructure to be used by the emergency services On 7 December, theEU'stechnology commissioner Andrus Ansip said countries ""have to be worried"" about Chinese manufacturers The interior ministry ofGermanysays it opposes banning any suppliers from its 5G networks, but the country is now thought to be reconsidering The UK has not enacted a ban on the use of Huawei equipment. However, the firm's products are regularly subjected to security testing by the UK's GCHQ intelligence agency. The co-operative agreement between the UK and Huawei includes a facility nicknamed the Cell in Banbury, Oxfordshire. There, staff employed by Huawei but answering to GCHQ, look for security flaws in the company's products. The last report GCHQ produced said it found ""shortcomings"" in products that meant it could only give ""limited assurance"" that the firm posed no threat. Huawei has previously agreed to a series of technical demands by GCHQ that would harden its products against attackers. In its latest guidance, the UK's National Cyber Security Centresaid the dangers posed by Huaweitech were ""manageable"". Ms Meng faces extradition to the US on fraud charges Ms Meng was arrested while transferring between flights in Vancouver, although her detention was not revealed by Canadian authorities until four days later, the day of her first court appearance. Details of the charges were also not revealed at the time, after she was granted a publication ban by a Canadian judge. But at a bail hearing at the Supreme Court of British Columbia, a Canadian government lawyer said Ms Meng had used a Huawei subsidiary called Skycom to evade sanctions on Iran between 2009 and 2014. The court was told she had publicly misrepresented Skycom as being a separate company. Huawei finance chief arrested in Canada Why Huawei matters in five charts Why has the UK not blocked Huawei? China has demanded Ms Meng's release, insisting she has not violated any laws. In a statement, Huawei said it was not aware of any wrongdoing by Ms Meng, adding: ""The company believes the Canadian and US legal systems will ultimately reach a just conclusion.

"This video can not be played MPs resign from Labour over Brexit and anti-Semitism Seven MPs have resigned from the Labour Party in protest at Jeremy Corbyn's approach to Brexit and anti-Semitism. They are: Chuka Umunna, Luciana Berger, Chris Leslie, Angela Smith, Mike Gapes, Gavin Shuker and Ann Coffey. Ms Berger said Labour had become institutionally anti-Semitic and she was ""embarrassed and ashamed"" to stay. Mr Corbyn said he was ""disappointed"" the MPs had felt unable to continue working for the policies that ""inspired millions"" at the 2017 election. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said the ""honourable thing for them to do"" would be to stand down as MPs and seek to return to Parliament in by-elections. Kuenssberg: What next for Labour's breakaway MPs? Who are the Labour MPs resigning? 'Cowards and traitors' - how Twitter reacted Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson,in a video message on Facebook,external, urged the ""hard left"" to stop celebrating the departure of the seven MPs, saying it was ""a moment for regret and reflection not for a mood of anger or a tone of triumph"". This video can not be played John McDonnell: Resigning MPs have 'responsibility' to call by-elections ""Betrayal narratives and shouting insults at the departed might make some feel better briefly but it does nothing to address the reasons that good colleagues might want to leave,"" said Mr Watson. He said Luciana Berger's decision to quit was a ""wake-up call for the Labour Party"" over anti-Semitism, saying: ""We were slow to acknowledge we had a problem and even slower to deal with it."" Labour had to ""broaden out"" and become more tolerant, he said, adding: ""I love this party. But sometimes I no longer recognise it, that is why I do not regard those who have resigned today as traitors."" The seven MPs, who all back a further EU referendum, are not launching a new political party - they will sit in Parliament as the Independent Group. But Chuka Umunna said they had ""taken the first step"" and urged other Labour MPs - and members of other parties - to join them in ""building a new politics"". ""It is time we dumped this country's old-fashioned politics and created an alternative that does justice to who we are today and gives this country a politics fit for the here and now - the 21st Century,"" he said at a launch event in central London. He said there would be ""no merger"" with the Liberal Democrats, who have 11 MPs, and the group wanted to ""build a new alternative"". The group rejected comparisons with the Social Democratic Party - which broke away from the Labour Party in the early 1980s but eventually merged with the Liberal Party - saying it was a different era and they would not be contesting by-elections. Who were the Social Democratic Party? Labour: 673 anti-Semitism reports in 10 months A guide to Labour anti-Semitism claims Ina founding statement on its website,external, the group sets out its approach to the economy, public services and security, as well as Brexit. One of the seven MPs, Angela Smith, has, meanwhile, had to apologise after being criticised for a comment about skin colour on BBC Two's Politics Live programme. This video can not be played Angela Smith criticised over skin colour comment In a discussion about race, the MP appeared to say: ""It's not just about being black or a funny tinge."" She has sinceposted a video on Twitter,externalapologising for the comment, adding: ""I am very upset that I misspoke so badly."" By BBC Political Correspondent Iain Watson Defections to the Independent Group are likely to increase - but it will need to attract some of those beyond Labour to become a proper ""centre party"". Two more MPs were undecided about whether to be at the launch, one of them was 90% but clearly not 100% there. And more still may be persuaded to go unless they see a more robust response to anti-Semitism. But strong supporters of the Blair/Brown governments such as Peter Kyle and Ben Bradshaw are staying to fight their corner on Brexit and it's likely in the short term the numbers who do go will be small. This is no simple centrists v left, or indeed, ultra left split. However, the reaction of left-wing activists to today's drama could be crucial. If they feel fired up to de-select those who share the politics of the defectors but who have no intention of leaving Labour, the splinter could yet become a more sizeable split. Each of the seven took turns to explain their personal reasons for quitting the party. Ms Berger said: ""I am leaving behind a culture of bullying, bigotry and intimidation."" Chris Leslie said Labour under Mr Corbyn had been ""hijacked by the machine politics of the hard left"". Mike Gapes said he was ""sickened that Labour is now perceived by many as a racist, anti-Semitic party"" and ""furious that the Labour leadership is complicit in facilitating Brexit"".

In a statement, Jeremy Corbyn said: ""I am disappointed that these MPs have felt unable to continue to work together for the Labour policies that inspired millions at the last election and saw us increase our vote by the largest share since 1945."" GMB leader Tim Roache described the MPs' actions as ""unforgiveable"", adding that they were ""hardly the Magnificent Seven"". Unite general secretary Len McCluskey, a close ally of Mr Corbyn, said there was a ""strong whiff of hypocrisy"" about the resigning MPs because they had stood on a manifesto at the 2017 general election that ""promised to respect the 2016 referendum taking us out of Europe"". Jon Lansman, the founder of the pro-Corbyn Momentum campaign group, said he had ""personal sympathy"" for Ms Berger because of the ""hate and abuse"" she had suffered. But he said the other six MPs were malcontents opposed to Mr Corbyn's leadership, telling BBC Radio 4's World at One: ""These are people who are not heavyweights and do not have clear policies."" Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said the split was ""not unexpected, or unwelcome"" and his party was open to ""working with like-minded groups and individuals in order to give the people the final say on Brexit, with the option to remain in the EU"". Conservative Party Chairman Brandon Lewis said the resignations had confirmed that Labour ""has become the Jeremy Corbyn Party - failing to take action on everything from tackling anti-Jewish racism to keeping our country safe"". Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage, whose new Brexit Party launched earlier this year, tweeted: ""This moment may not look very exciting but it is the beginning of something bigger in British politics - realignment."" The resignation of seven Labour MPs leaves Jeremy Corbyn with 248 MPs under his leadership. For now, the new group will sit as independents, but could soon form a new political party. Five other MPs are already sitting as independents after leaving the Labour Party for various reasons, but they are not part of an organised group. Separately, Peterborough MP Fiona Onasanya was kicked out of the party when she was jailed in January. There are two other independent MPs - former Lib Dem Stephen Lloyd, who quit his party because he disagrees with them on Brexit, and North Down MP Lady Sylvia Hermon - a former Ulster Unionist. Not necessarily. Parties are membership organisations that are registered with the Electoral Commission and stand candidates in elections. They also have a leader. One major advantage of forming a party - rather than just a Parliamentary group - is that you qualify for government money to help with research, which may be a factor in the new group taking the next step. Under the rules of Parliament, none of the MPs who have resigned from Labour today have to put themselves forward for re-election in their constituencies.

"This video can not be played Ren Zhengfei described the arrest of his daughter Meng Wanzhou as politically motivated The founder of Huawei has said there is ""no way the US can crush"" the company, in an exclusive interview with the BBC. Ren Zhengfei described the arrest of his daughter Meng Wanzhou, the company's chief financial officer, as politically motivated. The US is pursuing criminal charges against Huawei and Ms Meng, including money laundering, bank fraud and stealing trade secrets. Huawei denies any wrongdoing. Mr Ren spoke to the BBC's Karishma Vaswani in his first international broadcast interview since Ms Meng was arrested - and dismissed the pressure from the US. ""There's no way the US can crush us,"" he said. ""The world cannot leave us because we are more advanced. Even if they persuade more countries not to use us temporarily, we can always scale things down a bit."" However, he acknowledged that the potential loss of custom could have a significant impact. Ren Zhengfei: Reclusive but confident Should we worry about Huawei? Who is Ren Zhengfei? Why Huawei matters in five charts What is 5G? Who is Meng Wanzhou? Last week, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo warned the country's allies against using Huawei technology, saying it would make it more difficult for Washington to ""partner alongside them"". Australia, New Zealand, and the US have already banned or blocked Huawei from supplying equipment for their future 5G mobile broadband networks, while Canada is reviewing whether the company's products present a serious security threat. Mr Ren warned that ""the world cannot leave us because we are more advanced"". ""If the lights go out in the West, the East will still shine. And if the North goes dark, there is still the South. America doesn't represent the world. America only represents a portion of the world."" The UK'sNational Cyber Security Centre has decidedthat any risk posed by using Huawei technology in UK telecoms projects can be managed. Many of the UK's mobile companies, including Vodafone, EE and Three, are working with Huawei to develop their 5G networks. They are awaiting a government review, due in March or April, that will decide whether they can use Huawei technology. Commenting on the possibility of a UK ban, Mr Ren said Huawei ""won't withdraw our investment because of this. We will continue to invest in the UK. ""We still trust in the UK, and we hope that the UK will trust us even more. ""We will invest even more in the UK. Because if the US doesn't trust us, then we will shift our investment from the US to the UK on an even bigger scale."" Huawei has denied that it poses any risk to the UK or any other country Mr Ren's daughter Meng Wanzhou, Huawei's chief financial officer, was arrested on 1 December in Vancouver at the request of the US, and is expected to be the subject of a formal extradition request. In total,23 charges are levelled against Huawei and Ms Weng. The charges are split across two indictments by the US Department of Justice. The first covers claims Huawei hid business links to Iran - which is subject to US trade sanctions. The second includes the charge of attempted theft of trade secrets. Mr Ren was clear in his opposition to the US accusations. ""Firstly, I object to what the US has done. This kind of politically motivated act is not acceptable. ""The US likes to sanction others, whenever there's an issue, they'll use such combative methods. ""We object to this. But now that we've gone down this path, we'll let the courts settle it."" Meng Wanzhou was arrested in Vancouver last December Huawei, which is China's largest private company, has been under scrutiny for its links to the Chinese government - with the US and others expressing concern its technology could be used by China's security services to spy. Under Chinese law, firms are compelled to ""support, co-operate with and collaborate in national intelligence work"". But Mr Ren said that allowing spying was a risk he wouldn't take. ""The Chinese government has already clearly said that it won't install any backdoors. And we won't install backdoors either. ""We're not going to risk the disgust of our country and of our customers all over the world, because of something like this. ""Our company will never undertake any spying activities. If we have any such actions, then I'll shut the company down."" Analysis - Karishma Vaswani, BBC Asia business correspondent - Shenzhen For a man known as reclusive and secretive, Ren Zhengfei seemed confident in the conviction that the business he's built for the last 30 years can withstand the scrutiny from Western governments. Mr Ren is right: the US makes up only a fraction of his overall business. But where I saw his mood change was when I asked him about his links to the Chinese military and the government. While he answered all of my questions, he refused to be drawn into a conversation on this, only to say that these were not facts, simply allegations - and insisted that political connections are not what has led Huawei to be successful today. When I put to him the reports that his former chairwoman, Sun Yafang, had once worked with China's Ministry of State Security, he told me that her profile was up on the company's corporate website and that he didn't think it was ""OK to suspect or guess where this person used to be"". He also confirmed that there is a Communist Party committee in Huawei, but he said this is what all companies - foreign or domestic - operating in China must have in order to abide by the law.

"Who are the 'South Bank seven'? And what might they do next? In a boiling hot, cramped room in a swish venue on the south bank of the Thames this morning, a small group of MPs made a big statement. Luciana Berger, Chris Leslie, Chuka Umunna, Mike Gapes, Anne Coffey, Angela Smith and Gavin Shuker all know they face an extremely bumpy future. But they hope together they'll start as a few, and end up being a group for the many. Their reasons for quitting are both historic and immediate. The splinter has been a long time coming because for a couple of years these MPs have been part of the large chunk of the Labour parliamentary party which had grave concerns about Jeremy Corbyn's leadership. Angela Smith, for example, now admits that during the 2017 election she was telling voters in her constituency that her leader could not, and would not be prime minister, despite campaigning for the party he was at the top of. Seven MPs leave Labour in Corbyn protest Who are the Labour MPs resigning? The seven who have decided to quit are not the only MPs I know of who did that. There have been fears, many publicly articulated but expressed with more fury in private, about the leadership's attitude to security policy, to Nato, as well as Jeremy Corbyn's response to the Skripal attack and his attitude to the Trident nuclear deterrent. One of those who has left described it today as ""Marxism in disguise"", illustrating the deep-seated, long-held and profound differences of world view. Add to that the hurt and concern inside the party over anti-Semitism that has built up over the last year, what the departing group have described as institutional racism towards Jewish people. Whatever else, let that sink in for a moment. That in 2019, a group of MPs believe that our main opposition party is institutionally biased against a minority group. But consider too the Labour leadership's hesitancy in campaigning full throttle for another referendum on staying in the EU, and the group, all of whom believe there should be another referendum, felt they had no choice but to quit. To do so goes against the grain of our tribal politics. Some of their colleagues are openly furious, accusing them of being ""cowards"". Others are responding more in sorrow than in anger. This is not an easy moment for anyone in the Labour party, and you could not have sat in that stuffy room this morning and felt it was an easy moment for any of those leaving either. Many other Labour MPs and members will see this as nothing less than a betrayal. And in our first-past-the-post system it is very hard to see in the short term, what kind of impact this group will have. So far they are not a political party, although they say they may evolve into one. So far they have no leader, and no policy programme as such. They are clearly open to welcoming disgruntled members of the Conservative party too. Their view is that our whole political system is broken and neither the Tories nor Labour are fit for purpose. And it is possible within days that they might be joined by a sprinkling of Tory MPs. This splintering might, just might - in time - turn into a much bigger redrawing of the landscape. For now though that is way off. And this is first and foremost about the Labour Party - the seeds of the splinter sown more than three years ago, bearing bitter fruit just when Parliament's biggest decisions over Brexit are about to be made. MPs still in the party will have a variety of reactions, from fury to sadness. But few of them now could pretend there isn't a problem, even prompting an astonishing admission from the party's deputy leader, Tom Watson, who - remember - is also elected by the members who so overwhelmingly supported Jeremy Corbyn. ""I love this party. But sometimes I no longer recognise it,"" he said. A warning that despite the government's many and multiple problems, it is Labour that's losing members and losing MPs.

"After months of rumours swirling around Westminster that Labour MPs might break away, seven resigned from the party in one go, and an eighth followed suit a day later. They were then joined by three MPs from the Conservative backbenches. The three Conservative MPs blamed ""a shift to the right"" in their party and the government's ""disastrous handling of Brexit"" as reasons for their departure. Labour MPs also cited their party's Brexit stance along with the leadership's handling of anti-Semitism.

"This video can not be played The creation of the SDP Commentators have been comparing the resignations of seven MPs from the Labour Party on Monday to the formation of the Social Democratic Party (SDP). But why has the latest change in Westminster's political layout reminded some of events dating back almost 40 years? Seven MPs leave Labour in Corbyn protest Gang of Four on Jeremy Corbyn The legacy of the SDP's Gang of Four In January 1981, four former cabinet ministers, Bill Rodgers, Shirley Williams, Roy Jenkins and David Owen, announced their intention, following the party's Wembley conference earlier that month, to move away from Labour. The ""gang of four"", as they were nicknamed, issued what became known as the Limehouse Declaration from Mr Owen's house in east London. Unhappy with the direction Labour was moving in - namely, to the left - they claimed ""a handful of trade union leaders [could] now dictate the choice of a future prime minister"". ""The gang of four"" - Bill Rodgers, Shirley Williams, Roy Jenkins, David Owen The founders wanted ""a new start in British politics"" and proposed a Council for Social Democracy to ""rally all those who are committed to the values, principles and policies of social democracy"". The leader of Labour at the time - Michael Foot - said he wanted them to stay and help to shape the party. But two months later, that council became the Social Democratic Party and eventually 28 Labour MPs would join the ranks, as well as one Conservative. In June of the same year, the SDP joined in an electoral alliance with the Liberal Party to take its ""new politics"" to the polls. Mrs Williams was the first member to stand as an SDP candidate and win, taking the seat of Crosby in November 1981. And come the election in 1983, the alliance was shown to have growing support - securing 25% of the vote. But thanks to the ""first past the post"" voting system in British elections, this amounted to only 23 MPs. After the election, however, Mr Foot, resigning as leader, blamed the alliance for siphoning off Labour votes and giving Margaret Thatcher and the Tories another term in government. The alliance went on to fight another election, in 1987, but again failed to make much of an impact on the numbers in the Commons - with almost 23% of the vote amounting to just 22 MPs. It was decided in 1988 that the SDP and the Liberal Party should merge - and the Liberal Democrats were born in October 1989. Mr Owen was unhappy with the decision and led a much smaller version of the SDP until 1990. Subsequent incarnations have not managed to make an impact on Westminster elections.

"This video can not be played ""Terrible. Doom and gloom"" - one worker describes the mood Honda is set to announce the closure of its Swindon car plant in 2022, with the loss of about 3,500 jobs. The Japanese company made 160,000 Honda Civics in Swindon last year, of which some 90% were sold to the UK, Europe and US. Honda has yet to make a formal announcement, and the Prime Minister's spokesman said Theresa May would not comment until an official confirmation. But local MP Justin Tomlinson said he had spoken to Honda, which confirmed it was consulting with ""all staff"". ""There is not expected to be any job losses, or changes in production until 2021,"" Mr Tomlinson said.  3,500total employees in Swindon 160,000Honda Civic cars built annually at the plant 90%of production sold to the UK, Europe and US 1989start of industrial operations Simon Jack: Is Japan losing faith in UK? Nissan Â£60m in doubt after investment U-turn Jaguar Land Rover posts Â£3.4bn loss The Unite union said the reports, if confirmed, would be a ""shattering body blow"". National officer Des Quinn said: ""The car industry in the UK over the last two decades has been the jewel in the crown for the manufacturing sector - and now it has been brought low by the chaotic Brexit uncertainty created by the rigid approach adopted by prime minister Theresa May."" As well as having a ""grave"" impact on workers and their families, it ""will also affect thousands of jobs in the extensive supply chain across the country"", he said. A spokesman for Prime Minister Theresa May said it was ""only right that we wait until the company has spoken with the workforce"" before commenting. The International Trade Secretary, Liam Fox, also declined to comment directly until an official announcement. But he pointed out that car demand had fallen since new diesel emissions rules were introduced across Europe. ""That big drop in demand by consumers is bound to have a knock on effect with producers,"" he said. Martin Huggins, a Honda worker for 25 years said: ""We haven't heard anything at all- all we have seen is what is on our phones. ""The management have told us nothing at all. This will be a sad day for Swindon as a whole, not just the workers but all the subsidiary companies that go with it."" Honda's Swindon plant is based at a former airfield In a tweet, Mr Tomlinson said: ""Honda are clear this is based on global trends and not Brexit, as all European market production will consolidate in Japan in 2021."" The car industry has also been struggling with falling demand in China and a slowdown in diesel sales. Honda's Swindon plant produces both VTEC turbo petrol engines and diesel i-DTEC engines. But according to Sky, Brexit is understood to be one factor in the decision, with the carmaker concerned about the imposition of new tariffs after the UK leaves the EU. Rival Japanese carmakerNissan also cited Brexitas one reason for cancelling plans to build its X-Trail SUV in Sunderland earlier this month. And Toyota and Jaguar Land Rover have expressed concern about the risk of a potential no-deal Brexit in recent months. Last week,Ford warned that a leaving the EU without a deal would be ""catastrophic"". The EU and Japan recently struck a trade deal which lowers tariffs on both parties' car exports to zero. James Atwood, deputy editor of Autocar magazine, said this could be a big factor behind Honda's decision. ""It allows Honda to produce their cars in Japan where most of their plants are and then ship them to the EU without having to pay the import tariffs they have been, which does reduce one of the reasons for needing a plant in the UK,"" he told BBC News. BBC business editor Simon Jack says the trade deal certainly ""means a dwindling rationale to base manufacturing inside the EU"". He said: ""Production at Swindon has been in decline for some time and is currently running at about half its capacity - another strike against it. But, having said that, Japanese companies are very long term investors. ""Sony and Panasonic moved their European headquarters to the EU. In each case, the rationale was slightly different. But many in Japan feel failure to provide Brexit certainty have loosened the ties that used to bind the two countries."" Read more from Simon here Only last autumn, Honda said it was committed to UK-based production regardless of the outcome of Brexit negotiations. But last month, it said it would shut the Swindon factory for six days in April as part of its preparations for any disruption caused post-Brexit. The company said the move was to ensure it could adjust to ""all possible outcomes caused by logistics and border issues"". The firm said it would help in recovering lost production if shipments of parts were held up at borders. Last year, the senior vice-president of Honda Europe warned that if the UK left the EU without a deal, it would cost his company tens of millions of pounds. Ian Howells told the BBC that quitting the bloc without an agreement would affect the carmaker's competitiveness in Europe. Honda UK is situated on a former airfield spanning 370 acres to the north-east of Swindon. The carmaker bought the site in 1985 and established Honda of the UK Manufacturing to inspect vehicles pre-delivery. In 1989, the operations expanded to producing engines.

"This video can not be played McCabe: ""There were concerns about Trump's intent"" US President Donald Trump has issued an angry response after a TV interview on Sunday alleged that officials had held discussions to have him removed. Mr Trump tweeted of ""illegal and treasonous"" behaviour and an ""illegal coup attempt"". In the interview, ex-acting FBI chief Andrew McCabe said talks had been held in 2017 about invoking a clause that can remove a president deemed unfit. The Senate Judiciary Committee chairman has vowed to investigate the claims. Lindsey Graham said the claims were an ""attempted bureaucratic coup"". The White House revolving door: Who's gone? Mr McCabe said Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein had held discussions on the number of cabinet members and others needed to invoke the clause, the 25th Amendment of the US Constitution. In a series of tweets on Monday morning, he condemned ""so many lies by now disgraced acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe. He was fired for lying and now his story gets even more deranged. ""He and Rod Rosenstein, who was hired by [then Attorney General] Jeff Sessions (another beauty), look like they were planning a very illegal act, and got caught."" Mr Trump added: ""There is a lot of explaining to do to the millions of people who had just elected a president who they really like and who has done a great job for them with the military. Vets. Economy and so much more. This was the illegal and treasonous 'insurance policy' in full action!""

The White House saidMr McCabe, who was fired last year for allegedly lying to government investigators, had ""no credibility"". The justice department said Mr McCabe's account was ""inaccurate and factually incorrect"". Allegations that Mr Rosenstein discussed invoking the 25th Amendment were first reported last year by the New York Times. However, Mr McCabe's quotes are the first to be made on the record from someone present at the meeting where the alleged comments were reportedly made - in May 2017, after Mr Trump fired FBI director James Comey. ""The discussion of the 25th Amendment was simply [that] Rod raised the issue and discussed it with me in the context of thinking about how many other cabinet officials might support such an effort,"" he said. Mr McCabe also said Mr Rosenstein was openly ""counting votes, or possible votes"" and that he was ""very concerned"" about the president ""his capacity and about his intent at that point in time."" ""To be fair, it was an unbelievably stressful time... it was really something that he kind of threw out in a very frenzied chaotic conversation."" Mr Rosenstein has previously strongly denied having such discussions, saying there was ""no basis"" to invoking the amendment. In the 60 Minutes interview, aired on Sunday, Mr McCabe also covered allegations Mr Rosenstein had offered to secretly record Mr Trump, amid concerns about possible obstruction of justice relating to the investigation into alleged collusion between the president's campaign team and Russia. Rod Rosenstein previously said there was ""no basis to invoke the 25th Amendment"" When the allegations first emerged in the New York Times, Mr Rosenstein said the report was ""inaccurate and factually incorrect"". A source told the BBC at the time that Mr Rosenstein's comment ""was sarcastic and was never discussed with any intention of recording a conversation with the president"". However, Mr McCabe said that Mr Rosenstein ""was not joking. He was absolutely serious"". ""It was incredibly turbulent, incredibly stressful. And it was clear to me that that stress was - was impacting the deputy attorney general."" Trump Russia affair: Key questions answered Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? He added: ""I never actually considered taking him up on the offer."" He described Mr McCabe's comments as ""stunning"" and pledged to hold a hearing at the Senate Judiciary Committee to determine ""who's telling the truth"". Senator Lindsey Graham said he was ""stunned"" by the latest comments by Andrew McCabe H said he could issue subpoenas - a court order forcing a witness to appear to give testimony - ""if that's what it takes"".

The vice-president would then become acting president. The president can give a written response then Congress would have to decide on removal, requiring a two-thirds majority in both houses. Ronald Reagan and George W Bush used the amendment to temporarily transfer power when they were medically anaesthetised. He took over as acting director of the FBI in 2017 and was himself fired as deputy director in March last year just two days before he was due to retire. He was sacked by Jeff Sessions, who said an internal review had found he leaked information and misled investigators.

Kent Police said officers had received a report of malicious communications.

"There is a ""very strong case"" for abolishing jail terms of less than six months in England and Wales, Justice Secretary David Gauke has said. He said shorter terms were not working for many inmates and courts should focus more on community rehabilitation. He acknowledged there were ""closely defined exceptions"" such as people convicted of violent or sexual crimes. Penal reform campaigners welcomed Mr Gauke's comments but fellow Tory MP Philip Davies said they were ""idiotic"". In a speech in central London, the justice secretary called for a more ""imaginative"" approach to sentencing. Why are community sentences falling out of favour? From prison cell to football coach ""We should be extremely cautious about continuing to increase sentences as a routine response to concerns over crime,"" he said. There should be a ""national debate about what justice, including punishment, should look like for our modern times"", he added. According to Mr Gauke, more than 250,000 custodial sentences of six months or less and more than 300,000 for 12 months or less were handed out in the past five years. He added nearly two thirds of those offenders go on to commit a further crime within a year of being released. Under the proposals, which could require legislation, short prison sentences would be replaced by ""robust"" community orders. Theannouncement on Saturdaythat GPS tagging technology would be rolled out nationwide to monitor offenders forms part of the plans. Mr Gauke challenged the view that there is only a choice between ""soft"" and ""hard"" justice. ""In my view, we should be talking about smart justice,"" he said. In Scotland, a presumption against prison sentences of less than three months is already in place and is due to be extended to 12 months. Official figures from 2018show those sentenced to short jail terms in Scotland were reconvicted almost twice as often in 12 months than those given community payback orders, which in most cases include unpaid work in the community. By Danny Shaw, BBC home affairs correspondent Penal reform has been on the government's agenda for the past three years - but what David Gauke is proposing goes much further. In February 2016, thenPrime Minister David Cameron said the system was ""stuck in the dark ages""but his most far-reaching proposals were for weekend imprisonment and greater governor autonomy. Two of Mr Gauke's predecessors, said they wanted to see fewer people locked up but neither suggested making changes to sentencing. The current justice secretary, however, said legislation to restrict the use of short sentences should be ""explored"" claiming there would be cross-party backing. It is a bold step for a Conservative minister to propose a measure knowing some in his party will criticise him for being ""soft"" on criminals. But after 13 months in the post Mr Gauke clearly feels he has the evidence to back up his case and the authority to carry it through. Charities working to reform penal policy welcomed the speech. The chief executive of Revolving Doors Agency, which campaigns for shorter prison sentences, said terms of less than six months were ""ineffective and disruptive"". Christina Marriott said short sentences ""contribute to prison churn and chaos, making it harder to rehabilitate the people who do need to be there"". The Prison Reform Trust said Mr Gauke was ""establishing a reputation as a thoughtful, balanced policy thinker, driven by evidence not preconception"". The cabinet minister is not the only voice in the government to advocate reform. In January, prisons minister Rory Stewarttold the Daily Telegraph,externalshort sentences were ""long enough to damage you and not long enough to heal you"". However, Conservative MP Philip Davies said Mr Gauke's proposals to abolish short terms were ""bonkers"". ""In virtually every case the offender has been given community sentence after community sentence and they are only sent to prison because they have failed to stop their offending,"" he said.

"Swedish activist Elin Ersson caused disruption on a plane that stopped the migrant being sent home. A Swedish activist has been fined 3,000 krona ($324; Â£251) for trying to stop the deportation of an Afghan migrant. University student Elin Ersson booked what she thought was the same flight as the Afghan, refusing to sit down unless he was taken off the plane. The migrant in question was not on the flight after all, but another Afghan was onboard for deportation after serving a prison sentence. Since the protest in July 2018, both Afghans have been expelled from Sweden. Ersson, 21, broadcasted her protest on Facebook from the Turkish Airlines plane, which was bound for Istanbul, Turkey, from Gothenburg, Sweden. In the video, Ersson said she did not agree with Sweden's policy of sending back rejected asylum seekers. Elin Ersson refused to sit until the Afghan was taken off the flight ""I'm not going to sit down until this person is off the plane, because he will most likely get killed,"" she said. The video shows how airline crew and other passengers urge her to sit down and to stop filming. Reality Check: Claims about migrants arriving in Italy Desperate migrants rescued from the sea UN sanctions for people traffickers in Libya Ersson was eventually removed from the plane, along with a 52-year-old Afghan and his escort from the Swedish Prison and Probation Service.

"Rail operators want fare regulations to change Traditional peak and off-peak rail fares face the axe under sweeping changes being proposed for the UK's train ticketing system. The Rail Delivery Group (RDG), which represents train operators, wants to eliminate the ""cliff edge"" between peak and off-peak prices. It argues that this would reduce overcrowding. Also, tap-in, tap-out rail fares could be expanded beyond London under the proposals published on Monday. The RDG's wish list of reforms is based on some 20,000 submissions on how the UK railways could be improved. Transport Focus, the independent passenger watchdog which also worked on the consultation, said UK train operators currently offered an ""outdated and outmoded fares and ticketing system"". Feedback from commuters found eight out of 10 want the fares system overhauled and nine out of 10 want smart or electronic tickets, with the potential for price capping. Pay-as-you-go fares and daily capping are already used for London commutes The Rail Delivery Group said reforms would support tap-in, tap-out fares - a pay-as-you-go method used in London - and more integration with other modes of transport. In London, tube and rail commuters can use contactless bank cards to automatically pay fares which are calculated based on where a passenger enters and exits the network. Reform would mean updating regulations around peak and off-peak travel, the RDG said, and ticket prices could be set more flexibly. This would reduce overcrowding, it said. Paul Plummer, RDG chief executive, said customers had different needs and wanted changes that offered value and better reflected changing work habits. ""Rail companies are already working together on plans for real world trials so people can see what our proposals could mean for them,"" he said. Rail companies needed the government to change rules on how train fares were charged, he added. ""Current regulation needs to be updated and we want to work with government, which is key to making improvements a reality, to deliver the better fares system the public wants to see."" The vast majority of rail users surveyed wanted changes to train fares The government is currently undertaking the Rail Review which is covering everything from commercial contracts to rail fare structures. Its consultation closes at the end of May. The RDG said its ideas could be rolled out, train operator by train operator, in as little as three years. Darren Shirley, chief executive of the Campaign for Better Transport, said the existing system was ""broken and desperately needs fixing"". ""We're particularly pleased to see proposals for more flexible commuter tickets to reflect modern work patterns, something we've long called for, and for nationwide smart ticketing. ""What's not clear however, is if these proposals will also lead to an end to the annual fares rise, which fails to reflect the level of service passengers receive the previous year. ""It is now up to the government to take forward these proposals to ensure we have a fares system that is fairer and easier to use."" Another proposal is to stop passengers having to buy split tickets to get the cheapest fares for some journeys. Tom Burridge, BBC transport correspondent How to reform the railways is a contentious, some might say politically toxic subject right now. A broad government-commissioned review into almost every aspect of the system is ongoing. Our out-dated and mind-bogglingly complicated ticketing system is a prime candidate for change. The system is, in the eyes of many, inherently flawed. How can an off-peak single sometimes cost a fraction less than a return? And how can it be that you get different prices for exactly the same journey? Technology is clearly a big part of the solution. But a tap-in, tap-out system which automatically ensures you the best fare for your journey is also partly about restoring trust. The t-word has become a precious commodity on the tracks of late, after a whole host of problems. The underlying message from train companies today is that they are on the side of passengers. They want to shunt the government towards positive change. More types of flexible fares is one thing, but cost and who pays will, as always, be almost every passenger's central concern. To make the proposals 'revenue neutral', as the operators plan, cheaper fares would have to be offset by more expensive ones. That is, unless the changes drive more people to travel by train, especially on more empty off-peak services. The initial mood music from those representing passengers is broadly positive. But some fear there could be winners and losers. Even with the support of government, one industry source said real change might not arrive for another three to five years.

"Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki (L) met Mr Netanyahu in Warsaw this month A summit of central European leaders in Israel has been cancelled because of an Israel-Poland row over the Holocaust. Poland withdrew after being angered by comments from Israeli leaders about Polish complicity in the Holocaust. In particular, Israel's acting Foreign Minister Yisrael Katz used the phrase, ""Poles imbibe anti-Semitism with their mother's milk"". Nazi Germany murdered six million Jews, mostly in Poland. Some Poles did collaborate with the Nazis. Mr Katz's remarks were ""racist and unacceptable"", Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said. There was also Polish fury at Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for saying ""Poles co-operated with the Germans"" during the Holocaust.

The meeting hosted by Israel was meant to bring together the four-nation Visegrad Group: Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia. But on Monday Israel said the three prime ministers attending - without Poland - would have bilateral meetings with Mr Netanyahu. Polish police probe Auschwitz protest Poland U-turn on Holocaust law The Holocaust year by year ""It will not be called Visegrad, because this entails the presence of all four,"" an Israeli spokesperson said. ""It's going to be a summit with Visegrad members."" Auschwitz, 1944: German SS guards carried out industrial-scale murder in occupied Poland The Polish government says its withdrawal is ""an unequivocal signal to other governments and international opinion that historical truth is fundamental"". By BBC Jerusalem correspondent Tom Bateman Mr Netanyahu has spent the last decade in office watching a wave of populist leaders come to prominence around the world. He has often embraced the rise of politicians who - mirroring his own impact on Israeli politics - combined muscular self-interest in foreign policy with attacks on established ""elites"" or the media at home. In the Visegrad Four leaders he saw a potent counterweight within the EU to what he believes is the bloc's anti-Israel stance. But for many critics in Israel this approach was always bound to backfire. They saw him as cosying up to a nationalist government in Poland they believed had tried to diminish the widespread cases of Polish collaboration with the Nazis during the Holocaust. And in the case of Viktor Orban in Hungary - to a leader accused by Jews in his own country of anti-Semitism. There is long-running tension between Poland's conservative government and Israel over the Holocaust. Last year a Polish law made it an offence to allege that the Polish nation was complicit in Nazi crimes. Prime Minister Morawiecki then suggested that some Jews were willing collaborators in the Holocaust, provoking a furious response in Israel. He told a journalist at the Munich Security Conference in February 2018: ""Of course it's not going to be punishable, [it's] not going to be seen as criminal to say that there were Polish perpetrators, as there were Jewish perpetrators, as there were Russian perpetrators, as there were Ukrainian; not only German perpetrators,"" he said. Poles protested outside the Israeli embassy on 15 February On Sunday, Israel's acting Foreign Minister Yisrael Katz said ""Poles imbibe anti-Semitism with their mother's milk"", quoting the late Israeli Prime Minister, Yitzhak Shamir. That in turn enraged Poland, which summoned Israeli ambassador Anne Azari to be warned that Poland could boycott the Visegrad summit. Mr Morawiecki then pulled out, saying of Mr Katz's remarks: ""These words are unacceptable both in diplomatic and public terms. Poles suffered [from Nazi Germany] the most, along with Jews and Roma [Gypsies]."" On Monday Poland withdrew from the summit completely. Research shows that thousands of Poles collaborated with the Nazis; but many other Poles risked their lives to help Jews - a fact recognised by Israel's Yad Vashem remembrance centre. The Nazis built many of their most notorious death camps in Poland after occupying the country at the beginning of the war in 1939. The Polish government argues that for too long Poles have been wrongly linked to crimes committed by Nazi Germany on Polish territory.

"Ebony Stevenson with surprise daughter Elodie A teenager who went into a coma after going to bed with a headache woke up four days later to discover she had given birth to a surprise baby girl. Ebony Stevenson, 18, from Oldham, said she had no idea she was pregnant when she went to bed feeling unwell. She was taken to hospital after suffering a series of seizures where medics discovered she was expecting. Her unborn baby developed in one of two wombs, in a rare condition called uterus didelphys. The sports physiotherapy student awoke on 6 December having had a 7lbs 10oz baby girl. Ms Stevenson said her pregnancy went unnoticed as she had not developed a bump, experienced morning sickness or missed a period. The first time mum, who named her daughter Elodie, said the whole experience was ""overwhelming to say the least"". ""Meeting my baby was so surreal. It felt like an out-of-body experience,"" she said. ""I worried I wouldn't bond with my daughter because I had no time to get my head around her arrival, but I think she's amazing. ""It's an absolute miracle. I wouldn't change Elodie for the world."" Baby's spine 'repaired' in the womb Sepsis survivor mum thanks hospital staff 'I had a stroke at the age of 25' Ms Stevenson's mother, Sheree, 39, said she called 999 after her daughter started being sick and having seizures on the bathroom floor. Doctors discovered they were caused bypreeclampsia,externaland then told her mother she was pregnant and that the baby needed to be delivered. She underwent an emergency Caesarean and gave birth to Elodie just over three hours after her first seizure. Her mother said: ""Despite me insisting she couldn't be pregnant, the paramedics were certain she was and, to my shock, a bump had appeared at her stomach."" Ms Stevenson said Elodie was put straight on her chest when she awoke. ""It sounds awful now, but I asked them to take her away as I was so confused and sure they'd made a mistake,"" she said. ""But my mum explained it all to me while the nurses were there and they gave my little girl back to me to hold properly for the first time. ""Although I was so confused - and pretty scared - it was a beautiful moment and she was so quiet."" Due to the weight of the baby, doctors believe Ms Stevenson actually carried Elodie to full-term. Ms Stevenson plans to go back to her studies at Hopwood College, Middleton, in February.

"An internet search for ""How do police find DNA"" was allegedly made on a phone said to belong to the 16-year-old accused of murdering Alesha MacPhail. A cybercrime expert told jurors the request was made on Google at 00:32 on 3 July last year, the day after the child's body was discovered. He said the phone was then used to access a How Stuff Works article entitled: ""Collecting DNA evidence"". The accused denies abducting, raping and murdering six-year-old Alesha. The evidence came from cybercrime team leader Peter Benson. It was contained in an 89-page report which was compiled after a forensic examination of an iPhone 6, said to belong to the accused. Alesha accused had 'fantasy' killing chat Alesha, six, had 'catastrophic' injuries Woman denies killing six-year-old Alesha Alesha's father 'sold cannabis to accused' Boy accused of Alesha murder blames woman Alesha's body was found in a wooded area on the Isle of Bute on 2 July last year. The High Court in Glasgow previously heard Alesha suffered 117 injuries and died from significant pressure being applied to her face and neck. She was only days into a summer break in Rothesay when she was killed. The teenager has lodged a special defence claiming the crime was committed by 18-year-old Toni McLachlan, who is the girlfriend of the victim's father. In previous evidence, Ms McLachlan has insisted she had nothing to do with Alesha's death. The court also heard from Det Con Ian Wilson on the sixth day of the trial, who described the accused's response when charged by police. The teenager was arrested on 4 July and was taken to Helen Street police station in Glasgow for a police interview, where he responded ""no comment"" to questions. On being charged with Alesha's murder, he also replied: ""No comment."" The detective said this was not unusual and was within the teenager's rights. Det Con Graham McIlwraith also gave evidence and said he searched the accused's home and noticed one knife missing from a block of five. Shown a photograph of a knife found on the shore opposite where Alesha had been staying, he said it ""would appear to be the same design"" as the Jamie Oliver brand knives found in the accused's house. The jury later heard that fibres found on Alesha's clothing matched those on a pair of jogging bottoms discovered on the shoreline near Ardbeg Road. The court was told a number of black polyester and black viscose fibres were identified on the child's vest, shorts and pants. Forensic scientist Sarah Jones said there was ""strong evidence"" the fibres recovered from the clothing at the crime scene came from the component fibres of the grey bottoms. A single polyester fibre from the waistband of a pair of boxer shorts, which were found intertwined with the jogging bottoms, was also discovered on Alesha's shorts, she said. Miss Jones said 18 fibres found on Alesha's vest were found to be ""indistinguishable"" from those on the trousers. The expert also said 36 fibres found on the child's shorts were found to be ""indistinguishable"" from those on the jogging bottoms. A further five fibres found on Alesha's pants were also linked to the trousers. The expert said the only other plausible explanation for was that the fibres came from ""another textile source"" and matched by chance. The six-year-old was staying at her grandparents' house before she disappeared But under cross examination by Brian McConnachie QC, for the accused, the witness said no fibres from a black Nike hooded top were found on Alesha's clothing. The jury previously heard this top was found on the shoreline but ended up in a skip at the back of Rothesay Police Station after an officer deemed it was not relevant to the investigation. The prosecution is expected to conclude its case on Tuesday. The trial, before judge Lord Matthews, continues. It is illegal in Scotland to publish the name, address, school or any other information which could identify anyone under the age of 18 who is the accused, victim or witness in a criminal case This law applies to social media as well as to websites, newspapers and TV and radio programmes. However, the name of victims who have died can be published - so the BBC and other outlets are able to identify Alesha MacPhail. Ahead of their trial, the accused can lodge a special defence such as self-defence (they were defending themselves from attack), alibi (they were somewhere else when the crime was committed) and mental disorder (the accused is not responsible for their actions because they were suffering from a psychiatric condition). In this case, the accused has lodged a special defence of incrimination, which means he has claimed that someone else (Toni McLachlan) was responsible. However, the Crown must still prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt. There is no onus on the accused to prove their special defence is true, and he or she can still be acquitted even if the jury does not believe their special defence.

"NatWest apologised and said it had started disciplinary proceedings against the employee A customer who called a bank to apply for a loan was told ""all vegans should be punched in the face"". The Bristol woman, who did not want to be named, went to NatWest for a loan to pay for a Â£400 nutrition diploma. The application was rejected but after listening to a recording of the call, NatWest offered to pay for the course. The bank said the outburst - which came after the woman told the bank worker she was a vegan - was ""wholly inappropriate"". NatWest also offered the woman compensation of just under Â£200. The woman said after the man told her ""all vegans should be punched in the face"" he explained it was because vegan activists had drawn pictures of animals and written messages such as ""friends not food"" in chalk on pavements near where he lived. The bank worker said he was upset by vegan messages written in chalk on pavements, similar to this one He felt ""vegans were forcing their beliefs on to him"", she added.

"Flybmi won't be the last airline to collapse, analysts say In two short sentences, Flybmi's announcement that it had collapsed summed up the airline industry's woes: fuel costs, green taxes, Brexit uncertainty, falling passenger numbers. It might have added fierce competition, but that is probably a statement of the obvious. Several European airlines have folded or hit financial trouble during the past two years. Britain's Monarch collapsed in October 2017, while Germany's Germania filed for insolvency earlier this month. Air Berlin and Alitalia went bust, although the latter was propped up by the Italian government. Primera, Cobalt, Azurair Germany, Small Planet Airlines and SkyWork may not be household names, but all succumbed to the market turbulence sweeping across the sector. UK regional airline Flybe came close to folding and put itself up for sale. And last month Norwegian Air Shuttle was forced to seek an emergency cash injection, putting a question mark over its promise to revolutionise budget long-haul travel. Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary may beprone to a bit of hyperbole, but when he warned this month that the industry would see more bankruptcies no one doubted him. ""Winter is the worst time of year for airlines,"" says Ascend Consultancy analyst Peter Morris. ""If you can get through the winter there's a chance of getting summer bookings."" Flybmi collapse leaves passengers stranded Flybe will wind up company if sale fails Thomas Cook considers sale of airline Germania airline files for bankruptcy Ryanair posts first loss since 2014 So why are so many airlines failing? Travel expert Simon Calder went to the heart of the problem when he told the BBC that the airline industry's problem is: ""There are simply too many seats and not enough people."" But the reasons for this are many and complex. The growth of airlines in Europe, mainly budget carriers, came on the back of deregulation and an explosion of route networks. Using new and cost-efficient aircraft operators started new services. If one route failed, they tried another. Flexibility was key. According to the International Air Transport Association, the number of flights in Europe has risen more than 40% compared with a decade ago. At the same time, though, fares have fallen, squeezing margins and reducing financial room for manoeuvre. This expansion has not insulated the industry from wider shocks, such as economic slowdown, rising oil prices, and unfavourable exchange rates - the depreciation of sterling has made it more expensive for Britons to go abroad. And there are unexpected extra costs - from traffic control strikes, maintenance bills, bad weather (remember the Beast from the East) and passenger compensation. New EU passenger compensation rules were, said Wizz Air boss JÃ³zsef VÃ¡radi, becoming a real burden on airlines. He cited this, along with fuel costs, as the two biggest squeezes on airline profitability. Oil prices rose and slumped in 2018, and since the start of the year have been on their way back up. Fuel costs have been cited as a factor in almost all the problems reported by airlines in the last couple of years. Cash-strapped Flybe put itself up for sale Flybmi also highlighted another extra cost that did damage - emissions taxes. Tim Jeans, a former managing director of Monarch and chairman of Newquay Cornwall Airport, agrees that it is becoming a serious issue for the whole industry. ""Carbon costs are a creeping cost for all airlines,"" he told the BBC. ""The fees you need to pay to carry out your flying are going up all the time, and they are now quite a material cost."" He thinks many airlines have not fully budgeted for this rise. ""It certainly looks like that is the case with Flybmi,"" he said. There's also the issue of Brexit. Critics say it has become convenient for UK companies to blame uncertainty around Britain leaving the EU for their problems. But for any UK airline - from Flybmi to British Airways - the potential unravelling of Europe's open skies agreement that has existed for decades is a real worry, Mr Jeans says. It will certainly hinder the ability of some airlines to do deals and offer services if there is uncertainty about their freedom to fly across Europe, he said. Ryanair's Michael O'Leary warned of more casualties in the airline industry Mr Morris says problems at International Consolidated Airlines (IAG) underline how Brexit is worrying the major carriers. To retain its operating licence in Europe, IAG, which owns British Airways and Iberia, must show it is more than 50%-owned and controlled by EU investors. So, IAG is capping non-EU investment - except for UK shareholders, who will be counted as part of the EU even after Brexit. It's an example, says Mr Morris, of ""how even the big boys might have some problems with the aviation environment"". Will there be more airline failures? ""Yes, I think definitely,"" says Mr Morris. Airlines that are particularly vulnerable are the smaller carriers squeezed between the major players like BA and Lufthansa, and the big low-cost carriers like Ryanair and Easyjet, Mr Morris says. The former have economies of scale and a presence at major hub airports like Heathrow. The latter operate larger, more efficient aircraft and more regular services, so have lower per-seat costs. It means both sectors can better withstand shocks. Mr Jeans agree. ""Flybmi's demise is a perfect example of just how difficult it is to make money in that middle ground,"" he says.

"Rail operators want fare regulations to change Traditional peak and off-peak rail fares face the axe under sweeping changes being proposed for the UK's train ticketing system. The Rail Delivery Group (RDG), which represents train operators, wants to eliminate the ""cliff edge"" between peak and off-peak prices. It argues that this would reduce overcrowding. Also, tap-in, tap-out rail fares could be expanded beyond London under the proposals published on Monday. The RDG's wish list of reforms is based on some 20,000 submissions on how the UK railways could be improved. Transport Focus, the independent passenger watchdog which also worked on the consultation, said UK train operators currently offered an ""outdated and outmoded fares and ticketing system"". Feedback from commuters found eight out of 10 want the fares system overhauled and nine out of 10 want smart or electronic tickets, with the potential for price capping. Pay-as-you-go fares and daily capping are already used for London commutes The Rail Delivery Group said reforms would support tap-in, tap-out fares - a pay-as-you-go method used in London - and more integration with other modes of transport. In London, tube and rail commuters can use contactless bank cards to automatically pay fares which are calculated based on where a passenger enters and exits the network. Reform would mean updating regulations around peak and off-peak travel, the RDG said, and ticket prices could be set more flexibly. This would reduce overcrowding, it said. Paul Plummer, RDG chief executive, said customers had different needs and wanted changes that offered value and better reflected changing work habits. ""Rail companies are already working together on plans for real world trials so people can see what our proposals could mean for them,"" he said. Rail companies needed the government to change rules on how train fares were charged, he added. ""Current regulation needs to be updated and we want to work with government, which is key to making improvements a reality, to deliver the better fares system the public wants to see."" The vast majority of rail users surveyed wanted changes to train fares The government is currently undertaking the Rail Review which is covering everything from commercial contracts to rail fare structures. Its consultation closes at the end of May. The RDG said its ideas could be rolled out, train operator by train operator, in as little as three years. Darren Shirley, chief executive of the Campaign for Better Transport, said the existing system was ""broken and desperately needs fixing"". ""We're particularly pleased to see proposals for more flexible commuter tickets to reflect modern work patterns, something we've long called for, and for nationwide smart ticketing. ""What's not clear however, is if these proposals will also lead to an end to the annual fares rise, which fails to reflect the level of service passengers receive the previous year. ""It is now up to the government to take forward these proposals to ensure we have a fares system that is fairer and easier to use."" Another proposal is to stop passengers having to buy split tickets to get the cheapest fares for some journeys. Tom Burridge, BBC transport correspondent How to reform the railways is a contentious, some might say politically toxic subject right now. A broad government-commissioned review into almost every aspect of the system is ongoing. Our out-dated and mind-bogglingly complicated ticketing system is a prime candidate for change. The system is, in the eyes of many, inherently flawed. How can an off-peak single sometimes cost a fraction less than a return? And how can it be that you get different prices for exactly the same journey? Technology is clearly a big part of the solution. But a tap-in, tap-out system which automatically ensures you the best fare for your journey is also partly about restoring trust. The t-word has become a precious commodity on the tracks of late, after a whole host of problems. The underlying message from train companies today is that they are on the side of passengers. They want to shunt the government towards positive change. More types of flexible fares is one thing, but cost and who pays will, as always, be almost every passenger's central concern. To make the proposals 'revenue neutral', as the operators plan, cheaper fares would have to be offset by more expensive ones. That is, unless the changes drive more people to travel by train, especially on more empty off-peak services. The initial mood music from those representing passengers is broadly positive. But some fear there could be winners and losers. Even with the support of government, one industry source said real change might not arrive for another three to five years.

The Bristol woman, who did not want to be named, went to NatWest for a loan to pay for a Â£400 nutrition diploma. The application was rejected but after listening to a recording of the call, NatWest offered to pay for the course. The bank said the outburst - which came after the woman told the bank worker she was a vegan - was ""wholly inappropriate"". NatWest also offered the woman compensation of just under Â£200. The woman said after the man told her ""all vegans should be punched in the face"" he explained it was because vegan activists had drawn pictures of animals and written messages such as ""friends not food"" in chalk on pavements near where he lived. The bank worker said he was upset by vegan messages written in chalk on pavements, similar to this one He felt ""vegans were forcing their beliefs on to him"", she added.

"An internet search for ""How do police find DNA"" was allegedly made on a phone said to belong to the 16-year-old accused of murdering Alesha MacPhail. A cybercrime expert told jurors the request was made on Google at 00:32 on 3 July last year, the day after the child's body was discovered. He said the phone was then used to access a How Stuff Works article entitled: ""Collecting DNA evidence"". The accused denies abducting, raping and murdering six-year-old Alesha. The evidence came from cybercrime team leader Peter Benson. It was contained in an 89-page report which was compiled after a forensic examination of an iPhone 6, said to belong to the accused. Alesha accused had 'fantasy' killing chat Alesha, six, had 'catastrophic' injuries Woman denies killing six-year-old Alesha Alesha's father 'sold cannabis to accused' Boy accused of Alesha murder blames woman Alesha's body was found in a wooded area on the Isle of Bute on 2 July last year. The High Court in Glasgow previously heard Alesha suffered 117 injuries and died from significant pressure being applied to her face and neck. She was only days into a summer break in Rothesay when she was killed. The teenager has lodged a special defence claiming the crime was committed by 18-year-old Toni McLachlan, who is the girlfriend of the victim's father. In previous evidence, Ms McLachlan has insisted she had nothing to do with Alesha's death. The court also heard from Det Con Ian Wilson on the sixth day of the trial, who described the accused's response when charged by police. The teenager was arrested on 4 July and was taken to Helen Street police station in Glasgow for a police interview, where he responded ""no comment"" to questions. On being charged with Alesha's murder, he also replied: ""No comment."" The detective said this was not unusual and was within the teenager's rights. Det Con Graham McIlwraith also gave evidence and said he searched the accused's home and noticed one knife missing from a block of five. Shown a photograph of a knife found on the shore opposite where Alesha had been staying, he said it ""would appear to be the same design"" as the Jamie Oliver brand knives found in the accused's house. The jury later heard that fibres found on Alesha's clothing matched those on a pair of jogging bottoms discovered on the shoreline near Ardbeg Road. The court was told a number of black polyester and black viscose fibres were identified on the child's vest, shorts and pants. Forensic scientist Sarah Jones said there was ""strong evidence"" the fibres recovered from the clothing at the crime scene came from the component fibres of the grey bottoms. A single polyester fibre from the waistband of a pair of boxer shorts, which were found intertwined with the jogging bottoms, was also discovered on Alesha's shorts, she said. Miss Jones said 18 fibres found on Alesha's vest were found to be ""indistinguishable"" from those on the trousers. The expert also said 36 fibres found on the child's shorts were found to be ""indistinguishable"" from those on the jogging bottoms. A further five fibres found on Alesha's pants were also linked to the trousers. The expert said the only other plausible explanation for was that the fibres came from ""another textile source"" and matched by chance. The six-year-old was staying at her grandparents' house before she disappeared But under cross examination by Brian McConnachie QC, for the accused, the witness said no fibres from a black Nike hooded top were found on Alesha's clothing. The jury previously heard this top was found on the shoreline but ended up in a skip at the back of Rothesay Police Station after an officer deemed it was not relevant to the investigation. The prosecution is expected to conclude its case on Tuesday. The trial, before judge Lord Matthews, continues. It is illegal in Scotland to publish the name, address, school or any other information which could identify anyone under the age of 18 who is the accused, victim or witness in a criminal case This law applies to social media as well as to websites, newspapers and TV and radio programmes. However, the name of victims who have died can be published - so the BBC and other outlets are able to identify Alesha MacPhail. Ahead of their trial, the accused can lodge a special defence such as self-defence (they were defending themselves from attack), alibi (they were somewhere else when the crime was committed) and mental disorder (the accused is not responsible for their actions because they were suffering from a psychiatric condition). In this case, the accused has lodged a special defence of incrimination, which means he has claimed that someone else (Toni McLachlan) was responsible. However, the Crown must still prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt. There is no onus on the accused to prove their special defence is true, and he or she can still be acquitted even if the jury does not believe their special defence.

"This video can not be played If there's no Wilder rematch 'it's not the end of the world' - Fury British heavyweight Tyson Fury has signed a deal with a United States network worth areported Â£80m.,external The deal, which is understood to cover Fury's next five fights, will see him broadcast on ESPN in the US while remaining on BT Sport in the UK. Fury believes the deal makes a rematch with Deontay Wilder ""more makeable"". But Fury, Wilder and IBF, WBA and WBO champion Anthony Joshua now work with rival US broadcasters, making future negotiations arguably more difficult. Costello & Bunce podcast: Does Fury deal make Wilder rematch more or less likely? Nicola Adams postpones Arely Mucino fight Billy Joe Saunders to face Shefat Isufi in title bout Fury's December drawwith WBC world heavyweight champion Wilder aired on BT Sport in the UK as well as Showtime - who broadcast the American's fights - in the US. Now Fury has his own US broadcaster, agreements will have to be reached between ESPN and Showtime over the airing of a rematch in America. Joshua meanwhile is signed to the DAZN streaming service in the US. Fury's promoter Frank Warren pointed to the size of ESPN's subscription base when he said his fighter was now on ""a bigger platform"". Asked about negotiations for bouts with the division's biggest names, Warren said: ""They will now have to come to us. ""This ESPN situation for him is probably one of the biggest things to happen to a British sportsman. It's something special."" As part of his new deal, Fury will be promoted by both Warren and Top Rank CEO Bob Arum in the US. Arum, 87, has promoted the likes of Muhammad Ali and Floyd Mayweather and said Fury was ""a generational heavyweight talent at the peak of his powers"". BBC Sport boxing correspondent Mike Costello: The deal is an indication of how Tyson Fury's stock has risen in the United States after his performance against Deontay Wilder last December, in particular his dramatic last-round recovery. But the announcement spreads confusion across the heavyweight division when negotiations were underway for the rematch against Wilder. Fury, Wilder and Anthony Joshua are aligned with different TV and streaming partners and doubts have been raised about the chances of big fights being made. Longer term, there could be implications for the golden heavyweight era that many of us were predicting. Fury was expected to sign a deal to face Wilder again, with a date of 18 May mooted and Las Vegas the likely venue. Warren said they still ""wanted"" the contest but quickly added Showtime was no longer ""the only game in town"". ""It's up to us to sit down and get it over the line,"" Warren added. Fury still wants to fight before the end of May and Warren stressed the former WBA, WBO and IBF world heavyweight champion would not ""sit around waiting"". Fury added: ""If I didn't want to fight Wilder then I wouldn't have taken it the first time. The fight is more makeable now because of this deal. ""If you're watching Deontay I'm coming for you baby and this time you won't rip me off. ""If the rematch happens it happens, if it doesn't it doesn't. It isn't the end of the world. I want it to happen so let's make it happen."" This fresh dynamic in negotiations between Fury, Wilder and their broadcasters means talks will have to quickly reach a successful conclusion if a bout in May is to be possible. Joshua will make his own US debut on 1 June in New York when he defends his titles against Jarrell Miller.

"This video can not be played Norway experience: Bottle deposit schemes could help fight plastic pollution Large retailers have been accused of trying to water down a proposed scheme to improve rates of bottle recycling. Environmentalists say large and small drinks containers alike should carry a catch-all deposit of more than 15p. But retailers say only small bottles should be considered because they cause most litter; larger bottles could be exempted because they are mostly recycled at home, they argue. Ministers are still considering which sizes to include in the plans. How do bottle recycling schemes work? The UK proposal, part of the Resources and Waste Strategy,external, is likely to copy one of the schemes adopted in other countries. In Norwayfor instance, the shopper pays a deposit on every bottle - the equivalent of 10p to 25p depending on size. How do bottle deposit schemes work? The consumer drinks the product, then posts the empty bottle into a machine which produces a coupon to return the deposit. This has led to recycling rates of 97% - whereas in the UK just over half of plastic bottles are recycled. Why do green activists insist big and small bottles are targeted? Environmentalists are angry that the industry is still fighting plans to restrict deposits to small bottles. Samantha Harding from the group Campaign to Protect Rural England says the same firms currently attempting to obstruct a deposit scheme managed to kill a similar idea in 1981, when the industry promised to address recycling itself. âBut look at the mess weâre in now,â she said. âConsumption has rocketed while recycling has flat-lined. ""Our countryside, rivers and oceans are choked with plastic. ""And many drinks containers are collected so inefficiently their poor quality means we struggle to recycle them within the UK, and the rest of the world no longer wants them.â Meanwhile, Greenpeace said if the government introduced a âhalf-baked schemeâ limited to smaller bottles only, it would confuse customers and fail to stop millions of large containers being burned, dumped or ending up in the oceans. And Libby Peake from the think tank Green Alliance said litter wasn't the only issue: ""Introducing a deposit on all containers would improve the flow of materials into the recycling stream - that'll be a major plus,"" she told the BBC. She said: ""There are people in the industry who are trying to water down the scheme to restrict it to on-the-go containers - and if they succeed that will definitely make it less efficient."" What does business say? Andrew Opie, of the British Retail Consortium, said the best approach is to focus on cans and bottles drunk outside the home. A catch-all deposit would mean big bottles going into recycling machines rather than home recycling bins, he argued. This would remove a source of revenue for local councils, because plastic bottles are valuable for recycling. He said: âWe all want to see a world with no plastic pollution and high levels of recycling. ""But at a time when many shops are being lost from our high streets, the Resources and Waste Strategy presents business with an additional Â£3bn bill.â Recycling is a devolved issue, and what is being discussed here  strictly affects only England. But ministers in Westminster hope that what emerges from the consultation will help shape approaches across the UK. Wales is actually taking part in the government's consultation - but the Welsh government says it's already the third best place in the world for recycling, so it questions whether a bottle deposit scheme would really be an improvement. Scotland was the first part of the UK to commit to a deposit return scheme which is likely to see all drinks containers - including bottles and cans - having an additional charge of up to 20p, which will then be refunded when the item is returned. A public consultation on the move ended in September last year and the Scottish government has tasked the charity Zero Waste Scotland to work on the design of the scheme. Speaking last month, the Holyrood environment secretary Roseanna Cunningham said she would ""bring forward the next steps on designing our deposit return scheme shortly"", and promised the move would help reduce waste and create jobs. In Northern Ireland, a deposit return scheme is under consideration. So what happens now? Ministers in Westminster have opened formal consultations asking the public and industry which sort of scheme they should support. The consultations will last 12 weeks, and the government will later announce its final policy â decades after deposit return schemes were introduced in other countries. What else is in the waste strategy? The bottle plan is part of a wide-reaching government strategy to change our relationship with waste. One environmentalist said it was âunbelievably radicalâ in some respects. The proposals are: Tackle the recycling postcode lottery under which different materials are recyclable in different areas. Introduce consistent labelling on packaging so consumers know what is recyclable. Make firms responsible for the cost of disposing of the things they sell. This might extend to textiles, fishing gear, tyres, construction waste, mattresses, furniture and carpets. Make companies pay higher fees if their products are harder to reuse, repair or recycle. Force councils tooffer separate collections for food wasteand free garden waste collections. Urge manufacturers to design products that last longer and increase the levels of repair and re-use. Crack down on waste crime by introducing electronic tracking of waste shipments. Havenât we heard all this before? Ministers say their final proposals will be included in a new Environment Bill before the summer holidays. Some of them are not new, but more details emerge at every stage of the drawn-out process. One very intriguing suggestion appears from the latest papers, for instance. The government thinks a well-managed recycling and resources policy can actually make money, rather than costing it.

"This video can not be played Lara Rebecca has started uploading videos online discussing what she has been through Anorexia almost claimed the life of 18-year-old Lara Rebecca but her story of recovery two years later has attracted a massive audience. She uploaded one video to social media about her battle overcoming the eating disorder and it has had almost seven million views in three weeks. Lara, from Cardiff, said she had been a happy child but started restricting her diet as a teenager as a way to cope with her feelings and it became her ""downfall"". ""It was a coping mechanism,"" she said. ""I felt extremely isolated, but it was a sense of control, a way to somehow gain control over my chaotic life at the time. ""The only way I could almost understand these feelings and deal with these feelings and regain the need of a sense of structure was through my eating and, unfortunately, that lead to my downfall to anorexia."" 'I went vegan to hide my eating disorder' Can you talk about self-harm online safely? Instagram makes searching for eating disorders harder Lara said she was admitted to hospital at the age of 16 and her family and doctors feared for her life. She was flown home from a family holiday in order to get treatment. Lara said she had been happy as a child but things changed after she became a teenager ""It was supposed to be a two week holiday to France, and two days in it went from worse to even worse,"" she said. ""I ended up locking myself in the toilets, actually for hours on end, just to cry and as an excuse not to eat. ""I basically starved myself for a very prolonged period of time and it took me to the point where I had to be flown home. ""I was put on the first flight home to the UK and I went into treatment."" When she was most ill, she had a body mass index (BMI) of 13, well below what is considered healthy for a girl of her age. She documented her weight loss with photographs. Lara recorded her condition in photographs ""I remember the mindset I had when I took those photos, and what I saw, and now seeing what is true, it's extremely terrifying,"" she said. ""To think I was so motivated to lose further weight and now I can't even see where I could have lost any further weight. ""It was very scary, very terrifying and now I just want to jump back in time and give myself a hug."" 'Children with anorexia need therapy' 'I stopped eating and was out of control' I was addicted to celebrity diet tea Recovery was slow and incremental over two years but Lara has turned her life around. Over time, her relationship with food has improved and she has started exercising. Now she feels confident and happy. ""I developed a personality back, I was the Lara I always had been rather than this anorexic girl that was really depressed and really anxious. ""So it was socialising and seeing friends and seeing an opportunity to get out of it [that] gave me the motivation."" Lara has always written a blog but, recently, she began uploading videos discussing her recovery and documenting her journey. One film has attracted more than 18,000 comments and she now has more than 50,000 followers. ""I'm lost for words to say the least,"" she said. ""I know where I was and I know how severe depression can get. ""I know how it feels like to be in the darkest pit and you feel like you can never get out of it. ""Sometimes I reflect on it and it's something I can't really comprehend myself. ""But it is certainly a pat on the back moment. I'm very happy.""

"This video can not be played Indian troops patrol the area where the attack took place Nine people, including four Indian soldiers and a policeman, have been killed in Indian-administered Kashmir during a gun battle, police say. The clash occurred in Pulwama, where more than 40 Indian paramilitary police were killed in a bombing last week. That attack, the worst in decades, has fuelled tensions between nuclear-armed India and Pakistan. A civilian and three alleged militants were also among those killed in Monday's confrontation. Police say the three suspected militants who were killed are members of Pakistan-based group Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), which said it was responsible for Thursday's suicide bombing. Why India and Pakistan fight over Kashmir Viewpoint: How far might India go to 'punish' Pakistan? Indians open their homes to Kashmiris Pakistan denies any role in the bombing, but India has accused the state of being complicit. India recalled its top diplomat to the country in the wake of the attack and Pakistan has now also recalled its ambassador from Delhi for consultations. The operation lasted 16 hours on Monday, with heavy gunfire reported as Indian security personnel appealed to villagers to stay indoors. Among the Indian soldiers killed was an army major, police and military officials said. They said another six members of the Indian military were also injured in the battle. The operation targeted a residential area said to be a hideout for suspected militants. What is militant group Jaish-e-Mohammad? Indian security forces have been hunting for those with suspected links to JeM following Thursday's bombing, which saw a vehicle packed with explosives ram a convoy of 78 buses carrying Indian security forces. The suicide bomber was identified as a local Kashmiri aged between 19 and 21. More than 20 people were detained on Sunday, according to police. Kashmir has been a flashpoint between India and Pakistan since independence. Both countries claim all of Muslim-majority Kashmir but control only parts of it. They have fought two wars and a limited conflict in the region. Thursday's attack was the deadliest attack against Indian forces since an Islamist-led insurgency began in 1989. It sparked anti-Pakistan protests in some Indian cities and angry mobs targeted Kashmiri students and businessmen. Mobile internet services in Indian-administered Kashmir were cut over the weekend and the Indian government has pulled security normally provided to at least five Kashmiri separatist leaders. Isolated incidents of students from Kashmir being beaten up or evicted from their accommodation in northern Indian states have also been reported. India's Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) offered help to students in need, but also warned of false reports. Some on Indian social media have been offering their homes to those being targetedin response, using hashtags like #SafeHaven. The funerals driving youth to militancy Injured baby refuels India pellet gun row In broader terms, there has been a spike in violence in Indian-administered Kashmir since Indian forces killed a popular militant in 2016. Significant numbers of young men have joined the insurgency in recent years and the funerals of well-known militants draw huge crowds who want to pay respects to ""martyrs"". India has been accused of using excessive force to control protests with thousands of people suffering eye injuries or being blinded by pellet guns. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is facing an election later this year, has vowed a strong response and says he will give the military free rein. The last time an attack on Indian forces close to this magnitude occurred in Kashmir was in 2016, when 19 soldiers were killed at a base. In response to that,India carried out ""surgical strikes"" which involved Indian soldiers crossing the de facto border to hit Pakistani posts. This video can not be played In December Yogita Limaye examined why there had been a rise in violence in Kashmir This time analysts say heavy snow in the region could make that kind of limited ground response impossible. But there are fears that going further, for example with air strikes, could lead to Pakistani retaliation and a significant escalation. So far India has focused on retaliation by economic and diplomatic means. It has revoked Pakistan's Most Favoured Nation trading status, raised customs duties to 200% and vowed to isolate it in the international community. By Secunder Kermani, BBC Pakistan correspondent The threat of Indian military action has not provoked widespread concern amongst the general public in Pakistan. Previous attacks by militants like JeM, believed to have close links to the intelligence services, have been seen as attempts by the Pakistani military to prevent the civilian government developing too friendly a relationship with India. However, since Imran Khan was elected as prime minister here, many have begun to believe both the army and his administration were united in wanting to improve cross border ties. Whether Pakistan was involved in the attack or not, it seems unlikely concerted action will now be taken against JeM. Its leader has been in ""protective custody"" since another attack in 2016, but still regularly releases audio messages to followers. The group has in the past been a useful tool for Pakistan's intelligence services wanting to foment unrest across the border, and authorities may now be reluctant to confront them, in case they turn against the Pakistani state as some of their members have done in the past.

"This video can not be played ""Terrible. Doom and gloom"" - one worker describes the mood Honda is set to announce the closure of its Swindon car plant in 2022, with the loss of about 3,500 jobs. The Japanese company made 160,000 Honda Civics in Swindon last year, of which some 90% were sold to the UK, Europe and US. Honda has yet to make a formal announcement, and the Prime Minister's spokesman said Theresa May would not comment until an official confirmation. But local MP Justin Tomlinson said he had spoken to Honda, which confirmed it was consulting with ""all staff"". ""There is not expected to be any job losses, or changes in production until 2021,"" Mr Tomlinson said.  3,500total employees in Swindon 160,000Honda Civic cars built annually at the plant 90%of production sold to the UK, Europe and US 1989start of industrial operations Simon Jack: Is Japan losing faith in UK? Nissan Â£60m in doubt after investment U-turn Jaguar Land Rover posts Â£3.4bn loss The Unite union said the reports, if confirmed, would be a ""shattering body blow"". National officer Des Quinn said: ""The car industry in the UK over the last two decades has been the jewel in the crown for the manufacturing sector - and now it has been brought low by the chaotic Brexit uncertainty created by the rigid approach adopted by prime minister Theresa May."" As well as having a ""grave"" impact on workers and their families, it ""will also affect thousands of jobs in the extensive supply chain across the country"", he said. A spokesman for Prime Minister Theresa May said it was ""only right that we wait until the company has spoken with the workforce"" before commenting. The International Trade Secretary, Liam Fox, also declined to comment directly until an official announcement. But he pointed out that car demand had fallen since new diesel emissions rules were introduced across Europe. ""That big drop in demand by consumers is bound to have a knock on effect with producers,"" he said. Martin Huggins, a Honda worker for 25 years said: ""We haven't heard anything at all- all we have seen is what is on our phones. ""The management have told us nothing at all. This will be a sad day for Swindon as a whole, not just the workers but all the subsidiary companies that go with it."" Honda's Swindon plant is based at a former airfield In a tweet, Mr Tomlinson said: ""Honda are clear this is based on global trends and not Brexit, as all European market production will consolidate in Japan in 2021."" The car industry has also been struggling with falling demand in China and a slowdown in diesel sales. Honda's Swindon plant produces both VTEC turbo petrol engines and diesel i-DTEC engines. But according to Sky, Brexit is understood to be one factor in the decision, with the carmaker concerned about the imposition of new tariffs after the UK leaves the EU. Rival Japanese carmakerNissan also cited Brexitas one reason for cancelling plans to build its X-Trail SUV in Sunderland earlier this month. And Toyota and Jaguar Land Rover have expressed concern about the risk of a potential no-deal Brexit in recent months. Last week,Ford warned that a leaving the EU without a deal would be ""catastrophic"". The EU and Japan recently struck a trade deal which lowers tariffs on both parties' car exports to zero. James Atwood, deputy editor of Autocar magazine, said this could be a big factor behind Honda's decision. ""It allows Honda to produce their cars in Japan where most of their plants are and then ship them to the EU without having to pay the import tariffs they have been, which does reduce one of the reasons for needing a plant in the UK,"" he told BBC News. BBC business editor Simon Jack says the trade deal certainly ""means a dwindling rationale to base manufacturing inside the EU"". He said: ""Production at Swindon has been in decline for some time and is currently running at about half its capacity - another strike against it. But, having said that, Japanese companies are very long term investors. ""Sony and Panasonic moved their European headquarters to the EU. In each case, the rationale was slightly different. But many in Japan feel failure to provide Brexit certainty have loosened the ties that used to bind the two countries."" Read more from Simon here Only last autumn, Honda said it was committed to UK-based production regardless of the outcome of Brexit negotiations. But last month, it said it would shut the Swindon factory for six days in April as part of its preparations for any disruption caused post-Brexit. The company said the move was to ensure it could adjust to ""all possible outcomes caused by logistics and border issues"". The firm said it would help in recovering lost production if shipments of parts were held up at borders. Last year, the senior vice-president of Honda Europe warned that if the UK left the EU without a deal, it would cost his company tens of millions of pounds. Ian Howells told the BBC that quitting the bloc without an agreement would affect the carmaker's competitiveness in Europe. Honda UK is situated on a former airfield spanning 370 acres to the north-east of Swindon. The carmaker bought the site in 1985 and established Honda of the UK Manufacturing to inspect vehicles pre-delivery. In 1989, the operations expanded to producing engines. Three years later, a car plant was added, which began producing the Honda Accord. Since then, the site has gone on to produce the Jazz, CR-V, Civic and Type R. A second Honda car plant opened in Swindon in 2001, raising production capacity to 250,000 a year.

"Jeanette Kempton's body was found in rural Suffolk on 18 February 1989 Cold case detectives hope a review of an unsolved 1989 murder could help explain why a woman was killed and then dumped 118 miles (190km) from her home. Jeanette Kempton, 32, went missing from Brixton in south London, where she lived with her ex-husband and their two teenage sons, on 2 February 1989. Her partially decomposed body was found in a ditch at Wangford, near Southwold in Suffolk, just over two weeks later. She had no known links to Suffolk but police said her killer may have had. Andy Guy, Suffolk Police's major crime review and unsolved case manager, said the case was reviewed in 2009 and 2016 and ""could do with another full forensic review"". ""DNA technology has moved on and there are questions I've not got the answers to,"" he said. Two rabbit hunters found Ms Kempton's body on the Earl of Stradbroke's estate Police said Ms Kempton, known as Jean to her friends, was last seen alive leaving The Loughborough Hotel at about 19:15 on 2 February 1989. Her body was found by two rabbit hunters on the Earl of Stradbroke's estate off the A12 on 18 February. She was missing her coat, a shoe, her purse, a wreath for a funeral she had picked up and jewellery. The cause of death was strangulation. Police said there were five suspects at one point, including her ex-husband, but no-one was convicted. There was a Crimewatch appeal in a bid to get more information Mr Guy said: ""She had no connections to Norfolk and Suffolk and was deposited in a ditch totally out of context. ""There were no witnesses and no forensic clues to take you anywhere. ""But there could be someone out there who knows something and that could turn things around very quickly."" He said the person who dumped her body most likely had connections with the north-east Suffolk area. The case featured on BBC One's Crimewatch in May 1989 in an attempt to get more information, but police appeals led to nothing.

"Father-of-three Mr Mundell revealed in 2016 that he was gay Scottish Secretary David Mundell has said coming out as gay was ""one of the most difficult things I've done"". Mr Mundell revealed in January 2016that it was time to ""acknowledge in public as well as in private, who I am"". At the time, the father-of-three was believed to be the first openly-gay Conservative cabinet minister. Mr Mundell, 56, will host a reception in Edinburgh on Thursday to mark LGBT History Month. The MP for Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale said: ""Coming out was one of the most difficult things I have done, but also one of the most important. ""I was overwhelmed by the support I received from friends, family and colleagues."" He added: ""Everyone should feel able to live their lives as they wish, in safety and confidence, without fear of judgment or discrimination. ""We have come a huge way in better rights for our LGBT communities, and LGBT History Month is a valuable reminder of those hard-won achievements. ""But we still have more to do to build a wholly inclusive and accepting society. This month I hope that, by reflecting on our collective history, we continue to pave the way for a fairer future."" Mr Mundell's 2016 announcement took the number of openly-gay MPs in the House of Commons to 33 - one of the highest proportions of any parliament in the world, according to a study by US academics.

Now Fury has his own US broadcaster, agreements will have to be reached between ESPN and Showtime over the airing of a rematch in America. Joshua meanwhile is signed to the DAZN streaming service in the US. Fury's promoter Frank Warren pointed to the size of ESPN's subscription base when he said his fighter was now on ""a bigger platform"". Asked about negotiations for bouts with the division's biggest names, Warren said: ""They will now have to come to us. ""This ESPN situation for him is probably one of the biggest things to happen to a British sportsman. It's something special."" As part of his new deal, Fury will be promoted by both Warren and Top Rank CEO Bob Arum in the US. Arum, 87, has promoted the likes of Muhammad Ali and Floyd Mayweather and said Fury was ""a generational heavyweight talent at the peak of his powers"". BBC Sport boxing correspondent Mike Costello: The deal is an indication of how Tyson Fury's stock has risen in the United States after his performance against Deontay Wilder last December, in particular his dramatic last-round recovery. But the announcement spreads confusion across the heavyweight division when negotiations were underway for the rematch against Wilder. Fury, Wilder and Anthony Joshua are aligned with different TV and streaming partners and doubts have been raised about the chances of big fights being made. Longer term, there could be implications for the golden heavyweight era that many of us were predicting. Fury was expected to sign a deal to face Wilder again, with a date of 18 May mooted and Las Vegas the likely venue. Warren said they still ""wanted"" the contest but quickly added Showtime was no longer ""the only game in town"". ""It's up to us to sit down and get it over the line,"" Warren added. Fury still wants to fight before the end of May and Warren stressed the former WBA, WBO and IBF world heavyweight champion would not ""sit around waiting"". Fury added: ""If I didn't want to fight Wilder then I wouldn't have taken it the first time. The fight is more makeable now because of this deal. ""If you're watching Deontay I'm coming for you baby and this time you won't rip me off. ""If the rematch happens it happens, if it doesn't it doesn't. It isn't the end of the world. I want it to happen so let's make it happen."" This fresh dynamic in negotiations between Fury, Wilder and their broadcasters means talks will have to quickly reach a successful conclusion if a bout in May is to be possible. Joshua will make his own US debut on 1 June in New York when he defends his titles against Jarrell Miller.

House of Commons Speaker John Bercow opened proceedings on Monday by paying tribute to Mr Flynn. ""Paul was a standing rebuke to those who thought it was vital always to be in the closest possible regulatory alignment with one's whips office,"" he said. ""It wasn't."" ""He spoke his mind, he did it his way. He did it with eloquence, with knowledge, with character, and often - as we all know - with mordant wit."" Jayne Bryant, the Welsh Assembly member for Mr Flynn's Newport West constituency, first met the MP when she was nine years old. ""He brought politics alive to me then and has done so ever since,"" she said. ""Respected across the political divide with his wonderful turn of phrase, witty comments and incisive mind - undoubtedly, Paul spoke truth to power."" She told BBC Radio Wales: ""He absolutely loved Newport. He was so proud to represent his constituency. ""He really, really cared for people and I think that sometimes gets lost in politics."" Paul Flynn attracted tributes from party colleagues and opposition MPs alike Conservative Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns said Mr Flynn was an ""exceptional constituency MP"", and said it was a ""privilege to work with him"". Mr Flynn's party colleagues paid tribute to him on Twitter when the news broke late on Sunday night. Cardiff West MP Kevin Brennan said Mr Flynn was a ""passionate pursuer of justice for the least well off"". He added: ""He was a wonderful man who made a huge contribution to Welsh politics."" By Vaughan Roderick, BBC Welsh affairs editor The fight for Welsh-medium education drew Paul Flynn into the political world, Vaughan Roderick said The Welsh language's history in Cardiff has been a long and continuous one, but over the years there have been high and low points. Without doubt the low point came during the middle of the last century. There were thousands of Welsh speakers in the capital, but the language was invisible and the schools more likely to celebrate Empire Day than St David's Day. How likely was it then that a young boy from a poor Catholic family would fall in love with the language? That is exactly what happened to Paul Flynn. Paul was a socialist, a republican, and a hard working peace campaigner, but the fight for Welsh-medium education in Gwent was what drew him into the political world. He thought of himself as a nationalist and Paul was convinced that there was no way to change Wales until the Labour Party changed its attitude towards Welsh nationhood and the language. That battle to begin with was a very lonely one, but over time it was one that he, and others, won. If you want proof of this go to the Dyffryn estate in the constituency. Here you can see the brand new buildings of Ysgol Gyfun Gwent Is Coed, Newport's first Welsh language secondary school. Ysgol Gwent Is Coed in reality is Ysgol Paul Flynn. Newport and the Welsh language has lost one of its giants. Originally published at Cymru Fyw Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"This video can not be played On Monday Shamima Begum told the BBC she never sought to be an IS ""poster girl"" Shamima Begum - the schoolgirl who fled London to join the Islamic State group in Syria - has said she never wanted to be an IS ""poster girl"". Ms Begum, who has just given birth, said she now wants the UK's forgiveness and supports ""some British values"". She told the BBC while it was ""wrong"" innocent people died in the 2017 Manchester attack, it was ""kind of retaliation"" for attacks on IS. The 19-year-old left Bethnal Green four years ago with two school friends. There has been debate about Ms Begum's plight since she wasfound in a Syrian refugee camp by the Times newspaperlast week after reportedly leaving Baghuz, IS's last stronghold in the country. She gave birth to a baby boy last weekend, having previously lost two children, and named him after her first son. While she told the BBC she would have let her late son become an IS fighter, she wants her new baby ""to be British"" and for her to return to the UK with him. IS teenage bride Begum gives birth What can the UK do about the IS teenager? How do countries deal with IS returnees? In an interview with the BBC's Middle East correspondent Quentin Sommerville on Monday, Ms Begum said: ""I don't actually agree with everything they've done. ""I actually do support some British values and I am willing to go back to the UK and settle back again and rehabilitate and that stuff."" Home Secretary Sajid Javid told MPs on Monday that he would not ""hesitate to prevent"" the return of Britons who travelled to Syria to join IS. While the UK cannot leave people stateless, under international law, he said any such Britons would be ""questioned, investigated and potentially prosecuted"". No British troops would be used to help or rescue them, he said. He told MPs that more than 100 dual nationals have already lost their UK citizenship after travelling in support of terrorist groups. ""If you back terror, there must be consequences,"" he said. More than 900 people have left the UK to join the conflict in Syria, said Mr Javid, adding that those who join IS have ""shown they hate our country and the values that we stand for"". Ms Begum was 15 and living in Bethnal Green, London, when she left the UK in 2015 Asked about theManchester Arena attack in 2017in which 22 people - some of them children - were killed in a bombing claimed by IS, she said: ""I was shocked. I didn't know about the kids, actually. I do feel that is wrong. Innocent people did get killed."" She compared the attack to military assaults on Syria, saying: ""It's one thing to kill a soldier, it's fine, it's self-defence. But to kill people like women and children just like the women and children in Baghuz who are being killed right now unjustly by the bombings - it's a two-way thing really because women and children are being killed back in the Islamic State right now. ""It's kind of retaliation. Their justification was that it was retaliation so I thought, okay, that is a fair justification."" Ms Begum said she was sorry for all the families who had lost people because of the attacks in the UK and other countries. ""That wasn't fair on them,"" she said. ""They weren't fighting anyone. They weren't causing any harm. But neither was I and neither were other women who are being killed right now back in Baghuz."" When it was suggested that her going to Syria might have been a ""propaganda victory"" for IS, Ms Begum said: ""I did hear a lot of people were encouraged to come after, but I wasn't the one who put myself on the news."" She added: ""The poster girl thing was not my choice."" Ms Begum said she made the choice to go to Syria and could make her own decisions, despite being only 15 at the time. She said she was partly inspired by videos of fighters beheading hostages and also by videos showing ""the good life"" under IS. She watched videos of the murders of British hostages, she told the BBC, but said she did not know the names of any of the victims. Our correspondent said that ""throughout the interview, Shamima Begum continued to espouse Islamic State philosophy."" He added: ""When I asked her about the enslavement, murder and rape of Yazidi women by IS, she said 'Shia do the same in Iraq'."" But she said: ""I just want forgiveness really, from the UK. Everything I've been through, I didn't expect I would go through that. ""Losing my children the way I lost them, I don't want to lose this baby as well and this is really not a place to raise children, this camp."" Twelve more British women have arrived at the camp in Syria in the last week and more are expected, our correspondent added. This video can not be played Tasnime Akunjee, the lawyer for the family of Shamima Begum, expects her to be ""damaged"" by her ordeal Earlier, the lawyer representing Ms Begum's family said she is ""damaged"" and will need mental health support. Tasnime Akunjee also said her family are prepared to raise her newborn baby away from ""IS thinking"". He said Ms Begum - who is legally British - had still not been in contact with her family and the family are trying to get the government to provide travel documents for Ms Begum and her newborn son, who he said has a right to citizenship. Ms Begum left the UK in February 2015 with two other schoolgirls, Kadiza Sultana and Amira Abase. Kadiza is thought to have died when a house was blown up, and the fate of Amira is unknown. Mr Akunjee also called for an ""urgent inquiry"" into how Ms Begum and the other schoolgirls were able to travel to Syria. Kadiza Sultana, Amira Abase and Shamima Begum (l-r) in photos issued by police Previously, Ms Begum said she escaped from Baghuz, Islamic State's last stronghold in eastern Syria, two weeks ago. Her husband, a Dutch convert to Islam, is thought to have surrendered to a group of Syrian fighters. Under international law, the UK is obliged to let a Briton without the claim to another nationality return home. How do countries deal with IS returnees? After the caliphate: Has IS been defeated? But the government does not have consular staff in Syria, and says it will not risk any lives to help Britons who have joined a banned terrorist group. If Ms Begum is able to reach a British consulate in a recognised country, it is thought security chiefs could ""manage"" her return.

"Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki (L) met Mr Netanyahu in Warsaw this month A summit of central European leaders in Israel has been cancelled because of an Israel-Poland row over the Holocaust. Poland withdrew after being angered by comments from Israeli leaders about Polish complicity in the Holocaust. In particular, Israel's acting Foreign Minister Yisrael Katz used the phrase, ""Poles imbibe anti-Semitism with their mother's milk"". Nazi Germany murdered six million Jews, mostly in Poland. Some Poles did collaborate with the Nazis. Mr Katz's remarks were ""racist and unacceptable"", Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said. There was also Polish fury at Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for saying ""Poles co-operated with the Germans"" during the Holocaust. About six million Polish citizens died in World War Two, of whom about three million were Jews. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The meeting hosted by Israel was meant to bring together the four-nation Visegrad Group: Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia. But on Monday Israel said the three prime ministers attending - without Poland - would have bilateral meetings with Mr Netanyahu. Polish police probe Auschwitz protest Poland U-turn on Holocaust law The Holocaust year by year ""It will not be called Visegrad, because this entails the presence of all four,"" an Israeli spokesperson said. ""It's going to be a summit with Visegrad members."" Auschwitz, 1944: German SS guards carried out industrial-scale murder in occupied Poland The Polish government says its withdrawal is ""an unequivocal signal to other governments and international opinion that historical truth is fundamental"". By BBC Jerusalem correspondent Tom Bateman Mr Netanyahu has spent the last decade in office watching a wave of populist leaders come to prominence around the world. He has often embraced the rise of politicians who - mirroring his own impact on Israeli politics - combined muscular self-interest in foreign policy with attacks on established ""elites"" or the media at home. In the Visegrad Four leaders he saw a potent counterweight within the EU to what he believes is the bloc's anti-Israel stance. But for many critics in Israel this approach was always bound to backfire. They saw him as cosying up to a nationalist government in Poland they believed had tried to diminish the widespread cases of Polish collaboration with the Nazis during the Holocaust. And in the case of Viktor Orban in Hungary - to a leader accused by Jews in his own country of anti-Semitism. There is long-running tension between Poland's conservative government and Israel over the Holocaust. Last year a Polish law made it an offence to allege that the Polish nation was complicit in Nazi crimes. Prime Minister Morawiecki then suggested that some Jews were willing collaborators in the Holocaust, provoking a furious response in Israel. He told a journalist at the Munich Security Conference in February 2018: ""Of course it's not going to be punishable, [it's] not going to be seen as criminal to say that there were Polish perpetrators, as there were Jewish perpetrators, as there were Russian perpetrators, as there were Ukrainian; not only German perpetrators,"" he said. Poles protested outside the Israeli embassy on 15 February On Sunday, Israel's acting Foreign Minister Yisrael Katz said ""Poles imbibe anti-Semitism with their mother's milk"", quoting the late Israeli Prime Minister, Yitzhak Shamir. That in turn enraged Poland, which summoned Israeli ambassador Anne Azari to be warned that Poland could boycott the Visegrad summit. Mr Morawiecki then pulled out, saying of Mr Katz's remarks: ""These words are unacceptable both in diplomatic and public terms. Poles suffered [from Nazi Germany] the most, along with Jews and Roma [Gypsies]."" On Monday Poland withdrew from the summit completely. Research shows that thousands of Poles collaborated with the Nazis; but many other Poles risked their lives to help Jews - a fact recognised by Israel's Yad Vashem remembrance centre. The Nazis built many of their most notorious death camps in Poland after occupying the country at the beginning of the war in 1939. The Polish government argues that for too long Poles have been wrongly linked to crimes committed by Nazi Germany on Polish territory.

"Facebook needs far stricter regulation, with tough and urgent action necessary to end the spread of disinformation on its platform, MPs have said. A Commons committee has concluded,externalthat the firm's founder Mark Zuckerberg failed to show ""leadership or personal responsibility"" over fake news. Untrue stories from foreign powers were risking the UK's democracy, they said. Facebook welcomed the digital select committee's report and said it would be open to ""meaningful regulation"". MPs said that what was needed to deal with the proliferation of disinformation online and the misuse of personal data was a ""radical shift in the balance of power between social media platforms and the people"". The inquiry into fake news, which lasted more than a year, was conducted by the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, with much of the evidence focusing on the business practices of Facebook before and after the Cambridge Analytica scandal. What will the DCMS report achieve? What is fake news and can you identify it? Facebook employs UK fact-checkers to combat fake news Cambridge Analytica was a political advertising firm that had access to the data of millions of users, some of which was allegedly used to psychologically profile US voters. The data was acquired via a personality quiz. How such data, particularly in terms of political campaigning, was shared by Facebook was at the heart of the inquiry, alongside the effects of fake news. ""Democracy is at risk from the malicious and relentless targeting of citizens with disinformation and personalised 'dark adverts' from unidentifiable sources, delivered through the major social media platforms we use every day,"" concluded the report. ""The big tech companies are failing in the duty of care they owe to their users to act against harmful content, and to respect their data privacy rights."" The report called for: a compulsory code of ethics for tech companies, overseen by an independent regulator the regulator to be given powers to launch legal action if companies breach the code the government to reform current electoral laws and rules on overseas involvement in UK elections social media companies to be forced to take down known sources of harmful content, including proven sources of disinformation tech companies operating in the UK to be taxed to help fund the work for the Information Commissioner's Office and any new regulator set up to oversee them. In response, Facebook said: ""We share the committee's concerns about false news and election integrity and are pleased to have made a significant contribution to their investigation over the past 18 months, answering more than 700 questions and with four of our most senior executives giving evidence. ""We are open to meaningful regulation and support the committee's recommendation for electoral law reform. But we're not waiting. We have already made substantial changes so that every political ad on Facebook has to be authorised, state who is paying for it and then is stored in a searchable archive for seven years. No other channel for political advertising is as transparent and offers the tools that we do."" MPs made no secret of the fact that they found it difficult dealing with Facebook during the inquiry and chair Damian Collins had strong words for the firm and its leader, Mr Zuckerberg. ""We believe that in its evidence to the committee, Facebook has often deliberately sought to frustrate our work, by giving incomplete, disingenuous and at time misleading answers to our questions,"" he said. ""These are issues that the major tech companies are well aware of, yet continually fail to address. The guiding principle of the 'move fast and break things' culture seems to be that it is better to apologise than ask permission."" Mark Zuckerberg addressed the US Congress but refused to travel to the UK to speak to MPs MPs were particularly angry that Mr Zuckerberg did not come to the UK to answer questions in person. ""Even if Mark Zuckerberg doesn't believe he is accountable to the UK Parliament, he is to billions of Facebook users across the world,"" said Mr Collins. ""Evidence uncovered by my committee shows he still has questions to answer yet he's continued to duck them, refusing to respond to our invitations directly or sending representatives who don't have the right information."" He also accused Facebook of ""bullying"" smaller tech firms and developers who rely on their platform to reach users. The committee did not list specific examples of fake news. But it pointed to the government response to its interim report, which found at least 38 false narratives online after the nerve agent attack in Salisbury in March 2018. The report also noted that disinformation was not just spread on Facebook but also on platforms such as Twitter. And it found that, in the month following the publication of its interim report, 63% of the views to the online government response were from foreign internet protocol (IP) addresses, more than half of which were from Russia, highly unusual for a UK-based political inquiry. Source:  House of Commons The wide-ranging inquiry did not just look at fake news. It also examined how tech firms use data and data-targeting especially in political contexts, the use of political campaigning online and relationship between a complex network of firms including Canadian AIQ, Cambridge Analytica parent firm SCL and IT firm Six-Four-Three. MPs said current electoral regulations were ""hopelessly out of date for the internet age"" and needed urgent reform, so that the same principles of transparency of political communications that operate in the real world were applied online too. The committee called on the government to reveal how many investigations were currently being carried out into Russian interference in UK politics, particularly the EU referendum in 2016. They asked the government to launch an independent investigation into that. In order to better regulate social media firms, the MPs suggested creating a new category of tech firm - one that was neither a platform nor a publisher but something in-between, which would tighten the legal liability for content identified as harmful. Pressure is mounting on the tech giants to get to grips with the issue of fake news, and will add to calls from other ministers for regulation on the issue of harmful content, following the death of teenager Molly Russell. Her father accused Facebook-owned Instagram of facilitating her death, by failing to remove images of self-harm. And the Cairncross Review into the future of UK news recently recommendeda regulator should oversee Google and Facebookto ensure their news content is trustworthy. In her report, Dame Frances Cairncross said such sites should help users identify fake news and ""nudge people towards news of high quality"". Facebook has repeatedly said it is committed to fighting fake news and works with more than 30 fact-checking organisation around the world. Two of those agencies - Associated Press and Snopes - recently quit working with the social network.

"The cougar was resting on a branch about 50ft (15m) above the ground A very large cat has been rescued from a tree near a property in California after the homeowner saw it while working in the garden, officials say. US firefighters arrived at the property in San Bernardino after the mountain lion - or cougar - was spotted perched on a branch about 50ft (15m) high. The area was then secured and the animal was tranquilised and lowered to the ground using a harness. It was released back into the wild following an assessment by biologists. ""It is common for young mountain lions to wander outside what some would consider normal habitat in an attempt to establish their territory,"" said Kevin Brennan, a biologist with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. Firefighters arrived within minutes to extract the animal The department's warden, Rick Fischer, said that extracting the animal would have been difficult had the firefighters not turned up within several minutes on Saturday afternoon with a ladder. Video: Mountain lion kittens found in US cave Hiker takes on mountain lion in 'wrestling match' What it's like to live in mountain lion country ""Leaving the lion in the tree would not have been safe for the community,external,"" Mr Fischer added in a statement posted on the San Bernardino County Fire Facebook account. The mountain lion was released back into the wild after it regained consciousness Cougars, also known as mountain lions, panthers or pumas, are members of the wild cat family. They live across the Americas, from British Columbia to Argentina. Mountain lion attacks on humans are extremely rare.In North America, for example, fewer than a dozen fatalities have been recorded in more than 100 years,external, according to figures provided by Colorado Parks and Wildlife (CPW). Earlier this month,a man running on a popular park trail in the mountains of northern Colorado killed a mountain lionafter it pounced on him from behind. Allow Twitter content?

"In scope, ambition, likely impact and news value - that is, what it has brought to light - the DCMS Select Committee report on fake news and disinformation is a significant moment. Indeed, when the history of regulation of the technology sector in Britain is written some day, its unlikely path to the top of the best-seller list will owe a substantial debt tothe work of this cross-party group of MPs. Perhaps the strongest line to emerge is the claim that Facebook ""intentionally and knowingly violated both data privacy and anti-competition laws"". This is a striking thing to allege, and creates the potential for strong legal sanction. Of course, Facebook will resist such allegations with customary vigour. In this blog, I will analyse some of the key areas on which the select committee has reported. Select committee sessions used to be more genteel affairs, with civility and good manners to the fore. The incursion of television cameras, and the collapse of many other traditional forms of democratic scrutiny (including the refusal of many politicians to do sit-down interviews on TV) have changed all that, giving them spice and influence they previously lacked. This inquiry got testy at times - particularly because of the unconventionally brazen approach of Brexit donor Arron Banks and his associate Andy Wigmore (more of which below). There was also heat because of Mark Zuckerberg's refusal to show up, despite repeated invitations, which angered the committee. Their assessment of Facebook's failings is unsparing and brutal. They say the company was willing to ""override its users' privacy settings in order to transfer data to some app developers"". This is eerily redolent of the central charge in the Cambridge Analytica scandal, where the data of tens of millions of users ended up with an academic who wasn't supposed to have such access. If it is true that Facebook registered the privacy settings of some users but was willing to ""override"" them, that would be a grave matter, and indicate a fundamental breach of trust. Facebook will therefore want to prove the allegation is false swiftly. Facebook's head of UK public policy said: ""We share the committee's concerns about false news and election integrity and are pleased to have made a significant contribution to their investigation over the past 18 months, answering more than 700 questions and with four of our most senior executives giving evidence."" The committee also says that in charging ""high prices in advertising to some developers, for the exchange of data, and starv[ing] other developers... contributing to them losing their business"", Facebook was acting in an anti-competitive way. This goes to the heart of Facebook's business model - and extraordinary economic power. Facebook always insists it doesn't sell user data. But the astonishing technology Mark Zuckerberg pioneered paints a digital target on users by analysing their behaviour, predicting future behaviour and sharing aspects of this analysis with advertisers who want to target particular groups. The scandals of recent years have made the public much more aware of how this is happening. This report will fortify public awareness of the core transaction between Facebook and its users - one the company has been more open about in recent times, by the way, while also becoming much more transparent in sharing information with users. Ah, transparency. Up to a point, Lord Copper. It was a senior civil servant at the Home Office who used the phrase ""not fit for purpose"" about that department, but when Labour's John Reid deployed it, it became common parlance. The select committee deploys this phrase in reference to electoral law and political advertising. Clear micro-targeting of voters, of the kind deployed in US presidential elections from 2008 until now, and also in the Brexit referendum, brings with it the profound danger that people outside a polity can interfere in an election. The extent of Russian interference in the election of Trump is currently being investigated. This committee wants an independent investigation into similar influence here. And it makes plain the fact that current electoral law is too weak at dealing with this new threat. The recommendation for a new legal definition of digital campaigning and online political advertising is an attempt to wrench laws pertaining to electoral advertising from the era of leaflets and billboards to that of Facebook and Twitter. It is obvious such a wrench is necessary. It is not obvious what that new legal definition will be, because advertising and messaging come in an almost infinite number of forms. With exquisite timing, Brittany Kaiser, a former employee of the British data firm that collapsed last year, has been subpoenaed by the Mueller Inquiry. Kaiser appeared alongside Arron Banks at the launch of Leave.EU, the alternative Brexit campaign set up by the UKIP donor. The relationship between Banks and the committee has turned nasty. Banks is openly attacking the chairman, Damian Collins MP, in his constituency, and released a sarcastic response to the report yesterday. There are inquiries already under way, by the Electoral Commission and National Crime Agency, into Banks's finances and the origin of his donation. Banks denies all wrongdoing. This final report doesn't go much further than it did at the interim stage in criticising Banks, but it does repeat calls for further investigation (by the National Crime Agency) of SCL Elections, a company to which Cambridge Analytica was associated. Most significantly, the report notes that many of the individuals and practices found in SCL Elections and its associates have reformed under new corporate structures, including Emerdata Ltd. Will a few companies based mostly around San Francisco obey, and take seriously, a code of ethics set up by Britain? This recommendation in the report, which is close to that made by Dame Frances Cairncross in her recent review of the future of high-quality news, derives force from the suggestion that any such code should be overseen by an independent regulator. If regulation of the internet were easy, it would have happened a while ago. Regulation is slow and consensual; it is the very nature of technological innovation that it is fast and unpredictable. Is this a new regulator - Ofnet? Or is it part of an old one - Ofcom? I don't think Ofcom are too keen. What will it regulate? Social media? OK - is Snapchat social media? They say they're a camera and communication company. What about a platform for OAPs in the Swindon area set up by a local computer whizz? Will that be subject to the same rules as Facebook? And how do you keep up with the volume of content generated by two billion users? None of which is in any way to argue against regulation, of course. I have read the relevant section of the report twice. On page 14, under points 31 and 32, there is reference to the views of Sharon White, CEO of Ofcom, about what could be learned from broadcasting regulation. Under point 34, on page 15, there is also the suggestion of Guy Parker, CEO of the Advertising Standards Authority, that the government could decide online harms should be added to the purview of his organisation. The report then alights on the notion that a body called the UK Council for Internet Safety - of which Facebook is a member - could, perhaps, expand its remit to consider the ""risk to democracy"". Of all the sections of the report, this seems to me to be the area that is still not fully developed. There is extensive detail on what a new code of ethics would look like, but the granular particulars of what counts as a ""tech company"", and what the definition of ""harm"" is, remain unclear. Again, that is not to argue against regulation, merely to point out the great difficulties. Put together with the recommendations of the Cairncross Review and a recent speech by Labour's Tom Watson, this report shows that we are entering a new era in the relationship between technology and the law - but we don't know what it looks like yet. The committee has done some significant intellectual heavy lifting, and applied scrutiny to companies and individuals who often evade it. But such is the nature of digital technology that really this marks neither the beginning nor the end, but rather the end of the beginning, of a conversation between legislators, technologists and the public about how to put the astonishing power of these innovations to better use. In other words, how to shift power from Big Tech back to citizens. Which, after all, is what Big Tech always claimed to be about.

"This video can not be played Dame Frances Cairncross explains the findings of her review into the future of the UK news industry A regulator should oversee tech giants like Google and Facebook to ensure their news content is trustworthy, a government-backed report has suggested. The Cairncross Review into the future of UK news said such sites should help users identify fake news and ""nudge people towards news of high quality"". The review also said Ofcom should assess the BBC's impact on online news on other providers. In addition, the report called for a new Institute for Public Interest News. Such a body, it said, could work in a similar way to the Arts Council, channelling public and private funding to ""those parts of the industry it deemed most worthy of support"". Last local paper closes, so ring MP for news Amol Rajan's media predictions for 2019 Governments v social media The report said Facebook and Google need to give more prominence to public interest news The independent review, undertaken by former journalist Dame Frances Cairncross, was tasked with investigating the sustainability of high-quality journalism. Its recommendations include measures to tackle ""the uneven balance of power"" between news publishers and online platforms that distribute their content. Services such as Facebook, Google and Apple should continue their attempts to help readers understand how reliable a story is, and the process that decides which stories are shown should be more transparent, it says. ""Their efforts should be placed under regulatory scrutiny - this task is too important to leave entirely to the judgment of commercial entities,"" according to the report. Could a digital regulator stop the spread of so-called 'fake news'? A regulator would initially only assess how well these sites are performing - but if this doesn't work, the report warns ""it may be necessary to impose stricter provisions"". Yet the report falls short of requiring Facebook, Google and other tech giants to pay for the news they distribute via their platforms. Dame Frances told the BBC's media editor Amol Rajan that ""draconian and risky"" measures could result in firms such as Google withdrawing their news services altogether. ""There are a number of ways we have suggested technology companies could behave differently and could be made to behave differently,"" she said. ""But they are mostly ways that don't immediately involve legislation."" The review was not asked to comment specifically on the BBC but concluded that curtailing the corporation's news offering would be counter-productive after hearing arguments from other publishers that the BBC reporting on so-called ""soft content"" online was crowding out other news providers. The review noted that the BBC Charter states the corporation should endeavour to reach all demographics, and that stories of this type are essential to appeal to an increasingly elusive younger audience. The BBC also argues that ""soft content"" stories may attract users who might then click onwards to a public-interest news story. The review said the BBC was delivering high quality journalism but suggested it ""could do more and think more carefully about how its news provision can act as a complement, rather than a substitute, for private news provision"". Dame Frances also recommended an exploration of the market impact of BBC News, conducted by broadcasting regulator Ofcom, to find whether it is 'striking the right balance' and driving traffic to other, commercial providers. The BBC should do more to share its technical and digital expertise for the benefit of local publishers, the report concluded. The review suggests it would 'make little sense to curtail the BBC' Shadow Culture Secretary Tom Watson urged the government to tackle Google and Facebook's ""duopoly"" in the digital advertising market, and said Dame Frances was ""barking up the wrong tree"" in recommending an inquiry into the BBC's online news output. Meanwhile, former director general of the BBC Greg Dyke defended the role of the corporation. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""It seems to me that at a time when large American media companies - the likes of Netflix and the rest of it - are going to come to dominate in the world, for the BBC to be cutting back on anything will be a mistake. ""The importance of the BBC is going to grow in the next 10 years, not decline."" Frances Cairncross earned widespread respect as a journalist for her hard-headed and pragmatic approach to economics. That pragmatism is the very reason the government commissioned her to look at the future of high-quality news - and also the reason many in local and regional media will be disappointed by her recommendations. What is most notable about her review is what it doesn't do. It doesn't suggest all social media should be regulated in the UK It doesn't suggest social media companies pay for the privilege of using news content It doesn't suggest social media companies be treated as publishers, with legal liability for all that appears on their platform This is because the practicalities of doing these things are difficult, and experience shows that the likes of Google will simply pull out of markets that don't suit them. There are concrete measures that could boost local news, from tax relief to an extension of the Local Democracy Reporting Service. And Dame Frances certainly seemed cognisant of the argument that BBC News has over-reached, to the extent that it is harming the commercial sector. But this is a matter for Ofcom. Ultimately, as this report acknowledges, when it comes to news, convenience is king. The speed, versatility and zero cost of so much news now means that, even if it is of poor quality, a generation of consumers has fallen out of the habit of paying for news. But quality costs. If quality news has a future, consumers will have to pay. That's the main lesson of this report. The report recommends ""new codes of conduct"" whose implementation would be supervised by a regulator ""with powers to insist on compliance"". Other recommendations included: Tax relief to encourage the provision of local journalism Expanding financial support for local news by extending the BBC'sLocal Democracy Reporting Service An investigation of the online advertising market, conducted by the Competition and Markets Authority, to ensure fair competition The Barnsley Chronicle goes to press in September 2017 One local newspaper editor welcomed the report's recommendations but said it ""comes too late for so many once proud and important community newspapers"". The Yorkshire Post's James Mitchinson said: ""The various fiscal reviews and recommendations... must come quickly... if we are to turn the Cairncross Review into something which we look back upon as being instrumental in preserving what we do for generations to come."" Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright said some of its suggestions could be acted upon ""immediately"", while others would need ""further careful consideration"".

"A small group of MPs look set to announce their resignations from Labour, senior party sources have said. At least four backbenchers who disagree with the Labour leadership over its handling of Brexit and anti-Semitism are thought likely to break away. They are announcing the formation of a new group in Parliament - the Independent Group. Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson urged those thinking of quitting to ""stay and fight their corner"". ""That is what political parties are,"" he told BBC Hereford and Worcester. ""They are democratic spaces for people to win arguments."" He said he had been ""hearing rumours of a splinter for about a year now"". Could Brexit cause a Labour split? MP Smith 'considering' quitting Labour Shadow cabinet clash over anti-Semitism Labour unity call amid split rumours Anger over the leadership's refusal to get behind calls for another EU referendum, combined with dismay at its handling of anti-Semitism allegations, have led so-called ""moderate"" MPs already disillusioned with Mr Corbyn's leadership, to consider their future. An event mid-morning concerning the future of British politics can mean only one thing - that after months of mounting worry and concern, some of Labour's backbenchers have made the major decision to leave their party. This doesn't necessarily mean they are about to unveil a new party, and it doesn't necessarily mean that the group will be able to sway much power. This morning's event may see only four or five MPs announce their decision. But it seems that the divisions in the Labour Party could not be contained. Many of Jeremy Corbyn's MPs have long been convinced that the party should be much more enthusiastically campaigning for another referendum on staying in the EU. But those leaving later also have broader fears about the nature of his leadership and the pace at which Labour has dealt with anti-Semitism. The group set to depart may be small, but they are not the only ones inside the Labour Party who hold major concerns. Read more from Laura here. Last week, former shadow chancellor Chris Leslie said it was ""heartbreaking"" that Labour was not united in arguing against leaving the EU, adding: ""I certainly think we are being played for fools by the leadership of the Labour Party."" Chris Leslie, Owen Smith, Chuka Umunna and other Labour supporters of the People's Vote campaign for another EU referendum have been linked with rumours of a split for some time - Mr Smith told the BBC last week that he was considering his future in the party. A row over the treatment of Liverpool Wavertree MP Luciana Berger - an outspoken critic of Mr Corbyn's handling of anti-Semitism and Brexit, who had been threatened with a no confidence vote by local party activists - has sparked a fresh round of in-fighting at the top of the party. Tom Watson said he wanted ""all members of the Labour Party feel welcome in our democratic structures"" and he claimed there had been ""bullying"" by some activists in Liverpool Wavertree - something that has been denied by the branch's leadership. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said on Sundayhe did not see ""any need for anybody to split from the party"". ""Those saying we'll split if we don't get a 'People's Vote' [another referendum on the final Brexit deal] - well, we've still kept that option on the table and it might come about,"" he added. Mr McDonnell insisted the party was ""holding together on Brexit"" and would be ""ruthless"" onclaims of anti-Semitismthat have plagued Labour. This video can not be played Labour split 'would be like 1980s' - John McDonnell He said the effect of MPs splintering from the party would be similar to the SDP breakaway in 1981, which split Labour's vote and ""installed Mrs Thatcher in power for a decade"".

"Facebook needs far stricter regulation, with tough and urgent action necessary to end the spread of disinformation on its platform, MPs have said. A Commons committee has concluded,externalthat the firm's founder Mark Zuckerberg failed to show ""leadership or personal responsibility"" over fake news. Untrue stories from foreign powers were risking the UK's democracy, they said. Facebook welcomed the digital select committee's report and said it would be open to ""meaningful regulation"". MPs said that what was needed to deal with the proliferation of disinformation online and the misuse of personal data was a ""radical shift in the balance of power between social media platforms and the people"". The inquiry into fake news, which lasted more than a year, was conducted by the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, with much of the evidence focusing on the business practices of Facebook before and after the Cambridge Analytica scandal. What will the DCMS report achieve? What is fake news and can you identify it? Facebook employs UK fact-checkers to combat fake news Cambridge Analytica was a political advertising firm that had access to the data of millions of users, some of which was allegedly used to psychologically profile US voters. The data was acquired via a personality quiz. How such data, particularly in terms of political campaigning, was shared by Facebook was at the heart of the inquiry, alongside the effects of fake news. ""Democracy is at risk from the malicious and relentless targeting of citizens with disinformation and personalised 'dark adverts' from unidentifiable sources, delivered through the major social media platforms we use every day,"" concluded the report. ""The big tech companies are failing in the duty of care they owe to their users to act against harmful content, and to respect their data privacy rights."" The report called for: a compulsory code of ethics for tech companies, overseen by an independent regulator the regulator to be given powers to launch legal action if companies breach the code the government to reform current electoral laws and rules on overseas involvement in UK elections social media companies to be forced to take down known sources of harmful content, including proven sources of disinformation tech companies operating in the UK to be taxed to help fund the work for the Information Commissioner's Office and any new regulator set up to oversee them. In response, Facebook said: ""We share the committee's concerns about false news and election integrity and are pleased to have made a significant contribution to their investigation over the past 18 months, answering more than 700 questions and with four of our most senior executives giving evidence. ""We are open to meaningful regulation and support the committee's recommendation for electoral law reform. But we're not waiting. We have already made substantial changes so that every political ad on Facebook has to be authorised, state who is paying for it and then is stored in a searchable archive for seven years. No other channel for political advertising is as transparent and offers the tools that we do."" MPs made no secret of the fact that they found it difficult dealing with Facebook during the inquiry and chair Damian Collins had strong words for the firm and its leader, Mr Zuckerberg. ""We believe that in its evidence to the committee, Facebook has often deliberately sought to frustrate our work, by giving incomplete, disingenuous and at time misleading answers to our questions,"" he said. ""These are issues that the major tech companies are well aware of, yet continually fail to address. The guiding principle of the 'move fast and break things' culture seems to be that it is better to apologise than ask permission."" Mark Zuckerberg addressed the US Congress but refused to travel to the UK to speak to MPs MPs were particularly angry that Mr Zuckerberg did not come to the UK to answer questions in person. ""Even if Mark Zuckerberg doesn't believe he is accountable to the UK Parliament, he is to billions of Facebook users across the world,"" said Mr Collins. ""Evidence uncovered by my committee shows he still has questions to answer yet he's continued to duck them, refusing to respond to our invitations directly or sending representatives who don't have the right information."" He also accused Facebook of ""bullying"" smaller tech firms and developers who rely on their platform to reach users. The committee did not list specific examples of fake news. But it pointed to the government response to its interim report, which found at least 38 false narratives online after the nerve agent attack in Salisbury in March 2018. The report also noted that disinformation was not just spread on Facebook but also on platforms such as Twitter. And it found that, in the month following the publication of its interim report, 63% of the views to the online government response were from foreign internet protocol (IP) addresses, more than half of which were from Russia, highly unusual for a UK-based political inquiry. Source:  House of Commons The wide-ranging inquiry did not just look at fake news. It also examined how tech firms use data and data-targeting especially in political contexts, the use of political campaigning online and relationship between a complex network of firms including Canadian AIQ, Cambridge Analytica parent firm SCL and IT firm Six-Four-Three. MPs said current electoral regulations were ""hopelessly out of date for the internet age"" and needed urgent reform, so that the same principles of transparency of political communications that operate in the real world were applied online too. The committee called on the government to reveal how many investigations were currently being carried out into Russian interference in UK politics, particularly the EU referendum in 2016. They asked the government to launch an independent investigation into that. In order to better regulate social media firms, the MPs suggested creating a new category of tech firm - one that was neither a platform nor a publisher but something in-between, which would tighten the legal liability for content identified as harmful. Pressure is mounting on the tech giants to get to grips with the issue of fake news, and will add to calls from other ministers for regulation on the issue of harmful content, following the death of teenager Molly Russell. Her father accused Facebook-owned Instagram of facilitating her death, by failing to remove images of self-harm. And the Cairncross Review into the future of UK news recently recommendeda regulator should oversee Google and Facebookto ensure their news content is trustworthy. In her report, Dame Frances Cairncross said such sites should help users identify fake news and ""nudge people towards news of high quality"". Facebook has repeatedly said it is committed to fighting fake news and works with more than 30 fact-checking organisation around the world. Two of those agencies - Associated Press and Snopes - recently quit working with the social network. The ease with which fake news can be created was illustrated recently by a team of researchers at OpenAi which showed a machine learning system produce coherent, but untrue articles, just by trawling through news site Reddit.

"Australia's parliament was the subject of an attempted hack Australia's main political parties and parliament were hit by a ""malicious intrusion"" on their computer networks, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said. The cyber-attack revealed two weeks ago was carried out by a ""sophisticated state actor"", he said. But he added there was ""no evidence of any electoral interference"". The nation will hold an election within months. The attack being investigated was at first thought to involve only the parliament's servers. ""During the course of this work, we also became aware that the networks of some political parties - Liberal, Labor and Nationals - have also been affected,"" Mr Morrison told the House of Representatives on Monday. The Australian prime minister did not say which foreign state was under suspicion, adding he would not provide additional detail on ""operational matters"". The Australian government has faced a number of cyber-attacks in recent years, some of which have been attributed in local media to nations such as China. Fergus Hanson, cyber security expert at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, put China ""at the top"" of the list of suspects but said he ""wouldn't rule out"" Russia also being responsible. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said the accusations were ""groundless"" and ""made up out of thin air with ulterior motives"". He urged media organisations to ""stop the words and actions"" that can harm ""China's bilateral relations with relevant countries"". The Australian Cyber Security Centre said that although party systems had been compromised, it was not yet known if information had been stolen. Mr Morrison, who leads the Liberal-National coalition, said: ""We have put in place a number of measures to ensure the integrity of our electoral system."" He added that security officials had briefed the nation's electoral bodies and would provide support to all political parties. Mass data attack on German politicians China denies Australia weather 'hack' Australia defence data in 'extensive' hack Labor leader Bill Shorten said the cyber-attack was ""of grave concern"" following instances of ""malicious activity"" in other nations. ""We cannot be complacent and, as this most recent activity reported by the prime minister indicates, we are not exempt or immune,"" he said. In 2015 and 2016, there were high-profile attacks on the government's weather and statistics agencies. In 2011,senior Australian ministers also had their email systems breached. After the attack on the parliament's computer network, officials said there was ""no evidence"" that information had been accessed or stolen. However, politicians' passwords had been reset as a precaution.

"Father-of-three Mr Mundell revealed in 2016 that he was gay Scottish Secretary David Mundell has said coming out as gay was ""one of the most difficult things I've done"". Mr Mundell revealed in January 2016that it was time to ""acknowledge in public as well as in private, who I am"". At the time, the father-of-three was believed to be the first openly-gay Conservative cabinet minister. Mr Mundell, 56, will host a reception in Edinburgh on Thursday to mark LGBT History Month. The MP for Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale said: ""Coming out was one of the most difficult things I have done, but also one of the most important. ""I was overwhelmed by the support I received from friends, family and colleagues."" He added: ""Everyone should feel able to live their lives as they wish, in safety and confidence, without fear of judgment or discrimination. ""We have come a huge way in better rights for our LGBT communities, and LGBT History Month is a valuable reminder of those hard-won achievements. ""But we still have more to do to build a wholly inclusive and accepting society. This month I hope that, by reflecting on our collective history, we continue to pave the way for a fairer future."" Mr Mundell's 2016 announcement took the number of openly-gay MPs in the House of Commons to 33 - one of the highest proportions of any parliament in the world, according to a study by US academics.

"Huawei has said it is independent and gives nothing to Beijing, aside from taxes Any risk posed by involving the Chinese technology giant Huawei in UK telecoms projects can be managed, cyber-security chiefs have determined. The UK's National Cyber Security Centre's decision undermines US efforts to persuade its allies to ban the firm from 5G communications networks. The Chinese government is accused of using Huawei as a proxy so it can spy on rival nations. But Huawei has said it gives nothing to Beijing, aside from taxes. Why Huawei matters in five charts Should we worry about Huawei? Ren Zhengfei: Huawei's reclusive founder Australia, New Zealand, and the US have already banned Huawei from supplying equipment for their future fifth generation mobile broadband networks, while Canada is reviewing whether the company's products present a serious security threat. Most of the UK's mobile companies - Vodafone, EE and Three - have been working with Huawei on developing their 5G networks. They are awaiting on a government review, due in March or April, that will decide whether they can use Huawei technology. As first reported by the Financial Times, the conclusion by the National Cyber Security Centre - part of the intelligence agency GCHQ - will feed into the review. The decision has not yet been made public, but the security agency said in a statement it had ""a unique oversight and understanding of Huawei engineering and cyber security"". Huawei has denied that it poses any risk to the UK or any other country BBC business correspondent Rob Young said the National Cyber Security Centre's conclusion ""will carry weight"", but said the review could still rule against Huawei. In an interview, Huawei's cyber security chief John Suffolk told the BBC: ""We are probably the most open and transparent organisation in the world. We are probably the most poked and prodded organisation too."" The former UK chief information officer added: ""We don't say 'believe us' we say 'come and check for yourself', come and do your own testing and come and do your own verification. ""The more people looking, the more people touching, they can provide their own assurance without listening to what Huawei has to say."" Rory Cellan-Jones, technology correspondent If anybody knows just how Huawei works and the threat it might pose to the UK's security, it is the National Cyber Security Centre. This arm of GCHQ has been in charge of an annual examination of the Chinese telecoms giant's equipment, and expressed concerns in its most recent report - not about secret backdoors, but sloppy cyber-security practices. The NCSC has also been giving advice to UK mobile operators as they order the equipment for the rollout of their 5G networks later this year. They feel they have been given the same cautious nod the agency appears to have given the government's Supply Chain Review: keep Huawei out of the core of your 5G networks, but you are OK to use its equipment at phone masts as part of the mix of suppliers. Australia and New Zealand have taken a very different view by taking a far harder line against Huawei. That isn't because they know something about the Chinese firm which the NCSC has missed. Their decisions were probably based on an assessment of the political as well as security risk of ignoring the urging from the US to shut Huawei out. And whatever the NCSC's advice, similar factors will determine the UK government's final decision. A spokesperson for the Department of Culture, Media and Sport, which is leading the review into the future of the telecoms industry, said its analysis was ""ongoing"". ""No decisions have been taken and any suggestion to the contrary is inaccurate,"" they said in a statement. Huawei and 5G: Decision time Timeline: What's going on with Huawei? The Inquiry: What's so scary about Huawei? Asked whether the findings changed her country's stance towards Huawei, the prime minister of New Zealand - which is a member of the Five Eyes intelligence sharing network that includes the UK - said her government would conduct its own assessment. Jacinda Ardern told reporters: ""It is fair to say Five Eyes, of course, share information, but we make our own independent decisions."" Last year, BT confirmed that it was removing Huawei's equipment from the EE core network that it owns. The network provides a communication system being developed for the UK's emergency services. Fifth-generation mobile broadband is coming to the UK over the next year or so,promising download and browsing speeds 10 to 20 times faster than those 4G networks can offer. This video can not be played Will superfast 5G mobile be worth the money? The US argues Huawei could use malign software updates to spy on those using 5G. It points to China's National Intelligence Law passed in 2017 that says organisations must ""support, co-operate with and collaborate in national intelligence work"". Critics of Huawei also highlight that its founder Ren Zhengfei was a former engineer in the country's army and joined the Communist Party in 1978. Huawei recently attracted attention when its chief financial officer,Meng Wanzhou, was arrested and accused of breaking American sanctions on Iran.

"Rail operators want fare regulations to change Traditional peak and off-peak rail fares face the axe under sweeping changes being proposed for the UK's train ticketing system. The Rail Delivery Group (RDG), which represents train operators, wants to eliminate the ""cliff edge"" between peak and off-peak prices. It argues that this would reduce overcrowding. Also, tap-in, tap-out rail fares could be expanded beyond London under the proposals published on Monday. The RDG's wish list of reforms is based on some 20,000 submissions on how the UK railways could be improved. Transport Focus, the independent passenger watchdog which also worked on the consultation, said UK train operators currently offered an ""outdated and outmoded fares and ticketing system"". Feedback from commuters found eight out of 10 want the fares system overhauled and nine out of 10 want smart or electronic tickets, with the potential for price capping. Pay-as-you-go fares and daily capping are already used for London commutes The Rail Delivery Group said reforms would support tap-in, tap-out fares - a pay-as-you-go method used in London - and more integration with other modes of transport. In London, tube and rail commuters can use contactless bank cards to automatically pay fares which are calculated based on where a passenger enters and exits the network. Reform would mean updating regulations around peak and off-peak travel, the RDG said, and ticket prices could be set more flexibly. This would reduce overcrowding, it said. Paul Plummer, RDG chief executive, said customers had different needs and wanted changes that offered value and better reflected changing work habits. ""Rail companies are already working together on plans for real world trials so people can see what our proposals could mean for them,"" he said. Rail companies needed the government to change rules on how train fares were charged, he added. ""Current regulation needs to be updated and we want to work with government, which is key to making improvements a reality, to deliver the better fares system the public wants to see."" The vast majority of rail users surveyed wanted changes to train fares The government is currently undertaking the Rail Review which is covering everything from commercial contracts to rail fare structures. Its consultation closes at the end of May. The RDG said its ideas could be rolled out, train operator by train operator, in as little as three years. Darren Shirley, chief executive of the Campaign for Better Transport, said the existing system was ""broken and desperately needs fixing"". ""We're particularly pleased to see proposals for more flexible commuter tickets to reflect modern work patterns, something we've long called for, and for nationwide smart ticketing. ""What's not clear however, is if these proposals will also lead to an end to the annual fares rise, which fails to reflect the level of service passengers receive the previous year. ""It is now up to the government to take forward these proposals to ensure we have a fares system that is fairer and easier to use."" Another proposal is to stop passengers having to buy split tickets to get the cheapest fares for some journeys. Tom Burridge, BBC transport correspondent How to reform the railways is a contentious, some might say politically toxic subject right now. A broad government-commissioned review into almost every aspect of the system is ongoing. Our out-dated and mind-bogglingly complicated ticketing system is a prime candidate for change. The system is, in the eyes of many, inherently flawed. How can an off-peak single sometimes cost a fraction less than a return? And how can it be that you get different prices for exactly the same journey? Technology is clearly a big part of the solution. But a tap-in, tap-out system which automatically ensures you the best fare for your journey is also partly about restoring trust. The t-word has become a precious commodity on the tracks of late, after a whole host of problems. The underlying message from train companies today is that they are on the side of passengers. They want to shunt the government towards positive change. More types of flexible fares is one thing, but cost and who pays will, as always, be almost every passenger's central concern. To make the proposals 'revenue neutral', as the operators plan, cheaper fares would have to be offset by more expensive ones. That is, unless the changes drive more people to travel by train, especially on more empty off-peak services. The initial mood music from those representing passengers is broadly positive. But some fear there could be winners and losers. Even with the support of government, one industry source said real change might not arrive for another three to five years.

"Ms Begum was 15 and living in Bethnal Green, London, when she left the UK in 2015 Shamima Begum, one of three teenage girls to flee east London for a new life with the Islamic State group, says she has given birth to a baby boy. Ms Begum left four years ago aged 15. Found in a Syrian refugee camp last week, she now hopes to return home. The 19-year-old told Sky News: ""People should have sympathy towards me for everything I've been through."" Under international law, the UK is obliged to let a Briton without the claim to another nationality back in. Asked if she had made a mistake by travelling to Syria, Ms Begumtold Sky News,external: ""In a way, yes, but I don't regret it because it's changed me as a person. ""It's made me stronger, tougher. I married my husband. I wouldn't have found someone like him back in the UK."" She continued: ""I had my kids, I did have a good time there. ""It's just that then things got harder and I couldn't take it any more."" IS teen's return to UK 'could be prevented' What can the UK do about the IS teenager? Trump tells allies to take back IS fighters Earlier, Mohammed Tasnime Akunjee, a lawyer for Ms Begum's family, told Radio 4's The World This Weekend: ""They are obviously very happy and joyous that Shamima has successfully given birth and that she's healthy."" But he added that following the reported death of Ms Begum's other two children in Syria, they were ""very concerned"" about the baby and wanted them to come back. Ms Begum and two other schoolgirls, Kadiza Sultana and Amira Abase, left Bethnal Green in east London in February 2015. Kadiza is thought to have died when a house was blown up, and the fate of Amira is unknown. Ms Begum was first tracked down by The Times. Inan interview,externalpublished on 13 February, she said she was heavily pregnant and had lost two children. Asked if she was aware of IS beheadings before going to Syria, she told Sky News: ""I knew about those things and I was OK with it. Because, you know, I started becoming religious just before I left. ""From what I heard, Islamically that is all allowed."" Kadiza Sultana, Amira Abase and Shamima Begum (l-r) in photos issued by police She continued: ""During the time I left I saw all the videos on the internet and that just kind of attracted me to them. Like it attracted a lot of people."" Ms Begum said she escaped from Baghuz, Islamic State's last stronghold in eastern Syria, two weeks ago.

"Just 91,000 families made use of the new Tax-Free Childcare system in December, according to new government data, That is far below the expected number. Official figures, analysed by the BBC, show the government had planned and budgeted for 415,000 families to be using the system by October 2017. By December 2018, just 22% of that number had signed up. The government urged families to see if they qualified. The shortfall is partly because the full rollout was pushed back following technical glitches with its website, but almost a year after the full rollout, take-up is still far lower than anticipated. And while the government had initially expected 324,000 more families to sign up, far more are potentially missing out. In total, an estimated 1.3 million could qualify for the help, meaning only about one in 14 eligible families has done so. That's costing people money - the Office for Budget Responsibility had forecast spending Â£800m on Tax-Free Childcare in 2017-18, but that was revised down to Â£37m specifically because of low take-up. In 2018, the Family and Childcare Trust's annual survey showed that the cost of a part-time nursery place for a child under two was Â£122 per week, a rise of 7% in a year. Families who use Tax-Free Childcare receive Â£2 from the state for every Â£8 they pay in, up to a value of Â£2,000 per child per year. The new scheme replaces Childcare Vouchers, which is now closed to new applicants. The government says Tax-Free Childcare is better than the old system as it is open to both employed and self-employed people, meaning about a million more families qualify for help. It is also paid per child rather than per parent, allowing lone-parent households to get the same amount of support. However, the scheme has suffered from technical glitches - including last year when 22,000 payments were not passed onto childcare providers - and the help available has been criticised for adding to parent confusion. Julia Waltham, head of policy at the campaign organisation Working Families, says more should be done to help parents identify the best way to get help with their childcare costs. ""The reason for the low take-up of Tax-Free Childcare could be because parents have chosen to stick with employer-supported childcare vouchers; and we know from our own research that working parents are increasingly reliant on informal childcare support from family, often grandparents,"" she said. ""But the fact remains that there are seven types of childcare support - each with different eligibility criteria and different ways of interacting with each other - available to parents and carers. ""This tangled web of support can be complicated, and difficult for parents and carers to navigate. Sarah Coles, personal finance analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says not enough is being done to inform parents of their options: ""When the market is getting behind something, they put money into communications and things happen. ""Tax-Free Childcare, however, is in the hands of the government, and so far there's every sign they're not throwing themselves behind efforts to let parents know about the free money on offer."" A government spokesperson said: ""Tax-Free Childcare is a great offer for working parents and more and more families are benefitting from it. We're urging all parents to check the Childcare Choices website to see how much they could save, and to apply."" They added that the number of parents benefitting from Tax-Free Childcare had almost doubled since March last year and they were running a national campaign to raise awareness.

"The FSB says 36% of small businesses in Scotland have suffered cashflow issues because of late payments Big companies who pay their suppliers ""unacceptably late"" should be banned from getting public contracts, small business leaders have claimed. The Federation of Small Businesses wants firms to prove in advance that they are ""responsible"" payers. It has called on the Scottish government to withhold devolved contracts in a bid to tackle the country's ""lamentable payment culture"". The Scottish government has said it ""strongly"" encourages prompt payment. The FSB claims late payments have led to cashflow issues at 36% of its firms. Andrew McRae, FSB's Scotland policy chairman, said: ""Our lamentable payment culture isn't a new phenomenon, but that doesn't make it any more acceptable. ""As we face the possibility of a sustained period of economic turbulence, we can't see bigger businesses use their smaller customers as a free source of credit."" He added: ""For far too long, government has tolerated big businesses treating their smaller suppliers with disrespect. ""At the FSB, our patience has grown thin and we want to see decision-makers pull every lever available to eradicate this corrosive practice."" The FSB says a survey which it carried out suggests that 36% of small businesses in Scotland have had financial difficulties as a result of late payments. The average value of each late payment owed to a Scottish firm is, according to the business organisation, Â£5,718. Mr McRae said: ""It is clear that late payment makes it more difficult to run a business in Scotland. ""In addition to seeing action from government, we need to see leaders of big businesses in Scotland take responsibility for how their companies treat their supply chains."" A Scottish government spokesperson said: ""We strongly encourage all businesses and organisations to ensure the prompt payment of suppliers, and expect those who deliver public contracts to adopt the highest standard of ethical business practices. ""Our work to foster and support fair business practices, such as prompt payment, includes the promotion of the Scottish Business Pledge. ""Over 590 businesses have already committed to the Pledge, and Ministers have written to all Scottish Government suppliers encouraging those who haven't already to sign up.""

"Porsche is warning UK customers they might have to pay 10% extra for cars delivered after Britain leaves the EU. The German firm wants buyers to sign a clause agreeing to a potential tariff, a move Porsche said is ""precautionary"". Porsche's owner Volkswagen declined to discuss if some of its other brands, including Audi, Lamborghini, Skoda, Bugatti, Seat, and Ducati might follow. A 10% surcharge would see the cost of an entry-level Porsche 911 rising from Â£93,110 to Â£102,421. The company's Macan sports utility and Boxster models start at about Â£46,000. Stuttgart-based Porsche said in an emailed statement to the BBC: ""As one potential outcome of the Brexit negotiations, there is a possibility that a duty of up to 10% may be applied to cars imported into the UK by us after March 29. ""In light of this, we have chosen to inform customers whose cars are likely to arrive after Brexit occurs to warn them that they may be affected by this tariff - allowing them to be fully informed at the point of sale and, if they wish, to adjust their order accordingly. ""This is a precautionary step in the interests of allowing our customers to plan ahead."" Bloomberg,externalquoted Porsche as saying that it needed ""comprehensive clarity"" on future UK relations with ""the EU very quickly"". Jaguar Land Rover confirms 4,500 job cuts Ford warns of 'catastrophic' no-deal Brexit Toyota urges support for PM's Brexit deal Customers who have placed deposits on or before 17 January will not be affected by the change, Porsche said. The company has no UK manufacturing, so all its cars are imported. Rebecca Chaplin, editor of Car Dealer magazine,which first reported Porsche's move,externalsaid it was bad news for industry because it would make buyers want to delay purchases until the picture was clearer after Brexit. ''Car dealers and manufacturers need to be able to communicate the prices of cars clearly to customers - it's a fundamental of this business and the government isn't helping them,"" she said. AA president Edmund King said: ""Import tariffs alone could push up the list price of cars imported to the UK from the continent by an average of Â£1,500 if brands and their retail networks were unable to absorb these additional costs."" Executives at several carmakers have expressed fears about the risk of tariffs, which they say could disrupt production and exports when the UK leaves the EU next month. Last week,Ford warned that a no-deal Brexit would be ""catastrophic"". On Sunday, a spokesman for Volkswagen declined to discuss a possible surcharge on its other car brands. But he told the BBC: ""We are keeping a very close eye on developments and reviewing the entire spectrum of possible effects. ""We are noting with regret that there is currently a stand-still regarding the decision on the negotiated deal. For us, this means a further period of insecurity and planning uncertainty. We continue to prepare for all eventualities. ""Irrespective of this, the United Kingdom will remain an important market for the Volkswagen Group, the second largest in Europe."" However, Leave supporters have dismissed fears over tariffs on imported cars, arguing that German manufacturers would oppose such an obstacle to one of their biggest markets. The UK is one of Porsche's biggest markets. The company sold 256,000 cars worldwide last year, with more than 12,500 in Britain.

"NatWest apologised and said it had started disciplinary proceedings against the employee A customer who called a bank to apply for a loan was told ""all vegans should be punched in the face"". The Bristol woman, who did not want to be named, went to NatWest for a loan to pay for a Â£400 nutrition diploma.

"This video can not be played Alison and Michael go on dates that their mothers help organise A couple who both have Down's syndrome have spoken about how their relationship has thrived thanks to the support of their families. Alison Williams, 35, and Michael Gallagher, 31, from Anglesey, have been together for 12 years after meeting at a sports club. Support group Mencap Cymru said people with learning disabilities have the right to meaningful relationships. It urged carers to help them and not to be ""frightened"". For Alison and Michael, being in a relationship has led to years of happiness. ""He's my prince,"" said Alison. Michael added: ""I think we'll be together forever."" Alison Williams and Michael Gallagher's friendship started when they met at a sports club The couple live with their families, but regularly stay at each other's homes and they enjoy holidays and hotel breaks together with the support of their mothers, who help to arrange their dates and stay nearby.

They say people sometimes ask intrusive questions about the nature of the couple's relationship but that it was ""none of their business"". While public attitudes to people with learning disabilities have changed in the past 30 years, Mencap Cymru said it wanted to change the way society thinks about their rights to friendships and relationships. It is using Valentine's Day to start a ""national conversation"" with people with learning disabilities, parents and support services about improving opportunities for people with a learning disability, starting with a launch at the Welsh Assembly. Director Wayne Crocker said: ""People who are supporting people with a learning disability might be frightened of the risks of an individual being involved in an intimate relationship.

"Derry's UEFA Cup run in 2006 saw them take on French giants PSG - after Brexit they will travel to Europe for every away In the world of sport, Brexit, backstops and borders may not be foremost in the thoughts of fans. That sport and politics should not mix is, after all, an oft repeated phrase. But for Derry City Football Club, this year celebrating 90 years since its first competitive match, Brexit puts the club in a unique position. When Brexit happens, the Candystripes become the only UK-based club competing in a domestic league within the European Union. The Irish border firms planning amid Brexit uncertainty Ulster star's concern on Brexit 'disrupting' Irish rugby Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Derry City's home ground lies four miles from the Irish border The city of Derry has a hinterland that straddles the Irish border. After Brexit, it will straddle the EU-UK frontier. The football club's Brandywell home ground lies less than four miles from County Donegal in the Republic of Ireland. And for more than 30 years they have played in the Republic of Ireland's league. How Brexit plays out may add to their cross-border dynamic. Derry has, over the past 30 years, gained a wealth of cross-border experience. And it has a history shaped previously by events off the pitch. Derry City returned from 13 years of footballing exile in 1985 and have played in the League of Ireland ever since In 1972 - a year regarded as one of the worst of the Troubles in Northern Ireland - a supporters' bus from visiting Ballymena United was burned on a visit to the Brandywell. The club was expelled from the Irish League in Northern Ireland and forced into the footballing wilderness. Its exile ended with acceptance into the Republic's League of Ireland in 1985. Derry City has declined to comment on how Brexit might impinge on the club. The Irish government, though, is planning for how cross-border sports could be affected by the UK's EU withdrawal. The Irish Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has said it acknowledges that the ""uncertainty of Brexit may pose challenges"" to sporting bodies and it is making itself ""available to assist such organisations should this be required"". After Brexit, the Derry-Donegal border will be part of the UK-EU land divide The government may be planning for all possibilities but fans are thinking only about football. Mickey Kerrigan, the chairman of the Pride of Northside supporters' club, has been travelling home and away to matches since 1985. Brexit is not a factor for fans eagerly anticipating a new season, he said. Politics, he added, ""should never interfere with football"". ""People can make all the predictions they want about Brexit but the truth is that no-one knows what will happen,"" he said. Fans are not factoring Brexit into their new season planning, says a supporters' club chairman ""Derry City fans have already been through the years of a hard border - we've had traffic tailbacks, delays and checks on the border and we shrugged our shoulders and got on with it. ""I can't see what change there will be for supporters - maybe some traffic issues if anything - but we have a new manager, new signings and are ready to get on the road for the new season. Derry City begin the 2019 League of Ireland campaign at home to UCDon 15 February. On 29 March - the date on which the UK is due to leave the EU - the Candystripes host Sligo Rovers at the Brandywell.

"Facebook needs far stricter regulation, with tough and urgent action necessary to end the spread of disinformation on its platform, MPs have said. A Commons committee has concluded,externalthat the firm's founder Mark Zuckerberg failed to show ""leadership or personal responsibility"" over fake news. Untrue stories from foreign powers were risking the UK's democracy, they said. Facebook welcomed the digital select committee's report and said it would be open to ""meaningful regulation"". MPs said that what was needed to deal with the proliferation of disinformation online and the misuse of personal data was a ""radical shift in the balance of power between social media platforms and the people"". The inquiry into fake news, which lasted more than a year, was conducted by the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, with much of the evidence focusing on the business practices of Facebook before and after the Cambridge Analytica scandal. What will the DCMS report achieve? What is fake news and can you identify it? Facebook employs UK fact-checkers to combat fake news Cambridge Analytica was a political advertising firm that had access to the data of millions of users, some of which was allegedly used to psychologically profile US voters. The data was acquired via a personality quiz. How such data, particularly in terms of political campaigning, was shared by Facebook was at the heart of the inquiry, alongside the effects of fake news. ""Democracy is at risk from the malicious and relentless targeting of citizens with disinformation and personalised 'dark adverts' from unidentifiable sources, delivered through the major social media platforms we use every day,"" concluded the report. ""The big tech companies are failing in the duty of care they owe to their users to act against harmful content, and to respect their data privacy rights."" The report called for: a compulsory code of ethics for tech companies, overseen by an independent regulator the regulator to be given powers to launch legal action if companies breach the code the government to reform current electoral laws and rules on overseas involvement in UK elections social media companies to be forced to take down known sources of harmful content, including proven sources of disinformation tech companies operating in the UK to be taxed to help fund the work for the Information Commissioner's Office and any new regulator set up to oversee them. In response, Facebook said: ""We share the committee's concerns about false news and election integrity and are pleased to have made a significant contribution to their investigation over the past 18 months, answering more than 700 questions and with four of our most senior executives giving evidence. ""We are open to meaningful regulation and support the committee's recommendation for electoral law reform. But we're not waiting. We have already made substantial changes so that every political ad on Facebook has to be authorised, state who is paying for it and then is stored in a searchable archive for seven years. No other channel for political advertising is as transparent and offers the tools that we do."" MPs made no secret of the fact that they found it difficult dealing with Facebook during the inquiry and chair Damian Collins had strong words for the firm and its leader, Mr Zuckerberg. ""We believe that in its evidence to the committee, Facebook has often deliberately sought to frustrate our work, by giving incomplete, disingenuous and at time misleading answers to our questions,"" he said. ""These are issues that the major tech companies are well aware of, yet continually fail to address. The guiding principle of the 'move fast and break things' culture seems to be that it is better to apologise than ask permission."" Mark Zuckerberg addressed the US Congress but refused to travel to the UK to speak to MPs MPs were particularly angry that Mr Zuckerberg did not come to the UK to answer questions in person. ""Even if Mark Zuckerberg doesn't believe he is accountable to the UK Parliament, he is to billions of Facebook users across the world,"" said Mr Collins. ""Evidence uncovered by my committee shows he still has questions to answer yet he's continued to duck them, refusing to respond to our invitations directly or sending representatives who don't have the right information."" He also accused Facebook of ""bullying"" smaller tech firms and developers who rely on their platform to reach users. The committee did not list specific examples of fake news. But it pointed to the government response to its interim report, which found at least 38 false narratives online after the nerve agent attack in Salisbury in March 2018. The report also noted that disinformation was not just spread on Facebook but also on platforms such as Twitter. And it found that, in the month following the publication of its interim report, 63% of the views to the online government response were from foreign internet protocol (IP) addresses, more than half of which were from Russia, highly unusual for a UK-based political inquiry. Source:  House of Commons The wide-ranging inquiry did not just look at fake news. It also examined how tech firms use data and data-targeting especially in political contexts, the use of political campaigning online and relationship between a complex network of firms including Canadian AIQ, Cambridge Analytica parent firm SCL and IT firm Six-Four-Three. MPs said current electoral regulations were ""hopelessly out of date for the internet age"" and needed urgent reform, so that the same principles of transparency of political communications that operate in the real world were applied online too. The committee called on the government to reveal how many investigations were currently being carried out into Russian interference in UK politics, particularly the EU referendum in 2016. They asked the government to launch an independent investigation into that. In order to better regulate social media firms, the MPs suggested creating a new category of tech firm - one that was neither a platform nor a publisher but something in-between, which would tighten the legal liability for content identified as harmful. Pressure is mounting on the tech giants to get to grips with the issue of fake news, and will add to calls from other ministers for regulation on the issue of harmful content, following the death of teenager Molly Russell. Her father accused Facebook-owned Instagram of facilitating her death, by failing to remove images of self-harm. And the Cairncross Review into the future of UK news recently recommendeda regulator should oversee Google and Facebookto ensure their news content is trustworthy. In her report, Dame Frances Cairncross said such sites should help users identify fake news and ""nudge people towards news of high quality"". Facebook has repeatedly said it is committed to fighting fake news and works with more than 30 fact-checking organisation around the world. Two of those agencies - Associated Press and Snopes - recently quit working with the social network. The ease with which fake news can be created was illustrated recently by a team of researchers at OpenAi which showed a machine learning system produce coherent, but untrue articles, just by trawling through news site Reddit.
