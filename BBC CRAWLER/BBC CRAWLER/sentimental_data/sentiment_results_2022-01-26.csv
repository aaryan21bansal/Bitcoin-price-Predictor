"Ofcom has launched an investigation after the BBC's complaints unit partially upheld complaints about its reporting of an alleged anti-Semitic incident in London in November. The media watchdog said the BBC's ruling, issued on Wednesday, ""raises issues under our due accuracy rules"". Complaints were made about the BBC's coverage of abuse directed towards a group of Jewish teenagers on a minibus. The Board of Deputies of British Jews welcomed Ofcom's investigation. In its ruling, the BBC's Executive Complaints Unit (ECU) - which is editorially independent of BBC News - said an article about the incident should have been updated. It said the broadcaster should have recognised there was ""genuine doubt"" about its report an anti-Muslim slur was heard from the bus. The BBC's complaints unit partially upheld complaints about accuracy and impartiality. However, it did not agree that the article amounted to victim-blaming. The use of ""alleged"" to describe the abuse was also described as necessary for legal reasons. The ECU investigation followed complaints made by individuals and groups including the Board of Deputies of British Jews and the chief rabbi. The BBC has acceptedthe findings of the ECUand apologised ""for not doing more to highlight that these details were contested"". ""We should have reflected this and acted sooner,"" a spokesperson addedin a statement. The Board of Deputies of British Jews president Marie van der Zyl said it was ""dismayed that the corporation continues to justify certain erroneous editorial decisions that continue to cloud the issue and will compound the distress faced by the victims. ""We welcome Ofcom's decision to investigate the incident. We trust that justice will prevail."" BBC seeks swift response to abuse story complaints The report related to an incident on Oxford Street on 29 November 2021, where Jewish passengers on a privately hired bus were subjected to abuse. Police said at the time they were treating the incident as a hate crime. No arrests have yet been made and inquiries are still ongoing. The BBC's original online article on 2 December claimed ""some racial slurs about Muslims"" could also be heard in footage of the incident. The following day, this line was amended to say ""a slur about Muslims"" could be heard from the bus. A BBC London TV report on the same story, also said ""you can hear some racial slurs about Muslim people"". However, groups including the Board of Deputies of British Jews disputed this and complained to the BBC about the coverage. After investigating the footage with the help of native Hebrew speakers, the Board of Deputies interpreted the words as a Hebrew phrase - ""Call someone, it's urgent"". The ECU's investigation looked at three questions: Did the BBC's coverage lack impartiality by victim-shaming the Jewish passengers on the bus, for example by suggesting they bore a share of responsibility for what happened? Was the BBC justified to say an insult had been heard coming from the bus? After new analysis suggested the words might not be an anti-Muslim slur, was the BBC right to continue defending the statements in its report as accurate? On these three questions, the ECU found: The BBC's coverage did not lack impartiality in the way it reported the alleged anti-Semitic incident compared with the report of the anti-Muslim slur. It said the word ""alleged"" is by no means unusual when reporting matters under police investigation, and the claim about the anti-Muslim slur was given context online with a quote from someone on the bus who denied hearing a slur. However, both the online and TV report were inaccurate as there was not enough evidence that the slurs had happened more than once. The amendment online (to ""a slur about Muslims"") resolved the issue online At least seven members of BBC News staff agreed that an anti-Muslim slur could be heard in the mobile phone recording. The BBC also put that claim to the group that provided the video, which the BBC took as confirmation the phrase had been spoken. The ECU said this editorial process was more than sufficient, did not breach standards and was made in good faith. However,the group disputes,externalbeing asked to provide any confirmation The ECU said it had listened to an enhanced audio of the recording - and noted other cases where the same audio can genuinely be construed differently by different listeners. The BBC commissioned a report from translators that found three out of four of them heard an anti-Muslim slur while one heard the Hebrew for ""Call someone, it's urgent"". The ECU said this shows there was doubt over the interpretation of the words, so the BBC should have recognised this earlier.

"Ashley John-Baptiste grew up in care believing he was an only child. Then, out of the blue, he received a message from a brother he never knew he had. He set out to explore what being split from siblings means to those who have been in the care system. As a toddler, I was placed in the care system. By 18, I had been moved between four foster families and a residential care home in south-east London. It's really hard to describe what it was like growing up in so many different homes. It felt like being under a cloud of rejection - no sense of family, no sense of belonging. I did meet my birth mum when I was 10, but never met my dad. I always wondered why I wasn't adopted - was it ever a possibility? Living in that residential home with other children gave me my first taste of brotherhood, but we had no control over our relationships in the long term. We would be moved, and disappear from each other's lives. Children who are placed in care are given ""life story"" sessions by their local authority - this is where a social worker tells a child what they know about their family background and history. I was around seven when I had mine, and I was told I was an only child. So it was a huge shock when, in my mid-20s, a man messaged me on Facebook to tell me he was my older brother. I can still remember the visceral sense of confusion I felt when I first saw his message. I had to re-read it several times. It took me a while to respond, but when we spoke we established that we had the same dad but different mothers, that there were more siblings out there and - most overwhelming for me - that we lived in the same area. All this time, my brother had been living close by. You can watch Ashley John-Baptiste's documentarySplit Up In Care: Life Without Siblings on BBC iPlayer Despite the intense curiosity of these initial conversations, we never made plans to meet in person. As much as I welcomed the messages from my new-found brother, I never felt ready to meet face-to-face. Eventually, four years ago, we stopped messaging each other. But then, in the spring of 2020, as I was taking my new-born baby for a hospital check-up, I bumped into him by chance. I was leaving the hospital, he was making his way in to visit a sick relative. I recognised him instantly. I called out to him sheepishly and to my relief, he recognised me. We spoke for what seemed like ages. Despite it being our first meeting, there was a natural ease to our conversation. It felt like we had known each other all along. I introduced him to my baby daughter. She met her uncle. We took a photo together in an unexpected ""family"" moment. Even though we haven't met since, that moment profoundly changed my life. Meeting my brother made me think how things could have been different if I had been given the chance to get to know my siblings when I was younger. I now know that I've got at least four, all older than me. Every time I moved home as a looked-after child, I was forced to assimilate into a new family, to integrate in a different community and make new friends. My sense of childhood identity was fragmented between the homes I lived in. No single person knew me across all of my moves. Meeting my brother made me imagine how things could have been if I'd had regular contact with my siblings during all the twists and turns of care. Imagine if I'd had someone like that to talk to, someone to see me grow up, it would have been a lifeline. Even a few meetings a year while I was in care could have been a foundation for a relationship in adulthood. I left care at 18 and lived alone in a council flat, before starting university. Living independently, where I was forced to make ends meet, brought a sense of abandonment and isolation that I wasn't prepared for. While I had incredible friends who eased the emotional intensity of leaving care, knowing my siblings at that stage of life might have given me a sense of family and belonging. Maybe there would have been a chance to spend Christmas with family, or have somewhere to go back to between terms at university. Leaving care: 'I made it to university, but then I fell through the cracks' During our meeting outside the hospital, my brother just seemed to understand everything I was saying. He had an implicit understanding of my journey and outlook. There was a connection. I am baffled that none of my social workers seemed to know about the existence of my siblings. When I spoke to my old social worker, Rosalyn Payne, who looked after me between the ages of 15-18, she was surprised to hear I had a brother. So why wasn't there any information about my family in my files? Files and information gathering have come a long way, Rosalyn told me. ""Back in the day we had paper files, now we have electronic files."" But that wasn't the only issue, she says. ""Families don't always tell us what we want to know at the time, and that happens quite a lot, where family members withhold information."" Then I asked her a question I had never dared ask before - was I ever considered for adoption? She told me that I was indeed put up for adoption when I was very young, but the couple who had been planning to adopt me got pregnant and withdrew from the process. It was shattering news - realising in that moment that my life could have been completely different. This video can not be played Watch the moment Rosalyn tells Ashley if he was ever considered for adoption However tough such questions are, I think they're important. Everybody wants to know who they are, and who they're connected to. For the documentary we wanted to get a national perspective on the state of sibling relationships in the care system, but there is a lack of data. The BBC sent more than 200 Freedom of Information requests to UK councils - out of all the authorities approached, nearly three-quarters responded. Based on these responses, nearly half of sibling groups in care are split up (45%) with more than 12,000 children separated from at least one of their siblings. And it can have a life-long impact. I met Saskia, 24, from Manchester who was taken into care with her two brothers after being rescued from their birth family. They were adopted, but their new home was no safe haven. Saskia and her brothers Saskia and her brothers suffered physical abuse and neglect for a decade in the adoptive home. When the adoption broke down, they went back into council care, where they were soon split up across different placements, in different areas. Saskia was 11 at the time and contact with her brothers broke down altogether a few years later. She told me that being away from them made her feel like she was ""not strong any more"". ""I lost such a key part of myself,"" she says. ""It was us three against the world, it always has been. Sometimes siblings are all you have left. If you take those away, you're taking away the last bit of someone's identity."" This video can not be played Saskia and her brothers have reconnected after being separated in care. Saskia has now trained as a social worker, which has given her a new perspective. In hindsight, she feels they should have been allowed to stay together. Her younger brother Toby really struggled and even spent time in prison. Although he has a job now, he told me his childhood experiences have made him into quite a resentful person. ""Even if life's going good, I'll still find some way to be negative in it."" Since they left care, they have been able to rebuild their relationships. ""My brothers are still in my life. I'm lucky. I see myself as very blessed,"" Saskia says. According to the law across all parts of the UK, siblings should be kept together when it is possible and safe to do so. But with a rise in the number of children in care there simply aren't enough foster carers - especially now children need a room of their own. All of this means councils are struggling. Children in care in England could hit almost 100,000 by 2025 I spoke to the director of children's social care at Derby City Council, Suanne Lim, who told me that she doesn't have enough resources to fully support the children in her authority's care - even though the government did provide extra funding for vulnerable families during the pandemic. Suanne Lim pioneered a rapid response team to keep families together ""We are very, very stretched. There have been year-on-year cuts to services that we are delivering and yet demand is rising,"" she said. ""Local authorities are close to the bone."" During the pandemic, Derby City council pioneered a rapid response team to support vulnerable families and prevent even more children from entering the system. Over the past 15 months the team say they have helped 60 families to stay together - and prevented 50 sibling groups from being split up. It's clear that social workers are under huge pressure. But at the same time, so many looked-after children are separated from their brothers and sisters and don't have the information about their families that they deserve. In Scotland,the law has recently been changed,externalto give siblings more control over their relationships. The Star Initiative in Fife hosts reunions for split-up sibling groups in care who get the chance to meet on the farm every few months, to hang out and rebuild their bonds. ""They've been through enough. Let's be a lifeline,"" says Karen Morrison, the foster carer who runs the charity. ""We're not only making a difference now, fast forward to when they leave the care system."" The Children's Commissioner for England, Dame Rachel de Souza, told the BBC that she would support a new law to keep siblings together. She has today publisheda new report,externalbased on the views of 6,000 children in care. An independent review of the England care system is currently underway, with findings and recommendations expected to be published later this year. For me, I have been able to answer more of the questions I had about who I am and where I come from. Even though I didn't grow up with my siblings, I now have the chance to get to know them. But perhaps most significantly, I can tell my daughter she has an uncle.

"This video can not be played 'This isn't a price blip - this is a resettling of the market' - Utility Regulator The Utility Regulator is warning that households and businesses will face gas price hikes of at least 30% in the coming weeks. Concerns over escalating tensions involving Russia mean further increases are also likely this year. Wholesale energy costs have risen significantly since last July and they account for about 50% of bills. As a result,SSE Airtricity put up prices twice last yearand Firmus alsoraised its prices three times in 2021. Both suppliers are expected to increase prices further in the coming weeks as higher wholesale prices will be passed on to customers. Prior to Covid, wholesale natural gas was about 50 pence per therm. Regulator warns NI energy prices will soar Why are gas prices so high? Northern Ireland customers warned of gas bill hike Surging prices due to supply issues mean wholesale prices peaked at Â£4.71 per therm in December in 2021. Reduced supply of gas from Russia (via Ukraine) is having a huge effect on prices. Forecasts expect these higher prices to continue throughout 2022 into 2023. Customers will again face higher bills in 2022 and 2023 John French, chief executive of the Utility Regulator, said: ""Today we're seeing gas prices at around Â£2.20 and on the futures market coming into the winter it's significantly more than that. ""So these prices are a concern - this isn't a price blip, this is a resettling of the market due to the Ukraine and Russian conflict. ""Historically, you might have seen gas prices rise a couple of pence in a year depending on if the weather was cold - we're seeing price movement of 50 pence within a day, which has never been experienced before. ""Unfortunately, we're expected to see at least a 30% increase, probably slightly higher, for consumers going forward on the gas price."" Peter McClenaghan, from the Consumer Council, said it was bad news across the board. ""It's bad for gas consumers, but there's bad news out there for all consumers,"" he said. Peter McClenaghan, from the Consumer Council, said it was bad news across the board for consumers ""If you're a driver and you drive a petrol or a diesel car, prices on the forecourts look like they're going to increase in the coming months. ""Similarly, if you use home heating oil to heat your home, prices are on the rise in relation to home heating oil as well. ""So across the board for consumers these are really worrying times."" Power NI, the only regulated supplier in Northern Ireland, put up prices 21% from January. No immediate price rise is expected there, it usually takes a bit longer to feed through. That will be one to watch in the weeks and months ahead. In Great Britain, an energy cap has shielded households from these price rises at about Â£1,200. However, Ofgem is expected to announce a significant hike on 7 February which will take effect from April, with some warning it could hit Â£2,000. That is why more suppliers in Great Britain have gone bust than in Northern Ireland. Regulator warns NI energy prices will soar How much are energy bills going up?

"Food poverty campaigner and chef Jack Monroe has welcomed changes in the pipeline to how the cost of living is measured. Ms Monroe had complained that everyday essentials were going up in price by more than the official inflation rate, hitting poorer people hardest. But she said the official way inflation is calculated failed to reflect this. On Wednesday, the official statistics body hit back, saying it was already changing how it measured prices. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) agreed that ""one inflation rate doesn't fit all"" but said it would soon be publishing a wider variety of cost-of-living metrics. ""We will continue to produce our headline inflation statistics, which are long running and follow international best practice,"" a spokesperson said. ""[But] we are committed to ensuring that our statistics are relevant and continue to meet user needs. As part of this we are restarting publication of inflation broken down according to how much income you earn."" They added that the agency also had longer-term plans to improve its inflation figures by including data from supermarket checkouts, ""which will help us understand people's experience of inflation in a much more detailed way"". Ms Monroe welcomed news of the ONS's plans. ""Delighted to be able to tell you that the ONS have just announced that they are going to be changing the way they collect and report on the cost of food prices and inflation to take into consideration a wider range of income levels and household circumstances,"" she said in a tweet.

Earlier, she told the BBC: ""People who are buying the 29p pasta, the 17p kidney beans, the 45p bags of rice - those statistics don't exist, so those people aren't represented."" That followed a series of tweets,externalin which she highlighted budget supermarket lines being discontinued. Why are prices rising so quickly? Seven reasons living costs are rising around the world Why are gas prices so high? The ONS told the BBC it had previously reflected how lower, mid and higher income groups were affected differently by rising prices in its statistics. But during the pandemic, supply chain problems and shortages meant there wasn't enough reliable data to publish those breakdowns, it said. The statistics body said it was also working on ""radical new plans"" to change the way price rises are monitored. ""[These will] increase the number of price points dramatically each month from 180,000 to hundreds of millions, using prices sent to us directly from supermarket checkouts,""  ONS head of inflation statistics Mike Hardie saidin a blog,external. Jack Monroe is right that a big increase in the price of the cheapest pasta or the cheapest rice in a store may not be being reflected in the official inflation figures. Here's why: the ONS sends shoppers to stores around the country to check prices. They go to the big supermarkets, as well as discount retailers such as Aldi and Lidl, and corner shops. The use of Aldi and Lidl are particularly important because some of the bigger chains price-check against them. If the item that the shopper bought the previous month has been discontinued, they will look for a replacement product of a similar quality. So, for example, if Morrisons stopped stocking a particular brand of spaghetti, which the shopper had bought last month, they would try to replace it with a similar product. ""However, if there were a change in quality, for example, from a value brand to premium brand, or from own brand to branded, then we would break the price chain,"" they told Reality Check, which means that they would buy a different product but not include the change in price in the inflation calculation. So a shopper looking for the cheapest spaghetti could face a big price increase that would not show up in the statistics. By using supermarket ""scanner"" data, that records every purchase, rather than the current method of monitoring the prices of representative products, the ONS hopes to reflect price rises more accurately. For example, if the current method monitors the price of one tin of branded baked beans, the new method would reflect every purchase of own brand, or budget beans, mid-range products, as well as premium range baked beans. The ONS said it could not provide more granular detail of how inflation affected specific income groups because information was not available on the precise contents of their shopping baskets at that level. It added that the process of incorporating the supermarket checkout data into the official statistics would take place over the next year or so.

"Lisa Rolland said she was pressured to give up her baby Women who were historically forced into giving up their children for adoption are being asked to share their experiences. An estimated 60,000 mothers in Scotland had babies adopted simply because they were unmarried. Lisa Rolland was living in Edinburgh in 1982 when she became pregnant at the age of 16. Still a schoolgirl, she remembers her GP's reaction to her pregnancy was to say: ""Who's been a silly girl then?"" ""I felt so shamed,"" she said. ""[I thought] I have obviously been bad, I have done something bad. I felt very isolated."" She was unmarried and says the pressure on her to give up her newborn son for adoption was so great, she could not stop it. ""I didn't choose adoption, it was presented to me as the only available option,"" she said. ""There was an implication that I wouldn't be able to have a career, it might ruin my life."" Lisa spent three days with her baby before he was taken away. ""I handed him over and then I went into the toilets and cried for about two hours. It was just dreadful,"" she said ""I just felt this massive pain and hole and grief, and just empty really."" Asked whether she gave up her baby or whether he was taken, she replied: ""My baby was taken."" Lisa was finally reunited with her son, Chris, about 10 years ago and they had a ""wonderful relationship"". ""It was really special, it was like a fairytale,"" Lisa said. Tragically, he died in a car accident two-and-half-years ago. ""At that time the grief was so hard,"" she said. ""It made me realise that I'd never grieved the baby, I'd kept all of that inside. ""I felt such shame and guilt that I hadn't fought for him. Would I have been such a bad mother?"" This video can not be played Julia Gillard said the ""shameful"" policy had created ""a legacy of pain"" In the 1950s, 60s and 70s up to 250,000 women across the UK coerced into handing over their babies. Many were denied access to housing and social benefits which may have allowed them to have kept them. Some of the women never had more children and said the loss caused them alifetime of grief. In 2013 Australia issued the world's first government formal apology for forced adoption, taking responsibility for the practice. Four years ago, the Canadian senate recommended the federal government issue an apology to 300,000 Canadian women. Forced adoption apology 'would heal' women's shame Mothers demand apology over forced adoptions 'They call us fallen women, bad women' And in January last year, the Irish Taoiseach, Micheal Martin, apologised to former residents of mother and baby homes in Ireland for the way they were treated over several decades. Months later Labour MSP Monica Lennon tabled a motion on historical forced adoption, calling the Scottish government to say sorry on behalf of the nation. She asked that ministers should speed up the work being done to reach the point of making the apology. The UK parliament at Westminster has launched its own separate inquiry into forced adoptions. The Joint Human Rights Committee began taking evidence before Christmas and is due to report later this year. The Scottish government is calling on families who experienced historic forced adoption to share their stories Scottish ministers have now launched an online questionnaire for those who wish to share their stories and views. A formal apology has not been issued by the Scottish government, but it said the survey would allow people to share their ""views and insight"" and inform the support process. A dedicated helpline has also been set up with the mental health charity Health in Mind, with staff who have understanding of trauma. Children's Minister Clare Haughey said she offered her sincere sympathies to families with experience of forced adoption and that the issue ""deserves to be looked at properly"". She said: ""Listening to these voices will help us to understand what support and action is needed. The last thing I want to do is to ask those affected to revisit the trauma it caused them, but, if they feel able, I would encourage them to give their views and share their experiences. ""I hope we can work together to explore next steps."" However, Ms Lennon said the survey would tell the government ""what women have been telling them for years"". She said: ""An apology to the women who were historically forced into giving up their babies for adoption is long overdue. Time is running out for many of these mothers and others have already gone to their graves after a lifetime of grief and guilt. ""Hearing 'we are sorry' from the first minister will help to end the stigma and begin to heal the burden of shame that the women have carried for decades. ""Nicola Sturgeon was not to blame for this historic injustice but the gift of an apology is in her hands and she should do the right thing.""

"Aberpergwm colliery provides coal to nearby Tata Steel in Port Talbot A Green Party MP has said it is ""shameful"" that a colliery in south Wales has been given permission to mine a further 40 million tonnes of coal. Caroline Lucas said fossil fuels must be left in the ground. The UK government, which oversees the Coal Authority which is responsible for licensing mines, said it had greatly reduced the country's reliance on coal. Energybuild said most of its coal was not burned for energy, but used in processes including water purification. Welsh ministers wanted the UK government to cancel the licence for Aberpergwm mine, near Glynneath in Neath Port Talbot. But it said on Wednesday evening it was committed to working with the company on business models that were sustainable. The colliery is the only producer ofhigh-grade anthracite,externalin Western Europe and supplies nearby Tata Steel plant in Port Talbot. The former coal villages turning green Welsh ministers demand scrapping of mining licence Phone alert system promised for coal tip residents Energybuild said it provided 160 well-paid jobs in the area, plus 16 apprenticeships. Managing director Rhidian Davies said last year that his products were ""in significant demand to support the transition to a sustainable green economy"". He added that Energybuild brought ""more than Â£100m of investment"" into the area. The firm was unable to comment on Wednesday until getting formal notification from the Coal Authority, whose website said an application for a full underground licence had been approved. MP Caroline Lucas called the awarding of the licence ""retrograde and damaging"" In November, Welsh Labour deputy climate change minister Lee Waters urged the UK government to stop ""40 million tonnes of coal"" being extracted over the next 18 years. His commentsprompted a row between Westminster and Cardiffover who was ultimately responsible. Ms Lucas, MP for Brighton Pavilion, said: ""It is unbelievable and utterly shameful, especially when the UK still retains the presidency of UN climate change body COP. ""It's made worse by the farcical dispute between the UK and Welsh governments over who has the power to cancel the licence."" She said ifthe aim to keep the rise in global temperatures to 1.5Cwas to be kept alive, ""fossil fuels must be left in the ground. Yet we're about to see more coal being dug up in our own backyard"". She added: ""It's hard to think of a more retrograde and damaging step, and one that completely undermines any climate diplomacy that Alok Sharma will be conducting in future months."" The UK government said it was the Coal Authority - not ministers - that was responsible for licensing coal mines. A spokesman added: ""We have taken massive steps to reduce our reliance on coal in recent years. ""Coal now accounts for less than 2% of our energy supply and will be phased out entirely by 2024."" Aberpergwm was originally granted a licence to mine coal before licensing powers were handed to the Welsh government. The mine operators had applied to the Coal Authority for formal recognition that the conditions attached to their original licence have been fulfilled. The Coal Authority website now says it has approved an application made in 2020 for a ""full underground licence"". The Welsh government said: ""We have been clear that we do not support the extraction of fossil fuels and are focused on the climate emergency. ""As the original licence was issued before powers in relation to coal licences were devolved, Welsh ministers are not able to intervene in the licensing process and appropriately apply Welsh policy.""

"Food poverty campaigner and chef Jack Monroe has welcomed changes in the pipeline to how the cost of living is measured. Ms Monroe had complained that everyday essentials were going up in price by more than the official inflation rate, hitting poorer people hardest. But she said the official way inflation is calculated failed to reflect this. On Wednesday, the official statistics body hit back, saying it was already changing how it measured prices. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) agreed that ""one inflation rate doesn't fit all"" but said it would soon be publishing a wider variety of cost-of-living metrics. ""We will continue to produce our headline inflation statistics, which are long running and follow international best practice,"" a spokesperson said. ""[But] we are committed to ensuring that our statistics are relevant and continue to meet user needs. As part of this we are restarting publication of inflation broken down according to how much income you earn."" They added that the agency also had longer-term plans to improve its inflation figures by including data from supermarket checkouts, ""which will help us understand people's experience of inflation in a much more detailed way"". Ms Monroe welcomed news of the ONS's plans. ""Delighted to be able to tell you that the ONS have just announced that they are going to be changing the way they collect and report on the cost of food prices and inflation to take into consideration a wider range of income levels and household circumstances,"" she said in a tweet.

Earlier, she told the BBC: ""People who are buying the 29p pasta, the 17p kidney beans, the 45p bags of rice - those statistics don't exist, so those people aren't represented."" That followed a series of tweets,externalin which she highlighted budget supermarket lines being discontinued. Why are prices rising so quickly? Seven reasons living costs are rising around the world Why are gas prices so high? The ONS told the BBC it had previously reflected how lower, mid and higher income groups were affected differently by rising prices in its statistics. But during the pandemic, supply chain problems and shortages meant there wasn't enough reliable data to publish those breakdowns, it said. The statistics body said it was also working on ""radical new plans"" to change the way price rises are monitored. ""[These will] increase the number of price points dramatically each month from 180,000 to hundreds of millions, using prices sent to us directly from supermarket checkouts,""  ONS head of inflation statistics Mike Hardie saidin a blog,external. Jack Monroe is right that a big increase in the price of the cheapest pasta or the cheapest rice in a store may not be being reflected in the official inflation figures. Here's why: the ONS sends shoppers to stores around the country to check prices. They go to the big supermarkets, as well as discount retailers such as Aldi and Lidl, and corner shops. The use of Aldi and Lidl are particularly important because some of the bigger chains price-check against them. If the item that the shopper bought the previous month has been discontinued, they will look for a replacement product of a similar quality. So, for example, if Morrisons stopped stocking a particular brand of spaghetti, which the shopper had bought last month, they would try to replace it with a similar product. ""However, if there were a change in quality, for example, from a value brand to premium brand, or from own brand to branded, then we would break the price chain,"" they told Reality Check, which means that they would buy a different product but not include the change in price in the inflation calculation. So a shopper looking for the cheapest spaghetti could face a big price increase that would not show up in the statistics. By using supermarket ""scanner"" data, that records every purchase, rather than the current method of monitoring the prices of representative products, the ONS hopes to reflect price rises more accurately. For example, if the current method monitors the price of one tin of branded baked beans, the new method would reflect every purchase of own brand, or budget beans, mid-range products, as well as premium range baked beans. The ONS said it could not provide more granular detail of how inflation affected specific income groups because information was not available on the precise contents of their shopping baskets at that level. It added that the process of incorporating the supermarket checkout data into the official statistics would take place over the next year or so.

"Ofcom has launched an investigation after the BBC's complaints unit partially upheld complaints about its reporting of an alleged anti-Semitic incident in London in November. The media watchdog said the BBC's ruling, issued on Wednesday, ""raises issues under our due accuracy rules"". Complaints were made about the BBC's coverage of abuse directed towards a group of Jewish teenagers on a minibus. The Board of Deputies of British Jews welcomed Ofcom's investigation. In its ruling, the BBC's Executive Complaints Unit (ECU) - which is editorially independent of BBC News - said an article about the incident should have been updated. It said the broadcaster should have recognised there was ""genuine doubt"" about its report an anti-Muslim slur was heard from the bus. The BBC's complaints unit partially upheld complaints about accuracy and impartiality. However, it did not agree that the article amounted to victim-blaming. The use of ""alleged"" to describe the abuse was also described as necessary for legal reasons. The ECU investigation followed complaints made by individuals and groups including the Board of Deputies of British Jews and the chief rabbi. The BBC has acceptedthe findings of the ECUand apologised ""for not doing more to highlight that these details were contested"". ""We should have reflected this and acted sooner,"" a spokesperson addedin a statement. The Board of Deputies of British Jews president Marie van der Zyl said it was ""dismayed that the corporation continues to justify certain erroneous editorial decisions that continue to cloud the issue and will compound the distress faced by the victims. ""We welcome Ofcom's decision to investigate the incident. We trust that justice will prevail."" BBC seeks swift response to abuse story complaints The report related to an incident on Oxford Street on 29 November 2021, where Jewish passengers on a privately hired bus were subjected to abuse. Police said at the time they were treating the incident as a hate crime. No arrests have yet been made and inquiries are still ongoing. The BBC's original online article on 2 December claimed ""some racial slurs about Muslims"" could also be heard in footage of the incident. The following day, this line was amended to say ""a slur about Muslims"" could be heard from the bus. A BBC London TV report on the same story, also said ""you can hear some racial slurs about Muslim people"". However, groups including the Board of Deputies of British Jews disputed this and complained to the BBC about the coverage. After investigating the footage with the help of native Hebrew speakers, the Board of Deputies interpreted the words as a Hebrew phrase - ""Call someone, it's urgent"". The ECU's investigation looked at three questions: Did the BBC's coverage lack impartiality by victim-shaming the Jewish passengers on the bus, for example by suggesting they bore a share of responsibility for what happened? Was the BBC justified to say an insult had been heard coming from the bus? After new analysis suggested the words might not be an anti-Muslim slur, was the BBC right to continue defending the statements in its report as accurate? On these three questions, the ECU found: The BBC's coverage did not lack impartiality in the way it reported the alleged anti-Semitic incident compared with the report of the anti-Muslim slur. It said the word ""alleged"" is by no means unusual when reporting matters under police investigation, and the claim about the anti-Muslim slur was given context online with a quote from someone on the bus who denied hearing a slur. However, both the online and TV report were inaccurate as there was not enough evidence that the slurs had happened more than once. The amendment online (to ""a slur about Muslims"") resolved the issue online At least seven members of BBC News staff agreed that an anti-Muslim slur could be heard in the mobile phone recording. The BBC also put that claim to the group that provided the video, which the BBC took as confirmation the phrase had been spoken. The ECU said this editorial process was more than sufficient, did not breach standards and was made in good faith. However,the group disputes,externalbeing asked to provide any confirmation The ECU said it had listened to an enhanced audio of the recording - and noted other cases where the same audio can genuinely be construed differently by different listeners. The BBC commissioned a report from translators that found three out of four of them heard an anti-Muslim slur while one heard the Hebrew for ""Call someone, it's urgent"". The ECU said this shows there was doubt over the interpretation of the words, so the BBC should have recognised this earlier.

"This video can not be played Watch: US President Joe Biden says a Russian invasion of Ukraine ""would change the world"" US President Joe Biden says he would consider personal sanctions on Vladimir Putin if Russia invades Ukraine. Mr Biden said there would be ""enormous consequences"" for the world if Russia made a move on the nation, which sits on its south-western border. His comments came as other Western leaders repeated warnings that Russia would pay a heavy price for invasion. Russia has accused the US and others of ""escalating tensions"" over the issue and denies planning to enter Ukraine. However, Moscow has deployed an estimated 100,000 soldiers near the border. The Kremlin has said it sees the Western military alliance Nato as a security threat, and is demanding legal guarantees that it will not add new members further east, including neighbouring Ukraine. But the US has said the issue at stake is Russian aggression, not Nato expansion. Fears of invasion have prompted Western embassies in Kyiv to withdraw some personnel. Ukraine's foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba however told reporters on Wednesday that while the troop build up ""poses a threat to Ukraine"", he believes it is ""insufficient for a full-scale offensive"". Diplomats from Russia, Ukraine, Germany and France gathered in Paris on Wednesday for talks about the ongoing tensions. Taking questions from reporters on Tuesday, Mr Biden replied ""yes"" when asked whether he could see himself imposing sanctions on the Russian president personally in the event of an invasion. Such a move across Ukraine's border would mean ""enormous consequences worldwide"" and could amount to ""the largest invasion since World War Two"", he said. On Wednesday UK Foreign Minister Liz Truss echoed Mr Biden's words, telling the BBC's Today programme that the government has ""ruled nothing out"" - including sanctions against the Russian leader - and said the UK is looking to ""toughen up"" its sanctions on people, banks and businesses. ""What is important is that all of our allies do the same. It is by collective action. By showing Putin we're united, we will help deter a Russian incursion,"" she said. Western powers agreed to ""unprecedented"" sanctions against Russia if it were to invade during crisis talks earlier this week. On Tuesday UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson raised the issue of banning Russia from the Swift international payments system, a move which senior Russian officials said meant Europe would not be able to pay for and receive Russian products. Stoicism and stockpiling on Ukraineâs uneasy borders Is Russia preparing to invade Ukraine? What is Nato and why doesn't Russia trust it? Russia responded angrily to Mr Biden's remarks. Dmitry Peskov, spokesman for Mr Putin, said such sanctions would not be ""painful"" for the president, but would be ""politically destructive"". He added that Russia's top government officials were banned from having any assets or accounts abroad, and that Mr Putin's salary went to the Rossiya bank. Separately, Mr Biden's administration said it wasworking with oil and gas suppliers around the world to boost shipments to Europe,externalin the event of Russia cutting off supplies, the New York Times reports. Russia currently provides about one-third of the crude oil and gas imported by the European Union. Speaking at a press conference on Wednesday, President of the European Council Charles Michel warned that aggression against Ukraine would result in serious consequences. ""A threat against Ukraine is a threat against Europe,"" he said. It is not unprecedented for Western powers to impose sanctions on heads of government or heads of state. Past recipients of international punitive action include the likes of Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, Bashar al-Assad of Syria and Muammar Gaddafi of Libya. But to sanction a despot is one thing, to sanction the leader of a major regional power is another. Targeting the head of a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council is rare, if not unprecedented, and to do so would plunge the UN into chaos. Sanctioning Putin would make co-operation harder on other issues. The West needs his help to revive the Iran nuclear deal. That support might disappear if Putin were sanctioned. It might also make it harder for Western leaders to meet Putin personally to discuss international crises. He might not be able to travel to Geneva or it might be illegal for the Western leader to meet him in Moscow. Sanctioning Putin might also make him more popular at home - Mugabe certainly used his sanctions as an electoral asset. They also might not work in a technical sense. Russia experts say that much of Putin's personal wealth is hidden away in the hands of third party proxies. And then there is politics. Sanctions are often done - and are best done - with allies. It might be hard to get unanimous support say, within the European Union, for personal sanctions against the Russian leader. Mr Biden also said on Tuesday that he would feel obliged to beef up Nato's presence in eastern Europe if Russia invaded, but he repeated that there were no plans to send US troops to Ukraine itself. The US has already put 8,500 combat-ready troops on alert to deploy at short notice. Russia has accused the US and NATO of ""flooding"" Ukraine with weapons and Western advisers. Washington has also warned Russian ally Belarus that it would ""face a swift and decisive response"" if it assisted in an invasion. Russia seized Ukrainian territory before, when it annexed Crimea in 2014. After Russian forces seized control, Crimea voted to join Russia in a referendum the West and Ukraine deemed illegal. Russian-backed rebels also control areas of eastern Ukraine near Russia's borders. That conflict has cost an estimated 14,000 lives, with a 2015 peace deal a long way from being fulfilled.

"Downing Street may have officially ""welcomed"" the police inquiry into the shenanigans behind closed doors in No 10 during lockdown. But what is likely to emerge in the next few days may be anything but welcome for Boris Johnson. It is only the second time in a century that a serving prime minister has been part of a police investigation. It is embarrassing, serious and could end up finding that some of the most powerful people in the country broke the law. For a Conservative leader of the party that prides itself on being the guarantor of law and order, that is deeply uncomfortable. Police to investigate No 10 lockdown parties What action could police take over No 10 parties? Birthday celebration for PM sparks new party row Before the police inquiry completes its work, Westminster and Whitehall is now braced for the results of the official inquiry into what went on, which could be published as early as Wednesday. I'm told the report prepared by senior official Sue Gray, who pulls no punches, is essentially complete. As I write late on Tuesday night, it is yet to be delivered officially to Downing Street, but Ms Gray is understood to be on the verge of submitting it. She is also keen, I'm told, that the inquiry is published in its entirety with no summary, or redactions which could blur or mask some of its more pointed information. The report is said to be full and frank, and is not expected to be easy reading either for the government, or the civil service itself. It's understood that there has been no shortage of evidence, with photographs and Whatsapp messages passed to her. Much of that evidence has over recent days been passed to the police, explaining why the Met concluded on Tuesday that it was important for them to publicly announce that they would also investigate. A dispute over whether the publication of the inquiry report would have to be delayed caused a frenzy in Westminster on Tuesday. But in the end, short of more twists in this bizarre and serious story, the report will be published very soon, quite separately and in advance of the police's conclusions. Publication could be crunch time politically, because remember, many Tory MPs have been so angered and embarrassed by weeks of allegations that they have been pondering seriously whether it's time to call a halt to Boris Johnson's time in office. For some of them, the report will give the cover they seek to make public their view that he ought to go. For many others, who might see themselves as the reasonable rump of the party, the findings of the report and how Boris Johnson explains himself immediately after will be the deciding factor into whether they will continue to back him or not. What they are acutely conscious of too is the reason why all the weeks of allegations have been so toxic. It's not that Boris Johnson and his staff had a slice of cake, or shared a hunk of Cheddar in the Downing Street back garden. It's because the impression has been created that while millions of members of the public were suffering because of the lockdown rules, those who had written and imposed them were not paying attention at all. There is a strand of opinion in the Tory party and among the public too, that, as we discussed yesterday, it's ridiculous to consider removing a prime minister over people having a sausage roll or a gin and tonic when they weren't meant to. Yet with the involvement of the police, a potentially bruising official inquiry and the broad public reaction reflected in the polls, there is no question that these are intensely difficult days for Downing Street, and a decisive 48 hours for Boris Johnson.

"Ofcom has launched an investigation after the BBC's complaints unit partially upheld complaints about its reporting of an alleged anti-Semitic incident in London in November. The media watchdog said the BBC's ruling, issued on Wednesday, ""raises issues under our due accuracy rules"". Complaints were made about the BBC's coverage of abuse directed towards a group of Jewish teenagers on a minibus. The Board of Deputies of British Jews welcomed Ofcom's investigation. In its ruling, the BBC's Executive Complaints Unit (ECU) - which is editorially independent of BBC News - said an article about the incident should have been updated. It said the broadcaster should have recognised there was ""genuine doubt"" about its report an anti-Muslim slur was heard from the bus. The BBC's complaints unit partially upheld complaints about accuracy and impartiality. However, it did not agree that the article amounted to victim-blaming. The use of ""alleged"" to describe the abuse was also described as necessary for legal reasons. The ECU investigation followed complaints made by individuals and groups including the Board of Deputies of British Jews and the chief rabbi. The BBC has acceptedthe findings of the ECUand apologised ""for not doing more to highlight that these details were contested"". ""We should have reflected this and acted sooner,"" a spokesperson addedin a statement. The Board of Deputies of British Jews president Marie van der Zyl said it was ""dismayed that the corporation continues to justify certain erroneous editorial decisions that continue to cloud the issue and will compound the distress faced by the victims. ""We welcome Ofcom's decision to investigate the incident. We trust that justice will prevail."" BBC seeks swift response to abuse story complaints The report related to an incident on Oxford Street on 29 November 2021, where Jewish passengers on a privately hired bus were subjected to abuse. Police said at the time they were treating the incident as a hate crime. No arrests have yet been made and inquiries are still ongoing. The BBC's original online article on 2 December claimed ""some racial slurs about Muslims"" could also be heard in footage of the incident. The following day, this line was amended to say ""a slur about Muslims"" could be heard from the bus. A BBC London TV report on the same story, also said ""you can hear some racial slurs about Muslim people"". However, groups including the Board of Deputies of British Jews disputed this and complained to the BBC about the coverage. After investigating the footage with the help of native Hebrew speakers, the Board of Deputies interpreted the words as a Hebrew phrase - ""Call someone, it's urgent"". The ECU's investigation looked at three questions: Did the BBC's coverage lack impartiality by victim-shaming the Jewish passengers on the bus, for example by suggesting they bore a share of responsibility for what happened? Was the BBC justified to say an insult had been heard coming from the bus? After new analysis suggested the words might not be an anti-Muslim slur, was the BBC right to continue defending the statements in its report as accurate? On these three questions, the ECU found: The BBC's coverage did not lack impartiality in the way it reported the alleged anti-Semitic incident compared with the report of the anti-Muslim slur. It said the word ""alleged"" is by no means unusual when reporting matters under police investigation, and the claim about the anti-Muslim slur was given context online with a quote from someone on the bus who denied hearing a slur. However, both the online and TV report were inaccurate as there was not enough evidence that the slurs had happened more than once. The amendment online (to ""a slur about Muslims"") resolved the issue online At least seven members of BBC News staff agreed that an anti-Muslim slur could be heard in the mobile phone recording. The BBC also put that claim to the group that provided the video, which the BBC took as confirmation the phrase had been spoken. The ECU said this editorial process was more than sufficient, did not breach standards and was made in good faith. However,the group disputes,externalbeing asked to provide any confirmation The ECU said it had listened to an enhanced audio of the recording - and noted other cases where the same audio can genuinely be construed differently by different listeners. The BBC commissioned a report from translators that found three out of four of them heard an anti-Muslim slur while one heard the Hebrew for ""Call someone, it's urgent"". The ECU said this shows there was doubt over the interpretation of the words, so the BBC should have recognised this earlier.

"Aberpergwm colliery provides coal to nearby Tata Steel in Port Talbot A Green Party MP has said it is ""shameful"" that a colliery in south Wales has been given permission to mine a further 40 million tonnes of coal. Caroline Lucas said fossil fuels must be left in the ground. The UK government, which oversees the Coal Authority which is responsible for licensing mines, said it had greatly reduced the country's reliance on coal. Energybuild said most of its coal was not burned for energy, but used in processes including water purification. Welsh ministers wanted the UK government to cancel the licence for Aberpergwm mine, near Glynneath in Neath Port Talbot. But it said on Wednesday evening it was committed to working with the company on business models that were sustainable. The colliery is the only producer ofhigh-grade anthracite,externalin Western Europe and supplies nearby Tata Steel plant in Port Talbot. The former coal villages turning green Welsh ministers demand scrapping of mining licence Phone alert system promised for coal tip residents Energybuild said it provided 160 well-paid jobs in the area, plus 16 apprenticeships. Managing director Rhidian Davies said last year that his products were ""in significant demand to support the transition to a sustainable green economy"". He added that Energybuild brought ""more than Â£100m of investment"" into the area. The firm was unable to comment on Wednesday until getting formal notification from the Coal Authority, whose website said an application for a full underground licence had been approved. MP Caroline Lucas called the awarding of the licence ""retrograde and damaging"" In November, Welsh Labour deputy climate change minister Lee Waters urged the UK government to stop ""40 million tonnes of coal"" being extracted over the next 18 years. His commentsprompted a row between Westminster and Cardiffover who was ultimately responsible. Ms Lucas, MP for Brighton Pavilion, said: ""It is unbelievable and utterly shameful, especially when the UK still retains the presidency of UN climate change body COP. ""It's made worse by the farcical dispute between the UK and Welsh governments over who has the power to cancel the licence."" She said ifthe aim to keep the rise in global temperatures to 1.5Cwas to be kept alive, ""fossil fuels must be left in the ground. Yet we're about to see more coal being dug up in our own backyard"". She added: ""It's hard to think of a more retrograde and damaging step, and one that completely undermines any climate diplomacy that Alok Sharma will be conducting in future months."" The UK government said it was the Coal Authority - not ministers - that was responsible for licensing coal mines. A spokesman added: ""We have taken massive steps to reduce our reliance on coal in recent years. ""Coal now accounts for less than 2% of our energy supply and will be phased out entirely by 2024."" Aberpergwm was originally granted a licence to mine coal before licensing powers were handed to the Welsh government. The mine operators had applied to the Coal Authority for formal recognition that the conditions attached to their original licence have been fulfilled. The Coal Authority website now says it has approved an application made in 2020 for a ""full underground licence"". The Welsh government said: ""We have been clear that we do not support the extraction of fossil fuels and are focused on the climate emergency. ""As the original licence was issued before powers in relation to coal licences were devolved, Welsh ministers are not able to intervene in the licensing process and appropriately apply Welsh policy.""

"People no longer need show proof of Covid status for bars, restaurants and cinemas Proof of Covid-19 status to enter bars, restaurants and cinemas has been scrapped in Northern Ireland. The change took effect at 12:00 GMT following a decision by Stormont ministers last week. Nightclubs - which were forced to close on 26 December - can now also reopen, along with the return of indoor standing events. Vaccine passports will still be required to access nightclubs and large events. The Stormont Executive said the use ofCovid certificationin hospitality would continue to be ""strongly encouraged"", but in guidance only. Thelatest relaxation of Covid ruleswas approved by the executive after health officials advised that Northern Ireland had passed the peak of community transmission with the Omicron variant. From Wednesday, the legal requirement for offices to take reasonable measures for 2m (6ft) social distancing is being removed, with guidance remaining in place that risk assessments should be carried out. However, further advice remains that people should work from home where they can and take lateral flow tests before meeting others. The executive will meet again on 10 February to review the remaining Covid restrictions in Northern Ireland. This will include the laws on mandatory use of face coverings, the legal requirement for track-and-trace in hospitality and the use of Covid certification in nightclubs and for large events. The removal of social distancing rules in work environments will allow more office workers to return from working at home. Social distancing requirements are being removed in work spaces Rachel McMillan runs an office in River House in Belfast and said they were removing blockages on seats in preparation. ""I do think it's important for our government to encourage office workers to come back and the economy really does rely on office workers being back in the city,"" she said. ""There are a lot of small businesses around the building and they really benefit from our members being back. She also said there were benefits for those workers who had not had a chance to meet in person with the rest of their colleagues. ""We have so many different businesses under the one roof,"" she added. ""We would put events on for members and it's a way for them to meet other people and collaborate with like-minded people and you're not going to get that at home."" Nightclubs have been preparing to reopen since hearing of the relaxation in regulations. Stephen Boyd runs a nightclub venue in Belfast and said they had had to be creative with their business model during periods of restriction, branching out into distributing bottled cocktails to off licenses. He said that staff would be coming in today to ""get rid of all the tables and get the dancefloor up and running"". ""I would like to think we could get back to normal and back to trading again, but again, who knows what's around the corner?"" he told Good Morning Ulster. Nightclubs will require proof of vaccination for entry He added that he hoped the rules for nightclubs on vaccine passports would be brought in line with other venues as soon as was safely possible. ""Hopefully within the next few weeks we can get a change,"" he said. ""I understand why these things have to be done, but if the risk isn't there, then surely it's time for them to go."" On Friday, First Minister Paul Givan said itwas his ""continued view"",externalthat vaccine passports should be scrapped in all settings. It came after the Irish government decided toend the use of Covid certification for all but international travelin the Republic of Ireland on Saturday.

"Food poverty campaigner and chef Jack Monroe has welcomed changes in the pipeline to how the cost of living is measured. Ms Monroe had complained that everyday essentials were going up in price by more than the official inflation rate, hitting poorer people hardest. But she said the official way inflation is calculated failed to reflect this. On Wednesday, the official statistics body hit back, saying it was already changing how it measured prices. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) agreed that ""one inflation rate doesn't fit all"" but said it would soon be publishing a wider variety of cost-of-living metrics. ""We will continue to produce our headline inflation statistics, which are long running and follow international best practice,"" a spokesperson said. ""[But] we are committed to ensuring that our statistics are relevant and continue to meet user needs. As part of this we are restarting publication of inflation broken down according to how much income you earn."" They added that the agency also had longer-term plans to improve its inflation figures by including data from supermarket checkouts, ""which will help us understand people's experience of inflation in a much more detailed way"". Ms Monroe welcomed news of the ONS's plans. ""Delighted to be able to tell you that the ONS have just announced that they are going to be changing the way they collect and report on the cost of food prices and inflation to take into consideration a wider range of income levels and household circumstances,"" she said in a tweet.

Earlier, she told the BBC: ""People who are buying the 29p pasta, the 17p kidney beans, the 45p bags of rice - those statistics don't exist, so those people aren't represented."" That followed a series of tweets,externalin which she highlighted budget supermarket lines being discontinued. Why are prices rising so quickly? Seven reasons living costs are rising around the world Why are gas prices so high? The ONS told the BBC it had previously reflected how lower, mid and higher income groups were affected differently by rising prices in its statistics. But during the pandemic, supply chain problems and shortages meant there wasn't enough reliable data to publish those breakdowns, it said. The statistics body said it was also working on ""radical new plans"" to change the way price rises are monitored. ""[These will] increase the number of price points dramatically each month from 180,000 to hundreds of millions, using prices sent to us directly from supermarket checkouts,""  ONS head of inflation statistics Mike Hardie saidin a blog,external. Jack Monroe is right that a big increase in the price of the cheapest pasta or the cheapest rice in a store may not be being reflected in the official inflation figures. Here's why: the ONS sends shoppers to stores around the country to check prices. They go to the big supermarkets, as well as discount retailers such as Aldi and Lidl, and corner shops. The use of Aldi and Lidl are particularly important because some of the bigger chains price-check against them. If the item that the shopper bought the previous month has been discontinued, they will look for a replacement product of a similar quality. So, for example, if Morrisons stopped stocking a particular brand of spaghetti, which the shopper had bought last month, they would try to replace it with a similar product. ""However, if there were a change in quality, for example, from a value brand to premium brand, or from own brand to branded, then we would break the price chain,"" they told Reality Check, which means that they would buy a different product but not include the change in price in the inflation calculation. So a shopper looking for the cheapest spaghetti could face a big price increase that would not show up in the statistics. By using supermarket ""scanner"" data, that records every purchase, rather than the current method of monitoring the prices of representative products, the ONS hopes to reflect price rises more accurately. For example, if the current method monitors the price of one tin of branded baked beans, the new method would reflect every purchase of own brand, or budget beans, mid-range products, as well as premium range baked beans. The ONS said it could not provide more granular detail of how inflation affected specific income groups because information was not available on the precise contents of their shopping baskets at that level. It added that the process of incorporating the supermarket checkout data into the official statistics would take place over the next year or so.

"This video can not be played Watch: US President Joe Biden says a Russian invasion of Ukraine ""would change the world"" US President Joe Biden says he would consider personal sanctions on Vladimir Putin if Russia invades Ukraine. Mr Biden said there would be ""enormous consequences"" for the world if Russia made a move on the nation, which sits on its south-western border. His comments came as other Western leaders repeated warnings that Russia would pay a heavy price for invasion. Russia has accused the US and others of ""escalating tensions"" over the issue and denies planning to enter Ukraine. However, Moscow has deployed an estimated 100,000 soldiers near the border. The Kremlin has said it sees the Western military alliance Nato as a security threat, and is demanding legal guarantees that it will not add new members further east, including neighbouring Ukraine. But the US has said the issue at stake is Russian aggression, not Nato expansion. Fears of invasion have prompted Western embassies in Kyiv to withdraw some personnel. Ukraine's foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba however told reporters on Wednesday that while the troop build up ""poses a threat to Ukraine"", he believes it is ""insufficient for a full-scale offensive"". Diplomats from Russia, Ukraine, Germany and France gathered in Paris on Wednesday for talks about the ongoing tensions. Taking questions from reporters on Tuesday, Mr Biden replied ""yes"" when asked whether he could see himself imposing sanctions on the Russian president personally in the event of an invasion. Such a move across Ukraine's border would mean ""enormous consequences worldwide"" and could amount to ""the largest invasion since World War Two"", he said. On Wednesday UK Foreign Minister Liz Truss echoed Mr Biden's words, telling the BBC's Today programme that the government has ""ruled nothing out"" - including sanctions against the Russian leader - and said the UK is looking to ""toughen up"" its sanctions on people, banks and businesses. ""What is important is that all of our allies do the same. It is by collective action. By showing Putin we're united, we will help deter a Russian incursion,"" she said. Western powers agreed to ""unprecedented"" sanctions against Russia if it were to invade during crisis talks earlier this week. On Tuesday UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson raised the issue of banning Russia from the Swift international payments system, a move which senior Russian officials said meant Europe would not be able to pay for and receive Russian products. Stoicism and stockpiling on Ukraineâs uneasy borders Is Russia preparing to invade Ukraine? What is Nato and why doesn't Russia trust it? Russia responded angrily to Mr Biden's remarks. Dmitry Peskov, spokesman for Mr Putin, said such sanctions would not be ""painful"" for the president, but would be ""politically destructive"". He added that Russia's top government officials were banned from having any assets or accounts abroad, and that Mr Putin's salary went to the Rossiya bank. Separately, Mr Biden's administration said it wasworking with oil and gas suppliers around the world to boost shipments to Europe,externalin the event of Russia cutting off supplies, the New York Times reports. Russia currently provides about one-third of the crude oil and gas imported by the European Union. Speaking at a press conference on Wednesday, President of the European Council Charles Michel warned that aggression against Ukraine would result in serious consequences. ""A threat against Ukraine is a threat against Europe,"" he said. It is not unprecedented for Western powers to impose sanctions on heads of government or heads of state. Past recipients of international punitive action include the likes of Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, Bashar al-Assad of Syria and Muammar Gaddafi of Libya. But to sanction a despot is one thing, to sanction the leader of a major regional power is another. Targeting the head of a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council is rare, if not unprecedented, and to do so would plunge the UN into chaos. Sanctioning Putin would make co-operation harder on other issues. The West needs his help to revive the Iran nuclear deal. That support might disappear if Putin were sanctioned. It might also make it harder for Western leaders to meet Putin personally to discuss international crises. He might not be able to travel to Geneva or it might be illegal for the Western leader to meet him in Moscow. Sanctioning Putin might also make him more popular at home - Mugabe certainly used his sanctions as an electoral asset. They also might not work in a technical sense. Russia experts say that much of Putin's personal wealth is hidden away in the hands of third party proxies. And then there is politics. Sanctions are often done - and are best done - with allies. It might be hard to get unanimous support say, within the European Union, for personal sanctions against the Russian leader. Mr Biden also said on Tuesday that he would feel obliged to beef up Nato's presence in eastern Europe if Russia invaded, but he repeated that there were no plans to send US troops to Ukraine itself. The US has already put 8,500 combat-ready troops on alert to deploy at short notice. Russia has accused the US and NATO of ""flooding"" Ukraine with weapons and Western advisers. Washington has also warned Russian ally Belarus that it would ""face a swift and decisive response"" if it assisted in an invasion. Russia seized Ukrainian territory before, when it annexed Crimea in 2014. After Russian forces seized control, Crimea voted to join Russia in a referendum the West and Ukraine deemed illegal. Russian-backed rebels also control areas of eastern Ukraine near Russia's borders. That conflict has cost an estimated 14,000 lives, with a 2015 peace deal a long way from being fulfilled.

"The growth in pet ownership during the Covid pandemic has continued with retailer Pets at Home forecasting record sales and profits. The company said it had a ""record Christmas"" with strong growth in sales across its 445 UK stores and its 300 vet and grooming outlets. It said sales in the third quarter were up 8.7% on 2020 and 28.1% on 2019. Boss Peter Pritchard said despite the rise in the cost of living, people were unlikely to cut back on pet spending. ""I think history actually tells us one of the very last things customers do is cut back on their pets, they are much more likely to cut back on a holiday or a big discretionary purchase,"" he told the BBC's Today Programme. ""Pets are very much part of the family. We expect given the fact there are more pets in the country than ever before we expect revenue to be and continue to be very strong this year."" In its trading statement, Pets at Home said it was experiencing ""a number of inflationary pressures"" across its supply chain, and planned to mitigate them by seeking rent reductions at its shops and ""operational efficiencies"" across its business. Mr Pritchard said he recognised customers were ""under pressure"". ""We want to keep pet ownership really affordable for our customers,"" he added. He said the firm was on track to report ""a record year of sales and profit growth"", adding the company had served more pet owners than ""ever before"" in the 12-week period from 8 October to 30 December 2021. ""In the month of December alone we actually also groomed 90,000 dogs, 5,500 dogs on Christmas Eve alone, so it was a very busy Christmas for us,"" said Mr Pritchard. Pets at Home sells pet products and some small animals and fish. Pets prove 'a lifesaver' for lockdown loneliness It also provides grooming and veterinary services for cats and dogs, and people can subscribe to its Puppy & Kitten Club which offers discounts. Mr Pritchard confirmed the lockdown-induced craze for buying pets showed no signs of abating, with the company's retail arm welcoming 25,000 new customers a week and more than 9,000 new client registrations for its vet business. ""There a more pet owners than ever before,"" he said. In March 2021, the Pet Food Manufactures' Association said a total of 3.2 million households in the UK had bought a new pet since the start of the pandemic. Matt Britzman, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said there was a continuing trend of ""pet humanisation"", with owners ""passing their own health and food principles on to their pets - even going as far as having their own social media following"". ""That's more opportunity for those in the business of servicing - it's often the more premium brands that cater for these specific needs, giving a welcomed leg up to sales and margins,"" he said. ""UK pet ownership shows little signs of slowing down as working from home becomes ever more popular and households favour locations that offer more space,"" he added.

"The law commissions' report focuses on how to define self-driving Human drivers should not be legally accountable for road safety in the era of autonomous cars, a report says. In these cars, the driver should be redefined as a ""user-in-charge"", with very different legal responsibilities, according to the law commissions for England and Wales, and Scotland. If anything goes wrong, the company behind the driving system would be responsible, rather than the driver. And a new regime should define whether a vehicle qualifies as self-driving. In the interim, carmakers must be extremely clear about the difference between self-drive and driver-assist features. There should be no sliding scale of driverless capabilities - a car is either autonomous or not. And if any sort of monitoring is required - in extreme weather conditions, for example - it should not be considered autonomous and current driving rules should apply. The law commissions were asked in 2018 to come up with a series of reports on the regulatory framework for automated vehicles and their use on public roads. In this final report, their recommendations include: a user-in-charge cannot be prosecuted for offences arising directly from the driving task, such as dangerous driving, speeding or running a red light, but remains responsible for other tasks, including insurance and checking people are wearing seatbelts some vehicles may be allowed to drive themselves with no-one in the driving seat and a licensed operator responsible for overseeing the journey data to understand fault and liability following a collision must be accessible sanctions for carmakers who fail to reveal how their systems work Transport Minister Trudy Harrison said the government would ""fully consider"" the recommendations. The Scottish and Welsh governments will also decide whether to introduce legislation. Drivers using ALKS will not need to monitor the road or keep their hands on the wheel Matthew Avery, chief research strategy officer at Thatcham Research, which was involved in the consultation, said: ""We applaud the recommendations that compel carmakers to use appropriate terminology when marketing these systems, to prevent motorists from becoming convinced that their car is fully self-driving when it is not. ""In the next 12 months, we're likely to see the first iterations of self-driving features on cars in the UK. ""It's significant that the Law Commission report highlights the driver's legal obligations and how they must understand that their vehicle is not yet fully self-driving"" Last year, the Department for Transport gave the green light to automated lane-keeping systems (ALKS), the first type of hands-free driving to be legalised in the UK. Drivers using ALKS will not need to monitor the road or keep their hands on the wheel but must stay alert and be able to take over within 10 seconds when requested by the system. Tesla, one of the leading companies developing driverless cars, has faced a barrage of questions over its marketing of Autopilot, which is similar to ALKS and considered level two on the five defined levels of self-driving cars. Last week, Californian prosecutors filed two counts of vehicular manslaughter against the driver of a Tesla who went through a red light, while using Autopilot, hitting another car and killing two people - the first time someone has been charged with manslaughter when using a partially automated driving system. Previously in the US, a driver was killed when playing a video game while using Autopilot.

"This video can not be played Watch: US President Joe Biden says a Russian invasion of Ukraine ""would change the world"" US President Joe Biden says he would consider personal sanctions on Vladimir Putin if Russia invades Ukraine. Mr Biden said there would be ""enormous consequences"" for the world if Russia made a move on the nation, which sits on its south-western border. His comments came as other Western leaders repeated warnings that Russia would pay a heavy price for invasion. Russia has accused the US and others of ""escalating tensions"" over the issue and denies planning to enter Ukraine. However, Moscow has deployed an estimated 100,000 soldiers near the border. The Kremlin has said it sees the Western military alliance Nato as a security threat, and is demanding legal guarantees that it will not add new members further east, including neighbouring Ukraine. But the US has said the issue at stake is Russian aggression, not Nato expansion. Fears of invasion have prompted Western embassies in Kyiv to withdraw some personnel. Ukraine's foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba however told reporters on Wednesday that while the troop build up ""poses a threat to Ukraine"", he believes it is ""insufficient for a full-scale offensive"". Diplomats from Russia, Ukraine, Germany and France gathered in Paris on Wednesday for talks about the ongoing tensions. Taking questions from reporters on Tuesday, Mr Biden replied ""yes"" when asked whether he could see himself imposing sanctions on the Russian president personally in the event of an invasion. Such a move across Ukraine's border would mean ""enormous consequences worldwide"" and could amount to ""the largest invasion since World War Two"", he said.

"Thai police display some of the jewels they recovered, with Kriangkrai in handcuffs on the right Saudi Arabia and Thailand have ended a 30-year row over a scandal involving stolen jewels and a string of murders. The resumption of full diplomatic ties came during a visit to Riyadh by Thai Prime Minister Prayut Chan-ocha. A Thai cleaner working for a Saudi prince took the gems in 1989. A rare 50 carat blue diamond was never recovered. Three Saudi diplomats were shot dead in Bangkok following the theft. Several top Thai policemen were implicated in the affair but never convicted. The deal opens the way for Thais once again to find employment in Saudi Arabia, which says it needs millions of overseas workers. It will also allow renewed co-operation in areas such as tourism and petrochemicals. Saudi Arabian Airlines has announced it will restart direct flights to Thailand in May. The mystery of the stolen blue diamond Relations between the two countries were downgraded after Thai cleaner Kriangkrai Techamong stole the jewels from his employer Prince Faisal, the eldest son of King Fahd of Saudi Arabia. Kriangkrai Techamong ended up being jailed for less than three years Kriangkrai sold them back in Thailand without realising their real value. But when the Thai police returned some of the jewels - said to be worth $20m (Â£14.8m) - the Saudis said most were fake. Then, a year after the theft, three Saudi diplomats in Thailand were shot dead, and an investigator sent there to track the missing jewels disappeared. Two Thais linked to the crime also died in suspicious circumstances. Kriangkrai the cleaner and one police officer were the only two individuals jailed over the affair. Saudi Arabia accused the Thai police of a bungled investigation, amid allegations the stolen jewels were acquired by senior officers. In 1994, the then Saudi charge d'affaires said the murdered diplomats had been ""silenced"". Thai Prime Minister Prayut Chan-ocha's landmark visit to Saudi Arabia is the highest-level contact between the countries since the bizarre and embarrassing scandal, the BBC's Jonathan Head reports from Bangkok. In a joint statement, the prime minister expressed ""sincere regret over the tragic events in Thailand between 1989 and 1990"". The Thai and Saudi leaders hope they have drawn a line under the affair Analysts say the dispute has cost billions of dollars in trade, and led to job losses for tens of thousands of Thai migrant workers. Before the scandal, as many as 300,000 Thais were employed  in Saudi Arabia. Most of the jewels were never found. The scarcity and value of blue diamonds is in part down to the fact so few places in the world mine for them. The stones get their colour when the chemical boron is present during formation. The origin of the Saudi blue diamond is unclear and no known photographs of it exist.

"Sainsbury's, John Lewis, Waitrose and Morrisons will continue to ask people in England to wear masks in their shops when Plan B rules end on Thursday. Rail operators also said passengers would be expected to wear masks after the legal requirement for face coverings in public places is dropped. All said they would encourage, not force, customers to comply. Plan B rules, imposed in early December to battle Omicron, are being lifted  as infections have peaked nationally. But the government is still advising people to wear masks in enclosed or crowded spaces and when meeting strangers. Trade union Usdaw, which represents 360,000 retail workers, has urged customers to continue to ""observe Covid safety measures"", despite the mandatory requirement for masks ending. Where do I still need to wear a mask? Face mask rules and Covid passes to end in England Sainsbury's said safety was its ""highest priority"" and that it would ask customers and staff in England to ""continue to wear a face covering in our stores if they are able to"". It will use poster campaigns and Tannoy announcements to get the message across. ""In Scotland and Wales face coverings remain mandatory for those who can wear them in our stores, in line with the latest government restrictions,"" the supermarket added. ""We continue to have a range of safety measures in all of our stores, including screens and sanitising stations."" Meanwhile, John Lewis said it would be ""suggesting people wear masks"" in its department stores and Waitrose shops from Thursday, but added: ""It will be down to individuals to make a personal choice."" Electronics retailer Currys said it would urge its staff to continue to wear masks in-store and while delivering products to homes, but wouldn't ask customers. ""We will continue to assess our approach based on infection rates and colleague feedback,"" the company said. Sanitising stations will stay at Sainsbury's supermarkets Mandatory mask-wearing has been a contentious issue during the pandemic, with industry bodiescalling for customers to ""respect"" the rules. There have also been questions about who is responsible for enforcing the measures, after violence against retail staffincreased during the crisis. Despite this, retailers such as Sainsbury's and Tesco asked shoppers to continue wearing face coverings when the previous mask-wearing mandate ended in July 2021. At the time, Sainsbury's said it followed supportive feedback from customers and colleagues. Paddy Lillis, Usdaw general secretary, said it was ""deeply disappointing"" the government had ended mandatory face coverings in shops when ""case numbers remain high"". ""We hope all retailers will continue to put staff and customer safety first,"" he added. ""Wearing a face covering is an important measure to help protect workers who have no option but to interact with the public."" The government says it is easing Plan B rules because of how well the public has followed the measures and because of the success of the vaccine booster rollout. Prime Minister Boris Johnson told MPs last week scientists believed the Omicron wave has peaked. Elsewhere, the Rail Delivery Group, which represents train companies, said operators will still ask passengers to wear masks after Thursday and said it expected most would comply. It comes after TfL said its passengers would be expected to keep wearing face coverings as government rules are relaxed. ""Travelling by train is as safe, if not safer, than other indoor activities, with ventilation that refreshes the air in carriages every six to nine minutes,"" the Rail Delivery Group said. ""In line with government guidance, train companies will be asking passengers to wear face coverings out of courtesy to others, unless they're exempt."" Helen Dickinson, boss of industry body British Retail Consortium (BRC), said the removal of Plan B measure would ""enable shopping to return to more normal experience for customers, employees and businesses"". ""Retailers ask customers to be considerate to those around them when choosing whether to wear a face covering and to respect the decision of other customers,"" she added. ""Retailers continue to implement many other existing safety measures such as hand sanitiser and perspex screens."" Scientific evidence has suggested coronavirus transmission mainly happens indoors where people are closer together.

"The law commissions' report focuses on how to define self-driving Human drivers should not be legally accountable for road safety in the era of autonomous cars, a report says. In these cars, the driver should be redefined as a ""user-in-charge"", with very different legal responsibilities, according to the law commissions for England and Wales, and Scotland. If anything goes wrong, the company behind the driving system would be responsible, rather than the driver. And a new regime should define whether a vehicle qualifies as self-driving. In the interim, carmakers must be extremely clear about the difference between self-drive and driver-assist features. There should be no sliding scale of driverless capabilities - a car is either autonomous or not. And if any sort of monitoring is required - in extreme weather conditions, for example - it should not be considered autonomous and current driving rules should apply. The law commissions were asked in 2018 to come up with a series of reports on the regulatory framework for automated vehicles and their use on public roads. In this final report, their recommendations include: a user-in-charge cannot be prosecuted for offences arising directly from the driving task, such as dangerous driving, speeding or running a red light, but remains responsible for other tasks, including insurance and checking people are wearing seatbelts some vehicles may be allowed to drive themselves with no-one in the driving seat and a licensed operator responsible for overseeing the journey data to understand fault and liability following a collision must be accessible sanctions for carmakers who fail to reveal how their systems work Transport Minister Trudy Harrison said the government would ""fully consider"" the recommendations. The Scottish and Welsh governments will also decide whether to introduce legislation. Drivers using ALKS will not need to monitor the road or keep their hands on the wheel Matthew Avery, chief research strategy officer at Thatcham Research, which was involved in the consultation, said: ""We applaud the recommendations that compel carmakers to use appropriate terminology when marketing these systems, to prevent motorists from becoming convinced that their car is fully self-driving when it is not. ""In the next 12 months, we're likely to see the first iterations of self-driving features on cars in the UK. ""It's significant that the Law Commission report highlights the driver's legal obligations and how they must understand that their vehicle is not yet fully self-driving"" Last year, the Department for Transport gave the green light to automated lane-keeping systems (ALKS), the first type of hands-free driving to be legalised in the UK. Drivers using ALKS will not need to monitor the road or keep their hands on the wheel but must stay alert and be able to take over within 10 seconds when requested by the system. Tesla, one of the leading companies developing driverless cars, has faced a barrage of questions over its marketing of Autopilot, which is similar to ALKS and considered level two on the five defined levels of self-driving cars. Last week, Californian prosecutors filed two counts of vehicular manslaughter against the driver of a Tesla who went through a red light, while using Autopilot, hitting another car and killing two people - the first time someone has been charged with manslaughter when using a partially automated driving system. Previously in the US, a driver was killed when playing a video game while using Autopilot. And in 2018, a UK resident was banned from driving after climbing into the passenger seat of his Tesla on the motorway.

"The growth in pet ownership during the Covid pandemic has continued with retailer Pets at Home forecasting record sales and profits. The company said it had a ""record Christmas"" with strong growth in sales across its 445 UK stores and its 300 vet and grooming outlets. It said sales in the third quarter were up 8.7% on 2020 and 28.1% on 2019. Boss Peter Pritchard said despite the rise in the cost of living, people were unlikely to cut back on pet spending. ""I think history actually tells us one of the very last things customers do is cut back on their pets, they are much more likely to cut back on a holiday or a big discretionary purchase,"" he told the BBC's Today Programme. ""Pets are very much part of the family. We expect given the fact there are more pets in the country than ever before we expect revenue to be and continue to be very strong this year."" In its trading statement, Pets at Home said it was experiencing ""a number of inflationary pressures"" across its supply chain, and planned to mitigate them by seeking rent reductions at its shops and ""operational efficiencies"" across its business. Mr Pritchard said he recognised customers were ""under pressure"". ""We want to keep pet ownership really affordable for our customers,"" he added. He said the firm was on track to report ""a record year of sales and profit growth"", adding the company had served more pet owners than ""ever before"" in the 12-week period from 8 October to 30 December 2021. ""In the month of December alone we actually also groomed 90,000 dogs, 5,500 dogs on Christmas Eve alone, so it was a very busy Christmas for us,"" said Mr Pritchard. Pets at Home sells pet products and some small animals and fish. Pets prove 'a lifesaver' for lockdown loneliness It also provides grooming and veterinary services for cats and dogs, and people can subscribe to its Puppy & Kitten Club which offers discounts. Mr Pritchard confirmed the lockdown-induced craze for buying pets showed no signs of abating, with the company's retail arm welcoming 25,000 new customers a week and more than 9,000 new client registrations for its vet business. ""There a more pet owners than ever before,"" he said. In March 2021, the Pet Food Manufactures' Association said a total of 3.2 million households in the UK had bought a new pet since the start of the pandemic. Matt Britzman, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said there was a continuing trend of ""pet humanisation"", with owners ""passing their own health and food principles on to their pets - even going as far as having their own social media following"". ""That's more opportunity for those in the business of servicing - it's often the more premium brands that cater for these specific needs, giving a welcomed leg up to sales and margins,"" he said. ""UK pet ownership shows little signs of slowing down as working from home becomes ever more popular and households favour locations that offer more space,"" he added.

"Care home staff and nurses are among key workers facing the prospect of being paid less this year than last, according to the Trades Union Congress. Pay increases are failing to keep up with rising inflation, leading to another year of ""wages gloom"" for public sector workers, the TUC said. That could be a ""hammer blow to morale"" prompting staff to quit, it said. The Treasury said that public sector wages would be going up for the next three years. The TUC is calling on the government to ensure public sector workers receive a ""decent"" pay rise. The union umbrella body said public sector workers were already thousands of pounds worse off after suffering a ""lost decade"", during which their pay failed to keep up with price rises. With inflation now forecast to reach 6% or higher in 2022, the situation was set to get worse, it said. Surging food prices push inflation to 30-year high Inflation surge sends UK interest payments higher Frances O'Grady, the TUC general secretary, said: ""Hard work should pay for everyone. ""But millions of key workers - on the frontline of the pandemic - face another year of wages gloom. That is not right. ""The government must stop burying its head and get pay rising across the economy. Ministers cannot abandon families during this cost-of-living crisis."" In real terms - that is, after inflation is taken into account - nurses are Â£2,700 worse off than in 2010, the TUC has calculated. Care workers employed by local authorities are more than Â£1,600 a year worse off, it added. The TUC said excessive workloads and a lack of recognition, as well as stagnating wages, was causing a staffing crisis in the NHS and other public services, prompting staff to quit. The body called on the government to prioritise key worker pay in 2022 by easing restrictions on pay policy and providing more funding to government departments. A Treasury spokesperson said: ""We recognise the incredible work that public sector workers have continued to do throughout the pandemic, and the challenges many of them have faced as key workers, and it's right that wages across the public sector will increase for each of the next three years. ""We have also backed public services with the largest real-terms increase in overall departmental spending for any Parliament this century."" The government is also raising the National Living Wage to Â£9.50 an hour from April and is providing Â£12bn this financial year and next to help families with the cost of living, including helping households with their energy bills. Prices went up at their fastest rate in 30 years in the year to December, with inflation hitting 5.4%. Soaring food costs and the energy bill crisis were the main factors driving price rises. In December, the Bank of England predicted that inflation could hit 6% this year, butsome economists expect a 7% rate by April. Inflation surge sends UK interest payments higher Surging food prices push inflation to 30-year high Why are prices rising in the UK?

"Care home staff and nurses are among key workers facing the prospect of being paid less this year than last, according to the Trades Union Congress. Pay increases are failing to keep up with rising inflation, leading to another year of ""wages gloom"" for public sector workers, the TUC said. That could be a ""hammer blow to morale"" prompting staff to quit, it said. The Treasury said that public sector wages would be going up for the next three years. The TUC is calling on the government to ensure public sector workers receive a ""decent"" pay rise. The union umbrella body said public sector workers were already thousands of pounds worse off after suffering a ""lost decade"", during which their pay failed to keep up with price rises. With inflation now forecast to reach 6% or higher in 2022, the situation was set to get worse, it said. Surging food prices push inflation to 30-year high Inflation surge sends UK interest payments higher Frances O'Grady, the TUC general secretary, said: ""Hard work should pay for everyone. ""But millions of key workers - on the frontline of the pandemic - face another year of wages gloom. That is not right. ""The government must stop burying its head and get pay rising across the economy. Ministers cannot abandon families during this cost-of-living crisis."" In real terms - that is, after inflation is taken into account - nurses are Â£2,700 worse off than in 2010, the TUC has calculated. Care workers employed by local authorities are more than Â£1,600 a year worse off, it added. The TUC said excessive workloads and a lack of recognition, as well as stagnating wages, was causing a staffing crisis in the NHS and other public services, prompting staff to quit. The body called on the government to prioritise key worker pay in 2022 by easing restrictions on pay policy and providing more funding to government departments. A Treasury spokesperson said: ""We recognise the incredible work that public sector workers have continued to do throughout the pandemic, and the challenges many of them have faced as key workers, and it's right that wages across the public sector will increase for each of the next three years. ""We have also backed public services with the largest real-terms increase in overall departmental spending for any Parliament this century."" The government is also raising the National Living Wage to Â£9.50 an hour from April and is providing Â£12bn this financial year and next to help families with the cost of living, including helping households with their energy bills. Prices went up at their fastest rate in 30 years in the year to December, with inflation hitting 5.4%. Soaring food costs and the energy bill crisis were the main factors driving price rises. In December, the Bank of England predicted that inflation could hit 6% this year, butsome economists expect a 7% rate by April.

"Manufacturers have seen their stocks of semiconductors plunge amid the global chip shortage, the US Department of Commerce has warned. A survey of more than 150 firms found supplies had fallen from an average of 40 days' worth in 2019 to just five days in late 2021. Sales of devices soared during the pandemic, leaving semiconductor makers struggling to keep up with demand. The shortage has resulted in huge disruptions for major industries. Millions of products - cars, washing machines, smartphones and more - rely on these chips, also known as semiconductors. ""With sky-rocketing demand and full utilisation of existing manufacturing facilities, it's clear the only solution to solve this crisis in the long-term is to rebuild our domestic manufacturing capabilities."" theUS secretary of commerce Gina Raimondo said in a statement,external. The research also found that demand for semiconductors was as much as 17% higher last year than it was in 2019. Meanwhile,US House Democrats on Tuesday unveiled legislation,externalaimed at increasing US competitiveness with China and spending $52bn (Â£38.5bn) on semiconductor production and research, after the Senate approved funding in June. President Joe Biden's administration is pushing to persuade Congress to approve funding to help boost chip production in the US, as shortages of the key components have exacerbated supply chain bottlenecks. Why is there a chip shortage for computers and cars? Last week, Intel said it would invest $20bn to build what could be the world's biggest chip-making complex in Ohio. In November, Samsung announced that it had chosen a site close to the US city of Taylor in Texas for its new $17bn computer chip plant. The plant is expected to be operational by the second half of 2024. It is the South Korean electronics giant's biggest-ever US investment.

"People no longer need show proof of Covid status for bars, restaurants and cinemas Proof of Covid-19 status to enter bars, restaurants and cinemas has been scrapped in Northern Ireland. The change took effect at 12:00 GMT following a decision by Stormont ministers last week. Nightclubs - which were forced to close on 26 December - can now also reopen, along with the return of indoor standing events. Vaccine passports will still be required to access nightclubs and large events. The Stormont Executive said the use ofCovid certificationin hospitality would continue to be ""strongly encouraged"", but in guidance only. Thelatest relaxation of Covid ruleswas approved by the executive after health officials advised that Northern Ireland had passed the peak of community transmission with the Omicron variant. From Wednesday, the legal requirement for offices to take reasonable measures for 2m (6ft) social distancing is being removed, with guidance remaining in place that risk assessments should be carried out. However, further advice remains that people should work from home where they can and take lateral flow tests before meeting others. The executive will meet again on 10 February to review the remaining Covid restrictions in Northern Ireland. This will include the laws on mandatory use of face coverings, the legal requirement for track-and-trace in hospitality and the use of Covid certification in nightclubs and for large events. The removal of social distancing rules in work environments will allow more office workers to return from working at home. Social distancing requirements are being removed in work spaces Rachel McMillan runs an office in River House in Belfast and said they were removing blockages on seats in preparation. ""I do think it's important for our government to encourage office workers to come back and the economy really does rely on office workers being back in the city,"" she said. ""There are a lot of small businesses around the building and they really benefit from our members being back. She also said there were benefits for those workers who had not had a chance to meet in person with the rest of their colleagues. ""We have so many different businesses under the one roof,"" she added. ""We would put events on for members and it's a way for them to meet other people and collaborate with like-minded people and you're not going to get that at home."" Nightclubs have been preparing to reopen since hearing of the relaxation in regulations. Stephen Boyd runs a nightclub venue in Belfast and said they had had to be creative with their business model during periods of restriction, branching out into distributing bottled cocktails to off licenses. He said that staff would be coming in today to ""get rid of all the tables and get the dancefloor up and running"". ""I would like to think we could get back to normal and back to trading again, but again, who knows what's around the corner?"" he told Good Morning Ulster. Nightclubs will require proof of vaccination for entry He added that he hoped the rules for nightclubs on vaccine passports would be brought in line with other venues as soon as was safely possible. ""Hopefully within the next few weeks we can get a change,"" he said. ""I understand why these things have to be done, but if the risk isn't there, then surely it's time for them to go."" On Friday, First Minister Paul Givan said itwas his ""continued view"",externalthat vaccine passports should be scrapped in all settings. It came after the Irish government decided toend the use of Covid certification for all but international travelin the Republic of Ireland on Saturday.

"Downing Street may have officially ""welcomed"" the police inquiry into the shenanigans behind closed doors in No 10 during lockdown. But what is likely to emerge in the next few days may be anything but welcome for Boris Johnson. It is only the second time in a century that a serving prime minister has been part of a police investigation. It is embarrassing, serious and could end up finding that some of the most powerful people in the country broke the law. For a Conservative leader of the party that prides itself on being the guarantor of law and order, that is deeply uncomfortable. Police to investigate No 10 lockdown parties What action could police take over No 10 parties? Birthday celebration for PM sparks new party row Before the police inquiry completes its work, Westminster and Whitehall is now braced for the results of the official inquiry into what went on, which could be published as early as Wednesday. I'm told the report prepared by senior official Sue Gray, who pulls no punches, is essentially complete. As I write late on Tuesday night, it is yet to be delivered officially to Downing Street, but Ms Gray is understood to be on the verge of submitting it. She is also keen, I'm told, that the inquiry is published in its entirety with no summary, or redactions which could blur or mask some of its more pointed information. The report is said to be full and frank, and is not expected to be easy reading either for the government, or the civil service itself. It's understood that there has been no shortage of evidence, with photographs and Whatsapp messages passed to her. Much of that evidence has over recent days been passed to the police, explaining why the Met concluded on Tuesday that it was important for them to publicly announce that they would also investigate. A dispute over whether the publication of the inquiry report would have to be delayed caused a frenzy in Westminster on Tuesday. But in the end, short of more twists in this bizarre and serious story, the report will be published very soon, quite separately and in advance of the police's conclusions. Publication could be crunch time politically, because remember, many Tory MPs have been so angered and embarrassed by weeks of allegations that they have been pondering seriously whether it's time to call a halt to Boris Johnson's time in office. For some of them, the report will give the cover they seek to make public their view that he ought to go. For many others, who might see themselves as the reasonable rump of the party, the findings of the report and how Boris Johnson explains himself immediately after will be the deciding factor into whether they will continue to back him or not. What they are acutely conscious of too is the reason why all the weeks of allegations have been so toxic. It's not that Boris Johnson and his staff had a slice of cake, or shared a hunk of Cheddar in the Downing Street back garden. It's because the impression has been created that while millions of members of the public were suffering because of the lockdown rules, those who had written and imposed them were not paying attention at all. There is a strand of opinion in the Tory party and among the public too, that, as we discussed yesterday, it's ridiculous to consider removing a prime minister over people having a sausage roll or a gin and tonic when they weren't meant to. Yet with the involvement of the police, a potentially bruising official inquiry and the broad public reaction reflected in the polls, there is no question that these are intensely difficult days for Downing Street, and a decisive 48 hours for Boris Johnson.

"Star Hobson suffered a cardiac arrest as a result of catastrophic injuries and died in September 2020 Bradford Council is to be stripped of control of its children's services in the wake of Star Hobson's murder. The authority's department will instead be operated by a council-owned trust led by an independent board. Ofsted rated children's services as ""inadequate"" in 2018 and a commissioner was appointed a year after 16-month-old Star was killed in September 2020. The trust's creation follows recommendations by the commissioner to Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi. Mr Zahawi said: ""Keeping vulnerable children safe from harm is non-negotiable. ""Where a council is not meeting its duty to do this, we will take action to protect children and put their needs first."" He said that it was clear from commissioner Steve Walker's recommendations the council needed support to improve. Mr Zahawi added:  ""I'm pleased that Bradford council have agreed to establish a new trust that will bring positive change for the council and independent oversight that drives improvements."" Commissioner Mr Walkerwas appointed by the governmentin September 2021 over the ""slow pace of change"" after Ofsted inspectors had said some children remained ""at risk of serious harm"". He began his review a year after Star died following months of ""neglect, cruelty and injury"". Bradford Council was contacted on a number of occasions about the treatment of Star Hobson by Savannah Brockhill (left) and Frankie Smith in the run up to her death Savannah Brockhill, 28, wasjailed for a minimum of 25 years for her murder. Star's mother, Frankie Smith, 20, was sentenced to eight years for causing or allowing her death. Their trial heard of at least five occasions when concerned family members and friends made referrals about Star's treatment to the council's social services department. Star bled to death after suffering ""catastrophic"" injuries at the hands of Brockhill, her mother's ""violent-tempered"" girlfriend, at the couple's home in Keighley. Bradford Council leader Susan Hinchcliffe acknowledged the ""pace of improvement needs to quicken"" but said the trust would enable the authority to focus on ""delivering consistently high-quality care"". ""Inevitably this will take time and we're acutely conscious that there can be no pause in our improvement journey,"" she said. Ms Hinchcliffe said the Labour-controlled authority was committed to supporting ""front-line staff"". She said the new arrangement would give members of the children's services department ""certainty over the future direction"" and an opportunity to draw on resources and expertise nationally. A whistleblower who works for Bradford Council's children's services department has told BBC Look North about the difficulties faced by people employed by the authority. They said staff had raised issues with managers in the department about working conditions due to their high case loads, exacerbated by the number of people leaving. ""It's unmanageable workloads. Individual social workers are being set up to fail,"" the anonymous employee told the BBC. They added that senior colleagues were ""constantly afraid"" of hearing things not being done correctly and ""just wanted to cover it up"". The whistleblower said staff in the department were ""overworked, under-trained, unsupported and voiceless because any grievance you raise, it will be shut down and you will be made an example of"". An independent review examining how the authorities responded to social services referrals in the months leading to Star's death will be rolled into the national review launched in the wake of the murder of Arthur Labinjo-Hughes, the government also said. Bradford West MP Naz Shah said there had been ""opportunities to get this right"" Robbie Moore, Conservative MP for Keighley and Ilkley, said children across Bradford had been ""repeatedly"" failed by the council. ""Vulnerable and looked-after children deserve much better. ""Our area has been haunted by such failings for far too long which has led to so many tragedies in our area, including cases of neglect, continuous child sexual exploitation and the recent tragic murder of Star Hobson which could have been prevented had Children's Services acted upon repeated warnings,"" said Mr Moore. He echoed previous calls for Ms Hinchliffe and authority chief executive Kersten England to resign and said he had ""no confidence"" in their leadership. Star Hobson suffered a cardiac arrest as a result of catastrophic injuries and died on 22 September 2020 High caseloads, high staff turnover and the use of lots of agency staff are among the problems Bradford's children's services has struggled with over past years. We don't yet know whether or not those pressures were a factor in the way child protection services responded to the concerns raised by family and friends about Star Hobson. That will be for the official review to decide. However, the government-appointed commissioner is clear in his conclusion that ""the council doesn't have the capacity and capability to improve services at pace on its own"". The new arm's-length organisation will be one of about a dozen independent trusts in England set up after local authority children's services have failed to improve quickly enough. In some cases, that has led to significant improvement. In others, progress has been much slower. Not least because changing the structure of services does not in itself deal with underlying problems, such as the difficulty of recruiting and keeping experienced staff. Naz Shah, Labour MP for Bradford West said there was a ""dysfunction across many areas"" of the council related to leadership, organisational culture, and a lack of resources, with the latter causing ""stresses and strains"". ""But you can only use the issue of resources for so long as a mitigating factor. ""The truth is it requires leadership, it takes bold and brave leadership especially given that concerns have been raised, I raised them in 2016 and I've been raising them since. ""This hasn't been happening overnight."" Anne Longfield, the former Children's Commissioner for England,external, welcomed the government announcement and said she hoped it ""marks the beginning of a period of major reform"" and investment in children's social care, adding: ""We cannot hope to protect vulnerable children on the cheap"".
