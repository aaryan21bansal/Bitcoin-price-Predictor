"Tony May was only a few weeks old when he was abandoned by the River Thames in London, in the middle of World War Two. He had no idea who his parents were for more than 70 years. Then a DNA detective dug up the truth about his past. A few days before Christmas, in 1942, a baby boy was brought in to a police station near the Houses of Parliament in London. He had been found wrapped in a bright blue woman's coat on Victoria Embankment, a road lined with trees and occasional benches that runs along the north bank of the Thames. The boy was judged to be one month old and, after no-one came forward to claim him, he was allotted a birthday. He also needed a name. It was common at the time to refer to the place a child was found - and so he became Victor Banks. ""I always wondered who they were, you know? And why I would have been abandoned, I think that's the main thing."" Tony May is sitting in an old easy chair in his flat in St Albans, just to the north of London. There are jazz CDs piled on a side table, and photos of trumpet players on the wall. ""I used to run a club on the jazz circuit,"" he tells me. ""We'd get musicians who had played at Ronnie Scott's."" Tony is in his 70s. Though he moves carefully around his flat his voice is full of energy. He gestures now to one of the pictures crammed on to his mantelpiece. ""My mum and dad, Arthur and Ivy, didn't have any brothers or sisters so they had friends who we called aunt and uncle. They were lovely to me."" The couple adopted Victor Banks when he was a toddler in 1944, changing his name to Tony May. They went on to adopt a little girl called Eleanor who became Tony's sister. Tony remembers being told he was adopted when he was about seven. ""It was no big deal really. But I remember my sister went around telling everyone we were adopted and I was so embarrassed."" Tony and his sister, Eleanor When he was growing up, Tony was particularly close to his father. ""My dad was very bright but although he was very interested in sport he was no good at it at all. When he realised I was good at it, he used to give me and my friend Mick cricket catching practice every night. He'd come home from the bank - I can see him now with his hat and umbrella - and he'd come down the garden to help us. And he'd take me to see major sporting events at White City stadium in London. ""I became a very good cricketer and schoolboy athlete because he believed in me. And when you're adopted you need people to believe in you."" Tony's adoption was rarely mentioned by his parents. ""I remember once my dad knocked on my bedroom door when I was a teenager and asked what music I was listening to,"" Tony says. ""It was John Coltrane on tenor sax playing ballads. He said: 'Do you think you play such mournful music, because you're adopted?' I said: 'No Dad, this is world-class music played all over the world.' He said: 'Oh, OK then.' That was that, there was no dialogue about it."" Tony only discovered he had been found as a baby on his wedding day, at the age of 23. ""My dad sidled over to me after the service,"" he says. ""He told me that when I got back from my honeymoon he'd have an envelope for me with my exam passes and adoption order. He said: 'There's a word on it that you might not know, the wordfoundling. Just letting you know.' I didn't twig for ages what it meant. It was much later that I realised I'd been abandoned."" Tony went into banking, like his father, and then into recruitment. He also had two children. Looking back, he wonders whether not knowing where he came from did affect him, despite what he told his father about the music he'd been listening to that day. ""I worried a lot about things going wrong, which meant I worked extra hard at getting things right. It did mean when the auditors came around at work I knew I'd get a clean sheet. ""Though I laugh and joke and muck about, I'm not tactile. I'm fairly reserved, I would say, about showing emotion. But I can cry my eyes out watching a rugby match."" It wasn't until his adoptive parents had died that Tony felt ready to investigate where he came from. His first port of call was the London Record Office, where he was amazed to find out he wasn't allowed to look at his own adoption file. The rules at that time stipulated that a social worker had to go in and make notes in pencil on his behalf. The file revealed that after being found on Victoria Embankment on 19 December 1942 he was taken to the old Canon Row police station near Westminster Bridge - but there was no mention of who had found him or at what time of day. After being examined at a hospital in Chelsea, he was evacuated to Easneye Nursery in Ware, Hertfordshire, away from the risk of bombing. Ivy May Little Victor first met Arthur and Ivy May at Easneye. Before they were allowed to adopt him they  fostered him for a year and Tony is visibly moved as he reads out a welfare report from that time. ""Date on which visit made: 5 November 1943. Is the child well cared for? The answer is: 'She devotes her whole time and attention to the baby and he is responding well to individual care and is becoming interested in people and things.' Are the applicants satisfied with the child? 'They are very pleased with him and delighted to have a baby of their own.'"" ""That's lovely, that,"" Tony says, tapping the table for emphasis. Letters in Tony's file reveal the Mays wrote to the authorities to see if they could find out any more about his history. The reply was definitive - exhaustive inquiries had been carried out to trace the parents, but all efforts had been unsuccessful. Having reached this dead end, Tony then took his story to the media in the hope it might jog someone's memory. He appeared on radio, TV and in newspapers in the mid-1990s. Some nurses who had worked at the Easneye nursery during the war came forward, but Tony was no closer to finding out about the circumstances of his birth. ""I had given up. I thought, 'No man can do more than I have done, so that's it,'"" he says. Then, four years ago, Tony joined a Facebook group for foundlings. They swapped stories about their lives and their theories about why they might have been left. Tony thought he could be the result of a liaison between a British woman and an American GI. It's estimated that about 22,000 children were born in this way between 1942 and 1945. ""I was found in London and I know this is an area where it was happening,"" he says. He mentioned his theory in the Facebook group, and it was a move that would change his life. The post was spotted by Julia Bell, a genetic genealogist who has used DNA to track down American servicemen who fathered children during World War Two. Julia's first successful case was working out who her own GI grandfather was. DNA detective Julia Bell was looking for a new challenge ""My mother was over the moon to find out. Her father had died in 2009 but she had five brothers and sisters living all over the US. They send her presents for her birthday."" Julia was inspired by her experience to work on other GI cases, but she was now looking for a new challenge. ""I was finding the American servicemen cases very easy. They all knew who their mothers were, but not their fathers. I thought, 'How about giving that gift of knowing where you come from to people who don't know who either side was?'"" She had started looking at foundling cases when she came across Tony's Facebook post, so she introduced herself and offered to help free of charge. ""I thought, why not?"" Tony says. ""I've tried everything you know, if you like you might as well go for it. I didn't think she'd be successful. How can you possibly be from so little information?"" And he was right that the case was a tough one, in fact it was the hardest that Julia had ever attempted to crack. The first thing Julia did was search newspaper archives, where she found a small article from 20 December 1942 reporting Tony's discovery. It read: ""A blue-eyed boy four weeks old, wrapped in a bright blue jacket, part of a woman's costume, has been found abandoned on the Embankment."" Julia wondered whether this could be a sign that Tony was left in a hurry, and that perhaps it hadn't been planned. She then turned to DNA, which she was convinced could help unravel Tony's case. It was 2016, and there had been a massive increase in the number of people in the US and the UK using DNA testing kits to research their family history. Her first step was to send off a saliva sample from Tony to one of several privately owned companies that offer DNA matching with other clients on their database. The amount of DNA we share with other people is measured in centimorgans. The number ranges from single digits for distant cousins to 3,400 centimorgans for a parent and child. The test revealed a woman called Deborah in Toronto, who appeared to be about a third cousin of Tony's, judging from the amount of DNA they shared. But this promising link proved a dead end. Julia realised Deborah was most likely related to Tony on her father's side, and Deborah said she didn't know who her father was. Listen to Embankment Baby, a BBC World Service documentary on BBC Sounds Explore podcasts from The Documentary After Deborah, Tony's closest relation was a fourth cousin called June, in Scotland. That meant she probably shared with Tony a pair of great-great-great-grandparents, who lived sometime in the 1800s. ""Now June had more of a complete tree, which she was willing to share with me,"" Julia says. To find out which ancestor pair Tony and June shared, Julia searched the databases of the DNA-matching companies and found someone who was a cousin of both Tony and June at a similar distance. ""It's called triangulating,"" Julia explains. ""I found an ancestor pair living in the 1860s that all three people shared. Then I created a chart with all the different possible lines of descent, with every marriage and every birth. ""I looked for people further down the lines who were living descendants and asked them to do a DNA test. Each time I found a closer match that would help me refocus and refocus, getting closer to my goal."" By a closer match, Julia means a cousin closer to Tony in his family tree, sharing a larger amount of DNA. The most common DNA test examines the pairs of chromosomes inherited from each parent (except the pair of sex chromosomes), but Julia also got Tony to do another test that looked at mitochondrial DNA, which is passed from mother to child via the egg cell. It suggested a strong maternal link to Lanarkshire, in the central lowlands of Scotland. Every cell in your body contains DNA molecules, packaged in structures called chromosomes, which hold the instructions the body needs to develop, survive and reproduce. The most common DNA test focuses on chromosomes from the cell nucleus, and particularly those inherited from both parents (22 ""autosomal"" chromosome pairs). The test matches you with anyone else on the database who shares a direct ancestor, reaching back about seven generations. In men it is also possible to test the Y chromosome, which is passed from father to son and helps identify the paternal line. The maternal line can be investigated by testing the DNA in mitochondria - subunits of a cell responsible for generating the cell's energy. This DNA is passed from mother to child in the egg cell. It was slow and painstaking work but towards the end of 2018 Julia identified a couple she thought could be Tony's maternal grandparents, who had lived in Kirkcaldy, north of Edinburgh. They had a son still living in Scotland called Bill who was in his 90s and was reluctant to do a test. However Bill's daughter, Kathleen, agreed to help once she heard Tony's story. The results showed Kathleen was almost certainly his first cousin. ""So I'm thinking it's most likely that Tony's mother was Bill's sister,"" Julia says. ""Bill had a sister called Mary who died in 1988. Mary had had two children - a son, Peter, who had died in 2006, but also a daughter called Sheena, who was still living."" After thinking about it long and hard, Sheena agreed to meet Julia. ""Well this was back in January 2019,"" Sheena says, sitting across from me in her conservatory in Kettering, Northamptonshire. ""My cousin Kathleen had explained to me about Julia and this person who was looking for his parents. I thought whoever this Tony is deserves to know who his family is, but I didn't click at all what it had to do with me. ""She came here and told me, 'I'm 80% sure that your mum is Tony's mother.' Well you could have knocked me over with a feather, I knew nothing about it! ""I thought, 'How could my mum have done it?' And then I thought, 'What must she have been through to feel she had to do something like that?' If only she'd been able to talk to us."" Mary with Sheena's father Sheena agreed to take the test and it confirmed Sheena was indeed Tony's half-sister. Julia went to Tony's house to tell him the news. ""When she came I had a friend with me, who was writing it all down. It was a hell of a lot to absorb,"" Tony says. ""It was strange, I felt much less happy than I thought I would do. It didn't have as huge an effect as I thought it would. But then I heard Sheena was willing to meet me, that was a big bonus."" Sheena and her husband, George Haig, only live an hour's drive away from Tony and they agreed to meet him and Julia at a hotel. ""I just thought it was unbelievable. That I'm hugging the daughter of the woman who abandoned me and that she had been prepared to meet me,"" Tony says. ""Sheena gave me an album full of old photographs of the family. It was just lovely. She's a great girl."" Sheena, Tony, and the family photos Sheena immediately noticed something familiar about Tony. ""He walked in and I thought: 'That's my mum walking towards me.' He was so much like her it was scary. I just couldn't take my eyes off him."" Over time, Sheena, 65, has helped Tony build a picture of their mother. Mary married Sheena's father in 1946 and had two children. They moved to Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe, when Sheena was two. However, they came back to the UK after her father was injured in a car accident. He never left hospital and Mary raised Peter and Sheena alone. Sheena as a young woman, and Mary ""She had a hard life but she was a loving person. She'd do anything for anybody,"" Sheena says. ""I've missed her more this year than I've done in a long time."" Meanwhile, Julia was still at work trying to find Tony's biological father. She discovered Mary had been married once before, which was a complete surprise to Sheena. ""Julia told us mum had married a man from Kirkcaldy called James on 1 August 1942, but she applied for a divorce in 1946,"" she says. As Tony was born in late November or early December, Julia knew Mary would have been about five months pregnant at the time of the wedding. Although the DNA hadn't indicated a strong Scottish lineage on Tony's paternal side, Julia decided to follow up the lead. She found out that James had gone on to remarry after his divorce from Mary and had had a daughter called Anita. When Anita was approached and told about Tony's story, her response took everyone by surprise. ""Her first words to us were along the lines of: 'Thank goodness he's fine,'"" Julia says. Anita says discovering the existence of Tony has laid to rest a family mystery that had troubled her for most of her life. ""I'd heard a whisper of a story but I was never sure it was true,"" she says. ""I was anything between eight and 10. I heard raised voices and I was listening at the door. I just heard, 'Oh, it's awful you know that a baby was left.' That would have been my mother speaking and my father was saying things like, 'You weren't there. It was dreadful, she was in a terrible state and she was going to jump off a bridge and I had to calm her down.'"" The young Mary Hunter It's not clear if James knew Mary was pregnant when they got married, but Anita says her father insisted the baby wasn't his. Her understanding was that this led to some sort of argument between James and Mary in London. At the time, James was in the military and serving on the south coast. Perhaps Mary came down with the baby from Kirkcaldy to meet him? ""I suppose that's how the abandonment happened,"" Anita says. ""My father removed Madie [Mary] from the baby to calm her down and perhaps - I think I remember hearing my mum saying something like 'Did you never go back to see if it was still there?' And I remember him saying 'Of course I did, but obviously the baby wasn't there.'"" This is a second-hand account, told decades later, but it does suggest that both Mary and James were involved in leaving Tony on Victoria Embankment. An action that their children think profoundly affected both of them for the rest of their lives. Mary had always told her daughter, Sheena, that her brother, Peter, had been a twin, but that the other baby had been stillborn. Sheena's cousin recently revealed she'd once asked their gran about the stillborn baby. ""My gran had been there at Peter's birth and apparently she said that was a load of rubbish, there was only one baby. So we now think that was my mum trying to make sense of it,"" Sheena says. Mary with Sheena as a young girl Anita said her father, James, was delighted when she had three girls and seemed uncomfortable around baby boys. ""He was a very supportive and helpful person. It just seems such an out-of-character thing for him and I think it weighed heavily on him,"" she says. ""In fact, in his late 70s he tried to take his own life and was treated for severe depression. I think the incident in 1942 with the baby [is something] he'd carried all those years and felt guilt and shame for. I think it contributed to his suicide attempt."" Both Sheena and Anita wish their parents could have known that Tony had been found and adopted. Anita took a DNA test that confirmed what her father had always said, he was not Tony's father. So Julia's hunt continued, looking at DNA databases and creating numerous family trees using birth, marriage and death records. She narrowed down her search to two family lines based in Yorkshire and Hertfordshire. This meant he was unlikely to be a GI as Tony had first supposed. Eric Wisbey emigrated to Australia Then, just a few months after finding Tony's mother, Julia hit the jackpot with his father. She discovered a 1906 marriage that seemed to bring those two lines together. The marriage resulted in a son called Eric. ""I found this man called Eric Wisbey who looked to me to be the dad. I approached some living relatives who told me he had gone to Australia,"" Julia says. ""Eric had died in 2004 and he had a son called Ken who had died in 2011. But Ken had a daughter called Leesa and she agreed to do a DNA test."" Leesa lives in Wodonga, on the border of New South Wales and Victoria. ""I Googled Julia Bell's name to make sure that it wasn't a hoax,"" she says over Skype. ""You never know nowadays. And then I thought, 'Well, it's not going to hurt me.' So I agreed and she sent the test over."" The results came back a month later and confirmed Leesa was Tony's half-niece. This meant Julia was correct and Eric Wisbey was Tony's father. Starting in 2016, Julia Bell identified cousins of Tony on his mother's side, and used them to reconstruct part of his family tree, which led her to Mary, Tony's mother, and to Sheena, his living half-sister, whom Julia met in January 2019. In her search for Tony's father, Julia established that Mary's first husband, James, had been present when Tony was abandoned, but was not his father. Her attention then focused on two families in Yorkshire and Hertfordshire and a man called Eric Wisbey. When Eric's granddaughter, Leesa, did a DNA test in spring 2019, the result showed she was Tony's half-niece, and the case was closed. Tony was amazed to discover he had family on the other side of the world. ""I have got a father that went out to Australia and now I've spoken to my father's granddaughter out there over the internet. These are huge bonuses,"" he says. Leesa was able to tell Tony a little about his father. ""Eric was sort of a reserved fella, sometimes he'd take my brother, dad and I fishing,"" she says. He was a painter and decorator who moved around the state of Victoria. After his wife, Leesa's grandmother, died, he married one of her friends. But how did Eric Wisbey, from the south of England, come to meet Mary Hunter from Scotland? Leesa pulled out her grandfather's war records, which revealed he was in the Army Pay Corps in World War Two. In 1942 he was stationed in Edinburgh, 11 miles across the Firth of Forth from Mary's hometown of Kirkcaldy. At the time Mary was 22 and living with her parents, while Eric was 35 and married with a young son back in Brighton. So how did this unlikely couple get together? Mary's brother, Bill - who has since died aged 93 - was asked if he could remember anything from that time. Who were my parents - and why was I left on a hillside to die? The mystery of the baby in the box The Christmas present that could tear your family apart I met my boyfriend 12 years after giving birth to his child ""He remembered an older guy coming to stay at the house because he had to share a room with him,"" Sheena says. ""He was 15 years or so older than my mum and he said he thinks she'd had an affair with him. But he doesn't remember her being pregnant or a baby being born."" Sheena and George have speculated that Eric was billeted with the Hunter family, and was perhaps involved in paying the munition workers in the town. But did Eric ever find out that Mary was pregnant? Leesa reveals a tantalising clue. ""I had rung my mum to tell her about what was going on with Julia and then mum spoke to John, who was my dad's friend. And John said Dad had told him he thought he had a half-brother or had an inkling. I don't know how Dad got that information. I wish he was still alive so we could ask him about it."" Eric Wisbey left Scotland in 1943 after he moved from the Pays Corps to the Intelligence Corps. By 1944 he was stationed in India. ""He didn't really like speaking about the war and we never asked him about it. We found his records in a drawer,"" Leesa says. Sheena thinks her mother was left in an impossible position. ""Whether he knew about it or not, Eric was married and quite a lot older than my mum. Then he went off to Australia. I think he got off scot free,"" she says. ""I feel angry and bitter that my mum felt she had to hide it all. What she must have gone through for the rest of her life, to my mind, is absolutely heart-breaking."" For Tony, the discoveries have helped him better understand why he was left on the Embankment. But he says he has never blamed his mother for leaving him. ""I wish I could tell her 'I'm sorry you had to do it,'"" he says. ""I was sure she wouldn't have abandoned me without a damn good reason."" Dr Marilyn Crawshaw from the University of York has worked for decades with people who were adopted or conceived with donor sperm. She warns people to think carefully before embarking on a journey like Tony's. ""I very definitely believe a child has a right to know where they come from,"" she says. ""But I always say to people don't go rushing into it, stop and think first. Talk to your mates about it. Are you prepared for all the different things you might find out? ""Some bits might feel immensely satisfying, but you may also find a birth parent who refuses to have contact with you. You have no idea what is happening in the lives of the people you are approaching. You really are stepping into the unknown."" Tony says there are some things he will always wonder about, such as whether he was born in Scotland or London, but he is ""happy to know what I now know"". His relationship with his half-sister has gone from strength to strength. Sheena and her husband, George, have met Tony's sister, Eleanor, while Tony has gone to watch his half-niece, Jessica, sing at a concert in London. Tony is now looking forward to introducing Sheena and her family to his children and grandchildren. ""When Julia first told me she had a result I think I was a bit stunned,"" Tony says. ""But now I've met my half-sister, I've corresponded with my half-niece in Australia. I'm looking forward to introducing my son and daughter to Sheena's family. It's given me a new lease of life.""

"Urumqi is being subjected to what are now typical Chinese lockdown measures for outbreaks A ""wartime state"" has been declared in Urumqi, the capital of China's western Xinjiang region, after a spike in cases of coronavirus. Officials on Saturday said 17 new cases had been recorded and strict measures on movement had been imposed. Although the figure appears low, China has recorded very few significant outbreaks since Covid-19 emerged in the city of Wuhan late last year. China is now not in the top 20 in terms of either infections or deaths. Wuhan - city of silence What did China do about early outbreak? Did China test a whole city in 10 days? It has recorded just over 85,000 infections and 4,600 fatalities,according to Johns Hopkins university research,external. The capital of the Xinjiang Autonomous Region has a population of about 3.5 million. The latest infections began to be detected on Wednesday, the first in the region for months, prompting the cancellation of almost all flights in and out of the city. Subway services were also suspended. On Saturday, officials said the total of cases was 17. One official told a state briefing: ""The whole city has entered a 'wartime state', and will suspend all kinds of group activities."" The latest lockdown measures include: Mass screening in buildings where new cases have been detected, later expanding to the whole of Urumqi Visits to other households are restricted, as are large gatherings Residents urged not to leave the city unless absolutely necessary and must be tested if they do Rui Baoling, the director of the disease control and prevention, said the main cluster had been detected in the Tianshan district of Urumqi but although the ""epidemic has developed rapidly"", she added that the ""situation is generally controllable"". Xinjiang has this week reported another 23 cases listed as ""asymptomatic"", with 269 people under ""medical observation"". The vast majority of coronavirus deaths and most of the infections in China occurred in Wuhan at the start of the year. Since then, the only large-scale cluster was reported in June in Beijing, where more than 330 people were infected before the outbreak was contained. However, some have questioned China's reporting of numbers on the outbreak. This video can not be played Paul Adams asks whether China is being bolder in the wake of the pandemic China has certainly taken tough measures to prevent any outbreak expanding, imposing strict controls where necessary, including shutting transport and introducing mass testing. For Friday, only 22 new cases were reported for the whole of mainland China, and that includes 16 of Urumqi's cases. To put this in perspective, Florida on Saturday registered a rise of more than 10,000 cases. Xinjiang is home to the mainly Muslim Uighur people and other Turkic minorities and is subject to intense state control. The BBC's China correspondent Stephen McDonell says there is the added sensitivity of controversial detention camps where hundreds of thousands of mostly ethnic Uighurs have been interned as part of a mass ""de-radicalisation"" programme. He says if the coronavirus got into one of those camps the same way it has in prisons, the possibility of widespread infection would be considerable. Xinjiang is one of a number of issues that have contributed to worsening US-China relations. China's hidden camps Last week, the Trump administration announced sanctions against Chinese politicians who it says are responsible for human rights violations against Muslim minorities in Xinjiang. China rejects the accusations. On Thursday, foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying invited US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to visit Xinjiang to see for himself that there were no such violations.

"The funeral of a man shot dead by police after stabbing six people in Glasgow was delayed after more than 100 people turned up to the ceremony. The funeral for Badreddin Abadlla Adam was due to start at Linn Cemetery at 14:00 but police were called when a crowd breached Covid-19 rules. The 28-year-old from Sudan was shot by officers after wounding six people. PC David Whyte, 42, was among thoseinjured during the attack at the Park Inn Hotel on 26 June.. The Scottish government's current rules allow for a maximum of 20 guests at funeral services. A Police Scotland spokeswoman said officers were in attendance ""assisting staff with social distancing regulations"". At the time of his knife attack, Adam was being temporarily housed in the hotel that was being used as accommodation for asylum seekers during the coronavirus pandemic. He was described as a ""quiet and polite and decent guy"" by asylum seekers who were also residing at the city centre hotel. The burial ceremony took place in Glasgow Fellow resident, Andrew, said: ""One way or the other we have been affected mentally, physically and otherwise. ""I (was not) around when it took place but I happened to gather some information from my other asylum seekers. ""They described him as a quiet and polite and decent guy - they were surprised that he acted the way he acted. ""There must be something that pushed him to behave in that ugly manner which honestly I strongly condemned because it is abnormal, but definitely something must have pushed that guy into that level of disastrous act."" PC Whyte, one of the attacker's six injured victims, paid tribute to police and medical staff after being discharged from hospital a week after the attack. ""There is no doubt that I face a long road to recovery but I am absolutely determined to be back on duty as soon as I possibly can,"" he said. ""I would like to thank the medical staff at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital for saving my life and getting me back to where I am today.""

"Sheikh Sabah has ruled Kuwait since 2006 The crown prince of Kuwait has taken on the role of partial ruler after the country's emir was hospitalised. Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah, 91, was admitted for ""routine"" medical tests on Saturday, the country's national news agency said. The report added he was in ""good health"" but gave no further details. His half-brother and crown prince, 83-year-old Sheikh Nawaf al-Ahmad al-Sabah, will ""temporarily"" take on a number of functions. Last summer, the emir was reported to have suffered a health ""setback"" while in Kuwait. The following month, he was hospitalised for medical tests during a visit to the US. Sheikh Sabah has been credited with shaping the Gulf nation's foreign policy and spent decades as foreign minister before becoming emir in 2006.

"Twitter has confirmed hackers made use of tools that were supposed to have only been available to its own staff to carry off Wednesday's hack attack. The breach saw the accounts of Barack Obama, Elon Musk, Kanye West and Bill Gates among other celebrities used to tweet a Bitcoin scam. Twitter also revealed,externalthe perpetrators had downloaded data from up to eight of the accounts involved. It declined to reveal their identities but said none of them were ""verified"". This means they did not have a blue tick to confirm their ownership, and thus were not among the most high-profile hacked accounts. However, the fact the attackers were able to make use of the Your Twitter Data download toolmeans they now potentially have access to,externalaffected users': private direct messages, including photos and videos contacts, which Twitter's app would have imported from their smartphone address books physical location history, logged at times they had used the service details about the accounts they had muted and blocked interest and demographic information Twitter had inferred about them via their use of its platform In a further development, the New York Times has suggested that the social network became exposed after the hackers gained access to credentials that had been shared on Twitter's internal Slack messaging channel - a service that some companies use as an alternative to email. The newspaper also suggests that at least two of those involved are from England. In total, Twitter said 130 accounts had been targeted, of which the hackers had managed to reset the passwords of 45, giving them control. It added that it believed those responsible may have attempted to sell some of the pilfered usernames. ""The attackers successfully manipulated a small number of employees and used their credentials to access Twitter's internal systems,"" it said in a statement. ""We are continuing our investigation of this incident, working with law enforcement, and determining longer-term actions we should take to improve the security of our systems."" It added: ""We're embarrassed, we're disappointed, and more than anything, we're sorry."" Twitter said the attackers had targeted certain Twitter employees through a ""social engineering scheme"". ""In this context, social engineering is the intentional manipulation of people into performing certain actions and divulging confidential information,"" it said. A small number of staff had been successfully manipulated, it said. Once inside Twitter's internal systems, the hackers were not able to see users' previous passwords but could access personal information including email addresses and phone numbers as these are visible to staff using internal support tools. Listen to Tech Tent: The big Twitter hack Twitter hack: What went wrong and why it matters What is Bitcoin? They may also have been able to view additional information, the company said. There has been speculation that this could include direct messages. The private messages of Kanye West, Kim Kardashian West or Elon Musk could be worth money on dark web forums. Selling the private messages of presidential hopeful Joe Biden or former mayor of New York Michael Bloomberg could also have political consequences. It is not clear why the hackers did not download all the data of these celebrity accounts but did so for others. Twitter is ""actively working on communicating directly"" with the affected users, its statement said. It is also continuing to restore access for other users still locked out of their accounts as a result of the firm's initial response to the hack. On 15 July, a number of Bitcoin-related accounts began tweeting what appeared to be a simple Bitcoin scam, promising to ""give back"" to the community by doubling any Bitcoin sent to their address. Then, the apparent scam spread to high-profile accounts such as Kim Kardashian West and Joe Biden, and those of corporations Apple and Uber. Twitter scrambled to contain the unprecedented attack, temporarily preventing all verified users - those with a blue tick on their accounts - from tweeting. However, US President Donald Trump, one of the most prominent Twitter users, was unaffected. There has been speculation for some time that President Trump has extra protections in placeafter his account was deactivated by an employee on their last day of work in 2017. The New York Times confirmed that was how Mr Trump's account escaped the attack,external, citing an anonymous White House official and a separate Twitter employee. Despite the fact that the scam was obvious to some, the attackers received hundreds of transfers, worth more than $100,000 (Â£80,000). Bitcoin is extremely hard to trace and the three separate crypto-currency wallets that the cyber-criminals used have already been emptied. The digital money is likely to be split into smaller amounts and run through so-called ""mixer"" or ""tumbler"" services to make it even harder to trace back to the attackers. This video can not be played Bitcoin explained: How do cryptocurrencies work? Clues about those responsible have surfaced through bragging on social media - including on Twitter itself. Earlier this week, researchers at cyber-crime intelligence firm Hudson Rock spotted an advert on a hacker forum claiming to be able to steal any Twitter account by changing the email address to which it is linked. The seller also posted a screenshot of the panel usually reserved for high-level Twitter employees. It appeared to allow full control of adding an email to an account or ""detaching"" existing ones. Hackers posted the view from the Twitter control panel This means that the attackers had access to the back end of Twitter at least 36-48 hours before the Bitcoin scams began appearing on Wednesday evening. The researchers have also linked at least one Twitter account to the hack, which has now been suspended.

"Photographs from Princess Beatrice's wedding to property tycoon Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi have been released by Buckingham Palace. Four official pictures have been issued after their small ceremony at The Royal Chapel of All Saints in Windsor. One shows the beaming couple leaving the chapel through its flower-covered archway. In another they are outside the entrance with Beatrice's grandparents, the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh. Princess Beatrice marries in private ceremony Who is Beatrice's husband Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi? Royal Family tree and line of succession Beatrice's parents, the Duke and Duchess of York, did not appear in either of the released photos, though the palace confirmed her father walked her down the aisle. It comes as Prince Andrew continues to keep a low profile following the arrest of his former friend Ghislaine Maxwell for sex trafficking offences, which she denies. The Queen loaned Beatrice a vintage dress for the occasion, as well as a diamond fringe tiara which the monarch wore on her own wedding day in 1947. The newlyweds decided to hold a private ceremony with their parents and siblings after they postponed their wedding in May due to the coronavirus pandemic. Buckingham Palace sent out two pictures taken by Benjamin Wheeler, the day after Friday's wedding. Two further images by the Oxfordshire-based photographer - showing the couple holding hands in the grounds outside the chapel after they were married - were issued on Sunday. In a statement the couple said they were  so ""touched by the warm wishes they have received since their wedding"" they decided to share two more photographs from their ""happy day"". When the national lockdown began on 23 March, weddings in England were banned under almost all circumstances. However, since 4 July, ceremonies of up to 30 people have been allowed to take place. In a statement, the palace said the wedding was held within government guidelines. It is believed to be the first time the Queen, 94, and Prince Philip, 99, have attended a family gathering since lockdown began. For the ceremony, Beatrice wore a vintage Peau De Soie taffeta dress, in shades of ivory by Norman Hartnell, on loan from the Queen, and trimmed with duchess satin and encrusted with diamante. The dress appears to be a modified version of the one the Queen wore to the world premiere of Lawrence Of Arabia at the Odeon cinema Leicester Square in December 1962 The dress was remodelled and fitted by the Queen's senior dresser Angela Kelly and designer Stewart Parvin, according to Buckingham Palace. Beatrice, who is ninth in line to the throne, also wore the Queen Mary diamond fringe tiara loaned to her by her grandmother. The Queen wore the same tiara when she married Prince Philip in November 1947 Beatrice, 31, and Mr Mapelli Mozzi, 35, had originally planned to marry on 29 May this year at the Chapel Royal, St James Palace, in London. The new venue of Royal Lodge in Windsor Great Park - a short drive from Windsor Castle - is Beatrice's childhood home. Her parents still live at the property. Mr Mapelli Mozzi's son Wolfie was best man and pageboy. Beatrice and her husband began dating in autumn 2018 and got engaged last September. The couple are said to have started a relationship after meeting again at Beatrice's sister Princess Eugenie's wedding to Jack Brooksbank. After Friday's ceremony, Beatrice's wedding bouquet was placed on the tomb of the unknown warrior in Westminster Abbey, as is tradition for royal brides. The bouquet was fashioned out of trailing jasmine, pale pink and cream sweet peas, royal porcelain ivory spray roses, pink O'Hara garden roses, pink wax flower, baby pink astilbe and, in keeping with royal tradition, sprigs of myrtle. The Reverend Canon Anthony Ball laid the bouquet with Toby Wright, the son of the sub-dean of the Chapel Royal, Reverend Paul Wright. All photos subject to copyright.

"People wearing face masks as they shop at an open fruit and vegetable market in Leicester Councils in England have been given new powers to close shops, cancel events and shut outdoor public spaces to manage local outbreaks of coronavirus. The PM said the move would enable councils to respond more quickly to outbreaks ""where speed is paramount"". The Local Government Association said it hoped it would prevent the need for stricter local lockdown measures. Meanwhile, a government scientific adviser has warned a return to pre-lockdown life remains ""a long way off"". A further 40 coronavirus deathshave been announced,external, taking the total number of people who have died after testing positive for coronavirus in the UK to 45,273. Announcing the new powers for councils, Prime Minister Boris Johnson told Friday's Downing Street press briefing: ""It has to be right that we take local action in response to local outbreaks - there is no point shutting down a city in one part of the country to contain an outbreak in another part of the country"". Mr Johnson also said ministers would receive clearer guidance on where they can intervene to ""close whole sectors or types of premises in an area"" and advise people in specific postcodes to stay at home. Plan for 'significant normality' by Christmas - PM What will close if there's a lockdown where I live?,external Lockdown approach 'less effective' for BAME groups Government guidance says the move""significantly"" increases councils' powers,external, and as such, should be used ""with discretion"". Mr Johnson said the additional powers would allow local authorities ""to act more quickly in response to outbreaks where speed is paramount"", in what he called ""lightning lockdowns"". This video can not be played PM announces powers to tackle local outbreaks James Jamieson, chairman of the LGA, which represents council leaders in England, welcomed the announcement, saying the extra powers will hopefully lessen the need for stricter measures being introduced locally. ""Councils know their local communities best and know how to address each unique outbreak,"" Mr Jamieson said. He added that the use of enforcement powers ""should be an option of last resort"" and called for more ""granular-level data"" to be made available to councils to allow them to be ""better able to act in real time to increases in infection rates"". Liverpool City Region mayor Steve Rotheram said more detailed data, such as the daily number of people reporting symptoms, would enable councils to target messaging to certain groups, for example younger people in a particular area. ""The messaging, therefore, might be that we use some of our footballers to get the message over not to go out or to wear face masks or coverings,"" he said. ""It really is about making certain that we can get the correct message to the right people at the right time."" Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told the BBC the government would provide daily updates to local areas. He said there had been ""issues"" with data sharing because of the General Data Protection Regulation rules. ""We've been working through all of that to put these local agreements in place and that will help dramatically,"" the transport secretary told Radio 4's Today programme. Government 'playing games' with Leicester lockdown 'Lockdown confusion wrecked our holiday' Lockdown 'should be lifted in 90% of Leicester' The new powers for councils came as theprime minister set out a ""roadmap"" for a return to ""normality"" by Christmasas part of an easing of the lockdown in England. Mr Johnson said it was his ""sincere hope"" the remaining restrictions could be reviewed in November, at the earliest, and possibly dropped by Christmas. From25 Julyindoor gyms, pools and other sports facilities can reopen On1 Augustthe government will update its advice on going to work, asking employers to make decisions about how and where their staff can work safely From the same date, most remaining leisure settings, including bowling, skating rinks, casinos and all close contact services, such as beauticians, will be allowed to reopen Live indoor theatre and concerts will be able to resume with socially distanced audiences Wedding receptions for up to 30 people will also be allowed from next month FromSeptember, schools, nurseries and colleges will be open for all children and young people on a full-time basis, while universities are also working to reopen as fully as possible FromOctober, the government intends to allow audiences to return to stadiums, while conferences and other business events can recommence, subject to the outcome of pilots But Prof John Edmunds, a member of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), told the BBC a return to pre-lockdown normality was ""a long way off"". ""If what you mean by normality is what we used to do until February and the middle of March this year - go to work normally, travel on the buses and trains, go on holiday without restrictions, meet friends, shake hands, hug each other and so on - that's a long way off, unfortunately,"" he told the Today programme. ""We won't be able to do that until we are immune to the virus, which means until we have a vaccine that is proven safe and effective. ""If we return to those sort of normal behaviours, the virus will come back very fast."" Also on Friday, the government dropped its advice to avoid public transport in England. Employers were also told it would be up to them to discuss with workers whether it was safe for them to return to workspaces from 1 August. Mr Shapps told BBC Breakfast the use of public transport was ""way down"" and there was spare capacity for people to return, even with social distancing. ""We're seeing in many cases quite empty, for example trains, particularly during the day, and we're saying actually there is more capacity there. You can now return - anybody, not just key workers, can now use public transport."" However, he advised people to continue to walk or cycle to work if they could.

"Urumqi is being subjected to what are now typical Chinese lockdown measures for outbreaks A ""wartime state"" has been declared in Urumqi, the capital of China's western Xinjiang region, after a spike in cases of coronavirus. Officials on Saturday said 17 new cases had been recorded and strict measures on movement had been imposed. Although the figure appears low, China has recorded very few significant outbreaks since Covid-19 emerged in the city of Wuhan late last year. China is now not in the top 20 in terms of either infections or deaths. Wuhan - city of silence What did China do about early outbreak? Did China test a whole city in 10 days? It has recorded just over 85,000 infections and 4,600 fatalities,according to Johns Hopkins university research,external. The capital of the Xinjiang Autonomous Region has a population of about 3.5 million. The latest infections began to be detected on Wednesday, the first in the region for months, prompting the cancellation of almost all flights in and out of the city. Subway services were also suspended. On Saturday, officials said the total of cases was 17. One official told a state briefing: ""The whole city has entered a 'wartime state', and will suspend all kinds of group activities."" The latest lockdown measures include: Mass screening in buildings where new cases have been detected, later expanding to the whole of Urumqi Visits to other households are restricted, as are large gatherings Residents urged not to leave the city unless absolutely necessary and must be tested if they do Rui Baoling, the director of the disease control and prevention, said the main cluster had been detected in the Tianshan district of Urumqi but although the ""epidemic has developed rapidly"", she added that the ""situation is generally controllable"". Xinjiang has this week reported another 23 cases listed as ""asymptomatic"", with 269 people under ""medical observation"". The vast majority of coronavirus deaths and most of the infections in China occurred in Wuhan at the start of the year. Since then, the only large-scale cluster was reported in June in Beijing, where more than 330 people were infected before the outbreak was contained. However, some have questioned China's reporting of numbers on the outbreak. This video can not be played Paul Adams asks whether China is being bolder in the wake of the pandemic China has certainly taken tough measures to prevent any outbreak expanding, imposing strict controls where necessary, including shutting transport and introducing mass testing. For Friday, only 22 new cases were reported for the whole of mainland China, and that includes 16 of Urumqi's cases. To put this in perspective, Florida on Saturday registered a rise of more than 10,000 cases. Xinjiang is home to the mainly Muslim Uighur people and other Turkic minorities and is subject to intense state control. The BBC's China correspondent Stephen McDonell says there is the added sensitivity of controversial detention camps where hundreds of thousands of mostly ethnic Uighurs have been interned as part of a mass ""de-radicalisation"" programme. He says if the coronavirus got into one of those camps the same way it has in prisons, the possibility of widespread infection would be considerable. Xinjiang is one of a number of issues that have contributed to worsening US-China relations. China's hidden camps Last week, the Trump administration announced sanctions against Chinese politicians who it says are responsible for human rights violations against Muslim minorities in Xinjiang. China rejects the accusations. On Thursday, foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying invited US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to visit Xinjiang to see for himself that there were no such violations.

"When you have picked your jaw up from the floor after the revelations hackers working for the Russian state are believed to have been trying to steal research into a vaccine that could combat the spread of the deadly coronavirus, it's worth knowing that attempts at interference do not stop there. Those actions - described as ""despicable"" by the government - are believed to have targeted, not just UK scientists, but those from Canada and the US as well. And it's clear, even from the rather technical public statements from security leaders, that the UK government believes the Kremlin itself was involved. Russia 'interference' report to be published Raab: 'Almost certain' Russians sought to interfere in 2019 UK election Russian spies target Covid-19 vaccine research This is not a group of hackers working out of their parents' garage. The group thought to be responsible - APT29 - is one of those previously linked to hacks on the US Democrats in 2016. And the UK government is confident the attacks were known about at the highest level of the Russian state. Ministers also chose today, though, to confirm already widely held suspicions that Russian ""actors"" separately tried to interfere in the UK election last year. This accusation is not explicitly against the Russian state, but those shadowy figures who ""amplified"" leaks of government documents during the 2019 campaign, which were then used by the Labour Party to make claims against the Tories. It seems a lifetime ago, but one of Labour's central mantras against Boris Johnson was that the NHS would be ""up for sale"" in a trade deal with the Americans. You might remember hearing the chant at numerous events - ""Not for sale! Not for sale!"" At one of those campaign events,Jeremy Corbyn dramatically unveiled leaked documentsthat he alleged proved this to be the case. Labour supporting doctors and nurses wearing scrubs even handed out the reams of paper. The papers did show that the US wanted access to the NHS, but they did not categorically prove that the Tories would go along with it. In any case, there waswidespread suspicionabout where the hundreds of pages had come from, after they had first appeared on the website Reddit. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has not claimed today that Russian influences stole the documents. But he has accused them of ""amplifying"" the claims online, condemning these attempts at interfering in the UK's democratic process as ""completely unacceptable"". It's important to say too that Labour has also slammed the Russians' apparent role. It's not a secret that there have been attempts by Russia to interfere in what happens on UK soil - most dramatically, of course, with the Novichok attacks. And the culture select committee found some evidence of media aligned with the Kremlin spreading anti-EU messages during the EU referendum. Rumours and allegations have swirled about Russian attempted influence for years, although the extent of what has gone on has never been clear. Despite many suspicions of attempts at meddling in the referendum and other campaigns, significant concrete evidence is in short supply. That's one of the reasons why, until today, UK ministers have stopped short of saying that political interference has happened here. So, it matters that this is the first time a UK minister has made an explicit link to Russia, in one way or another, trying to meddle in elections in the UK. But the timing of that statement creates its own intrigue too. Dominic Raab announced the Russian interference earlier Next week, at long last, the powerful group of MPs who monitor UK intelligence will publish a report on the Russian threat to the UK - a report that has been anticipated for a very long time and may perhaps set the record straight on all of this. It's been produced by an independent committee who are able to access and interrogate intelligence information. The report was completed many months ago, and while No 10 has continually denied there is anything fishy, it has been sitting on the prime minister's desk for a long time. The Tories' attempts to install a loyal chairman of the committee backfired spectacularly yesterday,which you can read about here. Now, the report itself, which looks at the spectrum of the threat that Russia may pose to the UK -  the financial influence of wealthy Russians in the country, what happened in Salisbury, attempts at meddling in political campaigns and more - will be published next week. Is it politically convenient for ministers to acknowledge the threat themselves just before others may make embarrassing claims about it? Labour politicians have frequently accused the Conservatives of ignoring Russian interference because of their relationship with Tory Party donors. Did it suit the government to publicise the claims that material used by Labour was also manipulated by Russia? It seems, as one former UK ambassador to Moscow said this afternoon, a ""remarkable coincidence"" that the government decided at this moment to admit explicitly, for the first time, that Russia has tried to stick its nose into our politics - especially when there is a running criminal investigation into who obtained the documents to start with. But Downing Street denies that there is any link in the timing at all. Whatever shenanigans there may have been about the timing of these announcements, it is clear there is cause to be anxious about Russia's attitude to the UK. Boris Johnson once hoped, as foreign secretary, that he could reset the UK's relations with Vladimir Putin. Today's evidence suggests that what he did get right was his own later admission that he was wrong.

"When you have picked your jaw up from the floor after the revelations hackers working for the Russian state are believed to have been trying to steal research into a vaccine that could combat the spread of the deadly coronavirus, it's worth knowing that attempts at interference do not stop there. Those actions - described as ""despicable"" by the government - are believed to have targeted, not just UK scientists, but those from Canada and the US as well. And it's clear, even from the rather technical public statements from security leaders, that the UK government believes the Kremlin itself was involved. Russia 'interference' report to be published Raab: 'Almost certain' Russians sought to interfere in 2019 UK election Russian spies target Covid-19 vaccine research This is not a group of hackers working out of their parents' garage. The group thought to be responsible - APT29 - is one of those previously linked to hacks on the US Democrats in 2016. And the UK government is confident the attacks were known about at the highest level of the Russian state. Ministers also chose today, though, to confirm already widely held suspicions that Russian ""actors"" separately tried to interfere in the UK election last year. This accusation is not explicitly against the Russian state, but those shadowy figures who ""amplified"" leaks of government documents during the 2019 campaign, which were then used by the Labour Party to make claims against the Tories. It seems a lifetime ago, but one of Labour's central mantras against Boris Johnson was that the NHS would be ""up for sale"" in a trade deal with the Americans. You might remember hearing the chant at numerous events - ""Not for sale! Not for sale!"" At one of those campaign events,Jeremy Corbyn dramatically unveiled leaked documentsthat he alleged proved this to be the case. Labour supporting doctors and nurses wearing scrubs even handed out the reams of paper. The papers did show that the US wanted access to the NHS, but they did not categorically prove that the Tories would go along with it. In any case, there waswidespread suspicionabout where the hundreds of pages had come from, after they had first appeared on the website Reddit. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has not claimed today that Russian influences stole the documents. But he has accused them of ""amplifying"" the claims online, condemning these attempts at interfering in the UK's democratic process as ""completely unacceptable"". It's important to say too that Labour has also slammed the Russians' apparent role. It's not a secret that there have been attempts by Russia to interfere in what happens on UK soil - most dramatically, of course, with the Novichok attacks. And the culture select committee found some evidence of media aligned with the Kremlin spreading anti-EU messages during the EU referendum. Rumours and allegations have swirled about Russian attempted influence for years, although the extent of what has gone on has never been clear. Despite many suspicions of attempts at meddling in the referendum and other campaigns, significant concrete evidence is in short supply. That's one of the reasons why, until today, UK ministers have stopped short of saying that political interference has happened here. So, it matters that this is the first time a UK minister has made an explicit link to Russia, in one way or another, trying to meddle in elections in the UK. But the timing of that statement creates its own intrigue too. Dominic Raab announced the Russian interference earlier Next week, at long last, the powerful group of MPs who monitor UK intelligence will publish a report on the Russian threat to the UK - a report that has been anticipated for a very long time and may perhaps set the record straight on all of this. It's been produced by an independent committee who are able to access and interrogate intelligence information. The report was completed many months ago, and while No 10 has continually denied there is anything fishy, it has been sitting on the prime minister's desk for a long time. The Tories' attempts to install a loyal chairman of the committee backfired spectacularly yesterday,which you can read about here. Now, the report itself, which looks at the spectrum of the threat that Russia may pose to the UK -  the financial influence of wealthy Russians in the country, what happened in Salisbury, attempts at meddling in political campaigns and more - will be published next week. Is it politically convenient for ministers to acknowledge the threat themselves just before others may make embarrassing claims about it? Labour politicians have frequently accused the Conservatives of ignoring Russian interference because of their relationship with Tory Party donors. Did it suit the government to publicise the claims that material used by Labour was also manipulated by Russia? It seems, as one former UK ambassador to Moscow said this afternoon, a ""remarkable coincidence"" that the government decided at this moment to admit explicitly, for the first time, that Russia has tried to stick its nose into our politics - especially when there is a running criminal investigation into who obtained the documents to start with. But Downing Street denies that there is any link in the timing at all. Whatever shenanigans there may have been about the timing of these announcements, it is clear there is cause to be anxious about Russia's attitude to the UK. Boris Johnson once hoped, as foreign secretary, that he could reset the UK's relations with Vladimir Putin. Today's evidence suggests that what he did get right was his own later admission that he was wrong.

To recap, some of the main developments we've reported on are:  Today's live page was written and edited by Lauren Turner, Paul Kirby, Sophie Williams, Alex Therrien, Joseph Lee and George Wright. Here's a round-up of the main stories of the day in the UK: BBC MonitoringThe world through its media An Iranian woman stands next to a street bin in the capital Tehran Iran has recorded around 20,000 more deaths this spring than previous years, according to government figures. Iran's National Organisation for Civil Registration recorded 110,384 deaths in the spring - based on the Iranian calendar year from 20 March to 20 June - the ISNA news agency reports. The deaths recorded in the spring of the preceding three years were 93,067, 90,214 and 91,742 respectively. Iran says just under 14,000 have died of coronavirus, but some observers think the real tally could be far higher. Iranâs President Hassan Rouhani has said 25 million Iranians have already been infected by coronavirus and another 35 million are at risk. Basing his statistics on a health ministry report, he warned the country would need twice as many beds. Until now, the official number of infections was 269,440. Bathers crowd on a beach on the Baltic Sea in Scharbeutz in 2018 Summer has arrived on Germany's Baltic coast, but with that has brought huge crowds. This had an impact on the most popular areas in Scharbeutz and Haffkrug in the Bay of LÃ¼beck. The eight beaches in the area have been operating a traffic light system to keep the numbers down - and today some sections of beach and parking areas were temporarily closed because there was no longer enough free space for guests, the DPA news agency reports. More than 9,000 people have died of coronavirus in Germany. Four million residents of Barcelona have been urged to stay at home as cases rise Here's a summary of the top coronavirus developments from around the globe this evening. Seasonal workers, mostly from overseas, are delivered supplies as they remain in isolation on the farm England's strategy for this stage of the pandemic is to tackle outbreaks locally before they spread. One of those is a farm in Herefordshire, where seasonal workers are in self-isolation after 74 of them tested positive for the virus last week. Further tests uncovered 19 more people were infected, but Herefordshire Council has now said there is""no indication"" the outbreak had spread to the nearby community. The council's chief executive, Alistair Neill, said health officials and council staff were scrutinising nearby areas on ""an hour-by-hour, day-by-day basis"". He said there was still some way to go before the outbreak is over, but 70 workers at Rook Row Farm in Mathon had now recovered. It's not over until it's over, but Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz has given an upbeat message on the EU summit in Brussels, where the 27 member states are trying to agree a deal on a â¬750bn (Â£670bn) recovery fund of grants, subsidies and loans. ""Things are moving in the right direction,"" Kurz has told reporters, but he won't say whether he thinks a deal will be reached by tomorrow, or whether there'll have to be another meeting. The tricky part of the talks is how much of the money will be handed out as grants or subsidies - and then what conditions will be attached. The talks are set to go on - but for how long? Mr Kurz, whose country is one of the so-called ""frugal"" states, says the money has to go towards green projects, digitisation and reforms. And then the big question is whether other countries can have final approval. A big concession has reportedly been made to the Netherlands for an ""emergency brake"", allowing one country to trigger a review of another country's spending plans. These talks will go down to the wire, and quite possibly beyond. A ""wartime state"" has been declared in Urumqi, the capital of China's western Xinjiang region, after a spike in cases of coronavirus. On Saturday, officials said 17 new cases had been recorded and strict measures on movement had been imposed. Although the figure appears low, China has recorded very few significant outbreaks since Covid-19 emerged in the city of Wuhan late last year. China is now not in the top 20 in terms of either infections or deaths. Xinjiang is home to the mainly Muslim Uighur people and other Turkic minorities and is subject to intense state control. The latest lockdown measures in Urumqi include:  Russia's ambassador to the UK Andrey Kelin has denied claims that his country's spy agencies tried to steal research on coronavirus vaccines. In an interview for tomorrow's Andrew Marr Show on BBC One, Mr Kelin was asked if Russia had been stealing British vaccine research. âI donât think so, and I donât believe this story at all,"" he said. On Thursday,security services in the UK, Canada and the US warned that Russian spies were ""almost certainly"" behind hacking attackson organisations trying to develop a coronavirus vaccine. Mr Kelin also said his country wants to ""turn the page"" with the UK, more than two years after the Salisbury poisonings, in which a deadly nerve agent put five people in hospital and killed one. President Emmanuel Macron wore a mask at the EU summit in Brussels on Saturday Masks or face coverings are becoming compulsory in all sorts of indoor settings across Europe. In England, face coverings become mandatory in shops and supermarkets on 24 July. In France, new rules are coming in on Monday, but details so far have been vague - they referred only to closed public places. Health minister Olivier VÃ©ran has now explained that wearing a mask will be required in shops, public buildings, banks and covered markets. The full list will be detailed in a decree on Monday or Tuesday. Neighbouring Belgium made wearing masks in shops, libraries and cinemas compulsory on 11 July. Ireland has also made it compulsory in shops and shopping centres. Another 10,328 coronavirus cases have been reported in Florida, as well as a further 90 deaths, according to the state health department. It brings the overall total of cases to 337,569 and the number of deaths to 5,002. Current hospitalisations as of Saturday morning are 9,162 - up 194 in the past 24 hours, the state agency said. Florida is fast becoming America's latest Covid-19 epicentre, with a surge in cases being linked, in part, to younger Americans. You can read more here about how Florida became so badly affected by Covid-19. The Pride event in Frankfurt usually attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors Crowds have gathered for Frankfurt's Pride celebration, also known as Christopher Street Day. People attending the event wore face masks and kept to social distancing guidelines. Usually Frankfurt's Pride is a big affair. However the event this year is a lot smaller. People were seen wearing face masks and observing social distancing This year was a much smaller affair with several parts of the event moved online Crowds took part in the celebrations on Saturday Scotland has recorded 21 new cases of Covid-19 â its largest daily increase in since 21 June. It comes on a day that UK-wide infections also saw their largest daily rise since 1 July, with 827 new cases. But Scotland's national clinical director, Jason Leitch, told the BBCthe ""day-to-day variation"" was to be expected. He said he didn't believe the cases were part of a cluster, adding that ""21 in one small town would worry me much more than 21 spread around the country - and these 21 are spread around the country"". Eight of the cases are in the NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde area and five are in NHS Lothian. The border was reopened to the public on 21 June France is keeping a close eye on Spain as its southern neighbour experiences Covid-19 outbreaks just weeks after the border between the countries was reopened, French Prime Minister Jean Castex has said. Spanish health officials are monitoring more than 150 outbreaks across the country. But it's the north-eastern region of Catalonia that is seeing the biggest number of infections. Four million people in Barcelona have been asked to stay at home except for necessary trips for the next 15 days. Last weekend, residents in the district of SegriÃ  in western Catalonia were told to stay indoors and the outbreak then spread to L'Hospitalet de Llobregat, a city just to the south-west of Barcelona. ""We are monitoring this very closely, here in particular, because it is a real issue that we also need to discuss with the Spanish authorities,"" Castex said in response to a question about the possible closure of borders. The border was reopened to the public on 21 June. More than 30,000 people have died of the coronavirus in France, while 28,420 have died in Spain. The UK has recorded 40 new deaths in the last 24 hours and confirmed 827 new infections through Covid-19 testing. The latest figures were published onthe government's coronavirus dashboard,externaldespite concerns from Health Secretary Matt Hancock about the data from Public Health England. Officials said the Department for Health and Social Care will no longer link to the dashboard on social media posts or update the figures on the department's own coronavirus webpage while it conducts a review. PHE confirmed that it may be recording deaths from coronavirus even if people have died months after a positive test. Other UK nations only include those who died within 28 days of testing positive. But PHE saidit will continue to make the figures available and update the dashboard. Spain's north-eastern region of Catalonia has seen another 1,226 cases of Covid-19 reported in the past 24 hours, as public health authorities try to halt the spread. Restrictions on movement were brought back on Friday for four million people in the Barcelona area. They don't amount to a full lockdown, but residents are being urged to stay at home for the next 15 days. Not everyone was staying at home in Barcelona on Saturday This popular tourist city on the Med has now seen cinemas, theatres and nightclubs shut, with gatherings of more than 10 people banned. The Catalan health department says in the past 24 hours 349 cases have been reported in Barcelona itself and 894 in the whole metropolitan area - the health regions of Barcelona north and south. Asked whether France to the north was considering close the border, Prime Minister Jean Castex said he was monitoring the situation ""very closely"".  The UK's first local lockdown, in Leicester, is due to be relaxed next week Prime Minister Boris Johnson said new regulations allowing central government to impose local lockdowns will be published next week. He said they will allow ministers, ""where justified by the evidence"", to close whole industries or types of business in an area, introduce local stay-at-home orders, stop people entering or leaving specific areas, reduce the maximum gathering size, or restrict local transport. Ina series of Twitter posts,external, Mr Johnson said the strategy of ""targeted, local action"" is ""already working"". He pointed to outbreaks contained in Weston-super-Mare and Kirklees, work to tackle rising infections in Bradford and Blackburn, and the local lockdown in Leicester, which is due to be relaxed next week. But he saidnew powers given to local councils todayto rapidly tackle local outbreaks ""will not always be sufficient"". The prime minister acknowledged that ""it may seem unjust that people just a short distance away can live their lives closer to normal"", but he said ""there is no point shutting down a city in one part of the country to contain an outbreak in another part of the country"".  Hundreds have defied a ban on large gatherings in Thailand to demand the resignation of the government and the dissolution of parliament. Scuffles broke out between mainly young protesters and police in the capital Bangkok. The Thai economy - which relies heavily on tourism and exports - is facing an unprecedented hit due to the pandemic. This is adding to what was already rising anger towards the government of former army chief Prayut Chan-O-Cha over a wide-range of issues. These include the harassment and disappearance of government critics, as well as amendments to the constitution that critics say
almost guaranteed victory for the ruling party in elections
last year. ""The government doesn't care about us, so either we come out or we lose anyway,"" an 18-year-old student called Sang told the AFP news agency. This video can not be played Zane Powles walks around five miles a day delivering up to 80 school lunches to pupils. UK teacher Zane Powles said he has been ""inundated with support"" after he hand-delivered his final free school meal yesterday. The assistant headteacher at Western Primary School in Grimsby has carried 7,500 meals to students since lockdown began, walking a total of 550 miles with a heavily laden rucksack. âWalking around the estate and around neighbours, people have been in their hordes coming out and clapping, people I donât know, who appreciate and see the effort thatâs being done for our kids,"" he said. The 48-year-old said the work of footballer Marcus Rashford in campaigning for free school meal vouchers during the summer holidays meant that he could now take a break. But his idea of rest and relaxation is a 1,500-mile (2,400-km) cycling challenge around the British Isles. The trip will raise money for special needs charity FLAG as well as Meals & More, which gives children meals during school holidays. Mr Powles said: âOur motto is âthe school that caresâ, and hopefully weâve showed the children that we care for them in school, and we care for them when theyâre not in school.â The refugee camp of Moria on the island of Lesbos will be on lockdown until 2 August Greece has announced a further extension of a lockdown to its packed migrant camps as infections in the country increase. The lockdown on camps began on 21 March and has been pushed back until 2 August ""for the prevention of the dispersion of the coronavirus cases"", the Migration ministry said. There have been no reported deaths from Covid-19 in Greek migrant camps, which are currently home to more than 31,000 asylum seekers on five islands. Meanwhile, across Greece, supermarket employees and customers must wear face masks as of Saturday. Fines of â¬150 (Â£135) will be issued to those ignoring the rule. With 194 coronavirus deaths, Greece has managed to avoid having any major outbreaks and reopened all its airports to international travel on 1 July, with UK flights resuming last Wednesday. However, the average of new cases has risen to 35 per day, up from 25 earlier in the month. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Urumqi is being subjected to what are now typical Chinese lockdown measures for outbreaks A ""wartime state"" has been declared in Urumqi, the capital of China's western Xinjiang region, after a spike in cases of coronavirus. Officials on Saturday said 17 new cases had been recorded and strict measures on movement had been imposed. Although the figure appears low, China has recorded very few significant outbreaks since Covid-19 emerged in the city of Wuhan late last year. China is now not in the top 20 in terms of either infections or deaths. Wuhan - city of silence What did China do about early outbreak? Did China test a whole city in 10 days? It has recorded just over 85,000 infections and 4,600 fatalities,according to Johns Hopkins university research,external. The capital of the Xinjiang Autonomous Region has a population of about 3.5 million. The latest infections began to be detected on Wednesday, the first in the region for months, prompting the cancellation of almost all flights in and out of the city. Subway services were also suspended. On Saturday, officials said the total of cases was 17. One official told a state briefing: ""The whole city has entered a 'wartime state', and will suspend all kinds of group activities."" The latest lockdown measures include: Mass screening in buildings where new cases have been detected, later expanding to the whole of Urumqi Visits to other households are restricted, as are large gatherings Residents urged not to leave the city unless absolutely necessary and must be tested if they do Rui Baoling, the director of the disease control and prevention, said the main cluster had been detected in the Tianshan district of Urumqi but although the ""epidemic has developed rapidly"", she added that the ""situation is generally controllable"". Xinjiang has this week reported another 23 cases listed as ""asymptomatic"", with 269 people under ""medical observation"". The vast majority of coronavirus deaths and most of the infections in China occurred in Wuhan at the start of the year. Since then, the only large-scale cluster was reported in June in Beijing, where more than 330 people were infected before the outbreak was contained. However, some have questioned China's reporting of numbers on the outbreak. This video can not be played Paul Adams asks whether China is being bolder in the wake of the pandemic China has certainly taken tough measures to prevent any outbreak expanding, imposing strict controls where necessary, including shutting transport and introducing mass testing. For Friday, only 22 new cases were reported for the whole of mainland China, and that includes 16 of Urumqi's cases. To put this in perspective, Florida on Saturday registered a rise of more than 10,000 cases. Xinjiang is home to the mainly Muslim Uighur people and other Turkic minorities and is subject to intense state control. The BBC's China correspondent Stephen McDonell says there is the added sensitivity of controversial detention camps where hundreds of thousands of mostly ethnic Uighurs have been interned as part of a mass ""de-radicalisation"" programme. He says if the coronavirus got into one of those camps the same way it has in prisons, the possibility of widespread infection would be considerable. Xinjiang is one of a number of issues that have contributed to worsening US-China relations. China's hidden camps Last week, the Trump administration announced sanctions against Chinese politicians who it says are responsible for human rights violations against Muslim minorities in Xinjiang. China rejects the accusations. On Thursday, foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying invited US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to visit Xinjiang to see for himself that there were no such violations.

"In the first 17 weeks of the year 342 deaths were registered in Ceredigion - 22% more than the five-year average Coronavirus antibody tests should be used to establish if the virus was in Ceredigion earlier than thought, its council leader has declared. Deaths at the start of 2020 were 22% higher than the five-year average, figures obtained byNewyddion S4Cshow. Ellen ap Gwynn said she was ""almost certain"" she was infected with the virus after falling ill in January. The health board said it was looking into the data but had not yet identified ""anything unusual"". The local authority chief's callsfollow those of MP Ben Lake. The figures shows that in the first 17 weeks of this year, 342 deaths were registered. Deaths in January, February and March this year were higher than they have been in those months for at least a decade. Tourism 'balancing act' for Ceredigion Ceredigion 'safe zone' plan for town centres How did one county in Wales escape the worst of it? ""I personally suspect Covid may have reached Ceredigion earlier, as I fell ill in January with the exact symptoms associated with the virus,"" Ms ap Gwynn said. ""I would like to see the antibody tests being made available to more people."" The tests can confirm whether a person had previously been infected. According to the Office for National Statistics, seven people died with Covid-19 in Ceredigion She said it would be ""interesting"" to know how many had been infected to better trace the virus' spread. Marilyn Jones' mother-in-law, Nel Phillips, died on 8 January. The cause was a chest infection. Ms Jones said Ms Phillips was ""breathless and coughing"". ""It was awful seeing her struggling to breathe. And then she died in my arms. It was heartbreaking,"" she said. In February Ms Jones also fell ill. ""I was short of breath, was in terrible pain, had a high temperature,"" she said. She also suspects Covid-19 was in Ceredigion before lockdown.Â ""And I was bedridden for three days. I wouldn't be at all surprised to discover it was Covid. It was so different to a normal bug."" Hywel Dda University Health Board's medical director and deputy chief executive, Phil Kloer, said: ""We are looking into the detail behind the data and so far have not identified anything unusual, and we will work with Public Health Wales experts to analyse the data further."" ""The mortality data does vary from month to month and year to year, and the variation can be larger when using single county data,"" he said. Ceredigion has the lowest number of confirmed Covid-19 deaths in Wales. Council leader Ellen ap Gwynn believes she was infected with the illness in January According to the Office for National Statistics seven people have died in the county with the virus.Â The Welsh Government said antibody tests were currently given to ""defined groups"" - school staff, health and care workers and care home residents.

"Stefano Rossi, owner of Stefano's Fish and Chips in Edinburgh's Morningside, said his earnings were being ""whittled away to nothing"" Some business owners in Scotland are calling on their customers to pay with cash - saying the hidden costs from card payments are ""crippling"" them. The surge in electronic payments due to coronavirus guidance has left small businesses with hundreds of pounds of extra charges each month. Restaurateurs also said charges for increased takeaway deliveries were running into thousands of pounds. And some publicans said they could not afford table-ordering app fees. Stefano Rossi, owner of Stefano's Fish and Chips in Edinburgh's Morningside, said his earnings were being ""whittled away to nothing"". He said: ""Before the lockdown, I used to pay about Â£40 a month on card machine charges but now I've been paying Â£400 a month. ""I really need customers to return to paying with money now as all the charges are crippling my business. ""Some customers are seeing the sign I have put up and asking me if I'm trying to tax dodge, and I'm having to explain to them that could not be further from the truth. ""I declare everything and the reason for my sign is I just want to stop all these charges."" He added he was paying Â£550 a month extra on Just Eat charges since the lockdown began. ""People just don't realise that when they pay Â£10 for a takeaway order we only receive Â£8.10 and that is if we use our own driver,"" he said. ""Just Eat charges 14% on every order plus a 50p service charge and it's 35% if you use their driver. ""The delivery order costs are just too much now and I would urge customers to please start coming back to the shop and to use money."" Nadeem Amgid, owner of Yayas Grillhouse in Edinburgh's Colinton Mains, said there were a catalogue of charges involved with paying electronically. He said: ""People don't realise it costs us more if they pay electronically and even more if they pay over the phone. Takeaway owner Nadeem Amgid said he wanted his customers to be aware of all the hidden costs involved in cashless transactions ""The charges even vary depending on which card customers use. ""I've seen a huge difference in my card charge bill since the lockdown and am now paying Â£500 more on charges a month. ""Then there are the third party delivery charges which you were almost forced to join when the lockdown started as that was the way people were ordering food. ""Before the lockdown, I was spending about Â£600 a month on Just Eat and Uber Eat charges. But since the lockdown, I'm spending Â£3,480 a month."" He added: ""People think we want money over card payments for tax reasons but it's not that. It's because the electronic payment charges have become a real burden."" Antonio Baiano, owner of the Napole Pizzeria restaurant in Edinburgh's Corstorphine, said he was only surviving because everyone in his family had been helping. Restaurateur Antonio Baiano said he was struggling with his new delivery costs He said: ""I wish people would start using money again because it is costing me so much currently. ""I didn't do delivery before the lockdown but now I've had to join Just Eat and Uber Eat. ""The more money I make the more they make and the more you work the less profit is for you. I've been working 12 hour days during the lockdown but seen less profit because I have to pay so many charges. ""I've been giving Â£2,800 per month to Just Eat and Uber Eat. ""The costs are a lot but the customers don't know about it."" Zaheer Aslam, of the business podcast Chattin with Z, said: ""Small business owners have been telling me they are concerned that, between the fees they are now paying for the increased card machine use and the costs for using third party companies, it is not sustainable. ""They are saying to me they want customers now to return to spending money on-site so they don't have to pay the high commission costs to third party companies. ""With more card payments and less cash they are saying the increased overhead costs are too much and they say their businesses as a result are suffering massively."" Tom Ponton, owner of Oz Bar in Edinburgh's Grassmarket, said: ""We looked at the table order apps but they were just too expensive as they have a monthly charge, a charge for every transaction and a charge to use their cash machine."" A Just Eat spokeswoman said: ""Just Eat is only successful if our restaurant partners are successful and we believe our commission rates are aligned with the value we provide to our partners. ""Through our 30 day Covid-19 emergency support package, we gave over Â£11m worth of support to the many thousands of independent restaurants we work with across the UK.""

"This video can not be played PM announces powers to tackle local outbreaks Coronavirus restrictions will ease further in England under plans for a ""significant return to normality"" by Christmas, Boris Johnson has announced. Under the new guidelines, people may use public transport for journeys immediately, while advice for employers will change from 1 August. Companies will have more discretion to bring staff back to workplaces if it is safe to do so, the PM explained. Mr Johnson added he was ""hoping for the best and planning for the worst"". At a news conference at Downing Street, the prime minister saidthe plan,external""remains conditional"" on continued progress in controlling the virus and preventing a second wave of infections that could overwhelm the NHS. ""It is my strong and sincere hope that we will be able to review the outstanding restrictions and allow a more significant return to normality from November at the earliest - possibly in time for Christmas,"" he said. Devolved administrations in Scotland,Walesand Northern Ireland have the power to set their own timings for the easing of restrictions. Councils to get coronavirus shutdown powers Reality Check: PM's statement fact-checked In the announcement, Mr Johnson said the government was making it clear to people in England they may use public transport now. From 1 August, he said: ""Instead of government telling people to work from home, we are going to give employers more discretion, and ask them to make decisions about how their staff can work safely."" He explained that could mean ""continuing to work from home, which is one way of working safely and which has worked for many employers and employees"". However, the Welsh government said it would carry on advising people to work from home. This video can not be played Labour's Starmer on lifting coronavirus lockdown measures Responding to Mr Johnson's announcement, First Minister Mark Drakeford said: ""I positively don't want people to be returning to offices in the way that we did before coronavirus happened."" Will I have to return to the office if I don't want to? What will close during the next lockdowns?,external What's the risk on transport? The government's current social distancing guidance requires peopleto stay at least 1m apart with certain precautions. On Friday, a further 114 coronavirus deathswere announced,external, taking the total number of people who have died with the virus in the UK to 45,233. It comes as Public Health England saidit was pausing the publication of the daily death figure,externalwhile officials investigate claims thatthe numbers may have been distorted. Leicester has faced further restrictions which will begin to be lifted on 24 July On Thursday, the government's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance,told MPs there was ""absolutely no reason""to change the government's current guidance on working from home. The government has advised people to ""work from home if you can"" since March, and Sir Patrick said home working was still a ""perfectly good option"" for many. Asked about those comments at the news conference, Mr Johnson said he ""totally agrees"" with Sir Patrick and that it was not for the government to tell employers where their workforce should be. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he will look at the details of the government's plan to get people back to work but stressed ""this can't be done on a wing and a prayer and requires a credible plan and national leadership"". Business groups warnedany mass return to work immediately was unlikely. Smaller companies in particular would need more support to get workers back, Mike Cherry from the Federation of Small Businesses said. ""Small firms are being tasked with consulting employees and putting the right measures in place to ensure a safe return to work,"" he said. ""After weeks of little or no income, they will need help - both funding and advice - to make that happen."" Edwin Morgan, director of policy at the Institute of Directors, said childcare and concerns about using public transport were still issues for many employees. Trade union body the TUC accused ministers of ""passing the buck on this big decision to employers"" and said more investment in public transport would be needed to make commuting safer. From25 Julyindoor gyms, pools and other sports facilities can reopen On1 Augustthe government will update its advice on going to work, asking employers to make decisions about how and where their staff can work safely From the same date, most remaining leisure settings, including bowling, skating rinks, casinos and all close contact services, such as beauticians, will be allowed to reopen Live indoor theatre and concerts will be able to resume with socially distanced audiences Wedding receptions for up to 30 people will also be allowed from next month FromSeptember, schools, nurseries and colleges will be open for all children and young people on a full-time basis, while universities are also working to reopen as fully as possible FromOctober, the government intends to allow audiences to return to stadiums, while conferences and other business events can recommence, subject to the outcome of pilots The prime minister reiterated previously announced plans to pausethe shielding programmefor vulnerable people in England at the end of July. Butdisability groups expressed their concernthat this will come as employers are asked to consider bringing staff back to workplaces. James Taylor, from charity Scope, said the PM's announcement would ""ring alarm bells"" for disabled people who were ""extremely anxious"" about the change. Also from 1 August, Mr Johnson said most remaining leisure settings, such as bowling alleys, skating rinks and casinos, and close-contact services, such as beauticians, could resume. This video can not be played How theatre can reopen during the pandemic Indoor performanceswith socially-distanced audiences in theatres, music and performance venues will also be allowed from next month. However, soft play areas and nightclubs will remain closed beyond that date, although they ""will be kept under review"". From October, he said fanscould be able to return to sport stadiumsif pilot events go well. The upcoming World Snooker Championships in Sheffield, the Glorious Goodwood horse racing festival and two men's county cricket friendly matches are set to be among the trial sporting fixtures. Winter is the big concern. The problem is, we don't know how well coronavirus will spread as the nights draw in. The pandemic really kicked off in our spring so we don't know what a winter with Covid-19 will look like. There is evidence the virus survives longer in cooler temperatures - and similar infections, including flu, do get a winter boost. So how the virus behaves, and the effectiveness of NHS Test and Trace, will dictate how many of these restrictions can actually be lifted. Sage documents,external, released today, raise serious doubts about how far we can go. They say it is not possible to return to normality without levels of contact tracing and other coronavirus protections that would be ""difficult to achieve"". They advise the government should already be planning how measures should be reintroduced. The PM indicated that social distancing measures could be relaxed further for loved ones. He said: ""Throughout this period, we will look to allow more close contact between friends and family, where we can."" Mr Johnsonalso confirmed an additional Â£3bn in funding for the NHSto help it prepare for a potential second wave of infections and to cope with its usual winter pressures. An expansion in testing capacity to a target of 500,000 tests a day by the end of October would help identify positive coronavirus cases among people with symptoms of seasonal illnesses, he added. It comes days after scientists saidthe UK could see about 120,000 new coronavirus deathsin a second wave of infections this winter if no mitigations were put in place. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? YOUR QUESTIONS:Our experts have answers LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters In addition to the further easing of lockdown restrictions in England, Mr Johnson unveiled new powers for local authorities to manage outbreaks of the virus in their areas. He said local authorities would have the power to close premises, close off public outdoors spaces and cancel events. Ministers would also receive clearer guidance on where they can intervene to ""close whole sectors or types of premises in an area"" and advise people in specific postcodes to stay at home. ""It has to be right that we take local action in response to local outbreaks - there is no point shutting down a city in one part of the country to contain an outbreak in another part of the country,"" Mr Johnson said.

"People wearing face masks as they shop at an open fruit and vegetable market in Leicester Councils in England have been given new powers to close shops, cancel events and shut outdoor public spaces to manage local outbreaks of coronavirus. The PM said the move would enable councils to respond more quickly to outbreaks ""where speed is paramount"". The Local Government Association said it hoped it would prevent the need for stricter local lockdown measures. Meanwhile, a government scientific adviser has warned a return to pre-lockdown life remains ""a long way off"". A further 40 coronavirus deathshave been announced,external, taking the total number of people who have died after testing positive for coronavirus in the UK to 45,273.

This video can not be played PM announces powers to tackle local outbreaks James Jamieson, chairman of the LGA, which represents council leaders in England, welcomed the announcement, saying the extra powers will hopefully lessen the need for stricter measures being introduced locally. ""Councils know their local communities best and know how to address each unique outbreak,"" Mr Jamieson said. He added that the use of enforcement powers ""should be an option of last resort"" and called for more ""granular-level data"" to be made available to councils to allow them to be ""better able to act in real time to increases in infection rates"". Liverpool City Region mayor Steve Rotheram said more detailed data, such as the daily number of people reporting symptoms, would enable councils to target messaging to certain groups, for example younger people in a particular area. ""The messaging, therefore, might be that we use some of our footballers to get the message over not to go out or to wear face masks or coverings,"" he said. ""It really is about making certain that we can get the correct message to the right people at the right time."" Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told the BBC the government would provide daily updates to local areas. He said there had been ""issues"" with data sharing because of the General Data Protection Regulation rules. ""We've been working through all of that to put these local agreements in place and that will help dramatically,"" the transport secretary told Radio 4's Today programme. Government 'playing games' with Leicester lockdown 'Lockdown confusion wrecked our holiday' Lockdown 'should be lifted in 90% of Leicester' The new powers for councils came as theprime minister set out a ""roadmap"" for a return to ""normality"" by Christmasas part of an easing of the lockdown in England. Mr Johnson said it was his ""sincere hope"" the remaining restrictions could be reviewed in November, at the earliest, and possibly dropped by Christmas.

""If what you mean by normality is what we used to do until February and the middle of March this year - go to work normally, travel on the buses and trains, go on holiday without restrictions, meet friends, shake hands, hug each other and so on - that's a long way off, unfortunately,"" he told the Today programme. ""We won't be able to do that until we are immune to the virus, which means until we have a vaccine that is proven safe and effective. ""If we return to those sort of normal behaviours, the virus will come back very fast."" Also on Friday, the government dropped its advice to avoid public transport in England. Employers were also told it would be up to them to discuss with workers whether it was safe for them to return to workspaces from 1 August. Mr Shapps told BBC Breakfast the use of public transport was ""way down"" and there was spare capacity for people to return, even with social distancing. ""We're seeing in many cases quite empty, for example trains, particularly during the day, and we're saying actually there is more capacity there. You can now return - anybody, not just key workers, can now use public transport."" However, he advised people to continue to walk or cycle to work if they could.

"Urumqi is being subjected to what are now typical Chinese lockdown measures for outbreaks A ""wartime state"" has been declared in Urumqi, the capital of China's western Xinjiang region, after a spike in cases of coronavirus. Officials on Saturday said 17 new cases had been recorded and strict measures on movement had been imposed. Although the figure appears low, China has recorded very few significant outbreaks since Covid-19 emerged in the city of Wuhan late last year. China is now not in the top 20 in terms of either infections or deaths. Wuhan - city of silence What did China do about early outbreak? Did China test a whole city in 10 days? It has recorded just over 85,000 infections and 4,600 fatalities,according to Johns Hopkins university research,external. The capital of the Xinjiang Autonomous Region has a population of about 3.5 million. The latest infections began to be detected on Wednesday, the first in the region for months, prompting the cancellation of almost all flights in and out of the city. Subway services were also suspended. On Saturday, officials said the total of cases was 17. One official told a state briefing: ""The whole city has entered a 'wartime state', and will suspend all kinds of group activities."" The latest lockdown measures include: Mass screening in buildings where new cases have been detected, later expanding to the whole of Urumqi Visits to other households are restricted, as are large gatherings Residents urged not to leave the city unless absolutely necessary and must be tested if they do Rui Baoling, the director of the disease control and prevention, said the main cluster had been detected in the Tianshan district of Urumqi but although the ""epidemic has developed rapidly"", she added that the ""situation is generally controllable"". Xinjiang has this week reported another 23 cases listed as ""asymptomatic"", with 269 people under ""medical observation"". The vast majority of coronavirus deaths and most of the infections in China occurred in Wuhan at the start of the year. Since then, the only large-scale cluster was reported in June in Beijing, where more than 330 people were infected before the outbreak was contained. However, some have questioned China's reporting of numbers on the outbreak. This video can not be played Paul Adams asks whether China is being bolder in the wake of the pandemic China has certainly taken tough measures to prevent any outbreak expanding, imposing strict controls where necessary, including shutting transport and introducing mass testing. For Friday, only 22 new cases were reported for the whole of mainland China, and that includes 16 of Urumqi's cases. To put this in perspective, Florida on Saturday registered a rise of more than 10,000 cases. Xinjiang is home to the mainly Muslim Uighur people and other Turkic minorities and is subject to intense state control. The BBC's China correspondent Stephen McDonell says there is the added sensitivity of controversial detention camps where hundreds of thousands of mostly ethnic Uighurs have been interned as part of a mass ""de-radicalisation"" programme. He says if the coronavirus got into one of those camps the same way it has in prisons, the possibility of widespread infection would be considerable. Xinjiang is one of a number of issues that have contributed to worsening US-China relations. China's hidden camps Last week, the Trump administration announced sanctions against Chinese politicians who it says are responsible for human rights violations against Muslim minorities in Xinjiang. China rejects the accusations. On Thursday, foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying invited US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to visit Xinjiang to see for himself that there were no such violations.

"In the first 17 weeks of the year 342 deaths were registered in Ceredigion - 22% more than the five-year average Coronavirus antibody tests should be used to establish if the virus was in Ceredigion earlier than thought, its council leader has declared. Deaths at the start of 2020 were 22% higher than the five-year average, figures obtained byNewyddion S4Cshow. Ellen ap Gwynn said she was ""almost certain"" she was infected with the virus after falling ill in January. The health board said it was looking into the data but had not yet identified ""anything unusual"". The local authority chief's callsfollow those of MP Ben Lake. The figures shows that in the first 17 weeks of this year, 342 deaths were registered. Deaths in January, February and March this year were higher than they have been in those months for at least a decade. Tourism 'balancing act' for Ceredigion Ceredigion 'safe zone' plan for town centres How did one county in Wales escape the worst of it? ""I personally suspect Covid may have reached Ceredigion earlier, as I fell ill in January with the exact symptoms associated with the virus,"" Ms ap Gwynn said. ""I would like to see the antibody tests being made available to more people."" The tests can confirm whether a person had previously been infected. According to the Office for National Statistics, seven people died with Covid-19 in Ceredigion She said it would be ""interesting"" to know how many had been infected to better trace the virus' spread. Marilyn Jones' mother-in-law, Nel Phillips, died on 8 January. The cause was a chest infection. Ms Jones said Ms Phillips was ""breathless and coughing"". ""It was awful seeing her struggling to breathe. And then she died in my arms. It was heartbreaking,"" she said. In February Ms Jones also fell ill. ""I was short of breath, was in terrible pain, had a high temperature,"" she said. She also suspects Covid-19 was in Ceredigion before lockdown.Â ""And I was bedridden for three days. I wouldn't be at all surprised to discover it was Covid. It was so different to a normal bug."" Hywel Dda University Health Board's medical director and deputy chief executive, Phil Kloer, said: ""We are looking into the detail behind the data and so far have not identified anything unusual, and we will work with Public Health Wales experts to analyse the data further."" ""The mortality data does vary from month to month and year to year, and the variation can be larger when using single county data,"" he said. Ceredigion has the lowest number of confirmed Covid-19 deaths in Wales. Council leader Ellen ap Gwynn believes she was infected with the illness in January According to the Office for National Statistics seven people have died in the county with the virus.Â The Welsh Government said antibody tests were currently given to ""defined groups"" - school staff, health and care workers and care home residents.

"Resorts are now welcoming back British tourists More than 100 holiday companies have been told to speed up their refunds policy for coronavirus cancellations. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has received more than 17,500 complaints from people whose holidays have been hit by the virus. In an open letter from the CMA, companies have been reminded of the 14-day refund rule for cancellations. Travel firms say this has been an unprecedented crisis that put many of them on the brink of collapse. By law, if a package holiday is cancelled by the provider, then a refund should be provided for the whole holiday within 14 days. Many thousands of getaways were cancelled during lockdown, when the Foreign Office advised against all but essential travel outside of the UK. The CMA said its investigations found that some businesses may not have been giving these legally-required refunds. Other problems included: Holidaymakers only being offered a voucher for future travel, rather than a full refund Customers losing their deposits or being charged cancellation fees Companies misleading customers about their rights People finding it difficult to contact travel companies or to claim refunds In the letter, CMA director Cecilia Parker Aranha said the regulator recognised the ""extraordinary pressures"" faced by the sector. ""Although we were sympathetic to the challenges faced in the early days of the pandemic, it is nonetheless important that businesses comply with consumer law,"" she added. A spokeswoman for Abta, which represents the package holiday sector, said the pressures were continuing and that many companies, with loyal customers, had mutually agreed to a rebooked holiday rather than a refund. She said Abta had conducted its own investigations of members when customers had been misled. However, she added that package holiday companies were themselves facing delays from airlines in refunding them the flight element of any holiday. Coronavrus: What are my holiday travel and insurance rights? ""Many airlines, in particular, have been and continue to be very slow in passing refunds back to package holiday businesses, which means that those package holiday businesses are unable to refund their customers as promptly as they would wish,"" she said. ""It is essential, therefore, that effective regulatory action is taken against the airlines that are not currently refunding with seven days, as required under relevant consumer protection legislation."" Airlines are regulated by the Civil Aviation Authority which has been putting pressure on companies to comply. If you have a package holiday cancelled by the provider, then a refund should be provided for the whole holiday within 14 days If your flight is cancelled, you are entitled to a full refund to the original form of payment within seven days, although many airlines are struggling to meet that deadline. You can accept, or refuse, vouchers or a rebooking but a voucher will probably be invalid if the airline later goes bust If you decide against going on a future flight, which is not yet cancelled, then there is no right to a refund. Different airlines have different rules over what you can do, but many are waiving any charges for changing to a later flight or having a voucher instead.

"'Seek help' says Relate Cymru Relationship counsellors say they are bracing themselves for a ""post-lockdown reckoning"" similar to that usually seen after Christmas. Steph James, a counsellor in rural Wales, said couples ""thrown together in a stressful situation"" could trigger a ""surge"" in relationship breakdowns. A UK-wide poll of 2,000 people at the start of lockdown found 23% said it was placing pressure on their relationship. Relate Cymru urged people to seek help and not let problems ""fester"". The Relate survey in April found 29% of those questioned in Wales said lockdown was exerting extra pressure on their relationship. Around 20% of respondents in Wales said they were having doubts about their future together, compared to a figure of 12% for the UK as a whole. 'I moved in with my ex for the lockdown' Coronavirus: 'Be kinder to each other at home' The story of Wales' 100 days in lockdown Of those questioned across the UK, 42% said they were finding their partner irritating and 36% argued more. Ms James said: ""We may see a surge as we do after Christmas. Couples are thrown together in a stressful situation like this. ""Many can't leave, and there may come a lockdown reckoning where all the issues come to the fore. ""They are trying to get through, stiff upper lip. But as we get to some kind of normal, relationships will break down."" However, confidentiality issues have meant no counselling for those in abusive relationships, despite a ""huge increase"" during lockdown. Ms James described some couples opening up more on video conference sessions from the comfort of their living room, and one couple becoming closer despite the husband being in Dubai and wife in Wales. Lauren (not her real name) returned to her native Cardiff for a break before lockdown, she and her boyfriend of four years having just been furloughed from their jobs in England. But when the lockdown kicked in and the pandemic stretched on, the pair found themselves reflecting on the relationship. They eventually decided on an amicable split. The 24-year-old said: ""It just made me realise that it would be possible to have a different life without being in a relationship, and I don't think that I would have realised that had it not been for lockdown. ""I think it's definitely a step in the right direction for both of us, so it's sort of a weird blessing in disguise."" Lauren said the pandemic had certainly added strain to the relationship. ""It was highly stressful finding out that we weren't going to be getting an income and trying to do a joint Universal Credit application,"" she said. ""And so trying to sort all of that financial stuff out, while still contributing to the same rents and bills and having the trouble of not really being happy in the relationship, that was a massive pressure."" While the break-up has been tinged with sadness, Lauren felt it had ultimately been healthy for both parties. ""I don't think I realised how much my headspace was taken up by thinking about how my decisions might affect someone else,"" she said. Steph James said some farmers had struggled in lockdown Ms James, who is based near Cardigan and works across mid and west Wales, said farming couples in particular had struggled, with the demands of rural life taking their toll. ""It's already difficult running a farm and you add into that home schooling and getting the children to knuckle down. ""We've also had the beautiful weather and them wanting to go outside, with a lot of rural areas isolated, the five-mile rule and no access to childcare."" During lockdown, the charity Refuge has seencalls about domestic abuseincrease by 25% while Gwent Police chief constable Pam Kelly said there had been ""suppressed reporting"" and it was""inevitable"" more cases would come to lightafter lockdown. ""There has been a huge increase,"" Ms James said. ""Couples have been thrown together and abuse issues have manifested themselves. Home should be a safe area, but often it isn't."" However, counselling for couples in this situation often involves chatting to them individually to get to the bottom of the abuse issues. The lockdown means victims could find it harder to escape their abusers, say campaigners ""If one of them is unsafe, [chatting via video conference] with the other partner in the house, the more vulnerable person could be in danger,"" she added. ""We don't want to put anyone at greater risk, so have to prioritise safety."" Ms James noted that counselling via video apps and telephone had seen many benefits, including people more open to something often seen as ""taboo"" from the comfort of their homes. While there was a drop-off in counselling at the start of lockdown, more couples have now been engaging with it. Lockdown has not been bad for all though, as Ms James points to the couples that have ""pulled together"", had less distractions and been able to focus on their relationship, as well as realising all their problems were trivial in the face of the pandemic. There have also been the emergence of ""turbo relationships"" - those who were in the early stages when lockdown started and then moved in together, which could have been ""a recipe for disaster"". ""You're together 24-7, not going out with friends, so building very strong foundations,"" Ms James said. ""Time will tell, these are unprecedented times. Will they flounder on foundations, or stay strong? One core aspect will be spending time out of lockdown."" Home schooling and working from home have added to underlying tensions Relate Cymru's manager Val Tinkler urged people to seek help now and not let problems ""fester until things get irreparably bad"". ""We always see a peak in people seeking relationship support after Christmas, when spending unusually long together brings issues to the surface,"" she said. ""Add to that the current extended period of isolation, worries about job security, finances, how to juggle work with childcare and uncertainty about the future - and it's clear why we're expecting a relationship reckoning.""

"Christine Clement (far left) estimates she's paid around Â£275 in charges to BT over the last few years just to keep using her old email address as before Ofcom says it is concerned some customers are ""not being treated fairly"" over the amount they are being charged to keep old email addresses. This happens when customers continue to use an old email address from an internet service provider they have since left. Many people who subsequently switched have paid hundreds of pounds just to keep using their old address as before. Ofcom's investigation was prompted by a Money Boxreportearlier this year. Ofcom also found most people who use an address provided by their broadband company are former BT customers. BT says if customers want to switch provider but keep hold of their old BT email address they're charged Â£7.50 per month to be able to access and use their account like they used to, including accessing it using an app. That's what happened to Iain Stuart from Cardiff. He said that first BT started charging him Â£1.60 per month, ""then it went up to Â£5 and it's now Â£7.50."" ""My feeling on it is was [BT] basically had you over a barrel."" Like many other people Mr Stuart has registered his email address with dozens of websites including banks, building societies, utility companies, online shops and social media accounts - not to mention all his friends and family who use it. ""To change something I've been using for no end of different things... when you start looking at it, if you went through the whole lot of them, and I've looked at the logistics of changing my email address, it's not something I want to waste my time doing. ""The alternative is to pay Â£90 per year. I can afford to pay but I shouldn't have to pay and I don't want to pay."" BT says it offers a free service for people to access their old email address - but that has to be done by logging on via a web browser which doesn't allow people to get emails via apps on their mobile phones. That free, web browser-only service is also not something that appeals to Mr Stuart. ""I just want to be able to use my email account as I have done for years and years."" One in six UK adults say they're likely to be put off switching broadband provider out of fear of losing their email address or being charged to keep it, according to research by comparethemarket.com. It's this point which Ofcom is concerned about. Christine Clement says she's been with other broadband providers for years but is still paying BT for an email address she first started using around the year 2000. ""I fail to see what service I get for paying Â£7.50 per month. ""When [the charges] first came in Â£1.60 seemed reasonable but Â£7.50 per month is Â£90 per year and that does seem quite a large amount,"" she says.

""I must have at least 40-plus accounts I've registered my email with. That's quite a lot to change and that's without even notifying friends and family.

"Stefano Rossi, owner of Stefano's Fish and Chips in Edinburgh's Morningside, said his earnings were being ""whittled away to nothing"" Some business owners in Scotland are calling on their customers to pay with cash - saying the hidden costs from card payments are ""crippling"" them. The surge in electronic payments due to coronavirus guidance has left small businesses with hundreds of pounds of extra charges each month. Restaurateurs also said charges for increased takeaway deliveries were running into thousands of pounds. And some publicans said they could not afford table-ordering app fees. Stefano Rossi, owner of Stefano's Fish and Chips in Edinburgh's Morningside, said his earnings were being ""whittled away to nothing"". He said: ""Before the lockdown, I used to pay about Â£40 a month on card machine charges but now I've been paying Â£400 a month. ""I really need customers to return to paying with money now as all the charges are crippling my business. ""Some customers are seeing the sign I have put up and asking me if I'm trying to tax dodge, and I'm having to explain to them that could not be further from the truth. ""I declare everything and the reason for my sign is I just want to stop all these charges."" He added he was paying Â£550 a month extra on Just Eat charges since the lockdown began. ""People just don't realise that when they pay Â£10 for a takeaway order we only receive Â£8.10 and that is if we use our own driver,"" he said. ""Just Eat charges 14% on every order plus a 50p service charge and it's 35% if you use their driver. ""The delivery order costs are just too much now and I would urge customers to please start coming back to the shop and to use money."" Nadeem Amgid, owner of Yayas Grillhouse in Edinburgh's Colinton Mains, said there were a catalogue of charges involved with paying electronically. He said: ""People don't realise it costs us more if they pay electronically and even more if they pay over the phone. Takeaway owner Nadeem Amgid said he wanted his customers to be aware of all the hidden costs involved in cashless transactions ""The charges even vary depending on which card customers use. ""I've seen a huge difference in my card charge bill since the lockdown and am now paying Â£500 more on charges a month. ""Then there are the third party delivery charges which you were almost forced to join when the lockdown started as that was the way people were ordering food. ""Before the lockdown, I was spending about Â£600 a month on Just Eat and Uber Eat charges. But since the lockdown, I'm spending Â£3,480 a month."" He added: ""People think we want money over card payments for tax reasons but it's not that. It's because the electronic payment charges have become a real burden."" Antonio Baiano, owner of the Napole Pizzeria restaurant in Edinburgh's Corstorphine, said he was only surviving because everyone in his family had been helping. Restaurateur Antonio Baiano said he was struggling with his new delivery costs He said: ""I wish people would start using money again because it is costing me so much currently. ""I didn't do delivery before the lockdown but now I've had to join Just Eat and Uber Eat. ""The more money I make the more they make and the more you work the less profit is for you. I've been working 12 hour days during the lockdown but seen less profit because I have to pay so many charges. ""I've been giving Â£2,800 per month to Just Eat and Uber Eat. ""The costs are a lot but the customers don't know about it."" Zaheer Aslam, of the business podcast Chattin with Z, said: ""Small business owners have been telling me they are concerned that, between the fees they are now paying for the increased card machine use and the costs for using third party companies, it is not sustainable. ""They are saying to me they want customers now to return to spending money on-site so they don't have to pay the high commission costs to third party companies. ""With more card payments and less cash they are saying the increased overhead costs are too much and they say their businesses as a result are suffering massively."" Tom Ponton, owner of Oz Bar in Edinburgh's Grassmarket, said: ""We looked at the table order apps but they were just too expensive as they have a monthly charge, a charge for every transaction and a charge to use their cash machine."" A Just Eat spokeswoman said: ""Just Eat is only successful if our restaurant partners are successful and we believe our commission rates are aligned with the value we provide to our partners. ""Through our 30 day Covid-19 emergency support package, we gave over Â£11m worth of support to the many thousands of independent restaurants we work with across the UK.""

"Twitter has confirmed hackers made use of tools that were supposed to have only been available to its own staff to carry off Wednesday's hack attack. The breach saw the accounts of Barack Obama, Elon Musk, Kanye West and Bill Gates among other celebrities used to tweet a Bitcoin scam. Twitter also revealed,externalthe perpetrators had downloaded data from up to eight of the accounts involved. It declined to reveal their identities but said none of them were ""verified"". This means they did not have a blue tick to confirm their ownership, and thus were not among the most high-profile hacked accounts. However, the fact the attackers were able to make use of the Your Twitter Data download toolmeans they now potentially have access to,externalaffected users': private direct messages, including photos and videos contacts, which Twitter's app would have imported from their smartphone address books physical location history, logged at times they had used the service details about the accounts they had muted and blocked interest and demographic information Twitter had inferred about them via their use of its platform In a further development, the New York Times has suggested that the social network became exposed after the hackers gained access to credentials that had been shared on Twitter's internal Slack messaging channel - a service that some companies use as an alternative to email. The newspaper also suggests that at least two of those involved are from England. In total, Twitter said 130 accounts had been targeted, of which the hackers had managed to reset the passwords of 45, giving them control. It added that it believed those responsible may have attempted to sell some of the pilfered usernames. ""The attackers successfully manipulated a small number of employees and used their credentials to access Twitter's internal systems,"" it said in a statement. ""We are continuing our investigation of this incident, working with law enforcement, and determining longer-term actions we should take to improve the security of our systems."" It added: ""We're embarrassed, we're disappointed, and more than anything, we're sorry."" Twitter said the attackers had targeted certain Twitter employees through a ""social engineering scheme"". ""In this context, social engineering is the intentional manipulation of people into performing certain actions and divulging confidential information,"" it said. A small number of staff had been successfully manipulated, it said. Once inside Twitter's internal systems, the hackers were not able to see users' previous passwords but could access personal information including email addresses and phone numbers as these are visible to staff using internal support tools. Listen to Tech Tent: The big Twitter hack Twitter hack: What went wrong and why it matters What is Bitcoin? They may also have been able to view additional information, the company said. There has been speculation that this could include direct messages. The private messages of Kanye West, Kim Kardashian West or Elon Musk could be worth money on dark web forums. Selling the private messages of presidential hopeful Joe Biden or former mayor of New York Michael Bloomberg could also have political consequences. It is not clear why the hackers did not download all the data of these celebrity accounts but did so for others. Twitter is ""actively working on communicating directly"" with the affected users, its statement said. It is also continuing to restore access for other users still locked out of their accounts as a result of the firm's initial response to the hack. On 15 July, a number of Bitcoin-related accounts began tweeting what appeared to be a simple Bitcoin scam, promising to ""give back"" to the community by doubling any Bitcoin sent to their address. Then, the apparent scam spread to high-profile accounts such as Kim Kardashian West and Joe Biden, and those of corporations Apple and Uber. Twitter scrambled to contain the unprecedented attack, temporarily preventing all verified users - those with a blue tick on their accounts - from tweeting. However, US President Donald Trump, one of the most prominent Twitter users, was unaffected. There has been speculation for some time that President Trump has extra protections in placeafter his account was deactivated by an employee on their last day of work in 2017. The New York Times confirmed that was how Mr Trump's account escaped the attack,external, citing an anonymous White House official and a separate Twitter employee. Despite the fact that the scam was obvious to some, the attackers received hundreds of transfers, worth more than $100,000 (Â£80,000). Bitcoin is extremely hard to trace and the three separate crypto-currency wallets that the cyber-criminals used have already been emptied. The digital money is likely to be split into smaller amounts and run through so-called ""mixer"" or ""tumbler"" services to make it even harder to trace back to the attackers. This video can not be played Bitcoin explained: How do cryptocurrencies work? Clues about those responsible have surfaced through bragging on social media - including on Twitter itself. Earlier this week, researchers at cyber-crime intelligence firm Hudson Rock spotted an advert on a hacker forum claiming to be able to steal any Twitter account by changing the email address to which it is linked. The seller also posted a screenshot of the panel usually reserved for high-level Twitter employees. It appeared to allow full control of adding an email to an account or ""detaching"" existing ones. Hackers posted the view from the Twitter control panel This means that the attackers had access to the back end of Twitter at least 36-48 hours before the Bitcoin scams began appearing on Wednesday evening. The researchers have also linked at least one Twitter account to the hack, which has now been suspended.

"Dr Fauci: ""It's only reflecting negatively on them"" US infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci has described recent efforts by the Trump administration to discredit him as ""bizarre"" and ""nonsense"". ""Ultimately, it hurts the president to do that,"" Dr Fauci said in an interview with The Atlantic. ""It doesn't do anything but reflect poorly on them."" On Sunday, a White House official shared a list detailing past apparent erroneous comments by Dr Fauci. But on Wednesday Mr Trump insisted he had a ""good relationship"" with him. ""We're all in the same team including Dr Fauci,"" he said. ""We want to get rid of this mess that China sent us, so everybody's working on the same line and we're doing very well."" Living in Florida and Texas as virus cases surge Why we should all be wearing masks The White House statement attacking Dr Fauci criticised him for what it said was conflicting advice on face coverings and remarks on Covid-19's severity. Responding to the criticism,Dr Fauci told The Atlantic that targeting him was ""completely wrong"",external. ""I cannot figure out in my wildest dreams why they would want to do that,"" he said. ""I think they realise now that that was not a prudent thing to do, because it's only reflecting negatively on them,"" he added. Anthony Fauci isn't angry. He's just... disappointed. The top government expert on infectious diseases took the high road in his first public comments after White House officials, both on and off the record, questioned his professional judgement and handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Dr Fauci acknowledges that the advice and analysis he has provided has shifted over time, but he insists his recommendations have always been based on the latest science. Those views have sometimes led to clashes with the president, who has attempted to shift focus to rebuilding a US economy that has been devastated by the pandemic. Dr Fauci has said that the top priority must be controlling the spread of the virus and recent reopening steps have set those efforts back. Such blunt talk has helped make Dr Fauci a popular figure during the pandemic, and that alone may be behind some of the resentment that is simmering within the White House. The swipes at Dr Fauci, however, seem destined to be counter-productive. With a general election just a few months away the Trump campaign needs a consistent public message - and an administration attacking one of its own, then distancing itself from those attacks, may only promote a message of chaos and confusion. Dr Fauci was also criticised by Peter Navarro, Mr Trump's top trade adviser,in an opinion piece for USA Today,externalin which he said the disease expert had been ""wrong about everything I have interacted with him on"". However, the White Housedistanced itself from Mr Navarro's remarks,external, with communications chief Alyssa Farah tweeting that the article ""didn't go through normal White House clearance processes"" and was ""the opinion of Peter alone"". Asked about Mr Navarro's piece as he departed the White House for Atlanta, Mr Trump said he should not have written it. ""Well he made a statement representing himself. He shouldn't be doing that,"" he said. In his interview with The Atlantic, Dr Fauci said he was not thinking of resigning over the attacks on him. ""I think the problem is too important for me to get into those kinds of thoughts and discussions. I just want to do my job. I'm really good at it. I think I can contribute. And I'm going to keep doing it,"" he said. He has also told Reuters that he believes the US will successfully develop a vaccine against the coronavirus by the end of the year. It follows early stage results from a vaccine developed by the firm Moderna, which Dr Fauci said were promising because the vaccine appeared to offer the type of protection seen in a natural infection. Dr Fauci's comments come after reports that as of 15 July, US hospitals will have to report Covid-19 patient data to the federal health agency in Washington instead of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). The CDC, the US's top public health institute, has until now been responsible for handling data about the pandemic from its hospital network. Health experts have expressed concerns that data will be politicised, become less transparent and possibly affect the work of researchers and modellers. The US has reported more than 3.4 million cases of coronavirus, and more than 136,000 deaths nationwide, according to Johns Hopkins University.

"A waiter in Miami wears a mask during the dinner rush People in Florida and Texas - where new coronavirus infections are ballooning - have described their opinions about the pandemic and their leaders decisions to restart the economy before defeating the virus. I am worried about the situation in the entire world, not just my hometown of Pembroke Pines, Florida. This is a sad situation that we have all been affected by and the best thing we can do is hope for it to end soon. I knew that this was inevitable. I do not believe Florida opened their businesses too soon. At the end of the day some responsibility has to be placed in the hands of citizens. What's behind alarming new US outbreaks? Is the pandemic getting worse in the US? I do not quarantine right now. I decided to stay in Gainesville, where I go to college, and am surrounding myself with people who are at very low risk of developing bad symptoms. I try to wear a mask as often as I can. This video can not be played Why coronavirus cases are surging in Texas As someone who planned on moving to a large city after graduation this summer, the pandemic has affected my life a lot. Days that used to be packed with going to the gym, searching for jobs and having fun with friends have become quests of finding small activities to keep me productive. Right now, the goal of every citizen should be staying healthy and protecting those that are most vulnerable to the virus. I have been here for four years as I attend Florida Atlantic University. I feel just as nervous as I did In March when it all started. But I do think there was a period when everyone began to forget about the virus. I even thought things were getting better for awhile. I absolutely think businesses reopened too soon. For the most part I know I could be doing better with social distancing. I've been going to yoga classes and took a trip to a hotel in Miami for the weekend which was probably not my best decision. But we made sure to keep six feet apart and wear masks. Masks are worn to buy ice cream in Florida Living with the pandemic has been really hard. I'm graduating from university this semester and always thought I'd be diving straight into my career, but a lot of companies are not hiring right now. To be honest, I don't really know what I'm supposed to be doing. The Florida governor needs to make it easier for people here to get a test. It should not be this hard during a pandemic to find a test. It took days of being placed on hold or hung up on before I finally found a place that required me to stand in 99F (37C) heat for nearly two hours before I could get tested. I watched an elderly women practically collapse as she waited in direct sunlight with no seat or water. Thank you to everyone on the front line fighting this thing, but we need to do better. I'm mostly worried about the people who aren't taking it seriously here in Boca Raton and are preventing us from improving or moving forward from this. I don't think it was reopening businesses that caused an increase in cases. I think it was the people. This video can not be played Florida residents push back on new face mask mandate I think it's people's behaviour that caused the Florida outbreak, like crowding on beaches and in bars with no masks. I personally wear a mask when I leave my home. Most places and grocery stores require it. Professional drag performers wear face shields in Miami The pandemic has personally affected me by having my dream internship cancelled, my graduation ceremony cancelled, my senior year in college cancelled and many job opportunities cancelled. The governor should implement rules or do something that will make people follow them. It's very frustrating how wearing masks has become about political opinion, rather than a simple precaution. When we reopened, my friends all went to the Houston bars, and they have all tested positive now. If I wasn't in the healthcare industry, I'm sure I'd still be somewhat careful. I'm a Republican, but I don't think Trump should be enforcing rules if he isn't following them. I don't agree with how he acts. I think that if he led by example, more likely people would follow and wear masks. Like, even the people who were protesting Trump wore masks, it really isn't that hard. So, I think that the way he acts discredits his authority. But I think Governor Abbott and his team have done everything they can do. Some bar owners here in Austin are vocally going against what we need to do - criticising the data and suing the government for shutting them down. If we continue to do this, we are going to be shut down for the rest of the year. For me that's completely narcissistic. How certain bar owners are acting is ludicrous. The reopening should have been done less quickly. I think initially the decision by local and state government, who closed down everything quickly, was made out of fear instead of data. If it was scientific evidence that led to the closure back in March, I think that the data wasn't shared as well as it should have been. The New York governor gave daily talks where he would explain with data. That was more credible than what occurred here in Texas. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? UPLIFTING STORY: '' I got a life-changing opportunity in lockdown' MEETING FRIENDS:How can I do that safely? GLOBAL TAKE:Which country has the most generous bailout? THE LOST SIX WEEKS:Missed chances for US to contain outbreak The pandemic is horrible. So many people have died, but I don't think the is media is portraying it in the correct light, and are putting the president at fault for it. Personally, it's affecting me with school and stuff but don't know anyone with the virus. When Texas reopened I was hanging out with friends on a daily basis. Places up north are much worse. There is so much land here, and when you look at the numbers and the percentages, a lot of deaths are in nursing homes. Bar patrons in Texas We shouldn't be shutting down the economy I'm happy with the way the things reopened the way they did. I wash my hands to be more cautious and stuff, but if I need to go to the store I'm going to go. I've been to a couple of parties. I am aware I could get it at a party. I went to Austin, I thought if I'm getting it, it would for sure be then. But two weeks later I'm fine. I was around so many different people, and nothing happened. I have lived in Miami for the last 23 years where I lead the Florida International Bankers Association. I am as concerned now as I was when the pandemic first started. I still have most of my essentials delivered to my house and I wear a mask anytime I go out. I do not believe the issue is when businesses reopened, but rather how the guidelines are being respected. My staff and I have been working remotely from home for more than 100 days now. I no longer have the freedom to go to restaurants or movies and, more importantly, to travel. If I could speak to my governor, I would ask him to be more stringent in enforcing the recommended WHO and CDC guidelines regarding the use of masks and social distancing.

"This video can not be played Top US doctor explains US testing failure Dr Anthony Fauci has emerged as the face of America's fight against coronavirus. But he is also battling the dangerous spread of misinformation, sometimes from within his own government. Over his five decades as a medical researcher, Anthony Fauci has seen his effigy burnt, heard the cries of protesters calling him a ""murderer"", and had smoke bombs thrown outside his office window. But he has also been praised as the most famous doctor in America, and the man whose compassion and calm helped the US make otherwise impossible strides in confronting a public health crisis. As head of immunology at the National Institutes of Health during the 1980s HIV/Aids epidemic, Dr Fauci, 79, has seen conflict before. Now, as the US struggles to contain the pandemic six months after its first known case, the White House is targeting Dr Fauci by briefing reporters about his alleged mistakes. Born on Christmas Eve, 1940 to a family of immigrant Italian pharmacists in Brooklyn, Anthony was ""delivering prescriptions from the time I was old enough to ride a bike,"" he told the Holy Cross college alumni magazine in 2002. In 1966, he graduated first in his class at Cornell medical school, whose library he had helped build as an undergraduate working construction to earn money over the summers. The family pharmacy in Brooklyn run by Dr Fauci's father, known in the neighbourhood as 'Doc' Following a medical residency, he joined the NIH in 1968 as part of the US war effort, instead of being drafted to fight in Vietnam. ""Yellow Berets"", the researchers were called - a play on military division Green Berets. A turning point in his career came decades later, he said, when a report landed on his desk on June 5, 1981, describing the death of an otherwise healthy patient from a strange pneumonia normally seen in people with cancer. Another report soon followed describing 26 deaths, all gay men. ""I remember reading it very clearly,"" he later said. ""It was the first time in my medical career I actually got goose pimples. I no longer dismissed it as a curiosity. There was something very wrong here. This was really a new microbe of some sort, acting like a sexually transmitted disease."" As a clinician, Dr Fauci's work on the regulation of the human immune system was credited with helping to reveal how the HIV virus destroys the body's defences. He led clinical trials for zidovudine, the first antiretroviral drug to treat Aids. As the epidemic swept through the US in the 1980s, however, he became the target of activists angry at the Reagan administration's muted response and lack of access to novel drugs. Aids activists protesting the government's response to the epidemic in 1988 Protesters held signs outside government offices that said: ""Dr Fauci, you are killing us"" and he was denounced on television by activists. The playwright and gay rights advocate Larry Kramer even modelled the antagonist of a play after him. ""I remember looking out a window and people on the lawn of the NIH were throwing smoke bombs,"" Dr Fauci recalled in a 2011 interview. ""Police were ready to arrest them and I said, 'Don't. Bring them up to my office so I can talk with them'."" His compassion for Aids sufferers was lauded, and he was credited with convincing regulators to loosen restrictions on clinical trials for patients to test new drugs. The first confirmed case of HIV in America World-renowned HIV researcher Frank Plummer, 67, dies The New York Times called him ""the government's leading Aids celebrity"" - but noted that he still actually did all his research work himself, not like ""a lot of people you see quoted on TV [who have] assistants don white coats and do all that tedious work"". He was awarded the highest US civilian honour, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, in 2008. In 1984, he was appointed director of the NIH's Allergy and Infectious Diseases division, a title he still holds. The research division he leads has overseen studies on everything from Aids to Ebola to asthma. He has advised six presidents, helping to found George W Bush's US government Aids initiative in Africa and now, serving as explainer-in-chief to the public amid the Covid-19 outbreak of the Trump era. One case lays bare America's testing failure Coronavirus spreading in New York like 'a bullet train' What this crisis reveals about US - and its president For Americans, he has become a trusted presence behind the podium at White House Covid-19 briefings, where he has dispensed facts about the US response, explaining the science and sometimes correcting President Trump's pronouncements. A vaccine will take at least a year and a half, he has said, dampening Mr Trump's optimistic claim one would be ready very soon. The current US leader, who is known to dislike being challenged, has even begrudgingly given Dr Fauci a high compliment. The researcher, Mr Trump has said, is ""a major television star"". However, observers say his contradictions of the president's claims has laid bare the frictions of working with the White House. When Dr Fauci told CNN in an interview that the US ""could have saved lives"" if it had introduced measures to stop Covid-19, Mr Trump shared a tweet on firing him. Dr Fauci told Science magazine that when it comes to giving the public correct information, ""I'm trying my best. I cannot do the impossible"". ""I can't jump in front of the microphone and push him [President Trump] down. OK, he said it. Let's try and get it corrected for the next time."" But he will try and stay the course, he said, adding: ""To my knowledge, I haven't been fired."" In early May, Dr Fauci was blocked from testifying to a panel in the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives that was investigating the country's response to the pandemic. The White House said that as Dr Fauci is part of the government response to Covid-19, ""it is counter-productive to have the very individuals involved in those efforts appearing at congressional hearings"". He instead appeared in front of the Health, Education, Labour and Pensions Committee of the Republican-controlled Senate on 12 May.
