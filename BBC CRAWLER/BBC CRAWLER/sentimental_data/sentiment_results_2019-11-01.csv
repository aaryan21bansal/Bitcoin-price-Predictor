"Pham Thi Tra My and Nguyen Dinh Luong's families are concerned they may be among the victims All 39 people found dead in a refrigerated lorry in Essex were Vietnamese, police have said. The victims were found in a container on an industrial estate last week and were initially thought to be Chinese. But Essex Police said it was now in ""direct contact with a number of families in Vietnam and the UK"" and the Vietnamese government. A number of Vietnamese families have previously come forward fearing their loved ones are among the dead. Pham Thi Tra My, 26, sent her family a message on the night of 22 October - the day before the 39 people were found dead - saying her ""trip to a foreign land has failed"". Post-mortem examinations are being carried out on the 31 men and eight women to establish the cause of death. Assistant Chief Constable Tim Smith said: ""At this time, we believe the victims are Vietnamese nationals, and we are in contact with the Vietnamese Government."" He said police were not in a position to identify any of the victims. The bodies were discovered in the lorry trailer in the early hours of 23 October The Vietnamese Embassy in London said it was ""deeply saddened"" and sent its ""heartfelt condolences"" to the families of the victims. ""Specific identities of the victims still need to be identified and confirmed by the relevant authorities of Vietnam and UK,"" it said. It said it would ""closely co-ordinate with the relevant authorities of Vietnam and UK to support the families of the Vietnamese victims, if any, to bring their loved ones home"". Extradition proceedings launched over lorry deaths Why are Vietnamese people trying to reach the UK? Lorry death agony builds for Vietnamese families The father of 30-year-old Le Van Ha, who comes from an agricultural part of Vietnam, previously told the BBC he was convinced his son was among the dead. VietHome, a popular Vietnamese community forum in the UK, said it had passed on the pictures of almost 20 people who have been reported missing to detectives. Earlier, police in Vietnam's Ha Tinh province said they had charged two unnamed people with ""organising or brokering illegal immigration"". Le Minh Tuan, pictured here, fears his son Le Van Ha was among the dead in Essex The driver of the lorry, Maurice Robinson, from Northern Ireland, appeared in court on Monday charged with a string of offences, including 39 counts of manslaughter. Extradition proceedings have also begun against 22-year-old Eamonn Harrison, who was arrested in Dubin on a European Arrest Warrant. Police are also seeking two brothers from Northern Ireland, Ronan and Christopher Hughes, who are wanted on suspicion of manslaughter and people trafficking. This article was based on public announcements and appeals made by Essex Police at the relevant time. Christopher Hughes denies any involvement in these offences and Essex Police has since confirmed no further action will be taken against him. Since the publication of this article, his older brother, Ronan Hughes, 41, and Maurice Robinson, 26, both of County Armagh, have pleaded guilty to manslaughter. On 21 December 2020, the Crown Court, sitting at the Old Bailey, found Eamonn Harrison, 24 of Newry, County Down, and Gheorghe Nica, 43 of Basildon, Essex, guilty of manslaughter and Christopher Kennedy, 24, of County Armagh, and Valentin Calota 38, of Birmingham, guilty of conspiring to assist illegal immigration. Alexandru-Ovidiu Hanga, 28, of Tilbury, Essex, and Gazmir Nuzi, 43, of Tottenham, north London, admitted assisting unlawful immigration. All defendants were sentenced in January 2021.

"The Thomas Cook brand has been saved from obscurity after the Chinese owner of Club Med said it would buy the name for Â£11m. Fosun Tourism, which was seen as a potential saviour of Thomas Cook before it went bust, is also acquiring the Casa Cook and Cook's Club hotel brands. The hotels are aimed at individual travellers and young holidaymakers. Fosun's chairman Qian Jiannong, said the company ""always believed in the brand value of Thomas Cook"". He said: ""The acquisition of the Thomas Cook brand will enable the group to expand its tourism business building on the extensive brand awareness of Thomas Cook and the robust growth momentum of Chinese outbound tourism."" Fosun was the largest shareholder in Thomas Cook and had pledged to inject Â£450m into the company as part of a Â£900m rescue deal with bondholders and banks. However, the plan collapsed after banks demanded an extra Â£200m. That triggered Thomas Cook's liquidation, which put thousands of jobs in jeopardy and led to the biggest peacetime repatriation of UK citizens as holidaymakers were brought home. Last month, Sunderland-based Hays Travel stepped forwardto buy 555 Thomas Cook High Street shops. It later emerged that the shops had been sold to Hays for just Â£6m.

"Jason Farrell went on the run after repeatedly stabbing Sammy-Lee Lodwig A man has been jailed for life after stabbing his girlfriend to death at his home in a ""savage attack"". Sammy-Lee Lodwig, 22, was found with cuts to her throat and wounds to her chest at Jason Farrell's flat on Carlton Terrace in Swansea on 23 April. Farrell, 49, wasfound guilty of murder at Swansea Crown Court on Wednesdayand will serve a minimum of 26 years. Mr Justice Lewis told Farrell he had no doubt he ""intended"" to kill Ms Lodwig. Farrell admitted manslaughter but denied murder. He went on the run after repeatedly stabbing Ms Lodwig and leaving her to bleed to death on his bed. The pair had been taking heroin and crack cocaine that night and Farrell claimed hedid not remember attacking his girlfriend with a kitchen knife. Sammy-Lee Lodwig was killed in a ""savage attack"", the court heard After being arrested, Farrell wrote a ""chilling"" five-page confession, detailing how he stabbed Ms Lodwig in the face and throat. ""You gagged her. This was a savage attack,"" Mr Justice Lewis told the court. ""She must have been aware of and suffered from her injuries before she died."" ""You had tired of the relationship, you wanted to get rid of Sammy-Lee Lodwig and you did, by killing her."" Ms Lodwig was found by paramedics lying on a bed at Farrell's flat on 23 April after he had alerted neighbours. She was fully clothed, with cuts across her throat and forehead, and ""severe bleeding"" was found on the bedding. It was estimated she died 20 or 30 minutes before emergency services arrived. Michael Jones, prosecuting, said knotted and bloodstained dressing gown belts with traces of Ms Lodwig's saliva were found nearby, suggesting they may have been in or around her mouth. There were wounds on her chest deep enough to enter both lungs. Jason Farrell must serve at least 26 years in prison for murdering Sammy-Lee Lodwig Det Ch Insp Darren George described the attack as ""sustained, brutal and violent"". ""She was tied up by Farrell and was told by him that he was going to kill her, which he sadly did by stabbing her multiple times,"" he said. In a statement read outside court by a police officer, Ms Lodwig's family said: ""Sammy-Lee's life was cut way too short and she will be sorely missed by all her family and friends."" Farrell, who had also dated his victim's mother Sarah, was also convicted of causing grievous bodily harm with intent to Christopher Maher, and was sentenced to 14 years in prison to be served concurrently. The jury was told he had suspected Mr Maher of being Sarah Lodwig's new lover, before attacking him in the street.

"This video can not be played Beto O'Rourke: ""We do not have the means to pursue this campaign successfully"" US Democratic presidential hopeful Beto O'Rourke has announced he is ending his campaign. The former Texas congressman tweeted:""Our campaign has always been about seeing clearly, speaking honestly, and acting decisively.,external ""In that spirit: I am announcing that my service to the country will not be as a candidate or as the nominee."" Mr O'Rourke, 47, ran for president in March after losing his 2018 bid to oust Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz. In that Senate race, he did better than any Democrat had in Texas for decades, running a campaign that invigorated the party nationwide and drew comparisons with former President Barack Obama. His passionate delivery along with his good looks and background as a skateboarder and a punk rocker endeared him to liberals across the country. Who will take on Trump in 2020? But Mr O'Rourke struggled to carry that energy into a White House race crowded with more than 20 Democratic candidates. On Friday he said his campaign did not have ""the means to move forward successfully"". Speaking in Des Moines, Iowa, Mr O'Rourke thanked his supporters, many of whom were clearly disappointed. ""How proud I am to be with you,"" he said. This video can not be played Who is Beto O'Rourke? Mr O'Rourke vowed to support the Democratic nominee who will challenge President Donald Trump in the 2020 race for the White House. ""We're right in the middle of this fight,"" he said. Ina blog post announcing the end of his candidacy,external, he wrote: ""We confronted institutional, systemic racism and called out Donald Trump for his white supremacy and the violence that he's encouraged against communities that don't look like, pray like or love like the majority in this country."" Mr O'Rourke was highly critical of the president after a mass shooting in his hometown of El Paso, Texas, in August, describing the bloodshed as a ""consequence"" of Mr Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric. As the initial buzz over his campaign began to subside, Mr O'Rourke tried to reboot his candidacy. He began to focus on gun control, and vowed to remove assault-style weapons from private ownership, saying in one televised debate: ""Hell yes, we're going to take your AR-15s."" But he could not catch up with front-runners like former Vice-President Joe Biden, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders. Mr O'Rourke also found himself leap-frogged by another young, charismatic candidate - 37-year-old Pete Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Indiana. In the latest opinion poll by New York Times/Siena College on Friday, Mr O'Rourke drew the support of just 1% of voters in the crucial early-voting state of Iowa. Mr O'Rourke struggled to carry the energy of his insurgent Senate campaign into a White House bid Mr O'Rourke had been urged by donors to drop out of the presidential race and run against Texas Senator John Cornyn, who is up for re-election next year. But the O'Rourke camp reiterated in a statement on Friday night that he did not plan on standing for the Senate again. Mr O'Rourke is not the only once-promising Democratic candidate who is struggling - California Senator Kamala Harris this week scaled back her campaign, firing some staffers and shuttering offices in another key, early voting state, New Hampshire. In just about 12 months, Beto O'Rourke went from Democratic rock star to political rock bottom. During his 2018 Senate race, the former Texas congressman was fundraising like a top-tier presidential candidate. Beloved by Democrats across the country for his youthful energy, his passionate stump speeches became viral sensations. His obvious political skills in his home state did not translate on to the national stage, however, where a lack of campaign organisation and an inability to stand out on a crowded debate stage cost him dearly. Mr O'Rourke's relatively thin CV, which wasn't a concern for Democrats when he was facing conservative stalwart Ted Cruz in Texas, was also a liability in a match-up against senators and a former vice-president with extensive experience and in-depth policy knowledge. Some presidential hopefuls can run unsuccessful campaigns and end up with an elevated stature among party faithful - with more political prospects than when they began. Mr O'Rourke, whose campaign started high and trended only downward, was not so fortunate. He may have a second act in national politics, but his 2019 effort will be an experience he will have to overcome, not build on. Mr O'Rourke represented Texas' 16th congressional district for three terms before running unsuccessfully last year for the US Senate. He travelled to all of Texas' 254 counties during his Senate campaign, documenting his journey on social media, and broke Senate fundraising records by amassing more than $80m. He lives with his wife, Amy Hoover Sanders and three children in El Paso. He has an estimated net worth of nearly $9m (Â£6.7m). His first name is actually Robert, but he is known by his nickname Beto - a common contraction of Roberto, which he says he picked up as a child in El Paso. Following his November Senate defeat, Mr O'Rourke drew criticism for embarking on a road trip across the south-western US, during which he documented his travels in a blog and admitted he was stuck in a ""funk"". Even supporters questioned why Mr O'Rourke was on the road, leaving his wife at home to look after their children, while other Democratic contenders were assembling staff and funding. As he launched his campaign, he posed on the cover of Vanity Fair, telling the magazine about the White House race: ""Man, I'm just born to be in it."" He later said he regretted that move because it reinforced a ""perception of privilege."" After Mr O'Rourke dropped out on Friday, President Trump, a Republican, mocked him in a tweet.

"Women were being sold on apps including Instagram Kuwaiti authorities say they have officially summoned the owners of several social media accounts used to sell domestic workers as slaves. A BBC News Arabic investigation found online slave markets on apps provided and made available by Google and Apple, including Facebook-owned Instagram. Women were offered for sale as workers via hashtags such as ""maids for transfer"" or ""maids for sale"". Authorities say those involved have been ordered to take down their ads. They have also been compelled to sign a legal commitment, promising no longer to participate in this activity. This video can not be played BBC News Arabicâs undercover investigation exposes the buying and selling of domestic workers in the Gulf Instagram said it had also taken action since it was contacted by the BBC. It said it had removed further content across Facebook and Instagram, and would prevent the creation of new accounts designed to be used for the online slave market. Many of the most widely used accounts for buying and selling domestic workers appear to have stopped their activity. Read the full investigation:Slave markets found on Instagram and other apps Dr Mubarak Al-Azimi, head of Kuwait's Public Authority for Manpower, said it was investigating the woman featured in the BBC report who sold a 16-year-old girl from Guinea - whom we are calling ""Fatou"" - via an app. A police officer who also featured in the report is under investigation by the authorities. He said arrests and compensation for the victims were possible outcomes of the action. Kimberley Motley, an American international lawyer who has taken on Fatou's case, said: ""I believe the app developers should definitely provide compensation for Fatou. As well as possibly Apple and Google. ""On Apple Store they proclaim that they are responsible for everything that's put on their store. And so our question is, what does that responsibility mean?"" Ms Motley also called for criminal charges against those involved in trafficking Fatou to Kuwait. Google and Apple said they were working with app developers to prevent illegal activity on their platforms. On Thursday, BBC News Arabic published its undercover investigation which found domestic workers were being illegally bought and sold online in a booming black market.

Uber driver Tariq Houshieh confessed to murdering Rebecca Dykes, whose body was found by the roadside in December 2017. The 30-year-old had been strangled with a rope. Lebanese judges routinely call for death sentences in murder cases, but no executions have been carried out since 2004. The British embassy in Beirut saidMs Dykes was ""much loved and is deeply missed"",external, describing her as ""a talented, devoted humanitarian, whose skill, expertise and passion improved the lives of many people"".

"Adam Reechard Crespo has been charged in the murder of his girlfriend, Silvia Galva Florida police investigating the bizarre death of a woman during a domestic row have obtained audio from two Amazon Echo devices. Silvia Galva, 32, was impaled by a spear-tipped bed post in a struggle with her boyfriend, Adam Reechard Crespo, at their Hallandale Beach home. Mr Crespo, 43, has pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder. He says her death was a tragic accident. Police want to establish if the smart-speaker, Alexa, recorded the dispute. According to the police report, Mr Crespo said he was trying to pull Ms Galvo off their bed during an argument in the bedroom of their Hallandale Beach apartment in July when he heard a snap. Amazon asked to share Echo data in murder case Amazon sued over Alexa child recordings Chinese pupils 'work through night' to make Amazon Echos The police report says: ""[Mr Crespo] pulled the blade out of the victim's chest 'hoping it was not too bad.'"" But Ms Galva died with a 12in (30cm) double-sided blade through her chest following the altercation at the flat in a seaside city 20 miles (32km) north of Miami. A lawyer for Mr Crespo, Christopher O'Toole, told the BBC that Ms Galva's death was unintentional. Mr Crespo was sleeping when ""Silvia came into the bedroom, knocked the door down"". Mr Crespo has plead not guilty Ms Galva broke off one of the pointy bedposts and ""it ended up inside of her"", Mr O'Toole said. Hallandale Police did not return a request for comment. According to the police report, when Mr Crespo saw Ms Galva had been stabbed he called for a female friend who was in the apartment to call emergency services. ""He tried to save Silvia's life,"" Mr O'Toole said, ""this was the woman he loved."" A police warrant obtained by US media says ""audio recordings capturing the attack on victim Silvia Crespo... may be found on the server[s] maintained by or for Amazon.com"". Silvia Galva was impaled by a 12in double-sided blade Authorities said Amazon provided multiple recordings, but did not disclose their contents.

"Ross England has been suspended from his job with the Conservatives A former Tory candidate has said it is ""highly improbable"" key figures in the party did not know about Ross England's role in a collapsed rape trial. Luke Evetts, who is no longer a member, said damage to the party's reputation over the case was ""significant"". Mr England was selected to stand for the Conservatives in the next assembly election monthsafter he was accused of sabotaging the trial. Top party figuresdeny knowledge of his involvement before this week. Ross England, who also worked for the party, was suspended by the Conservatives from his employment and his candidacy this week after reports of the trial emerged in the press. In witness evidence in April 2018 Mr England made claims about the victim's sexual history, which she denies. The judge in the trial, Stephen Hopkins, said he had ""no doubt it was deliberate on [his] part, to sabotage this trial"". The defendant, James Hackett, was convicted following a retrial. Tory assembly candidate 'sabotaged' rape trial Rape trial 'sabotage' Tory candidate suspended ""In my experience of the management of the party, I find it highly improbable that the key triumvirate of Byron (Davies), Craig (Williams) and Alun (Cairns) didn't know about Ross's actions,"" Mr Evetts said. The former party activist, who stood for the Conservatives twice in Ceredigion and was chairman of the Ceredigion Conservative Association, added: ""If they didn't, they are incompetent. If they did know, they must face the music."" Lord Davies of Gower, chairman of the Welsh Conservatives, has said that neither he nor Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns knew about the way the trial collapsed. Luke Evetts stood for the Conservatives twice in Ceredigion and was chairman of the Ceredigion Conservative Association On BBC One's Wales Live programme on Wednesday, former Conservative MP Craig Williams, who has worked in the party's HQ in Cardiff, said he had not known about what had happened until it was reported in the media this week. Sources have told BBC Wales that Mr Cairns was informed about what happened at the trial before Ross England was chosen as a candidate in December last year. Leaflets in support of Mr Cairns, and bearing Mr England's name in small print, were sent to homes in the Vale of Glamorgan on Thursday. The Welsh Conservatives said: ""The leaflets were printed and produced prior to the details of the case coming into the public domain. Those leaflets have now been withdrawn."" The BBC has been told that Mr England was Mr Cairns' campaign manager until he was suspended this week. The victim in the trial was also a former member of staff at the constituency office of Mr Cairns. On Thursday, three days after BBC Wales reported the story, Lord Davies said he could ""categorically state"" that he and Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns were ""completely unaware of the details of the collapse of this trial until they became public this week"".

West Midlands Police said the flames seen on New Street shortly before 17:00 GMT were caused by an electrical fault below. West Midlands Fire Service said it had been liaising with power suppliers to deal with the problem. There were no reports of injuries, police said. Shoppers and workers who were about to make their way home shared images of the scene, where tram travel was disrupted. The fire service said it would tackle the blaze from within a service hatch, once the electrics were isolated by engineers. A Western Power Distribution spokesman said 103 properties had been affected by a power outage as a result of a fault with a junction box.

"Plastic sheeting was found in the stomach of the whale A sperm whale washed up on a beach died with plastic sheeting in its stomach, a post-mortem examination has found. The animal was first spotted at Hell's Mouth, near Abersoch, Gwynedd, on Tuesday evening and later died. It was the first sperm whale to be washed up in Wales since records began in 1913 - though a related pygmy sperm whale was found in June. The plastic was not the only piece of marine rubbish the 6.7-metre (22ft) long mammal had eaten. Rob Deaville, project manager for the Zoological Society of London's cetacean strandings investigation programme, said several pieces of marine debris were found in the animal's stomach. ""It is not possible to accurately assess whether the ingestion of debris was a result of the whale's presence in the abnormal habitat of shallow waters around the UK, or if other underlying issues may have played a role in their ingestion,"" he said. ""However, it may have had some impact on the animal's ability to digest any ingested prey. ""A large piece of blue plastic sheeting was found in the stomach and a relatively large mass of ropes."" Sperm whale washes up on Hell's Mouth beach, Gwynedd How to weigh a whale without a scale Whale 'swallows' sea lion: 'It was a once-in-a-lifetime event' There was also fishing line ""and other plastic fragments, seaweed and minor nematode parasites"". Tests are being conducted to shed further light on the unusual stranding The debris had not become impacted and blocked the stomach.Â Tests are now being conducted to shed light on this ""markedly unusual"" out-of-habitat stranding. The male calf was the second smallest sperm whale ever recorded in the UK. Because the whale was so small it is thought it may have come from a matriarchal pod rather than rather than a bachelor pod. The former are found in temperate and tropical waters south of the UK while the latter are found in colder waters north of the UK. Humpback whale spotted in the Thames.

"The government's MyTown campaign Facebook says it has taken down government advertising that was accused of targeting voters in marginal election constituencies. The social media firm said the ads ""were not correctly labelled"" and did not include the obligatory disclaimer. Each of the ads in the campaign,first reported by HuffPost UK,external, said the government was investing ""up to Â£25m"" in a named town. The government said it was always planned to end the promotion on Friday. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government maintains the advertisements were not ""pulled"" by Facebook. A spokesperson added: ""While the posts are still present on Facebook, they are no longer being promoted as the paid-for campaign has ended."" One Labour MP said it was an ""outrageous"" use of public money. The adverts were about ""social issues, elections or politics"", according to Facebook's Ad Library Facebook's Ad Library says,externalthe adverts were run without a disclaimer and were taken down. The ""MyTown"" campaign promoted the government's Â£3.6bn Towns Fund in several key general election battlegrounds, such as Northampton, Milton Keynes and Mansfield. Each of these contain a marginal constituency, one where there were fewer than 2,000 votes separating the top two candidates in the last general election or parliamentary by-election. Parliament has not yet been dissolved and the civil service has not yet entered the pre-election period, known as ""purdah"", where it is barred from making major announcements that might influence the outcome of the vote. But the ads went live on Tuesday, the same day Boris Johnson secured support for an early general election on 12 December. Government accused over 'political' Facebook ads Government pauses Â£100m Brexit ad campaign Facebook challenged over political ad policy Facebook said the taxpayer-funded ads ""were not correctly labelled"" as being about ""social issues, elections or politics"", in line with its self-enacted system to make social and political advertising more transparent. A spokesman said: ""Ads about social issues, elections or politics that appear on our platforms should include a disclaimer provided by advertisers."" It comes as Facebook comes underpressure over its policies on fact-checking political advertisingand as rival social media giantTwitter banned political advertsaltogether. Labour MP Ian Lucas wrote to Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove objecting to the campaign, saying the targeted areas appeared to be selected for political reasons. ""It would be an insult to our intelligence to say that this isn't public money being used for political purposes. It clearly is,"" he told HuffPost UK, calling the campaign ""outrageous"". A government spokesman told the BBC that the posts were published before the election was announced. ""All towns selected were chosen according to the same selection methodology, including analysis of deprivation, exposure to Brexit, productivity, economy resilience and investment opportunities,"" he said.

"Fitness device marker Fitbit is being bought by Google for $2.1bn (Â£1.6bn). The move allows Google to expand into the market for fitness trackers and smart watches. It comes at a time when loss-making Fitbit has been looking to expand into other areas. ""Google is an ideal partner to advance our mission,"" said James Park, co-founder and chief executive of Fitbit. The bid values Fitbit at $7.35 a share, a premium of about 19% to the stock's closing price on Thursday. ""With Google's resources and global platform, Fitbit will be able to accelerate innovation in the wearables category, scale faster and make health even more accessible to everyone,"" said Mr Park, who founded Fitbit 12 years ago. The company, one of the first sellers of tech-enabled fitness trackers, was valued at more than $4bn at the time of its flotation in 2015. It has sold more than 100 million devices, but has struggled with waning demand for its products as other companies enter the market. It put itself up for sale last month. Its shares have jumped 40% since Monday, when Reuters reported the interest from Google. James Park founded Fitbit 12 years ago The transaction is expected to be completed in 2020, pending approval by the board and regulators. Regulators in the US and abroad have been taking a closer look at acquisitions by the tech giants, amid growing concerns about monopoly power. Fitbit said its ""health and wellness"" data would not be used for Google adverts and pledged to maintain strong privacy protections. But analysts said the health data was key the deal. ""The deep health and fitness data, coupled with the 28 million active users on the Fitbit platform, offer a tremendous value,"" Craig Hallum analysts wrote in a note cited by Reuters. Analysis by Dave Lee, BBC North America technology reporter Here's a deal that makes perfect sense for Google. While $2.1bn is a pretty hefty premium given Fitbit's market value was around the $1.4bn-mark last week, it's small change when considered against the bigger picture of gaining a huge amount of health data. For Fitbit, it's a noble exit after putting up a decent fight in the years since the launch of Apple's smartwatch. A Fitbit-Google product could mean Wear OS - Google's wearable operating system - will get a much-needed boost. I do wonder, though, how Fitbit's 28 million users will feel about this. Anecdotally, I know several people who have told me that Fitbit's relative autonomy from the tech giants was an incentive to buy their products (though Fitbit has used Google's cloud to support its service since 2018). By next year, the health data Fitbit has on its users today will become Google's data - a valuable acquisition for Google, undoubtedly, but one that I predict could make consumers uncomfortable.

"All those affected by the contaminated blood scandal should receive the same financial support, no matter where they live in the UK, says the judge in charge of the inquiry. Sir Brian Langstaff said there was ""no proper justification"" for the ""grinding hardship of many"". Nearly 3,000 people died in the biggest treatment disaster in NHS history. The government told the BBC it was committed to guaranteeing equal support for all those affected across the UK. The judge's comments come on the last day of evidence from infected victims and their families. The long-awaited UK-wide public inquiry, which has heard personal stories from more than 180 people and thousands more in written evidence, will hear from clinicians and experts from February. It was set up to look at the scandal of up to 30,000 people being infected with contaminated blood and blood products in the 1970s and 80s. Most had haemophilia or other blood disorders, but people who had blood transfusions are also thought to have been exposed. The secret in my blood 'Blood contaminated with HIV killed our boy' Blood inquiry seeks answers at last Why the NHS gave thousands HIV-contaminated blood Sir Brian Langstaff, inquiry judge, said: ""The grinding hardship of many is not put on hold whilst the inquiry continues. ""If, as a number of witnesses have argued, there is in truth no proper justification for significant variations in financial support as between the nations of the UK, then there can be no proper reason for those variations to be perpetuated to await the outcome of the Inquiry.""

"It is the first time tourists have been allowed inside the cave since the rescue last year Tourists have entered Thailand's Tham Luang cave for the first time since the dramatic rescue last year of 12 boys and their football coach. Some 2,000 visitors flocked to the cave on Friday,external, hoping to be among the first to enter, the Bangkok Post reports. The Wild Boars youth team caught the world's attention when they got trapped in the flooded cave for 17 days. They were all eventually freed in an international rescue effort that involved more than 90 divers. The cave in Thailand's northern Chiang Rai province was officially opened to tourists in an inauguration ceremony on Friday. Jongklai Worapongsathork, the deputy director-general of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation, led the ceremony, which was attended by monks, government officials and park rangers.

People queued to enter the cave as it opened to the public on Friday More than a million people have visited the cave in the past year, but they have not been allowed to go inside. The team, aged between 11 and 16, and their 25-year-old coach became trapped on 23 June 2018 while exploring the cave complex, when a downpour flooded the tunnels.

"Trade in some species, including some types of crocodiles, is banned outright People buying animal ""souvenirs"" have been warned they must check they are legal after police seized a number of crocodile skulls imported from China. Police are investigating the finds after searching two properties in Machynlleth, Powys, on Wednesday. Dyfed-Powys Police and North Wales Police said they had found ""numerous"" skulls across the searches. Animal trade charity Traffic said importers and buyers must make sure they had the correct permits. Richard Thomas, from Traffic, said some people would buy things such as skulls as a ""talking point"". Trade in some species, including some types of crocodiles, is banned outright, but others can be bought and sold as long as the exporting country issues permits. Earlier this month, policeseized a skull of a critically endangered Siamese crocodilefrom a man in Chippenham, Wiltshire, after he paid about Â£30 to a buyer in China. Wiltshire Police said the man bought it as an ""unusual"" house ornament and had no idea that it was protected.

"John Bercow is demanding an apology from the Daily Mirror over claims he asked for Â£1m to appear on ""I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here!"" The outgoing Commons Speaker has accused the paper of ""publishing lies despite being advised of the truth"" and has complained to the press watchdog. The Mirror claimed talks between Mr Bercow and ITV broke down over the size of his appearance fee. It said it stood by its story, which was based on ""authoritative sources"". However, the newspaper also said it was ""happy to accept"" that Mr Bercow had ""no serious desire to appear"" on the programme. Mr Bercow, who retired on Thursday after 10 years in the Speaker's chair, is understood to be furious about the story. In a letter to the Mirror's showbiz editor, he said: ""I must make it clear to you in the most uncompromising terms that I have not had the slightest interest now or at any time or an any basis to go on that programme."" He adds that he ""did not at any time to anybody ask for Â£1m to go on the show, which I consider to be utterly trashy"". He demands an apology from the paper and threatens legal action, if the ""false allegations"" are repeated. John Bercow is waving goodbye to Westminster after 22 years as an MP and 10 as Speaker The Mirror suggested representatives for Mr Bercow had been in talks with ITV about him appearing on the next series of the reality show, in which celebrities take part in a series of eye-watering challenges, such as eating insects or being trapped underground with snakes. It said Mr Bercow had ""allegedly demanded a Â£1m fee"" for appearing in the next series, due to start in December. This was Â£400,000 more than any previous contestant had received, the newspaper reported. It suggested ITV had confirmed discussions had broken down over the question of Mr Bercow's fee, quoting an unnamed source saying ""he has priced himself out of the market"". Mr Bercow has written to the Independent Press Standards Organisation to claim it is factually untrue and a breach of the editor's code. In its response, the watchdog said: ""We are looking at the points you raise, and will be in touch shortly."" Last Orderrrrs! Speaker John Bercow in numbers In a text message to TV agent Nicki Clarke, who originally approached Mr Bercow with the idea of appearing, ITV talent producer Micky Van Praagh suggested the story was ""obviously nonsense and I have no idea where it has come from"". She added: ""ITV has not confirmed that talks broke down because of money. Please can you apologise to John for me for the story."" In an e-mail to Mr Bercow, Ms Clarke, who works for Shine Talent Management, said the story was ""incredibly frustrating"" and she had expressed her ""grave concern"" to ITV about it. The Mirror said the story was ""based on information from authoritative sources"". ""We are confident that conversations took place between ITV and a representative for John Bercow about appearing on I'm a Celebrity and that these talks broke down over money,"" a spokesman said. A host of politicians have appeared on I'm A Celebrity over the years, including Conservative MP Nadine Dorries and Boris Johnson's father, Stanley. Last month, Boris Johnson joked that he would like to see Mr Bercow perform the infamous Bushtucker Trial and eat a kangaroo's testicle.

"The government's MyTown campaign The government has been accused of using public funds to target voters in key general election constituencies with Facebook ads. The ads say: ""the Government is investing up to Â£25m"" in the town where the message appears on Facebook feeds. They went live on Tuesday - the same day Boris Johnson secured support for an early general election. Labour MP Ian Lucas called it an ""outrageous"" misuse of public funds,according to The Huffington Post.,external The seventeen adverts are part of the government's ""MyTown"" campaign on Facebook. Government pauses Â£100m Brexit ad campaign How does Stronger Towns Fund compare with EU funding? Several of the towns, such as Northampton, Milton Keynes and Mansfield, are home to constituencies that will be key battlegrounds in the general election, with majorities of less than 2,000. The campaign promotes the government's Â£3.6bn Towns Fund, which aims to increase investment in neglected parts of the country. The Facebook ads used for the government's MyTown campaign The ads, paid for by taxpayers, are not marked as being about ""social issues, elections or politics"". This is the system that Facebook has put in place to help with the transparency of social and political ads on its platforms. Other adverts by the UK government, such as the ""Get Ready for Brexit"" campaign, are flagged in this way. Not flagging them also means they disappear from the Facebook Ad Library once they are no longer active - and that it is not possible to find out how much the government has spent on them. Two of the ads have now been taken down after Facebook determined they were ""about social issues, elections or politics"" and required the disclaimer. Facebook's policies around political advertisinghave come under scrutinyin recent days asTwitter announced it would ban all paid political messages. By the BBC's Paul Sargeant Facebook has about 40 million users in the UK and most of the content people see on site is from their friends or pages they have liked. Anyone can also pay to have content shown to people who haven't liked their page - and they can chose who sees this paid-for content by targeting things like gender, age, location, or interests. Political parties also use this paid-for content to reach new people. The difference is Facebook ask that any content about ""about social issues, elections or politics"" is labelled by the organisation posting it. This political content is archived and can be searched for in the Facebook Ad Library. Meaning for every political advert it's possible to check who paid for it and get a rough idea of who has been shown the ad and how many times it has been seen. However, the system of labelling political adverts is voluntary. If an organisation fails to label their paid-for content, the adverts are only searchable while they are active on the site. This loophole could allow political organisations to hide old adverts or at least make them much harder to find. Mr Lucas has written a letter to Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove demanding to know how data for the campaign was gathered and accusing the government using public money for political purposes. ""It is quite clear that those constituencies are, largely, politically contentious. ""These marginal constituencies appear to have been selected on a political basis,"" his letter said. He told the Huffington Post: ""It is an example of how the government is merging political activity with the arms of government in its own political interest."" Labour's Shadow Communities Secretary Andrew Gwynne said the proposed cash injection was a ""drop in the ocean compared to the billions the Conservatives have cut from local communities"". A government spokesman told the BBC that ministers would respond to Mr Lucas' letter, but added: ""These posts were published before the election was called and Parliament has not yet been dissolved. ""All towns selected were chosen according to the same selection methodology, including analysis of deprivation, exposure to Brexit, productivity, economy resilience and investment opportunities."" The government has been the biggest UK spender on Facebook political adverts in the last month. The most recent figures available on Facebook's ad library site cover spending between 22 and 28 October and show that the government spent Â£192,753 in that period. All of the spending was on ads promoting the Get Ready for Brexit campaign. In second place was the People's Vote campaign for another EU referendum with spending of Â£52,234.

Jeremy Corbyn vowed to ""transform"" Britain by taking on ""the few who run a corrupt system"" as he kicked off Labour's election campaign. The party leader promised to ""rebuild"" public services and hit out at ""tax dodgers, dodgy landlords, bad bosses and big polluters"". In a speech, Mr Corbyn called the 12 December poll a ""once-in-a-generation chance to transform our country"". But Prime Minister Boris Johnson blamed Mr Corbyn for the delay to Brexit. He said he was ""incredibly frustrated"" that the 31 October deadline had to be extended, but a Conservative election win would remove the ""logjam"". Both leaders, and those of other parties, are beginning six weeks of campaigning. Johnson and Corbyn: The odd couple? A really simple guide to the UK general election Corbyn challenges Johnson to election TV debate Your questions answered: Could snow delay the vote? In a speech at Battersea Arts Centre, south London, Mr Corbyn received loud cheers from supporters when he said Labour would launch ""the biggest people-powered campaign in history"". After Jeremy Corbyn mentioned the NHS, Labour supporters chanted: ""Not for sale."" Flanked by members of the shadow cabinet, he said: ""You know what really scares the elite? What they're actually afraid of is paying their taxes. So in this election they'll fight harder and dirtier than ever before. They'll throw everything at us because they know we're not afraid to take them on. ""So we're going after the tax dodgers. We're going after the dodgy landlords. We're going after the bad bosses. We're going after the big polluters. Because we know whose side we're on."" The December election was called for by the prime minister  and is taking place after Mr Corbyn agreed to it, following the EU's decision to delay Brexit. The Labour leader told the audience that, if elected prime minister, he would ""open negotiations with the EU about a sensible relationship with Europe"". This wasn't exactly a pitch for the centre ground by Jeremy Corbyn. His tone was uncompromising. It's designed in part - just like in 2017 - to enthuse younger voters and previous non-voters, convincing them that politics can make a difference. But he is also searching for a message that might appeal beyond Brexit - to potential Labour voters in both Leave and Remain areas. Labour launched its election campaign in the London seat of Battersea. It doggedly campaigned here in 2017, and won narrowly - it now leads the Conservatives by just 2,416 votes. It's a reminder that the party will have to work hard to defend seats - as well as targets held by its opponents.

""People aren't fooled so easily. They know the Conservatives are the establishment elite.""

"A revised Brexit deal has been agreed by the UK and EU. What is in it? Most of the changes - to the deal agreed by Theresa May with EU in November 2018 - are to do with the status of the Irish border after Brexit. This issue has dominated talks for months. All sides want to avoid the return of a ""hard border"" between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland after Brexit - with checks and infrastructure that could be targeted by paramilitary groups. Coming up with solutions to this - acceptable to all sides - has been very challenging. The new protocol,externalreplaces the controversial Irish backstop plan in Theresa May's deal. Much of the rest of that deal will remain. Here are some of the key new parts: The whole of the UK will leave the EU customs union. The customs union is an agreement between EU countries not to charge taxes called tariffs on things coming from other EU countries, and to charge the same tariffs as each other on things coming from outside the EU. Leaving the customs union means the UK will be able to strike trade deals with other countries in the future. Legally there will be a customs border between Northern Ireland (which stays in the UK) and the Republic of Ireland (which stays in the EU), but in practice things won't be checked on that border. The actual checks will be on what is effectively a customs border between Great Britain and the island of Ireland, with goods being checked at ""points of entry"" into Northern Ireland. Taxes will only have to be paid on goods being moved from Great Britain to Northern Ireland if those products are considered ""at risk"" of then being transported into the Republic of Ireland. A joint committee made up of UK and EU representatives will decide at a later date what goods are considered ""at risk"". If taxes are paid on ""at risk"" goods that do not end up being sent on from Northern Ireland into the EU, the UK would be responsible for whether to refund the money. Individual travellers won't have their baggage checked and taxes will not have to be paid by individuals sending goods to other people. Separately, there will be limits agreed by the joint committee on the amount of help the government can give to Northern Irish farmers. The figure will be based on the amount they currently receive from the EU's Common Agricultural Policy. Where have the UK and EU compromised? Brexit deal: What does it mean? Brexit: What happens now? Have UK voters changed their minds on Brexit? When it comes to the regulation of goods (that's the rules they have to follow on things like labelling and manufacturing processes) Northern Ireland would keep to EU rules rather than UK rules. That removes the need for checks on goods including food and agricultural produce at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, because both will be part of an ""all-island regulatory zone"". But it adds to the checks between the rest of the UK - which will not necessarily be sticking to EU single market rules - and Northern Ireland. This will be done by UK officials at ""points of entry"" into Northern Ireland, but the EU will have the right to have its own officials present. It seems those EU officials may be able to overrule UK officials. The agreement states that EU representatives will be able to ask UK authorities to take certain steps in individual cases and they will have to do so. Because Northern Ireland will be set apart from the rest of the UK when it comes to customs and other EU rules, the deal gives its Assembly a vote on these new arrangements. But this vote would not happen until four years after the end of the transition period (the time after Brexit when everything stays the same to allow everyone to prepare for the changes while the UK's future relationship with the EU is discussed). The transition period is due to run until at least the end of 2020. So the four-year period would run until the end of 2024. If the Northern Ireland Assembly votes against the new arrangements, they would stop applying two years later, during which time the ""joint committee"" would make recommendations to the UK and EU on what to do about this. If there were to be no agreement during this two year period, some form of hard border could re-emerge in Ireland, but it's unlikely that would be allowed to happen. If the Assembly accepts the continuing provisions by a simple majority, they will then apply for another four years. If the deal has ""cross-community support"" then they will apply for eight years. The deal defines cross-community support as more than 50% of unionist and nationalist Assembly members voting in favour, or at least 40% of members from each designation if in total at least 60% of members have voted in favour. The UK government has said that if the Northern Ireland Assembly is still not sitting at that point,it will make alternative arrangements to make sure a vote can take place.,external The new agreement says thatEU law on value added tax,external(VAT - a tax added when you make purchases) will apply in Northern Ireland, but only on goods, not services. But it also allows Northern Ireland to have different VAT rates to the rest of the UK, which would not normally be allowed under EU law. For example, if the UK decided to reduce the VAT on household fuel to zero, Northern Ireland would still have to keep it at 5%, which is the EU minimum. It also means that Northern Ireland may get the same VAT rates on certain goods as the Republic of Ireland, to stop there being an unfair advantage on either side of the border. Much of Mrs May's original Brexit deal will remain as part of the overall agreement. Some of the key areas are: The transition - a period of time during which all of the current rules stay the same allowing the UK and the EU to negotiate their future relationship - is due to last until the end of December 2020. The UK will need to abide by EU rules and pay into the EU budget, but will lose membership of its institutions. The transition can be extended, but only for a period of one or two years. Both the UK and EU must agree to any extension. UK citizens in the EU, and EU citizens in the UK, will retain their residency and social security rights after Brexit. Freedom of movement rules will continue to apply during transition. This means that UK nationals will be able to live and work in EU countries (and EU nationals will be able to live and work in UK) during this period. Anyone who remains in the same EU country for five years will be allowed to apply for permanent residence. (UPDATE: 13 December 2019 - This piece has been updated and reflects the delay of the Brexit date to the end of January 2020.) The UK will have to settle its financial obligations to the EU. There is no precise figure but the biggest part of this ""divorce bill"" will be the UK contributions to the EU budget until the end of the transition period at the end of 2020. When Brexit was delayed it meant that some of that money was paid as the UK's normal membership contributions, so less of it was part of the divorce bill. When the Brexit date was 31 October 2019, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR)estimated,externalthat the bill was about Â£32.8bn (down from Â£39bn). To reach an estimate of what the bill would be for departure on 31 January 2020, you could subtract the Â£1.62bn thatthe OBR said,externalwas left to pay in membership fees in 2019 and 14% of the Â£10.69bn for the whole of 2020 (it's more than one twelfth because the EU usually requests a higher proportion of the contributions earlier in the year). That gives a total of just under Â£30bn. The OBR expects that most of the money - about three-quarters of the total - would be paid by 2022, with some relatively small payments still being made in the 2060s. This is addressed in the political declaration.This text, which is not legally binding, has also been revised by UK/EU negotiators.,external It says that both sides will work towards a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) and a high-level meeting will happen in June 2020 to see how that work is going. The text also contains a new paragraph on the so-called ""level playing field"" - the degree to which the UK will agree to stick closely to EU regulations in the future. The references to a ""level playing field"" were removed from the legally-binding withdrawal agreement and put in the political declaration, which is not binding. It says that both sides will keep the same high standards on state aid, competition, social and employment standards, the environment, climate change, and ""relevant tax matters"".

"This video can not be played General election 2019: Farage tells Johnson to 'drop the deal' Nigel Farage has called on Boris Johnson to drop his Brexit deal or face his party's candidates in every seat. Speaking at the Brexit Party's election campaign launch, he called on the PM to ""build a Leave alliance"" and seek a free trade agreement with the EU. If Mr Johnson refuses, Mr Farage said he already had 500 candidates he could field against the Tories in seats across England, Scotland and Wales. The Conservatives have consistently ruled out a formal pact with the party. A Tory source told the BBC: ""A vote for Farage risks letting Jeremy Corbyn into Downing Street via the back door. It will not get Brexit done and it will create another gridlocked Parliament that doesn't work."" It comes after President Donald Trump said Mr Farage and Boris Johnson shouldteam up as ""an unstoppable force"". As it happened: Brexit Party campaign launch First head-to-head TV election debate announced What is in Boris Johnson's new Brexit deal? Recent opinion polls have shown the Conservatives with a double-digit lead over Labour. Polling expert Sir John Curtice said Boris Johnson had received a boost after he negotiated a deal with the EU and brought the deal back to Parliament before 31 October deadline. However, MPs turned down his plan to pass the deal in three days, leading to a three month extension to the deadline - something vocal Brexiteers, including Mr Farage, have criticised the PM for. Having not got Brexit through by Halloween, some Tories fear that Mr Farage's candidates could split the pro-Brexit vote and prevent their party from winning a majority in 12 December poll. This video can not be played Ten moments that led to an(other) election Mr Farage used the launch to condemn the PM's deal, urging him to ""drop [it] because it is not Brexit"". Instead, Mr Farage urged him to pursue a free trade agreement with the EU - similar to the deal the bloc has with Canada - and to impose a new deadline of 1 July 2020 to get it signed off. If an agreement was not done by then, the UK should leave the EU without a deal and move to World Trade Organisation trading rules. ""I would view that as totally reasonable,"" he said. ""That really would be Brexit."" Could US companies run NHS services after Brexit? Jeremy Corbyn vows to 'transform' UK But Mr Farage said if Mr Johnson did not pursue the route, the Brexit Party would contest every seat in the country - with 500 candidates ready to sign the forms to stand on Monday. ""The Brexit Party would be the only party standing at these elections that actually represents Brexit,"" he said. But Tory Brexiteer Mark Francois said Mr Farage's pitch for an alliance had ""screwed it up"". ""If you genuinely want to work with another party, you don't go on live national television and call them liars,"" he told BBC Radio 4's World at One. He said the PM's agreement with the EU was not a ""perfect deal"", adding: ""We are not in Valhalla here. But the deal takes us out of the European Union. ""Nigel is a very talented politician but anyone who works with him will tell you he is his own worst enemy and his ego has got the better of him."" Nigel Farage has, in effect, given Boris Johnson an ultimatum - abandon your central Brexit policy or the Brexit Party will challenge your deal at every opportunity across the country. With the prime minister highly likely to refuse, it seems Mr Farage will have to live up to his promise of fielding 500 or more candidates in this election by Monday - and his claim that he has the resources to do so. That's a tall order for a party that only launched in April. He's no doubt buoyed by the Brexit Party's success in the European elections earlier this year. But in the past, when at the helm of UKIP, Mr Farage has struggled to turn popular support into Westminster seats. He has been targeting Labour leave areas in Wales, the Midlands and the North of England - the very seats Mr Johnson has in his sights. But the risk for both parties is by splitting the Leave vote they give Jeremy Corbyn an unintended boost. Mr Farage also attacked Labour for a ""complete and utter betrayal on Brexit"" - and said his party would target Labour seats in the Midlands and North of England. He said Labour's plan to renegotiate a deal then put it to a referendum was offering a choice of ""remain or effectively remain"". Mr Farage said there were five million Labour voters who had supported Leave in the 2016 EU referendum -although that is likely to be an overestimate- meaning his party ""posed a very major problem"" for Jeremy Corbyn. ""So many Labour Leave seats are represented by Remain members of Parliament,"" he said. ""We view those constituencies around the country among our top targets."" He ridiculed the reportedConservative plan to target ""Workington man""- Leave-supporting traditional Labour voters in northern towns - saying Tories needed to get out of London more. Nigel Farage claimed in his speech that when UKIP did well under his leadership, it was doing more damage to Labour than the Conservatives. Yet, he seems to think the threat of standing everywhere is going to have an impact on the Tories' Brexit stance by making them afraid they are going to lose out. At the end of the day, what Nigel Farage is promising is to fight this election across the piece and on a stance which the Brexit Party has been very clear about for a while. The interesting question there is how successful he is going to be persuading the Leave voters of this argument. Boris Johnson and the Conservative Party have a lead as they have been gradually squeezing the Brexit Party vote, with Leave voters coming to them. Relatively few Leave voters seem to blame Mr Johnson for the fact that he failed to meet the 31 October deadline. But on the other hand, it is also clear from the polling there is a substantial body of Leave voters who would prefer to exit without a deal rather than supporting the PM's plan. So, you can see how Mr Farage may be able to push some people back in his direction. On the other side of the Brexit debate,Remain-supporting parties have been negotiating electoral pacts in certain constituencies. The potential agreements would see the Liberal Democrats, Greens and Plaid Cymru stand aside for each other to ensure the election of as many MPs who back a second Brexit referendum as possible. Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley said it was ""no secret"" that the his party was ""talking to the Lib Dems and Plaid"" but ""nothing has been finalised"". Elsewhere on the election trail: Both the Tories and Labour are fighting offcriticisms from US President Donald Trump No 10 has defended the PM's Brexit deal - which Mr Trump said would hamper any deal with the US - saying it would allow the UK ""strike free trade deals around the world"" Jeremy Corbyn accused the president of trying to ""interfere"" in the election after he said the Labour leader would be ""so bad"" as PM The SNP's leader and First Minister of Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon, has been campaigning in Leith She said the upcoming election was a chance for Scotland to ""escape the Brexit chaos"" and become an independent EU country Meanwhile, a poll by Teacher Tapp found one in 12 primary school teachers say nativity plays and Christmas concerts will be disrupted by the election Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser LA mayor says winds and drought created 'perfect storm', while officials hit out at looters Biden praises Carter's character as former president's coffin heads to Georgia Henry Zeffman: Market trouble threatens Labour's economic plans The '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: Election pact with Brexit Party 'risks putting Corbyn into No 10' Boris Johnson has rejected the suggestion from Nigel Farage and Donald Trump that he should work with the Brexit Party during the election. The Tory leader told the BBC he was ""always grateful for advice"" but he would not enter into election pacts. His comments come after the US president said Mr Farage and Mr Johnson would be ""an unstoppable force"". Downing Street sources say there are no circumstances in which the Tories would work with the Brexit Party. In an interview with BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg, the prime minister said the ""difficulty"" of doing deals with ""any other party"" was that it ""simply risks putting Jeremy Corbyn into Number 10"". ""The problem with that is that his [Mr Corbyn's] plan for Brexit is basically yet more dither and delay,"" Mr Johnson said. Mr Johnson also said there was ""no question of negotiating on the NHS"" as part of any future trade deal with the US, but he did not rule out expanding the amount of private provision in the health service in the future. But Labour's shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said the public ""can't trust the Tories on the NHS"", saying they would ""increase privatisation even further and do a deal with Donald Trump"". Kuenssberg: Colourful words no guarantee of election success First head-to-head TV election debate announced Jeremy Corbyn vows to 'transform' UK Could the NHS be ""up for sale"" to US companies? A really simple guide to the UK general election Farage calls on Johnson to 'build Leave alliance' When pushed on whether he would rule out a deal with Mr Farage, Mr Johnson replied: ""I want to be very, very clear that voting for any other party than this government, this Conservative governmentâ¦ is basically tantamount to putting Jeremy Corbyn in."" The UK is going to the polls on 12 December following a further delay to the UK's departure from the EU, to 31 January 2020. The BBC will be talking to other party leaders during the course of the campaign. US president Donald Trumptold Nigel Farage's LBC show on Thursday,externalthat the Brexit Party leader should team up with Mr Johnson to do ""something terrific"" and he also criticised the prime minister's EU withdrawal agreement. Meanwhile, Mr Farage has called on the prime minister to drop his Brexit deal, unite in a ""Leave alliance"" or face a Brexit Party candidate in every seat in the election. Mr Johnson said there were ""lots of reasons"" why he thought a Labour government would be a ""disaster"". He said he Labour government would lead to a renegotiation with Brussels on a Brexit deal, then another referendum. ""Why go through that nightmare again?"" he said. The prime minister also suggested that the US president was wrong to believe a trade deal would be impossible with the UK after Brexit. Mr Johnson said his ""proper Brexit"" deal ""enables us to do proper all-singing, all-dancing free-trade deals"". This video can not be played Farage: Trump is a 'fan of Boris Johnson' ""It delivers exactly what we wanted, what I wanted, when I campaigned in 2016 to come out the European Union,"" Mr Johnson said. When asked about the criticism from Mr Trump, Mr Johnson said: ""I am always grateful for advice from wherever it comes and we have great relations as you know with the US and many many other countries. ""But on the technicalities of the deal anybody who looks at it can see that the UK has full control."" The prime minister is never short of a word or two, never short of a colourful phrase or a metaphor. When we sat down this afternoon there wasno suggestion of him being the Hulk,external, but Remain-tending MPs were accused of ""rope-a-doping"" the government, planning eventually to batter the prime minister and his Brexit deal into submission until he would have had to give up. But in Downing Street there is a serious awareness that trademark Johnson verbal gymnastics are no guarantee of success at the ballot box in six weeks' time, no guarantee at all. That's not just because there are even friends, like Donald Trump, and of course foes, like Jeremy Corbyn, whose words and actions will hamper his attempt to secure a majority to call his own. But also because this is a snap election, not a routine poll, and the public is hardly in a forgiving mood of our politicians right now. Read more from Laura Mr Johnson said he hoped the government could get Brexit ""over the line"" by the middle of January if he won a majority, claiming the current Parliament would never have passed his deal. He said he'd had ""no choice"" but to call a general election, saying: ""Nobody wants an election but we've got to do it now. ""This is a Parliament that is basically full of MPs who voted Remain. ""They voted Remain and they will continue to block Brexit if they're given the chance - we need a new mandate, we need to refresh our Parliament."" Mr Johnson said his government was determined to increase taxpayer funding of the NHS but said: ""Of course there are dentists and optometrists and so on who are providers to the NHS, of course, that's how it works,"" he said. ""But... I believe passionately in an NHS free at the point of use for everybody in this country.""

"The UK is gearing up to hold a general election on Thursday. These national votes, to choose a government to run the country, are supposed to be held every five years. But this would be the third since 2015. A total of 650 people will be chosen asmembers of Parliament (MPs), to decide laws and policies. Members of Parliament are elected by voters to represent the interests of their constituency in the House of Commons. Most belong to a political party, but some do stand as independents. There are 650 MPs in the House. MPs are elected to the House of Commons, one of two chambers of Parliament in London, where the government is based. The government passes laws that help it run the country. This compares with local governments which deal with issues such as bin collections and schools in each area. In a general election, the UK's 46 million voters are invited to choose an MP for their area - one of 650 constituencies. Anyone aged 18 or over can vote, as long as they are registered and a British citizen or qualifying citizen of the Commonwealth or Republic of Ireland. Older people are more likely than younger ones to vote. At the 2017 general election, 59% of 20- to 24-year-olds voted, compared with 77% of 60- to 69-year-olds. However, about two-thirds of the more than 3.1 million people who registered to vote between the election being called and the registration deadline were under the age of 35, with more than a million of them under 25. Voting takes place at local polling stations, set up in places such as churches and school halls. Voters put a cross on the ballot paper beside the name of their chosen candidate and drop it into a sealed ballot box. Most people over 18 on polling day can stand as a candidate - as long as they are a British citizen or a qualifying Commonwealth or Republic of Ireland citizen resident in the UK. They must also pay a Â£500 deposit, which will be lost if they do not get at least 5% of the votes in their constituency. Candidates must meet certain conditions - prisoners, civil servants, judges and members of the police and armed forces cannot stand. A total of 3,322 candidates are standing across the 650 seats this year. There are 91 Davids standing for election - the most popular name among the candidates - while the first female name on the list is Sarah in 18th place. There are 22 candidates with that first name standing. The candidate with the most votes in each constituency is elected, even if they are chosen by less than half the electorate in their seat. Most MPs represent a political party but some stand for election as independent candidates. Any party with more than half the MPs (326) in the Commons usually forms the government. Parties with well below 50% of the national vote can take power as a result of theUK's voting system. The UK uses a first past the post voting system. It means a local candidate who receives the most votes wins â and the party with the most winning candidates forms a government. So the overall number of votes parties get nationally does not have any bearing on who wins the election. If no party has a majority of MPs, the one with the most can form a coalition - or partnership - with one or more other parties to gain control. The prime minister is not directly voted for by the public. He or she is chosen by the winning party's MPs and appointed bythe Queen, who is duty bound to follow their advice. The Queen is the UKâs head of state, although she is not in charge of the government. Elizabeth II is the countryâs longest-serving monarch, having ascended to the throne in 1952. She performs state duties, which include formally opening Parliament, representing the country at events such as the annual Remembrance Day parade, and making official visits overseas. She is also head of the armed forces and Church of England. Detailed proposals for everything from the economy to defence and policing are set out before any general election inmanifestos. A manifesto is basically a brochure containing all of a party's ideas and policies. Manifestos are usually published during the general election campaign. If a party wins the election, it is often judged by how many of its manifesto promises it manages to deliver as a government. These come from the UK's political parties - groups of people with similar political beliefs who come together to try to win power. The issues UK voters care most about have changed a lot, according to the polls. TheNational Health Service (NHS)and immigration were the things that most concerned voters in 2015. The National Health Service (NHS), which started in 1948, is the government-funded national healthcare service that provides free diagnosis and treatment for UK citizens. TheEuropean Union (EU)was of far less interest. European Union: the political and economic union of 28 member states, which the UK is planning to leave. Now, however,Brexit- the UK's departure from the EU - is a huge issue. Short for British exit - refers to the UK leaving the European Union. Neither the Conservative orLabourparties had enough votes to form a majority government after the 2017 election. The Labour Party was founded by the trade union movement in 1900 to give workers a voice in Parliament. It believes in the redistribution of wealth and opportunity, greater rights for working people and strong, state-run public services. The Conservatives were the bigger of the two parties and formed a partnership with the Democratic Unionist PartyDUPin order to win votes in the Commons. The Democratic Unionist Party was founded in 1971, during the time of conflict in Northern Ireland, known as the Troubles. As unionists, the DUP support Northern Ireland being part of the UK and are known for their socially conservative beliefs on abortion and same-sex marriage. After the 2017 election, DUP MPs helped keep the Conservatives in power by agreeing to support them in Commons votes. Since the election, the Conservatives and Labour have both lost MPs, while theLiberal Democratshave made gains. Often called the Lib Dems, the Liberal Democrats were formed in 1988 by the merger of one of Britain's oldest political institutions, the Liberal Party, which stood for free trade and individual liberty, and the Social Democratic Party, a centrist offshoot of the Labour Party. The party likes to see itself as being on the centre ground of British politics. Parliament's second chamber is theHouse of Lords. The House of Lords is the second chamber of the UK Parliament. It is independent from the House of Commons but shares with it the role of making laws, while it also checks the governmentâs work. Members are given a title, such as Lord, are not elected, do not represent constituencies and most do not belong to any party. Its members are not elected but are appointed by the Queen, on the prime minister's advice. On general election day, voting takes place between 07:00 and 22:00. The results are declared through the night and the following day. When the overall result is known, the leader of the winning party, if there is one, visits Buckingham Palace to ask the Queen for permission to form a new government. Once they have that, which is a formality, they return to the traditional home of the prime minister10 Downing Street. This terraced house is the official residence and office of the UK prime minister. Often they will stand outside to deliver a speech about their party's plans for the coming years.

"All those affected by the contaminated blood scandal should receive the same financial support, no matter where they live in the UK, says the judge in charge of the inquiry. Sir Brian Langstaff said there was ""no proper justification"" for the ""grinding hardship of many"". Nearly 3,000 people died in the biggest treatment disaster in NHS history. The government told the BBC it was committed to guaranteeing equal support for all those affected across the UK. The judge's comments come on the last day of evidence from infected victims and their families. The long-awaited UK-wide public inquiry, which has heard personal stories from more than 180 people and thousands more in written evidence, will hear from clinicians and experts from February. It was set up to look at the scandal of up to 30,000 people being infected with contaminated blood and blood products in the 1970s and 80s. Most had haemophilia or other blood disorders, but people who had blood transfusions are also thought to have been exposed. The secret in my blood 'Blood contaminated with HIV killed our boy' Blood inquiry seeks answers at last Why the NHS gave thousands HIV-contaminated blood Sir Brian Langstaff, inquiry judge, said: ""The grinding hardship of many is not put on hold whilst the inquiry continues. ""If, as a number of witnesses have argued, there is in truth no proper justification for significant variations in financial support as between the nations of the UK, then there can be no proper reason for those variations to be perpetuated to await the outcome of the Inquiry."" There are different financial assistance schemes in the four countries of the UK, with Scotland's being the most generous. This video can not be played Contaminated Blood Inquiry: ""It's all been covered up"" The judge said increased payments in April to those affected in England had helped, but there were still ""continuing variations between the home nations"". He highlighted the evidence from a widow who became homeless after her husband's death from infected blood. She had to spend time caring for him instead of working for a wage. The government said lessons must be learnt so that a tragedy of this scale could never happen again. ""Recognising that there are legitimate concerns about unequal financial support across the UK, we are working with the devolved administrations so that we can meet our commitment to guarantee equal support for all those infected and affected across the UK,"" a spokeswoman said. ""We plan to consult on this and understand that this is an important issue for those affected."" A campaign group representing those affected by the blood scandal has written to the prime minister asking for a meeting about securing short-term financial support. Long-term compensation for those affected is to be determined following the recommendations made at the end of the inquiry. What is the infected blood scandal?

Claire Mann, TfL's director of bus operations, offered the firm's condolences and sympathies to Mr Matcham's family and confirmed they were working with the bus operator GoAhead and the Met Police to ""ensure we find out what happened"". Counselling has also been made available to those affected by the crash, she said. GoAhead tweeted that it was raising money,externalon a crowdfunding website to support Mr Matcham's family. The crash happened in Orpington at about 22:15 GMT One witness, who did not wish to be named, said he was in his living room when ""we literally heard a loud bang"". ""It didn't sound like a car crash, it was a really weird noise,"" he said. ""I went out to take a look and saw the carnage. My son is 11 and he was really upset. We didn't really want to stay outside as it was too upsetting really."" He said one of the buses had gone into a front garden. ""My heart goes out to those involved. Very distressing,"" he added. The GoAhead single-decker bus was lifted by crane on to a tow truck Another resident, Tariq Sheik, said he heard ""an awful lot of ambulance and fire engine noises last night"" and thought it might have been connected to Halloween. ""Horrific scenes, it's not very pleasant,"" he added. Road closures are in place around the area and police have advised motorists to use alternative routes. Six bus routes have also been diverted. Detectives have appealed for any witnesses or anyone with dashcam, mobile phone or CCTV footage of the collision to contact them.

"A protester in Malaga holds up a sign saying ""No means no"" in support of the Manresa victim A Barcelona court's decision to acquit five men accused of gang-raping a 14-year-old girl of the charge of sexual assault has provoked outrage. The court ruled out rape because the victim was in an ""unconscious state"" and the accused had not used violence or intimidation. This is a requirement under Spanish law for a charge of sexual assault, which is legally the equivalent of rape. Instead, they were convicted and jailed for the lesser crime of sexual abuse. The five were sentenced to between 10 and 12 years in prison. A conviction for sexual assault would have carried prison sentences of between 15 and 20 years. A review is currently taking place in Spain to decide whether to base rape cases on a woman's explicit consent to sex. A number of European countries have changed their laws in recent years to define rape as sex without consent. Sweden changed the law last year and Denmark is doing the same. The Barcelona verdict comes despitea ruling in a similar case by the Spanish Supreme Courtupgrading a conviction from sexual abuse to sexual assault. Barcelona's Mayor Ada Colau denounced it as an ""outrageous sentence"",externalon Twitter. ""I am not a judge and I do not know how many years in prison they deserve, what I do know is that it is not abuse, it is rape!"" Warning: Some readers may find details of this story disturbing Women's rights groups have similarly reacted to the ruling with anger and dismay. Furious social media users have been commenting on the case under hashtags like JusticiaPatriarcal (Patriarchal Justice) and NoEsAbusoEsViolacion (It's not abuse it's rape). The case is known as the ""Manada de Manresa"" - Manresa Wolf Pack - for its similarities toa 2016 gang attack on a teenagerwhich prompted widespread protests and an ongoing review of Spain's rape laws. Lila Corominas, a spokeswoman for the Manresa Feminist Strike Committee, told newspaper Nius Diario this was ""an obvious case of sexual assault and intimidation"". Leader of the MÃ¡s PaÃ­s political party ÃÃ±igo ErrejÃ³n said the sentence was ""shameful"", while Irene Montero, spokeswoman for Unidas Podemos, called for a change in the law ""so we can speak proudly of living in a feminist country"". Some activists are calling for a protest against the court decision,externalin Manresa on Saturday at 13:00 local time (12:00 GMT). The five men were found guilty of abusing the girl during a drinking session known in Spanish as a botellÃ³n at a disused factory in Manresa, a town in the north-eastern region of Catalonia, in October 2016. Prosecutors told the court the men - two Spaniards, two Cubans and one Argentine - took turns to attack the girl, who was under the influence of alcohol and drugs. One of the defendants, named only as Bryan AndrÃ©s M, was said to have told each of them: ""It's your turn. Fifteen minutes each and no delay."" At a previous court hearing, the girl said she remembered very little of what happened but that one of the men had been brandishing a gun. All the defendants denied the allegations, although the DNA of one of them was found on the girl's underwear. A similar case sparked fury in Spain, and was later overturned by the Supreme Court The court ruled that the victim did ""not know what she was and wasn't doing, and consequently, did not have the ability to agree to or oppose the sexual relations most of the defendants had with her"", El Pais reported. It added that the defendants ""were able to commit sexual acts without using any type of violence or intimidation"". The court eventually awarded the victim â¬12,000 (Â£10,300) damages for an attack it described as ""extremely severe and especially denigrating"". Judges expressed ""surprise"" that the prosecutors changed the charge at the last minute to sexual assault from the initial accusation of sexual abuse. They said they could not see the reasons for the more serious assault offence in the prosecution's arguments. A court in Navarra jailed five men for sexual abuse for a gang attack in Pamplona on an 18-year-old woman who was dragged into the hallway of a residential building. As she appeared ""passive or neutral"", according to a police report, the court decided no intimidation or violence had taken place. This video can not be played Activists say rage over the ""wolfpack"" case ignited a feminist revolution (Video from 2019) In June, the Spanish Supreme Court overturned that ruling, deciding it was sexual assault and that the men were rapists. The five saw their sentences of nine years increased to 15. Spain's prime minister last year appointed a panel to review the rape laws. If you, or someone you know, have been affected by sexual abuse or violence,these organisations in the UK may be able to help.

"Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn are among the candidates competing to be prime minister The first head-to-head election debate between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn will take place on 19 November. It will be shown on ITV and hosted by news presenter Julie Etchingham. The channel said it also plans to hold a multi-party debate in the run-up to the 12 December poll. On Thursday, Labour leader Mr Corbyn challenged the PM to a one-on-one debate, while Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson said she should take part in a three-headed encounter with the two leaders. Mr Corbyn welcomed ITV's announcement on Twitter,external, claiming Mr Johnson had ""accepted our challenge"" for the ""once in a generation election"". But pro-Remain parties are not happy, with the Lib Dems criticising the line-up as a ""cosy establishment stitch-up"" and the SNP saying it would be ""deeply misleading for viewers"". A really simple guide to the UK general election Who has selected the most women as candidates? Can the Queen vote, and other election questions After the main event, ITV said it would hold a live interview-based programme to allow other parties to comment on the debate. The Conservatives, Labour, Liberal Democrats, Brexit Party, Scottish National Party and the Green Party will all be represented. In a later multi-party debate, the Conservatives, Labour, Lib Dems, SNP, Brexit Party and Plaid Cymru will take part, represented by either their leader or ""another senior figure"". ITV said Northern Ireland and Wales would have their own debates specifically for the nations, while STV - which broadcasts to parts of Scotland - plans to hold its own debate with Scottish candidates. The SNP said it should be included in the principal debate since it could very well hold the balance of power in a Hung Parliament. ""This debate ignores the half of the population who voted remain and want to see the UK stay in the EU and the majority in Scotland who support independence,"" said the party's Westminster leader Ian Blackford. ""UK politics has long stopped being a choice between two tired old parties."" And Lib Dem MP Chuka Umunna said the format was ""undemocratic and wrong"". Allow Twitter content?

"The government's MyTown campaign The government has been accused of using public funds to target voters in key general election constituencies with Facebook ads. The ads say: ""the Government is investing up to Â£25m"" in the town where the message appears on Facebook feeds. They went live on Tuesday - the same day Boris Johnson secured support for an early general election. Labour MP Ian Lucas called it an ""outrageous"" misuse of public funds,according to The Huffington Post.,external The seventeen adverts are part of the government's ""MyTown"" campaign on Facebook. Government pauses Â£100m Brexit ad campaign How does Stronger Towns Fund compare with EU funding? Several of the towns, such as Northampton, Milton Keynes and Mansfield, are home to constituencies that will be key battlegrounds in the general election, with majorities of less than 2,000. The campaign promotes the government's Â£3.6bn Towns Fund, which aims to increase investment in neglected parts of the country. The Facebook ads used for the government's MyTown campaign The ads, paid for by taxpayers, are not marked as being about ""social issues, elections or politics"". This is the system that Facebook has put in place to help with the transparency of social and political ads on its platforms. Other adverts by the UK government, such as the ""Get Ready for Brexit"" campaign, are flagged in this way. Not flagging them also means they disappear from the Facebook Ad Library once they are no longer active - and that it is not possible to find out how much the government has spent on them. Two of the ads have now been taken down after Facebook determined they were ""about social issues, elections or politics"" and required the disclaimer. Facebook's policies around political advertisinghave come under scrutinyin recent days asTwitter announced it would ban all paid political messages. By the BBC's Paul Sargeant Facebook has about 40 million users in the UK and most of the content people see on site is from their friends or pages they have liked. Anyone can also pay to have content shown to people who haven't liked their page - and they can chose who sees this paid-for content by targeting things like gender, age, location, or interests. Political parties also use this paid-for content to reach new people. The difference is Facebook ask that any content about ""about social issues, elections or politics"" is labelled by the organisation posting it. This political content is archived and can be searched for in the Facebook Ad Library. Meaning for every political advert it's possible to check who paid for it and get a rough idea of who has been shown the ad and how many times it has been seen. However, the system of labelling political adverts is voluntary. If an organisation fails to label their paid-for content, the adverts are only searchable while they are active on the site. This loophole could allow political organisations to hide old adverts or at least make them much harder to find. Mr Lucas has written a letter to Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove demanding to know how data for the campaign was gathered and accusing the government using public money for political purposes. ""It is quite clear that those constituencies are, largely, politically contentious. ""These marginal constituencies appear to have been selected on a political basis,"" his letter said. He told the Huffington Post: ""It is an example of how the government is merging political activity with the arms of government in its own political interest."" Labour's Shadow Communities Secretary Andrew Gwynne said the proposed cash injection was a ""drop in the ocean compared to the billions the Conservatives have cut from local communities"". A government spokesman told the BBC that ministers would respond to Mr Lucas' letter, but added: ""These posts were published before the election was called and Parliament has not yet been dissolved. ""All towns selected were chosen according to the same selection methodology, including analysis of deprivation, exposure to Brexit, productivity, economy resilience and investment opportunities."" The government has been the biggest UK spender on Facebook political adverts in the last month. The most recent figures available on Facebook's ad library site cover spending between 22 and 28 October and show that the government spent Â£192,753 in that period. All of the spending was on ads promoting the Get Ready for Brexit campaign. In second place was the People's Vote campaign for another EU referendum with spending of Â£52,234.

"Eight people were killed during the London Bridge attack in June 2017 The government should review how public spaces are assessed as possible terrorism targets in the wake of the London Bridge attack, the chief coroner for England and Wales has said. Eight people were killed in 2017 when three men drove into pedestrians on the bridge before stabbing others nearby. Judge Mark Lucraft said the system for triggering extra security measures was ""too rigid"". Families of the victims welcomed his ""extensive"" report. The chief coroner'sreport into preventing future deaths,externalalso called on the government to consider criminalising ""possession of the most serious material glorifying or encouraging terrorism"". He said the current law meant it might be impossible for police or MI5 to act even when ""the material is of the most offensive and shocking character"". Judge Lucraft made 18 recommendations in total. Could the London Bridge attack have been stopped? The partygoer who turned into a killer London Bridge 'not seen as high security risk' The attack began when Khuram Butt and two other men drove a rented van across London Bridge, striking pedestrians and killing the first two victims, Xavier Thomas and Christine Archibald. There were no barriers on the bridge preventing the van from mounting the pavement, despite some concerns among experts that it could become a target. After the attack, barriers were installed. In his formal report, Judge Lucraft said: ""The national criteria for identifying sites which would receive proactive advice were apparently too rigid."" He also said the home secretary needed some form of regular review of the list of vulnerable sites. Public authorities such as councils may also need to be put under a legal duty to review open and crowded spaces to minimise the risks of a fatal attack. The hypothetical new law that would criminalise possession of terrorism material could make it illegal to have a copy of the video that was live-streamed by the far-right killer who shot dead 51 worshippers at a mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand. But other examples may be more difficult to explicitly list - not least because the government has struggled and failed to come up with a clear legal definition of extremism. Would a law be able to outlaw the mere watching of a sermon from a terror group leader, even if the lecture does not in itself encourage violence? The chief coroner says the answer may lie in how Parliament has successfully banned the possession of extreme pornography that depicts violence and abuse. In that case, the law carefully sets out the harm MPs want to prevent. The question is whether a similar exercise could target supporters of terrorism without undermining legitimate free speech and inquiry. The chief coroner also concluded that there was a significant gap in the law - highlighted by the fact that the ringleader Butt had a vast amount of extremist material on his phone but had not been charged with a crime. ""While there are offences of possessing a document likely to be useful to a person in committing an act of terrorism, and of disseminating terrorist publications, there is no offence of possessing terrorist or extremist propaganda material,"" he said. The Old Bailey inquest heard that, in the months and years before the attack, Butt had viewed propaganda for the Islamic State group, violent images and sermons from extremist preachers. Judge Lucraft suggested new laws could be introduced to tackle the prevalence of extremist material in the same way legislation has criminalised the most offensive pornography. The inquests heard that Butt had been investigated by MI5 as a ""subject of interest"" - meaning he was one of the 3,000 suspects the security service was most concerned about. The security service had been investigating Butt since 2015, but suspended its investigation on two occasions because of more pressing priorities. The latter suspension, for six weeks, concluded just a month before the attack. ""Although MI5 must be able to prioritise and divert resources at times of greatest demand, the suspension of priority investigations is a matter of legitimate public concern,"" concluded Judge Lucraft. He recommended that security services should consider whether to scale back rather than suspend work. He said the emergency services should be more flexible during a marauding terrorist attack about how they allow paramedics and ambulance staff into zones considered to be dangerous - and that some police officers should receive advanced medical training analogous to ""battlefield medicine"". He also called on ministers and industry to consider a means of instantly reporting the rental of a vehicle to the security services so that it can be checked against known suspects.

It's 10.07pm and the sun has gone down on a warm summer's night in London. Read the story in full here. Helen Boniface, from solicitors firm Hogan Lovells, who represented six families in the inquest, said: ""We are pleased the chief coroner has recognised the risks presented by hateful extremism and terrorist propaganda, possession of which must be taken seriously, and the ease by which large vehicles may be hired by terrorist suspects.

"One of the buses involved ended up on top of a garden wall A bus driver has died and 15 people have been injured in a crash involving two buses and a car. Kenneth Matcham, 60, died at the scene after a car and two single-decker buses collided in Orpington, in south-east London, on Thursday night. The 24-year-old driver of the car has been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous and drug driving. The Met Police said of those hurt, three people had serious injuries while the rest were minor. According to one witness, the crash  happened at the bottom of The Avenue at the junction of Park Avenue and Sevenoaks Road. The wreckage of the car involved in the crash was towed away from the scene The London Fire Brigade (LFB) sent 60 firefighters to the scene of the collision, which happened at about 22:15 GMT. ""Firefighters rescued several casualties from the buses and immediately undertook first aid, being joined by colleagues from London Ambulance Service,"" its assistant commissioner Graham Ellis said. Claire Mann, TfL's director of bus operations, offered the firm's condolences and sympathies to Mr Matcham's family and confirmed they were working with the bus operator GoAhead and the Met Police to ""ensure we find out what happened"". Counselling has also been made available to those affected by the crash, she said. GoAhead tweeted that it was raising money,externalon a crowdfunding website to support Mr Matcham's family. The crash happened in Orpington at about 22:15 GMT One witness, who did not wish to be named, said he was in his living room when ""we literally heard a loud bang"". ""It didn't sound like a car crash, it was a really weird noise,"" he said. ""I went out to take a look and saw the carnage. My son is 11 and he was really upset. We didn't really want to stay outside as it was too upsetting really."" He said one of the buses had gone into a front garden. ""My heart goes out to those involved. Very distressing,"" he added. The GoAhead single-decker bus was lifted by crane on to a tow truck Another resident, Tariq Sheik, said he heard ""an awful lot of ambulance and fire engine noises last night"" and thought it might have been connected to Halloween. ""Horrific scenes, it's not very pleasant,"" he added. Road closures are in place around the area and police have advised motorists to use alternative routes. Six bus routes have also been diverted. Detectives have appealed for any witnesses or anyone with dashcam, mobile phone or CCTV footage of the collision to contact them.

"Protesters outside Asda's Leeds headquarters Asda staff have spoken of being ""terrified"" of losing their jobs after the supermarket giant put pressure on them to sign new contracts. Runcorn store employee Cath Sutton, who has yet to sign, said Asda should be ashamed of the stress it is causing. The contracts mean unpaid breaks, changes to night shift payments and being called to work at shorter notice. But as the Saturday deadline neared, Asda softened its stance, saying it did not want staff to leave and regret it. ""Once the closing date has passed, we will write to them again, offering them the opportunity to sign up,"" said the letter from chief executive Roger Burnley. The letter added: ""We do not want anyone to leave because of the new contract."" Fewer than 1,000 staff have yet to sign the new contract and its terms bring the company into line with rivals, Asda says. Most of the 100,000 staff affected will be better off, the letter added. The GMB union said many staff felt they could not sign the ""inflexible"" terms because of disruption to domestic life, while the impact would fall heavily on female employees. ""If I sign it, it will affect me because they can move me into any department,"" Ms Sutton, 76, who has worked for Asda for 45 years, told the Today programme. ""They can move me on to the shop floor, carrying heavy boxes, filling the shelves."" Cath Sutton cut the ribbon to re-open Runcorn's Asda store in June after an overhaul ""They could change my hours any time from five in the morning to 12 at night."" ""I think at my age, why would I be able to start going to different departments and doing different jobs?"" There are plenty of Asda workers who are similarly worried, she says, but are feeling pressured into agreeing the new terms. ""I think the company should be thoroughly, thoroughly ashamed of themselves. It's caused a hell of a lot of stress for people."" ""They are having to sign out of desperation because they are terrified of losing their jobs."" Under the changes, paid breaks will be scrapped, working bank holidays will become compulsory - although festive holidays will be voluntary and paid at double time - and there will be changes to night shift payments. Neil Derrick, GMB regional officer for Yorkshire and North Derbyshire, said staff would also be forced to attend work at shorter notice, disrupting the life of carers or people doing the school run. Leeds-based Asda is increasing hourly pay rates. However, Mr Derrick said it was not the money that mattered for many staff, but the inflexibility of the new working patterns. ""Many staff cannot sign because of upheaval to their domestic life. Others have signed just to get them through Christmas or until they can find new jobs,"" he said. ""I've not met anyone who thinks they will be better off in terms of working life. There will be a disproportionate impact on women."" Mr Derrick said the union would support sacked employees in any legal battle against Asda. Labour's leader Jeremy Corbyn has said he ""stands in solidarity"" with Asda workers. This week, Asda announced it would increase employees' basic hourly pay from April, a move that the GMB said shows the supermarket is desperate to woo over disgruntled staff before the deadline. The supermarket said it would raise its basic rate for its hourly-paid retail employees to Â£9.18 from 1 April next year, following an increase to Â£9 from 3 November. In London, which has an additional allowance to reflect the higher cost of living, basic pay will increase to Â£10.31 per hour. The retailer, owned by Walmart, acknowledged this week's annual pay announcement for April rises had come earlier that usual. An Asda spokesman said the new contract ""represents an investment of over Â£80m and an increase in real pay for over 100,000 of our hourly paid colleagues"". He added: ""We have been clear that we don't want any of our colleagues to leave us and whilst the vast majority of colleagues have chosen to sign the new contract, we continue to have conversations with those who have chosen not to, to try and understand their concerns."" While Asda accepted that change was ""never easy"", it was important that the company adapted to changes in the market and competition, he said. The company has won backing from former Sainsbury's chief executive Justin King, who used to work at Asda. He told the BBC that the new retail environment, where the working practices of some online retailers were ""almost Victorian"", had made life extremely competitive for traditional firms. ""All legacy retailers - and Asda are one - have some legacy arrangements with their workforce which simply don't reflect the modern world that we're in. ""Many online retailers don't pay their workers anywhere near as well as the mainstream retailers,"" he said. To compete, it was necessary to take tough decisions. ""Sometimes you have to do the right thing for the whole business.""

"It is the first time tourists have been allowed inside the cave since the rescue last year Tourists have entered Thailand's Tham Luang cave for the first time since the dramatic rescue last year of 12 boys and their football coach. Some 2,000 visitors flocked to the cave on Friday,external, hoping to be among the first to enter, the Bangkok Post reports. The Wild Boars youth team caught the world's attention when they got trapped in the flooded cave for 17 days. They were all eventually freed in an international rescue effort that involved more than 90 divers. The cave in Thailand's northern Chiang Rai province was officially opened to tourists in an inauguration ceremony on Friday. Jongklai Worapongsathork, the deputy director-general of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation, led the ceremony, which was attended by monks, government officials and park rangers.

People queued to enter the cave as it opened to the public on Friday More than a million people have visited the cave in the past year, but they have not been allowed to go inside. The team, aged between 11 and 16, and their 25-year-old coach became trapped on 23 June 2018 while exploring the cave complex, when a downpour flooded the tunnels.

On Friday, police confirmed they had spoken to Ronan Hughes by phone, but added that they needed to speak to the brothers in person. ""Ronan and Christopher, hand yourselves in,"" said Det Ch Insp Daniel Stoten, who is leading the lorry deaths investigation for Essex Police. ""We need you both to come forward and assist this investigation."" ""The sooner we can make this happen, the sooner we can progress with our investigation,"" he said. Police have also said that ""at this time"" it believes ""the victims are Vietnamese nationals"", and that they are in contact with the Vietnamese government. ""We are in direct contact with a number of families in Vietnam and the UK, and we believe we have identified families for some of the victims whose journey ended in tragedy on our shores,"" Assistant Chief Constable Tim Smith of Essex Police said. ""The confirmatory evidence needed to formally present cases to HM Senior Coroner for her consideration has not yet been obtained."" Eamonn Harrison was arrested in Dublin on a European Arrest Warrant Mr Stoten, who is leading the lorry deaths investigation for Essex Police, said the Hughes brothers have links to Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. They are also connected to the road haulage and shipping industries. Essex Police have said the brothers are from County Armagh but it is understood they are originally from County Monaghan in the Republic of Ireland. They have at least one business address in Northern Ireland. The PSNI stopped and seized a lorry on Thursday, believed to be connected to the Hughes brothers. No further arrests were made. This video can not be played Christopher (left) and Ronan Hughes are wanted by police, says Det Ch Insp Daniel Stoten The driver of the lorry in which the bodies were found, Maurice Robinson, appeared in court in Chelmsford on Monday. The 25-year-old, of Laurel Drive, Craigavon, is charged with a string of offences, including 39 counts of manslaughter. Prosecutors alleged that Mr Robinson was part ofa ""global ring"" of people smugglers. He was remanded in custody and is due to appear again at the Old Bailey in London later this month. Police stopped a lorry on Thursday, believed to be connected to the Hughes brothers All eight women and 31 men are thought to have been adults except one ""young adult"" woman who, police previously said may have been a teenager. Police initially believed the victims to be Chinese nationals but their efforts to identify them are now focusing on the Vietnamese community. VietHome, a popular Vietnamese community forum in the UK, said it had passed on the pictures of almost 20 people who have been reported missing to detectives. On Friday, the police in Vietnam's Ha Tinh province said that they have charged two unnamed people with ""organising or brokering illegal immigration"". They said the arrests were made after 10 local families reported their children - who were on their way to the UK - missing. Many of the families who have reported missing relatives know the names of the brokers who organised their journeys, says the BBC's Jonathan Head in Hanoi. Some are said to be local people familiar to communities which have a tradition of sending people overseas to work. British law enforcement officers have been working with Vietnamese authorities in an attempt to suppress human trafficking over the past number of years, adds our correspondent. Sources in Hanoi say there has been some progress, but people smuggling is still hugely lucrative and thriving in Vietnam. The Vietnamese embassy in London has set up a contact line for people to get in touch. GPS data shows the refrigerated container trailer in which the bodies were found crossed back and forth between the UK and continental Europe in the days before it was found. It was leased from the company Global Trailer Rentals on 15 October. The company said it was ""entirely unaware that the trailer was to be used in the manner in which it appears to have been"". It is not the lorry police seized on 31 October in Northern Ireland. Sources say the GPS data shows it left Monaghan in the Republic of Ireland on 15 October before crossing over to Northern Ireland and then returning south to Dublin From Dublin, it crossed over to Holyhead in Wales overnight on 16 October That evening, it travelled to continental Europe from Dover to Calais in France Between 17 and 22 October, it moved between various cities in Belgium and France, including Dunkirk, Bruges and Lille On 22 October, it made its final crossing from Zeebrugge to Purfleet Essex Police said the tractor unit (the front part of the lorry) had entered the UK via Holyhead - an Irish Sea port in Wales - on 20 October, having travelled over from Dublin. Police believe the tractor unit collected the trailer in Purfleet on the River Thames and left the port shortly after 01:05 on 23 October. Police were called to the industrial park where the bodies were discovered about half an hour later. Temperatures in refrigerated units can be as low as -25C (-13F). The lorry now is at a secure site in Essex. Early reports had suggested the lorry may have arrived from Bulgaria but its government has since clarified that while the tractor unit was registered there in 2017 it had not entered the country since. This article was based on public announcements and appeals made by Essex Police at the relevant time. Christopher Hughes denies any involvement in these offences and Essex Police has since confirmed no further action will be taken against him. Since the publication of this article, his older brother, Ronan Hughes, 41, and Maurice Robinson, 26, both of County Armagh, have pleaded guilty to manslaughter.

"A man convicted of raping and killing a British embassy worker in Lebanon has been sentenced to death, the country's state news agency, NNA, reports. Uber driver Tariq Houshieh confessed to murdering Rebecca Dykes, whose body was found by the roadside in December 2017. The 30-year-old had been strangled with a rope. Lebanese judges routinely call for death sentences in murder cases, but no executions have been carried out since 2004. The British embassy in Beirut saidMs Dykes was ""much loved and is deeply missed"",external, describing her as ""a talented, devoted humanitarian, whose skill, expertise and passion improved the lives of many people"". The embassy said it hoped the court's decision would provide ""a degree of closure"" for those close to Ms Dykes, but added that the UK government continued to oppose the death penalty ""in all circumstances"". Ms Dykes had been working for the Department for International Development since January 2017, helping Lebanon to cope with the influx of refugees from the war in neighbouring Syria. She had reportedly been due to fly home to the UK for Christmas. Uber driver held over Lebanon death Family 'devastated' by Briton's killing But she was abducted after leaving a bar in the popular Gemmayzeh district of Beirut where she went for a colleague's leaving party. Her body was found close to a motorway on the outskirts of the city. Police traced Houshieh's car on traffic management CCTV and he was arrested days after the killing. He had previously served several prison sentences, a senior Lebanese security source told the BBC at the time of his arrest. A candlelit vigil was held for Ms Dykes outside Beirut's National Museum Her family set up the Rebecca Dykes Foundation, which aims to continue her work to improve the lives of refugees in Lebanon. In a statement after her death, they said she was ""irreplaceable"". The University of Manchester also posthumously awarded her an Outstanding Alumni award in July 2019, saying that her work led to Syrian and Palestinian refugee communities ""becoming more peaceful"". Death sentences are legal in Lebanon but an unofficial moratorium means that none has been carried out for 15 years The country brieflyresumed executions in 2004,external, executing two convicted murderers by firing squad and one by hanging Although international and local activists have called for it to be abolished, the death penalty continues to have public and political support, according toa report by Lebanese human rights watchdog ALEF,external In 2018, there were 82 people in prison who had been sentenced to death, a study found Before her posting in Beirut, Ms Dykes worked for the Foreign Office as a policy manager for its Libya team and as an Iraq research analyst. She graduated with a degree in social anthropology at the University of Manchester in 2005, and also had a master's in international security and global governance from Birkbeck, University of London. A former pupil of Malvern Girls' College and Rugby School, she had also taught English at a Chinese international school. On social media, she said she was originally from London.

"Fitness device marker Fitbit is being bought by Google for $2.1bn (Â£1.6bn). The move allows Google to expand into the market for fitness trackers and smart watches. It comes at a time when loss-making Fitbit has been looking to expand into other areas. ""Google is an ideal partner to advance our mission,"" said James Park, co-founder and chief executive of Fitbit. The bid values Fitbit at $7.35 a share, a premium of about 19% to the stock's closing price on Thursday. ""With Google's resources and global platform, Fitbit will be able to accelerate innovation in the wearables category, scale faster and make health even more accessible to everyone,"" said Mr Park, who founded Fitbit 12 years ago. The company, one of the first sellers of tech-enabled fitness trackers, was valued at more than $4bn at the time of its flotation in 2015. It has sold more than 100 million devices, but has struggled with waning demand for its products as other companies enter the market. It put itself up for sale last month. Its shares have jumped 40% since Monday, when Reuters reported the interest from Google. James Park founded Fitbit 12 years ago The transaction is expected to be completed in 2020, pending approval by the board and regulators. Regulators in the US and abroad have been taking a closer look at acquisitions by the tech giants, amid growing concerns about monopoly power. Fitbit said its ""health and wellness"" data would not be used for Google adverts and pledged to maintain strong privacy protections. But analysts said the health data was key the deal. ""The deep health and fitness data, coupled with the 28 million active users on the Fitbit platform, offer a tremendous value,"" Craig Hallum analysts wrote in a note cited by Reuters. Analysis by Dave Lee, BBC North America technology reporter Here's a deal that makes perfect sense for Google. While $2.1bn is a pretty hefty premium given Fitbit's market value was around the $1.4bn-mark last week, it's small change when considered against the bigger picture of gaining a huge amount of health data. For Fitbit, it's a noble exit after putting up a decent fight in the years since the launch of Apple's smartwatch. A Fitbit-Google product could mean Wear OS - Google's wearable operating system - will get a much-needed boost. I do wonder, though, how Fitbit's 28 million users will feel about this. Anecdotally, I know several people who have told me that Fitbit's relative autonomy from the tech giants was an incentive to buy their products (though Fitbit has used Google's cloud to support its service since 2018). By next year, the health data Fitbit has on its users today will become Google's data - a valuable acquisition for Google, undoubtedly, but one that I predict could make consumers uncomfortable.

"Nigel Farage says he wants to form a ""leave electoral alliance"" with the Conservatives Launching the Brexit Party's campaign, he urges Boris Johnson to drop his EU deal If the Tories reject his offer of a ""non-aggression pact"", he says his party will stand in every British seat The Tories say a vote for the Brexit Party will let Jeremy Corbyn into Downing Street Nicola Sturgeon says a vote for the SNP is a vote to end the ""Brexit horror show"" The UK will go to the polls for a general election on 12 December Mary O'Connor, Matt Cannon and Becky Morton If you've not had a chance to follow our live blog today, here's a quick round-up of what has happened: Political leaders continued setting out the key messages of their election campaigns ahead of the formal closure of Parliament next Wednesday. Among them was Nigel Farage, who launched the Brexit Party's campaign in Westminster. In his speech, the party leader called for the Conservativesto build a ""leave alliance"" with his partywith the aim of achieving a majority in Parliament. He called on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to drop his Brexit deal or face Brexit Party candidates in every seat. But a Tory source later dismissed the possibility of the party working with him, saying voting for Mr Farage ""risks letting Jeremy Corbyn into Downing Street"". Also on the campaign trail was Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland's First Minister and leader of the SNP, who visited Edinburgh North and Leith, a three-way marginal seat. After President Donald Trump'sradio interview with Mr Farage yesterday, the issue of whether US firms could have access to the NHS under a post-Brexit US-UK trade deal has been a key feature of today's campaigning. You can read BBC health editor Hugh Pym's piece on ""Could the NHS be up for sale?""here. Elsewhere, the government was accused ofusing public funds to target votersin key general election constituencies in with Facebook ads. That's it for our live page today, but you can continue to follow our political coverageon the BBC News channel, and read the main stories of the dayon the BBC News website. Heidi Allen swapped the Tory party for Change UK, before joining the Liberal Democrats A group of equal rights campaigners has called for social media companies to do more to tackle online abuse aimed at female MPs. The Centenary Action Group - whose members include the Jo Cox Foundation - has also called for ""meaningful sanctions"" to tackle allegations of harassment in political parties. It comes after two female MPs - cabinet minister Nicky Morgan and Lib Dem MP Heidi Allen - cited online abuse of MPs when announcing that they were standing down. The group said: ""While women have won the right to vote, our right to participate in public life free from violence, harassment, abuse and all other forms of discrimination continues to be threatened. ""At the next election we risk going backwards on womenâs representation."" Read about why women MPs are quitting politics here. John Bercow is demanding an apology from the Daily Mirror over claims he asked for Â£1m to appear on I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here! The outgoing Commons Speaker accuses the paper of ""publishing lies despite being advised of the truth"" and has complained to the press watchdog. The Mirror claimed talks between Mr Bercow and ITV broke down over the size of his appearance fee. Mr Bercow, who retired on Thursday after 10 years in the Speaker's chair, is understood to be furious about the story. Read More The Brexit Party faces a ""tall order"" to fight every seat at the election, says BBC political correspondent Helen Catt. Mr Farage told reporters earlier that his party would field a candidate in every constituency in England, Scotland and Wales - unless the Conservatives agreed a ""non-aggression"" pact with his party. ""That'll leave the Brexit Party needing to find somewhere in the region of 630 candidates,"" Helen says. ""Nigel Farage says he's got about 500 signed up, which will go forward on Monday. ""But it's quite a tall order for a party that of course is very new and has only been in existence for about six months."" Mr Farage earlier said that the party would have enough money to do so, thanks to donations on the party's website. Hugh PymBBC News Health Editor If the early exchanges are anything to go by, health will feature prominently in this election campaign. Labour has for some time argued that the NHS is vulnerable to privatisation under the Conservatives. The party has developed a new attack line, that any post-Brexit trade deal with the US will open the door to big American health corporations. It has also picked up on suggestions that the US authorities will demand that the NHS pays more for drugs supplied by American companies. In essence, Labour is alleging that the NHS is not safe after a Brexit presided over by the Tories. The Conservatives have strongly denied that the NHS is in any way ""up for sale"". They argue that there will be red lines with the British position in any trade talks, which protect the current status of the health service and the drug purchasing regime. Read more Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage has called on the prime minister to drop his Brexit deal in exchange for an election pact. The Conservatives have consistently ruled out a formal pact with the party. But individual voters can still vote tactically - for example by backing a candidate they wouldn't normally support, to stop someone else winning. This could happen in a constituency where two parties are in a tight race and candidates from other parties trail far behind. In these circumstances, a supporter of the candidate who was a distant third, might pick their favourite of the two who are in with a chance. Read our guide to find out more about how tactical voting works. A former Labour MSP has switched allegiance to the SNP, the Scottish party has announced. Anne McTaggart quit Labour, saying that she supported independence for Scotland and that she wanted ""to be part of something positive"". SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said on twitter it was ""great to welcome"" her. The Times deputy political editor tweets... It looks like Mr Farage might have to follow through on his threat to field candidates in every seat in England, Scotland and Wales. Allow Twitter content?

The BBC has analysed the political parties' activities on Facebook and Instagram today. Labourhas increased its
advertising slightly since yesterday, with a new set focused on
fundraising. The ads are highlighting the difference in donations between
Labour and the Conservatives, and each talks about the âTories' billionaire donorsâ
or just âbillionairesâ. The Lib Demshave begun a new
push on the ""stop Brexit"" campaign video they launched earlier this week.
This time itâs being promoted with a simpler message: âIf you want to stop
Brexit, be a Liberal Democrat voter.â Previously, the message above the video
was: âThe Liberal Democrats are the biggest, strongest party of Remain.â The Conservativeshave only just begun putting out paid-for advertising. But so far they only have two active adverts. Both are specifically about Milton Keynes, and we can assume they are only being
seen by people in Milton Keynes. Plaid Cymruhave launched some new
fundraising adverts with the line: âWales, itâs us. Donate.â (âNi yw Cymru.
Cyfrannwch.â) Meanwhile, neither theSNPand theGreen Partyhave any active adverts on Facebook. This video can not be played Nigel Farage tells Johnson to 'drop the deal' Nigel Farage launched the Brexit Party's election campaign earlier with an attack on Boris Johnson's Brexit deal. Mr Farage offered the Conservative Party a ""non-aggression"" pact with his own Brexit Party in order for the UK to leave the EU. However, Mr Farage also repeatedly criticised Mr Johnson's agreement and called on the prime minister to drop it ""because it's not Brexit"". Chancellor Sajid Javid criticises a Spectator columnist after he suggested planning elections for a time when Muslims can't vote. In an article,externalheadlined, ""If you do one thing this election, stop your kids voting"", Rod Liddle wrote: ""My own choice of election date would be a day when universities are closed and Muslims are forbidden to do anything on pain of hell, or something. ""There must be at least one day like that in the Muslim calendar, surely? That would deliver at least 40 seats to the Tories, I reckon."" Mr Javid, who is of Muslim heritage, tweets that Mr Liddle's comments are ""not funny and not acceptable"": Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Responding to the criticism, Mr Liddle says his words had been taken ""out of context"". Writing on the Spectator website,external, he says: ""There was no hate speech or Islamophobia whatsoever in my piece. ""They were very obviously ludicrous suggestions, satirical in manner, about how to reduce the Labour vote by targeting groups which traditionally vote Labour and occasioned by the wrangling over whether the election should be on December 9 or 12 and the reasons for that wrangling."" Tory Brexiteer Steve Baker says it is ""completely inconceivable"" the Tories will make a pact with the Brexit Party. The chairman of the pro-Brexit European Research Group tells the PA news agency he will not abandon his support for the prime minister's deal to avoid a challenge from Nigel Farage's party. ""The reason every Conservative Eurosceptic MP
backed the deal is that it can deliver a Brexit worth having,"" he says. ""But Boris will only negotiate a great future for
the UK if he has a good majority of resolute Conservative MPs."" ""Nigel now risks that and our future."" The World at OneBBC Radio 4 Brexiteer Conservative MP Mark Francois says Nigel Farage has ""screwed up"" his bid for a non-aggression pact between the Brexit Party and the Tories. He tells BBC Radio 4's World At One: ""If you genuinely want to work with another political party (to form a Leave alliance), you don't go on live national television and call them liars."" He adds: ""If that was meant to be an olive branch - Nigel completely cocked it up."" The Brexit Party leader is a ""very talented politician"", he says, but his ""ego got the better of him"" when launching his party's election campaign earlier. Mr Francois defends Boris Johnson's Brexit deal, saying that he and fellow Eurosceptic Tory MPs would not have voted for it if they thought it kept the UK in the EU. And he also rejects Mr Farage's prediction that there are Tory MPs who regret voting for the deal. ""I don't think he's going to bully any Tory MP into doing what they don't want to do,"" he adds. Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent Nigel
Farage has, in effect, given Boris Johnson an ultimatum; abandon your central
Brexit policy or the Brexit Party will challenge your deal at every
opportunity across the country. With the prime minister highly likely to
refuse, it seems Mr Farage will have to live up to his promise of fielding 500
or more candidates in this election by Monday - and his claim that he has the
resources to do so. Thatâs a tall order for a party only launched in April. He's no doubt buoyed by the Brexit Party's success in the European Elections
earlier this year. But in the past, when at the helm of UKIP, Mr Farage has
struggled to turn popular support into Westminster seats. He has been targeting
Labour leave areas in Wales, the Midlands and the North of England; the very
seats Mr Johnson has in his sights. The risk for both parties is by splitting
the Leave vote they give Jeremy Corbyn an unintended boost. The World at OneBBC Radio 4 Polling expert Sir John Curtice says it is ""unlikely"" that the Brexit Party standing in the election would do more harm to Labour than to the Conservatives. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's World At One, he says opinion polls suggest that most of the Brexit Party's support comes from former Tory voters. He says: ""If you look at those constituencies that the Conservatives want to pick up - the 50 most marginal Labour seats - they are disproportionately Leave seats. ""And they are places where UKIP did well in 2015. ""The odds are that these are therefore places where the Brexit Party can be expected to do particularly well."" Meanwhile, he says that attempts to convince Remain voters to vote tactically against the Conservatives reflects ""the fact that the Remain vote is split"". He adds that in constituencies which voted to leave the EU, the majority of Labour voters backed Remain. ""So even there Labour's problem is the Liberal Democrats, not necessarily Nigel Farage,"" he says. BBC political correspondent tweets... Allow Twitter content?

"Cairney and Jones spent 20 years pretending that Ms Fleming was still alive The couple jailed for the murder of Margaret Fleming have been urged to reveal what they did with her body. Police issued a direct appeal to Edward Cairney and Avril Jones on what would have been Margaret's 39th birthday. The vulnerable teenager was under their care in Inverkip, on the Clyde coast, when she vanished in 1999. But Jones continued to claim Â£182,000 in benefits until it finally emerged Margaret was missing in October 2016. The teenager who was forgotten for 17 years The day I interviewed Margaret's killers How do you solve a murder without a body? Cairney, 77, and Jones, 59, were ordered to serve a minimum of 14 years afterthey were convicted at the High Court in Glasgow earlier this year. Four months on Det Supt Paul Livingstone, the officer who led the investigation, has issued a fresh appeal to the killers. He said: ""I would like to appeal directly to Edward Cairney and Avril Jones, on what would have been Margaret's 39th birthday. ""If you have a shred of decency, you will answer the questions Margaret's family have to allow them to put her to rest."" Margaret Fleming's body has never been found Det Supt Livingstone has lodged formal requests with Cairney and Jones' lawyers asking for information and has reiterated a previous offer for a face-to-face meeting. He added: ""Margaret was a very vulnerable young woman when she was abused, neglected, manipulated and murdered. It's only right that her family and friends get the opportunity to pay their final respects."" The senior officer also stressed the fact there has been convictions does not mean police would not act on any new information. Det Supt Livingstone said: "" It's very important that she is given the funeral she deserves and for her family to be able to pay their respects to her. ""I would say again to Eddie Cairney and Avril Jones - your lies have caught up with you, so now do the decent thing and let Margaret's family know what has happened to her."" Det Supt Paul Livingstone led the Margaret Fleming murder investigation Margaret had been living with the couple for about two years when she disappeared. During this time detectives said they subjected her to a ""living hell"". But despite a painstaking search of their dilapidated property and its garden and an exhaustive proof of life investigation no trace of her has ever been found. Testimony from Avril's brother, Richard Jones, was used to pinpoint the last independent sighting of the teenager on 17 December, 1999. Three weeks later, on 5 January, 2000, Avril told her mother, Florence Jones, Margaret had run off with a traveller. A major search of the Seacroft cottage in Inverkip, Inverkip was carried out by police Cairney and Jones, who had no previous convictions, then embarked on a cover up which involved bogus letters and erasing all trace of Margaret from their home. Police Scotland launched a missing persons' investigation after social work raised the alarm in October 2016. The couple were both convicted of murder but only Jones was found guilty of benefit fraud as the teenager's money was paid directly into her account. Despite no evidence to the contrary they maintained Margaret was still alive and often returned to visit them.

"Seven dispersal zones will be operating in Edinburgh over the weekend in an attempt to combat anti-social behaviour and disorder over the bonfire period. The zones will run between 14:00 and midnight until Tuesday 5 November. They cover Muirhouse, Portobello, Loganlea, West Pilton, Saughton, Gorgie and Moredun. It means police can instruct groups of two or more people who are congregating and behaving in an anti-social manner to disperse. They will be arrested if they return within 24 hours if they do not live there. It is thesecond that year dispersal zoneswill be used in the city over bonfire weekend. Police at the dispersal zone in Pilton last year Ch Insp Murray Starkey, of Police Scotland, said: ""As we witnessed last year, the use of dispersal zones enabled police to robustly tackle anti-social behaviour and general disorder in key areas of the city, allowing us to move on people who are causing a nuisance.

"The result of the 2019 general election could determine whether Brexit happens or not. Some parties have withdrawn candidates to help their rivals. Meanwhile, campaign groups are encouraging people to use tactical-voting websites, to help them decide which candidate to support. So, what are election pacts and tactical voting - and how does each work? Parties and candidates themselves sometimes make tactical decisions. This generally means one party agreeing not to stand candidates in certain areas, so that another party with similar views on key issues has a stronger change of winning. The aim is to stop the vote splitting, which could help rivals with very different views from taking the seat. In Canterbury,Liberal Democrat candidate Tim Walker has stood downbecause he feared dividing the Remain vote. He said he was concerned standing would allow the Conservative candidate to take the seat from Labour. And the Brexit Party has announcedit will not contest the 317 seats won by the Conservatives in 2017.This is so as not to split the pro-Brexit vote in those areas. Instead, it says it will concentrate its efforts on taking seats from Labour, whom it suggested had ""betrayed"" its Leave-supporting voters. The Green Party hasstood down its candidatein Chingford and Woodford Green, to help Labour try to unseat former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith. Separately, anti-Brexit parties Plaid Cymru, the Liberal Democrats and the Greenshave agreed an electoral pact in 11 of the 40 seats in Wales. The aim is to get as many Remain-supporting MPs elected as possible. Back in August,the Lib Dems beat the Conservatives in the Brecon and Radnorshire by-election, after Plaid Cymru and the Greens agreed not to stand. Labourhas ruled out forming pacts with other parties. Put simply, tactical voting is when any of the UK's voters chooses to back a candidate they wouldn't normally support. This is done in the hope of stopping another candidate winning. This could happen in a constituency where two parties are in a tight race and candidates from other parties trail far behind. In these circumstances, a supporter of the candidate who was a distant third, might pick their favourite of the two who are in with a chance. At this election, campaigners say voting tactically could help MPs who share voters' views on Brexit win more seats.

The UK uses a first-past-the-post voting system, sometimes described as ""winner takes all"". It means the local candidate who receives the most votes becomes an MP - and the party with the most winning candidates nationally normally forms a government. Coming a good second does not help a party win any more power in Parliament. Tactical voting is perfectly legal in the UK.

More news explainers This election is going to be highly unpredictable, researchers atthe British Election Study,externalsay. That's because voters could be more likely to switch their support, largely because of the uncertainty over Brexit. Last month, the Electoral Reform Society campaign group asked polling company BMG Research to find out how widespread tactical voting might be. Of 1,500 voters questioned,24% said they planned to vote tactically to keep out a candidate they dislike,external. That compares with 66% who said they would vote for their first preference - regardless of how likely they were to win. The remaining 10% said they didn't know. When the same question was asked before the 2017 general election, 20% of people said they planned to vote tactically. Tactical voting has been a very powerful tool in the past, says Stephen Fisher, professor of political sociology at the University of Oxford.

"A total of 208 women MPs were elected in the last election With another election just over a month away, parties are busy selecting their candidates for seats up and down the country. Most sides have made pledges to make their candidates more representative, including bringing more women into the race. However, with the deadline for selections less than a week away on 14 November, the parties' record in selecting women is mixed - with Labour picking more women, while the Conservatives choose more men. Women MPs say abuse forcing them from politics Which MPs are standing down at the election? Could snow delay the vote? For many decades after women were first legally allowed to stand for election, female MPs made up less than 5% of the total. This reached double digits for the first time under Margaret Thatcher in 1987, but shot up to 18% after Tony Blair's 1997 landslide, with 120 women elected. Edward Heath alongside his female MPs in 1970 One in three MPs in the 2017 vote were women - 208 in total, up from 191 in 2015. But there were significant variation between parties, with 45% of Labour MPs being women compared with just 21% for the Conservatives. Since the last general election, Parliament has seen five by-elections after two women and three men resigned from Parliament. But all five winning candidates were female - bringing the total in the House to 211. Each political party has a different process for selecting or adopting candidates. But preliminary research by the BBC suggests the parties have had varying success in selecting sufficient female candidates to reflect the population of the country. So far, the Conservatives have selected proportionally fewer women candidates in the seats they are most likely to win than the other parties, while Labour has selected the most women. The pattern holds both in seats where MPs are retiring and in target seats - the constituencies that require the smallest swings to change hands. There are still some seats where the candidates haven't yet been chosen, but the parties have completed the selection process in most of the top targets. So far, 72 MPs have said publicly they will not stand at the forthcoming election and 20 are women - approximately the proportion of the total number of female MPs. Traditionally, political parties have attempted to fill vacancies created through retiring MPs by shoehorning in their favourite sons. But times have changed. Politicians understand by encouraging the adoption of women candidates in these ""retirement"" seats - many of whom will inherit strong majorities and are seen as relatively safe - the parties can boost their number of female MPs and edge towards gender balance. The selections in such prized ""safe"" seats remains ongoing, but at the time of writing, significantly more female candidates had been selected than the number of incumbent female MPs who are leaving the Commons. All this means that if the swingometer remained frozen on election night and no seats changed hands there would be 16 additional women MPs. The BBC has also looked at the top 50 target seats - listed by swing required - for the three main UK parties, and the 24 target seats for the SNP in Scotland. Once again, the selections process is still ongoing, but from the data analysed so far, there are similar variations: Whatever the outcome of the election though, don't expect equal numbers of men and women in the next Parliament.

"The boy was taken to hospital from the scene in High Road, Tottenham, but he died from his injuries A toddler has died after falling from a block of flats in Tottenham, north London. The child, aged about 18 months, fell from Stellar House, just off Tottenham High Road, on Thursday morning. He was taken to hospital by paramedics where he was pronounced dead an hour later. Haringey Council, which manages the block of flats, said a ""full investigation"" would be carried out. Meral Dervik, a neighbour in Stellar House, claimed the toddler's mother had been complaining to the council about a faulty handle, although the authority has not commented on the claim. She said: ""The window, it was faulty. Nearly two months, that was what [the mother] was saying. ""She was calling the council to come to fix it. The handle was not secure."" Ms Dervik said the boy's mother was ""shocked and upset"", and added: ""She was looking after the kids brilliantly, she cared about the children."" Stellar House is located near to Tottenham Hotspur's new stadium Formal identification and a post-mortem examination will take place in due course. The Metropolitan Police has launched an investigation and is treating the death as unexplained. Declining to comment on the issue of faulty windows at the block, the council issued a statement from its chief executive Zina Etheridge that said their ""deepest sympathies"" were with the family. ""We can confirm that the block is managed by Homes for Haringey, who are carrying out a full investigation into the circumstances,"" she said. ""The police are currently investigating and it would be inappropriate for us to comment further, or speculate, until more is known about this very sad incident."" The London Ambulance Service said it was called at 10:46 GMT and ""sent a number of resources"" to the scene near Langhedge Lane. London's Air Ambulance was also dispatched.

"This video can not be played Father of autistic child urges government action to stop 'horrific' detentions ""They placed her in a seclusion cell and they left her there for two years, alone, 24/7, horrific."" Jeremy says he could only touch his 15-year-old daughter Bethany by kneeling down and reaching into her isolation room through a tiny hatch. Bethany is severely autistic but had no therapeutic care while detained in hospital, Jeremy told the BBC. Now MPs and peers say such treatment of young people with learning disabilities or autism breaches their human rights. The Joint Committee on Human Rights says mental health hospitals can inflict ""terrible suffering on those detained... causing anguish to their distraught families"". Its report,externalurges an overhaul of mental health law and hospital inspections in England. ""It must not be allowed to continue,"" said Harriet Harman, who chairs the committee. Bethany's story, BBC File on 4 The failings in learning disability services in six charts 'She was so desperate, she swallowed a toothbrush' After a campaign by her parents, Bethany was briefly sent to an adolescent unit in Staffordshire which did ""brilliant work"", according to her dad. ""She was out in the community. She wasn't locked away. We could take the pet dogs, go for a walk in the grounds. It was brilliant."" But once she turned 18, she could no longer stay in an adolescent unit so she was transferred but not to a similar unit with similar support, says her dad. ""They placed her in an adult medium secure unit that doesn't even specialise in autism."" Bethany's form of autism means she experiences extreme anxiety and, without proper care, can be hard to manage, he told the Victoria Derbyshire programme. He says she has ""deteriorated massively. It's horrendous, She's in a cell again"". ""I had a hatch before that I could hold her hand through. I don't even have that now. I can't hold my daughter."" By law, young people with learning disabilities or autism detained in mental health hospitals must have treatment that is necessary, appropriate and available. But the inquiry, launched in January, heard evidence of ""a significant increase in distress and a worsening of symptoms for those detained, particularly where segregation and restraint have been used"". ""We are concerned that a very broad approach has been taken to the 'appropriate medical treatment' requirement... and the approach appears to be that the most basic provision of care satisfies this test,"" the committee says. ""We consider the human rights of many of those with a learning disability and/or autism are being breached in mental health hospitals."" One young man told the inquiry: ""I did not know what was happening. ""Looking back at it now, it does not feel real. It feels like some sort of nightmare. ""It was not a safe place. It was not a treatment room. I got no assessment or treatment done. ""There was no care. I was just put in this room and I lay there and went to sleep."" Another had his arm broken in a restraint, according to his mother. ""His arm was wrenched up behind his back until the bone snapped. He was not then taken to accident and emergency for 24 hours even though his arm was completely swollen,"" she said. Another mother said her son had been kept in isolation for up to nine hours at a time. ""The rule was that he could not leave until he was quiet,"" she told the inquiry. ""With his anxiety and sensory presentation, there was no way this was possible. ""He started to bang his head against the wall and would bite the wood in the doorframe out of desperation."" Too often, families are excluded from decision-making and when they try to intervene are viewed as hostile and a problem, which is unacceptable, the report says. Families must be recognised as ""human-rights defenders"", it says. The committee says it has ""lost confidence that the system is doing what it says it is doing"", while the regulator, which should be a ""bulwark"" against abuses, is failing and in urgent need of reform. ""Too often it is left to the media to be human rights defenders,"" the report says,highlighting work by the BBC's Panorama programme in uncovering abuse of patients by staff at Whorlton Hall mental-health hospital. The MPs and peers also say they have no confidence government targets to reduce the number of people with learning disabilities or autism in mental-health hospitals will be met. They demand: a special No 10 unit to safeguard the human rights of young people with learning disabilities and autism an overhaul of inspections, to include covert surveillance and unannounced visits at night and weekends only individuals who will benefit from treatment are detained in mental hospital families are fully involved in decisions ""This inquiry has shown with stark clarity the urgent change that is needed and we've set out simple proposals for exactly that,"" Ms Harman said. ""They must be driven forward urgently."" Ian Trenholm, chief executive of the Care Quality Commission, which regulates health and social care services in England, said many of the report's recommendations relating to the watchdog were already under way, ""although we are clear there is much still to be done"". Mr Trenholm said an independent review of the CQC's regulation of mental health hospitals had been commissioned and the findings would be used to strengthen this work. ""We know we need to improve how we regulate mental health, learning disability and/or autism services so we can get better at spotting poor care and at using the information people give us,"" he said. ""We are working hard to improve and we want to involve people, families, carers and stakeholder organisations to ensure we get it right.""

"This video can not be played Donald Trump criticises Boris Johnson's Brexit deal The government has defended the UK's Brexit deal with the EU, following criticism from the US president. Donald Trump said the US ""can't make a trade deal with the UK"" under Boris Johnson's EU withdrawal agreement. A Number 10 spokesman said Boris Johnson had not spoken to Mr Trump about his Brexit deal, which was ""agreed after they were last in touch"". Other comments made by Mr Trump led Labour to accuse him of trying to ""interfere"" in the election. Speaking to LBC,external, the president said Mr Corbyn would be ""so bad"" as prime minister and that Mr Johnson was ""the exact right guy for the times"". Mr Corbyn accused him of ""trying to interfere"" in the UK general election to boost ""his friend Boris Johnson"". The UK is going to the polls on 12 December following a further delay to the UK's departure from the EU, to 31 January 2020. LIVE: Latest as political parties prepare for election What is in Boris Johnson's new Brexit deal? First head-to-head TV election debate announced Mr Johnson hopes to win a majority of seats so that he can get his deal through Parliament - while Mr Corbyn promises another referendum if he wins the keys to 10 Downing Street. But Mr Trump said his longstanding ally Mr Farage - leader of the Brexit Party - should team up with Boris Johnson to do ""something terrific"", saying they would be ""an unstoppable force"" in the December poll. Mr Farage's party is due to hold its campaign launch later amid speculation about whether they will field MPs in every seat or stand down candidates to help Tory Brexiteers win. Speaking on LBC this morning, Mr Farage said his view was there needed to be ""some kind of alliance"" - but he would not comment on whether the Brexit Party would be fielding ""20 or 200 candidates"". This video can not be played Donald Trump met Boris Johnson in September and said he was ""doing very well"" In August, Mr Trumppromised a ""very big trade deal""with the UK and predicted that leaving the EU would be like losing ""an anchor round the ankle"". But speaking to supporter Nigel Farage on LBC, Mr Trump was critical of the withdrawal agreement Mr Johnson recently reached with EU leaders. Mr Trump said: ""We want to do trade with UK and they want to do trade with us."" But he added: ""To be honest with you... this deal... under certain aspects of the [Brexit] deal... you can't do it, you can't trade. Could the NHS be ""up for sale"" to US companies? Jeremy Corbyn vows to 'transform' UK ""We can't make a trade deal with the UK because I think we can do many times the numbers that we're doing right now and certainly much bigger numbers than you are doing under the European Union."" Mr Trump, who has previously expressed his backing for Brexit, did not elaborate on what difficulties he thought might arise in striking a US-UK trade deal. A Number 10 spokesman said: ""The PM's deal takes back control of our money, laws and border and allows us to do trade deals with any country we chose - including the US."" And Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick said the PM's plan was a ""good deal"" that allows the UK to ""strike free trade deals around the world"". Asked if the president's assessment was wrong, Mr Jenrick told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We know the deal enables us to secure deals with a range of growing economies [and] we'll be setting out to do that."" He also claimed initial conversations with the US about a trade deal had been ""positive"". Analysis by Andrew Walker, BBC Economics Correspondent President Trump pointed to ""certain aspects"" of Boris Johnson's deal which he said would prevent a trade deal deal with the US. But he didn't go into any more detail, so it's hard to work out what his problem is with the agreement. Broadly though, Boris Johnson's deal would take the UK out of the EU customs union, allowing the country to determine its own tariffs (taxes on imports). It would be possible for the UK to offer tariff-free trade agreements with other countries, including the US, something that would not have been possible under the previous deal negotiated by Theresa May's government. Trade deals are not just about tariffs. They can also tackle regulatory barriers to trade, such as food standards. The longer-term relationship with the EU, after the transition period in Mr Johnson's agreement, is to be negotiated. The more closely we follow EU rules, the less scope we would have to offer access to products that wouldn't be allowed into the EU such as the infamous chlorinated chicken. So that future deal with the EU might impose restrictions on what we can offer other countries that President Trump would find unacceptable. But for the current government the freedom to diverge from EU rules is an important benefit of Brexit, so it is possible that we could end up able to offer President Trump much of what he wants. Mr Corbyn has said a post-Brexit trade deal with Mr Trump's administration would give US companies greater access to the NHS, and allow them to profit from it at UK taxpayers' expense. Shadow international trade secretary Barry Gardiner told Today the NHS was ""clearly in the negotiating mandate"" and ""it is clearly something which [Mr Trump] in the past has said is absolutely on the table"". However, the president dismissed the Labour leader's claim, saying: ""Not at all. We wouldn't even be involved in that, no. It's not for us to have anything to do with your health care system. No, we're just talking about trade."" The UK government has said that, under any future trade deal with the US, it wants protections for the NHS.

"On social media Michaella McCollum seems confident, even comfortable, in the spotlight - but in real life it seems a different story. The former drug mule appears fragile. The 26-year-old occupies a weird kind of semi-celebrity status. More than 28,000 people who follow her private Instagram account see snaps familiar to many aspiring influencers - a mix of pouting selfies, glam holiday shots and cute pictures of her one-year-old twins. But she's also often featured in the gossip pages of tabloid newspapers. Her smile is warm, if slightly nervous, and her voice is soft. She pushes her long blonde hair out of her eyes at regular intervals while we talk over video chat from her home in Northern Ireland, during her babies' nap time. The unease she's showing could be due to the fact McCollum is better known as one of thePeru Two- two women arrested trying to smuggle Â£1.5m worth of cocaine into Ibiza in 2013. Michaella McCollum (left) and her fellow drug mule, Melissa Reid (right), were arrested at Lima airport in August 2013 McCollum and the woman arrested with her, Melissa Reid, quickly became notorious. Pictures of the pair looking shell-shocked as customs officers arrested them in the middle of Lima's crowded airport were everywhere. People on social media debated whether they looked sorry for their crime, while wondering how two 20-year-olds go from partying in Ibiza to getting mixed up with an international drug smuggling ring. They looked so relatable, like anyone you might meet on a night out on holiday. They claimed that they were naive, but were convicted of drug smuggling and spent more than two years in a series of grim, cockroach-infested Peruvian prisons. McCollum was granted early release in 2016 and returned home, but her reputation followed her. As a convicted criminal, she says it's been hard to find work, make new friends and have relationships. McCollum is back home now after serving almost three years in prison in Peru She feels ""like everyone is judging her"" and claims her experience has left her with ""trust issues"". Her fellow prisoner Reid has kept a comparatively low profile, but McCollum has now written a book about her experiences. She says the title, You'll Never See Daylight Again, was based on a threat made to her while she was in jail. There were signs from the start that going to Ibiza was a bad idea, McCollum tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. ""I didn't know much about the island. I was having problems at home and just wanted to escape, but didn't know where to. I'd worked in bars before and did like partying, so when I saw people on Facebook saying they were going there I got the idea. I thought I'd have a really good summer."" She bought a one-way ticket. It was her first time leaving the UK and her mum and sisters - she's one of 10 - came to see her the day before she left, ""crying hysterically"". ""I was like, 'Why are you being so dramatic?'. ""They told me afterwards they had a feeling that something was going to happen, that I wasn't supposed to go there,"" she says. On the day of her flight McCollum forgot her passport and was running late. Once she got to the airport she realised she didn't have her boarding pass and was fined by the airline. Then her hand luggage was too heavy, and she was fined again. ""I just thought it was bad luck,"" she says. McCollum (left) grew up as one of 10 siblings in a close family The way she tells it, McCollum was running away from her life in Northern Ireland. In the book she describes growing up amongst gambling, drugs, death threats against her Catholic family and an abusive boyfriend. McCollum claims although she wanted these more personal details cut out of the book, fearing they would make her ""more vulnerable"", she was persuaded it would help people ""connect with the person she was at the time"". But this isn't a bid to make people feel sympathy for her, she says. ""It was never put in there for me to play the victim. It's just to give people the whole image of who I was. Obviously, everybody can have an opinion of me going to Ibiza and Peru but I'd gone through some things in life that had led me to that point. ""If I hadn't got involved in drugs at a young age I definitely wouldn't have gone to Ibiza - or continued taking drugs, or got myself in that situation."" A dreadful decision McCollum says she was at a party and high on acid, the psychedelic drug LSD, when a new friend asked her to ""go on a trip"" to ""pick up a package"" in Barcelona. She writes now that it was the ""worst decision of my life"" and says her thinking was confused at the time. She knew she didn't want to go back to Northern Ireland and the Â£5,000 they were offering seemed like a ticket to a new life. She tells Newsbeat that she assumed she would be transporting drugs, but had no idea of the scale of the operation she would become part of. It all happened pretty quickly after that. In the book, she recalls a drug-fuelled pit stop for breakfast at McDonald's, writing that: ""Of everything I've done, everything that I regret, sniffing Class A drugs off a table in McDonald's is up there. But that's hindsight for you."" Before she'd had time to fully sober-up she found herself boarding a plane to Mallorca. The plan had changed - she was no longer going to Barcelona, her final destination was now Peru, with a few days stopover on the neighbouring Balearic island. Once in Mallorca, she was introduced to Reid and the pair spent several days at a house filled with guns and strangers who booked their onwards flights to Lima - Peru's capital - where it was planned they would pick up the drugs. ""I didn't really know where Peru was but I didn't think it was in South America. I'd never heard of it before. Because I was first told I was going to Barcelona and then Mallorca, I thought that Peru was going to be somewhere in Spain too. I know it's so stupid but I just really didn't know. I hadn't travelled."" McCollum says she ""asks herself all the time"" why she didn't walk away from the drug deal The truth about her destination finally dawned when, concerned about how long the flight was taking, she asked the man in the seat next to her for information about their destination. It was at that moment she says her ""heart dropped"". She'd watched enough movies to know that South America was associated with serious drug crime. When they arrived and she saw the level of security and military presence at the airport she started really ""freaking out"". Colombia's battle with cocaine traffickers Who takes cocaine? Drugs 'principal driver of violence' 'Young people behind' record levels of Class A drug use So, why didn't she try to escape? After all, it was only her and Reid alone in Peru, pretending to be tourists together, for several days. ""It's something I ask myself all the time,"" says McCollum. It's true that their Spanish contacts had taken their personal mobiles and told them they were being watched, but they had no interactions with anyone else until the drugs were delivered to their hotel on the last night. It was only then - when she saw the amount they were meant to bring back - that reality started to sink in, she claims. ""When I saw how much drugs there were I started getting more scared because I realised this was a really, really big thing. Until then, I thought I was just taking back something small - which is still a big deal - but there were about 38 packages in total. It was a real shock. ""I was scared and thought 'I just want to get it over with and get back home'. I don't know what would have happened if I had just walked away, maybe nothing. But I wish I had listened to my gut and walked away."" She didn't. Instead, along with Reid, she packed her suitcase with 11kg of cocaine hidden in cereal packets and, after an anxious night, headed for the check-in queue at Lima airport. It wasn't long before they were surrounded by sniffer dogs and police who escorted them into a side room. Once the test on the drugs in Reid's case came back positive, their fate was sealed. ""The whole room erupted,"" McCollum recalls. ""Within minutes it was filled with 30 or 40 people. That's when I realised it was over. I just felt numb, I didn't move or say much. I still couldn't believe it was me in that situation."" It's clear McCollum doesn't find it easy reliving these experiences. She often looks on the brink of tears during our conversation. ""We were like deer caught in the headlights,"" she says quietly. Both her and Reid then endured a ""really, really horrible search"" and were chained to metal chairs for 24 hours wondering what lay in store for them. The pair, whose personalities had clashed up to this point, found themselves suddenly bonded by their shared nightmare. ""I started thinking about my family for the first time and I looked at Melissa, and we both started sobbingâ¦ I just felt so stupid and sad."" McCollum and Reid pleaded guilty to trying to smuggle 11kg of cocaine Her first phone call with her mum is something she'd rather forget. ""It was awful,"" she says. A few days had passed since her arrest and at this point her family were making desperate appeals for information on social media, believing she was missing. ""When I called and said 'Hello', my mum knew it was me. She started shouting and screaming and all my family members came on the phone - everybody was really happy. I was trying to talk but mum was too busy. When I finally said, 'I'm in jail' she didn't really understand and the call cut off before I could explain. So, it wasn't until the next day when it was in the papers that she found out I'd been arrested for drugs."" Sat in court handcuffed together in December 2013, McCollum and Reid were jailed for six years after pleading guilty to drug trafficking. The next two years and eight months of McCollum's life were spent in a series of Peruvian prisons, where the bed was a concrete slab, food was often riddled with bugs and you could find a knife aimed at your head for trying to change the TV channel. Looking back, she's grateful to have got through it without being beaten up or ""touched"". McCollum learnt Spanish while serving time and it's clear she has tried to turn her life around. Now, she lives at home with her mum and her twin sons, and recently took and passed three A-levels. She hopes a degree in business is next. She's still friends with Reid, although they don't see each other - which she puts down to living in different countries. ""We'll always have a bond,"" McCollum says, admitting that at times they only had each other. ""I'm really grateful that she was there. She helped me through some difficult times - she understood everything because she was going through it too."" McCollum is a now a mum to twin baby boys As much as McCollum is trying to put her past behind her, there will be some who say that she's cashing in on her crime by putting her story back in the spotlight. So, why tell it now? It's not about the money, she insists - although any profits from the book will go directly to her. Since returning to the UK, McCollum says she's had ""several"" approaches to do different TV shows. ""I could have made a lot of money doing that if I was money-orientated,"" she says, adding that press attention has made it hard for her to ""return to her life and get a job"". Instead, her argument is that she wants people to stop judging her and to draw a line under that chapter in her life. She also talks about wanting to bring awareness to the consequences of things like drug smuggling. The book ends on a positive note with McCollum, who says she hasn't touched drugs since that time in Mallorca, writing that now ""everything is exactly as it should be"". But speaking to her it's clear that she's still struggling to come to terms with what she did - and that those experiences and her reputation are likely to haunt her for the rest of her life. ""It's hard to talk about it because it's still very emotional for me. It's something I want to overcome and let go of. I want to deal with the emotions that I bottled up. I'm hoping through this process that I'll be able to heal."" In the UK,drug trafficking,externalClass A drugs like cocaine carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment (25 years).

"The result of the 2019 general election could determine whether Brexit happens or not. Some parties have withdrawn candidates to help their rivals. Meanwhile, campaign groups are encouraging people to use tactical-voting websites, to help them decide which candidate to support. So, what are election pacts and tactical voting - and how does each work? Parties and candidates themselves sometimes make tactical decisions. This generally means one party agreeing not to stand candidates in certain areas, so that another party with similar views on key issues has a stronger change of winning. The aim is to stop the vote splitting, which could help rivals with very different views from taking the seat. In Canterbury,Liberal Democrat candidate Tim Walker has stood downbecause he feared dividing the Remain vote. He said he was concerned standing would allow the Conservative candidate to take the seat from Labour. And the Brexit Party has announcedit will not contest the 317 seats won by the Conservatives in 2017.This is so as not to split the pro-Brexit vote in those areas. Instead, it says it will concentrate its efforts on taking seats from Labour, whom it suggested had ""betrayed"" its Leave-supporting voters. The Green Party hasstood down its candidatein Chingford and Woodford Green, to help Labour try to unseat former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith. Separately, anti-Brexit parties Plaid Cymru, the Liberal Democrats and the Greenshave agreed an electoral pact in 11 of the 40 seats in Wales. The aim is to get as many Remain-supporting MPs elected as possible. Back in August,the Lib Dems beat the Conservatives in the Brecon and Radnorshire by-election, after Plaid Cymru and the Greens agreed not to stand. Labourhas ruled out forming pacts with other parties. Put simply, tactical voting is when any of the UK's voters chooses to back a candidate they wouldn't normally support. This is done in the hope of stopping another candidate winning. This could happen in a constituency where two parties are in a tight race and candidates from other parties trail far behind. In these circumstances, a supporter of the candidate who was a distant third, might pick their favourite of the two who are in with a chance. At this election, campaigners say voting tactically could help MPs who share voters' views on Brexit win more seats.

"The starting gun has been fired, the election campaign is under way and the future of the NHS has dominated the opening lap of the contest.  If the early exchanges are anything to go by, health will feature prominently in the campaign. Labour has for some time argued that the NHS is vulnerable to privatisation under the Conservatives. The party has developed a new attack line, that any post-Brexit trade deal with the United States will open the door to big American health corporations.  It has also picked up on suggestions that the US authorities will demand that the NHS pays more for drugs supplied by American companies. In essence, Labour is alleging that the NHS is not safe after a Brexit presided over by the Tories. The Conservatives have strongly denied that the NHS is in any way ""up for sale"".  They argue that there will be red lines with the British position in any trade talks, which protect the current status of the health service and the drug purchasing regime. Fuelling this row was adocumentary by Channel 4 Dispatches,externalwhich asserted that the price the NHS pays for US medicines could rise steeply in any future trade deal with the United States. The programme reported that ""drug pricing"" had been discussed in six initial meetings between trade officials from the UK and the US and that there had been ""secret meetings"" between the pharmaceutical companies and British civil servants. In response to the programme, the government said: ""We could not agree to any proposals on medicines pricing or access that would put NHS finances at risk or reduce clinician and patient choice."" President Trump has made no secret of his frustration that US drug corporations can in many cases charge American health providers more for their products than what the NHS pays. This is because the US health system is market-based, and insurers are more ready to pay the asking price. Could US companies run NHS services after Brexit? US firms seek changes to UK standards on beef and drugs Reality Check: Does UK spend half as much on health as US? Is Trump right that US drug prices have fallen? The NHS in England relies on the advice of the medical cost watchdog NICE, on what offers the best benefits for patients balanced against value for money. Wales and Northern Ireland tend to follow NICE rulings, while Scotland has its own equivalent, the SMC. The NICE regime, introduced 20 years ago, is seen as a great success in helping the NHS strike realistic pricing deals. A recent deal for the cystic fibrosis drug Orkambi was hailed by health leaders in England as a big win for the system, with the American manufacturer Vertex, having initially refused to bring down its price, eventually signing up. The Scottish Government had already done its own deal. The NHS has immense bargaining power because of its size and its centralised control over drug availability is always attractive to pharmaceutical companies who are keen to be part of that market. So the suggestion in some quarters is that the American negotiators will demand that higher prices are paid to US pharmaceutical companies, potentially adding damaging extra costs to the already stretched NHS budget. The response by the Conservatives is that no British government would knowingly agree to something which added billions of pounds to public spending. So what about private provision in the NHS? There is evidence that the number of contracts awarded to private organisations by NHS commissioners has increased. But these have tended to be for smaller service deals, and a more rounded picture is gained by looking at the overall spending numbers. The proportion of government health spending in England going to private providers has risen by more than three-quarters in the last decade and now stands at 7.3%, according to official figures for 2018/19. But that rate has remained little changed for the last few years. Labour says this is evidence of creeping gains made by the private sector winning NHS  contracts. The Conservative response is that private provision also rose rapidly under the last Labour government, which outsourced some routine surgery to private hospitals. Current rules allow American and other foreign firms to bid for NHS contracts if they have a European subsidiary. The US company United Health owns Optum, for example, which provides IT and research services to some NHS organisations. It is conceivable that in any trade talks, US negotiators would demand a more streamlined bidding process to open up access.  It should be noted, however, that the head of NHS England, Simon Stevens, has called for an end to any competitive tendering. When Mr Trump visited the UK in June, he said the NHSwould form part of negotiations over a possible future trade deal between the UK and US. The next day,he rowed back from those remarks. When asked in his radio interview with LBC, whether the NHS would feature in trade talks, President Trump said: ""We wouldn't even be involved in that, no. It's not for us to have anything to do with your health care system."" The Conservatives argue that it simply would not be on the table. But it is impossible to be certain at this stage what precisely would or would not be in the mix when the negotiators get to work after Brexit.

"This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""Whose side are you on?"" At first glance, Labour's campaign launch appeared like a replay of its 2017 election launch. Back then, Jeremy Corbyn attacked vested interests - and pledged that his party would be battling for the many not the few. Businessman Mike Ashley has had the honour - if that's the word - of featuring in Labour's rogues' gallery of ""bad bosses"" in both the 2017 general election campaign launch and again today. But the tone, if anything, is more strident now. Channelling the left-wing folk singer Pete Seeger, the Labour leader repeatedly - and rhetorically - asked his audience whose side they were on. He made it clear his party was against ""dodgy landlords"", big polluters, tax dodgers, rich media magnates. It looks like this will be something of an insurrectionary campaign. Corbyn launches Labour campaign to 'transform' UK Partly, this is to inoculate the party against the Conservative charge that it is siding with the political class against the people on Brexit - causing ""dither and delay"". So Jeremy Corbyn is trying to get his retaliation in first - by arguing it is Boris Johnson and Tories' financial backers who are really part of a privileged elite. But Labour's tone is a form of attack as well as defence. As in 2017, Labour is aiming to win over younger voters and those who rarely vote - and who need to be convinced that politics can make a difference. Hence the clear blue - or red - water between Labour and their opponents. Labour is hoping to focus voters' minds on non-Brexit issues And it's part of a wider strategy to try to appeal to potential Labour voters beyond the Brexit debate. Jeremy Corbyn for some time has argued that while working class voters may be divided on the EU, they can be united in support of better working conditions, fairer taxes, and more investment in public services. The strategy is to try almost to divorce Brexit from the other issues, arguing that can be settled further down the line in a referendum with a ""credible"" Leave option and Remain on the ballot. In Leave areas - where Labour is seriously worried about suffering losses - the hope is that however much the party's voters or ex-voters want Brexit done, they will prioritise other issues directly affecting their lives. So, Labour strategists believe it is essential on the wider non Brexit agenda to have as distinctive a message as possible. Now, some Labour MPs argue that - with circumstances rather different now than in 2017 -  Labour could have played this election differently. With an exodus of former Remainers from the Conservative ranks, technically the party could have blurred its more radical edge - don't forget, in 2017, the leadership claimed their manifesto's policies were in the tradition of mainstream European social democracy - and made a pitch for the centre ground, But that is unlikely to have passed the authenticity test with Jeremy Corbyn at the helm. Labour did better than many expected in 2017 And some in Labour's ranks have been saying privately that the uncompromising messaging and the forthcoming radical manifesto are designed to shore up, rather than greatly expand, the Labour contingent in Parliament. After all, the campaign launch was in Battersea - a marginal they hope to hold, rather than a seat they aspire to win. Policies that will motivate the party's foot soldiers will help in the defence of some seats won by very slim majorities last time round. And there are sophisticated methods being deployed by the left-wing group Momentum to move activists around to where they are most needed. There are, of course, different measures of what winning looks like. For Boris Johnson an overall majority is essential. If Labour, though, can become not outright winners but the largest party in a hung Parliament, it could very likely form a minority government with tacit support from the SNP and, possibly, the Liberal Democrats in order to deliver a new EU referendum. But, of course, Jeremy Corbyn insists he is fighting to win and that most opinion polls are probably as misleading now as they were two and a half years ago. And that even more now than then, middle as well as working-class voters do not feel, in their day-to-day lives, that austerity is over - whatever spending pledges are being made by the prime minister. So the potential reservoir of support could be greater than the current state of the polls suggest. But some challenges lie ahead for Labour - including how far the Brexit issue really can be contained within a ""cordon sanitaire"". And there remains a question - whatever the rhetoric - about just how radical Labour will be. Will a conference policy on abolishing private schools, and another on extending the free movement, really make it in to the manifesto? This is an election many Labour MPs didn't appear to want, with widespread abstentions in Tuesday evening's vote. But some of those closest to Jeremy Corbyn were champing at the bit for an election. They believe if Labour are currently being seen as also-rans, opponents will become complacent and in the end - however radical the party's message - progressive centre-left voters will be forced to back them if they want to stop Boris Johnson. In this election, though, there is no such thing as a sure thing.

Two years ago this month, hospital patients in Gurgaon were issued masks amid similar conditions ""I didn't realise how bad it would get,"" one resident said. ""Do we really want our kids to grow up in such an environment? No-one really cares, no-one wants to improve the situation.""

The thick smog also raised concerns for the weekend's cricket clash between India and Bangladesh. A 2017 match in similar polluted conditions led to Sri Lankan players vomiting on the pitch. But Bangladesh's coach said that despite ""scratchy eyes"" and sore throats among his players, the game would go ahead. Bangladesh head coach Russell Domingo (R) wore a mask to training, but said his players would get on with it ""No-one is dying,"" Russell Domingo told the Press Trust of India. ""Look, there's a bit of pollution in Bangladesh as well, so it's a not a massive shock unlike some other countries. The players have just got on with the game and haven't complained too much about it,"" he said. One of the main reasons for air quality in the city worsening every year in November and December is that farmers in the neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana burn crop stubble to clear their fields. It's made worse by the fireworks during the Hindu festival of Diwali. There are other reasons too, including construction dust, factory and vehicular emissions, but farm fires remain the biggest culprit. This video can not be played A hair-raising drive through the Delhi smog More than two million farmers burn 23 million tonnes of crop residue on some 80,000 sq km of farmland in northern India every winter. The stubble smoke is a lethal cocktail of particulate matter, carbon dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and sulphur dioxide. Using satellite data, Harvard University researchers estimated that nearly half of Delhi's air pollution between 2012 and 2016 was due to stubble burning. The burning is so widespread that it even shows up in satellite photos from Nasa. Particulate matter, or PM, 2.5 is a type of pollution involving fine particles less than 2.5 microns (0.0025mm) in diameter A second type, PM 10, is of coarser particles with a diameter of up to 10 microns Some occur naturally - e.g. from dust storms and forest fires, others from human industrial processes They often consist of fragments that are small enough to reach the lungs or, in the smallest cases, to cross into the bloodstream as well Hair-raising drive through Delhi smog.

"A protester in Malaga holds up a sign saying ""No means no"" in support of the Manresa victim A Barcelona court's decision to acquit five men accused of gang-raping a 14-year-old girl of the charge of sexual assault has provoked outrage. The court ruled out rape because the victim was in an ""unconscious state"" and the accused had not used violence or intimidation. This is a requirement under Spanish law for a charge of sexual assault, which is legally the equivalent of rape. Instead, they were convicted and jailed for the lesser crime of sexual abuse. The five were sentenced to between 10 and 12 years in prison. A conviction for sexual assault would have carried prison sentences of between 15 and 20 years. A review is currently taking place in Spain to decide whether to base rape cases on a woman's explicit consent to sex. A number of European countries have changed their laws in recent years to define rape as sex without consent. Sweden changed the law last year and Denmark is doing the same. The Barcelona verdict comes despitea ruling in a similar case by the Spanish Supreme Courtupgrading a conviction from sexual abuse to sexual assault. Barcelona's Mayor Ada Colau denounced it as an ""outrageous sentence"",externalon Twitter. ""I am not a judge and I do not know how many years in prison they deserve, what I do know is that it is not abuse, it is rape!"" Warning: Some readers may find details of this story disturbing Women's rights groups have similarly reacted to the ruling with anger and dismay. Furious social media users have been commenting on the case under hashtags like JusticiaPatriarcal (Patriarchal Justice) and NoEsAbusoEsViolacion (It's not abuse it's rape). The case is known as the ""Manada de Manresa"" - Manresa Wolf Pack - for its similarities toa 2016 gang attack on a teenagerwhich prompted widespread protests and an ongoing review of Spain's rape laws. Lila Corominas, a spokeswoman for the Manresa Feminist Strike Committee, told newspaper Nius Diario this was ""an obvious case of sexual assault and intimidation"". Leader of the MÃ¡s PaÃ­s political party ÃÃ±igo ErrejÃ³n said the sentence was ""shameful"", while Irene Montero, spokeswoman for Unidas Podemos, called for a change in the law ""so we can speak proudly of living in a feminist country"". Some activists are calling for a protest against the court decision,externalin Manresa on Saturday at 13:00 local time (12:00 GMT). The five men were found guilty of abusing the girl during a drinking session known in Spanish as a botellÃ³n at a disused factory in Manresa, a town in the north-eastern region of Catalonia, in October 2016. Prosecutors told the court the men - two Spaniards, two Cubans and one Argentine - took turns to attack the girl, who was under the influence of alcohol and drugs. One of the defendants, named only as Bryan AndrÃ©s M, was said to have told each of them: ""It's your turn. Fifteen minutes each and no delay."" At a previous court hearing, the girl said she remembered very little of what happened but that one of the men had been brandishing a gun. All the defendants denied the allegations, although the DNA of one of them was found on the girl's underwear. A similar case sparked fury in Spain, and was later overturned by the Supreme Court The court ruled that the victim did ""not know what she was and wasn't doing, and consequently, did not have the ability to agree to or oppose the sexual relations most of the defendants had with her"", El Pais reported. It added that the defendants ""were able to commit sexual acts without using any type of violence or intimidation"". The court eventually awarded the victim â¬12,000 (Â£10,300) damages for an attack it described as ""extremely severe and especially denigrating"". Judges expressed ""surprise"" that the prosecutors changed the charge at the last minute to sexual assault from the initial accusation of sexual abuse. They said they could not see the reasons for the more serious assault offence in the prosecution's arguments. A court in Navarra jailed five men for sexual abuse for a gang attack in Pamplona on an 18-year-old woman who was dragged into the hallway of a residential building. As she appeared ""passive or neutral"", according to a police report, the court decided no intimidation or violence had taken place. This video can not be played Activists say rage over the ""wolfpack"" case ignited a feminist revolution (Video from 2019) In June, the Spanish Supreme Court overturned that ruling, deciding it was sexual assault and that the men were rapists. The five saw their sentences of nine years increased to 15. Spain's prime minister last year appointed a panel to review the rape laws.

On Friday, police confirmed they had spoken to Ronan Hughes by phone, but added that they needed to speak to the brothers in person. ""Ronan and Christopher, hand yourselves in,"" said Det Ch Insp Daniel Stoten, who is leading the lorry deaths investigation for Essex Police. ""We need you both to come forward and assist this investigation."" ""The sooner we can make this happen, the sooner we can progress with our investigation,"" he said. Police have also said that ""at this time"" it believes ""the victims are Vietnamese nationals"", and that they are in contact with the Vietnamese government. ""We are in direct contact with a number of families in Vietnam and the UK, and we believe we have identified families for some of the victims whose journey ended in tragedy on our shores,"" Assistant Chief Constable Tim Smith of Essex Police said. ""The confirmatory evidence needed to formally present cases to HM Senior Coroner for her consideration has not yet been obtained."" Eamonn Harrison was arrested in Dublin on a European Arrest Warrant Mr Stoten, who is leading the lorry deaths investigation for Essex Police, said the Hughes brothers have links to Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. They are also connected to the road haulage and shipping industries. Essex Police have said the brothers are from County Armagh but it is understood they are originally from County Monaghan in the Republic of Ireland. They have at least one business address in Northern Ireland. The PSNI stopped and seized a lorry on Thursday, believed to be connected to the Hughes brothers. No further arrests were made. This video can not be played Christopher (left) and Ronan Hughes are wanted by police, says Det Ch Insp Daniel Stoten The driver of the lorry in which the bodies were found, Maurice Robinson, appeared in court in Chelmsford on Monday. The 25-year-old, of Laurel Drive, Craigavon, is charged with a string of offences, including 39 counts of manslaughter. Prosecutors alleged that Mr Robinson was part ofa ""global ring"" of people smugglers. He was remanded in custody and is due to appear again at the Old Bailey in London later this month. Police stopped a lorry on Thursday, believed to be connected to the Hughes brothers All eight women and 31 men are thought to have been adults except one ""young adult"" woman who, police previously said may have been a teenager. Police initially believed the victims to be Chinese nationals but their efforts to identify them are now focusing on the Vietnamese community. VietHome, a popular Vietnamese community forum in the UK, said it had passed on the pictures of almost 20 people who have been reported missing to detectives. On Friday, the police in Vietnam's Ha Tinh province said that they have charged two unnamed people with ""organising or brokering illegal immigration"". They said the arrests were made after 10 local families reported their children - who were on their way to the UK - missing. Many of the families who have reported missing relatives know the names of the brokers who organised their journeys, says the BBC's Jonathan Head in Hanoi. Some are said to be local people familiar to communities which have a tradition of sending people overseas to work. British law enforcement officers have been working with Vietnamese authorities in an attempt to suppress human trafficking over the past number of years, adds our correspondent. Sources in Hanoi say there has been some progress, but people smuggling is still hugely lucrative and thriving in Vietnam. The Vietnamese embassy in London has set up a contact line for people to get in touch. GPS data shows the refrigerated container trailer in which the bodies were found crossed back and forth between the UK and continental Europe in the days before it was found. It was leased from the company Global Trailer Rentals on 15 October. The company said it was ""entirely unaware that the trailer was to be used in the manner in which it appears to have been"". It is not the lorry police seized on 31 October in Northern Ireland. Sources say the GPS data shows it left Monaghan in the Republic of Ireland on 15 October before crossing over to Northern Ireland and then returning south to Dublin From Dublin, it crossed over to Holyhead in Wales overnight on 16 October That evening, it travelled to continental Europe from Dover to Calais in France Between 17 and 22 October, it moved between various cities in Belgium and France, including Dunkirk, Bruges and Lille On 22 October, it made its final crossing from Zeebrugge to Purfleet Essex Police said the tractor unit (the front part of the lorry) had entered the UK via Holyhead - an Irish Sea port in Wales - on 20 October, having travelled over from Dublin. Police believe the tractor unit collected the trailer in Purfleet on the River Thames and left the port shortly after 01:05 on 23 October. Police were called to the industrial park where the bodies were discovered about half an hour later. Temperatures in refrigerated units can be as low as -25C (-13F). The lorry now is at a secure site in Essex. Early reports had suggested the lorry may have arrived from Bulgaria but its government has since clarified that while the tractor unit was registered there in 2017 it had not entered the country since. This article was based on public announcements and appeals made by Essex Police at the relevant time. Christopher Hughes denies any involvement in these offences and Essex Police has since confirmed no further action will be taken against him. Since the publication of this article, his older brother, Ronan Hughes, 41, and Maurice Robinson, 26, both of County Armagh, have pleaded guilty to manslaughter.

"Britain's countryside will be transformed by policies to combat climate change, the government's former chief environment scientist says. Professor Sir Ian Boyd said climate policies after Brexit will alter the landscape more than most people expect. There will be many more trees and hedges but far fewer grazing animals as people eat less red meat, he said. The farmers' union, the NFU, rejected his analysis and forecast that there may be more grazing animals, not fewer. It said the UK's well-watered pastures are ideal for producing low-carbon livestock and exporting it to places where growing conditions are less favourable. This is the first public eruption of a long-running conflict between Professor Boyd, the former adviser to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) and the body that represents Britain's farmers. Sir Ian thinks the NFU has wielded far too much influence over departmental policy. The NFU believes he is out of touch with the reality of farming. The antipathy reflects deeper technical, ethical and political debates over the future of the production and consumption of animals for food. UK farms plan for going 'carbon neutral' Five ways farmers are tackling climate change Sir Ian says the UK needs to reduce the amount of red meat it produces and eats if it is to meetthe Net Zero emissions target,externalby 2050. He told BBC News: ""What I see is a farming system that's very inefficient and in need of very significant transformation. ""I see a significant part of that coming from the way we farm and consume livestock. ""If we want to move towards Net Zero in the UK, changing our approach to red meat consumption is an essential part of that."" He points out that under international agreements, greenhouse gas emissions are measured in the country where they are created. That means China gets blamed for the CO2 it generates whilst making goods exported to the UK. By the same token, the UK's responsible for emissions from its belching sheep - whether they're eaten in Britain or Brazil. Sir Ian says this system of carbon accounting is most unlikely to change. Sir Ian says it's actually more carbon-efficient to raise sheep and cattle on intensive high-tech farms than on traditional extensive pastures. That's because although intensive farming with animals fed on grains and soya creates more CO2 emissions, it creates fewer methane emissions. Research proves,,externalhe says, that because intensively-raised animals grow and mature quicker, they are slaughtered younger - so they belch less methane in their shorter lives. As methane is a far more powerful greenhouse gas than CO2 in the medium term, that means intensively-farmed livestock are less bad for the climate. Sir Ian said: ""All the evidence tells us that intensive farming done well is much more environmentally friendly than extensive farming. ""Intensive farming is able to apply much more modern technology. And changes (to farming) will lead to significant reduction in the amount of land farmed directly for food."" The NFU takes exactly the opposite stance. Its president Minette Batters says the carbon accounting system that measures CO2 and methane is too narrowly focused. She maintains that intensive farming doesn't take full responsibility for its other environmental impacts. These includehuge water consumptionin drought-prone areas like California, or Brazilian rainforestsbeing felled to grow soyato feed cows. Ms Batters says the world should be queuing up to buy red meat produced on the soggy fields of Britain, Ireland and New Zealand. She told BBC News: ""If anything, I think the number of sheep and cows will go up in the UK - to make us less reliant on chemical fertiliser (which produces greenhouse gases)."" She also forecast that British sheep and cows would be bred and reared to reach slaughter much more quickly in order to reduce methane burps. ""The argument about methane is badly flawed. We can 'finish' an animal just as quickly (as intensive farming)â¦ under 15 months using right genetics and using the right breed."" And as the representative of a cross-section of the UK's farmers - including those who raise livestock - she can't accept it's inevitable that people in Britain will eat less meat, either. Her union is now producing its own ambitious plan for Net Zero emissions agriculture by 2040, and that will put pasture-raised meat centre stage. It will make the point that grasslands can't be used for any economically useful purpose other than grazing. Well, a succession of expert reports warn that rich nations are consumingtoo much red meatfor the health of people and the planet - that's whether farmers like the message or not. But Sir Ian's analysis of the environmental impact of livestock is questioned by Professor Pete Smith from Aberdeen University, a lead author for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. He told BBC News the livestock industry should be judged in the round - not just on its climate change emissions. He said: ""If you just look at the issue through climate blinkers you'd do the opposite of what many might want to see. This video can not be played Gases produced by livestock are a major factor in global warming, so should we change our eating habits? ""By halving the time it takes to get an animal to slaughter weight (through intensive farming) you can halve its belching and halve its methane emissions. ""But that system is arguably much worse for animal welfare, landscape, water usage, and food imports."" He concludes: ""It's better for many reasons to produce cattle in a pasture grazing system in the UK than in an area needing water and causing land degradation (like Brazil or the USA)."" Prof Smith bears unwelcome news for UK farmers, though. He warns: ""Current ruminant (sheep and cattle) land in the UK is not economic. Many farmers can't survive without subsidies. ""What's more, the emissions from those animals occur within our national boundaries. So we won't hit UK emissions targets without reducing the size of the livestock herd."" Thecurrent EU system,externalpays farmers grants according to the amount of land they own. The government plans to shift farm subsidies towards what it calls ""public money for public goods"". That includes things that benefit the public but don't get accounted for by the market. So public goods includes improving the landscape, helping drainage, and storing carbon in the soil, in trees and also in pasture land, but not producing food because that's paid by the market. Ms Batters says dung from grazing animals can often increase the amount of carbon captured in soils depleted by over-intensive farming. One system, known a mob grazing, involves sheep or cattle being shifted around from field to field munching grass for a short period of time. Pioneer farmers who've adopted the practice say it's improving the carbon content of their soils. But experts warn that pastures can become saturated with carbon so they're not able to take any more. Prof Smith said: ""There are some good schemes for grazing - but there are others which seem to be based on wishful thinking."" Under Ms Batters' vision, when the NFU achieves its Net Zero target by 2040 it will supply the UK market and also export low-carbon meat to countries where livestock farming conditions are less favourable. By then, she believes, the true value of animals in the extensive farm system will be recognised. Prof Smith from the IPCC and Sir Ian have a very different vision. They suggest UK climate policies could lead to the re-wilding of most unproductive hill land, leaving a scattering of animals to adorn the landscape for tourists. One could ask the question: how many sheep is enough? Meanwhile cattle and sheep production would be largely restricted to more profitable lowland farms where the soil isn't rich enough to grow wheat, but is good for grass. And here's a thought to end on. At the press conference of the latest inter-governmental climate report I asked if scientists could be sure whether intensive or extensive systems were better for the environment. The answer: We don't know. I then asked if it would be better to graze the hills or leave trees to take over. The answer: We don't know. According to Dr Michelle Cain, an Oxford academic who specialises in greenhouse gas calculations, the real answer isn't really ""we don't know"", but ""it depends"". So if the government fears the climate may reach a tipping point shortly, that points to cutting methane - a short-lived greenhouse gas - as soon as possible. Which means restricting extensive British-type farming. If the fears focus on planetary heating in the longer term, then it may make more sense to target CO2. That would mean restricting intensive farming. This suggests that any incoming government will base its countryside and farming policy partly on science but partly on politics and culture.

""Ronan and Christopher, hand yourselves in,"" said Det Ch Insp Daniel Stoten, who is leading the lorry deaths investigation for Essex Police. ""We need you both to come forward and assist this investigation."" ""The sooner we can make this happen, the sooner we can progress with our investigation,"" he said. Police have also said that ""at this time"" it believes ""the victims are Vietnamese nationals"", and that they are in contact with the Vietnamese government. ""We are in direct contact with a number of families in Vietnam and the UK, and we believe we have identified families for some of the victims whose journey ended in tragedy on our shores,"" Assistant Chief Constable Tim Smith of Essex Police said. ""The confirmatory evidence needed to formally present cases to HM Senior Coroner for her consideration has not yet been obtained."" Eamonn Harrison was arrested in Dublin on a European Arrest Warrant Mr Stoten, who is leading the lorry deaths investigation for Essex Police, said the Hughes brothers have links to Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. They are also connected to the road haulage and shipping industries. Essex Police have said the brothers are from County Armagh but it is understood they are originally from County Monaghan in the Republic of Ireland. They have at least one business address in Northern Ireland. The PSNI stopped and seized a lorry on Thursday, believed to be connected to the Hughes brothers. No further arrests were made. This video can not be played Christopher (left) and Ronan Hughes are wanted by police, says Det Ch Insp Daniel Stoten The driver of the lorry in which the bodies were found, Maurice Robinson, appeared in court in Chelmsford on Monday. The 25-year-old, of Laurel Drive, Craigavon, is charged with a string of offences, including 39 counts of manslaughter. Prosecutors alleged that Mr Robinson was part ofa ""global ring"" of people smugglers. He was remanded in custody and is due to appear again at the Old Bailey in London later this month. Police stopped a lorry on Thursday, believed to be connected to the Hughes brothers All eight women and 31 men are thought to have been adults except one ""young adult"" woman who, police previously said may have been a teenager. Police initially believed the victims to be Chinese nationals but their efforts to identify them are now focusing on the Vietnamese community. VietHome, a popular Vietnamese community forum in the UK, said it had passed on the pictures of almost 20 people who have been reported missing to detectives. On Friday, the police in Vietnam's Ha Tinh province said that they have charged two unnamed people with ""organising or brokering illegal immigration"". They said the arrests were made after 10 local families reported their children - who were on their way to the UK - missing. Many of the families who have reported missing relatives know the names of the brokers who organised their journeys, says the BBC's Jonathan Head in Hanoi. Some are said to be local people familiar to communities which have a tradition of sending people overseas to work. British law enforcement officers have been working with Vietnamese authorities in an attempt to suppress human trafficking over the past number of years, adds our correspondent. Sources in Hanoi say there has been some progress, but people smuggling is still hugely lucrative and thriving in Vietnam. The Vietnamese embassy in London has set up a contact line for people to get in touch. GPS data shows the refrigerated container trailer in which the bodies were found crossed back and forth between the UK and continental Europe in the days before it was found. It was leased from the company Global Trailer Rentals on 15 October. The company said it was ""entirely unaware that the trailer was to be used in the manner in which it appears to have been"". It is not the lorry police seized on 31 October in Northern Ireland. Sources say the GPS data shows it left Monaghan in the Republic of Ireland on 15 October before crossing over to Northern Ireland and then returning south to Dublin From Dublin, it crossed over to Holyhead in Wales overnight on 16 October That evening, it travelled to continental Europe from Dover to Calais in France Between 17 and 22 October, it moved between various cities in Belgium and France, including Dunkirk, Bruges and Lille On 22 October, it made its final crossing from Zeebrugge to Purfleet Essex Police said the tractor unit (the front part of the lorry) had entered the UK via Holyhead - an Irish Sea port in Wales - on 20 October, having travelled over from Dublin. Police believe the tractor unit collected the trailer in Purfleet on the River Thames and left the port shortly after 01:05 on 23 October. Police were called to the industrial park where the bodies were discovered about half an hour later. Temperatures in refrigerated units can be as low as -25C (-13F). The lorry now is at a secure site in Essex. Early reports had suggested the lorry may have arrived from Bulgaria but its government has since clarified that while the tractor unit was registered there in 2017 it had not entered the country since. This article was based on public announcements and appeals made by Essex Police at the relevant time. Christopher Hughes denies any involvement in these offences and Essex Police has since confirmed no further action will be taken against him. Since the publication of this article, his older brother, Ronan Hughes, 41, and Maurice Robinson, 26, both of County Armagh, have pleaded guilty to manslaughter. On 21 December 2020, the Crown Court, sitting at the Old Bailey, found Eamonn Harrison, 24 of Newry, County Down, and Gheorghe Nica, 43 of Basildon, Essex, guilty of manslaughter and Christopher Kennedy, 24, of County Armagh, and Valentin Calota 38, of Birmingham, guilty of conspiring to assist illegal immigration.

"Aceh Ulema Council (MPU) member Mukhlis reacts as he is punished in public An Indonesian man - who worked for an organisation that helped draft strict adultery laws - has been publicly whipped after being caught having an affair with a married woman. Mukhlis bin Muhammad of the Aceh Ulema Council (MPU) was flogged 28 times. The woman he had the affair with was caned 23 times. Mukhlis is from the deeply conservative Aceh region, the only place in Indonesia which practises the strict Islamic law, Sharia. Gay sex and gambling are also punishable by public caning in Aceh. ""This is God's law. Anyone must be flogged if proven guilty, even if he is a member of the MPU,"" Husaini Wahab, the deputy mayor of Aceh Besar district, where Mukhlis lives, told BBC News Indonesia. The couple were caught by officials in September, apparently in a car parked near a tourist beach. The caning happened on Thursday. Mr Husaini added that Mukhlis would be expelled from the MPU. The 46-year-old is also an Islamic religious leader. He is the first religious leader to be publicly caned in Aceh since Sharia law came into force in 2005. The MPU advises the local government and legislature on drafting and implementing Sharia law in Aceh. No place left to hide for Aceh's gay people The countries that cane their convicts Aceh was granted special rights to introduce its own stricter Islamic laws more than a decade ago. Laws against homosexuality were passed in 2014 and came into effect the following year. Extra-marital sex, gambling, and the consumption, production and distribution of alcohol are all illegal under Sharia law. In 2017, two men were caned 83 times each in Aceh after they were caught having sex. Canes are typically made from rattan. Those carrying out the caning have all their body parts, except their eyes, covered to stop them from being identified. The caning must take place publicly on an open-air platform, though children are barred from watching. Sharia law applies to Muslims and non-Muslims alike in Aceh.

"The bodies were discovered in the early hours of 23 October Essex Police has started extradition proceedings to bring a man from Ireland to the UK to face charges of manslaughter over the deaths of 39 people in the back of a lorry. Eamonn Harrison, 22, from Northern Ireland, was arrested in Dublin on a European Arrest Warrant. In Vietnam police have arrested two people over people smuggling. Police in Belfast have also appealed to two brothers wanted in connection with the deaths to hand themselves in. Ronan, 40, and Christopher Hughes, 34, are wanted on suspicion of manslaughter and people trafficking. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

On Friday, police confirmed they had spoken to Ronan Hughes by phone, but added that they needed to speak to the brothers in person. ""Ronan and Christopher, hand yourselves in,"" said Det Ch Insp Daniel Stoten, who is leading the lorry deaths investigation for Essex Police. ""We need you both to come forward and assist this investigation."" ""The sooner we can make this happen, the sooner we can progress with our investigation,"" he said. Police have also said that ""at this time"" it believes ""the victims are Vietnamese nationals"", and that they are in contact with the Vietnamese government. ""We are in direct contact with a number of families in Vietnam and the UK, and we believe we have identified families for some of the victims whose journey ended in tragedy on our shores,"" Assistant Chief Constable Tim Smith of Essex Police said. ""The confirmatory evidence needed to formally present cases to HM Senior Coroner for her consideration has not yet been obtained."" Eamonn Harrison was arrested in Dublin on a European Arrest Warrant Mr Stoten, who is leading the lorry deaths investigation for Essex Police, said the Hughes brothers have links to Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. They are also connected to the road haulage and shipping industries. Essex Police have said the brothers are from County Armagh but it is understood they are originally from County Monaghan in the Republic of Ireland. They have at least one business address in Northern Ireland. The PSNI stopped and seized a lorry on Thursday, believed to be connected to the Hughes brothers. No further arrests were made. This video can not be played Christopher (left) and Ronan Hughes are wanted by police, says Det Ch Insp Daniel Stoten The driver of the lorry in which the bodies were found, Maurice Robinson, appeared in court in Chelmsford on Monday. The 25-year-old, of Laurel Drive, Craigavon, is charged with a string of offences, including 39 counts of manslaughter. Prosecutors alleged that Mr Robinson was part ofa ""global ring"" of people smugglers. He was remanded in custody and is due to appear again at the Old Bailey in London later this month. Police stopped a lorry on Thursday, believed to be connected to the Hughes brothers All eight women and 31 men are thought to have been adults except one ""young adult"" woman who, police previously said may have been a teenager. Police initially believed the victims to be Chinese nationals but their efforts to identify them are now focusing on the Vietnamese community. VietHome, a popular Vietnamese community forum in the UK, said it had passed on the pictures of almost 20 people who have been reported missing to detectives. On Friday, the police in Vietnam's Ha Tinh province said that they have charged two unnamed people with ""organising or brokering illegal immigration"". They said the arrests were made after 10 local families reported their children - who were on their way to the UK - missing. Many of the families who have reported missing relatives know the names of the brokers who organised their journeys, says the BBC's Jonathan Head in Hanoi. Some are said to be local people familiar to communities which have a tradition of sending people overseas to work. British law enforcement officers have been working with Vietnamese authorities in an attempt to suppress human trafficking over the past number of years, adds our correspondent. Sources in Hanoi say there has been some progress, but people smuggling is still hugely lucrative and thriving in Vietnam. The Vietnamese embassy in London has set up a contact line for people to get in touch. GPS data shows the refrigerated container trailer in which the bodies were found crossed back and forth between the UK and continental Europe in the days before it was found. It was leased from the company Global Trailer Rentals on 15 October. The company said it was ""entirely unaware that the trailer was to be used in the manner in which it appears to have been"". It is not the lorry police seized on 31 October in Northern Ireland. Sources say the GPS data shows it left Monaghan in the Republic of Ireland on 15 October before crossing over to Northern Ireland and then returning south to Dublin From Dublin, it crossed over to Holyhead in Wales overnight on 16 October That evening, it travelled to continental Europe from Dover to Calais in France Between 17 and 22 October, it moved between various cities in Belgium and France, including Dunkirk, Bruges and Lille On 22 October, it made its final crossing from Zeebrugge to Purfleet Essex Police said the tractor unit (the front part of the lorry) had entered the UK via Holyhead - an Irish Sea port in Wales - on 20 October, having travelled over from Dublin. Police believe the tractor unit collected the trailer in Purfleet on the River Thames and left the port shortly after 01:05 on 23 October. Police were called to the industrial park where the bodies were discovered about half an hour later. Temperatures in refrigerated units can be as low as -25C (-13F). The lorry now is at a secure site in Essex. Early reports had suggested the lorry may have arrived from Bulgaria but its government has since clarified that while the tractor unit was registered there in 2017 it had not entered the country since. This article was based on public announcements and appeals made by Essex Police at the relevant time. Christopher Hughes denies any involvement in these offences and Essex Police has since confirmed no further action will be taken against him. Since the publication of this article, his older brother, Ronan Hughes, 41, and Maurice Robinson, 26, both of County Armagh, have pleaded guilty to manslaughter. On 21 December 2020, the Crown Court, sitting at the Old Bailey, found Eamonn Harrison, 24 of Newry, County Down, and Gheorghe Nica, 43 of Basildon, Essex, guilty of manslaughter and Christopher Kennedy, 24, of County Armagh, and Valentin Calota 38, of Birmingham, guilty of conspiring to assist illegal immigration. Alexandru-Ovidiu Hanga, 28, of Tilbury, Essex, and Gazmir Nuzi, 43, of Tottenham, north London, admitted assisting unlawful immigration. All defendants were sentenced in January 2021.

"The boy was taken to hospital from the scene in High Road, Tottenham, but he died from his injuries A toddler has died after falling from a block of flats in Tottenham, north London. The child, aged about 18 months, fell from Stellar House, just off Tottenham High Road, on Thursday morning. He was taken to hospital by paramedics where he was pronounced dead an hour later. Haringey Council, which manages the block of flats, said a ""full investigation"" would be carried out. Meral Dervik, a neighbour in Stellar House, claimed the toddler's mother had been complaining to the council about a faulty handle, although the authority has not commented on the claim. She said: ""The window, it was faulty. Nearly two months, that was what [the mother] was saying. ""She was calling the council to come to fix it. The handle was not secure."" Ms Dervik said the boy's mother was ""shocked and upset"", and added: ""She was looking after the kids brilliantly, she cared about the children."" Stellar House is located near to Tottenham Hotspur's new stadium Formal identification and a post-mortem examination will take place in due course. The Metropolitan Police has launched an investigation and is treating the death as unexplained. Declining to comment on the issue of faulty windows at the block, the council issued a statement from its chief executive Zina Etheridge that said their ""deepest sympathies"" were with the family. ""We can confirm that the block is managed by Homes for Haringey, who are carrying out a full investigation into the circumstances,"" she said. ""The police are currently investigating and it would be inappropriate for us to comment further, or speculate, until more is known about this very sad incident.""

"Wu Huayan ate only rice and chillies in order to save money to help her ill brother Well-wishers have donated almost a million yuan to a Chinese student who was hospitalised after living on 2 yuan ($0.30, Â£0.20) a day for five years. The case of Wu Huayan shocked Chinese people after it hit the headlines earlier this week. The 24-year old woman became seriously malnourished while struggling to study and support her sick brother. Ms Wu's story also sparked anger at authorities for failing to recognise her plight and help her much earlier. After the story was reported, donations began pouring in for the college student in the city of Guiyang - reportedly totalling some 800,000 yuan ($114,000, Â£88,000). Earlier, this month, the young woman went into hospital after having difficulty breathing, according to Chinese media. She was only 135cm (4ft 5ins) tall, weighing barely more than 20kg (43 pounds; three stones). The doctors found she was suffering from heart and kidney problems due to five years spent eating minimal amounts of food. She said she needed to save money to support her sick brother. Wu Huayan lost her mother when she was four and her father died when she was in school. She and her brother were then supported by their grandmother, and later by an uncle and aunt who could only support them with 300 yuan ($42, Â£32) each month. Most of that money went on the medical bills of her younger brother, who had mental health problems. This meant Ms Wu spent only 2 yuan a day on herself, surviving largely off chillies and rice. The siblings are from Guizhou, one of the poorest provinces in China. This video can not be played China's uphill struggle fighting extreme poverty The case sparked an outpouring of concern - and anger at authorities. Many people on social media said they wanted to help with donations, and many voiced concern about her college not helping her. One user called her situation ""worse than that of refugees in Afghanistan"", while another pointed to the extravagant cost ofChina's 70th anniversary celebrations, saying the money could have been better spent. Others expressed their admiration at her efforts to help her brother, while also persevering with her studies in college. Aside from the donations on crowd funding platforms, her teachers and classmates donated 40,000 yuan ($5,700; Â£4,400), while local villagers collected 30,000 yuan to help her. Officials released a statement saying Ms Wu had been receiving the minimum government subsidy - thought to be between 300 and 700 yuan a month - and was now getting an emergency relief fund of 20,000 yuan. ""We will keep following the case of this strong-minded and kind girl,"" the Tongren City Civil Affairs Bureau said. ""We will actively co-operate with other relevant departments to solve the problem according to the minimum living standard and temporary assistance responsibility that the civil affairs department bears."" The case of Wu Huayan has echoes of a story from 2018 whena Chinese boy arrived at school with his hair full of frozen ice. Dubbed ""Little Wang"", his story also went viral, leading to international donations from people impressed by his resilience, and shocked at his poverty. While China's economy has skyrocketed over the past decades, poverty has not disappeared, and inequality has grown. One major reason cited is the huge divide between rural and urban areas. According to the bureau,the per capita disposable income of a household in the capital Beijing was 57,229 yuan ($8,090; Â£6,300) in 2017,external. As a point of comparison, in rural region of Guizhou where Ms Wu lives, that figure is around 16,703 yuan. China has moved from being ""moderately unequal in 1990 to being one of the world's most unequal countries,""according to a 2018 report,externalby the International Monetary Fund. According to the National Bureau of Statistics in 2017, 30.46 million rural people were still living below the national poverty line of $1.90 a day. China has previously pledged to ""eliminate""poverty by 2020. China's #IceBoy reignites poverty debate China's uphill struggle with poverty.

"A protester in Malaga holds up a sign saying ""No means no"" in support of the Manresa victim A Barcelona court's decision to acquit five men accused of gang-raping a 14-year-old girl of the charge of sexual assault has provoked outrage. The court ruled out rape because the victim was in an ""unconscious state"" and the accused had not used violence or intimidation. This is a requirement under Spanish law for a charge of sexual assault, which is legally the equivalent of rape. Instead, they were convicted and jailed for the lesser crime of sexual abuse. The five were sentenced to between 10 and 12 years in prison. A conviction for sexual assault would have carried prison sentences of between 15 and 20 years. A review is currently taking place in Spain to decide whether to base rape cases on a woman's explicit consent to sex. A number of European countries have changed their laws in recent years to define rape as sex without consent. Sweden changed the law last year and Denmark is doing the same. The Barcelona verdict comes despitea ruling in a similar case by the Spanish Supreme Courtupgrading a conviction from sexual abuse to sexual assault. Barcelona's Mayor Ada Colau denounced it as an ""outrageous sentence"",externalon Twitter. ""I am not a judge and I do not know how many years in prison they deserve, what I do know is that it is not abuse, it is rape!"" Warning: Some readers may find details of this story disturbing Women's rights groups have similarly reacted to the ruling with anger and dismay. Furious social media users have been commenting on the case under hashtags like JusticiaPatriarcal (Patriarchal Justice) and NoEsAbusoEsViolacion (It's not abuse it's rape). The case is known as the ""Manada de Manresa"" - Manresa Wolf Pack - for its similarities toa 2016 gang attack on a teenagerwhich prompted widespread protests and an ongoing review of Spain's rape laws. Lila Corominas, a spokeswoman for the Manresa Feminist Strike Committee, told newspaper Nius Diario this was ""an obvious case of sexual assault and intimidation"". Leader of the MÃ¡s PaÃ­s political party ÃÃ±igo ErrejÃ³n said the sentence was ""shameful"", while Irene Montero, spokeswoman for Unidas Podemos, called for a change in the law ""so we can speak proudly of living in a feminist country"". Some activists are calling for a protest against the court decision,externalin Manresa on Saturday at 13:00 local time (12:00 GMT). The five men were found guilty of abusing the girl during a drinking session known in Spanish as a botellÃ³n at a disused factory in Manresa, a town in the north-eastern region of Catalonia, in October 2016. Prosecutors told the court the men - two Spaniards, two Cubans and one Argentine - took turns to attack the girl, who was under the influence of alcohol and drugs. One of the defendants, named only as Bryan AndrÃ©s M, was said to have told each of them: ""It's your turn. Fifteen minutes each and no delay."" At a previous court hearing, the girl said she remembered very little of what happened but that one of the men had been brandishing a gun. All the defendants denied the allegations, although the DNA of one of them was found on the girl's underwear. A similar case sparked fury in Spain, and was later overturned by the Supreme Court The court ruled that the victim did ""not know what she was and wasn't doing, and consequently, did not have the ability to agree to or oppose the sexual relations most of the defendants had with her"", El Pais reported. It added that the defendants ""were able to commit sexual acts without using any type of violence or intimidation"". The court eventually awarded the victim â¬12,000 (Â£10,300) damages for an attack it described as ""extremely severe and especially denigrating"". Judges expressed ""surprise"" that the prosecutors changed the charge at the last minute to sexual assault from the initial accusation of sexual abuse. They said they could not see the reasons for the more serious assault offence in the prosecution's arguments. A court in Navarra jailed five men for sexual abuse for a gang attack in Pamplona on an 18-year-old woman who was dragged into the hallway of a residential building. As she appeared ""passive or neutral"", according to a police report, the court decided no intimidation or violence had taken place. This video can not be played Activists say rage over the ""wolfpack"" case ignited a feminist revolution (Video from 2019) In June, the Spanish Supreme Court overturned that ruling, deciding it was sexual assault and that the men were rapists. The five saw their sentences of nine years increased to 15. Spain's prime minister last year appointed a panel to review the rape laws.

"This video can not be played Father of autistic child urges government action to stop 'horrific' detentions ""They placed her in a seclusion cell and they left her there for two years, alone, 24/7, horrific."" Jeremy says he could only touch his 15-year-old daughter Bethany by kneeling down and reaching into her isolation room through a tiny hatch. Bethany is severely autistic but had no therapeutic care while detained in hospital, Jeremy told the BBC. Now MPs and peers say such treatment of young people with learning disabilities or autism breaches their human rights. The Joint Committee on Human Rights says mental health hospitals can inflict ""terrible suffering on those detained... causing anguish to their distraught families"". Its report,externalurges an overhaul of mental health law and hospital inspections in England. ""It must not be allowed to continue,"" said Harriet Harman, who chairs the committee. Bethany's story, BBC File on 4 The failings in learning disability services in six charts 'She was so desperate, she swallowed a toothbrush' After a campaign by her parents, Bethany was briefly sent to an adolescent unit in Staffordshire which did ""brilliant work"", according to her dad. ""She was out in the community. She wasn't locked away. We could take the pet dogs, go for a walk in the grounds. It was brilliant."" But once she turned 18, she could no longer stay in an adolescent unit so she was transferred but not to a similar unit with similar support, says her dad. ""They placed her in an adult medium secure unit that doesn't even specialise in autism."" Bethany's form of autism means she experiences extreme anxiety and, without proper care, can be hard to manage, he told the Victoria Derbyshire programme. He says she has ""deteriorated massively. It's horrendous, She's in a cell again"". ""I had a hatch before that I could hold her hand through. I don't even have that now. I can't hold my daughter."" By law, young people with learning disabilities or autism detained in mental health hospitals must have treatment that is necessary, appropriate and available. But the inquiry, launched in January, heard evidence of ""a significant increase in distress and a worsening of symptoms for those detained, particularly where segregation and restraint have been used"". ""We are concerned that a very broad approach has been taken to the 'appropriate medical treatment' requirement... and the approach appears to be that the most basic provision of care satisfies this test,"" the committee says. ""We consider the human rights of many of those with a learning disability and/or autism are being breached in mental health hospitals."" One young man told the inquiry: ""I did not know what was happening. ""Looking back at it now, it does not feel real. It feels like some sort of nightmare. ""It was not a safe place. It was not a treatment room. I got no assessment or treatment done. ""There was no care. I was just put in this room and I lay there and went to sleep."" Another had his arm broken in a restraint, according to his mother. ""His arm was wrenched up behind his back until the bone snapped. He was not then taken to accident and emergency for 24 hours even though his arm was completely swollen,"" she said. Another mother said her son had been kept in isolation for up to nine hours at a time. ""The rule was that he could not leave until he was quiet,"" she told the inquiry. ""With his anxiety and sensory presentation, there was no way this was possible. ""He started to bang his head against the wall and would bite the wood in the doorframe out of desperation."" Too often, families are excluded from decision-making and when they try to intervene are viewed as hostile and a problem, which is unacceptable, the report says. Families must be recognised as ""human-rights defenders"", it says. The committee says it has ""lost confidence that the system is doing what it says it is doing"", while the regulator, which should be a ""bulwark"" against abuses, is failing and in urgent need of reform. ""Too often it is left to the media to be human rights defenders,"" the report says,highlighting work by the BBC's Panorama programme in uncovering abuse of patients by staff at Whorlton Hall mental-health hospital. The MPs and peers also say they have no confidence government targets to reduce the number of people with learning disabilities or autism in mental-health hospitals will be met. They demand: a special No 10 unit to safeguard the human rights of young people with learning disabilities and autism an overhaul of inspections, to include covert surveillance and unannounced visits at night and weekends only individuals who will benefit from treatment are detained in mental hospital families are fully involved in decisions ""This inquiry has shown with stark clarity the urgent change that is needed and we've set out simple proposals for exactly that,"" Ms Harman said. ""They must be driven forward urgently."" Ian Trenholm, chief executive of the Care Quality Commission, which regulates health and social care services in England, said many of the report's recommendations relating to the watchdog were already under way, ""although we are clear there is much still to be done"". Mr Trenholm said an independent review of the CQC's regulation of mental health hospitals had been commissioned and the findings would be used to strengthen this work. ""We know we need to improve how we regulate mental health, learning disability and/or autism services so we can get better at spotting poor care and at using the information people give us,"" he said. ""We are working hard to improve and we want to involve people, families, carers and stakeholder organisations to ensure we get it right.""

"This video can not be played Why do some tumble dryers catch fire? Whirlpool used ""chilling"" non-disclosure agreements ""to silence customers"" while fire-prone tumble dryers remained in UK homes, MPs say. The manufacturer deflected concerns and was too slow to fix the fire danger, which first emerged four years ago, the Commons business committee said. A truly independent product safety agency needed to be created, it added. Whirlpool said its campaign to fix or replace machines was five times more successful than usual product recalls. Dangerous dryers under the Hotpoint, Indesit, Creda, Swan and Proline brands were sold in the UK for 11 years from 2004. They were blamed for a spate of fires after a build up of fluff fell onto the machine's heating element. Whirlpool initially offered to modify affected dryers - a decision widely criticised by consumer and safety groups, and which itself has led to concern over the safety ofsupposedly fixed machines. The danger in our homes: the full story It started a full recall, which includes offering a free replacement dryer, in July after the regulator stepped in. Up to 800,000 machines were estimated to still be in use when the full recall began - a figure which the committee described as ""astonishing"". Rachel Reeves, who chairs the committee, said: ""Whirlpool's response to fixing safety flaws in its tumble dryers has too often owed more to PR management than to taking the practical steps to make its machines safe for customers. ""The Whirlpool tumble dryer saga has dragged on for far too long, leaving customers, now four years on, still fearing they may have potentially unsafe tumble dryers in their homes. Whirlpool has failed to live up to the duties it owes to its customers."" Whirlpool said 102,600 consumers had registered their affected machine since the recall launched in July. The company said these machines had been fixed or replaced within an average of 10 days. Jeff Noel, vice-president of Whirlpool, said: ""Through our ongoing campaign, we have resolved this potential safety issue - which concerns tumble dryers produced by the previous owner of the company - for more than 1.75 million people. This is up to five times the average success rate for a product recall in the UK."" Andy Gibb used to swear by the Hotpoint brand, which had made all the white goods in his home when he was growing up. As a result, when he bought a tumble dryer in 2005, it was a Hotpoint. He looked after it, regularly cleaning the filter, and it is still in his home. The trouble is, it is on the list as a potential fire hazard. The 47-year-old from Liverpool contacted Whirlpool four years ago after it came up on the list of affected models. When he chased them up, the company said their records showed it had replaced the machine in 2016, but he says they have never been to his home. ""It is an absolute sham. At no time has it been replaced or repaired under the safety recall,"" he said. He told Whirlpool: ""Your records are inaccurate, and I would dread to see how many other customers have been treated exactly the same."" After being questioned about the case by the BBC, a Whirlpool spokesman said: ""We sincerely apologise to Mr Gibb for any inconvenience caused and we will resolve the situation for him immediately. ""It appears that due to a data entry error, our records incorrectly showed that his affected dryer had previously been replaced. We have put steps in place to prevent a situation like this happening again."" The committee said that Whirlpool had used non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) on 24 occasions, asking those affected to sign them. They included Jemma Spurr who told the committee in July that she had never received the report on the cause of her fire, or an apology from the company. The committee said: ""It is disgraceful that Whirlpool made customers who had been victims of fires involving its products sign NDAs in order to receive compensation to which they were entitled. Its treatment of Jemma Spurr was lamentable, though we welcome their subsequent apology."" Its report also calls for the establishment of an independent arms-length body, like the Food Standards Agency, equipped with a wide range of civil and criminal sanctions to oversee product safety. The current, relatively new, Office for Product Safety and Standards (OPSS) was in danger of being a toothless regulator, it said. The damage caused by a dryer to a flat in Shepherd's Bush, London Caroline Normand, from consumer group Which?, welcomed the call, saying: ""We need to see swift changes to stop corporations getting away with putting their reputations ahead of public safety."" Other recommendations from the committee included: A regulator to tackle dangerous second-hand and illegal electrical goods being sold online A national injury database and a comprehensive registration and recall hub Indelible marking for electrical goods, to identify them after a fire, in a similar system to cars ""A centralised recall database would form part of the solution in ensuring people are not left in the dark as to whether a dangerous product is in their home,"" said Martyn Allen, technical director of charity Electrical Safety First. ""Our own research has found that consumers believe registering appliances is an inconvenient process, and the recommendation of registering at the point of purchase could help tackle the relatively low number of registered electrical items in the UK."" A spokesman for the Department for Business, which oversees the OPSS, said: ""Without the intervention by the government's OPSS, the recall of Whirlpool tumble dryers simply would not have happened."" He added that Whirlpool's response to the situation would be kept under review. Anyone who thinks they bought a potentially dangerous dryer should call 0800 151 0905 or visita dedicated website,externalto check if their dryer is affected. If it is on the recall list, they should stop using it and unplug it immediately. They can then choose: A free replacement dryer with no extra charges for collection or disposal of the old machine A free, one-hour modification of the old machine A discounted upgrade to a higher specification model than the free replacement A partial refund of up to Â£150, with owners of older machines getting less than those with newer ones Whirlpool recall uncovers 65,000 dangerous dryers Danger dryers: I'm sorry, says Whirlpool exec Warning over danger dryers being sold online LA mayor says winds and drought created 'perfect storm', while officials hit out at looters Biden praises Carter's character as former president's coffin heads to Georgia Henry Zeffman: Market trouble threatens Labour's economic plans The '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty.

"About 7% of children have food allergies, according to King's College London The number of children who received hospital treatment for allergies has increased by 65% across England in the past five years, figures have revealed. In 2013-14, 2,873 teenagers sought treatment whereas in 2017-18 it was 4,743, data from NHS Digital shows. Allergy UK said this could be because this was the age when sufferers started taking responsibility for themselves. There have been calls for the government to introduce legislation on how schools should manage allergies. The figures from NHS Digital, released to BBC London under the Freedom of Information Act, also showed the number of children treated for anaphylactic shock increased by 41% in the past five years. For teenagers, the increase was 36% while for those aged 19 and over, it increased by 10%. Common foods children can be allergic to include shellfish and peanuts Amena Warner, head of clinical services for Allergy UK, said one reason why more teenagers were receiving treatment was because at that age, allergy sufferers started to move away from parental control. She said teenagers might not question food the same way as parents did and may not read food labels in detail, while sufferers might also be more inclined to seek hospital treatment because they had more awareness about what happened during a reaction. Dr Paul Turner, a consultant in Paediatric Allergy and Immunology at Imperial College London, said risk-taking or a lack of self-confidence in managing food allergies was ""almost certainly a factor in the increase in non-fatal anaphylaxis in this age group"".

Following an inquest, the coroner said it was ""vital"" allergy action plans were standardised in hospitals and schools. Why the world is becoming more allergic Peanut-allergy therapy 'protection not a cure' 'I avoid kissing girls because it could kill me' However, allergy specialist Prof Adam Fox said he was seeing a lot of occasions when schools seemed to be failing families. ""In the most extreme cases, parents seem to be genuinely frightened to send them to a school where they don't feel safe,"" said Prof Fox, a paediatric allergist at Evelina London children's hospital. Jenna Laing-Phillips, whose 10-year-old son Stanley has severe allergies, said it could be ""overwhelming because you spend every day thinking about minimising risks"". ""Food is the easy bit in a way, but then you do have to think about the surfaces he's touching, the handles he might be touching. These are the issues we had at school, they don't get it... the risk of cross contamination is huge."" She took Stanley out of his old school in Surrey, saying she believed it did not have proper safeguards in place to protect him, but the school denied the claim and said safeguarding was its ""top priority"". It also said there were no recorded incidents of an allergic reaction by Stanley while he was in the care of the school. ""What we want to know is that our kids are safe in school and that they've done everything they can to minimise the risk and if something was to happen, the school will know what to do because actually they have clear legislation to follow,"" Ms Laing-Phillips said. She launched a petition calling for the introduction of statutory allergy legislation. In its response,external, the government said it considered the ""existing legislation combined with statutory guidance to be sufficient"". There are calls for schools to have clear guidance on how to look after those with allergies All primary and secondary schools in the UK are able to buy adrenaline auto-injectors without a prescription for use in emergencies but some have called for more guidance from the government. At Crowthorne Church of England Primary School in Berkshire, lunch boxes are checked by staff while photos and care plans have been put in place for every child with a food allergy. Every member of staff has also been trained to use an EpiPen. But head teacher Ruth Jackson said better guidance from the government would be reassuring. ""It would be good for head teachers to know what good practice is and to make sure that they are following it because ultimately what every head teacher wants is to make sure they're doing the best for every child,"" she said. The Department for Education said it was ""clear that children with medical conditions should be properly supported to enjoy a full education and be safe at school"". ""All schools are required to make arrangements that ensure this is the case,"" a spokesperson said.

"Nigel Farage says he wants to form a ""leave electoral alliance"" with the Conservatives Launching the Brexit Party's campaign, he urges Boris Johnson to drop his EU deal If the Tories reject his offer of a ""non-aggression pact"", he says his party will stand in every British seat The Tories say a vote for the Brexit Party will let Jeremy Corbyn into Downing Street Nicola Sturgeon says a vote for the SNP is a vote to end the ""Brexit horror show"" The UK will go to the polls for a general election on 12 December Mary O'Connor, Matt Cannon and Becky Morton If you've not had a chance to follow our live blog today, here's a quick round-up of what has happened: Political leaders continued setting out the key messages of their election campaigns ahead of the formal closure of Parliament next Wednesday. Among them was Nigel Farage, who launched the Brexit Party's campaign in Westminster. In his speech, the party leader called for the Conservativesto build a ""leave alliance"" with his partywith the aim of achieving a majority in Parliament. He called on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to drop his Brexit deal or face Brexit Party candidates in every seat. But a Tory source later dismissed the possibility of the party working with him, saying voting for Mr Farage ""risks letting Jeremy Corbyn into Downing Street"". Also on the campaign trail was Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland's First Minister and leader of the SNP, who visited Edinburgh North and Leith, a three-way marginal seat. After President Donald Trump'sradio interview with Mr Farage yesterday, the issue of whether US firms could have access to the NHS under a post-Brexit US-UK trade deal has been a key feature of today's campaigning. You can read BBC health editor Hugh Pym's piece on ""Could the NHS be up for sale?""here. Elsewhere, the government was accused ofusing public funds to target votersin key general election constituencies in with Facebook ads. That's it for our live page today, but you can continue to follow our political coverageon the BBC News channel, and read the main stories of the dayon the BBC News website. Heidi Allen swapped the Tory party for Change UK, before joining the Liberal Democrats A group of equal rights campaigners has called for social media companies to do more to tackle online abuse aimed at female MPs. The Centenary Action Group - whose members include the Jo Cox Foundation - has also called for ""meaningful sanctions"" to tackle allegations of harassment in political parties. It comes after two female MPs - cabinet minister Nicky Morgan and Lib Dem MP Heidi Allen - cited online abuse of MPs when announcing that they were standing down. The group said: ""While women have won the right to vote, our right to participate in public life free from violence, harassment, abuse and all other forms of discrimination continues to be threatened.

John Bercow is demanding an apology from the Daily Mirror over claims he asked for Â£1m to appear on I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here! The outgoing Commons Speaker accuses the paper of ""publishing lies despite being advised of the truth"" and has complained to the press watchdog. The Mirror claimed talks between Mr Bercow and ITV broke down over the size of his appearance fee. Mr Bercow, who retired on Thursday after 10 years in the Speaker's chair, is understood to be furious about the story. Read More The Brexit Party faces a ""tall order"" to fight every seat at the election, says BBC political correspondent Helen Catt. Mr Farage told reporters earlier that his party would field a candidate in every constituency in England, Scotland and Wales - unless the Conservatives agreed a ""non-aggression"" pact with his party. ""That'll leave the Brexit Party needing to find somewhere in the region of 630 candidates,"" Helen says. ""Nigel Farage says he's got about 500 signed up, which will go forward on Monday. ""But it's quite a tall order for a party that of course is very new and has only been in existence for about six months."" Mr Farage earlier said that the party would have enough money to do so, thanks to donations on the party's website. Hugh PymBBC News Health Editor If the early exchanges are anything to go by, health will feature prominently in this election campaign. Labour has for some time argued that the NHS is vulnerable to privatisation under the Conservatives. The party has developed a new attack line, that any post-Brexit trade deal with the US will open the door to big American health corporations. It has also picked up on suggestions that the US authorities will demand that the NHS pays more for drugs supplied by American companies. In essence, Labour is alleging that the NHS is not safe after a Brexit presided over by the Tories. The Conservatives have strongly denied that the NHS is in any way ""up for sale"". They argue that there will be red lines with the British position in any trade talks, which protect the current status of the health service and the drug purchasing regime. Read more Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage has called on the prime minister to drop his Brexit deal in exchange for an election pact. The Conservatives have consistently ruled out a formal pact with the party. But individual voters can still vote tactically - for example by backing a candidate they wouldn't normally support, to stop someone else winning. This could happen in a constituency where two parties are in a tight race and candidates from other parties trail far behind. In these circumstances, a supporter of the candidate who was a distant third, might pick their favourite of the two who are in with a chance. Read our guide to find out more about how tactical voting works. A former Labour MSP has switched allegiance to the SNP, the Scottish party has announced. Anne McTaggart quit Labour, saying that she supported independence for Scotland and that she wanted ""to be part of something positive"". SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said on twitter it was ""great to welcome"" her. The Times deputy political editor tweets...

The BBC has analysed the political parties' activities on Facebook and Instagram today. Labourhas increased its
advertising slightly since yesterday, with a new set focused on
fundraising. The ads are highlighting the difference in donations between
Labour and the Conservatives, and each talks about the âTories' billionaire donorsâ
or just âbillionairesâ. The Lib Demshave begun a new
push on the ""stop Brexit"" campaign video they launched earlier this week.
This time itâs being promoted with a simpler message: âIf you want to stop
Brexit, be a Liberal Democrat voter.â Previously, the message above the video
was: âThe Liberal Democrats are the biggest, strongest party of Remain.â The Conservativeshave only just begun putting out paid-for advertising. But so far they only have two active adverts. Both are specifically about Milton Keynes, and we can assume they are only being
seen by people in Milton Keynes. Plaid Cymruhave launched some new
fundraising adverts with the line: âWales, itâs us. Donate.â (âNi yw Cymru.
Cyfrannwch.â) Meanwhile, neither theSNPand theGreen Partyhave any active adverts on Facebook. This video can not be played Nigel Farage tells Johnson to 'drop the deal' Nigel Farage launched the Brexit Party's election campaign earlier with an attack on Boris Johnson's Brexit deal. Mr Farage offered the Conservative Party a ""non-aggression"" pact with his own Brexit Party in order for the UK to leave the EU. However, Mr Farage also repeatedly criticised Mr Johnson's agreement and called on the prime minister to drop it ""because it's not Brexit"". Chancellor Sajid Javid criticises a Spectator columnist after he suggested planning elections for a time when Muslims can't vote. In an article,externalheadlined, ""If you do one thing this election, stop your kids voting"", Rod Liddle wrote: ""My own choice of election date would be a day when universities are closed and Muslims are forbidden to do anything on pain of hell, or something. ""There must be at least one day like that in the Muslim calendar, surely? That would deliver at least 40 seats to the Tories, I reckon."" Mr Javid, who is of Muslim heritage, tweets that Mr Liddle's comments are ""not funny and not acceptable"": Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Responding to the criticism, Mr Liddle says his words had been taken ""out of context"". Writing on the Spectator website,external, he says: ""There was no hate speech or Islamophobia whatsoever in my piece. ""They were very obviously ludicrous suggestions, satirical in manner, about how to reduce the Labour vote by targeting groups which traditionally vote Labour and occasioned by the wrangling over whether the election should be on December 9 or 12 and the reasons for that wrangling."" Tory Brexiteer Steve Baker says it is ""completely inconceivable"" the Tories will make a pact with the Brexit Party. The chairman of the pro-Brexit European Research Group tells the PA news agency he will not abandon his support for the prime minister's deal to avoid a challenge from Nigel Farage's party. ""The reason every Conservative Eurosceptic MP
backed the deal is that it can deliver a Brexit worth having,"" he says. ""But Boris will only negotiate a great future for
the UK if he has a good majority of resolute Conservative MPs."" ""Nigel now risks that and our future."" The World at OneBBC Radio 4 Brexiteer Conservative MP Mark Francois says Nigel Farage has ""screwed up"" his bid for a non-aggression pact between the Brexit Party and the Tories. He tells BBC Radio 4's World At One: ""If you genuinely want to work with another political party (to form a Leave alliance), you don't go on live national television and call them liars."" He adds: ""If that was meant to be an olive branch - Nigel completely cocked it up."" The Brexit Party leader is a ""very talented politician"", he says, but his ""ego got the better of him"" when launching his party's election campaign earlier. Mr Francois defends Boris Johnson's Brexit deal, saying that he and fellow Eurosceptic Tory MPs would not have voted for it if they thought it kept the UK in the EU. And he also rejects Mr Farage's prediction that there are Tory MPs who regret voting for the deal. ""I don't think he's going to bully any Tory MP into doing what they don't want to do,"" he adds. Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent Nigel
Farage has, in effect, given Boris Johnson an ultimatum; abandon your central
Brexit policy or the Brexit Party will challenge your deal at every
opportunity across the country. With the prime minister highly likely to
refuse, it seems Mr Farage will have to live up to his promise of fielding 500
or more candidates in this election by Monday - and his claim that he has the
resources to do so. Thatâs a tall order for a party only launched in April. He's no doubt buoyed by the Brexit Party's success in the European Elections
earlier this year. But in the past, when at the helm of UKIP, Mr Farage has
struggled to turn popular support into Westminster seats. He has been targeting
Labour leave areas in Wales, the Midlands and the North of England; the very
seats Mr Johnson has in his sights. The risk for both parties is by splitting
the Leave vote they give Jeremy Corbyn an unintended boost. The World at OneBBC Radio 4 Polling expert Sir John Curtice says it is ""unlikely"" that the Brexit Party standing in the election would do more harm to Labour than to the Conservatives. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's World At One, he says opinion polls suggest that most of the Brexit Party's support comes from former Tory voters. He says: ""If you look at those constituencies that the Conservatives want to pick up - the 50 most marginal Labour seats - they are disproportionately Leave seats. ""And they are places where UKIP did well in 2015. ""The odds are that these are therefore places where the Brexit Party can be expected to do particularly well."" Meanwhile, he says that attempts to convince Remain voters to vote tactically against the Conservatives reflects ""the fact that the Remain vote is split"". He adds that in constituencies which voted to leave the EU, the majority of Labour voters backed Remain. ""So even there Labour's problem is the Liberal Democrats, not necessarily Nigel Farage,"" he says. BBC political correspondent tweets... Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played Father of autistic child urges government action to stop 'horrific' detentions ""They placed her in a seclusion cell and they left her there for two years, alone, 24/7, horrific."" Jeremy says he could only touch his 15-year-old daughter Bethany by kneeling down and reaching into her isolation room through a tiny hatch. Bethany is severely autistic but had no therapeutic care while detained in hospital, Jeremy told the BBC. Now MPs and peers say such treatment of young people with learning disabilities or autism breaches their human rights. The Joint Committee on Human Rights says mental health hospitals can inflict ""terrible suffering on those detained... causing anguish to their distraught families"". Its report,externalurges an overhaul of mental health law and hospital inspections in England. ""It must not be allowed to continue,"" said Harriet Harman, who chairs the committee. Bethany's story, BBC File on 4 The failings in learning disability services in six charts 'She was so desperate, she swallowed a toothbrush' After a campaign by her parents, Bethany was briefly sent to an adolescent unit in Staffordshire which did ""brilliant work"", according to her dad. ""She was out in the community. She wasn't locked away. We could take the pet dogs, go for a walk in the grounds. It was brilliant."" But once she turned 18, she could no longer stay in an adolescent unit so she was transferred but not to a similar unit with similar support, says her dad. ""They placed her in an adult medium secure unit that doesn't even specialise in autism."" Bethany's form of autism means she experiences extreme anxiety and, without proper care, can be hard to manage, he told the Victoria Derbyshire programme. He says she has ""deteriorated massively. It's horrendous, She's in a cell again"". ""I had a hatch before that I could hold her hand through. I don't even have that now. I can't hold my daughter."" By law, young people with learning disabilities or autism detained in mental health hospitals must have treatment that is necessary, appropriate and available. But the inquiry, launched in January, heard evidence of ""a significant increase in distress and a worsening of symptoms for those detained, particularly where segregation and restraint have been used"". ""We are concerned that a very broad approach has been taken to the 'appropriate medical treatment' requirement... and the approach appears to be that the most basic provision of care satisfies this test,"" the committee says. ""We consider the human rights of many of those with a learning disability and/or autism are being breached in mental health hospitals."" One young man told the inquiry: ""I did not know what was happening. ""Looking back at it now, it does not feel real. It feels like some sort of nightmare. ""It was not a safe place. It was not a treatment room. I got no assessment or treatment done. ""There was no care. I was just put in this room and I lay there and went to sleep."" Another had his arm broken in a restraint, according to his mother. ""His arm was wrenched up behind his back until the bone snapped. He was not then taken to accident and emergency for 24 hours even though his arm was completely swollen,"" she said. Another mother said her son had been kept in isolation for up to nine hours at a time. ""The rule was that he could not leave until he was quiet,"" she told the inquiry. ""With his anxiety and sensory presentation, there was no way this was possible. ""He started to bang his head against the wall and would bite the wood in the doorframe out of desperation."" Too often, families are excluded from decision-making and when they try to intervene are viewed as hostile and a problem, which is unacceptable, the report says. Families must be recognised as ""human-rights defenders"", it says. The committee says it has ""lost confidence that the system is doing what it says it is doing"", while the regulator, which should be a ""bulwark"" against abuses, is failing and in urgent need of reform. ""Too often it is left to the media to be human rights defenders,"" the report says,highlighting work by the BBC's Panorama programme in uncovering abuse of patients by staff at Whorlton Hall mental-health hospital. The MPs and peers also say they have no confidence government targets to reduce the number of people with learning disabilities or autism in mental-health hospitals will be met. They demand: a special No 10 unit to safeguard the human rights of young people with learning disabilities and autism an overhaul of inspections, to include covert surveillance and unannounced visits at night and weekends only individuals who will benefit from treatment are detained in mental hospital families are fully involved in decisions ""This inquiry has shown with stark clarity the urgent change that is needed and we've set out simple proposals for exactly that,"" Ms Harman said. ""They must be driven forward urgently."" Ian Trenholm, chief executive of the Care Quality Commission, which regulates health and social care services in England, said many of the report's recommendations relating to the watchdog were already under way, ""although we are clear there is much still to be done"". Mr Trenholm said an independent review of the CQC's regulation of mental health hospitals had been commissioned and the findings would be used to strengthen this work. ""We know we need to improve how we regulate mental health, learning disability and/or autism services so we can get better at spotting poor care and at using the information people give us,"" he said.

"This video can not be played Why do some tumble dryers catch fire? Whirlpool used ""chilling"" non-disclosure agreements ""to silence customers"" while fire-prone tumble dryers remained in UK homes, MPs say. The manufacturer deflected concerns and was too slow to fix the fire danger, which first emerged four years ago, the Commons business committee said. A truly independent product safety agency needed to be created, it added. Whirlpool said its campaign to fix or replace machines was five times more successful than usual product recalls. Dangerous dryers under the Hotpoint, Indesit, Creda, Swan and Proline brands were sold in the UK for 11 years from 2004. They were blamed for a spate of fires after a build up of fluff fell onto the machine's heating element. Whirlpool initially offered to modify affected dryers - a decision widely criticised by consumer and safety groups, and which itself has led to concern over the safety ofsupposedly fixed machines. The danger in our homes: the full story It started a full recall, which includes offering a free replacement dryer, in July after the regulator stepped in. Up to 800,000 machines were estimated to still be in use when the full recall began - a figure which the committee described as ""astonishing"". Rachel Reeves, who chairs the committee, said: ""Whirlpool's response to fixing safety flaws in its tumble dryers has too often owed more to PR management than to taking the practical steps to make its machines safe for customers. ""The Whirlpool tumble dryer saga has dragged on for far too long, leaving customers, now four years on, still fearing they may have potentially unsafe tumble dryers in their homes. Whirlpool has failed to live up to the duties it owes to its customers."" Whirlpool said 102,600 consumers had registered their affected machine since the recall launched in July. The company said these machines had been fixed or replaced within an average of 10 days. Jeff Noel, vice-president of Whirlpool, said: ""Through our ongoing campaign, we have resolved this potential safety issue - which concerns tumble dryers produced by the previous owner of the company - for more than 1.75 million people. This is up to five times the average success rate for a product recall in the UK."" Andy Gibb used to swear by the Hotpoint brand, which had made all the white goods in his home when he was growing up. As a result, when he bought a tumble dryer in 2005, it was a Hotpoint. He looked after it, regularly cleaning the filter, and it is still in his home. The trouble is, it is on the list as a potential fire hazard. The 47-year-old from Liverpool contacted Whirlpool four years ago after it came up on the list of affected models. When he chased them up, the company said their records showed it had replaced the machine in 2016, but he says they have never been to his home. ""It is an absolute sham. At no time has it been replaced or repaired under the safety recall,"" he said. He told Whirlpool: ""Your records are inaccurate, and I would dread to see how many other customers have been treated exactly the same."" After being questioned about the case by the BBC, a Whirlpool spokesman said: ""We sincerely apologise to Mr Gibb for any inconvenience caused and we will resolve the situation for him immediately. ""It appears that due to a data entry error, our records incorrectly showed that his affected dryer had previously been replaced. We have put steps in place to prevent a situation like this happening again."" The committee said that Whirlpool had used non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) on 24 occasions, asking those affected to sign them. They included Jemma Spurr who told the committee in July that she had never received the report on the cause of her fire, or an apology from the company. The committee said: ""It is disgraceful that Whirlpool made customers who had been victims of fires involving its products sign NDAs in order to receive compensation to which they were entitled. Its treatment of Jemma Spurr was lamentable, though we welcome their subsequent apology."" Its report also calls for the establishment of an independent arms-length body, like the Food Standards Agency, equipped with a wide range of civil and criminal sanctions to oversee product safety. The current, relatively new, Office for Product Safety and Standards (OPSS) was in danger of being a toothless regulator, it said. The damage caused by a dryer to a flat in Shepherd's Bush, London Caroline Normand, from consumer group Which?, welcomed the call, saying: ""We need to see swift changes to stop corporations getting away with putting their reputations ahead of public safety."" Other recommendations from the committee included: A regulator to tackle dangerous second-hand and illegal electrical goods being sold online A national injury database and a comprehensive registration and recall hub Indelible marking for electrical goods, to identify them after a fire, in a similar system to cars ""A centralised recall database would form part of the solution in ensuring people are not left in the dark as to whether a dangerous product is in their home,"" said Martyn Allen, technical director of charity Electrical Safety First. ""Our own research has found that consumers believe registering appliances is an inconvenient process, and the recommendation of registering at the point of purchase could help tackle the relatively low number of registered electrical items in the UK."" A spokesman for the Department for Business, which oversees the OPSS, said: ""Without the intervention by the government's OPSS, the recall of Whirlpool tumble dryers simply would not have happened."" He added that Whirlpool's response to the situation would be kept under review. Anyone who thinks they bought a potentially dangerous dryer should call 0800 151 0905 or visita dedicated website,externalto check if their dryer is affected. If it is on the recall list, they should stop using it and unplug it immediately. They can then choose: A free replacement dryer with no extra charges for collection or disposal of the old machine A free, one-hour modification of the old machine A discounted upgrade to a higher specification model than the free replacement A partial refund of up to Â£150, with owners of older machines getting less than those with newer ones Whirlpool recall uncovers 65,000 dangerous dryers Danger dryers: I'm sorry, says Whirlpool exec Warning over danger dryers being sold online LA mayor says winds and drought created 'perfect storm', while officials hit out at looters Biden praises Carter's character as former president's coffin heads to Georgia Henry Zeffman: Market trouble threatens Labour's economic plans The '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty.

"This video can not be played Father of autistic child urges government action to stop 'horrific' detentions ""They placed her in a seclusion cell and they left her there for two years, alone, 24/7, horrific."" Jeremy says he could only touch his 15-year-old daughter Bethany by kneeling down and reaching into her isolation room through a tiny hatch. Bethany is severely autistic but had no therapeutic care while detained in hospital, Jeremy told the BBC. Now MPs and peers say such treatment of young people with learning disabilities or autism breaches their human rights. The Joint Committee on Human Rights says mental health hospitals can inflict ""terrible suffering on those detained... causing anguish to their distraught families"". Its report,externalurges an overhaul of mental health law and hospital inspections in England. ""It must not be allowed to continue,"" said Harriet Harman, who chairs the committee. Bethany's story, BBC File on 4 The failings in learning disability services in six charts 'She was so desperate, she swallowed a toothbrush' After a campaign by her parents, Bethany was briefly sent to an adolescent unit in Staffordshire which did ""brilliant work"", according to her dad. ""She was out in the community. She wasn't locked away. We could take the pet dogs, go for a walk in the grounds. It was brilliant."" But once she turned 18, she could no longer stay in an adolescent unit so she was transferred but not to a similar unit with similar support, says her dad. ""They placed her in an adult medium secure unit that doesn't even specialise in autism."" Bethany's form of autism means she experiences extreme anxiety and, without proper care, can be hard to manage, he told the Victoria Derbyshire programme. He says she has ""deteriorated massively. It's horrendous, She's in a cell again"". ""I had a hatch before that I could hold her hand through. I don't even have that now. I can't hold my daughter."" By law, young people with learning disabilities or autism detained in mental health hospitals must have treatment that is necessary, appropriate and available. But the inquiry, launched in January, heard evidence of ""a significant increase in distress and a worsening of symptoms for those detained, particularly where segregation and restraint have been used"". ""We are concerned that a very broad approach has been taken to the 'appropriate medical treatment' requirement... and the approach appears to be that the most basic provision of care satisfies this test,"" the committee says. ""We consider the human rights of many of those with a learning disability and/or autism are being breached in mental health hospitals."" One young man told the inquiry: ""I did not know what was happening. ""Looking back at it now, it does not feel real. It feels like some sort of nightmare. ""It was not a safe place. It was not a treatment room. I got no assessment or treatment done. ""There was no care. I was just put in this room and I lay there and went to sleep."" Another had his arm broken in a restraint, according to his mother. ""His arm was wrenched up behind his back until the bone snapped. He was not then taken to accident and emergency for 24 hours even though his arm was completely swollen,"" she said. Another mother said her son had been kept in isolation for up to nine hours at a time. ""The rule was that he could not leave until he was quiet,"" she told the inquiry. ""With his anxiety and sensory presentation, there was no way this was possible. ""He started to bang his head against the wall and would bite the wood in the doorframe out of desperation."" Too often, families are excluded from decision-making and when they try to intervene are viewed as hostile and a problem, which is unacceptable, the report says. Families must be recognised as ""human-rights defenders"", it says. The committee says it has ""lost confidence that the system is doing what it says it is doing"", while the regulator, which should be a ""bulwark"" against abuses, is failing and in urgent need of reform. ""Too often it is left to the media to be human rights defenders,"" the report says,highlighting work by the BBC's Panorama programme in uncovering abuse of patients by staff at Whorlton Hall mental-health hospital. The MPs and peers also say they have no confidence government targets to reduce the number of people with learning disabilities or autism in mental-health hospitals will be met. They demand: a special No 10 unit to safeguard the human rights of young people with learning disabilities and autism an overhaul of inspections, to include covert surveillance and unannounced visits at night and weekends only individuals who will benefit from treatment are detained in mental hospital families are fully involved in decisions ""This inquiry has shown with stark clarity the urgent change that is needed and we've set out simple proposals for exactly that,"" Ms Harman said. ""They must be driven forward urgently."" Ian Trenholm, chief executive of the Care Quality Commission, which regulates health and social care services in England, said many of the report's recommendations relating to the watchdog were already under way, ""although we are clear there is much still to be done"". Mr Trenholm said an independent review of the CQC's regulation of mental health hospitals had been commissioned and the findings would be used to strengthen this work. ""We know we need to improve how we regulate mental health, learning disability and/or autism services so we can get better at spotting poor care and at using the information people give us,"" he said. ""We are working hard to improve and we want to involve people, families, carers and stakeholder organisations to ensure we get it right.""

"Rowan was in a cast and on a traction to treat her hip dysplasia Routine hip checks for babies are failing to spot problems that can lead to major surgery and complications in later life, doctors have said. Research by surgeons based in Dundee found four out of every five cases of undiagnosed hip dysplasia were missed at the six-week GP check. They said specialist roles should be created to improve early detection rates at the first check on the maternity ward. Rowan was in a cast which kept her hips in a ""froggy"" position Rowan Beattie's father Derek knew something was not right the first time he tried to change his baby daughter's nappy. He told health visitors it was hard to manipulate her legs to get her in the correct position but he was assured she was fine. The GP check at six weeks also did not pick up her condition. It was only when Rowan, from Carnoustie in Angus, was almost four months old and saw a physiotherapist about an unrelated neck problem that developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) was discovered - and only then because of the persistence of her father. Rowan's mother Allison said they were ""lucky"" that a young physio, who had worked with an expert in the field, knew what to look for - but, even so, they had missed the vital window for early treatment. ""It should not be down to luck,"" she said. ""It should be proper training or systems that make sure it is picked up at the right time."" Derek, Allison and Rowan, who is now four and fully recovered DDH is a relatively common condition. Full hip dislocation, where the ball is not positioned properly in the socket joint, affects about 1.3 cases per 1,000 but there are 6.1 cases per 1,000 where the hip socket is underdeveloped. If spotted early, treatment can be managed quite simply but after about 12 weeks old it may mean major surgery. Although Rowan was still a baby, she was beyond the early diagnosis window and had to undergo a week of traction. She was also put in a Spica cast, which covers the legs, waist and part of the abdomen. Allison said the cast made breastfeeding very difficult and she found it hard to hold and comfort her child. However, she said it was easier to have a baby in a cast than a child who is not diagnosed until they start walking. Rowan is now four and, although she will need regular checks, doctors said her hips had healed and she could lead an active life. Leanne Atkinson and Jordan Thomson with daughter Elena, who was diagnosed at a month old Leanne Atkinson's daughter Elena was diagnosed at just one month old when a special scan for big babies showed her right hip was out of place. Elena, from Guardbridge in Fife, is now four-and-a-half months old and the problem has been corrected. Because she was so young, Elena's treatment involved a Pavlik harness - a padded harness that holds a baby's legs out to the side in a bent position. The harness allows the hip to centre in a much more natural position. Elena was treated using a Pavlik harness As the child grows, nature does the rest, said Donald Campbell, a consultant orthopaedic surgeon at NHS Tayside. ""It is a very natural way of getting rid of hip dysplasia,"" he said. ""It is a very gentle, controlled method, which does not cause any discomfort."" Mr Campbell said there was a success of rate of more than 90% for cases in which a Pavlik harness was used for six to 12 weeks. ""And it will give her a normal hip for the rest of her adult life,"" he said. Mr Campbell said that if children are not diagnosed until walking age or later it is much harder to get a normal result. ""If we can identify it early and pick it up in the first few months of life, like Elena, then we can have a very good result,"" he said. Mike Reidy said the people carrying out the checks needed to be experienced Consultant orthopaedic surgeon Mike Reidy said his research found that the GP check at six weeks was only picking up one case in every five who would go on to present late with hip dysplasia. He said he had sympathy with doctors because examining a child's hip at that age was ""very difficult"". Newborn hip checks 'have failed to prevent late diagnosis' Researchers said the best time to pick up hip dysplasia was in the first 72 hours after birth. They called for better baby checks to be done in the first week of life by expert examiners. The surgeons also called for greater public awareness of the issue and said parents should be encouraged to use baby carriers such as those provided in the government-issued baby boxes, which kept young infants' legs in the correct ""frog-like"" position. Jamie Maclean, an orthopaedic surgeon in Tayside, said he felt patients were being ""failed"" in not picking up the condition at an early stage. He said: ""When you visit different countries, Sweden for example, the rate of late surgery for this condition is down to the bare minimum. ""They express surprise when you discuss how large our figures are and the amount of major surgery that is taking place around the UK."" A Scottish government spokesman said: ""We recognise that it is essential to ensure that the routine examination of newborns is undertaken to a high standard by appropriately-trained staff. ""Our Best Start review of maternity and neonatal care made recommendations related to the examination of newborns, including on governance and audit of the examination itself, and discussions are under way on how to implement this.""

"This video can not be played ""There's no quick route in this industry"" Young people are being put off jobs in hairdressing due to ""dumb"" stereotypes, stylists have warned. Figures show the number of hairdressing apprentices in Wales has fallen by 40% since 2012-13. Celebrity stylist Ken Picton said colleges, careers advisers and politicians needed to stop treating beauty as an ""unintelligent"" industry. The Welsh Government said it was working with businesses to align skills with the needs of the economy. The health and beauty sector contributes an estimated Â£6.6bn a year to the UK economy, of which up to Â£237m is in Wales, according to data in anindustry report this year,external. But, according to the report, some working in the sector feel ""side-lined"" by policy makers and want teachers and careers advisors to be better informed. Figures for 2017 Â£194 - Â£237mcontribution to the Welsh economy About 15,000people are employed  in Wales in the sector 86%are women 14%are men 6%of business owners are under 25, double the UK average Technically, anyone can cut or colour hair in the UK as the industry is not regulated but the vast majority will get a National Vocation Qualification (NVQ), either via college or an apprenticeship. Foundation level hairdressing apprentices - the most basic training level - fell in Wales from 625 in 2012-13, to 375 in 2017-18. Ken Picton said if you worked hard and had the right training the industry could have endless opportunities Mr Picton, president of the Fellowship for British Hairdressing, has worked with stars including Kate Moss and Tina Turner. But he worries some people think  of it as an ""easy job"" or a fast way to become a celebrity. ""There's a real art to hairdressing - it's not just about cutting hair - and that takes time and a lot of education,"" he said. Mr Picton said some thought the industry was ""unintelligent"" and attitudes towards creative industries needed to change. ""Sadly these days [children's] intelligence is judged on academic results, at no point are they judged on their social skills or their creativity."" RayJay says her training never ends as she is always learning about new techniques and products Apprentice Holly Jenkins, 17, from Cardiff, did well in her GCSEs and planned to go to sixth form to study maths, psychology and English before going to university. She applied for a place in Mr Picton's salon after falling in love with hairdressing during a summer job. ""[Teachers] only talk about your maths jobs, English jobs, they don't talk about creative jobs or where you could end up,"" she said. Megan Thomas has been training for three years and said it was hard work but very rewarding Megan Thomas, 19, was ""persuaded"" by teachers and friends to go to college - but after three months she realised she could learn on the job and left. ""I just went to school and then went to college afterwards, because that's what all my friends were doing. It just wasn't for me,"" she said. Now qualified, Megan said people had a misconception hairdressing was ""easy"", but said she worked long hours and it was challenging. Artistic senior stylist at Yume salon, Rachel Emanuel, known as RayJay, said she never stops learning, but had clients who said they would not want their children to be a hairdresser. ""I've had people say 'It's just cutting hair, how hard can it be?' or 'is that what you have chosen or something you've had to do, because you didn't get the grades?'""

"Frequent rock-falls have added risks for mountaineers in many regions Mountaineering in some parts of the world is becoming riskier because of climate change, climbing experts and scientists warn. They say warming in the Alps has thinned ice and snow cover, resulting into frequent rock-falls and landslides. Their concerns were voiced at a meeting of the International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation this week. Melting glaciers have also added challenges for mountaineers. Climbing routes have either had to be abandoned or changed because of the increased risks. In some places, climbing seasons have had to be brought forward. A study of mountaineering plans for climbers in the Mont Blanc massif showed numerous changes. Almost all climbing ""itineraries"" for the region had been affected since the 1970s and a few routes no longer existed. In the journal Arctic, Antarctic and Alpine Research,external, Jacques Mourey from the University of Grenoble Alpes and colleagues wrote: ""Moreover, periods during which these itineraries can be climbed in good conditions in summer have tended to become less predictable and periods of optimal conditions have shifted toward spring and fall, because the itineraries have become more dangerous and technically more challenging."" A 2017 study of several summits in the Mont Blanc massif,externalby a French team showed significant degradation of permafrost between 1850 and 2015. This led to the slopes becoming unstable, causing rockfalls. Climbers say thinning glaciers and snow cover have also made climbing difficult Findings from a study in the Austrian Alps,externalhave been similar. ""Many of these routes have become extremely dangerous,"" Florian Ritter, from the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences in Vienna, and colleagues wrote recently in the journal BioOne Complete. ""Numerous classical ice climbs in the Eastern Alps have become heavily affected by rockfall and falling stones, as well due to rocks melting out at the ice margins... during late summer and autumn."" The Austrian research also pointed to other factors. ""While the described processes related to global warming might increase the potential, events are generally triggered by other processes that are less linked to global warming, such as extreme rain events,"" it said. Analysis of guidebooks written for those climbing in the Bernese Alps, Switzerland, confirms the changes. ""In the climbing guides, multiple generations of climbers noted the climbing dangers for whole mountain ranges,"" said co-author Arnaud Tremme, a geographer with Wageningen University in the Netherlands. ""The oldest guide out of the dozens of guides used in the research was written 146 years ago, this allowed us to record the changes for a longer period and link these with climate change."" For the past 10 years, a network of wireless sensors on Mount Matterhorn in the Alps has been streaming data on the condition of steep rock faces, permafrost and prevailing climate. ""Based on the data we have received, we see that the rate of change is quite fast,"" said Jan Beutel, a Zurich-based researcher, who leads the monitoring project. ""As a result, some of the places can't be visited anymore."" A study on Aoraki Mount Cook in New Zealand also highlighted difficulties for climbers. Climbers here have to navigate the Tasman Glacier, but this is now becoming more difficult because it's melting. ""One of the interesting results of our study was the spatial variability associated with climate change - the impacts are greater at lower elevations, but much higher on the mountains. Because of the large seasonal snowfall, the effects are somewhat buffered,"" Heather Purdie, one of the authors of a study on the mountain told the BBC. Crevasses are becoming difficult to cross in some mountainous regions Mountain guides say routes are now becoming more challenging and they have had to adapt. ""Rockfalls are becoming the biggest challenge,"" says Christian Trommsdorff, president of the International Federation of Mountain Guides Associations. ""Although impacts of the changing climate differ; on some mountains they are massive, while on others they are not."" Professional mountaineers in the US say some peaks in the Pacific Northwest that still have glaciated terrain have become increasingly hazardous. In some cases, it is no longer possible for mountaineers to climb them. ""The combination of crevasses becoming un-crossable, overhead icefall hazard increasing and rockfall events occurring regularly has made many classic routes more dangerous and less predictable,"" said Angela Hawse, president of the American Mountain Guides Association. Although few studies along these lines have been conducted in the Himalayas, mountain guides in the region say climbing is becoming riskier. They say wearing crampons on thin ice and exposed rocks is particularly dangerous. ""It becomes like wearing (ladies') high heels on a marble surface,"" says Tshering Pande Bhote, vice president with the Nepal Mountain Guides Association. ""When there is enough snow and ice, the crampons get their grip but now that is becoming less and less available."" Exposed rocks on mountains are prone to crumble and fall Nepalese mountain guides say that widening crevasses are also becoming a threat. ""We have noticed that the gaping of crevasses, mainly underneath the surface, are increasing and it appears that is happening because of accelerated melting,"" said Mr Bhote. A number of studies in the Himalayas, mainly in the Everest region, have shown that glaciers there are fast retreating. The Khumbu glacier, that Everest climbers must cross before their ascent, has seen several ponds forming on it and joining up because of its rapid melt. The annual meeting of the International Federation of Climbing and Mountaineering in Cyprus will also be discussing how to operate in the changing circumstances. Mr Trommsdorff agreed that the changing nature of different routes needed to be included in training mountain guides. ""We are starting to do something in this regard but we need more of research and development support,"" he said. ""But we also adapt very well to such changes.""

"This video can not be played The moment US House votes for impeachment inquiry The US House of Representatives has passed a resolution to formally proceed with the impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump. The measure details how the inquiry will move into a more public phase. It was not a vote on whether the president should be removed from office. This was the first test of support in the Democratic-controlled House for the impeachment process. The White House condemned the vote, which passed along party lines. Only two Democrats - representing districts that Mr Trump won handily in 2016 - voted against the resolution, along with all Republicans, for a total count of 232 in favour and 196 against. The resolution also sets out due process rights for Mr Trump's lawyers under the congressional inquiry. The Republican president is accused of trying to pressure Ukraine into investigating unsubstantiated corruption claims against his political rival, Joe Biden, and his son who worked with Ukrainian gas company Burisma. Mr Trump denies wrongdoing. The impeachment story explained Who's who in Trump whistleblower story? What Trump's Ukraine phone call really means Republicans have criticised Democrats for the closed hearings - in which Republican lawmakers have also taken part. But Democrats insist they were needed to gather evidence ahead of the public stage of the investigation, and deny allegations they have been secretive. The resolution moves the inquiry to a new phase, which could eventually see articles of impeachment recommended against Mr Trump. If that happened, and the House voted to pass the articles, a trial would be held in the Senate. Republicans have been clamouring for weeks for the Democrats to hold a full vote that will formalise the impeachment inquiry in the House of Representatives. Now they got one. It won't alter the dynamic in Washington, however. Republicans will continue to object to what they see as an unfair process with a preordained result. Democrats will push ahead with an investigation that they always intended would culminate in dramatic public hearings and (perhaps) an impeachment vote. This doesn't mean that Thursday's proceedings are meaningless, however. For the first time since 1998, the House is taking a significant step toward impeaching a president. The resolution gives the public some idea what to expect in the days ahead - including lots of Intelligence Committee sparring between Democrats and Republicans, a look at the transcripts from some of the high-profile witness depositions already conducted and, at some point, a formal report that could serve as the basis of articles of impeachment. It's not exactly uncharted territory in US history, but the course being set leads toward a historic clash with the presidency at stake. In the first stage, the House Intelligence Committee will hold public hearings in the coming weeks. It will have the right to make public transcripts of depositions taken in private. This video can not be played Trump impeachment: Last week was the most dramatic so far In the second stage, a public report on the findings will be sent to the House Judiciary Committee which will conduct its own proceedings and report on ""such resolutions, articles of impeachment, or other recommendations as it deems proper"". President Trump's lawyers will be allowed to take part in the Judiciary Committee stage. Republicans will be able to subpoena documents or witnesses although they could still be blocked as both panels are controlled by Democrats. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who is the most senior elected Democrat, said the procedures would allow lawmakers to decide whether to impeach Trump ""based on the truth"". ""I don't know why the Republicans are afraid of the truth,"" she added. But House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy argued that Democrats are trying to remove Trump ""because they are scared they cannot defeat him at the ballot box"" in next year's presidential election. White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement: ""Speaker Pelosi and the Democrats have done nothing more than enshrine unacceptable violations of due process into House rules.""

At the heart of the investigation, which was announced by Mrs Pelosi last month, is a phone call on 25 July between Mr Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the impeachment inquiry last month A rough transcript of the call shows Mr Trump asking for an investigation into the Bidens. Joe Biden is a frontrunner in the race for the Democratic nomination ahead of next year's presidential election. The call was the subject of a complaint by a whistleblower, whose identity has been closely protected by lawmakers. This video can not be played What does it take to impeach a president? Tim Morrison, who served as top adviser on Russia and Europe at the National Security Council, has testified to lawmakers. He was one of the officials authorised to listen in on Mr Trump's call with the president of Ukraine. The aide corroborated last week's testimony by Bill Taylor, the top US diplomat in Ukraine, that Mr Trump had tried to use his office to prod Ukraine into investigating Mr Biden. But Mr Morrison, who stepped down on Wednesday, also told the committee: ""I want to be clear, I was not concerned that anything illegal was discussed."" Meanwhile,House investigators have invited former US National Security Adviser John Bolton to testifyon 7 November. Mr Bolton's lawyer said his client was not willing to appear voluntarily. No subpoena requiring him to testify has been issued so far. Mr Bolton had angrily referred to alleged White House political pressure on Ukraine as ""a drug deal"", according to US media.

"About 7% of children have food allergies, according to King's College London The number of children who received hospital treatment for allergies has increased by 65% across England in the past five years, figures have revealed. In 2013-14, 2,873 teenagers sought treatment whereas in 2017-18 it was 4,743, data from NHS Digital shows. Allergy UK said this could be because this was the age when sufferers started taking responsibility for themselves. There have been calls for the government to introduce legislation on how schools should manage allergies. The figures from NHS Digital, released to BBC London under the Freedom of Information Act, also showed the number of children treated for anaphylactic shock increased by 41% in the past five years. For teenagers, the increase was 36% while for those aged 19 and over, it increased by 10%. Common foods children can be allergic to include shellfish and peanuts Amena Warner, head of clinical services for Allergy UK, said one reason why more teenagers were receiving treatment was because at that age, allergy sufferers started to move away from parental control. She said teenagers might not question food the same way as parents did and may not read food labels in detail, while sufferers might also be more inclined to seek hospital treatment because they had more awareness about what happened during a reaction. Dr Paul Turner, a consultant in Paediatric Allergy and Immunology at Imperial College London, said risk-taking or a lack of self-confidence in managing food allergies was ""almost certainly a factor in the increase in non-fatal anaphylaxis in this age group"". This video can not be played Karanbir Cheema died in hospital 11 days after he had a severe reaction to cheese Food allergies affect about 7% of children in the UK, according to Kings College London. Schoolboy Karanbir Cheema died in 2017 after he had asevere reaction to cheese that was thrown at him while he was at school. Following an inquest, the coroner said it was ""vital"" allergy action plans were standardised in hospitals and schools. Why the world is becoming more allergic Peanut-allergy therapy 'protection not a cure' 'I avoid kissing girls because it could kill me' However, allergy specialist Prof Adam Fox said he was seeing a lot of occasions when schools seemed to be failing families. ""In the most extreme cases, parents seem to be genuinely frightened to send them to a school where they don't feel safe,"" said Prof Fox, a paediatric allergist at Evelina London children's hospital. Jenna Laing-Phillips, whose 10-year-old son Stanley has severe allergies, said it could be ""overwhelming because you spend every day thinking about minimising risks"". ""Food is the easy bit in a way, but then you do have to think about the surfaces he's touching, the handles he might be touching. These are the issues we had at school, they don't get it... the risk of cross contamination is huge."" She took Stanley out of his old school in Surrey, saying she believed it did not have proper safeguards in place to protect him, but the school denied the claim and said safeguarding was its ""top priority"". It also said there were no recorded incidents of an allergic reaction by Stanley while he was in the care of the school. ""What we want to know is that our kids are safe in school and that they've done everything they can to minimise the risk and if something was to happen, the school will know what to do because actually they have clear legislation to follow,"" Ms Laing-Phillips said. She launched a petition calling for the introduction of statutory allergy legislation. In its response,external, the government said it considered the ""existing legislation combined with statutory guidance to be sufficient"". There are calls for schools to have clear guidance on how to look after those with allergies All primary and secondary schools in the UK are able to buy adrenaline auto-injectors without a prescription for use in emergencies but some have called for more guidance from the government. At Crowthorne Church of England Primary School in Berkshire, lunch boxes are checked by staff while photos and care plans have been put in place for every child with a food allergy. Every member of staff has also been trained to use an EpiPen. But head teacher Ruth Jackson said better guidance from the government would be reassuring. ""It would be good for head teachers to know what good practice is and to make sure that they are following it because ultimately what every head teacher wants is to make sure they're doing the best for every child,"" she said. The Department for Education said it was ""clear that children with medical conditions should be properly supported to enjoy a full education and be safe at school"". ""All schools are required to make arrangements that ensure this is the case,"" a spokesperson said.

"This video can not be played Donald Trump criticises Boris Johnson's Brexit deal Donald Trump has criticised Boris Johnson's Brexit deal with the EU, saying it restricts the US's ability to do future trade with the UK. Speaking to LBC,external, he said that, without the deal, the two countries could ""do many times the numbers"" than now. The US president also took a swipe at Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, saying he would be ""so bad"" as prime minister. Mr Corbyn accused him of ""trying to interfere"" in the UK general election to boost ""his friend Boris Johnson"". The UK is officially going to the polls on 12 December after the early election bill became law when it was given royal assent on Thursday. It follows a further delay to the UK's departure from the EU, to 31 January 2020. What is in Boris Johnson's new Brexit deal? Jeremy Corbyn vows to 'transform' UK Could US companies run NHS services after Brexit? Farage refuses to rule out withdrawing candidates In August, Mr Trumppromised a ""very big trade deal""with the UK and predicted that leaving the EU would be like losing ""an anchor round the ankle"". But speaking to friend and supporter Nigel Farage on LBC, Mr Trump was critical of the withdrawal agreement Mr Johnson recently reached with EU leaders. Mr Trump told LBC: ""We want to do trade with UK and they want to do trade with us. ""To be honest with you... this deal... under certain aspects of the (Brexit) deal... you can't do it, you can't do it, you can't trade. ""We can't make a trade deal with the UK because I think we can do many times the numbers that we're doing right now and certainly much bigger numbers than you are doing under the European Union."" by Jessica Parker, BBC political correspondent Diplomatic norms dictate that leaders don't wade into the electoral events of other countries. But of course this isn't the first time that an American president has decided to cross that particular transatlantic channel. During the 2016 referendum, Barack Obama said that Brexit would put the UK at the ""back of the queue"" for trade deals. In June, Donald Trump offered his views on the Conservative leadership contest. Now, in this fairly wide-ranging discussion, he's talked about both Boris Johnson's Brexit deal and Jeremy Corbyn's suitability for the role of PM. But the Labour leader doesn't appear too put out - even retweeting the relevant part of the interview. The truth is that Mr Corbyn is more than OK with putting some distance between himself and Donald Trump; the US President isn't exactly a poster boy for socialism. And while his comments on the implications of Boris Johnson's Brexit deal on US-UK trade may cause Downing Street some discomfort, some mystery surrounds exactly where Mr Trump believes difficulties may arise as he didn't elaborate. The prime minister aims to get his deal through Parliament if he wins the general election. However, Mr Trump also praised Mr Johnson as ""the exact right guy for the times"". In response, a Downing Street spokesman said Mr Johnson's Brexit deal with the EU ""ensures that we take back control of our laws, trade, borders and money"". ""Under this new deal, the whole of the UK will leave the EU customs union, which means we can strike our own free trade deals around the world from which every part of the UK will benefit."" Donald Trump has often praised Boris Johnson in recent months Mr Trump also said Mr Farage, who leads the Brexit Party and is planning to stand in the general election, and Mr Johnson should ""get together"" to create ""an unstoppable force"" in UK politics. The president, who has previously expressed his backing for Brexit, added: ""And Corbyn would be so bad for your country, so bad. He'd take you in such a bad way. He'd take you into such bad places. ""But your country has tremendous potential. It's a great country."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Corbyn and Mr Johnson are battling it out for the keys to 10 Downing Street, with the Conservative leader promising to get the UK out of the EU as soon as possible, and the Labour leader promising another referendum. Kicking off Labour's general election campaign, Mr Corbyn earlier warned a post-Brexit trade deal with Mr Trump's administration would give US companies greater access to the NHS, and allow them to profit from it at UK taxpayers' expense. The prime minister's planned agreement, he said, would ""mean yet more NHS money taken away from patients and handed to shareholders."" However, Mr Trump dismissed the Labour leader's claim, saying: ""Not at all. We wouldn't even be involved in that, no. ""It's not for us to have anything to do with your health care system. No, we're just talking about trade."" The UK government has said that, under any future trade deal with the US, it wants protections for the NHS. Elsewhere, Mr Johnson blamed Mr Corbyn for the delay to Brexit. He said he was ""incredibly frustrated"" that the 31 October deadline had to be extended, but a Conservative election win would remove the ""logjam"". Both leaders, and those of other parties, are beginning six weeks of campaigning. It comes as John Bercow's 10-year reign as Speaker of the House of Commons came to an end.

"This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""Whose side are you on?"" Jeremy Corbyn vowed to ""transform"" Britain by taking on ""the few who run a corrupt system"" as he kicked off Labour's election campaign. The party leader promised to ""rebuild"" public services and hit out at ""tax dodgers, dodgy landlords, bad bosses and big polluters"". In a speech, Mr Corbyn called the 12 December poll a ""once-in-a-generation chance to transform our country"". But Prime Minister Boris Johnson blamed Mr Corbyn for the delay to Brexit. He said he was ""incredibly frustrated"" that the 31 October deadline had to be extended, but a Conservative election win would remove the ""logjam"".

A really simple guide to the UK general election Corbyn challenges Johnson to election TV debate Your questions answered: Could snow delay the vote? In a speech at Battersea Arts Centre, south London, Mr Corbyn received loud cheers from supporters when he said Labour would launch ""the biggest people-powered campaign in history"". After Jeremy Corbyn mentioned the NHS, Labour supporters chanted: ""Not for sale."" Flanked by members of the shadow cabinet, he said: ""You know what really scares the elite? What they're actually afraid of is paying their taxes. So in this election they'll fight harder and dirtier than ever before. They'll throw everything at us because they know we're not afraid to take them on. ""So we're going after the tax dodgers. We're going after the dodgy landlords. We're going after the bad bosses. We're going after the big polluters. Because we know whose side we're on."" The December election was called for by the prime minister  and is taking place after Mr Corbyn agreed to it, following the EU's decision to delay Brexit. The Labour leader told the audience that, if elected prime minister, he would ""open negotiations with the EU about a sensible relationship with Europe"". This wasn't exactly a pitch for the centre ground by Jeremy Corbyn. His tone was uncompromising. It's designed in part - just like in 2017 - to enthuse younger voters and previous non-voters, convincing them that politics can make a difference. But he is also searching for a message that might appeal beyond Brexit - to potential Labour voters in both Leave and Remain areas. Labour launched its election campaign in the London seat of Battersea. It doggedly campaigned here in 2017, and won narrowly - it now leads the Conservatives by just 2,416 votes. It's a reminder that the party will have to work hard to defend seats - as well as targets held by its opponents. Read Iain's blog Mr Corbyn also said: ""The prime minister wants you to believe that we're having this election because Brexit is being blocked by an establishment elite. ""People aren't fooled so easily. They know the Conservatives are the establishment elite."" The lighter side of the (former) Brexit deadline Twitter to ban all political advertising Mr Corbyn also said the NHS was ""not for sale"" and that any future trade deal with the US should not involve giving American firms greater access to it. The audience, made up of Labour supporters, then repeatedly chanted: ""Not for sale."" This video can not be played Corbyn: ""Our NHS is not for sale"" Several times he asked the audience: ""Whose side are you on?"" They replied: ""Yours."" Mr Corbyn said the prime minister had thought he was being ""smart"" in calling for an election in December, and thought that Labour supporters ""won't go out to vote"". ""Even if the rivers freeze over, we're going out to bring about real change for the many, not the few,"" he added.

She told the BBC the UK was in a ""very volatile political situation"" and anything could happen on 12 December. Ms Swinson said the Lib Dems could find ""arrangements"" with other parties in a ""small number of seats"" to give an anti-Brexit candidate the best chance of winning. It could see candidates standing aside in areas where their Remain-supporting rivals have a better chance of winning.
