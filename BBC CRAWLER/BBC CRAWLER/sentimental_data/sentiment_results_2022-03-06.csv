"Successive US presidents have struggled to get the measure of Vladimir Putin but now that Brussels and Berlin have joined the fray with such resolve, it's a different story, writes Nick Bryant. It is often tempting to look upon Vladimir Putin as the millennium bug in a human and deadly form. The Russian president rose to power on 31 December 1999, as the world held its breath that computers would go into meltdown when the clock struck midnight, unable to process the change from 1999 to 2000. In the 20 years since, Putin has been trying to engineer a different kind of global system malfunction, the destruction of the liberal international order. The former KGB spymaster wanted to turn back the clock: to revive Russia's tsarist greatness and to restore the might and menace of the Soviet Union prior to its break-up in 1991. This Russian revanchist has become the most disruptive international leader of the 21st Century, the mastermind behind so much misery from Chechnya to Crimea, from Syria to the cathedral city of Salisbury. He has sought - successfully at times - to redraw the map of Europe. He has tried - successfully at times - to immobilise the United Nations. He has been determined - successfully at times - to weaken America, and hasten its division and decline. Follow the latest updates from inside Ukraine Putin came to power at a moment of western hubris. The United States was the sole superpower in a unipolar world. Francis Fukuyama's End of History thesis, proclaiming the triumph of liberal democracy, was widely accepted. Some economists even peddled the theory that recessions would be no more, partly because of the productivity gains of the new digital economy. It was also thought that globalisation, and the interdependence it wrought, would stop major economic powers fighting wars. The same utopianism attached itself to the internet, which was seen overwhelmingly as a force for global good. An honour guard greets Air Force One on the Moscow tarmac in 2002 In the early days especially, the same misplaced optimism and wishful thinking coloured the west's approach to Putin - a figure, it is now obvious, who was trying to buck history and thwart democratisation, however many lives were lost in the process. Successive US presidents have played into his hands. Bill Clinton, the occupant of the White House when Putin came to power, handed this ultra-nationalist a popular grievance by pushing for the expansion of Nato right up to Russia's borders. As George F Kennan, the famed architect of America's Cold War strategy of containment, warned at the time: ""Expanding Nato would be the most fateful error of America policy in the entire post-Cold War era."" Why Biden won't send troops to Ukraine George W Bush completely misjudged his Russian counterpart. ""I looked the man in the eye,"" Bush famously said after their first meeting in Slovenia in 2001. ""I found him very straightforward and trustworthyâ¦ I was able to get a sense of his soul."" Bush mistakenly thought he could mount a charm offensive with Putin, and gently cajole him further down the democratic path. But even though Bush visited Russia more than any other country - including, as a personal favour, two trips in 2002 to Putin's home city, St Petersburg - the Russian leader was already displaying dangerously despotic tendencies. In 2008, Bush's final year as president, Putin invaded Georgia - what he called a ""peace enforcement operation"". The Kremlin argued then - and has continued to argue ever since - that it was hypocritical for Washington to complain about this violation of international law after Bush had invaded Iraq. George Bush hosted Vladimir Putin at his Texas ranch... ...which caused some excitement locally Barack Obama sought to reframe US-Russian relations. His first secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, even handed her Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov a mock reset button (which was mistakenly labelled with the Russian word for ""overloaded""). But Putin knew that America, after its long wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, no longer wanted to police the world. When Obama refused in 2013 to enforce his red-line warning against Bashar al-Assad when the Syrian dictator used chemical weapons against his own people, Putin saw a green light. By helping Assad carry out his murderous war, he extended Moscow's sphere of influence in the Middle East when the United States wanted to extract itself from the region. The following year, he annexed Crimea, and established a foothold in eastern Ukraine. Despite being told by Obama to ""cut it out,"" Putin even sought to influence the outcome of the 2016 presidential election in the hope that Hillary Clinton, a long-time nemesis, would be defeated and that Donald Trump, a long-time fan boy, would win. The New York property tycoon made no secret of his admiration for Putin, a sycophantic approach that seems to have further emboldened the Russian president. Much to Moscow's delight, Trump publicly criticised Nato, weakened the US post-war alliance system and became such a polarising figure that he left America more politically divided than at any time since the Civil War. LIVE:Latest updates from on the ground IN KYIV:Locals fear another Grozny or Aleppo EXPLAINED:Why Putin has invaded Ukraine? IN DEPTH:Full coverage of the conflict Arguably, then, you have to reach back 30 years to find a US leader whose approach to the Kremlin has stood the test of time. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, George Herbert Walker Bush resisted the temptation to rejoice in America's Cold War victory - much to the astonishment of the White House press pack, he refused to travel to Berlin for a victory lap - knowing that it would bolster hardliners in the Politburo and military seeking to oust Mikhail Gorbachev. That magnanimity in victory helped when it came to bringing about the reunification of Germany, which was arguably Bush's greatest foreign policy success. Putin is obviously a more formidable adversary, harder to deal with than even Leonid Brezhnev or Nikita Khrushchev, the Soviet premier during the Cuban Missile Crisis. But since the turn of the century no US president has truly had his measure. Bill Clinton pushed for the expansion of Nato which some said was a mistake Joe Biden, like George Herbert Walker Bush, is a Cold War warrior, who has dedicated his presidency to defending democracy at home and abroad. Seeking to re-establish America's traditional post-war role as the leader of the free world, he has sought to mobilise the international community, offered military aid to Ukraine and adopted the toughest sanction regime ever targeted against Putin. As Russian forces amassed at the border, he also shared US intelligence showing that Putin had decided to invade, in ways that sought to disrupt the Kremlin's usual misinformation campaigns and false flag operations. His State of the Union address became a rallying cry. ""Freedom will always triumph over tyranny,"" he said. And while Biden does not speak with the clarity or force of a Kennedy or a Reagan, it was nonetheless a significant speech. What's been striking since the Russian invasion started, however, has been the assertion of forceful presidential leadership from elsewhere. Volodymyr Zelensky has been lauded and lionised, as he has continued this extraordinary personal journey from comedian to Churchillian colossus. Zelensky: A comedian president rising to the moment In Brussels, the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has been another commanding presence. This former German politician has been a driving force behind the decision, for the first time in EU history, to finance and purchase weapons for a nation under attack, a commitment that includes not just ammunition but fighter jets as well. Ursula von der Leyen Her compatriot, the new Chancellor of Germany Olaf Scholz, has also shown more resolve in dealing with Putin than his predecessor Angela Merkel. At warp speed, he has overturned decades of post-Cold War German foreign policy, an approach so often predicated on caution and timidity towards the Russian leader. Berlin has sent anti-tank and anti-aircraft systems to Ukraine (ending the policy of not sending weapons to active war zones), halted the Nord Stream 2 Baltic Sea gas pipeline project, withdrawn its opposition to blocking Russia from the SWIFT international payments system, and even committed to spending 2% of its GDP on defence spending. Putin's war prompts dramatic German U-turn The biggest assault on a European state since World War Two has stiffened European resolve. But so, too, it seems has the relative weakness of America. Mindful of the botched US withdrawal from Afghanistan and possibility of a Trump 2.0 presidency, European leaders seem to have realised that they can no longer lean so heavily on Washington to defend democracy in this hour of maximum peril. Leadership of the free world has, in this crisis, become a common endeavour. Even since the end of the Cold War, Washington has been calling upon European nations to do more to police its own neighbourhood, something they failed to do when the break-up of the former Yugoslavia sparked the Bosnian war. Historians may well conclude that it took a combination of Putin's aggressiveness, America's fragility, Ukraine's heroic resolve and the fear that Europe's post-war stability is truly on the line to finally make that happen. This video can not be played Watch: What Americans think of Biden's Ukraine response It would be naive to be swept away by the romanticism of Zelensky's speeches or to succumb to the dopamine high of watching the seizure of Russian-owned super-yachts unfold on social media. Putin is intensifying the war. But the last week has sent a message to Moscow - and to Beijing as well - that the post-war international order still continues to function, despite the deployment of the Russian war machine to bring about its collapse. Just as history never ended, nor has liberal democracy. As Joe Biden put it in his State of the Union, during a passage in which rhetoric served also as sober analysis: Putin ""thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead, he met a wall of resistance he never imagined"". Nick Bryant is the author of When America Stopped Being Great: a history of the present.

"Katrin on holiday in happier times. She found her social media awash with fake posts after the invasion began What's it like being a young Ukrainian experiencing war while wading through chaos and misinformation on social media? 24-year-old Katrin awoke in Kyiv last Thursday to the sound of an explosion - and soon enough found her social media feed awash with distressing posts. ""The first thing we had to do was to pack and go to the basement,"" she tells me, now safe in her small hometown outside of Lviv where she escaped with her boyfriend, neighbours and their dogs. ""But right after we went down, I started scrolling Instagram. And it was all on my Instagram stories and my posts."" She wasn't just seeing scary, factual posts from friends, but false information - including comments on TikTok from accounts that claimed the war ""wasn't real"" or that it was a ""hoax"". ""After I blocked this one account, another sprung up with a profile picture of a different girl, writing to me in Russian,"" Katrin says. The trolls have been prolific - and they have been interacting with young women across Ukraine. Alina, 18, found herself in a total panic after seeing posts in Russian suggesting that her neighbourhood in Zaporizhzhya in south-east Ukraine was about to be shelled and destroyed. But the rumours were false. Screengrabs of messages in Russia falsely claiming that an attack was imminent on Alina's town Alina spoke to me from her bedroom, exhausted after nights of air raids and sheltering. She says that rumours moved rapidly on chat app Telegram, spread by people apparently setting out to cause panic. ""Russians specifically find our chats and write that something is exploding. Someone writes that there is a sign of a bomb in the area - then others refute the information,"" she says. Alina pictured last summer in Ukraine Another video she saw on Telegram suggested there had been an explosion at the airport in her hometown. It turned out to be a different explosion, in the nearby city of Mariupol. A video shared with false claims that there was an explosion in Alina's hometown Old footage from other conflicts, including the massive blast in Beirut in 2020, has also been shared widely - including on TikTok, where clips have racked up millions of views. Marta is 20 years old and was stuck in the UK where she was visiting friends when the war broke out. She says she's seen videos from Syria and Iraq. ""But they posted them as 'Ukraine',"" she says. She says videos on TikTok's For You Page - the main gateway into the video-sharing app - have left her terrified and angry, as she desperately worries for friends and family back home. LIVE:Latest updates from on the ground IN KYIV:Locals fear another Grozny or Aleppo ANALYSIS:Europe finally steps up EXPLAINED:Why Putin has invaded Ukraine? IN DEPTH:Full coverage All three women have found themselves battling accounts posting comments in support of Russia. The videos posted by one of the pro-Russian accounts Jess promoting false claims about the war in Ukraine. ""Some of them started to post videos, they started to call Ukraine 'liars',"" Marta says. Some were blaming Ukraine for the violence, writing ""glory to Russia"" - and others falsely suggested that the war was somehow staged. ""Every time I decided to take a look at those accounts, they were a profile with zero followers, zero likes, zero following, with a profile picture of a Russian flag or something,"" Marta says. Many of the TikTok accounts that the women shared with me appear to have lifted photos from other accounts online. Like Marta says, they have few or no followers, and they don't use their real names - or use generic usernames. Marta has been battling pro-Russian trolls online One I looked at used the name ""Jess"" and had just one follower. The only videos on the account are ones first shared just days ago, indicating that the account was created very recently. Almost all of the videos the account did share featured debunked and false claims: that a woman who was injured during a Russian attack was an actor, that news coverage is filled with footage of old conflicts, and even that the war somehow isn't happening. One account Katrin ended up arguing with on TikTok again had few followers - its profile image appears to be copied from the Pinterest page of a Korean woman. None of the accounts have responded to my attempts to get in touch - so it's hard to tell who is running them. Russia has created inauthentic accounts before to push messages and sow division. But it's also possible that the accounts are run by real people who believe false claims. Misinformation is a problem social media companies have been grappling with for some time. Now their policies are coming under fresh scrutiny. Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, along with Twitter and Google, have all announced commitments to tackle false information and propaganda around the war in Ukraine. But it's apps like Telegram and TikTok - used a lot by young Ukrainians - is where much of this disinformation continues to proliferate. TikTok told the BBC it has ""increased resources to respond to emerging trends and remove violative content, including harmful misinformation and promotion of violence."" Telegram did not respond to our request for comment. It's clear that what's happening online is causing even more panic and pain in the real world. ""We are scared by those who create this fake information,"" Alina tells me, ready to head yet again down to the basement as the air raid siren rings out.

"Severe sanctions on Russia aim to isolate the country and create a deep recession there, but the economic fallout will also be felt by people around the world. The sharp rise in the prices of things from oil and metals to wheat is expected to push up the cost of many everyday items from food to petrol and heating. Russia is the world's largest natural gas exporter, which is vital for heating homes People in the UK and Europe are already paying high prices for energy and fuel. The Russia-Ukraine conflict has so far driven these even higher and caused the price of oil to jump to level in almost 14 years, while wholesale gas prices have more than doubled. If gas prices stay at that level,energy analysts have warnedthat household fuel bills in the UK could reach as much as Â£3,000 a year, whileaverage UK petrol prices have repeatedly hitrecord highs, with the latest price at 155p and diesel at 161p. Russia is the second-biggest exporter of crude oil, and the world's largest natural gas exporter, which is vital to heating homes, powering planes and filling cars with fuel. The UK gets only 6% of its crude oil and 5% of its gas from Russia, but the EU sources nearly half of its gas from the country. If one country reliant on Russian supplies receives less gas, they have to replace it, impacting the supplies of gas for other countries - that's why British energy prices and bills are still affected in a similar way to European ones. There are fears President Vladimir Putin might ""weaponise"" Russia's natural resources by reducing supplies of gas to Europe in response to sanctions. Politicians in Germany are calling for a ""national gas reserve"" to be created to protect consumers from price shocks. Meanwhile, the US is discussing a potential ban on buying Russian energy which has also fuelled price rises. Plane fuel is also linked to the price of crude oil andRyanair boss Michael O'Leary has warnedtickets for this summer will be higher than 2019, partly because of the rise in the price of oil. Tinned goods could rise further if aluminium prices remain high UK food producers don't import many items from Russia or Ukraine, but prices here may still rise because of an increase in associated costs, such as tinned cans and packaging and transport. Meanwhile, the cost of everyday food items might rise in places like Turkey and North Africa, which rely on wheat and corn from Ukraine and Russia. Both countries, once dubbed ""the breadbasket of Europe"", export about a quarter of the world's wheat and half of its sunflower products, like seeds and oil. Ukraine also sells a lot of corn globally. Analysts have warned that war could impact the production of grains and even double global wheat prices. More than 40% of Ukraine's wheat and corn exports went to the Middle East or Africa last year - and disruptions to supply could affect availability in these areas. The UK, by contrast, typically produces more than 90% of the wheat consumed in the country. But farmers here might find themselves paying more for fertiliser, which is one of Russia's biggest exports. Homeowners in the UK would see mortgage repayments rise if the Bank of England's base rate went up Inflation, which measures how fast the cost of living rises over time, hit 7.5% in January in the US - the highest level seen there since February 1982 - and rose by 5.5% in the UK. But oneeconomist has warned it could rise close to 10%in major Western economies if the cost of energy and food is pushed up by dwindling supplies cause by the Russian-Ukraine conflict. Such a figure might encourage the Bank of England and the US Federal Reserve to increase interest rates. The idea is that when borrowing is more expensive, people will have less money to spend. As a result, they will buy fewer things, and prices will stop rising as fast. But in the UK, for example, about 2.2 million homeowners with mortgages linked to the Bank of England's base rate would see repayments go up, putting further pressure on household budgets that are already being squeezed by the cost of living. Widespread falls in share prices, such as those triggered on Thursday, are likely to be bad news for pension savers Russian stocks crashed by as much as 45% in the wake of the Ukraine invasion with trading subsequently suspended, with banks and oil companies among the worst affected. It also led to steep falls on stock markets elsewhere around the world: in Europe the UK's FTSE 100 index has fallen over 6% since Russia crossed into Ukraine while Germany's Dax index is nearly 10% lower. Many people's reaction to stock market changes is that they are not directly affected, because they don't invest money in stocks and shares. But there are millions of people with a pension whose savings are invested in the stock market. If widespread falls in share prices are sustained then it's likely to be bad news for pension savers because the value of their savings pot is influenced by the performance of investments. Some investors or savers might look to protect their money or assets by moving them to traditional ""safe havens"", like gold, especially as the markets are likely to see more volatility as the crisis develops. But pension savings, like any investments, are usually a long-term bet and advisers say it's important not to panic about short-term movements up or down. Canned goods may become more expensive if metal price rises persist, the LME chief executive said As a leading commodities exporter, Russia is one of the world's largest suppliers of metals used in everything from aluminium cans, to copper wires, to car components, such as nickel, which is used in lithium-iron batteries, and palladium, which is used in catalytic converters. Everyday goods - which may seem far removed from the conflict - may rise as a result of it. ""When you buy your drinks can made of aluminium, or when you make renovations to your house and you need copper for your wiring, all of those prices do go into the overall inflationary pressure,""the boss of the London Metals Exchange has warned. If Vladimir Putin decided to cut off supplies of these metals in retaliation to sanctions, existing supply problems could worsen, with car firms having to find alternative sources. Russia is also home to manufacturing hubs for brands like Stellantis, Volkswagen and Toyota. Some production has already been paused at Russian car plants, while shipping and delivery companies halting activity to and from the country is likely to impact the availability of new cars.

"After fighting for his political survival last month, Boris Johnson is now spending time talking to a president at war In the last 10 days so much has changed. Europe's security has been shaken. Western leadership seems to have found an energy, a way of coming together that has been lacking in recent years. Night after night, the world watches as the Ukrainian people spoil and slow down Vladimir Putin's plans of drawing new lines on the map. Politicians here fret about how to help as much as humanly possible without crossing their own lines of putting their own servicemen and women into harm's way. They worry too about how the public will cope with changes that are on the way here too - changes that aren't dangerous, but will be difficult, ratcheting up pressure on prices and energy bills with no straightforward solutions around. Aninternational crisison this scale of course has consequences for our politics too. The prime minister - now spending his time on calls with the president of Ukraine, jetting to eastern Europe andtrying to broker Western action- was not so long ago trying to keep his own political head above water. Headlines about birthday cakes, police questionnaires, lockdown rules and cheese and wine have gone, and the agony abroad has totally changed the political environment for Boris Johnson. Most overtly the opposition has paused its repeated calls for him to quit. UK calls for renewed world effort to halt invasion Starmer calls for probe into PM Russian peer claim UK sanctions against some oligarchs may take weeks On Sunday morning, asked if he still believed that Mr Johnson should go, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: ""Look, at the moment the prime minister is obviously concentrating on the job in hand and we stand united as the United Kingdom on that issue."" The party claimed later they were not technically withdrawing their demand for him to go, but without doubt, this crisis has fundamentally changed the opposition and the government's priorities. February's frenzyseems a lifetime ago. The international crisis occupies the centre of government's time and most of Westminster's attention. The PM had, even before the invasion, moved to reboot his team after weeks of chaos. One Tory insider describes the changes as going from ""Operation Vote Leave, Operation Carrie, to Operation Staple Gun and Super Glue"", as staff were sacked and others brought in to do everything to keep him in Number 10. Now his focus, and that of Parliament and much of the public, is on Ukraine. The fury and anxiety about the parties in Downing Street and concern about Boris Johnson's handling of the saga is on hold - for now at least. Whatever their view of Boris Johnson, for the vast majority of Tories it is just not the time for a conversation about changing the leader. One minister says that anyone making public pronouncements about his leadership now would be ""off their rocker"". This stalwart defender says it has provided a ""distraction and a recalibration of thinking"" for those who wanted him gone. Some Tory MPs - and remember they are the ones who hold the power here - go further, seeing opportunity too in this crisis for Boris Johnson. That's not to suggest for a second that the government's priority is anything other than trying to improve this truly grave situation. One former minister says the Ukraine crisis ""massively strengthens him"", while another minister says that ""it is events that set the mood"", remarking: ""We've all seen campaigner Boris."" And some believe the prime minister is more comfortable as a politician in this kind of intense environment. ""It's his metier,"" one suggests, talking about a battle of international ideas rather than looking at spreadsheets or complicated domestic policy. In other words, appalling though this situation is, there's a belief that it could allow Mr Johnson to reinvent himself after a terribly stormy few months in office, where the consensus was spreading quickly in his party that he was the problem and not the solution to anything. Indeed, some feel more confident now about him being the person in charge. One cabinet minister, deeply worried about what's going, on told me: ""I'm not nervous because of him, I'm nervous because of the situation. I was nervous during the pandemic about what he would do."" Some of his more excitable MPs appear to have told Sunday newspapers this could be his ""Falklands moment"" - a reference to the war in 1982 that galvanised support for Margaret Thatcher, whose government had been struggling, paving the way for another election victory the following year. The parallels are far from exact and the comparison will rankle. But the political climate is transformed for now. Even one of the prime minister's spikiest critics, the former Tory minister Rory Stewart, said through gritted teeth:  ""I think he's a terrible human being. I think he's a terrible prime minister but I think he's done OK on the Ukraine crisis."" But while the brakes are truly on efforts to move Boris Johnson out of his job, the past can't be totally erased. One of those who was part of the disparate efforts to ease him out over the furore about Downing Street parties told me: ""We can't just put this in a box for six months - if you say it's just about a piece of cake that's one thing, but if you frame it as about breaking the law you made and lying to Parliament it's quite another."" It's not clear yet when the Met Police will conclude their inquiries, orwhen Sue Gray will publish her full report. Sources suggest they're on their way before Easter, but some of people due to be contacted by the police - the total is understood to be more than 80 - are yet to receive their questionnaires asking about their behaviour. The timing of when those investigations conclude and emerge into the public domain will matter enormously. When the headlines are full of Ukraine's agonies, the saga over parties seems trivial. Yet the police conclusions and Sue Gray's complete report still have the capacity to cause huge problems for Boris Johnson once again. One minister cautions that ""a deep disconnect has opened up between him and the public"", warning, if he is fined: ""What would you put on a leaflet if you are Labour?"". The urgency has gone from the questions about his survival but there are obstacles he has to navigate still. That minister says: ""His personal brand still is damaged"". The polls are still tricky for Conservatives. Like all politicians they may profess never to look at them, but they all do. Many Tory MPs look at the numbers and see discomfort not reassurance there. Hard numbers in the last few days meant the Labour Party held its seat in the Birmingham Erdington by-election too. It would be extraordinary if the Tories had grabbed that seat, which became vacant after the death of the hugely respected Labour MP Jack Dromey. But Labour also increased its vote share over the Tories, who had hoped to hold their 2019 level but slipped back. For a mid-term government, after the turmoil of recent months and calls for the prime minister to quit, it is far from a disastrous result. After the Birmingham Erdington by-election, local elections in May will provide the next test of Mr Johnson's popularity By-election results should be treated with care, they are a hint of what might come not a solid path. But translate the drop in support in Erdington into a hypothetical national result and the impact would be profound. Elections in May will provide another big test, and for Mr Johnson's critics a possible occasion to galvanise the attempt to oust him. And few at Westminster believe what lies ahead will be any easier for the government. Inflation, tax rises, and conflict in Europe provide an extremely difficult political landscape. The uncertainty around what happens next gives some of Boris Johnson's colleagues cause for profound concern. Several ministers have told me privately they believe that ultimately the might of the Russian military machine will overwhelm Ukraine. What seems like a united Western front may go from looking powerful in rhetoric, the initial response to Russian aggression, but may in time come to look powerless if the outcome goes terribly, terribly wrong. Tories must sack co-chair over Russia links - Labour Give Russia-linked Tory donations to charity - MP Starmer hails Birmingham by-election win Some in government worry about the public reaction if international outrage - from the PM's push to exclude Russia from the banking system, to BP offloading billions of pounds of Russian assets, to pub owners taking Russian vodka off the shelves - ends in a prolonged conflict with terrible loss of life that we all witness night after night on our phones and TV screens. The primary fear is what a cornered Vladimir Putin might do. There is a sense that nothing makes sense, nothing can be predicted, because he follows no logic that standard politicians would apply. But there is also a fear about how to manage public opinion and expectation at home as things develop. And the government's handling of the situation is not free from criticism either. Ministers emphasise how the UK pushed harder and faster for action to isolate Russia, whether from international finance, or the banking system, or providing crucial military support. But among the opposition and some Tory MPs too there is frustration at the speed of sanctions being applied to individuals. And there's embarrassment over the Conservative party's links to wealthy people of Russian origins, doubts resurfacing about theelevation of Evgeny Lebedev to the House of Lords. There are questions too about whether the UK is extending enough of a welcome to Ukrainians fleeing from danger. The home secretary has even been accused of showing a lack of humanity by her French opposite number. We've gone in a very short time from a Westminster saga that outraged swathes of the public, drove the Conservatives round the twist and threatened Boris Johnson's job, to a government seized with the gravity of an international crisis with a leader determined to play a leading role.

"A building on fire after a strike near the centre of Mariupol A ceasefire, and a chance for civilians to leave, was announced on Saturday morning in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol, where an estimated 200,000 people are trapped under heavy bombardment by Russian forces. The city arranged 50 buses, and many people travelled to the city centre to get them. But after less than two hours, Russia's army began shelling residential areas again, trapping civilians who had begun their escape. The city is now in its fifth day with no running water, no power, no sanitation, and food and water are fast running out. Maxim, a 27-year-old IT developer who is caring for his grandparents in their sixth-floor apartment, spoke to the BBC on Saturday night to describe a day that began with hope and ended in despair. We tried to escape today, during the planned time of no shooting. We heard we could get out. As fast as I could, I packed four bags for me and my grandparents with warm clothes and food, and all of our remaining water, and I packed them into my car. My grandparents are in their eighties, they cannot help. I carried everything down six flights of stairs to my car. There is no lift now. Right when I was ready to drive, the shelling started again. I heard explosions near to us. I carried everything back upstairs as fast as I could to the apartment. From there, I could see smoke rising from the city and smoke rising from the highway to Zaporizhzhia where people were supposed to escape. So I am still in my grandparents' apartment and the shelling and bombing has continued all day. But now instead of three of us here, there are nearly 20. Many people came into the city centre because they heard there was a ceasefire and buses to take them out, and to flee the shelling there. Then they could not get back to their shelters when it started again. So we have taken many people into the apartment. They are from the left side of the city, they say it is destroyed. All the houses are burning and no-one can put out the fires. There are many dead bodies lying in the streets and no-one can carry them. I know three of the people from before, from my neighbourhood, but the rest I do not know. The oldest is a woman in her late 70s, the youngest is a small child. We also have two cats, a parrot and a dog. We have tried to make space for the women and children to sleep on the floor. We don't have any extra mattresses but we have put some spare carpet and clothes on the floor for them to lie on. We have run out of bottled water. We are down to the water that I filled in the bath before the taps went off. The gas is the only thing still working - we can use it to boil the bath water to drink. Cramped conditions in Maxim's flat in Mariupol Today the police opened the stores and told people to take everything, because the people here have no food and drink. Our neighbours managed to take some candy, some fish and some fizzy drinks. The ceasefire was a lie. One side never planned to stop firing. If they say there is a ceasefire tomorrow [Sunday] we will have to try to go, but we don't know if it will be real. Maybe now we are better to hide. You can keep calling me as long as I have some battery left in my phone, but I don't know how long that will be. After today I am without hope. From now on we do what we have to each day only to survive and for our neighbours to survive. After that I don't know what comes next. We are very tired and we do not see a way out.

"After fighting for his political survival last month, Boris Johnson is now spending time talking to a president at war In the last 10 days so much has changed. Europe's security has been shaken. Western leadership seems to have found an energy, a way of coming together that has been lacking in recent years. Night after night, the world watches as the Ukrainian people spoil and slow down Vladimir Putin's plans of drawing new lines on the map. Politicians here fret about how to help as much as humanly possible without crossing their own lines of putting their own servicemen and women into harm's way. They worry too about how the public will cope with changes that are on the way here too - changes that aren't dangerous, but will be difficult, ratcheting up pressure on prices and energy bills with no straightforward solutions around. Aninternational crisison this scale of course has consequences for our politics too. The prime minister - now spending his time on calls with the president of Ukraine, jetting to eastern Europe andtrying to broker Western action- was not so long ago trying to keep his own political head above water. Headlines about birthday cakes, police questionnaires, lockdown rules and cheese and wine have gone, and the agony abroad has totally changed the political environment for Boris Johnson. Most overtly the opposition has paused its repeated calls for him to quit. UK calls for renewed world effort to halt invasion Starmer calls for probe into PM Russian peer claim UK sanctions against some oligarchs may take weeks On Sunday morning, asked if he still believed that Mr Johnson should go, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: ""Look, at the moment the prime minister is obviously concentrating on the job in hand and we stand united as the United Kingdom on that issue."" The party claimed later they were not technically withdrawing their demand for him to go, but without doubt, this crisis has fundamentally changed the opposition and the government's priorities. February's frenzyseems a lifetime ago. The international crisis occupies the centre of government's time and most of Westminster's attention. The PM had, even before the invasion, moved to reboot his team after weeks of chaos. One Tory insider describes the changes as going from ""Operation Vote Leave, Operation Carrie, to Operation Staple Gun and Super Glue"", as staff were sacked and others brought in to do everything to keep him in Number 10. Now his focus, and that of Parliament and much of the public, is on Ukraine. The fury and anxiety about the parties in Downing Street and concern about Boris Johnson's handling of the saga is on hold - for now at least. Whatever their view of Boris Johnson, for the vast majority of Tories it is just not the time for a conversation about changing the leader. One minister says that anyone making public pronouncements about his leadership now would be ""off their rocker"". This stalwart defender says it has provided a ""distraction and a recalibration of thinking"" for those who wanted him gone. Some Tory MPs - and remember they are the ones who hold the power here - go further, seeing opportunity too in this crisis for Boris Johnson. That's not to suggest for a second that the government's priority is anything other than trying to improve this truly grave situation. One former minister says the Ukraine crisis ""massively strengthens him"", while another minister says that ""it is events that set the mood"", remarking: ""We've all seen campaigner Boris."" And some believe the prime minister is more comfortable as a politician in this kind of intense environment. ""It's his metier,"" one suggests, talking about a battle of international ideas rather than looking at spreadsheets or complicated domestic policy. In other words, appalling though this situation is, there's a belief that it could allow Mr Johnson to reinvent himself after a terribly stormy few months in office, where the consensus was spreading quickly in his party that he was the problem and not the solution to anything. Indeed, some feel more confident now about him being the person in charge. One cabinet minister, deeply worried about what's going, on told me: ""I'm not nervous because of him, I'm nervous because of the situation. I was nervous during the pandemic about what he would do."" Some of his more excitable MPs appear to have told Sunday newspapers this could be his ""Falklands moment"" - a reference to the war in 1982 that galvanised support for Margaret Thatcher, whose government had been struggling, paving the way for another election victory the following year. The parallels are far from exact and the comparison will rankle. But the political climate is transformed for now. Even one of the prime minister's spikiest critics, the former Tory minister Rory Stewart, said through gritted teeth:  ""I think he's a terrible human being. I think he's a terrible prime minister but I think he's done OK on the Ukraine crisis."" But while the brakes are truly on efforts to move Boris Johnson out of his job, the past can't be totally erased. One of those who was part of the disparate efforts to ease him out over the furore about Downing Street parties told me: ""We can't just put this in a box for six months - if you say it's just about a piece of cake that's one thing, but if you frame it as about breaking the law you made and lying to Parliament it's quite another."" It's not clear yet when the Met Police will conclude their inquiries, orwhen Sue Gray will publish her full report. Sources suggest they're on their way before Easter, but some of people due to be contacted by the police - the total is understood to be more than 80 - are yet to receive their questionnaires asking about their behaviour. The timing of when those investigations conclude and emerge into the public domain will matter enormously. When the headlines are full of Ukraine's agonies, the saga over parties seems trivial. Yet the police conclusions and Sue Gray's complete report still have the capacity to cause huge problems for Boris Johnson once again. One minister cautions that ""a deep disconnect has opened up between him and the public"", warning, if he is fined: ""What would you put on a leaflet if you are Labour?"". The urgency has gone from the questions about his survival but there are obstacles he has to navigate still. That minister says: ""His personal brand still is damaged"". The polls are still tricky for Conservatives. Like all politicians they may profess never to look at them, but they all do. Many Tory MPs look at the numbers and see discomfort not reassurance there. Hard numbers in the last few days meant the Labour Party held its seat in the Birmingham Erdington by-election too. It would be extraordinary if the Tories had grabbed that seat, which became vacant after the death of the hugely respected Labour MP Jack Dromey. But Labour also increased its vote share over the Tories, who had hoped to hold their 2019 level but slipped back. For a mid-term government, after the turmoil of recent months and calls for the prime minister to quit, it is far from a disastrous result. After the Birmingham Erdington by-election, local elections in May will provide the next test of Mr Johnson's popularity By-election results should be treated with care, they are a hint of what might come not a solid path. But translate the drop in support in Erdington into a hypothetical national result and the impact would be profound. Elections in May will provide another big test, and for Mr Johnson's critics a possible occasion to galvanise the attempt to oust him. And few at Westminster believe what lies ahead will be any easier for the government. Inflation, tax rises, and conflict in Europe provide an extremely difficult political landscape. The uncertainty around what happens next gives some of Boris Johnson's colleagues cause for profound concern. Several ministers have told me privately they believe that ultimately the might of the Russian military machine will overwhelm Ukraine. What seems like a united Western front may go from looking powerful in rhetoric, the initial response to Russian aggression, but may in time come to look powerless if the outcome goes terribly, terribly wrong. Tories must sack co-chair over Russia links - Labour Give Russia-linked Tory donations to charity - MP Starmer hails Birmingham by-election win Some in government worry about the public reaction if international outrage - from the PM's push to exclude Russia from the banking system, to BP offloading billions of pounds of Russian assets, to pub owners taking Russian vodka off the shelves - ends in a prolonged conflict with terrible loss of life that we all witness night after night on our phones and TV screens. The primary fear is what a cornered Vladimir Putin might do. There is a sense that nothing makes sense, nothing can be predicted, because he follows no logic that standard politicians would apply. But there is also a fear about how to manage public opinion and expectation at home as things develop. And the government's handling of the situation is not free from criticism either. Ministers emphasise how the UK pushed harder and faster for action to isolate Russia, whether from international finance, or the banking system, or providing crucial military support. But among the opposition and some Tory MPs too there is frustration at the speed of sanctions being applied to individuals. And there's embarrassment over the Conservative party's links to wealthy people of Russian origins, doubts resurfacing about theelevation of Evgeny Lebedev to the House of Lords. There are questions too about whether the UK is extending enough of a welcome to Ukrainians fleeing from danger. The home secretary has even been accused of showing a lack of humanity by her French opposite number. We've gone in a very short time from a Westminster saga that outraged swathes of the public, drove the Conservatives round the twist and threatened Boris Johnson's job, to a government seized with the gravity of an international crisis with a leader determined to play a leading role. But the latter doesn't make the former disappear. Concerns about Boris Johnson's leadership in his own party are gone for now, but are not forgotten.

"Shell has defended its decision to purchase Russian crude oil despite the invasion and bombardment of Ukraine. The oil giant said in a statement that the decision to purchase the fuel at a discounted price was ""difficult"". It confirmed that it had bought a cargo of Russian crude oil on Friday but it had ""no alternative"". Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba hit out at the energy company, asking on Twitter: ""Doesn't Russian oil smell Ukrainian blood for you?"" So far Canada hasannounced a ban on Russian oil importsbut other Western countries have not imposed sanctions on Russian oil imports, fearing it will drive up already record high energy prices around the world. But on Sunday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the US was now in ""active discussions"" with European partners about banning them while also maintaining a ""steady global supply"". Russia is the world's second top producer of crude oil after Saudi Arabia, and supplies about a third of Europe's needs. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Commenting on its move, Shell said it was forced to buy oil from Russia in order to maintain timely supplies of fuel to Europe. The firm said it remains ""appalled by the war in Ukraine"" and has stopped most activities involving Russian oil, but it added the situation with supplies is ""highly complex"". Russian oil currently makes up about 8% of Shell's working supplies. One of the firm's refineries, which produces diesel and petrol and other products, is also among the biggest in Europe. ""To be clear, without an uninterrupted supply of crude oil to refineries, the energy industry cannot assure continued provision of essential products to people across Europe over the weeks ahead,"" a spokesperson said. ""Cargoes from alternative sources would not have arrived in time to avoid disruptions to market supply. ""We didn't take this decision lightly and we understand the strength of feeling around it."" Oil price rises again as buyers shun Russian fuel Ukraine war is economic catastrophe - World Bank Shell to sell Russian investments due to Ukraine BP to offload stake in Russian oil firm Rosneft The firm also said that it will try to choose alternatives to Russian oil ""wherever possible"", and that profits from Russian oil will go to a dedicated fund aimed at helping people in Ukraine. It comes shortly after the company announced that it would end all of its joint ventures with the Russian energy company Gazprom following the invasion. That will involve the company selling its 27.5% stake in a major liquefied natural gas plant and a 50% stake in two oilfield projects in Siberia. It will also end its involvement in the Nord Stream 2 pipeline between Russia and Germany. The 1,200km pipeline under the Baltic Sea had already beenput on hold by German ministers. In a statement issued on Monday, Shell said that it expected the move, which will also apply to any ""related entities"" to Gazprom, would be worth about $3bn (Â£2.2bn). The associated costs will be marked on its balance sheet later this year. Shell followed on from the likes of BP, which had already announced that it would offload its stake in the Russian state-owned oil giant Rosneft - a potential hit of $25bn. BP said earlier this week it was too soon to say how or to whom its stake in Rosneft would be sold. Norwegian oil and gas producer Equinor has also announced its exit from Russia, saying the conflict made its current position ""untenable"".

"A little girl clutches a doll at a checkpoint on the Ukraine-Slovakia border In Ukraine, families are having to adapt to a terrifying new reality. How do you tell young children that you're at war? Ten days ago Anton Eine, a science fiction writer in Ukraine, had been due to launch his latest book - but then the Russians invaded. Now, he says, none of that matters any more. He is hunkering down in Kyiv with his wife and their three-year-old son. They live in a 24-storey apartment block with an underground car park, where people are sleeping on the concrete floor. It's bitterly cold, and Anton is worried about what might happen if the building collapses, so he and his family feel safer in a square concrete well between the lifts. That has become their sanctuary during the constant air raid sirens. They bring toys and their son's tablet and make sure he sits in the corner, which is the safest place. Anton says their son is worried, and asks lots of questions. ""Yesterday, my wife went downstairs and when she returned, he was asking, 'Mum, did they shoot you?' and she said 'No baby', and he said, 'Will they shoot me? I don't want them to go bang-bang'."" How to deal with your anxiety about the Ukraine crisis Anton says some parents have sewn badges with their child's blood group on to their clothes and are teaching them their home address and parents' names, in case they are separated. And while they hide in shelters or try to board trains to safety, many parents are also talking to each other about how the war is affecting their children, and how best to protect them from trauma. ""Some parents tell the kids it's a game,"" says Anton. ""We are trying to tell our son the truth, but in a softer way, adapted to the mind of a three-year-old kid. ""We tell him that bad soldiers attacked us and the good soldiers, the ones with the Ukrainian flag, are the ones who protect us, and you don't need to worry here in this sanctuary."" His own son's drawings don't appear to show any signs of trauma, but some of Anton's friends have older children, and the pictures they draw clearly show they've been affected by the situation. A friend of Anton's shared her four-year-old son's drawing after spending the night in a bomb shelter - it shows people fleeing a big red devil The parents and staff from his son's nursery stay in touch via the social media app Telegram, where they share advice about how to talk to the children about what's going on. This even included a tutorial on how to explain to the kids why it was OK for adults to swear now, while it was not OK in normal life. ""Because people are swearing right now,"" says Anton. They have become more relaxed about other little things, too. ""Because of this situation, he has to watch much more cartoons than normal, and is eating much more sweets than normal. We need something to occupy him - he has to not pay too much attention to what's going on. ""The psychologists advise us to be gentler with kids in these times, and to love them much more than usual,"" says Anton. When it comes to safety, though, they have to be quite strict. Their three-year-old quickly learned that when there's a siren, the family have to run and hide. ""As soon as we hear sirens or get a notification we shout, 'To the shelter!' and whatever he's doing he leaves it and runs. He understands that the situation is extraordinary. It even surprises us how well children understand the necessity to behave properly."" Evacuees and a child, sitting on top of a suitcase, wait for a train to Romania from Lviv As the Russian shelling gets worse and the convoys close in, many Ukrainian parents have decided to flee their homes with their young children in tow. Hanna, a scientist, left Kyiv and travelled to Poland with her two sons, who are eight and six years old. For days, they had been at home listening to explosions, the windows trembling, and she somehow had to tell them what was going on. She found it hard to strike a balance between reality and how much a child's mind can take. ""This was a challenge for me as a mother because I have to choose between how to explain the truth, but at the same time not to scare them too much,"" she says. ""So I was just telling them that we are under attack, and at the moment we are safe, but when we feel we have to move, they have to listen."" Her parenting style had to change, too - there was no room for discussion. ""Normally I ask them to do something, but this is a time to get orders."" A child on a swing outside a residential building in Kyiv damaged by a missile After a few days of shelling, Hanna felt she no longer wanted her children to hear the bombs and decided to leave Ukraine. ""It was a very, super hard decision,"" she says. Her children had to make a hard decision too - they could only take one of their toys. Her eldest chose Toothless, a toy dragon from the How to Train your Dragon series, and her youngest chose a Transformer toy car that turns into a robot. It was a huge decision for them, says Hanna - perhaps as momentous as it was for her to leave her country. ""I think that we were in the same emotional decision-taking position."" It took them 52 hours to reach safety in Poland. Hanna's ex-husband came with them for the first part of the car journey but then had to turn back, to fight. Hanna says travelling in a war zone with two kids was exhausting and she can understand why many of her friends are choosing to stay nearer home. Now they are safe, but the boys ask lots of questions, about their grandparents and especially their father, who has stayed behind. ""Heart-breaking questions, because they ask me every day if he is alive, or if he still has his hands and legs. They are afraid that he can get super hurt."" LIVE:Latest updates from on the ground IN KYIV:Locals fear another Grozny or Aleppo ANALYSIS:Europe finally steps up EXPLAINED:Why Putin has invaded Ukraine? IN DEPTH:Full coverage of the conflict Hanna tells them to try and live in the present. ""All we have is just now. At the moment we are safe,"" she says. How much to tell their children is something all parents are having to weigh up. Oksana fled her home town of Lviv, in the west, and is now also in Poland. Her six-year-old daughter is autistic and hates loud noises, so she found the air raid sirens very scary. She could tell her mother was nervous too, so Oksana told her the truth about what was happening. ""I was explaining that it's a war and we need to be safe, and that a lot of people are dead now because of all this,"" says Oksana. ""I think it is important that when children are old enough to understand they are not misled, because they can sense the atmosphere is bad."" Iryna's son is just two, and she has decided not to tell him too much. After spending three nights in a bomb shelter they left Irpin, a small city near Kyiv, and went to western Ukraine. She told her son they were going to stay with friends, because he's too young to understand that they're in danger. ""I didn't tell him that it's a war. I'm not sure I have to when he's so young, because I think it makes this situation only worse."" As for Anton and his family, the Russian troops are closing in and they may have to evacuate soon. He's not sure where to. ""No-one knows which place is the safest - so it's gambling,"" he says. Hanna, Oksana and Iryna spoke toOutside Source on the BBC World Service.

"Video-sharing site TikTok and streaming giant Netflix have limited and cut their services respectively in Russia following its invasion of Ukraine. TikTok said it had suspended live streaming and new content from its platform as it assesses tough new laws to crack down on ""fake news"" about Russia's armed forces. Netflix said it was pulling out in protest at the invasion. Visa, Mastercard and PwC also joined the list of western firms cutting ties. TikTok, which has around 36 million users in Russia, said its move was about ensuring the safety of its staff and users. Since Friday, anyone who writes news deemed false about the military could face up to 15 years in jail. Among other things, the Kremlin objects to the conflict being called a war, instead calling it a ""special military operation"". The BBC and other news outlets have already stopped reporting in Russia, saying they can no longer be independent. In a series of Tweets, TikTok said: ""In light of Russia's new 'fake news' law, we have no choice but to suspend live-streaming and new content to our video service while we review the safety implications of this law. ""Our in-app messaging service will not be affected."" BBC suspends its journalists' work in Russia Facebook hits out at Russia blocking its platforms Apple halts sales and limits services in Russia It added: ""We will continue to evaluate the evolving circumstances in Russia to determine when we might fully resume our services with safety as our top priority."" Chinese-owned TikTok, which has one billion users worldwide, has been criticised for not speaking out against Russia invading Ukraine, unlike its peers Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, and Twitter. But in a longer statement on its website on Sunday, it described the war in Ukraine as ""devastating"", adding that it had ""brought pain to our community and our people"". TikTok says it ""doesn't break down user numbers by country"" but we know that Russia is one of the company's top territories. It's thought that around 36m people use the app and TikTok's new rules reduce them to spectators of other people's content. TikTok says it's making the move to protect its users from breaking Russia's new ""fake news"" laws. But it will no doubt help the company too. Moderating social networks during times of crisis is hard enough, but having to vet content under the new draconian laws in Russia puts all platforms in a tough position. I wouldn't be surprised if other apps took similar measures to protect themselves. Russia has many high-profile creators who make their living from TikTok so we can expect even more people to be motivated to protest against the ""fake news"" laws. The Kremlin may also lose out in the information war too with less pro-Russia content on people's timelines. Last week, Netflixtemporarily stopped all future projects and acquisitionsin Russia as it assessed the impact of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. But on Sunday, a spokesperson said: ""Given the circumstances on the ground, we have decided to suspend our service in Russia.""

A host of companies have suspended their operationsin Russia since it attacked its neighbour, including Apple, Jaguar Land Rover, H&M and Burberry.

"Video-sharing site TikTok and streaming giant Netflix have limited and cut their services respectively in Russia following its invasion of Ukraine. TikTok said it had suspended live streaming and new content from its platform as it assesses tough new laws to crack down on ""fake news"" about Russia's armed forces. Netflix said it was pulling out in protest at the invasion. Visa, Mastercard and PwC also joined the list of western firms cutting ties. TikTok, which has around 36 million users in Russia, said its move was about ensuring the safety of its staff and users. Since Friday, anyone who writes news deemed false about the military could face up to 15 years in jail. Among other things, the Kremlin objects to the conflict being called a war, instead calling it a ""special military operation"". The BBC and other news outlets have already stopped reporting in Russia, saying they can no longer be independent. In a series of Tweets, TikTok said: ""In light of Russia's new 'fake news' law, we have no choice but to suspend live-streaming and new content to our video service while we review the safety implications of this law. ""Our in-app messaging service will not be affected."" BBC suspends its journalists' work in Russia Facebook hits out at Russia blocking its platforms Apple halts sales and limits services in Russia It added: ""We will continue to evaluate the evolving circumstances in Russia to determine when we might fully resume our services with safety as our top priority.""

"Visa, Mastercard and American Express have announced they will suspend all operations in Russia in protest at its invasion of Ukraine. But Russia's major banks have already downplayed the impact the move will have on consumers. Shoppers will still be able to use the cards for purchases within Russia until they reach their expiry dates. But Visa, Mastercard or American Express cards issued abroad will no longer work at shops or ATMs in Russia. Clients will no longer be able to use their Russian cards abroad or for international payments online either. Visa and Mastercard alone control about 90% of credit and debit payments in the world, outside of China. Zara, Paypal and Samsung suspend business in Russia Five ways the Ukraine war could push up prices Why has Putin invaded Ukraine? Earlier, Russia's central bank insisted that all Visa and Mastercard bank cards issued by Russian banks would continue to operate normally on Russian territory. That is because domestic payments in Russia are made through a national system and don't depend on foreign systems. Russia's biggest state-backed bank, Sberbank, said its cards would still work ""to withdraw cash, make transfers using the card number, and for payment at offline as well as at online Russian stores"". Since 2015, the Russian government has required all domestic payment transactions in the country be processed there. This followed similar suspensions of operations by Visa and Mastercard in Crimea, following its annexation. Several Russian banks suggested that they would start issuing cards that use the Chinese UnionPay system, coupled with Russia's Mir payment network, to avoid any impact for consumers. Farida Rustamova, an independent journalist who left Russia because of the invasion, criticised Visa and Mastercard's decision, saying it would cut off people like her from much needed funds. She told the BBC she had raced to withdraw cash following the news as she hasn't set up a foreign bank account yet, and many others face the same problem. ""Now thousands of people, including not only journalists but opposition activists and even common people who are scared of Putin's regime and are running from war will be cut from their little money. ""And the sad thing is this is exactly what Putin wants to happen."" Both Visa and Mastercard had already announced that they would comply with sanctions introduced by Western countries since the start of the conflict. ""This war and the ongoing threat to peace and stability demand we respond in line with our values,""said Visa boss Al Kelly,external. In a statement, Mastercard also described the ongoing invasion of Ukraine as ""shocking and devastating"". The card company has operated in Russia for more than 25 years. It confirmed that it would continue to pay the wages of its 200 staff members there. Visa added: ""We regret the impact this will have on our valued colleagues, and on the clients, partners, merchants and cardholders we serve in Russia."" It would not disclose how many Visa cards are in operation in Russia. American Express called Russia's attack on Ukraine ""unjustified"" and said it was also terminating all business operations in Belarus.

Susannah Streeter, senior markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, pointed out that the move cameafter the disconnection of Russian banks from the Swiftinternational payments system and a dramatic plunge in the rouble. ""Bank customers in Russia may be able to keep using the cards until they expire, but the boycott means Russians abroad will see their payments rejected, with the shutting out of some big spenders also likely to hurt a raft of businesses reliant on their custom,"" she said. She added that China's UnionPay is likely to be the alternative ""system of choice"" for Russian banks as it's already accepted around the world, although not as widely as Visa and Mastercard. ""But it will take significant time to re-issue millions of cards, and will add to the financial turmoil in the country."" The payments giants' announcement comes amid a widening corporate backlash to Russia's actions in Ukraine. Inditex-owner Zara and French fashion houses LVMH, Kering and Chanel have all said in recent days that they would stop sales temporarily in Russia. PayPal also said on Saturday that it had shut down services in Russia but that it would support withdrawals ""for a period of time"".

"We are now well into the second week of this war, and I've noticed that I don't cry any more. I start the day reading the overnight news, counting new blasts all around Ukraine. A couple of days ago, I woke up to reports of major rocket strikes in Kyiv, near where my dad lives. It took me 10 minutes to pluck up the courage to call him, to ask if he and his partner were all right. They were, and I experienced a wave of relief. When I see horrible pictures of destruction in Kyiv, and Russian tanks in towns and villages just outside, I think of these once-quiet places, where our friends have their dachas, or country cottages. We used to visit them with our kids, we had barbecues, and sipped wine in cosy armchairs. Some of those towns have now been destroyed by heavy fighting and artillery. At the start of the war, one thing that did bring tears to my eyes was a message on an app for events in Kyiv. It was a list of things that would not happen that day - concerts and exhibitions, events that now seem like something from a previous life. These apps now provide different kinds of information - notifications about air raids, lists of supermarkets with food and pharmacies with medicine. Marta Shokalo on fleeing Kyiv Marta Shokalo on the day Russia invaded My mother is more worried about how to get food for her dog and cats than for herself, but she called me the other day just to happily announce that she had managed to buy two loaves of bread! This is in a city where food used to be available in great abundance. That is more shocking for me than pictures of burned-out Russian tanks. Food shortages and empty shelves are our reality now. People share information on where you can buy and what. Some shops have shortages, but at the same time there is always enough for those who are in need. Restaurants prepare free food for soldiers, people who lost their homes or anyone who needs it. People in Kyiv wait in line to go food shopping My 10-year-old son is not going to school, even online. Some teachers have stayed in Kyiv, others have left. His classmates have fled to the countryside or abroad. They chat on Zoom, playing games and pretending to be hackers who fight for Ukraine. One of the chats they have set up on a messaging app is called ""war matters"". Every day, Ukrainians face the decision of whether to stay or to leave. During the first week of war, almost a million packed their bags and left Ukraine to become refugees. That number is rising fast. But many others have decided to stay, at least for now. Famous singers, artists and sportsmen have enrolled in the army. Millions of Ukrainians have become volunteers, trying to help those in greatest need. It feels like Ukrainians have become one big family where every member is trying to help, in any way they can. Those who can fight, fight. Those who can cook, cook. Those who can deliver, deliver. I heard a heart-breaking story from Kherson, the first city seized by Russian forces, where an elderly man without legs and fingers became a volunteer. Now every town and village has checkpoints, made of sandbags, cement blocks and cut trees. Armed men - young professionals who fled Kyiv, local farmers or pensioners - check the documents of anyone entering. The village where I am staying has two checkpoints, manned by local men who take turns to operate them 24 hours a day. They have hunting rifles, and some carry knives or axes. They are ready to protect their small communities with everything they have. This sense of unity has never been so strong among Ukrainians. The country is full of activity like a beehive, producing hope for victory. THE BASICS:Why is Putin invading Ukraine?

"President Volodymyr Zelensky has told Ukrainians they have ""withstood the blow"" of Russia's invasion as he urged citizens to continue fighting. In an impassioned speech delivered from Kyiv on Saturday night, Mr Zelensky told the country that the time has come for them to launch a fightback. ""You need to go out and drive this evil out of our cities,"" he said. The rallying cry came alongside a plea to US President Joe Biden to source more combat jets for Ukraine. US officials are believed to be in discussions with political leaders in Poland over the possibility of Warsaw providing Ukraine with a number of MiG fighter jets. Poland has been slowly phasing the Soviet-era fighter out of use - and officials are understood to be weighing whether to provide them to Ukraine, where pilots are not trained to fly Western-made jets. Some reports suggest they could be exchanged for new US-sponsored replacements. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has entered its 11th day, with some experts suggesting the invasion may have stalled in places - despite President Vladimir Putin's insistence on Saturday that the operation is ""going to plan."" While fighting has continued in many parts of the country, Moscow's forces have only captured one major Ukrainian city, Kherson - though it has made other key advances, such as seizing the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant on Friday. Much of Russia's military has so far underperformed in Ukraine. Prior to the invasion, it was assumed the army had undergone a radical re-haul, reorganising itself into so-called ""Battalion Tactical Groups"". These units of 800 to 1,000 men would operate in close coordination with tanks, drones and multiple-launch rocket systems to deliver a multi-faceted punch to the enemy. But it hasn't worked out like that. Russian commanders, especially in the north, have manifestly failed to make full use of this modern kind of warfare. Their vehicles have also suffered mechanical breakdowns and they appear to have underestimated the strength of Ukrainian resistance, losing large numbers of men and equipment. So now, as grimly predicted, the gloves have come off. Russian military tactics have reverted to a crude but tried and tested doctrine: encircle a city, pummel it with airstrikes, tank and artillery fire, and break the morale of both its defenders and those simply trying to survive. International condemnation of the mounting civilian casualties will not bother President Putin. He's made it abundantly clear he has no intention of calling off this invasion. Outside the capital of Kyiv, a massive convoy stretching over 40 miles (64km) remains stalled outside the city and Ukrainian defence officials say they have been hitting selected targets within the convoy where they can. Elsewhere: There has been intense fighting to the north-west of Kyiv, where Russian troops have been attempting to re-take the strategicHostomel airfield Moscow's forces have also been bombardingIrpin,a town on the outskirts of Kyiv Ukrainian officials say a ceasefire agreed to allow civilians to escape from the city ofMariupollasted for less than 30 minutes before shelling resumed KharkivandSumyin the east have also come under renewed bombardment Russia said it has advanced by 7km (four miles) in theDonbas region, taking several towns and villages InKherson, the only major city to have changed hands, there are reports of Russian troops firing on protesters to break up an anti-Russian demonstration The head of the UN's refugee agency told Reuters that the number of refugees fleeing the Russian invasion could rise to 1.5 million by the end of the weekend. ""This is the fastest moving refugee crisis we have seen in Europe since the end of World War Two,"" UNHCR head Filippo Grandi said. Russian forces have been heavily shelling towns outside the capital of Kyiv As fighting rumbles on in Ukraine, Western sanctions continue to hammer the Russian economy. On Saturday night, the payments giants Visa and Mastercard both announced that they will withdraw their services from Russia, with Visa's chief executive Al Kelly saying in a statement that the company had been ""compelled to act following Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, and the unacceptable events that we have witnessed"". The move means Russian banks will no longer be supported by the companies' networks, and any cards issued outside of the country will stop working at Russian merchants or ATMs. But Sberbank, the country's largest lender, emphasised that Russians will be able to withdraw cash, make transfers, and pay both in offline stores and Russian internet stores, because transactions in the country pass through the domestic National Payment Card System, which does not depend on foreign payment systems.

"A little girl clutches a doll at a checkpoint on the Ukraine-Slovakia border In Ukraine, families are having to adapt to a terrifying new reality. How do you tell young children that you're at war? Ten days ago Anton Eine, a science fiction writer in Ukraine, had been due to launch his latest book - but then the Russians invaded. Now, he says, none of that matters any more. He is hunkering down in Kyiv with his wife and their three-year-old son. They live in a 24-storey apartment block with an underground car park, where people are sleeping on the concrete floor. It's bitterly cold, and Anton is worried about what might happen if the building collapses, so he and his family feel safer in a square concrete well between the lifts. That has become their sanctuary during the constant air raid sirens. They bring toys and their son's tablet and make sure he sits in the corner, which is the safest place. Anton says their son is worried, and asks lots of questions. ""Yesterday, my wife went downstairs and when she returned, he was asking, 'Mum, did they shoot you?' and she said 'No baby', and he said, 'Will they shoot me? I don't want them to go bang-bang'."" How to deal with your anxiety about the Ukraine crisis Anton says some parents have sewn badges with their child's blood group on to their clothes and are teaching them their home address and parents' names, in case they are separated. And while they hide in shelters or try to board trains to safety, many parents are also talking to each other about how the war is affecting their children, and how best to protect them from trauma. ""Some parents tell the kids it's a game,"" says Anton. ""We are trying to tell our son the truth, but in a softer way, adapted to the mind of a three-year-old kid. ""We tell him that bad soldiers attacked us and the good soldiers, the ones with the Ukrainian flag, are the ones who protect us, and you don't need to worry here in this sanctuary."" His own son's drawings don't appear to show any signs of trauma, but some of Anton's friends have older children, and the pictures they draw clearly show they've been affected by the situation. A friend of Anton's shared her four-year-old son's drawing after spending the night in a bomb shelter - it shows people fleeing a big red devil The parents and staff from his son's nursery stay in touch via the social media app Telegram, where they share advice about how to talk to the children about what's going on. This even included a tutorial on how to explain to the kids why it was OK for adults to swear now, while it was not OK in normal life. ""Because people are swearing right now,"" says Anton. They have become more relaxed about other little things, too. ""Because of this situation, he has to watch much more cartoons than normal, and is eating much more sweets than normal. We need something to occupy him - he has to not pay too much attention to what's going on. ""The psychologists advise us to be gentler with kids in these times, and to love them much more than usual,"" says Anton. When it comes to safety, though, they have to be quite strict. Their three-year-old quickly learned that when there's a siren, the family have to run and hide. ""As soon as we hear sirens or get a notification we shout, 'To the shelter!' and whatever he's doing he leaves it and runs. He understands that the situation is extraordinary. It even surprises us how well children understand the necessity to behave properly."" Evacuees and a child, sitting on top of a suitcase, wait for a train to Romania from Lviv As the Russian shelling gets worse and the convoys close in, many Ukrainian parents have decided to flee their homes with their young children in tow. Hanna, a scientist, left Kyiv and travelled to Poland with her two sons, who are eight and six years old. For days, they had been at home listening to explosions, the windows trembling, and she somehow had to tell them what was going on. She found it hard to strike a balance between reality and how much a child's mind can take. ""This was a challenge for me as a mother because I have to choose between how to explain the truth, but at the same time not to scare them too much,"" she says. ""So I was just telling them that we are under attack, and at the moment we are safe, but when we feel we have to move, they have to listen."" Her parenting style had to change, too - there was no room for discussion. ""Normally I ask them to do something, but this is a time to get orders."" A child on a swing outside a residential building in Kyiv damaged by a missile After a few days of shelling, Hanna felt she no longer wanted her children to hear the bombs and decided to leave Ukraine. ""It was a very, super hard decision,"" she says. Her children had to make a hard decision too - they could only take one of their toys. Her eldest chose Toothless, a toy dragon from the How to Train your Dragon series, and her youngest chose a Transformer toy car that turns into a robot. It was a huge decision for them, says Hanna - perhaps as momentous as it was for her to leave her country. ""I think that we were in the same emotional decision-taking position."" It took them 52 hours to reach safety in Poland. Hanna's ex-husband came with them for the first part of the car journey but then had to turn back, to fight. Hanna says travelling in a war zone with two kids was exhausting and she can understand why many of her friends are choosing to stay nearer home. Now they are safe, but the boys ask lots of questions, about their grandparents and especially their father, who has stayed behind. ""Heart-breaking questions, because they ask me every day if he is alive, or if he still has his hands and legs. They are afraid that he can get super hurt."" LIVE:Latest updates from on the ground IN KYIV:Locals fear another Grozny or Aleppo ANALYSIS:Europe finally steps up EXPLAINED:Why Putin has invaded Ukraine? IN DEPTH:Full coverage of the conflict Hanna tells them to try and live in the present. ""All we have is just now. At the moment we are safe,"" she says. How much to tell their children is something all parents are having to weigh up. Oksana fled her home town of Lviv, in the west, and is now also in Poland. Her six-year-old daughter is autistic and hates loud noises, so she found the air raid sirens very scary. She could tell her mother was nervous too, so Oksana told her the truth about what was happening. ""I was explaining that it's a war and we need to be safe, and that a lot of people are dead now because of all this,"" says Oksana. ""I think it is important that when children are old enough to understand they are not misled, because they can sense the atmosphere is bad."" Iryna's son is just two, and she has decided not to tell him too much. After spending three nights in a bomb shelter they left Irpin, a small city near Kyiv, and went to western Ukraine. She told her son they were going to stay with friends, because he's too young to understand that they're in danger. ""I didn't tell him that it's a war. I'm not sure I have to when he's so young, because I think it makes this situation only worse."" As for Anton and his family, the Russian troops are closing in and they may have to evacuate soon. He's not sure where to. ""No-one knows which place is the safest - so it's gambling,"" he says. Hanna, Oksana and Iryna spoke toOutside Source on the BBC World Service.

"President Volodymyr Zelensky has told Ukrainians they have ""withstood the blow"" of Russia's invasion as he urged citizens to continue fighting. In an impassioned speech delivered from Kyiv on Saturday night, Mr Zelensky told the country that the time has come for them to launch a fightback. ""You need to go out and drive this evil out of our cities,"" he said. The rallying cry came alongside a plea to US President Joe Biden to source more combat jets for Ukraine. US officials are believed to be in discussions with political leaders in Poland over the possibility of Warsaw providing Ukraine with a number of MiG fighter jets. Poland has been slowly phasing the Soviet-era fighter out of use - and officials are understood to be weighing whether to provide them to Ukraine, where pilots are not trained to fly Western-made jets. Some reports suggest they could be exchanged for new US-sponsored replacements. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has entered its 11th day, with some experts suggesting the invasion may have stalled in places - despite President Vladimir Putin's insistence on Saturday that the operation is ""going to plan."" While fighting has continued in many parts of the country, Moscow's forces have only captured one major Ukrainian city, Kherson - though it has made other key advances, such as seizing the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant on Friday. Much of Russia's military has so far underperformed in Ukraine. Prior to the invasion, it was assumed the army had undergone a radical re-haul, reorganising itself into so-called ""Battalion Tactical Groups"". These units of 800 to 1,000 men would operate in close coordination with tanks, drones and multiple-launch rocket systems to deliver a multi-faceted punch to the enemy. But it hasn't worked out like that. Russian commanders, especially in the north, have manifestly failed to make full use of this modern kind of warfare.

"A building on fire after a strike near the centre of Mariupol A ceasefire, and a chance for civilians to leave, was announced on Saturday morning in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol, where an estimated 200,000 people are trapped under heavy bombardment by Russian forces. The city arranged 50 buses, and many people travelled to the city centre to get them. But after less than two hours, Russia's army began shelling residential areas again, trapping civilians who had begun their escape. The city is now in its fifth day with no running water, no power, no sanitation, and food and water are fast running out. Maxim, a 27-year-old IT developer who is caring for his grandparents in their sixth-floor apartment, spoke to the BBC on Saturday night to describe a day that began with hope and ended in despair. We tried to escape today, during the planned time of no shooting. We heard we could get out. As fast as I could, I packed four bags for me and my grandparents with warm clothes and food, and all of our remaining water, and I packed them into my car. My grandparents are in their eighties, they cannot help. I carried everything down six flights of stairs to my car. There is no lift now. Right when I was ready to drive, the shelling started again. I heard explosions near to us. I carried everything back upstairs as fast as I could to the apartment. From there, I could see smoke rising from the city and smoke rising from the highway to Zaporizhzhia where people were supposed to escape. So I am still in my grandparents' apartment and the shelling and bombing has continued all day. But now instead of three of us here, there are nearly 20. Many people came into the city centre because they heard there was a ceasefire and buses to take them out, and to flee the shelling there. Then they could not get back to their shelters when it started again. So we have taken many people into the apartment. They are from the left side of the city, they say it is destroyed. All the houses are burning and no-one can put out the fires. There are many dead bodies lying in the streets and no-one can carry them. I know three of the people from before, from my neighbourhood, but the rest I do not know. The oldest is a woman in her late 70s, the youngest is a small child. We also have two cats, a parrot and a dog. We have tried to make space for the women and children to sleep on the floor. We don't have any extra mattresses but we have put some spare carpet and clothes on the floor for them to lie on. We have run out of bottled water. We are down to the water that I filled in the bath before the taps went off. The gas is the only thing still working - we can use it to boil the bath water to drink. Cramped conditions in Maxim's flat in Mariupol Today the police opened the stores and told people to take everything, because the people here have no food and drink. Our neighbours managed to take some candy, some fish and some fizzy drinks. The ceasefire was a lie. One side never planned to stop firing. If they say there is a ceasefire tomorrow [Sunday] we will have to try to go, but we don't know if it will be real. Maybe now we are better to hide. You can keep calling me as long as I have some battery left in my phone, but I don't know how long that will be. After today I am without hope. From now on we do what we have to each day only to survive and for our neighbours to survive. After that I don't know what comes next. We are very tired and we do not see a way out.

"This video can not be played Naomi Long was speaking at the Alliance Party's conference in Belfast on Saturday The assembly election in May will be a chance to say no to ""political soap operas"" and deliver politics that works, Naomi Long has said. The Alliance Party leader said it was not a time to walk away from government, but ""lead in government"". Mrs Long is leading the party into the second assembly election since she took over in 2016. She addressed the party's annual conference on Saturday - its first since the Covid pandemic began. The party currently has seven assembly members (MLAs) at Stormont, but is hoping that will rise following successful local government, European and Westminster elections in 2019. Mrs Long has also been Stormont's justice minister since January 2020, remaining in post despite the absence of an executive after the DUP withdrew Paul Givan as first minister. She said it was ""hard to fathom"" that Stormont was again without an executive after being restored just two years ago. ""It seems some politicians are addicted to crisis and conflict and simply not up to the job of actually governing,"" Mrs Long said. ""People have had enough of the constant dramas and political soap operas. ""They want politicians who don't just identify more problems - or worse still, add to them - but who are focused on finding solutions."" As it happened: Naomi Long's speech Givan resignation triggers fresh political crisis MPs pass bill to prevent future Stormont collapse She added that Alliance had so far been ""punching well above its weight"" in the assembly but needed to ""finish the job"". She citeda private members bill her party had brought seeking to ban hunting of animals with dogs, and said ""four more Alliance"" MLAs could have helped pass the bill after other parties voted against it. ""May's election won't just determine how our politics works for the next five years - it will determine if it works."" Party members gathered at a Belfast hotel Alliance is part of the bloc that designates as other in the assembly, but Mrs Long has previously said that system means her party's views are not considered on controversial issues that require cross-community support, i.e. a majority of both unionists and nationalists. Deputy leader Stephen Farry also addressed conference. He was elected as the party's sole MP for North Down in the 2019 general election. He described Alliance as ""protocol realists"". TheNorthern Ireland Protocol puts a trade border in the Irish Sea. North Down MP Stephen Farry took to the stage before his party leader Mr Farry said: ""In the absence of an alternative, the only course of action is to try and make it work. ""We are protocol realists. ""We are committed to doing all we can to reduce the level and impact of the resultant checks down the Irish Sea through seeking closer alignment between the UK and the EU, and achieving further mitigations, flexibilities and derogations from EU requirements."" The conference took place in Belfast on Saturday. The assembly election is due to take place on 5 May.

"Oil prices have soared to 10-year highs Northern Ireland's oil prices have shot up more than 35% in the week after Russia invaded Ukraine - so what does it mean for the UK's most oil-dependent nation? More than two-thirds of homes in Northern Ireland rely on oil for heating -the highest percentage in Western Europe,external- compared to just 4% in England and Wales. In the seven days afterthe invasion, the average price for 900 litres of home heating oil went up more than Â£200, from Â£555.72 on 24 February, to Â£758.11 on 3 March,figures from the Northern Ireland Consumer Council,externalshow. Meanwhile the number of households in fuel poverty in Northern Ireland is predicted to have doubled, from 22% to more than 40%, according to National Energy Action (NEA). It has also prompted a run on home heating oil, with some companies limiting their sales, or selling beyond their stock levels, so they will likely be selling at a loss if prices continue to rise. Pat Austin, NEA's Northern Ireland director, said the charity was seeing more people who had completely run out of fuel. Two weeks ago they topped up oil for a man in Belfast whose tank had been empty since last August, she said. The man, aged in his thirties, had been rationing his electricity by using his kettle to bathe - turning on the immersion heater for a shower just once a fortnight. The number of households in fuel poverty in Northern Ireland is predicted to have doubled As of Friday, a spot check of oil prices in Northern Ireland by the Consumer Council puts the average for 900 litres at Â£758.11. That's a 44% rise since 3 February, when the average price was Â£527.97. ""These figures have to be putting fuel poverty in the region of 40% easy; it is a perfect storm,"" Ms Austin said. ""We're looking at emergency interventions. We're dealing with people who are out of electricity overnight, we are now having to send people on to food banks."" Tensions between Russia and the West were already driving power prices up and that's accelerated since Russia invaded Ukraine last week, pushing them to 10-year highs. Russia is one of the world's largest energy producers. But it's now subject toa number of sanctions from Western nations, and that's reportedlycausing problems for buyers of Russian oil,external. Energy bills could reach Â£3,000 as oil price soars Oil hits $113 a barrel despite emergency measures Major oil and gas companies, including BP and Shell, have also announcedplans to exit Russian operations. And price rises are expected to continue in the near-term. Why are energy bills going up? Oil prices have been climbing, like gas and electricity, but because oil is unregulated in Northern Ireland, cost increases are passed on directly to the buyer, Peter McClenaghan, director of infrastructure and sustainability at the Consumer Council, said. ""Russia supplies about 12% of global oil supplies so that's really worrying for Northern Ireland consumers because Northern Ireland consumers pay straight away what the world market is saying. ""Whereas with gas there's a time period before they can pass on increases, in oil that doesn't happen so those spikes in prices have been seen in Northern Ireland straight away, so it's a really significant, negative change for Northern Ireland consumers and one that's happened just virtually overnight."" Russian gas flows through pipelines across eastern and central Europe In 2016, when fuel poverty was last measured in Northern Ireland,it was at 22%,external, but estimates from the Housing Executive forin 2017 and 2018 put it as low as 17%,externaland 18%. But in 2009, fuel poverty levels were double that at 44% - and that's where NEA expects it to be in Northern Ireland now. Donna Lennon gets her oil via a social enterprise buying group, which reduces costs for its members by buying in bulk, and allows smaller purchases so customers avoid the higher costs of ordering low volumes directly from the supplier. Without it, the single mother of two, who lives in Newcastle, County Down, said she would be in fuel poverty. Northern Ireland also hasseveral oil buying clubs,external, which work on a similar principle. Donna Lennon says she relies on the saving she gets buying in bulk via Fuel Round She said the discount she gets is the difference between running oil and heating the whole house, and using only her fireplace. ""Especially when you have a young family and your oil is on a lot, I would have to choose between that and wood, and just light a fire and sit in the sitting room. ""It could be the difference between heating the bedrooms and sitting in the living room for the fire."" James McGovern, from the buying group Fuel Round in County Down, said households were reducing the size of their orders as costs increased. ""Overall demand has noticeably risen since the Ukraine crisis, but the per-order volume is markedly down, as households grapple with increased costs."" This week some Northern Ireland oil companies cut the volume of each sale. Others sold beyond their stock levels, meaning they could lose money on orders when prices rise beyond what quoted for. Damian Fusco, from Bangor Fuels, said: ""The general public is under the impression that we have large stocks of oil - stock generally lasts days not weeks. ""Most heating oil retailers would have a volume of stock on their premises which they replenish daily - that volume is sold. ""I'm taking orders for more than week away which I haven't got the stock for, so it may by the time I get to that call I may have ended up having to pay more than that for the oil."" Northern Ireland imports all its oil via a handful of multinational suppliers. That means local firms have no power to increase their orders to match demand. On Tuesday, none of Omagh firm MAC Fuels' three suppliers would deliver oil, its company director Yvonne Wilson said. They limited their sales to 400 litres this week. ""One customer has told me that she is working just to eat and heat, while another said its a case of keeping the house warm while his children get ready for school and bed. When the children aren't at home he just wears a coat rather than waste any oil -this is the reality of how families and the elderly are struggling at the minute.""

"We are now well into the second week of this war, and I've noticed that I don't cry any more. I start the day reading the overnight news, counting new blasts all around Ukraine. A couple of days ago, I woke up to reports of major rocket strikes in Kyiv, near where my dad lives. It took me 10 minutes to pluck up the courage to call him, to ask if he and his partner were all right. They were, and I experienced a wave of relief. When I see horrible pictures of destruction in Kyiv, and Russian tanks in towns and villages just outside, I think of these once-quiet places, where our friends have their dachas, or country cottages. We used to visit them with our kids, we had barbecues, and sipped wine in cosy armchairs. Some of those towns have now been destroyed by heavy fighting and artillery. At the start of the war, one thing that did bring tears to my eyes was a message on an app for events in Kyiv. It was a list of things that would not happen that day - concerts and exhibitions, events that now seem like something from a previous life. These apps now provide different kinds of information - notifications about air raids, lists of supermarkets with food and pharmacies with medicine. Marta Shokalo on fleeing Kyiv Marta Shokalo on the day Russia invaded My mother is more worried about how to get food for her dog and cats than for herself, but she called me the other day just to happily announce that she had managed to buy two loaves of bread! This is in a city where food used to be available in great abundance. That is more shocking for me than pictures of burned-out Russian tanks. Food shortages and empty shelves are our reality now. People share information on where you can buy and what. Some shops have shortages, but at the same time there is always enough for those who are in need. Restaurants prepare free food for soldiers, people who lost their homes or anyone who needs it. People in Kyiv wait in line to go food shopping My 10-year-old son is not going to school, even online. Some teachers have stayed in Kyiv, others have left. His classmates have fled to the countryside or abroad. They chat on Zoom, playing games and pretending to be hackers who fight for Ukraine. One of the chats they have set up on a messaging app is called ""war matters"". Every day, Ukrainians face the decision of whether to stay or to leave. During the first week of war, almost a million packed their bags and left Ukraine to become refugees. That number is rising fast. But many others have decided to stay, at least for now. Famous singers, artists and sportsmen have enrolled in the army. Millions of Ukrainians have become volunteers, trying to help those in greatest need. It feels like Ukrainians have become one big family where every member is trying to help, in any way they can. Those who can fight, fight. Those who can cook, cook. Those who can deliver, deliver. I heard a heart-breaking story from Kherson, the first city seized by Russian forces, where an elderly man without legs and fingers became a volunteer. Now every town and village has checkpoints, made of sandbags, cement blocks and cut trees. Armed men - young professionals who fled Kyiv, local farmers or pensioners - check the documents of anyone entering. The village where I am staying has two checkpoints, manned by local men who take turns to operate them 24 hours a day. They have hunting rifles, and some carry knives or axes. They are ready to protect their small communities with everything they have. This sense of unity has never been so strong among Ukrainians. The country is full of activity like a beehive, producing hope for victory. THE BASICS:Why is Putin invading Ukraine?

"Emergency services in the aftermath of a strike on a TV tower in Kyiv on Tuesday that killed five The key Ukrainian port city of Mariupol was ""near to a humanitarian catastrophe"" on Wednesday after more than 15 hours of continuous bombardment by Russian forces, the city's deputy mayor told the BBC. ""The Russian army is working through all their weapons here - artillery, multiple rocket launch systems, airplanes, tactical rockets. They are trying to destroy the city,"" Serhiy Orlov said. Mr Orlov said Russian forces were several kilometres from the city on all sides and had launched strikes on key infrastructure, cutting water and power supplies to parts of the city. One densely populated residential district on the city's left bank had been ""nearly totally destroyed"", he said. ""We cannot count the number of victims there, but we believe at least hundreds of people are dead. We cannot go in to retrieve the bodies. My father lives there, I cannot reach him, I don't know if he is alive or dead."" Russian forces had targeted strikes against pump stations and electrical transformers, Mr Orlov said, and there were food shortages in parts of the city - raising fears of an approaching humanitarian crisis. Mariupol is a key strategic target for Russia because seizing it would allow Russian-backed separatist forces in eastern Ukraine to join forces with troops in Crimea, the southern peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014. Ukraine's army has resisted Russian forces so far in key parts of the country but the increased aerial bombardment of cities has raised fears Russia is shifting tactics. ""The Ukrainian army is very brave and they will continue to defend the city but the style of the Russian army is like pirates - they do not fight with their army, they just destroy entire districts,"" Mr Orlov said. ""We believe in our Ukrainian army, but we are in a terrible situation."" Russia's invasion of Ukraine took a heavy toll on civilians on Wednesday as residential neighbourhoods in several large cities were bombed. Ukraine's emergency services said more than 2,000 civilians had been killed so far during the Russian invasion, though the BBC was not able to independently verify the figure. The UN said on Tuesday that at least 136 civilians had been killed, but it estimated that the actual number was higher. There were fears on Wednesday that the death toll would rise dramatically as Russian troops appeared to surround the country's second-largest city, Kharkiv, and the port city of Kherson. Ukrainian forces said Russian paratroopers had landed near Kharkiv on Wednesday, leading to street fighting on the outskirts of the city. Local officials said a cruise missile hit a city council meeting, blowing off the top of the building and wounding three. At least 18 people have been reported killed in the city in the past day. A fire at the a Kharkiv university building after it was hit by a Russian missile on Wednesday Residents in Kharkiv told the BBC they were experiencing heavy aerial bombardment. ""It is exhausting and terrifying living under this pressure,"" said Iryna Ruzhynska, 40, who was sheltering with her family in her second-floor apartment on Wednesday. ""We have put Scotch tape on the windows and pillows by the window stills,"" Ms Ruzhynska said. ""We don't turn on the lights, only the torches on our phones. We managed to go to the store yesterday, but we queued for four hours and there was virtually no food left."" The Russian defence ministry claimed its forces were in control of Kherson, a city of nearly 250,000 people just north of Crimea, but local authorities said the city was still under Ukrainian control, despite being surrounded. Video footage verified by the BBC appeared to show Russian troops in the centre of Kherson. LIVE:Latest updates from on the ground THE BASICS:Why is Putin invading Ukraine? RUSSIA SANCTIONS:'If I could leave, I would' UKRAINE:Desperate scenes in Lviv train station IN DEPTH:Full coverage of the conflict Larysa Pavlovska, a 58-year-old paramedic in Kherson, told the BBC her part of the city was quiet on Wednesday but other parts were smouldering after intense overnight shelling, adding that some residential districts had been ""bombed out"". ""Local residents say Russian armoured vehicles can be seen moving in the city, people say about 50 units,"" she said. ""They have been spotted by the state regional administration building."" Inesa Chamlai, the deputy head of the emergency aid centre in Kherson, said Russian troops had prevented them taking a wounded 55-year-old man to hospital. The man had stepped on a mine and lost his leg, Mr Chamlai said. ""Our ambulance team was dispatched but was then prevented by Russian troops from taking the man to hospital,"" he said. ""The soldiers ordered to bring him back to his house where he will definitely die."" There were also growing fears in the capital, Kyiv, over a 40-mile long convoy of Russian military vehicles just 15 miles north of the city, though US officials said on Wednesday the column was barely moving. In Irpin, close to Kyiv, residential buildings have been destroyed Russia's air force struck a television mast in the capital on Tuesday, killing five people at the site of a Nazi massacre which killed more than 33,000, mostly Jews, while a missile strike west of Kyiv, in the city of Zhytomyr, killed four people including a child, a Ukrainian official said. In a video message on Wednesday, Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky, who is Jewish, condemned the strike at the site of the massacre, accusing the Russians of trying to ""erase"" Ukrainians. ""They know nothing about our capital. About our history. But they have an order to erase our history. Erase our country. Erase us all,"" he said. A UK government spokesperson said Prime Minister Boris Johnson spoke to Mr Zelensky on Wednesday ""to condemn the abhorrent attacks on Ukraine in the recent hours and days"". In an address on Tuesday, the US president Joe Biden called Russian President Vladimir Putin a ""dictator"" and promised ""robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions is targeted at Russia's economy"". Nearly a week after invading, Russia is facing increasing economic turmoil at home as it is hit by increasing sanctions. The Moscow Stock Exchange remained closed for the third day in a row on Wednesday as authorities tried to limit the impact of the sanctions. ""The Russian economy has suffered a serious blow,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, insisting that it was ""still standing"". Have you been affected by any of the issues raised here?

Western leaders say they don't want to make the situation worse Edited by Jessica Murphy For technical reasons, we will be switching out live coverage to a new webpage. You can continue to follow our around the clock coverage of the war in Ukraineat this link here. US President Joe Biden has said his administration is
working closely with Congress to secure additional funding for Ukraine. Biden made the statement during a phone call with his Ukrainian
counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky on Saturday. The US president reiterated his support for
Ukraine and praised the skill and bravery of its citizens and troops. A White House readout from the call made no mention of Zelensky's repeated requests for assistance in setting up a no-fly zone over Ukraine. The US and other Nato nations have rejected such
requests over concerns it could escalate the conflict. Instead they have focused on imposing severe economic sanctions on Russia and some
of its wealthiest people. They have also been providing military, medical and humanitarian aid to Ukraine. From Rome to Munich to London, people gathered today to oppose Russia's invasion of Ukraine. It's the second weekend in a row that people have protested in cities around the world to show their support for Ukraine. Watch to see where the demonstrations took place.  This video can not be played Canada's foreign ministry is urging Canadians to avoid all travel to Russia, and has told Canadian citizens there that they ""should leave while commercial means are still available"". It told citizens that if they stayed, they could face ""shortages of essential products and services"" and ""may not be able to use your banking cards for payment or to withdraw funds"". It also warned that those who remain in Russia should  ""not depend on the Government of Canada to help you leave the country"". Earlier today, the US State Department issued a similar advisory, telling citizens there to depart immediately. The UK Foreign Office has also told  Britons whose presence in Russia is ""not essential"" that they are strongly advised to consider leaving by currently available commercial routes. The mayor
of Mariupol says Russian forces have intensified shelling in the Ukrainian city. Vadym
Boychenko said the port city was in âa very, very difficult state of siegeâ. âRelentless
shelling of residential blocks is ongoing, airplanes have been dropping bombs
on residential areas,â the AP news agency quoted him as saying. He added
that residents, including women and children, came under fire as they tried to
leave the city. The port
city has been witnessing intense shelling for days as Russian troops have been
trying to cut Ukraine off from this strategically important sea link. Russian forces have continued to shell Mariupol despite agreeing to a ceasefire, throwing an attempted mass evacuation of civilians into chaos. You can read more about that here Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke with US President Joe Biden today. ""As part of the constant dialogue, I had another conversation with @POTUS,"" Zelensky wrote on Twitter. ""The agenda included the issues of security, financial support for Ukraine and the continuation of sanctions against Russia."" Zelensky also spoke with Israel's Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, shortly after Bennett's three-hour meeting with Vladimir Putin in Moscow. Although Israel is a key ally of the US, Bennett has tried to preserve a good relationship with Russia. Israel, at the request of Zelensky, has offered to mediate in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. In the Black Sea port of Kherson - the only large city to have fallen to the Russian army so far - people have been protesting the Russian invasion. On Friday, some residents snubbed Moscow's distribution of humanitarian aim, chanting patriotic slogans and waving Ukrainian flags. ""It was thousands of people, not hundreds,"" one man who attended the protests told the BBC. The BBC has withheld his name for security reasons. ""We chanted that Kherson is Ukraine,"" he told BBC's Newshour. ""People shouted at Russia's military, 'Go home, we don't want you here. We want to live in Ukraine, we want to live with Europe, not with Russia.'"" The man confirmed reports that Russian shoulders fired guns into the air to deter protesters. He said residents do currently have electricity and limited internet. ""We are just living from day-to-day,"" the man said. ""It's still some scary times."" Hospitals across Ukraine are facing threats of supply shortages as the number of wounded grows, said Alex Wade, an emergency co-ordinator with MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res (MSF) to the BBC. ""The situation is incredibly worrying and is certainly getting more worrying by the day,"" Wade said on BBC's Newshour earlier today. ""There are ruptures in what hospitals need to support their patients."" In some cases medical aid has been stymied by the advancing Russian invasion. Some towns - like port city Mariupol - have been cut off from both power and critical interventions from aid agencies like MSF. ""We are no longer able to communicate with the hospital [in Mariupol],"" Wade said. ""And we're very concerned we will lose access to supplying more hospitals in the coming days.""  UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has called for a renewed effort among world leaders to ensure that Russia's invasion of Ukraine fails. Writing in the New York Times, Johnson set out a six-point plan, including rapidly strengthening defences in Nato countries. ""Putin must fail and must be seen to fail in this act of aggression,"" he wrote. ""It is not future historians but the people of Ukraine who will be our judge."" The UK's Labour Party has criticised the prime minister for not acting more quickly with sanctions. Johnson is expected to repeat his pitch to fellow Western leaders this week. He will be meeting withCanadian Prime Minister Justin TrudeauandDutch Prime Minister Mark Rutteon Monday and hosting leaders from theCzech Republic, Hungary, PolandandSlovakiathe following day. Read more about Johnson's plea for Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr
Zelenskiy said today that he had spoken to SpaceX CEO Elon Musk and announced the country will receive more of its Starlink satellite internet terminals this coming week. ""Talked to @elonmusk,"" Zelensky wrote on Twitter. ""Iâm grateful to him for supporting Ukraine with words and deeds. Next week we will receive another batch of Starlink systems for destroyed cities. Discussed possible space projects. But Iâll talk about this after the war."" Starlink provides high-speed internet from space with satellites flying in low Earth orbit. Musk said on
Thursday that the system was the only non-Russian communications
system still working in some parts of Ukraine in the wake of
Russia's invasion. Meanwhile, in an address to the Ukrainian people on Saturday night, Zelensky urged citizens in Russian occupied areas of the country to fight back against Vladimir Putin's military. âUkrainians! In all of our cities, where the enemy invaded, go on the offensive. Go out on the streets. We need to fight every time we have an opportunity,â he said. Tim FranksBBC Newshour, Lviv Fourteen-year-old Mariana is
about to add herself to the more than one million people whoâve fled over the border. Sheâs at Lviv station in Ukraine with her younger sister and aunt, hoping to board a
train to Poland. Itâs been an exhausting two-day trek from her home in
Kharkiv, in the north-east. Sheâs left her parents and her grandparents
behind. And Mariana can barely speak for the tears. âIâm
scared,â she sobs. âMy parents stayed. I really want to see them. I donât want to go to Poland.â Her grandparents were too frail to
leave home. But that home has become unrecognisable. Which is why
Marianaâs mother and father made their agonising decision to part from their
children. Theyâd spent days cowering, hungry and terrified in a basement
as the bombardment closed in. âI donât want this,â Mariana pleads. âPlease stop this. Why should we die?â A US ban on Russian oil will be the first priority for lawmakers, Congressman Mike Quigley told CNN a short while ago. ""The first thing you'll see Congress push for is an embargo,"" he said, noting that around 8% of US oil imports are from Russia. An embargo would be ""traumatic for our European allies"", who are more dependent, the Illinois Democrat said. ""So that's going to take quite a bit of diplomacy."" His comments come after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke with Quigley and more than 300 of his colleagues, calling for a bar on the import of Russian oil. A ban on Russian oil has provided a rare moment of bipartisan co-operation in the US Congress - both Republican and Democratic lawmakers have publicly pressured the Biden administration to implement an embargo. The US is one of the world's biggest oil producers, whereas the EU relies on imports to meet 61% of its energy needs. Shell said today that it made the ""difficult decision"" to purchase a cargo of Russian crude oil to ensure a continued supply of energy to the European market. ""Cargos from alternative sources would not have arrived in time to avoid disruptions to market supply,"" the oil giant said in a statement. It said the firm is facing challenges in shifting from Russian oil ""because of how significant [it] is to global supply"". Shell said it would commit profits from its ""limited amount of Russian oil"" to a dedicated fund going towards humanitarian aid in Ukraine. Shell said earlier this week it will end all of its joint ventures with the Russian energy company Gazprom due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. It said it will also sell its 50% stake in two Siberian oilfield projects. Russian oil exports account for about 8% of global supply. There has been a growing push in recent days for countries to shun Russian oil and gas - a move currently being considered by the United States. Allow Twitter content?

The payments giants Mastercard and Visa have announced that they are suspending their operations in Russia in protest over the invasion of Ukraine. In a statement, Mastercard said that Russian banks would no longer be supported
by its network and any card issued by the company outside of
country would not work at Russian merchants or ATMs. The company said it had listened to representations from partners and taken its decision due to the ""unprecedented nature of the current conflict and the uncertain economic environment"". Meanwhile, Visa said that it would work to cease all transactions in the country in the coming days, adding that Visa cards issued by financial institutions outside of Russia would also stop working in the country' territory. Al Kelly, Visa's CEO and chairman, said the company had been ""compelled to act following Russiaâs unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, and the unacceptable events that we have witnessed"". âWe regret the impact this will have on our valued colleagues, and on the clients, partners, merchants and cardholders we serve in Russia. This war and the ongoing threat to peace and stability demand we respond in line with our values,â he concluded. Taking a step away from the developments on the battlefield in Ukraine for moment, let's look briefly at some news from the football pitch. Head coach of Premiere League football club Chelsea, Thomas Tuchel, has criticised the club's supporters who sang owner Roman Abramovich's name during a minute's applause for Ukraine before their 4-0 win over Burnley today. On WednesdayAbramovich announced his decision to sell the clubamid heavy scrutiny following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. He's alleged to have strong ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, which he has denied. Some Chelsea fans chanted Russian Abramovich's name throughout the game, and were booed by Burnley fans. ""It's not the moment to do this,"" Chelsea manager Tuchel said. ""If we show solidarity we show solidarity and we should do it together.""

David WillisBBC News, Washington Pro-Ukraine supporters have been gathering outside the White House Ukraineâs President Volodymyr Zelensky has repeated a call for a no-fly zone over his country in a video-link address to nearly 300 US lawmakers. He also called for a ban on imports of Russian oil and pleaded for Russian-made fighter jets, which his countryâs pilots know how to fly, to help fight the enemy advance in his country. In response, Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer said he'd help the Biden administration to facilitate their transfer from Eastern Europe Zelensky also underscored the need for additional military support and humanitarian aid, but two of his other requests have already been rejected by the US. Firstly, the no-fly zone which, while cutting off Russian air support, would also risk drawing Nato allies into the conflict. And secondly, the ban on the import of Russian oil which the Biden administration fears could further inflate the price of petrol. The Italian fashion group Prada says it is suspending all retail operations in Russia As we've been reporting, a number of global brands have said they will stop sales in Russia. Luxury brand Prada has now joined them. Other companiessuch as LVMH, Hermes, Kering and Chanel have already confirmed they will shut their shops in the country. Earlier the Spanish-owned business Inditex said it wouldclose all 502 Russian stores of its eight brands, including Zara, Bershka and Stradivarius, from Sunday. Sebastian UsherBBC Arab Affairs Editor Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett travelled to Moscow to hold talks with President Vladimir Putin earlier. The urgency of Bennett's visit was underlined by the fact that the Israeli prime minister - who's an Orthodox Jew - broke Shabbat (the Jewish day of rest) in order to fly to Moscow. Exceptions can only be made under Jewish law in situations in which life is threatened. Bennett's trip was also kept under wraps until he was already in the Kremlin holding some two-and-a-half hours of talks with President Putin. The two men have met several times before and appear to have a good relationship. The Ukrainian President Vlolodymyr Zelensky had earlier called on the Israeli prime minister to mediate in the current conflict. Among those accompanying Bennett was the Housing Minister Zeev Elkin, who has long served as a Russian translator for Israeli leaders.  He was born in Kharkiv and has relatives still in Ukraine. Following the talks, PM Bennett travelled onto Germany where he is set to meet German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. As we've been reporting, the Russian authorities have restricted access to BBC websites in Russian and English, as well as other international and independent media, accusing them of circulating ""false information"" about what is happening in Ukraine. In response, the BBC said ""access to accurate, independent information is a fundamental human right which should not be denied to the people of Russia, millions of whom rely on BBC News every week"". Record numbers of people have read the BBC's Russian language news website since the invasion.

The Russian President has released anInternational Women's Day video,externalwhere he says that conscripts and reservists are not being called up to fight on the frontline. ""Let me emphasise that soldiers who are doing military service do not and
will not participate in hostilities... the assigned taks are solved only be professional military men,"" he said. In contrast, Ukraine's military effort is being heavily staffed by civilian sign-ups. Putin's message was aimed at allaying supposed concerns from Russian women - the ""mothers, wives, sisters, brides and girlfriends of our soldiers and officers who are now in battle."" ""I understand how you worry about your loved ones,"" he said. He broadly characterised women by their ""loyalty, reliability and support"" throughout this speech. ""Our dear women, you make the world better and kinder thanks to your sensitivity, compassion and spiritual generosity. You combine charming tenderness and amazing inner strength."" However, according to a report on 24 February by independent news outlet The Insider, there was evidence that some Russian conscripts had been forced to sign on before the invasion. The BBC has been unable to idependently verify this claim. Graph of most heavily-sanctioned countries in the world Russia has now overtaken Iran and Syria to become the most sanctioned country in the world, according to sanctions watchlist site Castellum.ai. According to the site, 2,754 sanctions were already in place against Russia before 22 February. A further 2,778 sanctions were imposed in the days following the invasion, bringing the total to 5,532 - outranking Iran's 3,616 sanctions and displacing it from the top position. The US made up the primary source of sanctions at 21%, followed closely behind by the UK's and the EU's combined total at 18%. Countries around the world have ramped up sanctions on Russia in an bid to intensify pressure on Moscow to stop its assault on Ukraine. Many residential houses in Kharkiv have been destroyed by Russian shelling Russia will declare a ""silence regime"" and is ready to provide humanitarian corridors in Ukraine at 10:00 Moscow time (07:00 GMT), said Russian state media reports. They are quoting Russian defence ministry officials as saying this will be done to evacuate civilians from the cities of Kyiv, Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv and Mariupol. Most of the evacuation routes offered by Moscow are to Russia - a condition previously described as unacceptable by the government in Kyiv. Ukraine has not publicly commented on the new Russian initiative. Each of several previous evacuation attempts failed, with the warring sides blaming each other. Children are among the victims from aerial attacks on the city of Sumy and its surrounding suburbs late on Monday, according to a local Ukrainian military official. Dmytro Zhyvytsky, who leads the Sumy Regional Military Administration, said in a video posted on Facebook that after 23:00 local time Russian warplanes carried out strikes on the north-eastern city. ""Unfortunately, children are among those killed."" Zhyvytsky said, adding that more than 10 people were killed. The BBC could not independently verify the claims. ""The kids are being killed,"" he wrote in a Facebook post, sharing video of the reported attack. ""We will never forgive this!"" he later added. Australia energy company Viva said on Tuesday it would stop buying Russian crude oil, joining the growing list of companies distancing themselves from Russia in response to its invasion of Ukraine. Viva, which operates under the Shell group of companies, said it was ""appalled"" at ""this terrible conflict"". ""As a consequence .. Viva Energy has made the decision to cease purchases of crude oil of Russian origin while the conflict continues,"" it added. Oil markets, particularly those in Europe, are scrambling to find alternative sources of oil as Russia contributes 13% of the world's crude petroleum exports. US lawmakers are pushing the Biden administration to send its fighter jets to Poland if Warsaw sends its planes to Kyiv. Poland is among a handful of Eastern European allies that retains an inventory of used Russian-made aircraft - which Ukrainian pilots know how to fly - and Ukraine's president has called for their transfer. Warsaw has not yet made a decision to transfer planes to Kyiv and the US government said it was ""Poland's sovereign decision to make"". The White House also added that logistical challenges mean such a transfer would not be ""as easy as just moving planes around"". But Bob Menendez, the US Senate's top lawmaker on foreign relations, called on his government to commit to backfilling the Polish fleet with upgraded aircraft from Washington. ""I will support efforts in the Senate to implement measures to compensate our allies that provide their aircraft for Ukraine's defence,"" he wrote. Reactor No 4 of Chernobyl nuclear power plant seen in an archival image The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has said that, according to Ukrainian officials, a nuclear research facility producing radioisotopes for medical and industrial purposes in Kharkiv has been damaged by shelling. There has been no increase in radiation levels at the facility. IAEA head, Rafael Mariano Grossi, also issued an appeal that staff at Chernobyl be given time off  ""so that they can carry out their work in a safe and reliable manner"". The nuclear agency said staff at the inactive plant, the site of a nuclear disaster in 1986, have continued to work there since Russian forces took control of the facility on 24 February. Grossi  said he is willing to visit Chernobyl ""to obtain guarantees regarding the safety and security of all nuclear power plants in Ukraine from the parties to the conflict"". The World Bank has approved emergency financing of $723m (Â£552m) to help Ukraine's government pay public-sector wages, welfare and pensions. The bank said the package incorporated funding from the UK, Netherlands, Sweden, Japan, Denmark, Latvia, Lithuania and Iceland. The World Bank also says it is working to release a further $3bn (Â£2.3bn) for Ukraine and its neighbouring countries in the coming months.

The bloc currently imports nearly half of its gas and coal, and about a third of its oil, from Russia. EU leaders will discuss the proposed phase-out this Thursday and Friday at a gathering in Versailles, France. A draft statement reportedly refers to Russia's invasion of Ukraine as ""a tectonic shift in European history"". It sets out an objective of ""reducing our dependencies and designing a new growth and investment model for 2030"" by accelerating the development of renewables as well as by diversifying energy supplies and routes. Other Western leaders are also scrambling to prepare for potential shocks to global energy markets. Earlier on Monday, British PM Boris Johnson urged a ""step-by-step"" move away from dependence on Russian oil and gas. The US, which imports about 8% of its oil from Russia, has recently been trying to cut deals with major oil-exporting nations like Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Iran.

An attempt to get the medical student out of Sumy in a minivan on Sunday failed after the vehicle was unable to get into the city. Racheal - who has been sheltering in her university's bunker during air raid sirens - says she is now mentally ""blocking out"" the airstrikes and shelling. ""It does happen so frequently at this point that you kind of don't have time to be afraid anymore,""she tells BBC News NI. Her family have been calling for more help from the Irish government to bring her home. The Irish Department of Foreign Affairs says it is aware of 52 Irish citizens in Ukraine and was in contact with them. Almost 300 Ukrainians have been turned away while trying to cross to the UK from Calais, France. The number is almost the same as the total number of Ukrainian visas issued so far by the Home Office. Many refugees seek to cross the border from France to the UK through the port of Calais. About 589 people have arrived there since Russia's invasion of Ukraine began, according to Calais' sub-prefect, VÃ©ronique Deprez-Boudier. She said 286 had been turned away by UK authorities. Some Ukrainians in Calais have told the BBC they face a wait of a week for an appointment to get a family reunion visa. But the Home Office insists visa application centres across Europe have appointments available this week. âItâs important to build a more organised team to accompany these people to get a visa here,"" Deprez-Boudier told BBC News. Some 17,700 people have applied to come to the UK as part of the Ukrainian Family Scheme, and 300 visas have been issued. Earlier on Monday UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Britain was a ""very generous country"", but it wanted to maintain checks on who was arriving. Read more on Ukrainian refugees in Calaishere. Ukrainian military intelligence says Vitaly Gerasimov died near Kharkiv A top commander in the Russian army has been killed during fighting near Kharkiv, according to Ukraine's ministry of defence intelligence service. The BBC cannot independently verify the claim; Russian officials have not commented. According to a statement from Ukraineâs defence ministry, Vitaly Gerasimov was a major general, chief of staff and first deputy commander of the 41st Army of the Central Military District of Russia. A number of senior Russian army officers were also killed and wounded, it says. Ukrainian intelligence says Gerasimov took part in the second Chechen war and the Russian military operation in Syria. He received a medal ""for the return of Crimea"". Ukrainian officials tweeted out a photo of someone they said was Gerasimov, with the word ""Liquidated"" in red letters across the bottom.

China has always said repeatedly that it does not interfere in the internal affairs of others French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz are expected to hold a joint call with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Tuesday. The call signals a ramping up of pressure by European leaders on China over the Russia-Ukraine conflict. On Monday, European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell spoke with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi for the second time since the invasion began. According to a readout of their call, Borrell asked Wang about ""Chinaâs readiness to support cessation of hostilities and dialogue"" and support for establishing humanitarian corridors to safely evacuate civilians. China has expressed ""regret"" over the attack, but has done little to condemn or oppose Moscow, in line with the principles of its foreign policy. Read more: Can China do more to stop Russia's war in Ukraine? Stephen McDonellBBC News, China correspondent There are two questions regarding China and
the war in Ukraine. Does it have enough leverage to convince Russian President Vladimir Putin to call off the invasion? And, more crucially, how much does Beijing
want to use its standing with Russia to stop the war? Every year here in the Chinese capital, the foreign minister holds a press conference on the sidelines of the National
People's Congress. It is a highly scripted event, with
questions screened beforehand so you know the answers have been approved at the
highest levels of the Party. Today Wang Yi was asked if China was
disappointed with Russiaâs behaviour and whether its own international standing
had been diminished by Beijing's refusal to describe what is happening in
Ukraine as an ""invasion"". The foreign minister didn't respond
regarding the word ""invasion"", but did say that his government was ""willing if
needed, together with the international community, to be part of a mediation"" process to resolve the crisis. Some analysts say Beijing is using this
conflict to achieve geopolitical advantage and point to the economic lifeline
it's now offering Russia to keep Putin afloat, while blaming the US for
the war. Asked about sanctions by a Russian reporter, Wang said China and Russia jointly opposed ""attempts to revive a cold war
mindset"". For the Chinese government to be part of any
solution to the Ukraine war, it will also have to be a solution that is
approved by the Kremlin. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,0.10870975
"Successive US presidents have struggled to get the measure of Vladimir Putin but now that Brussels and Berlin have joined the fray with such resolve, it's a different story, writes Nick Bryant. It is often tempting to look upon Vladimir Putin as the millennium bug in a human and deadly form. The Russian president rose to power on 31 December 1999, as the world held its breath that computers would go into meltdown when the clock struck midnight, unable to process the change from 1999 to 2000. In the 20 years since, Putin has been trying to engineer a different kind of global system malfunction, the destruction of the liberal international order. The former KGB spymaster wanted to turn back the clock: to revive Russia's tsarist greatness and to restore the might and menace of the Soviet Union prior to its break-up in 1991. This Russian revanchist has become the most disruptive international leader of the 21st Century, the mastermind behind so much misery from Chechnya to Crimea, from Syria to the cathedral city of Salisbury. He has sought - successfully at times - to redraw the map of Europe. He has tried - successfully at times - to immobilise the United Nations. He has been determined - successfully at times - to weaken America, and hasten its division and decline. Follow the latest updates from inside Ukraine Putin came to power at a moment of western hubris. The United States was the sole superpower in a unipolar world. Francis Fukuyama's End of History thesis, proclaiming the triumph of liberal democracy, was widely accepted. Some economists even peddled the theory that recessions would be no more, partly because of the productivity gains of the new digital economy. It was also thought that globalisation, and the interdependence it wrought, would stop major economic powers fighting wars. The same utopianism attached itself to the internet, which was seen overwhelmingly as a force for global good. An honour guard greets Air Force One on the Moscow tarmac in 2002 In the early days especially, the same misplaced optimism and wishful thinking coloured the west's approach to Putin - a figure, it is now obvious, who was trying to buck history and thwart democratisation, however many lives were lost in the process. Successive US presidents have played into his hands. Bill Clinton, the occupant of the White House when Putin came to power, handed this ultra-nationalist a popular grievance by pushing for the expansion of Nato right up to Russia's borders. As George F Kennan, the famed architect of America's Cold War strategy of containment, warned at the time: ""Expanding Nato would be the most fateful error of America policy in the entire post-Cold War era."" Why Biden won't send troops to Ukraine George W Bush completely misjudged his Russian counterpart. ""I looked the man in the eye,"" Bush famously said after their first meeting in Slovenia in 2001. ""I found him very straightforward and trustworthyâ¦ I was able to get a sense of his soul."" Bush mistakenly thought he could mount a charm offensive with Putin, and gently cajole him further down the democratic path. But even though Bush visited Russia more than any other country - including, as a personal favour, two trips in 2002 to Putin's home city, St Petersburg - the Russian leader was already displaying dangerously despotic tendencies. In 2008, Bush's final year as president, Putin invaded Georgia - what he called a ""peace enforcement operation"". The Kremlin argued then - and has continued to argue ever since - that it was hypocritical for Washington to complain about this violation of international law after Bush had invaded Iraq. George Bush hosted Vladimir Putin at his Texas ranch... ...which caused some excitement locally Barack Obama sought to reframe US-Russian relations. His first secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, even handed her Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov a mock reset button (which was mistakenly labelled with the Russian word for ""overloaded""). But Putin knew that America, after its long wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, no longer wanted to police the world. When Obama refused in 2013 to enforce his red-line warning against Bashar al-Assad when the Syrian dictator used chemical weapons against his own people, Putin saw a green light. By helping Assad carry out his murderous war, he extended Moscow's sphere of influence in the Middle East when the United States wanted to extract itself from the region. The following year, he annexed Crimea, and established a foothold in eastern Ukraine. Despite being told by Obama to ""cut it out,"" Putin even sought to influence the outcome of the 2016 presidential election in the hope that Hillary Clinton, a long-time nemesis, would be defeated and that Donald Trump, a long-time fan boy, would win. The New York property tycoon made no secret of his admiration for Putin, a sycophantic approach that seems to have further emboldened the Russian president. Much to Moscow's delight, Trump publicly criticised Nato, weakened the US post-war alliance system and became such a polarising figure that he left America more politically divided than at any time since the Civil War. LIVE:Latest updates from on the ground IN KYIV:Locals fear another Grozny or Aleppo EXPLAINED:Why Putin has invaded Ukraine? IN DEPTH:Full coverage of the conflict Arguably, then, you have to reach back 30 years to find a US leader whose approach to the Kremlin has stood the test of time. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, George Herbert Walker Bush resisted the temptation to rejoice in America's Cold War victory - much to the astonishment of the White House press pack, he refused to travel to Berlin for a victory lap - knowing that it would bolster hardliners in the Politburo and military seeking to oust Mikhail Gorbachev. That magnanimity in victory helped when it came to bringing about the reunification of Germany, which was arguably Bush's greatest foreign policy success. Putin is obviously a more formidable adversary, harder to deal with than even Leonid Brezhnev or Nikita Khrushchev, the Soviet premier during the Cuban Missile Crisis. But since the turn of the century no US president has truly had his measure. Bill Clinton pushed for the expansion of Nato which some said was a mistake Joe Biden, like George Herbert Walker Bush, is a Cold War warrior, who has dedicated his presidency to defending democracy at home and abroad. Seeking to re-establish America's traditional post-war role as the leader of the free world, he has sought to mobilise the international community, offered military aid to Ukraine and adopted the toughest sanction regime ever targeted against Putin. As Russian forces amassed at the border, he also shared US intelligence showing that Putin had decided to invade, in ways that sought to disrupt the Kremlin's usual misinformation campaigns and false flag operations. His State of the Union address became a rallying cry. ""Freedom will always triumph over tyranny,"" he said. And while Biden does not speak with the clarity or force of a Kennedy or a Reagan, it was nonetheless a significant speech. What's been striking since the Russian invasion started, however, has been the assertion of forceful presidential leadership from elsewhere. Volodymyr Zelensky has been lauded and lionised, as he has continued this extraordinary personal journey from comedian to Churchillian colossus. Zelensky: A comedian president rising to the moment In Brussels, the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has been another commanding presence. This former German politician has been a driving force behind the decision, for the first time in EU history, to finance and purchase weapons for a nation under attack, a commitment that includes not just ammunition but fighter jets as well. Ursula von der Leyen Her compatriot, the new Chancellor of Germany Olaf Scholz, has also shown more resolve in dealing with Putin than his predecessor Angela Merkel. At warp speed, he has overturned decades of post-Cold War German foreign policy, an approach so often predicated on caution and timidity towards the Russian leader. Berlin has sent anti-tank and anti-aircraft systems to Ukraine (ending the policy of not sending weapons to active war zones), halted the Nord Stream 2 Baltic Sea gas pipeline project, withdrawn its opposition to blocking Russia from the SWIFT international payments system, and even committed to spending 2% of its GDP on defence spending. Putin's war prompts dramatic German U-turn The biggest assault on a European state since World War Two has stiffened European resolve. But so, too, it seems has the relative weakness of America. Mindful of the botched US withdrawal from Afghanistan and possibility of a Trump 2.0 presidency, European leaders seem to have realised that they can no longer lean so heavily on Washington to defend democracy in this hour of maximum peril. Leadership of the free world has, in this crisis, become a common endeavour. Even since the end of the Cold War, Washington has been calling upon European nations to do more to police its own neighbourhood, something they failed to do when the break-up of the former Yugoslavia sparked the Bosnian war. Historians may well conclude that it took a combination of Putin's aggressiveness, America's fragility, Ukraine's heroic resolve and the fear that Europe's post-war stability is truly on the line to finally make that happen. This video can not be played Watch: What Americans think of Biden's Ukraine response It would be naive to be swept away by the romanticism of Zelensky's speeches or to succumb to the dopamine high of watching the seizure of Russian-owned super-yachts unfold on social media. Putin is intensifying the war. But the last week has sent a message to Moscow - and to Beijing as well - that the post-war international order still continues to function, despite the deployment of the Russian war machine to bring about its collapse.

"A little girl clutches a doll at a checkpoint on the Ukraine-Slovakia border In Ukraine, families are having to adapt to a terrifying new reality. How do you tell young children that you're at war? Ten days ago Anton Eine, a science fiction writer in Ukraine, had been due to launch his latest book - but then the Russians invaded. Now, he says, none of that matters any more. He is hunkering down in Kyiv with his wife and their three-year-old son. They live in a 24-storey apartment block with an underground car park, where people are sleeping on the concrete floor. It's bitterly cold, and Anton is worried about what might happen if the building collapses, so he and his family feel safer in a square concrete well between the lifts. That has become their sanctuary during the constant air raid sirens. They bring toys and their son's tablet and make sure he sits in the corner, which is the safest place. Anton says their son is worried, and asks lots of questions. ""Yesterday, my wife went downstairs and when she returned, he was asking, 'Mum, did they shoot you?' and she said 'No baby', and he said, 'Will they shoot me? I don't want them to go bang-bang'."" How to deal with your anxiety about the Ukraine crisis Anton says some parents have sewn badges with their child's blood group on to their clothes and are teaching them their home address and parents' names, in case they are separated. And while they hide in shelters or try to board trains to safety, many parents are also talking to each other about how the war is affecting their children, and how best to protect them from trauma. ""Some parents tell the kids it's a game,"" says Anton. ""We are trying to tell our son the truth, but in a softer way, adapted to the mind of a three-year-old kid. ""We tell him that bad soldiers attacked us and the good soldiers, the ones with the Ukrainian flag, are the ones who protect us, and you don't need to worry here in this sanctuary."" His own son's drawings don't appear to show any signs of trauma, but some of Anton's friends have older children, and the pictures they draw clearly show they've been affected by the situation. A friend of Anton's shared her four-year-old son's drawing after spending the night in a bomb shelter - it shows people fleeing a big red devil The parents and staff from his son's nursery stay in touch via the social media app Telegram, where they share advice about how to talk to the children about what's going on. This even included a tutorial on how to explain to the kids why it was OK for adults to swear now, while it was not OK in normal life. ""Because people are swearing right now,"" says Anton. They have become more relaxed about other little things, too. ""Because of this situation, he has to watch much more cartoons than normal, and is eating much more sweets than normal. We need something to occupy him - he has to not pay too much attention to what's going on. ""The psychologists advise us to be gentler with kids in these times, and to love them much more than usual,"" says Anton. When it comes to safety, though, they have to be quite strict. Their three-year-old quickly learned that when there's a siren, the family have to run and hide. ""As soon as we hear sirens or get a notification we shout, 'To the shelter!' and whatever he's doing he leaves it and runs. He understands that the situation is extraordinary. It even surprises us how well children understand the necessity to behave properly."" Evacuees and a child, sitting on top of a suitcase, wait for a train to Romania from Lviv As the Russian shelling gets worse and the convoys close in, many Ukrainian parents have decided to flee their homes with their young children in tow. Hanna, a scientist, left Kyiv and travelled to Poland with her two sons, who are eight and six years old. For days, they had been at home listening to explosions, the windows trembling, and she somehow had to tell them what was going on. She found it hard to strike a balance between reality and how much a child's mind can take. ""This was a challenge for me as a mother because I have to choose between how to explain the truth, but at the same time not to scare them too much,"" she says. ""So I was just telling them that we are under attack, and at the moment we are safe, but when we feel we have to move, they have to listen."" Her parenting style had to change, too - there was no room for discussion. ""Normally I ask them to do something, but this is a time to get orders."" A child on a swing outside a residential building in Kyiv damaged by a missile After a few days of shelling, Hanna felt she no longer wanted her children to hear the bombs and decided to leave Ukraine. ""It was a very, super hard decision,"" she says. Her children had to make a hard decision too - they could only take one of their toys. Her eldest chose Toothless, a toy dragon from the How to Train your Dragon series, and her youngest chose a Transformer toy car that turns into a robot. It was a huge decision for them, says Hanna - perhaps as momentous as it was for her to leave her country. ""I think that we were in the same emotional decision-taking position."" It took them 52 hours to reach safety in Poland. Hanna's ex-husband came with them for the first part of the car journey but then had to turn back, to fight. Hanna says travelling in a war zone with two kids was exhausting and she can understand why many of her friends are choosing to stay nearer home. Now they are safe, but the boys ask lots of questions, about their grandparents and especially their father, who has stayed behind. ""Heart-breaking questions, because they ask me every day if he is alive, or if he still has his hands and legs. They are afraid that he can get super hurt.""

IN DEPTH:Full coverage of the conflict Hanna tells them to try and live in the present. ""All we have is just now. At the moment we are safe,"" she says. How much to tell their children is something all parents are having to weigh up. Oksana fled her home town of Lviv, in the west, and is now also in Poland. Her six-year-old daughter is autistic and hates loud noises, so she found the air raid sirens very scary. She could tell her mother was nervous too, so Oksana told her the truth about what was happening. ""I was explaining that it's a war and we need to be safe, and that a lot of people are dead now because of all this,"" says Oksana. ""I think it is important that when children are old enough to understand they are not misled, because they can sense the atmosphere is bad."" Iryna's son is just two, and she has decided not to tell him too much. After spending three nights in a bomb shelter they left Irpin, a small city near Kyiv, and went to western Ukraine. She told her son they were going to stay with friends, because he's too young to understand that they're in danger. ""I didn't tell him that it's a war. I'm not sure I have to when he's so young, because I think it makes this situation only worse."" As for Anton and his family, the Russian troops are closing in and they may have to evacuate soon. He's not sure where to. ""No-one knows which place is the safest - so it's gambling,"" he says. Hanna, Oksana and Iryna spoke toOutside Source on the BBC World Service.
