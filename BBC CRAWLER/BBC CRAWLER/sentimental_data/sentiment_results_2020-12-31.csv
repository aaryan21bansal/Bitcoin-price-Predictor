"Gibraltar relies on thousands of Spanish workers commuting daily Spain has reached a deal with the UK to maintain free movement to and from Gibraltar once the UK formally leaves the EU on Friday. To avoid a hard border, Gibraltar will join the EU's Schengen zone and follow other EU rules, while remaining a British Overseas Territory. The deal was announced by Spanish Foreign Minister Arancha GonzÃ¡lez Laya, just hours before the UK exits the EU. The Rock voted Remain in 2016 and about 15,000 Spanish workers go there daily. ""With this [agreement], the fence is removed, Schengen is applied to Gibraltar... it allows for the lifting of controls between Gibraltar and Spain,"" said Ms GonzÃ¡lez Laya. The Gibraltar deal will mean the EU sending Frontex border guards to facilitate free movement to and from Gibraltar. Their role is planned to last four years. Gibraltarians are British citizens. They elect their own representatives to the territory's parliament, while the British monarch appoints a governor. The territory - home to a British military garrison and naval base - is self-governing in all areas except defence and foreign policy. UK 'ready for new start' as EU deadline approaches A quick guide to what's in the Brexit deal Ms GonzÃ¡lez Laya did not say whether Spanish border guards would eventually be posted at Gibraltar's airport and/or seaport which, under the deal, will be de facto part of the EU's external border. The Gibraltar deal would also mean the territory complying with EU fair competition rules in areas such as financial policy, the environment and the labour market, Ms GonzÃ¡lez Laya said. Twenty-two EU states are in the passport-free Schengen zone, as are Norway, Switzerland, Iceland and Liechtenstein, but the UK has never been in it. Once Gibraltar joins it, EU citizens arriving from Spain or another Schengen country will avoid passport checks, while arrivals from the UK will have to go through passport control, as is already the case. UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab called Thursday's deal a ""political framework"" to form the basis of a separate treaty with the EU regarding Gibraltar. This video can not be played Why Gibraltar is British - in 60 secs The deal does not address the thorny issue of sovereignty. Spain has long disputed British sovereignty over the Rock which was ceded to Britain in 1713 and which is now home to about 34,000 people. The Remain vote there was an overwhelming 96% in the 2016 EU referendum. The plan is to have a six-month transition period and then formalise the new arrangements with a treaty. Under the current tight Covid rules,there are restrictions on UK citizens arriving via Gibraltar's airport,external, the UK Foreign Office says. Dominic Raab said ""all sides are committed to mitigating the effects of the end of the [Brexit] Transition Period on Gibraltar, and in particular ensure border fluidity, which is clearly in the best interests of the people living on both sides. ""We remain steadfast in our support for Gibraltar, and its sovereignty is safeguarded.""

MF Doom was born in London but moved to New York as a child. As a teenager he performed in hip-hop group KMD. Following the loss of his younger brother and bandmate DJ Subroc, he disappeared from music becoming, in his own words, ""damn near homeless"". But in 1997, he remerged at open mic events in Manhattan, wearing tights over his face. He protected his anonymity for the rest of his career, adopting a mask based on the Marvel villain Doctor Doom for all his public appearances. His debut as MF Doom, Operation: Doomsday, was released in 1999, and he followed it up with an almost non-stop outpouring of music. As well as six solo albums, he produced a wealth of bootlegs, compilations, collaborations, mixtapes and instrumental albums - including the influential, 10-part Special Herbs series. He may be best known for 2004's Madvillainy, which was recorded with crate-digging producer Madlib under the moniker Madvillain, and gave the rapper his first entry on the US album chart. Another of his high-profile collaborations was Danger Doom alongside DJ Danger Mouse, and he appeared with Damon Albarn's Gorillaz on their UK number one album Demon Days. Other collaborators included Ghostface Killah, Flying Lotus, The Avalanches and Radiohead. One of hip-hop's most respected MCs, he made appearances on BBC Radio 4 and Radio 1 in which hediscussed his own music and projects with other artists.

"Wiradjuri woman Olivia Fox sang the national anthem in indigenous language Dharug in December Australians will sing a different version of their national anthem from 1 January after Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced a change to the words on Thursday. The anthem will no longer refer to Australia as ""young and free"" - in an attempt to reflect the country's long indigenous history. The announcement was a surprise but welcomed across the government. Mr Morrison said he hopes the change will create a""spirit of unity"".,external People inhabited Australia for tens of thousands of years before it was colonised by mostly white English settlers in the 18th Century. The line to be removed in the anthem, which is called Advance Australia Fair, is ""For we are young and free"". Instead people will sing ""For we are one and free."" Earlier this year, the leader of New South Wales state, Premier Gladys Berejiklian, suggested the change, saying the current wording ignored Australia's ""proud First Nations culture"". Aboriginal Australians 'still suffering effects of colonial past' First Aboriginal cricketer inducted to Hall of Fame Museum returns 'stolen' sacred Aboriginal artefacts ""Changing 'young and free' to 'one and free' takes nothing away, but I believe it adds much,"" Prime Minister Morrison, who is a conservative, said.

"There is ""absolutely no reason"" schools in England will not be ready to mass test pupils when they return next term, the education secretary has said. Gavin Williamson said he wanted school closures to be as ""short as possible"" afterdelaying their reopeningamid surging coronavirus cases. It comes as people are being warnednot to gather on New Year's Eve. Some 20 million people in England have been told to ""stay at home"" after tier four was expanded at midnight. They join the 24 million already in the toughest restrictions - meaning non-essential businesses must close, and people should stay home unless they have a ""reasonable excuse"". How will mass testing help schools? Where has the new school term been delayed? We've all seen this coming, say angry heads Which areas are going into tier four and what are the rules? On Thursday the UK recorded a further 55,892 new Covid cases, as well as 964 more deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Defending the delay to term, Mr Williamson said the government was ""battling this hidden enemy"" - and that there was Â£78m of funding for schools to get testing up and running. Equipment such as personal protective equipment (PPE) would be delivered next week andthere would be support from the military. But teaching unions saidthe move did not go far enough, and one labelled it ""another last-minute mess"". Meanwhile an intensive care doctor has urged people not to gather ahead of the New Year and said those who do not follow social distancing rules or wear maskshave ""blood on their hands"". Prof Hugh Montgomery, professor of intensive care medicine at University College London, said: ""It is making me actually very angry now that people are laying the blame on the virus, and it is not the virus, it is people, people are not washing their hands, they are not wearing their masks."" NHS England medical director Prof Stephen Powis said it was ""absolutely vital"" people stayed home and did not mix, saying ""Covid loves a crowd"". Health Secretary Matt Hancock said people must take ""personal responsibility"". England's tier four restrictions mean people cannot meet other households indoors, unless they are part of a support bubble, while hospitality businesses and those such as hairdressers and nail bars must shut. In Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said thereshould be ""no gatherings, no house parties"" for Hogmanayas all of the mainland remains in the highest level of restrictions. Asix-week lockdownbegan in Northern Ireland on 26 December, while Wales also has a national lockdown with people banned from visiting other households. TESTING:How do I get a virus test? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters SCHOOLS:What will happen if children catch coronavirus? The warnings came after the UK announced theapproval of a second vaccine for coronavirus, the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab,with the first doses due to be given on Monday. The latest figures show 786,000 people have received the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine between 8 December and 27 December, NHS England said. GPs are to be offered Â£10 for every care home resident vaccinated and NHS staff will also be prioritised now that the Oxford jab has been approved, the health service said. Deepti Gurdasani, epidemiologist and senior lecturer at Queen Mary University of London, told BBC Radio 5 Live there appeared to be a ""bottleneck"" in the delivery of the jabs with the volume of vaccines given was ""six times lower"" than the two million per week target. A total of 232,169 people tested positive for Covid in England at least once in the week to 23 December, up 33% on the previous week and the highest weekly rise on record,the latest NHS Test and Trace figures show,external. Covid case rates are continuing to rise in all regions of England - with London's rate at 735.5 per 100,000 people in the seven days to 27 December, up from 711.9 the previous week, the latest Public Health England (PHE) surveillance report showed. Eastern England saw the second highest rate, 551.3 up from 510.8, followed by south-east England at 450.6, up from 427.4. PHE medical director Dr Yvonne Doyle said Christmas week had seen a worrying rise in cases, adding ""we must not now add further fuel on the fire"" by meeting in groups for New Year's Eve. Meanwhile, the NHS in London has been asked to make sure the London Nightingale hospital is ""reactivated and ready to admit patients"", an NHS spokesman said. Mr Williamson announced on Wednesday that secondary schools across most of England are to remain closed for an extra two weeks for most pupils, to help regain control of coronavirus amid concernsabout a fast-spreading new variant. Some primary schools in Covid hot-spots,externalwill not reopen on Monday, he said, but the Department for Education confirmed on Thursday there would be a review every two weeks. The education secretary told BBC Breakfast that remote learning would be ""mandatory"" from the week commencing 11 January for all secondary students, other than years 11 and 13 who would physically return to school on that date. As soon as news emerged of the new faster-spreading variant questions began to be asked about schools. An analysis by Public Health England released this week showed there was no evidence it was more able to infect children than other variants. But that does not mean infection rates have not been rising among children. As with all age groups, the proportion of school children testing positive increased during December - with more virus around, there was more transmission. Primary school children however still remain one of the age groups with the lowest infection rates, according to Public Health England analysis of people who test positive. This of course is likely to miss asymptomatic cases and random testing by the Office for National Statistics suggests infection levels could be higher. Regardless of this, the sheer scale of the infection levels in the worst-hit areas means ministers wanted to buy themselves time, hence some primaries will remain closed. If large numbers of pupils and staff need to isolate, it makes the smooth-running of schools impractical. Ministers are hoping mass testing coupled with the tougher restrictions - three-quarters of England are now in the highest tier - will be enough to curb infection levels and keep a lid on the spread in schools. But it is clear they will have to tread carefully to achieve that. Mr Williamson said more than 85% of primary schools were reopening on Monday and he wanted any closures to be ""short"". Meanwhile, council leaders said plans toclose primary schools in 22 London boroughs but not in 10 othershave ""no logic"". A Department for Education spokesperson said decisions on which areas were affected by the changes to school reopening plans were based on the number of new infections, positivity rates and pressures on the NHS.

"People should take ""personal responsibility"" and stay at home this New Year's Eve to avoid spreading Covid-19, the health secretary says. With the NHS under increasing pressure, Matt Hancock said ""we cannot let up"". It comes as around 20 million more people in England entered the toughest level of restrictions at midnight. They join 24 million who were already living under tier four rules, which include a ""stay at home"" order and the closure of non-essential shops. In tier four areas, people are not allowed to mix with other households indoors or in most outdoor venues, although an individual can meet one other person in an open public space. Different households are also prohibited from mixing indoors in tiers two and three. The Isles of Scilly is the only area currently in tier one, where groups of up to six people are allowed to mix indoors and outdoors. The UK reported 55,892 new Covid cases on Thursday -the highest daily number of cases recorded yet. However, the infection rate during the first peak in spring is thought to have been higher than official figures suggested as testing was much more limited then. A further 964 deaths within 28 days of a positive test have also been recorded. Meanwhile, the start of the new school term in England has been delayed amid concerns about a fast-spreading new variant. Education Secretary Gavin Williamsonsaid he wanted school closures to be as ""short as possible"", after he announced primary pupils in the most at-risk areas of England will not return as planned on Monday. Secondary schools will also remain closed for an extra two weeks for most pupils, although Years 11 and 13 will return on 11 January. What are the lockdown and tier four rules? New coronavirus variant: What do we know? Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live A government advertising campaign to ""See in the new year safely at home"" is running throughout Thursday, urging people not to meet up with friends or family indoors, unless they are in the same household or bubble, and to avoid large gatherings. The adverts remind the public that about one in three people who have Covid-19 have no symptoms, so people should act like they have the virus to avoid spreading it without realising. Mr Hancock said: ""With our NHS under pressure we must all take personal responsibility this New Year's Eve and stay at home. ""I know how much we have all sacrificed this year and we cannot let up. Over 600,000 people have now been vaccinated and we are close to beating this virus. ""Now more than ever, we need to pull together to save lives and protect our NHS. If we continue to do our bit by staying at home, we can get through this together."" The Metropolitan Police issued a warning to potential revellers in London to ""celebrate the new year in the comfort of their own homes, not the homes of family and friends"". Commander Paul Brogden, who is leading this year's operation, said fines would be issued where necessary to any rule-breakers. In Brighton,people have been told not to attend a New Year's Eve party on the seafront, after a group called Protest Everywhere advertised a ""freedom protest street party"". Sussex Police said it would intervene to enforce restrictions on gatherings. While the changes to England's tier system came into force at 00:01 GMT on Thursday, Wales andNorthern Irelandremain in strict lockdown. The Welsh Ambulance Servicewarned ""no party is worth the risk"", with the health service under ""extreme pressure"". In Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has urged people not to celebrate Hogmanay in the traditional wayamid a lockdown across the mainland. The streets of Edinburgh will be empty for the first time in recent memory following the cancellation of its world famous street party, with only online events planned. Covid dampens New Year celebrations around world France plans mass New Year's Eve crackdown On Wednesday, Prof Stephen Powis, NHS England's national medical director, said it was ""vital"" people followed the guidance by staying at home and not mixing with other households.

"The first lorries to transport freight under the new arrangements arrived in Belfast on Friday afternoon The first goods have crossed the new trade border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. The'Irish Sea border' is a consequence of Brexitand means that most commercial goods entering NI from GB require a customs declaration. About a dozen lorries arrived on a ferry from Cairnryan in Scotland to Belfast at 14:00 GMT on Friday. They were met by officials, with some vehicles directed to new border control posts. Many food products from GB now have to enter NI through these border posts where they can be inspected by the Department of Agriculture. These products also need health certificates, though some of the new certification processes will be phased in over the next three months. The UK government also announced a three-month ""grace period"" for parcels, meaning those sent by online retailers will be exempt from customs declarations until at least April. It said the grace period was necessary to avoid disruption to deliveries at a time when many shops are closed due to pandemic restrictions. Meanwhile the secretary of state for Northern Ireland has continued to insist the new range of checks, controls and paperwork is not actually a sea border. Brandon Lewis tweeted: ""There is no 'Irish Sea Border'. As we have seen today, the important preparations the government and businesses have taken to prepare for the end of the Transition Period are keeping goods flowing freely around the country, including between GB and NI.""

Transport companies are not expecting significant volumes of freight over the next few days. There has been significant stockpiling ahead of the changes and it may take one or two weeks before freight volumes are at normal seasonal levels. Some businesses, particularly haulage companies, are anxious about the new IT systems which are necessary for the border to function. They have had less than two weeks to familiarise themselves with the new systems. Police officers carried out random vehicle checks near Larne Port on New Year's Eve Seamus Leheny from Logistics UK said: ""With any reconfiguration of supply chains and new systems there will be teething problems and we expect that."" There will be no new processes or checks for the vast majority of goods leaving NI for GB. Five steps that led to an Irish Sea border Why a Brexit trade deal is different for NI IT systems for post-Brexit trade 'up and running' The new arrangements flow from the Northern Ireland Protocol, a deal reached by the UK and EU in 2019. Its purpose is to prevent a hard land border in Ireland. That is achieved by keeping Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods and by having Northern Ireland apply EU customs rules at its ports. This will allow goods to flow from NI to the Republic of Ireland and the rest of the EU as they do now, without customs checks or new paperwork. The Protocol is opposed by Northern Ireland's unionist parties who fear it will weaken Northern Ireland's position in the UK. The arrangement does not change Northern Ireland's constitutional position. However, it does mean a significant new economic barrier within the UK. Unionist parties fear the sea border will weaken NI's position in the UK The UK government has allocated more than Â£300m for a Trader Support Service to help businesses deal with the new customs arrangements. The government is also covering the costs of the new certification requirements for food products. A Movement Assistance Scheme will pay vets up to Â£150 to complete the Export Health Certificates which will need to accompany all live animals and products of animal origin entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain. Trucks pass through a customs post at Dublin Port on Friday morning There are also new checks and controls on freight arriving at Dublin Port from GB. On Friday morning, the first ferry to arrive in Dublin from Holyhead had about 12 lorries on board. While they all cleared customs checks for the first time without delays, Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney said the change in trading arrangements with the UK would inevitably cause disruption. ""We have avoided the kind of dramatic disruption of a no trade deal Brexit, but that doesn't mean that things aren't changing very fundamentally, because they are,"" he said. ""We're now going to see the â¬80b (Â£71.2bn) worth of trade across the Irish Sea between Britain and Ireland disrupted by an awful lot more checks and declarations, and bureaucracy and paperwork, and cost and delay."" On Saturdaynew freight sailings will begin between Rosslare in the Republic of Ireland and Dunkirk in France, allowing cargo to bypass GB and go straight to mainland Europe. The six-times weekly service will take 24 hours, which is longer than the ""landbridge"" route via GB.

"The UK's chief medical officers have defended the Covid vaccination plan, after criticism from a doctors' union. The UK will give both parts of the Oxford and Pfizer vaccines 12 weeks apart, having initially planned to leave 21 days between the Pfizer jabs. The British Medical Association said cancelling patients booked in for their second doses was""grossly unfair"". But the chief medical officers said getting more people vaccinated with the first jab ""is much more preferable"". The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was the first jab approved in the UK, and 944,539 people have had their first jab. The first person to get the jab on 8 December, Margaret Keenan,has already had her second jab. Rapid rollout call after second Covid jab approval How do the vaccines compare? When will you be eligible for the Covid vaccine? Pfizer has said it has tested the vaccine's efficacy only when the two vaccines were given up to 21 days apart. But the chief medical officers said the ""great majority"" of initial protection came from the first jab. ""The second vaccine dose is likely to be very important for duration of protection, and at an appropriate dose interval may further increase vaccine efficacy,"" they said. ""In the short term, the additional increase of vaccine efficacy from the second dose is likely to be modest; the great majority of the initial protection from clinical disease is after the first dose of vaccine."" It comes as: The UK has seen a surge in the number of daily cases,with a record 55,892 reported on Thursday A fireworks and light display to welcome 2021has taken place over London, but revellers were not able to ring in the New Year in the usual way because of the coronavirus pandemic The leaders of eight London boroughs are urging the government to delaythe reopening of primary schools, saying it's unfair they are resuming classes when boroughs with lower infection rates are not Ministers say they want to see schools open at the earliest opportunity The decision to delay the second dose has, understandably, caused concern. There is some evidence regulators say - at least for the Oxford vaccine - that it will actually boost immunity. But for those who are due to get a second dose soon it will undoubtedly be upsetting that they now have to wait. But the move is about practicalities. The UK is in the middle of a public health crisis and despite the fact that millions of doses are pre-ordered, there is concern the supply of the vaccine will not be as smooth as everyone would ideally want. There is a global demand for these vaccines and there are bound to be times when supply does not meet demand. So the logic of the move is that by spreading this thin resource the most widely, it will have the greatest benefit - not only to the vulnerable but to everyone. Lives have been put on hold and livelihoods lost. This is the quickest way back to some degree of normality. Even if it does leave some of the vaccinated susceptible to infection, it should in theory at least protect them from serious illness. Given where we are now, the argument is that that is a price worth paying. As well as approving the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine on Wednesday - the second approved for use in the UK - regulators also said that doctors could wait longer between the two courses. This means more people will get the first jab sooner, even if they have to wait longer for their second jab. Experts advising the government, including the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), said the focus should be on giving at-risk people the first dose of whichever vaccine they receive. Defending the move, the UK's four chief medical officers - including England's Prof Chris Whitty - said in a statement released on New Year's Eve: ""In terms of protecting priority groups, a model where we can vaccinate twice the number of people in the next two to three months is obviously much more preferable."" They said they recognised that rescheduling second appointments was ""operationally very difficult"" and would ""distress patients who were looking forward to being fully immunised"". However, they said that for every 1,000 patients booked in for a second dose, which will ""gain marginally on protection from severe disease"", that would mean 1,000 more people missing out on ""substantial initial protection"". The chief medics said that, while one million people had already been vaccinated, approximately 30 million UK patients and health and social care workers eligible in the first phase ""remain totally unprotected and many are distressed or anxious about the wait for their turn"". They added that the JCVI was ""confident"" 12 weeks was a reasonable interval between doses ""to achieve good longer-term protection"". ""We have to follow public health principles and act at speed if we are to beat this pandemic which is running rampant in our communities, and we believe the public will understand and thank us for this decisive action."" Earlier, the BMA's Dr Richard Vautrey said GPs were unhappy they were being asked to cancel appointments that had already been made for second doses. He said the BMA would support practices who honour the existing appointments for the follow-up vaccination, calling for the government to do the same.

"A new era has begun for the United Kingdom after it completed its formal separation from the European Union. The UK stopped following EU rules at 23:00 GMT, as replacement arrangements for travel, trade, immigration and security co-operation came into force. Boris Johnson said the UK had ""freedom in our hands"" and the ability to do things ""differently and better"" now the long Brexit process was over. But opponents of leaving the EU maintain the country will be worse off. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, whose ambition it is to take an independent Scotland back into the EU,tweeted,external: ""Scotland will be back soon, Europe. Keep the light on."" BBC Europe editor Katya Adler said there was a sense of relief in Brussels that the Brexit process was over, ""but there is regret still at Brexit itself"". The first lorries arriving at the borders entered the UK and EU without delay. On Friday evening, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps tweeted thatborder traffic had been ""low due to [the] bank holiday"",externalbut there had been no disruption in Kent as ""hundreds"" of lorries crossed the Channel with a ""small"" number turned back. Six freight loads travelling from Holyhead in Wales to Ireland had to be turned away due to not having the correct paperwork, the Stena Line ferry and port group said on Friday morning. But later on Friday, the group said freight traffic was flowing well through its ports and government customs systems were working well. It added that the fall in freight traffic after the Christmas and Brexit stockpiling period meant ""it is too early to draw any conclusions"", but the company remained ""cautiously optimistic that, as freight volumes begin to rise again, we will be able to ensure the continued free movement of goods"". What happens now that a deal's been done? A quick guide to what's in the Brexit deal Brexit: Seven things that will change UK ministers have warned there will be some disruption in the coming days and weeks, as new rules bed in and British firms come to terms with the changes. But officials have insisted new border systems are ""ready to go"". As the first customs checks were completed after midnight, Eurotunnel spokesman John Keefe said: ""It all went fine, everything's running just as it was before 11pm."" Northern Ireland has different arrangements from other parts of the UK, meaning there will besome customs checks on goods moving between Great Britain and the province. On Friday afternoon, the first ferry from Great Britain operating under the terms of Northern Ireland trading protocol docked in Belfast, on schedule at 13:45 GMT. Seamus Leheny, policy manager at Logistics UK, said six out of the 15 lorries that were on the first ship to arrive into Belfast were brought in for inspection, with one being kept at the port for more than three hours. ""Inevitably there are going to be teething problems because with such a new, complex system as this there are going to be issues in the first few days,"" he told BBC Radio 4's PM programme. The first lorry loads on to the Eurotunnel shuttle after the UK left the single market and customs union Mandy Ridyard, whose aerospace components company makes daily shipments to Northern Ireland, told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme she was ""filling in the same declaration to send goods to the Philippines that I am sending them within the UK"". ""And obviously that all adds a lot of cost to my business."" The UK officially left the 27-member political and economic bloc on 31 January, three and half years after the UK public voted to leave in the 2016 Brexit referendum. But it stuck to the EU's trading rules for 11 months while the two sides negotiated their future economic partnership. A treaty was finally agreed on Christmas Eve, and became law in the UK on Wednesday. Under the new arrangements, UK manufacturers will have tariff-free access to the EU's internal market, meaning there will be no import taxes on goods crossing between Britain and the continent. But it does mean more paperwork for businesses and people travelling to EU countries, while there is still uncertainty about what will happen to banking and services. The UK and Spain have also reachedan agreement meaning the border between Gibraltar and Spain will remain open. Fabian Picardo, Gibraltar's chief minister, said the deal still needed to be formalised, but by abolishing controls between Gibraltar and the EU's passport-free Schengen area, he said it would prevent queues at the border ""which make people's lives a misery and make business difficult"". It is a moment that some will regard with huge optimism, others with deep regret. And while this historic move happens at a moment in time, the impact, in some areas, may be less instant or obvious than others - for example, it's expected there'll be relatively little traffic at Dover on the first day of 2021 as new border checks kick in. Nevertheless, significant changes are here - whether on trade, travel, security or immigration - and those changes could well become more apparent in the months ahead. Mr Johnson - who took the UK out of the EU in January six months after becoming prime minister - said it was an ""amazing moment"" for the UK in his New Year message. This video can not be played Laura Kuenssberg challenges Boris Johnson on Brexit and vaccines Writing in the Daily Telegraph,,externalhe added that the combination of the Brexit deal and rollout of the Oxford vaccine means ""we are creating the potential trampoline for the national bounceback"". Lord Frost, the UK's chief negotiator, tweeted that Britain had become a ""fully independent country again"". And the deputy chairman of the pro-Brexit European Research Group of Tory backbench MPs, David Jones, told the BBC: ""We can now say clearly Britain is a sovereign and independent state.""

But opponents of Brexit say the country will be worse off than it was while it was a member of the EU. Ireland's Foreign MinisterSimon Coveney said,externalit was ""not something to celebrate"" and the UK's relationship with Ireland will be different from now on, but ""we wish them well"". French President Emmanuel Macron said the UK remained a ""friend and ally"", but he added that the choice to leave the EU was ""the child of European malaise and many lies and false promises"". In Brussels, there is a sense of relief the Brexit process is over, but there is regret still at Brexit itself. Basically, the European Union thinks that Brexit makes it - the EU - and the UK weaker. But the EU view is this is less bye-bye Britain and more au revoir, because there are so many loose ends between the two sides. For example, there are the ongoing practicalities surrounding Gibraltar, the UK is still waiting to find out what access Brussels is going to give its financial services to the single market, there is cooperation on climate change, and there is a reviewal mechanism written into the treaty for every five years. For all of those reasons and more, this is not the end of the EU-UK conversation for the foreseeable future. The culmination of the Brexit process means major changes in different areas. These include: The free movement of people between the UK and EU countries has ended - and has been replaced in the UK by a""points-based"" immigration system,external Anyone from the UK who wants to stay in most of the EU for more than 90 days in any 180-day period now needs a visa Duty-free shopping has returned,,externalwith people coming back to the UK from the EU able to bring up to 42 litres of beer, 18 litres of wine, four litres of spirits and 200 cigarettes without paying tax EU citizens wanting to move to the UK (except those from Ireland) face the same points-based system as people elsewhere in the world UK police havelost instant access to EU-wide databaseson criminal records, fingerprints and wanted persons.

"For months, the government has been urging businesses to get ready for a new era in trading with the EU. But it was only on Boxing Day that details of all the new rules were actually published. Business groups are relieved that the threat of a no-deal Brexit, which would have meant tariffs (or taxes) on goods crossing the border with the EU, has been removed. But companies that trade with the EU are still facing a lot of new bureaucracy. And the disruption in mid-December, caused by border closures related to the new variant of Covid-19, was a reminder of how dependent the UK economy is on trade across the English Channel. From 1 January 2021, goods entering the EU from Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) face large amounts of new paperwork and checks, including: customs declarations rules of origin checks product safety certificates food inspections This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Hauliers will also need to make sure they have the right transportation paperwork before they drive to the border. There is particular focus on the ""short straits"" route between Dover and Calais, and the nearby Channel Tunnel, which taken together handle about four million lorries a year. ""This is the biggest imposition of red tape that businesses have had to deal with in 50 years,"" says William Bain from the British Retail Consortium. Full controls on British exports to the EU began on 1 January. Thefirst day of the new regimeappears to have gone relatively smoothly. But it's feared that later in the year, the new controls could cause disruption, even though new border infrastructure has been built at ports such as Calais, to help process vehicles more efficiently. There are some mitigating measures though. In response to the Covid crisis, the government is delaying full controls on goods entering Great Britain from the EU for a further six months. There will be checks from 1 January on controlled substances such as alcohol and tobacco, and traders deemed to be a risk will also be asked to fill in customs declarations. But most checks on goods coming in from the EU will be delayed until 1 July, a deadline that could in theory be extended. ""I think we will want to monitor it,"" the chief executive of HM Revenue and Customs, Jim Harra, told MPs in November. ""Hopefully we will not still be in a situation where Covid-19 is consuming as much of people's attention."" Other measures to tackle potential disruption include diverting trade to other ports around the country and opening lorry parks in Kent, to avoid gridlock on the roads. Some of these contingencies were put into action early, to deal with the Covid border closures in December. Operation Brock, for example, involved changing the layout of a section of the M20, using a concrete barrier to allow lorries heading for mainland Europe to queue safely on the motorway. Thousands of lorries were also diverted to temporary parking at a disused airport at Manston. From 1 January drivers of lorries weighing more than 7.5 tonnes will need to acquire a Kent Access Permit before they enter the county. They will have to show that they have all the paperwork they need to ferry goods to Europe. But that doesn't deal with the challenge of the thousands of vans that cross the Channel every week. ""What has been serially misunderstood by various parts of government is the scale of the complexity for people on the ground dealing with the paperwork,"" says Duncan Buchanan, the Policy Director of the Road Haulage Association. That could mean that instead of queues on motorways, many traders won't be able to leave their depots. ""Either they won't be able to get vets to sign off on their meat exports, or they won't be able to get their permit because they don't have the right bits of paper,"" says Shane Brennan, chief executive of the Cold Storage Federation. ""We might see a quite significant holding off of trading - people just not moving stuff in the first few weeks."" Eighty-five per cent of the volume of trade between the EU and Great Britain is carried by EU hauliers, who are often paid not by the hour, but by the kilometre. If they think there will be too many delays, many may simply not come. The government says the readiness of traders to deal with the new system remains its biggest concern. Lorries parked on the M20 in Kent ""The sheer scale of the overall operation means there are literally many millions of moving parts,"" permanent secretary of the cabinet office Alex Chisholm told MPs. ""Inevitably there are going to be some difficulties for some individual people as they adjust to the new regime."" The government has also announced a new Border Operations Centre as part of plans ""for the UK to have the world's most effective border by 2025"". Questions have been asked about how changes at the border might affect food supply. The short answer is no-one can say for sure, but nearly 30% of all the food consumed in the UK is imported from the EU. The good news is that there is a deal, which makes a big difference. But the challenge is particularly acute because the UK grows relatively small amounts of fruit and vegetables in January and February and is most dependent on supplies from southern Europe at this time of year. So, if there are delays, they could cause some shortages on the shelves. ""Some gaps are possible but we're not going to run out of food - that's not going to happen"" says Ian Wright. When it comes to non-perishable items, there had been some stockpiling in preparation for either outcome, but extra supplies won't last forever. ""The crunch point is probably not going to be in the first few days or weeks of January,"" William Bain argues. ""Towards the end of the month, when new orders start being placed and delivered, we will start to see the processes in Kent and the other ports really tested."" And it's not only about food. Other retailers, which are used to moving their stock freely around the EU customs union, have had to create separate supply chains for the UK. That is costing them more money, and their new systems have yet to be tested properly. It's not just about trade across the English Channel. Trade across the Irish Sea between Great Britain and the Republic of Ireland will be subject to the same pressures, while Northern Ireland will be a special case under the terms of the Northern Ireland protocol in the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement. Northern Ireland will remain in the EU single market for goods, and unlike the rest of the UK it will continue to enjoy frictionless trade with the EU with no checks of any kind at the land border with the Republic. But there is a price to pay for that - new bureaucracy within the UK between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The EU, for example, has strict rules on products of animal origin: meat, milk, fish and eggs. These products must enter the single market (and, from 1 January, Northern Ireland) through a border control post where paperwork is checked, and a proportion of goods physically inspected. There will be a grace period of three months for supermarkets and their suppliers, but some smaller traders may have to get used to thenew rules,externalstraight away. All shipments from Great Britain to Northern Ireland will also need a safety and security declaration, and a customs declaration from a new IT system which none of the traders have used before. The government has set up a Trader Support Service to help. The details of the new trading arrangements for Northern Ireland were announced separately in early December, and provided some clarity. They include an agreement which means the vast majority of goods being shipped from GB to NI will not be at risk of having tariffs imposed. But there are plenty of unresolved issues. Traders are seeking answers about how to send parcels from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, and someonline retailers have already suspended deliveries. The trade from British to Northern Irish ports often involves multiple small shipments on a single lorry - all of which will need the right paperwork. ""We need clear rules for everyone in the supply chain,"" says Duncan Buchanan, ""and when you scratch the surface it is just not ready."" It is expected that many checks will be carried out on a 'light touch' basis to begin with. But anyone trading between Great Britain and Northern Ireland is going to have to get used to a new way of working very quickly. What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

"The UK-EU trade agreement, which contains new rules for living, working and trading together, takes effect from 23:00 GMT on 31 December. The full complicated agreement ismore than 1,200 pages long,,externalbut here are some of the key points. What the deal says There will be no taxes on goods (tariffs) or limits on the amount that can be traded (quotas) between the UK and the EU from 1 January Some new checks will be introduced at borders, such as safety checks and customs declarations. There are some newrestrictions on certain UK animal food products,external. For example, uncooked meats like sausages and burgers can't enter the EU unless they are frozen to -18C. What does that mean? Having a deal in place means that the fear that some goods could become more expensive has been avoided. However, businesses will still need to prepare for new procedures at ports, and if new paperwork is incomplete,it could lead to disruption. What the deal says: Businesses offering services, such as banking, architecture and accounting, will lose their automatic right of access to EU markets and will face some restrictions. There will no longer be automatic recognition of professional qualifications for people such as doctors, chefs and architects. What does that mean? Rather than following one set of rules for the whole of the EU, UK businesses will need to comply with the regulations in each individual country. It will be harder for people with qualifications gained in the UK to sell their services in the EU. Individuals will need to check each country's rules to make sure their qualification is still recognised. However, the UK and EU have pledged to keep talking to try to improve access for the service sector in the future. What the deal says: UK nationals will need a visa for stays of longer than90 days in the EU in a 180-day period. EUpet passportswill no longer be valid. European Health Insurance Cards, (EHIC) cardswill remain valid until they expire. The UK is no longer subject to the ban on additional roaming charges, although both sides will encourage operators to have""transparent and reasonable rates"" for roaming. What does that mean? The UK government says EHIC will be replaced with a newUK Global Health Insurance Card,external, but full details have not been released yet. Pets will still be allowed in the EU, but it will be a more complicated process as owners will need to obtain an animal health certificate for each trip they make. UK mobile operators will be able to charge for roaming, so people should check with their mobile phone company before travelling. What the deal says: Over the next five-and-a-half years,the UK will gradually gain a greater share of the fish from its own waters. The UK could choose to ban EU fishing boats from 2026, but the EU would be allowed to introduce taxes on British fish in response. What does that mean? Fishing was the hardest and last issue to be resolved in the negotiation, and some UK fishermen are unhappy with the arrangement. The Scottish Fishermen's Federation, for example, says the deal does not give the UK enough control of its waters. Starting in 2026, the UK and the EU will hold regular talks on fishing access. So there could be more heated arguments ahead. What the deal says: There will be no role in the UK for the European Court of Justice (ECJ), which is the highest court in the EU. Disputes that cannot be resolved between the UK and the EU will be referred to an independent tribunal instead. What does that mean? Ending the role of the ECJ was a key UK demand as Brexit supporters said it would allow the UK to ""take back control"" of its laws. The ECJ could still have a role in Northern Ireland because it continues to follow some EU trade rules. If either side moves too far away from the current rules around product standards, tariffs (charges on imports) could be imposed on some goods in the future. What the deal says: The UK will no longer have automatic access to key security databases, but should be able to gain access upon request. The UK will not be a member of the EU's law enforcement agency, Europol, but it will have a presence at its headquarters. The UK is no longer obliged to comply with EU standards of data protection, but data will continue to be exchanged in the same way for at least four months as long as the UK doesn't change its data protection rules. What does that mean? The UK's arrangement with Europol will be similar to the one the US currently has. Many of the rules about storing and processing data still need be decided. What the deal says: The UK will no longer participatein the Erasmus exchange programme, an EU scheme that helps students study in other countries. Students at universities in Northern Ireland will continue to participate in Erasmus, as part of an arrangement with the Irish government. What does that mean? Students that have already started courses in the EU will continue to receive support for fees. A new scheme named after the mathematician Alan Turing,externalwill begin in September 2021. The government says it will be similar to Erasmus but will include countries across the world.

"All remaining Covid restrictions have now been scrapped in English schools. Rules have also been eased elsewhere in the UK, but some measures are being retained for the moment. Staff and students without symptomsinEnglandareno longer asked to test for Covid twice-weekly. Secondary school pupils alsodon't need to wear masks. Thelegal requirement to self-isolate after a positive test is also being removed, although it is still recommended. Head teachers groups havewarned that the changes to testing and self-isolation ""may actually lead to an increase in disruption"", as Covid is more likely to spread in the classroom, leading to further pupil and staff absence. All school staff and secondary school pupils inScotlandandNorthern Irelandare still asked to take two lateral flow tests (LFTs) a week(three inWales). InWales,schools are largely back to normal,external. Face coverings will no longer be required in classrooms after 28 February, but should still be worn in communal areas of secondary schools. InNorthern Ireland, schoolsreopened with the same measures as last term. If a primary or post-primary class has multiple Covid cases,all pupils should take an LFT. The guidance that pupils in post-primary schools should wear face coverings still applies. InScotland,social distancing remains in place. However, pupils will no longer have to wear masks in schoolfrom 28 February. Thelatest data,externalfor England shows that 182,000 pupils (2.2%) of pupils were absent for Covid-related reasons on 10 February, down from 320,000 (3.9%) on 3 February. On the same date, 2.8% of teachers and school leaders and 2.5% of teaching assistants and other staff were absent due to Covid, down from 4.4% and 4.1% respectively the previous week. Almost half England's schools (45%) had one in 20 teachers absent due to Covid. InScotlandon 17 February,12,638 students (2.4%) were missing from school,externaldue to Covid-related reasons. The highest absence rate this year was seen on 7 January, when 43,565 students (14.1%) were off. InNorthern Ireland,5.2% of students, 9% of teachers and 11% of classroom assistants in schools were absent due to Covidover the week 24 to 28 January - the highest rates since the new term began. Many schools have told the BBC they have struggled to find temporary staff to cover the teachers who are off. England's Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawiurged retired teachers to return and join teacher supply agencies to fill gaps, but a BBC survey suggested there had been a limited response. Mr Zahawi also suggested schools could merge classes. But teaching unions said there were logistical difficulties and safety issues with teaching large groups of children. After Thursday 24 February,people in England with Covid will no longer have a legal obligation to self-isolate. However, people who test positive will still be advised to stay at home and avoid contact with others for at least five full days, including school staff and students. The legal requirement to self-isolate remains in place across Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. As long as they don't haveCovid symptoms, under-18s already don't have to self-isolate if someone else in their household has Covid. Similarly, whole classes are no longer automatically sent home to isolate if a pupil or teacher tests positive. However, close contacts aged five or above are strongly advisedto testfor at least seven days. All primary and post-primary pupils in Northern Ireland are advised to take an LFT if there are multiple Covid cases in their class. Allchildren aged five to 11 in the UKwill be offered a low-dose vaccine, which is being rolled out on a ""non-urgent"" basis. It's expected to be offered in England in April, and plans are also under way in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. In addition: the low-dose vaccineis already being offered to five to 11-year-olds with medical conditionsthat put them at greater risk all children aged 12 and overare being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab sixteen and 17-year-olds who had a second vaccine dose at least three months ago can have a booster theJCVI has also recommended,externalthat the booster is also offered to children aged 12-15 who are in an at-risk group or live with someone who is immunosuppressed Children who aren't at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after a positive test before having a jab. Grades will again be decided by external marking, instead of the teacher assessments used in 2020 and 2021, but grade boundaries will be more lenient in England, Wales and Scotland. English exam boardshave published details about this year's GCSE, AS and A-level papersfor most subjects, including maths, biology, chemistry and languages. Students taking GCSE exams in English Literature, geography, history and ancient history won't have to answer questions on one option from their course. In maths and science exams, students will be given sheets of formulae and equations. Students takingvocational B-Tec qualificationswill have fewer internal assessments. Qualification Wales, the Scottish Qualification Authority (SQA) and Northern Ireland's CCEA exam board have already set out their plans to ensure candidates' work is fairly assessed.

"Rules on travelling between the UK and European Union countries change on 1 January 2021, after an agreement to keep many rules the same for 11 months after Brexit comes to an end. At the moment, no. Because of Covid, travellers from most non-EU countries can't visit except for essential reasons. After 31 December, the UK will no longer be treated like a member of the EU, so becomes subject to these rules. The only non-EU countries exempt from these restrictions are those with very low infection rates, such as New Zealand. The EU could choose to exempt the UK, and individual EU countries could create a ""travel corridor"" with the UK, allowing restriction-free travel. If the rules are changed, you'll be able to travel to all EU countries - plus Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein - as a tourist, without needing a visa. 10 things to look for in the Brexit deal You'll be able to stay for up to 90 days in any 180-day period. So, an Easter weekend in Spain, followed by a June fortnight in Italy, would be covered by your 90-day limit. The rules for Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania are different. You could make a 90-day trip to any of them and still not use up your 90-day allowance for other EU countries. You may need a visa or permit to stay for longer, to work or study, or forbusiness travel.,external From 2022, UK nationals will have to pay for avisa-waiver scheme,externalin order to visit many European countries. No. Your current passport will be valid as long as: It is less than 10 years old And has six months left before it runs out The six-month rule won't apply for visits to Ireland, because it is part ofthe Common Travel Area.,external If you need a new passport -which will be a different colour- the government says youshould apply in plenty of time.,external The European Health Insurance Card (EHIC)has entitled about 27 million UK citizens to state-provided medical treatment if they fall ill or have an accident in EU countries, as well as a number of others. All EHIC cards issued before the end of 2020 will be valid until their expiry date (on the front of your card). The government says it will issue a new card, called the UK Global Health Insurance Card (GHIC). Like EHIC, it will cover chronic or existing illnesses, routine maternity care and emergencies. However, there are no further details yet on when it will start. Its advice,externalis that you should buy travel insurance with healthcare cover before going on holiday - especially if you have a pre-existing medical condition. You'll no longer be able to use EU fast-track passport control and customs lanes. When you arrive in an EU country (except Ireland), be prepared to show your return ticket. You could also be asked to show that you have enough money for your stay. It could also takelonger to cross the UK border.,external The guarantee of free roaming throughout the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norwayends on 1 January 2021. You should check with your mobile provider to see if you're likely to face extra charges. The four main UK operators have said they have no plans to reintroduce roaming fees. The EU and the UK agreed to co-operate on international mobile roaming. But there is nothing in the post-Brexit trade agreement that would stop travellers being charged for using their phone in the EU, and vice versa, in the future. The government has passed laws to protect customers, including: A Â£45-a-month cap on using mobile data abroad (then you must opt in to use more) Requirements for customers to be informed when they've reached 80% and 100% of their data allowance Yes, but you'll need to take your driving licence, as well as your log book (V5C) and valid insurance documents if you are taking your own car. You will need to contact your insurer six weeks before you travel to get a green card that will prove you have insurance. Most drivers will not need to buy an International Driving Permit, with the exception of those with paper licences (not photocards) and those with licences issued in Gibraltar, Guernsey, Jersey or the Isle of Man, who will need one for some European countries. What are the rules on driving in the EU after transition? Pet passports issued in Great Britain will not be valid for travel to the EU from 1 January 2021. From that date,pets travelling from Great Britain to the EU will need to have an animal health certificate (AHC).,externalThe same rules will apply if you are taking your pet to Northern Ireland. In 2002, this dog was the first to travel to the UK using a pet passport AHCs will be issued by a vet, will be valid for four months and must be obtained no more than 10 days before travel. AHCs will be valid for a single trip into the EU, onward travel within the EU and re-entry to Great Britain. Your pet must have been microchipped and have had a rabies vaccination. It will also have to have a treatment againstEchinococcus multilocularis(a type of tapeworm) for entry into Finland, Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland, Norway or Malta. Passengers from Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) travelling to EU countries cantake advantage of duty-free shopping,externalfrom January 2021. Limits on tobacco and alcohol will increase.

"The UK has reported another 55,892 daily cases of coronavirus, the highest figure on record. And another 964 people died within 28 days of a positive test, only slightly down on the 981 on Wednesday. It comes as Health Secretary Matt Hancock appealed to everyone to ""take personal responsibility this New Year's Eve and stay at home"". He said he knew how much had been sacrificed this year but, with the NHS under pressure, ""we cannot let up"". On Thursday, just after midnight, 20 million more people in England were placed under the toughest restrictions and told to stay at home. The new restrictions mean 44 million people, or 78% of the population of England, are now in tier four, where non-essential shops, gyms, cinemas and hairdressers have to stay shut. What can you still do in tier four? New coronavirus variant: What do we know? Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live Public Health England medical director Dr Yvonne Doyle said Christmas week had seen a worrying rise in cases - particularly among adults in their 20s and 30s. ""We have all had to make huge sacrifices this year, but please ensure that you keep your distance from others, wash your hands and wear a mask,"" she said. ""A night in at new year will mean you are significantly reducing your social contacts and can help stop the spread of the virus."" The 981 deaths recorded on Wednesday was the highest daily figure since April. Much of the rise in cases has been blamed on the spread of anew variant, which scientists believe is able to transmit more easily. It was initially concentrated in the London, the South East and eastern England, but Mr Hancock has said it is now responsible for the ""majority"" of new cases across the UK. With the number of Covid patients in hospitals increasing, some are being moved long distances for intensive care. Dr Michael Marsh, NHS England medical director for the south-west region, said patients had come from Kent to Plymouth and Bristol, where services were ""less stretched"". The latest NHS Test and Trace figures show 232,169 people tested positive for Covid in England at least once in the week to 23 December, up 33% on the previous week and the highest weekly rise on record. Covid case rates are continuing to rise in all regions of England - with London's rate at 735.5 per 100,000 people in the seven days to 27 December, up from 711.9 the previous week, the latest Public Health England report showed. Eastern England saw the second highest rate, 551.3 up from 510.8, followed by south-east England at 450.6, up from 427.4. Meanwhile, Scotland recorded 2,622 new Covid casesin the past 24 hours - a record high for the third day in a row. Public Health Wales reporteda further 1,831 cases in Wales,with the highest case rates in Bridgend (825.6 for every 100,000 people) and Merthyr Tydfil (754.2). And Northern Ireland has seen another 1,929 cases in the last 24 hours, ashospitals come close to capacity with latest figures showing only six empty beds. Some hospital trusts in the south of England have also been reporting that they are under extreme pressure because of increasing numbers of Covid patients. On Wednesday,EssexandBuckinghamshiredeclared major incidents, while an intensive care doctor at London's Whittington Hospital said they werefacing a ""tsunami"" of Covid cases. Prof Hugh Montgomery said people who did not follow social distancing rules or wear masks ""have blood on their hands"". The NHS said London's Nightingale Hospitalhad been ""reactivated"" and was ready to admit patients, in anticipation of rising pressures from the spread of the new variant.

"Freight lorries arrive at Dover hours before the new rules start Boris Johnson has said the UK has ""freedom in our hands"" and must make the most of it as the country prepares to leave EU trading rules at 23:00 GMT. Historic changes to rules on travel, trade, immigration and security are to come into force as the UK enters a new era of relations with the continent. UK officials have insisted new border systems are ""ready to go"" amid concerns about possible delays at ports. The PM said the UK could now do ""things differently and if necessary better"". The trade deal agreed by the two sides on Christmas Eve, and passed by MPs on Wednesday, avoids the need for import taxes - tariffs - after the UK leaves the EU's internal market and customs union on 1 January.

And the UK will gradually be able to keep more of the fish caught in its own waters, while the European Court of Justice will cease to have any role in deciding disputes between the UK and EU. If you are Boris Johnson this is huge, and exciting. If you are a business that's affected it might mean a big new opportunity, but it might also mean really big disruption and lots of extra hassle. The fact that there is a trade deal doesn't take all of the risk away. The treaty contains lots of uncertainty, not least for the biggest part of the economy: the service sector. Getting the agreement finalised in the time was a big achievement for both sides but there is a lot that it just doesn't cover that will, in time, have to be worked out somehow. Read Laura's blog Mr Johnson - who led the Leave campaign in the 2016 Brexit referendum and took the UK out of the EU in January six months after becoming prime minister, said the UK was on the verge of an ""amazing moment"". In his New Year message, the PM said he wanted the UK to be an ""open, generous and outward looking"" country that was a global leader in new technologies, fighting climate change and promoting free trade. ""We have our freedom in our hands and it is up to us to make the most of it."" And he urged the four nations of the United Kingdom to put the Brexit divisions of recent years behind them and focus on their common bonds. ""I think it will be the overwhelming instinct of the people of this country to come together as one United Kingdom - England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - working together to express our values around the world."" Intensive preparations have been taking place over the past two weeks to prepare the UK for the coming changes. The UK's Countdown Plan has involved operational testing of infrastructure at the border and close co-operation with France, Holland and Belgium. A government spokesman said: ""The border systems and infrastructure we need are in place, and we are ready for the UK's new start."" The UK Parliament was recalled to ratify the deal But concerns remain that many small businesses are not prepared for the changes and that with lorries without the correct paperwork set to be turned back at Dover and other ports, delays are inevitable. Traffic volumes are expected to be lower than normal on 1 January due to the pandemic but are expected to pick up from Monday, when the new procedures and the UK's contingency measures are expected to be tested. The government said450 ""Kent access"" permits had been issued to HGV lorries intendingto cross the channel at Dover on 1 January and hauliers arriving without them would be identified and subject to a Â£300 fine. One logistics firm told the BBC it would not send any trucks across until 10 Januarydue to congestion fears although Channel Tunnel Operator Getalink has said it expects the new systems to work smoothly. Brexit happened on 31 January 2020, but the UK has continued to follow Brussels' trade rules until now, while the deal was thrashed out. It completes the process set in motion in June 2016, when, in a referendum, UK voterschose by 52% to 48% to leave the EU. The free trade deal - agreed on Christmas Eve after nine months of negotiations - finallypassed into UK lawearly on Thursday morning - having also been backed by Brussels. This video can not be played Laura Kuenssberg challenges Boris Johnson on Brexit and vaccines But opponents say the country will still be worse off than it was while in the EU - and there is still uncertainty about what it will happen to banking and services, which are a major part of the UK economy. Meanwhile, the UK and Spain have reached agreementon a political framework for Gibraltar which will pave the way for a separate UK-EU treaty regarding the British overseas territory, which was not covered by the trade deal.

The UK Parliament was recalled to ratify the deal But concerns remain that many small businesses are not prepared for the changes and that with lorries without the correct paperwork set to be turned back at Dover and other ports, delays are inevitable. Traffic volumes are expected to be lower than normal on 1 January due to the pandemic but are expected to pick up from Monday, when the new procedures and the UK's contingency measures are expected to be tested. The government said450 ""Kent access"" permits had been issued to HGV lorries intendingto cross the channel at Dover on 1 January and hauliers arriving without them would be identified and subject to a Â£300 fine. One logistics firm told the BBC it would not send any trucks across until 10 Januarydue to congestion fears although Channel Tunnel Operator Getalink has said it expects the new systems to work smoothly. Brexit happened on 31 January 2020, but the UK has continued to follow Brussels' trade rules until now, while the deal was thrashed out. It completes the process set in motion in June 2016, when, in a referendum, UK voterschose by 52% to 48% to leave the EU. The free trade deal - agreed on Christmas Eve after nine months of negotiations - finallypassed into UK lawearly on Thursday morning - having also been backed by Brussels.

Meanwhile, the UK and Spain have reached agreementon a political framework for Gibraltar which will pave the way for a separate UK-EU treaty regarding the British overseas territory, which was not covered by the trade deal.

"London's Nightingale Hospital is ready to admit patients as hospitals in the capital struggle, the NHS has said. The Excel Centre site in east London has been ""reactivated"" amid a rise in the number of Covid-19 patients. Other Nightingale hospital sites across England are also being readied, with the UK recording arecord daily rise in coronavirus cases. An NHS spokesman said hospitals in London remain under ""significant pressure"". He said: ""In anticipation of pressures rising from the spread of the new variant infection, NHS London were asked to ensure the London Nightingale was reactivated and ready to admit patients as needed, and that process is under way."" Several NHS hospitals in London and the south-east are now reporting they are under extreme pressure as a result of a surge in the number of people falling seriously ill with Covid-19. An email to staff at the Royal London Hospital says they are operating in disaster medicine mode - warning they can no longer provide high-standard critical care. Will virus variant force the Nightingales to open? Health workers 'back in eye of storm' How the UK's newest hospital was built in nine days Nightingale hospitals in Manchester, Bristol and Harrogate are in use currently for non-Covid patients, the spokesman added. The Exeter site received its first Covid patients in November when it began accepting those transferred from the Royal Devon and Exeter NHS Foundation Trust, which was described as ""very busy"". He said: ""Covid inpatient numbers are rising sharply so the remaining Nightingales are being readied to admit patients once again should they be needed, in line with best clinical practice developed over the first and second waves of coronavirus."" Senior intensive care doctor Prof Hugh Montgomery warned those who fail to follow the rules on social distancing, hand washing and wearing a face covering""have blood on their hands"". NHS England medical director Stephen Powis has described the Nightingale hospitals as ""our insurance policy, there as our last resort"". London's Nightingale hospital was built in nine days, with the help of hundreds of soldiers He told a Downing Street press conference on Wednesday: ""We asked all the Nightingale hospitals a few weeks ago to be ready to take patients if that was required. ""Indeed, some of them are already doing that, in Manchester taking step-down patients, in Exeter managing Covid patients, and in other places managing diagnostics, for instance. ""Our first steps though, in managing the extra demands on the NHS, are to expand capacity within existing hospitals - that's the best way to use our staff.""

"Liverpool Mayor Joe Anderson is one of five men who have been rebailed by police Liverpool Mayor Joe Anderson says he will not fight for re-election in May due to an ongoing bribery and witness intimidation investigation. Mr Anderson, 62, made the announcement after Merseyside Policesaid he had been rebailed until Februaryfollowing his arrest earlier this month. He tweeted he was""disappointed"",externalwith the police decision as he had ""provided all of the information they asked for"". He said it was in the Labour Party's best interests to pick a new candidate. Mr Anderson was arrested on 4 December, along with four other men, on suspicion of conspiracy to commit bribery and witness intimidation. The year-long investigation, Operation Aloft, has focused on a number of building and development contracts in Liverpool. Following his arrest, Mr Anderson said he was ""stepping away from decision-making"" and wouldtake unpaid leavewhile the police investigation continued. The Labour Party also suspended Mr Anderson pending its outcome. Mr Anderson said he would ""continue to fight to demonstrate that I am innocent of any wrongdoing [and] also to protect my legacy as mayor of this city of which I am proud"". He said the timing of the police investigation meant ""it would be in the best interests of the Labour Party to select a new candidate for the mayoral election"". Mr Anderson also wrote: ""I have dedicated my life to this city with loyalty and passion and I am not prepared to throw that away."" Richard Kemp, leader of the Liberal Democrat opposition on Liverpool City Council, called on Mr Anderson to immediately resign from the local authority. Mr Kemp said his Labour opponent was a ""lame duck mayor"" who was ""preventing the city from moving on"". Mr Anderson said he hoped the police investigation would be completed ""long before"" the expiry of his term of office. He said it would confirm he had ""done nothing wrong"" and his name and reputation ""will be exonerated"". ""I have never done anything that would harm this city,"" he said. Earlier, Merseyside Police said five men had been rebailed until 19 February. The Labour Party has been contacted by the BBC for a comment. A councillor since 1998, Mr Anderson became Liverpool'sfirst directly elected mayor in 2012andearned a second term in 2016.

"Ontario Finance Minister Rod Phillips has resigned Ontario Premier Doug Ford has announced the resignation of his finance minister who took a trip to the Caribbean while the province remained under lockdown. Minister Rod Phillips apologised and called the travel a ""dumb mistake"". Mr Ford on Thursday said Mr Phillips' departure showed his government ""takes seriously our obligation to hold ourselves to a higher standard"". Canada's most populous province has discouraged all non-essential travel amid record-high new case counts. Mr Phillips, who is a member of the Progressive Conservative Party, had taken a personal trip to St Barts on 13 December and returned on Thursday morning. Ahead of the holiday season, Ontario health officials had urged residents to stay at home when possible amid an ongoing rise in Covid-19 cases. What's the situation in Ontario? Ontario entered a strict lockdown on 26 December On Thursday, the province reported a new record-high of 3,328 new Covid-19 cases and 56 new deaths, CBC reported Canada has over 582,000 total cases and 15,600 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University People line up on Christmas Day at a Covid test site in Ontario Mr Phillips told reporters when he arrived at Toronto Pearson Airport he hoped to keep his job, but would respect the premier's decision. ""Obviously, I made a significant error in judgment, and I will be accountable for that,"" Mr Phillips said. ""I do not make any excuses for the fact that I travelled when we shouldn't have travelled."" Later on Thursday, Mr Ford said in a statement he had accepted Mr Phillips' resignation following a conversation with him. Mr Ford has asked Peter Bethlenfalvy, currently president of the treasury board, to step into the finance minister role. On Wednesday, Mr Ford had said he learned of Mr Phillips travel two weeks ago, but said the minister ""never told anyone"" he was going to St Barts,according to CBC,external. Ontario's New Democratic Party leader Andrea Horwath on Wednesday had pushed for Mr Phillip's firing, saying it was unacceptable for him to ""ignore public health advice"" while the government ""demands sacrifice from everyday Ontarians"". ""It's not believable that a senior member of cabinet didn't tell the premier's office he was leaving the country for weeks during the height of a global emergency,"" she said in a statement. ""If he didn't, that in itself would be enough reason to demote him.""

"Father (left) and son have had divergent views on Brexit in the past The father of UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he is applying for French citizenship now that Britain has severed ties with the European Union. Stanley Johnson told France's RTL radio he had always seen himself as French as his mother was born in France. The 80-year-old former Conservative Member of the European Parliament voted Remain in the 2016 Brexit referendum. His son Boris spearheaded the Leave campaign and later took the UK out of the EU as prime minister. A quick guide to what's in the Brexit deal Brexit: Seven things that will change Stanley Johnson explained his reasons for seeking French citizenship in an interview broadcast on Thursday, hours before theUK was due to leave EU trading rules. ""It's not about becoming French,"" he told RTL. ""It's about reclaiming what I already have."" He pointed out that his mother was born in France to a French mother. ""I will always be European,"" he added. Stanley Johnson won a seat in the European Parliament when direct elections were first held in 1979, and later worked for the European Commission. As a result, Boris spent part of his childhood in Brussels. Brexit issues have divided the Johnson family. The prime minister's sister, the journalist Rachel Johnson, left the Conservative Party to join the Liberal Democrats ahead of the 2017 election in protest against Brexit. Their brother, the Conservative MP Jo Johnson, resigned from the cabinet in 2018 to highlight his support for closer links with the EU.

"Doctors are calling for a significant ramping up of the vaccination programme following approval of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. The first patients are expected to receive the jab - the second approved for use in the UK - on Monday. But with just over 500,000 doses available to use next week, experts are worried there may be a bottleneck in the system. There are more than 25m people in the nine priority groups identified so far. This includes all those over 50 and younger adults with health conditions, as well as frontline health and care staff. Oxford vaccine: How did they make it so fast? How do the vaccines compare? When will you be eligible for the Covid vaccine? Concern at 'unprecedented' English infection level Meanwhile, GPs have questioned the wisdom of cancelling patients already booked in for their second doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, the first jab that was approved and has been used since early December. As well as approving the Oxford vaccine on Wednesday, regulators also said that doctors could wait longer between the two courses needed, to ensure faster rollout of vaccination. But the British Medical Association's Dr Richard Vautrey said GPs were unhappy they were being asked to cancel appointments that had already been made for second doses. The original advice said they should be given three weeks apart. He said it was ""grossly unfair"" and would waste staff time. One of those who has been affected is Stella Joseph, who is 82 and has a chronic lung condition. ""The thing I feel most is utterly helpless, that there's nobody to appeal to, that you can't get any assistance with this at all. ""I think it is so hard that those of us who were in this first wave were obviously people who are at high risk and we're the ones who have been left high and dry."" The move has also prompted some debate about how strong the evidence is for delaying the second dose. Prof Peter Openshaw, of Imperial College London, said there was ""pretty convincing"" data showing it would enhance the effect of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. But he said because the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine had not been tested in the same way, there was no comparable evidence. So far nearly 950,000 people have received a first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. The hope was that when the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine was approved, it would lead to a significant increase in the rate of vaccination. The jab is easier to store and distribute as it can be kept at normal fridge temperature, unlike the Pfizer-BioNTech one that has to be kept in ultra-cold storage. There are thought to be more than five million doses of the Oxford vaccine in the UK, but only just over 500,000 are ready for use. That is because vaccines have to be put into vials and batched and certified. Sources at the NHS expressed frustration at the situation. ""The NHS is ready to go, but we can only go as quickly as supply allows,"" one said. Queen Mary University epidemiologist Deepti Gurdasani said there appeared to be a ""bottleneck"", and the government looked like it was still going to be under its target of two million doses a week. ""We really need to speed up rollout,"" she said. There are currently more than 700 vaccination sites up and running, with several hundred more thought to be ready to go once vaccines are available. But the limited supply of the Pfizer vaccine, which has to be shipped in from Belgium, has meant some centres have not been able to vaccinate people every week. Dame Clare Gerada, a former chair of the Royal College of GPs, said: ""We really now need a massive operational system. We need a 24/7 system with GPs, mass vaccination centres and hospitals - this needs to be scaled up. ""It's got to be football stadia, all these large venues that we've got currently lying dormant. ""If we can really get a mass operational system up and running, then I can't see why we can't be getting the whole population immunised by the spring."" NHS England's medical director for primary care, Dr Nikki Kanani, promised there would be a significant expansion of the vaccination programme in the coming weeks. She predicted the majority of care home residents would be protected by the end of January, and frontline staff would start to get a vaccination in large numbers. She also praised the progress made so far, thanking the ""tireless efforts of staff"". England Health Secretary Matt Hancock also praised staff, adding the numbers being vaccinated would ""rapidly increase in the months ahead"". Oxford vaccine: How did they make it so quickly?

"Gibraltar relies on thousands of Spanish workers commuting daily Spain has reached a deal with the UK to maintain free movement to and from Gibraltar once the UK formally leaves the EU on Friday. To avoid a hard border, Gibraltar will join the EU's Schengen zone and follow other EU rules, while remaining a British Overseas Territory. The deal was announced by Spanish Foreign Minister Arancha GonzÃ¡lez Laya, just hours before the UK exits the EU. The Rock voted Remain in 2016 and about 15,000 Spanish workers go there daily. ""With this [agreement], the fence is removed, Schengen is applied to Gibraltar... it allows for the lifting of controls between Gibraltar and Spain,"" said Ms GonzÃ¡lez Laya. The Gibraltar deal will mean the EU sending Frontex border guards to facilitate free movement to and from Gibraltar. Their role is planned to last four years. Gibraltarians are British citizens. They elect their own representatives to the territory's parliament, while the British monarch appoints a governor. The territory - home to a British military garrison and naval base - is self-governing in all areas except defence and foreign policy. UK 'ready for new start' as EU deadline approaches A quick guide to what's in the Brexit deal Ms GonzÃ¡lez Laya did not say whether Spanish border guards would eventually be posted at Gibraltar's airport and/or seaport which, under the deal, will be de facto part of the EU's external border. The Gibraltar deal would also mean the territory complying with EU fair competition rules in areas such as financial policy, the environment and the labour market, Ms GonzÃ¡lez Laya said. Twenty-two EU states are in the passport-free Schengen zone, as are Norway, Switzerland, Iceland and Liechtenstein, but the UK has never been in it. Once Gibraltar joins it, EU citizens arriving from Spain or another Schengen country will avoid passport checks, while arrivals from the UK will have to go through passport control, as is already the case. UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab called Thursday's deal a ""political framework"" to form the basis of a separate treaty with the EU regarding Gibraltar. This video can not be played Why Gibraltar is British - in 60 secs The deal does not address the thorny issue of sovereignty. Spain has long disputed British sovereignty over the Rock which was ceded to Britain in 1713 and which is now home to about 34,000 people. The Remain vote there was an overwhelming 96% in the 2016 EU referendum. The plan is to have a six-month transition period and then formalise the new arrangements with a treaty. Under the current tight Covid rules,there are restrictions on UK citizens arriving via Gibraltar's airport,external, the UK Foreign Office says. Dominic Raab said ""all sides are committed to mitigating the effects of the end of the [Brexit] Transition Period on Gibraltar, and in particular ensure border fluidity, which is clearly in the best interests of the people living on both sides. ""We remain steadfast in our support for Gibraltar, and its sovereignty is safeguarded.""

"Pension savers and investors' nest-eggs have been hit as the UK's leading share index had its worst year since the height of the financial crisis. The FTSE 100 index fell 14.3% over the year, marking its worst performance since 2008, when it slumped 31.3%. Despite the poor performance, the blue-chip index has recovered significantly since the start of the global pandemic when it was a third lower than now. Analysts have said that next year is likely to be better for investors. ""The factors which worked against the FTSE-100 in 2020 - the pandemic, a deep recession and Brexit - will start to fade into the background, giving corporate profits, dividends and employment a chance to bounce back,"" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. Such market volatility can be alarming, but people should not panic. Anyone who sold shares back in March would have missed out on the market's gains we've seen since, for instance. Market movements don't only affect savers with shares or funds that invest in the stock market. They also affect anyone with a pension scheme, as the money we stash for our retirement is invested on our behalf in the market. That means millions of workers in the UK are relaying on stock market returns for their financial future. Why have global stock markets gone up this year? Seasoned investors and fund managers are constantly taking action to protect their portfolio. That can mean moving cash out of risky markets or moving into safer cash havens, such as bonds. It's essential to diversify and not back just one investment opportunity, which is what funds are all about. By avoiding having all your savings in one basket - or share - then you avoid falling prey to the worst volatility of stock markets. ""The coronavirus market downturn spurred many young people to dip a toe into the world of investments for the first time - perhaps because they have been at home more,"" pointed out Myron Jobson, personal finance campaigner at Interactive Investor. ""The key for investors of all ages is to ensure that your portfolio is well diversified across assets, sectors and regions so that you are not overexposed to risk in any one part of the market."" ""If 2020 taught us anything it's that predicting short-term movements in the stock market is impossible,"" Robin Powell, editor of The Evidence-Based Investor told the BBC. ""Investors should check that they're happy with the level of risk they're taking, and if they are, they should ignore the noise and stay invested, rebalancing periodically."" He advises people to have a portfolio you can stick with through thick and thin, diversified across regions and sector, and that includes a percentage of government bonds to dampen the risk. ""And don't pay for help from anyone who thinks they know where markets are heading. They have no more of a clue than you do,"" he cautioned. Traders are affected by stock market falls, but so are you Mr Mould conceded that it has been hard to find a decent return in 2020 with interest rate cuts, falling returns from National Savings products and lower Government bond yields. But if you put your money overseas, the story could have been different. ""Japanese and US stock markets both had solid years and America's tech-laden Nasdaq soared by over 40%,"" he pointed out. That's a point taken up by Michael Baxter, economics commentator for The Share Centre. ""Compare the FTSE-100 with the US equivalent,"" he said. ""The S&P 500 surged this year hitting a new all-time high. By contrast, the FTSE 100 fell sharply."" He attributes that to the tech sector making up a high proportion of the US index. ""The COVID-19 crisis has accelerated a trend that was already in place before, namely the adoption of digital. ""By contrast, the FTSE 100 is made up too many companies with their base stuck in the past, trying to promote 20th century business models in the 21st century and Covid just served to make a bad situation worse.""

"Doctors are calling for a significant ramping up of the vaccination programme following approval of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. The first patients are expected to receive the jab - the second approved for use in the UK - on Monday. But with just over 500,000 doses available to use next week, experts are worried there may be a bottleneck in the system. There are more than 25m people in the nine priority groups identified so far. This includes all those over 50 and younger adults with health conditions, as well as frontline health and care staff. Oxford vaccine: How did they make it so fast? How do the vaccines compare? When will you be eligible for the Covid vaccine? Concern at 'unprecedented' English infection level Meanwhile, GPs have questioned the wisdom of cancelling patients already booked in for their second doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, the first jab that was approved and has been used since early December. As well as approving the Oxford vaccine on Wednesday, regulators also said that doctors could wait longer between the two courses needed, to ensure faster rollout of vaccination. But the British Medical Association's Dr Richard Vautrey said GPs were unhappy they were being asked to cancel appointments that had already been made for second doses. The original advice said they should be given three weeks apart. He said it was ""grossly unfair"" and would waste staff time. One of those who has been affected is Stella Joseph, who is 82 and has a chronic lung condition. ""The thing I feel most is utterly helpless, that there's nobody to appeal to, that you can't get any assistance with this at all. ""I think it is so hard that those of us who were in this first wave were obviously people who are at high risk and we're the ones who have been left high and dry."" The move has also prompted some debate about how strong the evidence is for delaying the second dose. Prof Peter Openshaw, of Imperial College London, said there was ""pretty convincing"" data showing it would enhance the effect of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. But he said because the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine had not been tested in the same way, there was no comparable evidence. So far nearly 950,000 people have received a first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. The hope was that when the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine was approved, it would lead to a significant increase in the rate of vaccination. The jab is easier to store and distribute as it can be kept at normal fridge temperature, unlike the Pfizer-BioNTech one that has to be kept in ultra-cold storage. There are thought to be more than five million doses of the Oxford vaccine in the UK, but only just over 500,000 are ready for use. That is because vaccines have to be put into vials and batched and certified. Sources at the NHS expressed frustration at the situation. ""The NHS is ready to go, but we can only go as quickly as supply allows,"" one said. Queen Mary University epidemiologist Deepti Gurdasani said there appeared to be a ""bottleneck"", and the government looked like it was still going to be under its target of two million doses a week. ""We really need to speed up rollout,"" she said. There are currently more than 700 vaccination sites up and running, with several hundred more thought to be ready to go once vaccines are available. But the limited supply of the Pfizer vaccine, which has to be shipped in from Belgium, has meant some centres have not been able to vaccinate people every week. Dame Clare Gerada, a former chair of the Royal College of GPs, said: ""We really now need a massive operational system. We need a 24/7 system with GPs, mass vaccination centres and hospitals - this needs to be scaled up. ""It's got to be football stadia, all these large venues that we've got currently lying dormant. ""If we can really get a mass operational system up and running, then I can't see why we can't be getting the whole population immunised by the spring."" NHS England's medical director for primary care, Dr Nikki Kanani, promised there would be a significant expansion of the vaccination programme in the coming weeks. She predicted the majority of care home residents would be protected by the end of January, and frontline staff would start to get a vaccination in large numbers. She also praised the progress made so far, thanking the ""tireless efforts of staff"". England Health Secretary Matt Hancock also praised staff, adding the numbers being vaccinated would ""rapidly increase in the months ahead"". Oxford vaccine: How did they make it so quickly?

"A 12-year-old girl is hoping to take legal action against video-sharing app TikTok, claiming the company uses children's data unlawfully. A court has ruled the girl can remain anonymous if the case goes ahead. The action is being supported by Anne Longfield, the children's commissioner for England. She believes TikTok has broken UK and EU data protection laws. TikTok said it had ""robust policies"" in place to protect children and did not allow under-13s to join. Ms Longfield hopes the case will lead to greater protective measures for under-16s who use TikTok in England and possibly beyond. She believes the app collects and processes children's data to power its video-recommendation algorithm, to capture viewers' attention and generate advertising revenue. The commissioner told the High Court in London - via a video link - that she hoped it to would ultimately issue an order forcing the firm to delete the child's data, setting a precedent. But the focus of the preliminary hearing was to decide whether the 12-year-old girl could make a claim anonymously. Mr Justice Warby judged that the girl risked being cyber-bullied by other children and TikTok users if her identity was revealed. He said she could face ""hostile reactions from social media influencers who might feel their status or earnings were under threat"". Ms Longfield is waiting for the conclusion of a data protection case against Google before deciding whether to sue TikTok. In 2019, TikTok wasfined $5.7m (Â£4.2m) by the US Federal Trade Commissionfor its handling of children's data. South Korea issued a fine for similar reasonsin 2020. In a statement, TikTok said: ""Privacy and safety are top priorities for TikTok and we have robust policies, processes and technologies in place to protect all users, and our younger users in particular. As this application was made without notice, we first became aware of the application and the High Court's judgment [on Wednesday] and are currently considering its implications."" The app's terms and conditions state the service is not available to under-13s and all users are asked their age when signing up. It actively reviews and removes accounts that appear to be used by under-13s.

"Secondary pupils will not return to school until 18 January in England ""Flexibility"" which could see secondary age children return to school over a week earlier than those in England and Scotlandremains Welsh Government policy, it has confirmed. According to councils, many secondary schools aim to return from 11 January, with some fully open on 6 January. The National Education Union Cymru called for face-to-face learning to be delayed until at least 18 January. It said more time was needed to understand thenew Covid-19 variant. Welsh schools have been asked to make provision for vulnerable children and children of key workers from next week. All pupils will be expected to take part in remote learning before their schools reopen for face-to-face teaching. Welsh councils say they are monitoring their local situation. Counties including Bridgend, Merthyr Tydfil, Rhondda Cynon Taf, Blaenau Gwent, Torfaen and Swansea are currently aiming to start the return of all pupils to school from Monday 11 January. In Monmouthshire all pupils are scheduled to return to school on Wednesday 6 January, with schools providing online learning on 4 and 5 January, unless they have inset days. In Conwy schools are also aiming to open to pupils from Wednesday 6 January ""subject to Welsh Government and Public Health Wales guidance and each individual school's assessment of their workforce"". Huw Hilditch-Roberts, Denbighshire council's lead member for education, said: ""Despite confirmed cases associated with Denbighshire schools being low, they are increasing and we have taken the difficult decision to follow Welsh Government guidance for schools to provide remote learning at the start of term, with the expectation that face-to-face learning will resume on Monday 11 January. ""We take any change to pupils' education very seriously and have not taken this decision lightly,"" he said. Powys council says pupils in years 7, 8 and 9 in the county will return from Wednesday 6 January, with older children starting face-to-face lessons again on 11 January. Secondary school pupils in England willnot return to face-to-face schooling until 18 January. In some of the highest infection areas in England, primary schools will also be closed until 18 January. In Scotland all primary and secondary schools are closed until 18 January at the earliest. In both nations, vulnerable children and children of key workers will return in the first week of term. The Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) Cymru's director Eithne Hughes said the overall situation was ""confusing"". She said: ""Some schools will have children in next week. Our view is that Welsh Government needs to make a central decision about schools reopening. After all they made a decision to put the country under the severest restrictions with no differentiation between councils on that."" ""Any decision needs to be based on the science... There needs to be transparency on the rationale. As soon as the science is available it should be released."" Children almost universally shrug off the virus, but the variant could alter the role they, and schools, play in spreading the virus. Mary van den Heuvel, senior policy officer at the National Education Union Cymru said: ""We know the Welsh Government took the sensible decision before Christmas to notify local authorities they had two weeks' flexibility at the start of term for returning to the classroom. ""But since then, we are in a Wales-wide alert level four situation. We need time for the scientists to find out more about this variant, and the transmissibility in school-aged children."" It was announced on Wednesday that primary schools in some areas of England will be closed until 18 January A Welsh Government spokesman said its priority was to enable pupils to receive face-to-face learning, where safe to do so. ""We have agreed with local authoritiesa common approach,externalto schools returning in January with some flexibility built in over the first two weeks of term. It is our expectation that pupils, when not in school, will continue to benefit from remote learning. ""As with any changes to schools and college openings for in-person teaching, decisions will be based on the latest scientific advice. We will continue to work in partnership with local authorities, schools and colleges on any changes to the scheduled opening arrangements. On Wednesday, Plaid Cymru education spokeswoman Sian Gwenllian questioned in the Senedd whether it was wise to have all pupils back in school even by 18 January, given the spread of the new variant of Covid-19. ""Aren't the signals currently suggesting that we should reconsider that policy and maintain on-site learning for smaller groups only beyond 18 January? ""If it's inevitable that schools will have to be closed for the majority of pupils, then, please, inform schools in good time. ""If closure is inevitable in order to prevent transmission, then we need to provide adequate warning so that teachers can prepare to teach as best as they can and for families to make their own arrangements too."" There are concerns closing schools isdetrimental to children, and in December Sally Holland, the children's commissioner for Wales, said she was not able to support further delays to in-school learning, except for individual schools in exceptional circumstances. ""Children and young people have told me that online learning, however well planned, is no substitute for being in the classroom. ""It clearly places already disadvantaged groups at a further disadvantage,"" she said. Staggered return for Wales' schools in January New coronavirus variant: What do we know?

"A rollout of the first approved vaccine - the Pfizer Covid-19 jab - is already under way Wales will get 22,000 doses next week of the second approved Covid vaccine, the Welsh Government has said. Dr Gillian Richardson, the doctor leading the rollout described getting theOxford-AstraZeneca vaccineto people across Wales as a ""huge task"". She originally said there would be 40,000 doses but the Welsh Government later    said it expected to reach that figure by the second week of January. Meanwhile Public Health Wales said 35,335 people had hadthe Pfizer jab. When asked how long the rollout of the latest vaccine would take, Dr Richardson toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfast: ""We can only give it at the rate at which it arrives, so some of that is not predictable with some of the international players in the vaccine manufacturing world but of course with Oxford we have a lot more control. ""So, by the time the Oxford-AstraZeneca is manufactured using a good steady flow, we'll be able to give you some of those predictions, but just now what we can say is we are doing those that are most vulnerable first, and we will get to everybody in their turn - please bear with us."" She also said it was ""excellent news"" the two doses could be administered up to 12 weeks apart, meaning more people could get their first jab sooner. She urged people to follow Wales' coronavirus restrictions as they celebrate new year: ""Please for everybody - take extra care. ""That'hands, face, space',externalmessage is really important, especially tonight, celebrate safely and enjoy yourself safely. ""It's going to be a while before we see vaccine turn the corner on those hospitalisations."" When will I get the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine? Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid vaccine clinics to be set up in Wales Covid vaccine: Older people's commissioner warns of 'confusion' Dr Helen Alefounder, a GP in Colwyn Bay, Conwy county, said she had not been told what date she would be administering the jab from, but planning was in full swing.

""Logistically it's a huge, huge ask. ""However, we do it every year for flu, so we really have a good background knowledge of everything that we need to do and everything we need to provide. ""It's just simple things like making sure that there's places for people to park and making sure that you can maintain social distancing and making sure that you can allow people time to sit afterwards after their vaccine in case of reactions."" Health boards across Wales are warning that despite the hope offered by the Covid vaccines, hospitals are under relentless pressure in this latest wave of infections. On Thursday, Cardiff and Vale University Health Board announced it would cease all non-urgent surgery and outpatient appointments in January. It follows similar decisions to halt non-urgent treatment at theSwansea BayandAneurin Bevanhealth boards earlier in December. ""This is to redeploy staff in support of urgent and emergency care, including critical care,"" said Steve Curry, the chief operating officer of Cardiff and Vale. The board said it had also opened a new ""surge facility"" at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff. ""The additional Lakeside Wing bed capacity will be used to support demand in the coming weeks,"" added Mr Curry. The medical director at neighbouring Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board said all its sites ""remain under significant pressure with unprecedented demand"". ""This is extremely challenging for out staff,"" said Nick Lyons. ""We currently have more than 600 suspected, confirmed or recovering Covid-19 patients in our hospitals and ITUs across our sites are over capacity. The situation is extremely serious."" Royal Glamorgan Hospital consultant Dr Dai Samuel says the NHS in Wales is ""teetering on the brink"" Dr Dai Samuel, a consultant hepatologist at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital in Llantrisant, Rhondda Cynon Taf, has been working on Covid wards during the pandemic. He said the rollout of a second vaccine was good news, but urged people to still follow restrictions: ""The position with the vaccine is very good but we are in an acute situation. ""It's very difficult across the NHS. We are teetering on the brink. A few days of bad luck can bring us to our knees. It's very challenging. ""I just say [to people], carry on listening to what you have been told for months."" More than 35,000 people have now received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in Wales, including people such as healthcare workers who work in Wales but live over the border in England. Almost 13,000 of these vaccines were given in the past week. Plaid Cymru has called on the Welsh Government to ask the UK government to publish evidence to justify increasing the period between the two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine from 21 days to 12 weeks. In a letter to the Health Minister Vaughan Gething, the party's health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said the ""sudden switch"" represented ""a very significant departure"" from previous guidelines. He added there were ""very real concerns"" that a longer delay between doses ""could significantly decrease the effectiveness of the vaccine"". The Welsh Conservatives criticised the speed of the rollout. Health spokesman Andrew RT Davies said: ""Three weeks ago, the first Covid-19 vaccine was given in Wales, and since that time we have sadly seen confusion and hope drop away. ""Many people over 80 in Wales were desperately waiting for their appointment to do their bit and have the vaccine but as we quickly learnt they would have to wait longer,"" he said.

"Boris Johnson has said the UK faces months of ""hard struggle"" as it tries to overcome the Covid pandemic. But, in his New Year message, the prime minister predicted that the release of vaccines would end the crisis and that the country would ""bounce back"". He said people would do ""normal things"" like hold hands and visit pubs again. Mr Johnson also promised the completion of the post-Brexit trade deal with the EU would leave the UK ""free"" to do more business with the rest of the world. Covid cases continue to surge across the UK, with another 55,892 daily cases of coronavirus reported on Thursday, up from 50,023 on Wednesday. It also recorded a further 964 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Three-quarters of England's population begin the new year in the highest level of restrictions, while Northern Ireland, Wales and all of mainland Scotland are in lockdown. UK's best years lie ahead, says Starmer Coronavirus restrictions around the UK UK 'ready for new start' as EU deadline approaches But the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine has been given the go-ahead for use next week, on top of the Pfizer-BioNTech injections which began in early December. In his message, Mr Johnson said that ""with every jab that goes into the arm of every elderly or vulnerable person, we are changing the odds in favour of humanity and against Covid"". He added: ""And we know that we have a hard struggle still ahead of us for weeks and months, because we face a new variant of the disease that requires a new vigilance. ""But as the sun rises tomorrow on 2021 we have the certainty of those vaccines."" The prime minister, who was himself hospitalised with Covid in April, said: ""I can imagine that there will be plenty of people who will be only too happy to say goodbye to the grimness of 2020."" But he argued that people had ""rediscovered a spirit of togetherness, of community"", in the struggle against the disease. ""I believe 2021 is, above all, the year when we will eventually do those everyday things that now seem lost in the past - bathed in a rosy glow of nostalgia, going to the pub, concerts, theatres, restaurants, or simply holding hands with our loved ones in the normal way,"" he said. ""We are still a way off from that. There are tough weeks and months ahead. ""But we can see that illuminated sign that marks the end of the journey, and even more important, we can see with growing clarity how we are going to get there."" The prime minister said the UK's bioscience and artificial intelligence industries, and its ""world-leading battery and wind technology"", would help the country ""bounce back"" in 2021 and ""in the years to come"". He looked forward to theCOP26 climate change summitin Glasgow in November as a chance to show the world ""an open, generous, outward-looking, internationalist and free-trading global Britain"". In his New Year message, released on Wednesday, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the UK's ""best years are still to come"".

"There have been almost 200,000 Covid-19 cases in Wales since the start of the pandemic The number of deaths from coronavirus reported to Public Health Wales (PHW) has gone past 5,000. A further 12 people have died in Wales with Covid, taking the total to 5,001. Health Minister Vaughan Gething has apologised for ""every single life that has been lost"" during the pandemic. ""Today we reached a sobering milestone,"" said Dr Giri Shankar, Covid incident director for PHW. ""That's one life lost every 90 minutes since March last year. 5,000 families grieving."" It comes on the same day as it is confirmed thatmore than 600,000 people in Wales- 19.2% of the Welsh population - have had their first dose of the coronavirus vaccine. Your tributes to those lost to Covid in Wales Booster jab 'may be needed to tackle variants' Widow's plea to BAME communities to have vaccine The PHW reports deaths that are confirmed cases in hospitals and some care homes. The number who have died with Covid when the virus is either suspected or confirmed by doctors, in all settings, is nearly 6,500. ""I'm deeply sorry for every single life that's been lost. Every family that's been affected,"" said Mr Gething. He said those that died were not ""just numbers"", adding: ""These are people who are loved and valued and leave others behind."" He said there was no ""good"" or ""bad"" figure for the numbers of deaths from the pandemic. He added: ""I'm afraid we can be terribly confident that without the measures that we've all taken together, more people would have come to harm, and more families would be grieving the loss of a loved one."" Dr Shankar urged everyone ""whatever their background, socio-demographic and ethnicity"" to have the vaccine when offered it. Vaughan Gething says it's difficult to talk about ""good"" and ""bad"" death figures in this pandemic. Many people might question the latter point. It's true that counting Covid deaths is not straightforward. Different organisations use different measures and therefore produce different figures. But of today's tragic milestone, more than two-thirds of the 5,001 deaths have occurred since September. International comparisons are difficult too, but nevertheless Wales - and the rest of the UK - has one of the highest excess death tolls in the world. There will be a large variety of possible explanations for this, from investment in health systems, to the rapidity of test and trace and the timings of lockdowns. But with elections across Britain scheduled for May, a dispassionate excavation of the data and the impact of decision making by governments will likely have to wait for the public inquiry. The worst day for Covid deaths in Wales during the whole pandemic was in January - theworst week was also last month- and the highest 13 days of coronavirus deaths reported by PHW have all occurred since mid-December. Hospital admissions involving coronavirus and Covid patients in critical care were at record levels in January - but now they are at their lowest since 28 December, at 2,261 inpatients. Wales' case rate of 116 cases per 100,000 people is the lowest in the UK and the lowest since 6 October. Mr Gething denied the Welsh Government had been naive about the risks at the start of the pandemic. This video can not be played Wales' health minister says those who have died with Covid are not ""just numbers"" He said there were ""different risks to the UK and to Wales at that point in time"". But he added ministers had ""never said"" that if coronavirus ""arrived at our shores in larger numbers then there wouldn't be harm caused - far from it"". Mr Gething said preparations had changed as more information came to light and that the ""reasonable worst case scenario"" in their plans talked about hundreds of thousands of deaths across the UK and ""nearly 26,000 deaths in Wales"". Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? When, where and how will I get my Covid vaccine? Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales Mr Gething said he had warned ministers at the time that ""individual burial may no longer be possible"" but said ""we haven't reached that scenario in reality"". But he said those plans ""show how much worse this could have been"". Welsh Conservative leader in the Senedd Andrew RT Davies called the 5,000 deaths a ""grim milestone"", adding: ""We must never forget the impact on them and their loved ones."" He said the ""consistency around the messaging"" was something that he regretted and it wasn't ""clear and loud enough right the way through the pandemic"", with some confused by ""unnecessary divergences"" between governments. This video can not be played Watch how the Covid-19 map of Wales has changed as case rates have eased since Christmas Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said the Welsh Government should have gone into lockdown ""harder and earlier"" in March 2020. However he praised the government and all those involved in the vaccination programme for the ""fantastic"" improvement in the vaccination rate. The health minister acknowledged, in hindsight earlier this month, thatmore lives could have been saved had Wales gone into lockdown earlierat the start of the coronavirus pandemic. Office for National Statistics (ONS) figuresinclude all deaths registered, when the virus is suspected or confirmed- and in all settings from hospitals to people's homes. Public Health Wales figures just show hospital and care home deaths with Covid, when cases have been confirmed by a lab test. Under the ONS figures,Wales passed 5,000 deaths a month ago. It is estimated that for 90% of these deaths in Wales, Covid is the underlying cause not just a contributory factor. This video can not be played The different measures for looking at deaths involving Covid-19 in Wales The ONS death toll - up to 22 January - was 6,473, with updated figures due out on Tuesday. Of the deaths reported to Public Health Wales on Monday, four more were in the Betsi Cadwaladr health board area in north Wales, three were in Hywel Dda in west Wales, two each were in Cwm Taf Morgannwg and Aneurin Bevan in south Wales while one death was in Swansea Bay. There were also 610 new Covid infections reported in the last 24 hour period, taking the total number of cases to 196,670. More than 600,000 people have now received their first dose of the coronavirus vaccine in Wales - with 603,976 people now having had the jab. Of those, 2,792 have had a second dose. Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales How many people have been vaccinated in Wales? How many coronavirus cases in the UK? The case rate in Wales has fallen to 116 per 100,000 people, the lowest it has been for four months. Flintshire has overtaken its neighbouring county Wrexham as the area with the highest case rate with 231.9 per 100,000 people. Wrexham's rate now stands at 229.5. The areas with the lowest case rate are Ceredigion with 56.4 per 100,000 people, followed by Pembrokeshire with 69.9 and Swansea with 70. Since the start of the pandemic 1,559,030  people have been tested for Covid-19 in Wales, with more than 2.5 million tests carried out. On Sunday 11,013 new tests were performed.

"This video can not be played Professor Hugh Montgomery says hospitals are facing a ""tsunami"" of Covid cases. People who do not follow social distancing rules or wear masks ""have blood on their hands"", an intensive care doctor has warned. Prof Hugh Montgomery told BBC Radio 5 Live hospitals were facing a ""tsunami"" of Covid cases and he feared it would get worse after New Year's Eve. He urged people to accept that it was going to be a ""miserable"" occasion this year and not to gather in groups. It echoes official advice to stay at home and not hold parties. About 44 million people in England are now living under the toughest level of Covid restrictions after tier four was expanded at midnight. Coronavirus: What are the rules for face masks or face coverings? Millions told to remain at home on New Year's Eve Which areas are going into tier four and what are the rules? Five ways to avoid catching coronavirus indoors Aged 22, 7 months pregnant and in Covid intensive care A further 50,023 new Covid cases were recorded in the UK on Wednesday, as well as 981 more deaths within 28 days of a positive test - more than double the previous day's total. Prof Montgomery, who works in intensive care at London's Whittington Hospital, and leads a research group at UCL, said: ""We are in a lot of trouble in UK intensive care now. ""Just huge numbers coming in, my heart goes out as well to our emergency departments, seeing a tsunami in the last week or two of cases. Everyone is working at maximum stretch."" He told Radio 5's Rachel Burden it was wrong to blame the surge in cases and deaths on the new variant of coronavirus, which was only ""slightly"" more transmissible and caused the same symptoms. ""It is making me actually very angry now that people are laying the blame on the virus, and it is not the virus, it is people, people are not washing their hands, they are not wearing their masks,"" he said. And he warned anyone not social distancing or following the rules that they ""have blood on their hands"". ""They are spreading this virus. Other people will spread it and people will die. They won't know they have killed people but they have."" He added: ""I am watching whole families getting wiped out here, and it's got to stop."" Prof Montgomery, who was on shift as he gave the interview to 5 Live, said it was ""a great myth"" that hospitals are being overwhelmed with elderly people. ""The people we are getting are, like the first wave, my age really. I am 58 and I would say half the patients are younger than me. It is middle-aged people or a little bit older that we are getting."" He also told how he had gone home for a shower after one of his shifts and been called back because a pregnant patient had deteriorated. And he issued a plea to people thinking of seeing in the New Year later with a party: ""I am really sorry this New Year is going to be miserable, but it has to be. Please don't gather in masses. Don't make this a last swansong."" Prof Montgomery's warnings echo advice from NHS England's Prof Stephen Powis, who told a Downing Street press conference on Wednesday: ""Covid loves a crowd, so please leave the parties for later in the year."" And in Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has already warned people not to celebrate Hogmanay in the traditional wayamid a lockdown across the mainland.

"All remaining Covid restrictions have now been scrapped in English schools. Rules have also been eased elsewhere in the UK, but some measures are being retained for the moment. Staff and students without symptomsinEnglandareno longer asked to test for Covid twice-weekly. Secondary school pupils alsodon't need to wear masks. Thelegal requirement to self-isolate after a positive test is also being removed, although it is still recommended. Head teachers groups havewarned that the changes to testing and self-isolation ""may actually lead to an increase in disruption"", as Covid is more likely to spread in the classroom, leading to further pupil and staff absence. All school staff and secondary school pupils inScotlandandNorthern Irelandare still asked to take two lateral flow tests (LFTs) a week(three inWales). InWales,schools are largely back to normal,external. Face coverings will no longer be required in classrooms after 28 February, but should still be worn in communal areas of secondary schools. InNorthern Ireland, schoolsreopened with the same measures as last term. If a primary or post-primary class has multiple Covid cases,all pupils should take an LFT. The guidance that pupils in post-primary schools should wear face coverings still applies. InScotland,social distancing remains in place. However, pupils will no longer have to wear masks in schoolfrom 28 February. Thelatest data,externalfor England shows that 182,000 pupils (2.2%) of pupils were absent for Covid-related reasons on 10 February, down from 320,000 (3.9%) on 3 February. On the same date, 2.8% of teachers and school leaders and 2.5% of teaching assistants and other staff were absent due to Covid, down from 4.4% and 4.1% respectively the previous week. Almost half England's schools (45%) had one in 20 teachers absent due to Covid. InScotlandon 17 February,12,638 students (2.4%) were missing from school,externaldue to Covid-related reasons. The highest absence rate this year was seen on 7 January, when 43,565 students (14.1%) were off. InNorthern Ireland,5.2% of students, 9% of teachers and 11% of classroom assistants in schools were absent due to Covidover the week 24 to 28 January - the highest rates since the new term began. Many schools have told the BBC they have struggled to find temporary staff to cover the teachers who are off. England's Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawiurged retired teachers to return and join teacher supply agencies to fill gaps, but a BBC survey suggested there had been a limited response. Mr Zahawi also suggested schools could merge classes. But teaching unions said there were logistical difficulties and safety issues with teaching large groups of children. After Thursday 24 February,people in England with Covid will no longer have a legal obligation to self-isolate. However, people who test positive will still be advised to stay at home and avoid contact with others for at least five full days, including school staff and students. The legal requirement to self-isolate remains in place across Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. As long as they don't haveCovid symptoms, under-18s already don't have to self-isolate if someone else in their household has Covid. Similarly, whole classes are no longer automatically sent home to isolate if a pupil or teacher tests positive. However, close contacts aged five or above are strongly advisedto testfor at least seven days. All primary and post-primary pupils in Northern Ireland are advised to take an LFT if there are multiple Covid cases in their class. Allchildren aged five to 11 in the UKwill be offered a low-dose vaccine, which is being rolled out on a ""non-urgent"" basis. It's expected to be offered in England in April, and plans are also under way in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. In addition: the low-dose vaccineis already being offered to five to 11-year-olds with medical conditionsthat put them at greater risk all children aged 12 and overare being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab sixteen and 17-year-olds who had a second vaccine dose at least three months ago can have a booster theJCVI has also recommended,externalthat the booster is also offered to children aged 12-15 who are in an at-risk group or live with someone who is immunosuppressed Children who aren't at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after a positive test before having a jab. Grades will again be decided by external marking, instead of the teacher assessments used in 2020 and 2021, but grade boundaries will be more lenient in England, Wales and Scotland. English exam boardshave published details about this year's GCSE, AS and A-level papersfor most subjects, including maths, biology, chemistry and languages. Students taking GCSE exams in English Literature, geography, history and ancient history won't have to answer questions on one option from their course. In maths and science exams, students will be given sheets of formulae and equations. Students takingvocational B-Tec qualificationswill have fewer internal assessments. Qualification Wales, the Scottish Qualification Authority (SQA) and Northern Ireland's CCEA exam board have already set out their plans to ensure candidates' work is fairly assessed.

"People spent less and saved more in 2020 as the pandemic led to shops, pubs and attractions being closed down. Consumer spending was down 7.1%, says Barclaycard, which tracks almost half of all credit and debit card spending. However spending on essential items climbed 4.1%, while independent businesses benefited as many more of us shopped locally. Meanwhile Brits working from home saved an average Â£110 a week, according to a separate survey from Aldermore Bank. ""2020 has accelerated many trends,"" said Raheel Ahmed, head of consumer products at Barclaycard. ""E-commerce has seen huge growth, working from home has meant many are shopping more locally and experiences within the home, such as virtual work-outs have become the norm."" The small shops in battle with the retail giants Hospitality worst-hit as unemployment rises again Online grocery shopping surged 70.3% over the year and looks set to have become the norm for many. The amount we spent on fuel fell by more than a fifth - 20.3% - as we made far fewer trips, and prices fell at the petrol pump. We also spent 15.6% less on clothing, presumably because many worked from home and there were no exciting events to go to that needed new outfits. Joh Rindom says there is a ""fashion for independents"" The Barclaycard data showed that we spent an extra 28.6% at independent food and drink shops, such as off-licences, butchers and bakeries, compared with a year earlier. It could be another trend that's here to stay as the card company's consumer confidence research showed that 57% of Brits wanted to increase their support of nearby businesses as a result of lockdown restrictions. Joh Rindom, who runs That Thing, an independent fashion, homeware and accessories shop, said perhaps because people have spent more time at home, perhaps because they've focused on what is important to them, this year there has been a ""fashion for independents"", she thinks. Support for florists bloomed during the year with purchases up 22.7% while spending on takeaways online surged 49.1%. But department stores were hard hit by the change in our spending habits, with spending down 17.2%, while clothing retailers experienced a 15.6% slump, leading to the financial problems at the likes of Debenhams and the Topshop owner, Arcadia. Brits' saving habits have been boosted by the change in lifestyle during the lockdown and pandemic changes. According to Aldermore Bank, weekly savings include Â£29 from not commuting, Â£20 on not spending as much on breakfasts and lunches, Â£22 on not socialising with work colleagues, Â£18 by avoiding takeaway coffees, and Â£22 on not going out on weekdays after work. ""The saving habits adopted due to the Covid-19 pandemic are likely to continue beyond this period and turn into better long-term spending routines,"" said Ewan Edwards, director of savings at Aldermore. ""One positive to take from 2020 is it has given some people the opportunity to reflect on how to improve their personal finances."" People who usually commute saved money Research by Moneysupermarket suggested that two-thirds of Brits saved an average of Â£586 per month in 2020 - equivalent to Â£7,032 over the course of the year. Londoners saved the most at Â£1,286 per month, followed by Yorkshire & the Humber who saved Â£690 and the East Midlands who saved Â£619. The Welsh saved the least at Â£302 per month. ""Some are saving more than ever as a result of no commuting fees, reduced childcare costs and far less going out for meals or day trips,"" said Sally Francis-Miles money spokesperson at MoneySuperMarket. ""This is especially evident in London where travel and childcare costs are often far higher."" But many have been hit hard and been unable to get into the savings habit in 2020. ""Money worries are a very real preoccupation for millions across the country,"" pointed out Ms Francis-Miles. ""Thousands have been made redundant or had their hours cut, they may be facing a struggle to cover the basics such as household bills and mortgage or rent payments.""

"Teachers and unions have criticised the government's last-minute move to delay the start of term for all secondary schools and some primaries in England. Vice president of the ASCL headteacher's union Pepe Di'Iasio said ministers should have decided earlier. ""We've all seen this coming, and we would have preferred to have been able to plan for this before the end of last term,"" he told BBC News. There is also concern over how areas have been chosen for primary closures. On Wednesday, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said some primary schools in Covid hot spots would remain closed - this equates to about 15% of primary schools. But there would be a review of these every two weeks, the Department for Education said, in the same way that local tier restrictions are reviewed. Meanwhile, Year 11 and Year 13 pupils are now due to return to face-to-face lessons on 11 January - a week later than planned - with others returning on 18 January. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, called on ministers to explain its decisions on which primary schools will re-open. He labelled the government's strategy as little more than ""keep calm and carry on"". ""There is obviously a huge amount of concern over how it can be safe for schools in some tier four areas to open,"" he said, ""while schools in other tier four areas are being told to move to remote learning. ""In some instances that means different approaches for schools only a few roads away from each other,"" he added. A Department for Education spokesman added some detail, saying: ""Decisions on which areas will be subject to the contingency framework are based on close work with PHE, the NHS, the Joint Biosecurity Centre, and across government to monitor the number of new infections, positivity rates, and pressures on the NHS. ""These measures will be reviewed every two weeks, and we hope they will be in place for the shortest period possible."" TESTING:How do I get a virus test? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters SCHOOLS:What will happen if children catch coronavirus? In December - on the last day of the Christmas term for many - the government asked schools to start setting up mass testing programmes for January. But heads and teachers said the timescale was not workable, as they would be setting up online learning for the majority of pupils in the first week of term as well. The delay to the start of term offers schools an extra week to get their mini test and trace systems up and running. There had been growing pressure for earlier school shutdowns as virus cases soared in many areas, including parts of London and south-east England, and as attendance figures dropped dramatically. Mr Di'Iasio said: ""I think everyone in the country has known that there's going to be a surge and a peak, particularly in January."" An earlier decision would have meant that teachers could have made preparations in time for children to go back as normal, he said. Parent, Chihera Mai Shingi, agreed with the decision, posting on the BBC News Family and Education Facebook page: ""We got Covid from our Year 7 daughter. Schools should be closed."" But Charlotte Elizabeth Hayward expressed her concerns about schools carrying out the testing: ""Space? Staff? Resources (financial and otherwise). ""It's not just a quick set up. We have 1,600 kids and around 200 staff. All on an already fit to burst site. The man does not have a clue."" Chairman of the Commons Education Select Committee Robert Halfon said teachers and support staff should be made a priority for vaccinations. ""If we can make sure that they are vaccinated and they are safe, it's less likely that schools will have to close, and this two weeks has to mean two weeks. ""Schools just can't be a revolving door that never stands still, open one day, shut the next."" Joint general secretary of the National Education Union, Dr Mary Bousted, said she was astonished that any pupils were going back at all before 18 January. ""A longer period of online working for all primary, secondary and college students could suppress virus levels and buy time both for the roll out of the vaccine and to put in place measures that can keep schools safer."" She added: ""We would like Gavin Williamson to explain, if schools are not centres of transmission, why school age pupils are now the most infected age groups?"" Richard Sheriff, executive head teacher of Harrogate Grammar School, said regular testing could be key to minimising classroom disruptions but criticised the government for announcing the plans just days before the Christmas break. ""Testing and the delayed return is a realisticÂ program, but it still puts a huge amountÂ of pressure on schools,"" he said. ""We need reassurances in the physical arrangements for testing, including extra space and support on the ground to make it happen."" The government says schools are being supported financially to set up testing and argued that they are only being closed as a ""last resort"" because of the rising number of cases.

"Extra Covid tests are taking place across England and Scotland in areas where new variants have been found. This is known as surge testing - its purpose is to stop the spread of new forms of Covid at the very earliest stage. Increased testing and enhanced contact tracing iscarried out in very specific locations,external- local authority areas, postcodes or even individual streets. Some of this is carried out by health officials going door-to-door. It includes testing people who do not haveCovid symptoms. The testing also helps scientists better understand the new variants.

The variants were initially named after the place where they were first seen, butthe World Health Organization (WHO) has announced a new naming systemwhich uses Greek letters instead. The PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test People tested under the new variant surge programmes are being offered a PCR test. This involves swabbing your nose or throat, dropping the swab in a vial of liquid and sending it to a lab for analysis. It is regarded as the most reliable test, but normally takes a day or longer to get a result. The lateral flow test This also involves a swab from the nose or throat, which is dropped into liquid. The solution is then added to a test strip which shows a result in 20-30 minutes. Wherever you are in the UK, if you havesymptomsyou should book afree test online,external.

"This video can not be played Parents and teachers have criticised the closure decisions Plans to close primary schools in some London boroughs but not others have ""no logic"", council leaders have said. About a million primary school pupilswill not return to lessonsas planned next week in a bid to cut the transmission of coronavirus. Schools in 10 London boroughs will remain open under government plans. London is under tier four restrictions following a spike in Covid-19 cases. The Department for Education said measures would be reviewed fortnightly. Danny Thorpe, Labour leader of the Royal Borough of Greenwich, said: ""In a case-by-case comparison, there appears to be no logic to how this list was brought together. What's happening with schools in January? School closures will be 'as short as possible' Should London be split into different Covid tiers? Coronavirus cases in London ""Kensington and Chelsea has one of the lowest infection rates for the whole of the capital, yet their children and young people are being afforded the extra protection that apparently Royal Greenwich students don't need."" The governmentthreatened Greenwich Council with legal actionafter it issued advice to schools to move to online learning for the last few days of term. All primary schools had been due to fully reopen on 4 January but under government plans those in 23 London boroughs will remain closed. Children of key workers and vulnerable pupils will still be able to attend lessons. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said schools would be reopened as soon as possible. Testing for primary school staff would then follow later in January. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan called the plans ""nonsensical"". The mayor said he had written to the government calling for a ""delay to all London schools opening until mid-January"". He said: ""Many parents in London live in one borough but their children go to school in another borough. ""It shows the government don't understand our city."" Richard Watts, Labour leader of Islington Council, said: ""It is deeply frustrating that the government has made this announcement at the last minute."" It comes ""weeks after it was clear coronavirus cases were surging in London"", he said. Some school leaders being told to keep their doors closed for longer are also unhappy at the government's decision. Brinder Bains, deputy head teacher at Ronald Ross Primary School in Wandsworth, said it was ""really unfortunate"" her staff would have to wait longer to welcome back pupils. She said many children did not have the ""devices or connectivity"" to make home learning work. Ms Bains said: ""I know the kids want to be at school. ""They want to be face to face with teachers and with their classmates. That's the best environment for them."" About a million primary school pupils will not return to lessons as planned next week Schools in the City of London, Camden, Greenwich, Hackney, Haringey, Harrow, Islington, Kingston, Lambeth and Lewisham, will open. All of these areas, apart from Camden, have aninfection rate higher than the England average. In the week leading up to 25 December, the combined infection rate for Hackney and the City of London was 810.75 cases per 100,000 people. The average rate in England is 549.5 cases per 100,000. The Department for Education said decisions on school closures and openings were based on new infections, positivity rates, and pressures on the NHS. It added plans were made in consultation with Public Health England, the NHS, the Joint Biosecurity Centre and across government. A spokeswoman for the department said: ""In response to concerning data about the spread of coronavirus, we have implemented the contingency framework for education in a small number of areas of the country, requiring schools to provide remote learning to all but vulnerable and critical worker children and exam years. ""Decisions on which areas will be subject to the contingency framework are based on close work with PHE, the NHS, the Joint Biosecurity Centre and across government to monitor the number of new infections, positivity rates, and pressures on the NHS.""

The care home said its staff were working in very challenging circumstances A retirement home in Belgium has been hit by a major coronavirus outbreak, which has seen at least
26 residents lose their lives and more than 100 test positive. The outbreak was detected a
few days after the 5 December visit to the Hemelrijck home in Mol of a volunteer
dressed as Santa Claus. The visitor has since
tested positive for Covid-19, although a health official has told the AFP it is
not yet certain that he is the source of the outbreak. Regional health spokesman
Joris Moonens said there was no suggestion the visitor knew he was infected when he attended the home, and in the absence of a formal complaint no inquiry has been launched. Belgian virologist Marc Van
Ranst tweeted last Friday that most of the infected residents carried the same variant
of the virus as the volunteer. The home itself said its
staff were continuing âto work in very challenging circumstances to give the
residents all the necessary care and to keep the outbreak under controlâ. The UK's leading share index - the FTSE 100 - hassuffered its worst year since the height of the financial crisis. Pension savers and investors' nest-eggs have been savaged as the the FTSE 100 index fell 14.3% over the year, marking its worst performance since 2008, when it slumped 31.3%. Despite the poor performance, the blue-chip index has recovered significantly since the start of the global pandemic when it was a third lower than now. Analysts say that next year is likely to be better for investors. ""The factors which worked against the FTSE-100 in 2020 - the pandemic, a deep recession and Brexit - will start to fade into the background,"" says Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. The UK has reported another
55,892 daily cases of coronavirus, up from 50,023 on Wednesday. It also recorded a further
964 deaths within 28 days of a positive test, compared with 981 yesterday. Tougher coronavirus restrictions came into force for millions more people in England today, with some 20 million entering the toughest tier four measures. They join people across the UK who have seen tougher rules brought in over the festive period. Head hereto find out the rules where you live. A couple swiftly arranged a same-day weddingto avoid missing out when their area moved to the highest tier of coronavirus restrictions in England. The drama started at 15:00 GMT yesterday when it was announced Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire would move from tier three to tier four at 00:01 today. Weddings with up to 15 guests are allowed in tier three but only services with ""exceptional circumstances"" are permitted in tier four. Jemma and Josh Copestake, from Shirebrook, Derbyshire, had been due to marry on Saturday. Jemma, 32, said when the new measures were announced she was resigned to the service, which had already been postponed from August, having to be pushed back again. But her sister persuaded her they should try to make it happen that day - and when the vicar confirmed she was available to lead the service, they summoned guests to the Nottinghamshire village of Church Warsop, for a wedding at 17:30. As well as the 15 invited guests inside the church, more than 100 friends and locals stood socially distanced outside to welcome them to the ceremony, which was also streamed online. Instead of a wedding reception, the newlyweds rounded off their day with a takeaway pizza at home. ""It may not have been how we planned it but it was beautiful,"" Jemma said. Marine FC are in the eighth tier of English football A non-league English football teamis holding a raffle to recoup some of the Â£100,000 they stand to loseas their match with Tottenham Hotspur is now having to be played behind closed doors. Marine FC play Jose Mourinho's Premier League team in the third round of the FA Cup on 10 January, but fans will be barred from the Merseyside stadium due to coronavirus restrictions. Liverpool's new tier three statusmeans there will now be no crowd inside the 3,185-capacity stadium, costing the eighth-tier club not only gate receipts, but also about Â£70,000 in sponsorship deals. Marine's chief executive officer James Leary said it was necessary but ""galling"". The part-timers have instead launched a virtual Â£10 match ticket raffle - the top prize is the chance to replace the manager in the dugout for a pre-season friendly - which could raise about Â£30,000. Simon ReadBusiness Reporter British people spent less and saved more in 2020as the pandemic led to shops, pubs and attractions being closed down. Consumer spending was down 7.1%, says Barclaycard, which tracks almost half of all credit and debit card spending. However, spending on essential items climbed 4.1%, while independent businesses benefited as many more of us shopped locally. The Barclaycard data showed that we spent an extra 28.6% at independent food and drink shops, such as off-licences, butchers and bakeries, compared with a year earlier. Online grocery shopping surged 70.3% over the year, spending on fuel fell by more than a fifth - 20.3%, and we also spent 15.6% less on clothing. Meanwhile, a separate survey from Aldermore Bank found Brits working from home saved an average Â£110 a week. Health workers face burnout, soaring sickness levels and ""intolerable"" pressures because of the ongoing coronavirus crisis, union leaders have warned. Employers have been urged do all they can to find ways of maintaining staff levels at ""swamped"" hospitals. Unison warned that staff were being ""pushed to the brink"" as hospitals struggle to cope with rising coronavirus cases and winter pressures. The union said every option should be explored to avoid simply making healthcare workers do extra shifts, such as recruiting former NHS staff. Unison's assistant general secretary, Christina McAnea, said: ""Lots of people came forward during the first wave offering to return to the NHS and everything possible should be done to ensure they can help. ""We know that many who offered were not used. ""The government must learn lessons that allowing NHS staff shortages to go unchecked causes immense damage when the chips are down."" States like Florida are vaccinating older residents Twenty million vaccinations by the end of 2020 was the goal set by Trump administration officials - but the US has fallen far short of that so far. As of Wednesday,more than 12 million Covid vaccine doseshave rolled out, butonly 2.7 million peoplehad received their first dose, according to the Centers for Disease Control. The same day, the US saw a record3,927 Covid-related deathsin 24 hours, bringing the total number of deaths in the country tomore than 342,000. Some of the lag is due to reporting delays from across the country, but members of Operation Warp Speed, President Trump's vaccine development and rollout programme, also acknowledge the numbers haven't met expectations. Officials promise things will speed up in the coming weeks, especially as health centres learn how to store and administer the vaccines. As the rollout continues, states are taking the initiative to immunise vulnerable groups. Colorado, Texas and Florida, for example, are now vaccinating older residents along with health workers. President-elect Joe Biden, who will take office on 20 January, has promised to distribute 100m vaccines in his first 100 days, though the exact details of how his rollout might differ from President Trump's remain to be seen. Key workers and high-risk people are already getting vaccines in China China has given conditional approval for a coronavirus vaccine developed by state-owned drugmaker Sinopharm to be given
to the general public. The decision came a day after the firm
said interim data showed its vaccine had a 79% efficacy rate in phase three
trials. Several Chinese-made vaccines at a late trial stage are already in use in China after being granted emergency licences. Beijing hopes to inoculate tens of millions of people by mid-February, the start of the Chinese New Year. Some experts have given a cautious
welcome to the Sinopharm vaccine however, pointing out that the firm has not
made public any detailed data from the trials. You can read more on this story here. Coronavirus case rates are continuing to rise in all regions of England, according to the latest weekly figures from Public Health England. London's rate of new cases stood at 735.5 per 100,000 people in the seven days to 27 December, up from 711.9 in the previous week. Eastern England saw the second highest rate (551.3, up from 510.8) followed by south-east England (450.6, up from 427.4). Yorkshire and the Humber had the lowest rate: 188.3, up from 172.4. Public Health England medical director Dr Yvonne Doyle said: ""The Christmas week saw a worrying rise in cases across every region of the country, particularly among adults in their 20s and 30s. ""We must not now add further fuel to the fire, as meeting in close and large groups this New Year's Eve risks further transmission. ""The way we can beat this virus remains the same, whatever the variant. Reduce close contact with others and follow the guidance."" Smitha MundasadHealth reporter Alongside the UK medicines regulatorâs approval of a second
coronavirus vaccine yesterday came a significant shift in strategy designed to
vaccinate as many vulnerable people as fast as possible. Central to the new plan is a delay of up to 12 weeks between
administering  the first and second doses required for each vaccine. This will buy more time to vaccinate more people. But does it have an impact on the overall effectiveness of
the jabs? Professor Peter Openshaw, of Imperial College London, told
BBC News that it was a ""highly plausible"" strategy. He says there is ""pretty convincing"" data, published
within MHRA (Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency) documents, showing
some enhancement of antibody protection when the second dose of the
Oxford/AstraZeneca jab is delayed. But he says the Pfizer jab has not been tested in the same way so there is no comparable evidence. ""I would reassure people that just after the first
dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine it is pretty solid protection that cuts in
at about two weeks and it looks like that protection will last for some time,"" he adds. Prof Openshaw agreed it made ârational senseâ to get the first dose to
as many people are possible, but he said, âit is a bit surprising given
we donât have data to support this delay.â Along with many other scientists he says long term
monitoring of both jabs will be crucial to ensure people get adequate
protection. The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine was on Wednesday approved for use in the UK Plans to delay giving out the second dose of the coronavirus vaccine have been criticised by GP leaders - who say the move will cause huge problems for thousands of partially-vaccinated elderly and vulnerable people. On Wednesday the government announcedit had changed its vaccination strategy, saying it would now prioritise giving out the first doses of the vaccines. It said second doses of both the Oxford-AstraZeneca and the Pfizer/BioNTech jab would then be given up to 12 weeks after the first dose. The initial plan for the Pfizer vacine was two jabs within 21 days, GPs have warned the change will affect tens of thousands of elderly and vulnerable patients who were due to get their second dose of the Pfizer jab in the coming days and weeks. The head of the British Medical Association's GP committee said it was ""grossly unfair"" to delay the second jabs for high-risk patients and the policy was causing huge logistical problems. Pfizertold the Guardian,externalthat there was no data to demonstrate that protection after the initial dose was sustained after 21 days. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Freight lorries arrive at Dover hours before the new rules start Boris Johnson has said the UK has ""freedom in our hands"" and must make the most of it as the country prepares to leave EU trading rules at 23:00 GMT. Historic changes to rules on travel, trade, immigration and security are to come into force as the UK enters a new era of relations with the continent. UK officials have insisted new border systems are ""ready to go"" amid concerns about possible delays at ports. The PM said the UK could now do ""things differently and if necessary better"". The trade deal agreed by the two sides on Christmas Eve, and passed by MPs on Wednesday, avoids the need for import taxes - tariffs - after the UK leaves the EU's internal market and customs union on 1 January. While fears of giant tailbacks of lorries at Dover have receded, uncertainty remains about new customs rules and the government has warned there will be ""some disruption"" in the coming days and weeks. Dover-Calais route 'will work well on 1 January' Gibraltar gets UK-Spain deal to keep open border A quick guide to what's in the Brexit deal Brexit: Seven things that will change To reduce the risk of delays, the UK is phasing in checks on goods entering the country from the continent over a six-month period up to July 2021. But some new customs procedures will come into force on the UK-side immediately from 11pm, such as on imports of alcohol, tobacco, chemicals and controlled drugs. EU member states are introducing full customs declarations and other controls on UK exports from 23:00. Among the other things that will change from 23:00 GMT: Free movement of people between the UK and EU countries will end - to be replaced in the UK by a""points-based"" immigration system,external Anyone from the UK who wants to stay in most of the EU for more than 90 days in any 180-day period will need a visa Duty-free shopping will return,,externalwith people coming back to the UK from the EU able to bring up to 42 litres of beer, 18 litres of wine, four litres of spirits and 200 cigarettes without paying tax EU citizens wanting to move to the UK (except those from the Irish Republic) will face the same points-based system as people elsewhere in the world UK police willlose instant access to EU-wide databaseson criminal records, fingerprints and wanted persons Traders in England, Scotland and Wales will have to complete more paperwork when dealing with EU countries Unlike the rest of the UK, Northern Ireland will continue to follow many of the EU's rules, as its border with the Republic of Ireland remains all but invisible. And the UK will gradually be able to keep more of the fish caught in its own waters, while the European Court of Justice will cease to have any role in deciding disputes between the UK and EU. If you are Boris Johnson this is huge, and exciting. If you are a business that's affected it might mean a big new opportunity, but it might also mean really big disruption and lots of extra hassle. The fact that there is a trade deal doesn't take all of the risk away. The treaty contains lots of uncertainty, not least for the biggest part of the economy: the service sector. Getting the agreement finalised in the time was a big achievement for both sides but there is a lot that it just doesn't cover that will, in time, have to be worked out somehow. Read Laura's blog Mr Johnson - who led the Leave campaign in the 2016 Brexit referendum and took the UK out of the EU in January six months after becoming prime minister, said the UK was on the verge of an ""amazing moment"". In his New Year message, the PM said he wanted the UK to be an ""open, generous and outward looking"" country that was a global leader in new technologies, fighting climate change and promoting free trade. ""We have our freedom in our hands and it is up to us to make the most of it."" And he urged the four nations of the United Kingdom to put the Brexit divisions of recent years behind them and focus on their common bonds. ""I think it will be the overwhelming instinct of the people of this country to come together as one United Kingdom - England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - working together to express our values around the world."" Intensive preparations have been taking place over the past two weeks to prepare the UK for the coming changes. The UK's Countdown Plan has involved operational testing of infrastructure at the border and close co-operation with France, Holland and Belgium. A government spokesman said: ""The border systems and infrastructure we need are in place, and we are ready for the UK's new start."" The UK Parliament was recalled to ratify the deal But concerns remain that many small businesses are not prepared for the changes and that with lorries without the correct paperwork set to be turned back at Dover and other ports, delays are inevitable. Traffic volumes are expected to be lower than normal on 1 January due to the pandemic but are expected to pick up from Monday, when the new procedures and the UK's contingency measures are expected to be tested. The government said450 ""Kent access"" permits had been issued to HGV lorries intendingto cross the channel at Dover on 1 January and hauliers arriving without them would be identified and subject to a Â£300 fine. One logistics firm told the BBC it would not send any trucks across until 10 Januarydue to congestion fears although Channel Tunnel Operator Getalink has said it expects the new systems to work smoothly. Brexit happened on 31 January 2020, but the UK has continued to follow Brussels' trade rules until now, while the deal was thrashed out. It completes the process set in motion in June 2016, when, in a referendum, UK voterschose by 52% to 48% to leave the EU. The free trade deal - agreed on Christmas Eve after nine months of negotiations - finallypassed into UK lawearly on Thursday morning - having also been backed by Brussels. This video can not be played Laura Kuenssberg challenges Boris Johnson on Brexit and vaccines But opponents say the country will still be worse off than it was while in the EU - and there is still uncertainty about what it will happen to banking and services, which are a major part of the UK economy. Meanwhile, the UK and Spain have reached agreementon a political framework for Gibraltar which will pave the way for a separate UK-EU treaty regarding the British overseas territory, which was not covered by the trade deal.

She originally said there would be 40,000 doses but the Welsh Government later    said it expected to reach that figure by the second week of January. Meanwhile Public Health Wales said 35,335 people had hadthe Pfizer jab. When asked how long the rollout of the latest vaccine would take, Dr Richardson toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfast: ""We can only give it at the rate at which it arrives, so some of that is not predictable with some of the international players in the vaccine manufacturing world but of course with Oxford we have a lot more control. ""So, by the time the Oxford-AstraZeneca is manufactured using a good steady flow, we'll be able to give you some of those predictions, but just now what we can say is we are doing those that are most vulnerable first, and we will get to everybody in their turn - please bear with us."" She also said it was ""excellent news"" the two doses could be administered up to 12 weeks apart, meaning more people could get their first jab sooner. She urged people to follow Wales' coronavirus restrictions as they celebrate new year: ""Please for everybody - take extra care. ""That'hands, face, space',externalmessage is really important, especially tonight, celebrate safely and enjoy yourself safely. ""It's going to be a while before we see vaccine turn the corner on those hospitalisations."" When will I get the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine? Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid vaccine clinics to be set up in Wales Covid vaccine: Older people's commissioner warns of 'confusion' Dr Helen Alefounder, a GP in Colwyn Bay, Conwy county, said she had not been told what date she would be administering the jab from, but planning was in full swing. Residents in Wales vaccinated by heath board, to 27 December 5,487Aneurin Bevan 4,604Betsi Cadwaladr 5,706Cardiff & Vale 4,789Cwm Taf Morgannwg 5,276 + 3,250Hywel Dda and Powys 5,285Swansea Bay She said: ""It's not just as simple as somebody turning up and having a vaccination, it's everything else that has to be considered with it. ""Logistically it's a huge, huge ask. ""However, we do it every year for flu, so we really have a good background knowledge of everything that we need to do and everything we need to provide. ""It's just simple things like making sure that there's places for people to park and making sure that you can maintain social distancing and making sure that you can allow people time to sit afterwards after their vaccine in case of reactions."" Health boards across Wales are warning that despite the hope offered by the Covid vaccines, hospitals are under relentless pressure in this latest wave of infections. On Thursday, Cardiff and Vale University Health Board announced it would cease all non-urgent surgery and outpatient appointments in January. It follows similar decisions to halt non-urgent treatment at theSwansea BayandAneurin Bevanhealth boards earlier in December. ""This is to redeploy staff in support of urgent and emergency care, including critical care,"" said Steve Curry, the chief operating officer of Cardiff and Vale. The board said it had also opened a new ""surge facility"" at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff. ""The additional Lakeside Wing bed capacity will be used to support demand in the coming weeks,"" added Mr Curry. The medical director at neighbouring Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board said all its sites ""remain under significant pressure with unprecedented demand"". ""This is extremely challenging for out staff,"" said Nick Lyons. ""We currently have more than 600 suspected, confirmed or recovering Covid-19 patients in our hospitals and ITUs across our sites are over capacity. The situation is extremely serious."" Royal Glamorgan Hospital consultant Dr Dai Samuel says the NHS in Wales is ""teetering on the brink"" Dr Dai Samuel, a consultant hepatologist at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital in Llantrisant, Rhondda Cynon Taf, has been working on Covid wards during the pandemic. He said the rollout of a second vaccine was good news, but urged people to still follow restrictions: ""The position with the vaccine is very good but we are in an acute situation. ""It's very difficult across the NHS. We are teetering on the brink. A few days of bad luck can bring us to our knees. It's very challenging. ""I just say [to people], carry on listening to what you have been told for months."" More than 35,000 people have now received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in Wales, including people such as healthcare workers who work in Wales but live over the border in England. Almost 13,000 of these vaccines were given in the past week. Plaid Cymru has called on the Welsh Government to ask the UK government to publish evidence to justify increasing the period between the two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine from 21 days to 12 weeks. In a letter to the Health Minister Vaughan Gething, the party's health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said the ""sudden switch"" represented ""a very significant departure"" from previous guidelines. He added there were ""very real concerns"" that a longer delay between doses ""could significantly decrease the effectiveness of the vaccine"". The Welsh Conservatives criticised the speed of the rollout. Health spokesman Andrew RT Davies said: ""Three weeks ago, the first Covid-19 vaccine was given in Wales, and since that time we have sadly seen confusion and hope drop away. ""Many people over 80 in Wales were desperately waiting for their appointment to do their bit and have the vaccine but as we quickly learnt they would have to wait longer,"" he said.

"This video can not be played Countries around the world welcomed 2021 with fireworks, but crowds were only allowed at some displays New Year celebrations around the world have been muted as many countries struggle to curb new spikes in coronavirus cases. Fireworks displays and other public gatherings were cancelled from Sydney to New York. Festivities were particularly restricted in Europe, amidfears over a more contagious variant of the virus. France mobilised 100,000 police to break up New Year's Eve parties and enforce a night-time curfew. More than 1.8 million people have died with the virus across the world since the start of the pandemic a year ago. More than 81 million cases have been reported. New Year, but not quite as we know it Which countries have been hit hardest? InFrance,the government ordered avisible security presence in urban areas from 20:00 (19:00 GMT) on Thursday, when the curfew began. In Paris half of the metro lines were closed. Several departments banned the sale of fireworks and limited alcohol sales as part of measures to stop the unrest and torching of cars that often takes place on the final night of the year. Although incidents of violence were reportedly fewer, police were attacked while trying to break up several large illegal raves. In Alsace, a 25-year-old man died when a firework he was holding exploded, local media said. France has had two lockdowns and bars, restaurants and cultural attractions will remain shut into the new year. In his New Year's address, President Emmanuel Macron tried to address criticism of the slow pace of vaccination in France, vowing to avoid ""unjustifiable delays"". Police are enforcing the curfew in central Paris InEngland- where the new coronavirus variant is spreading fast and more than 40 million people in the worst-affected regions are forced to stay at home -UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged people to follow the rules. ""That means not meeting up with friends or family indoors, unless they're in the same household or support bubble, and avoiding large gatherings of any kind,"" he said on Wednesday. This video can not be played Boris Johnson says he's confident the UK's Covid situation will be ""very much better"" by 5 April London's streets were quiet during New Year's Eve after police there warned people to celebrate at home. Instead of the usual celebrations in front of the London Eye, a giant fireworks and light show was held across various locations in the capital. 'We're happy the big night out is cancelled' Irelandmoved to its highest level of restrictions on Thursday, banning all household visits, closing all non-essential retail and limiting travel to 5km (three miles). Germanyis currently under lockdown until 10 January. The government has banned the sale of fireworks and placed tight restrictions on the number of people who can gather in public. In what is expected to be her last New Year's Eve address as chancellor as she plans to step down in nine months, Angela Merkel took aim at conspiracy theorists. Making a rare show of emotion, she said she could only imagine how cynical and cruel their dangerous lies must feel to those who had lost loved ones to the virus. InItaly,a 22:00 curfew was imposed, and bars, restaurants and most shops were closed. Meanwhile, Pope Francis is not leading New Year's Eve and New Year's Day services in Rome after suffering a recurrence of chronic hip pain. The Netherlandsis also under a lockdown, which is set to last until 19 January. Its usual countdown took placebehind closed doors at a football stadium in Amsterdam.,external Turkeyhas begun a four-day-long lockdown. Officials placed restrictions on festivities in many states and cities. In New York, just a handful of people were allowed into Times Square to watch the famous midnight ball drop - mainly frontline workers, first responders and their families. Stars performed as usual at the televised event. In New York, only a small number of people were allowed into Times Square to see the celebrations Fireworks were cancelled in cities including San Francisco and Las Vegas. How new variant was identified Covid vaccines compared In a New-Year address posted on Twitter,President Donald Trump hailed the rapid creation of vaccines,externalas a ""medical miracle"" and paid tribute to the work of Operation Warp Speed, the US programme aimed at producing and delivering vaccines. But he failed to mention that nearly 350,000 Americans had died with the virus. One of the first nations to ring in the New Year wasAustralia. The Sydney fireworks display went ahead, but crowds were not allowed to gather on the city's harbour to enjoy it. ""We don't want to create any super-spreading events on New Year's Eve,"" New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian said. Many Sydney residents simply watched the pyrotechnics on TV at home, where gatherings were limited to five guests.

"Mitch McConnell (C) heading for the Senate floor on Tuesday US Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell has rejected calls from an unlikely alliance of President Donald Trump, congressional Democrats and some Republicans to boost coronavirus aid. The House of Representatives, held by the Democrats, had voted to increase aid cheques to Americans to $2,000. Dozens of House Republicans, reluctant to defy Mr Trump, backed the increase. But Mr McConnell's objections mean there will not be a direct vote on a revised Covid aid bill in the Senate. Mitch McConnell said raising aid cheques would be ""another fire hose of borrowed money"". The move could in effect kill off Mr Trump's demands for bigger cash handouts to help the economy recover, correspondents say. Congress had initially agreed to the smaller $600 (Â£440) payments in a Covid relief and government funding bill. Mr Trump sent that back to Capitol Hill before Christmas, saying the stimulus payment should be higher. He eventually, and grudgingly, signed the original bill with the lower payments into law on Sunday, but has continued to demand more money. On Monday, House Democrats - usually sworn political foes of Mr Trump - passed the measure for $2,000 cheques that he requested. US reports first known case of Covid variant How Covid-19 altered world events in 2020 The casualties of viral conspiracy theories in 2020 ""Unless Republicans have a death wish, and it is also the right thing to do, they must approve the $2,000 payments ASAP,"" the president tweeted on Tuesday. The total number of people who have died with Covid in the US stands at nearly 350,000. There are concerns that the figure could continue to surge following Christmas and New Year gatherings. California meanwhile became the second state to confirm a case of the new strain of the virus, considered to be highly contagious.The first case was confirmed in Colorado. The Kentucky senator rejected Democrats' calls for the upper chamber to vote on the $2,000 cheques package passed by their counterparts in the House. He said the bill had ""no realistic path to quickly pass the Senate"". Speaking in the chamber on Wednesday, he said: ""The Senate is not going to be bullied into rushing out more borrowed money into the hands of Democrats' rich friends who don't need the help."" Instead he offered to roll the proposal for bigger cheques into another bill to include other measures that have been requested by Mr Trump but raised objections from Democratic leaders. One would end legal protection for tech companies, known as Section 230. The other would set up a bipartisan commission to investigate Mr Trump's unsubstantiated claims of systemic electoral fraud. Democrats said Mr McConnell's proposal was merely a legislative poison pill designed to kill higher stimulus payments. Liberal Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent who votes with Democrats, said on the Senate floor: ""All we are asking for is a vote. What is the problem? ""If you want to vote against $2,000 checks for your state, vote against it."" Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said: ""What we're seeing right now is leader McConnell trying to kill the cheques - the $2,000 cheques desperately needed by so many American families."" And House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said: ""These Republicans in the Senate seem to have an endless tolerance for other people's sadness."" The party usually professes an opposition to government spending as an article of faith, but some of its top conservative senators have rallied behind Mr Trump's call for $2,000 cheques. They include Marco Rubio of Florida and Josh Hawley of Missouri, both considered possible presidential contenders in 2024.

The care home said its staff were working in very challenging circumstances A retirement home in Belgium has been hit by a major coronavirus outbreak, which has seen at least
26 residents lose their lives and more than 100 test positive. The outbreak was detected a
few days after the 5 December visit to the Hemelrijck home in Mol of a volunteer
dressed as Santa Claus. The visitor has since
tested positive for Covid-19, although a health official has told the AFP it is
not yet certain that he is the source of the outbreak. Regional health spokesman
Joris Moonens said there was no suggestion the visitor knew he was infected when he attended the home, and in the absence of a formal complaint no inquiry has been launched. Belgian virologist Marc Van
Ranst tweeted last Friday that most of the infected residents carried the same variant
of the virus as the volunteer. The home itself said its
staff were continuing âto work in very challenging circumstances to give the
residents all the necessary care and to keep the outbreak under controlâ. The UK's leading share index - the FTSE 100 - hassuffered its worst year since the height of the financial crisis. Pension savers and investors' nest-eggs have been savaged as the the FTSE 100 index fell 14.3% over the year, marking its worst performance since 2008, when it slumped 31.3%. Despite the poor performance, the blue-chip index has recovered significantly since the start of the global pandemic when it was a third lower than now. Analysts say that next year is likely to be better for investors. ""The factors which worked against the FTSE-100 in 2020 - the pandemic, a deep recession and Brexit - will start to fade into the background,"" says Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. The UK has reported another
55,892 daily cases of coronavirus, up from 50,023 on Wednesday. It also recorded a further
964 deaths within 28 days of a positive test, compared with 981 yesterday. Tougher coronavirus restrictions came into force for millions more people in England today, with some 20 million entering the toughest tier four measures. They join people across the UK who have seen tougher rules brought in over the festive period. Head hereto find out the rules where you live. A couple swiftly arranged a same-day weddingto avoid missing out when their area moved to the highest tier of coronavirus restrictions in England. The drama started at 15:00 GMT yesterday when it was announced Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire would move from tier three to tier four at 00:01 today. Weddings with up to 15 guests are allowed in tier three but only services with ""exceptional circumstances"" are permitted in tier four. Jemma and Josh Copestake, from Shirebrook, Derbyshire, had been due to marry on Saturday. Jemma, 32, said when the new measures were announced she was resigned to the service, which had already been postponed from August, having to be pushed back again. But her sister persuaded her they should try to make it happen that day - and when the vicar confirmed she was available to lead the service, they summoned guests to the Nottinghamshire village of Church Warsop, for a wedding at 17:30. As well as the 15 invited guests inside the church, more than 100 friends and locals stood socially distanced outside to welcome them to the ceremony, which was also streamed online. Instead of a wedding reception, the newlyweds rounded off their day with a takeaway pizza at home. ""It may not have been how we planned it but it was beautiful,"" Jemma said. Marine FC are in the eighth tier of English football A non-league English football teamis holding a raffle to recoup some of the Â£100,000 they stand to loseas their match with Tottenham Hotspur is now having to be played behind closed doors. Marine FC play Jose Mourinho's Premier League team in the third round of the FA Cup on 10 January, but fans will be barred from the Merseyside stadium due to coronavirus restrictions. Liverpool's new tier three statusmeans there will now be no crowd inside the 3,185-capacity stadium, costing the eighth-tier club not only gate receipts, but also about Â£70,000 in sponsorship deals. Marine's chief executive officer James Leary said it was necessary but ""galling"". The part-timers have instead launched a virtual Â£10 match ticket raffle - the top prize is the chance to replace the manager in the dugout for a pre-season friendly - which could raise about Â£30,000. Simon ReadBusiness Reporter British people spent less and saved more in 2020as the pandemic led to shops, pubs and attractions being closed down. Consumer spending was down 7.1%, says Barclaycard, which tracks almost half of all credit and debit card spending. However, spending on essential items climbed 4.1%, while independent businesses benefited as many more of us shopped locally. The Barclaycard data showed that we spent an extra 28.6% at independent food and drink shops, such as off-licences, butchers and bakeries, compared with a year earlier. Online grocery shopping surged 70.3% over the year, spending on fuel fell by more than a fifth - 20.3%, and we also spent 15.6% less on clothing. Meanwhile, a separate survey from Aldermore Bank found Brits working from home saved an average Â£110 a week. Health workers face burnout, soaring sickness levels and ""intolerable"" pressures because of the ongoing coronavirus crisis, union leaders have warned. Employers have been urged do all they can to find ways of maintaining staff levels at ""swamped"" hospitals. Unison warned that staff were being ""pushed to the brink"" as hospitals struggle to cope with rising coronavirus cases and winter pressures. The union said every option should be explored to avoid simply making healthcare workers do extra shifts, such as recruiting former NHS staff. Unison's assistant general secretary, Christina McAnea, said: ""Lots of people came forward during the first wave offering to return to the NHS and everything possible should be done to ensure they can help. ""We know that many who offered were not used. ""The government must learn lessons that allowing NHS staff shortages to go unchecked causes immense damage when the chips are down."" States like Florida are vaccinating older residents Twenty million vaccinations by the end of 2020 was the goal set by Trump administration officials - but the US has fallen far short of that so far. As of Wednesday,more than 12 million Covid vaccine doseshave rolled out, butonly 2.7 million peoplehad received their first dose, according to the Centers for Disease Control. The same day, the US saw a record3,927 Covid-related deathsin 24 hours, bringing the total number of deaths in the country tomore than 342,000. Some of the lag is due to reporting delays from across the country, but members of Operation Warp Speed, President Trump's vaccine development and rollout programme, also acknowledge the numbers haven't met expectations. Officials promise things will speed up in the coming weeks, especially as health centres learn how to store and administer the vaccines. As the rollout continues, states are taking the initiative to immunise vulnerable groups. Colorado, Texas and Florida, for example, are now vaccinating older residents along with health workers. President-elect Joe Biden, who will take office on 20 January, has promised to distribute 100m vaccines in his first 100 days, though the exact details of how his rollout might differ from President Trump's remain to be seen. Key workers and high-risk people are already getting vaccines in China China has given conditional approval for a coronavirus vaccine developed by state-owned drugmaker Sinopharm to be given
to the general public. The decision came a day after the firm
said interim data showed its vaccine had a 79% efficacy rate in phase three
trials. Several Chinese-made vaccines at a late trial stage are already in use in China after being granted emergency licences. Beijing hopes to inoculate tens of millions of people by mid-February, the start of the Chinese New Year. Some experts have given a cautious
welcome to the Sinopharm vaccine however, pointing out that the firm has not
made public any detailed data from the trials. You can read more on this story here. Coronavirus case rates are continuing to rise in all regions of England, according to the latest weekly figures from Public Health England. London's rate of new cases stood at 735.5 per 100,000 people in the seven days to 27 December, up from 711.9 in the previous week. Eastern England saw the second highest rate (551.3, up from 510.8) followed by south-east England (450.6, up from 427.4). Yorkshire and the Humber had the lowest rate: 188.3, up from 172.4. Public Health England medical director Dr Yvonne Doyle said: ""The Christmas week saw a worrying rise in cases across every region of the country, particularly among adults in their 20s and 30s. ""We must not now add further fuel to the fire, as meeting in close and large groups this New Year's Eve risks further transmission. ""The way we can beat this virus remains the same, whatever the variant. Reduce close contact with others and follow the guidance."" Smitha MundasadHealth reporter Alongside the UK medicines regulatorâs approval of a second
coronavirus vaccine yesterday came a significant shift in strategy designed to
vaccinate as many vulnerable people as fast as possible. Central to the new plan is a delay of up to 12 weeks between
administering  the first and second doses required for each vaccine. This will buy more time to vaccinate more people. But does it have an impact on the overall effectiveness of
the jabs? Professor Peter Openshaw, of Imperial College London, told
BBC News that it was a ""highly plausible"" strategy. He says there is ""pretty convincing"" data, published
within MHRA (Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency) documents, showing
some enhancement of antibody protection when the second dose of the
Oxford/AstraZeneca jab is delayed. But he says the Pfizer jab has not been tested in the same way so there is no comparable evidence. ""I would reassure people that just after the first
dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine it is pretty solid protection that cuts in
at about two weeks and it looks like that protection will last for some time,"" he adds. Prof Openshaw agreed it made ârational senseâ to get the first dose to
as many people are possible, but he said, âit is a bit surprising given
we donât have data to support this delay.â Along with many other scientists he says long term
monitoring of both jabs will be crucial to ensure people get adequate
protection. The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine was on Wednesday approved for use in the UK Plans to delay giving out the second dose of the coronavirus vaccine have been criticised by GP leaders - who say the move will cause huge problems for thousands of partially-vaccinated elderly and vulnerable people. On Wednesday the government announcedit had changed its vaccination strategy, saying it would now prioritise giving out the first doses of the vaccines. It said second doses of both the Oxford-AstraZeneca and the Pfizer/BioNTech jab would then be given up to 12 weeks after the first dose. The initial plan for the Pfizer vacine was two jabs within 21 days, GPs have warned the change will affect tens of thousands of elderly and vulnerable patients who were due to get their second dose of the Pfizer jab in the coming days and weeks. The head of the British Medical Association's GP committee said it was ""grossly unfair"" to delay the second jabs for high-risk patients and the policy was causing huge logistical problems. Pfizertold the Guardian,externalthat there was no data to demonstrate that protection after the initial dose was sustained after 21 days. Â© 2025 BBC.

According to councils, many secondary schools aim to return from 11 January, with some fully open on 6 January. The National Education Union Cymru called for face-to-face learning to be delayed until at least 18 January. It said more time was needed to understand thenew Covid-19 variant. Welsh schools have been asked to make provision for vulnerable children and children of key workers from next week. All pupils will be expected to take part in remote learning before their schools reopen for face-to-face teaching. Welsh councils say they are monitoring their local situation. Counties including Bridgend, Merthyr Tydfil, Rhondda Cynon Taf, Blaenau Gwent, Torfaen and Swansea are currently aiming to start the return of all pupils to school from Monday 11 January. In Monmouthshire all pupils are scheduled to return to school on Wednesday 6 January, with schools providing online learning on 4 and 5 January, unless they have inset days. In Conwy schools are also aiming to open to pupils from Wednesday 6 January ""subject to Welsh Government and Public Health Wales guidance and each individual school's assessment of their workforce"". Huw Hilditch-Roberts, Denbighshire council's lead member for education, said: ""Despite confirmed cases associated with Denbighshire schools being low, they are increasing and we have taken the difficult decision to follow Welsh Government guidance for schools to provide remote learning at the start of term, with the expectation that face-to-face learning will resume on Monday 11 January. ""We take any change to pupils' education very seriously and have not taken this decision lightly,"" he said. Powys council says pupils in years 7, 8 and 9 in the county will return from Wednesday 6 January, with older children starting face-to-face lessons again on 11 January. Secondary school pupils in England willnot return to face-to-face schooling until 18 January. In some of the highest infection areas in England, primary schools will also be closed until 18 January. In Scotland all primary and secondary schools are closed until 18 January at the earliest. In both nations, vulnerable children and children of key workers will return in the first week of term. The Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) Cymru's director Eithne Hughes said the overall situation was ""confusing"". She said: ""Some schools will have children in next week. Our view is that Welsh Government needs to make a central decision about schools reopening. After all they made a decision to put the country under the severest restrictions with no differentiation between councils on that."" ""Any decision needs to be based on the science... There needs to be transparency on the rationale. As soon as the science is available it should be released."" Children almost universally shrug off the virus, but the variant could alter the role they, and schools, play in spreading the virus. Mary van den Heuvel, senior policy officer at the National Education Union Cymru said: ""We know the Welsh Government took the sensible decision before Christmas to notify local authorities they had two weeks' flexibility at the start of term for returning to the classroom. ""But since then, we are in a Wales-wide alert level four situation. We need time for the scientists to find out more about this variant, and the transmissibility in school-aged children."" It was announced on Wednesday that primary schools in some areas of England will be closed until 18 January A Welsh Government spokesman said its priority was to enable pupils to receive face-to-face learning, where safe to do so. ""We have agreed with local authoritiesa common approach,externalto schools returning in January with some flexibility built in over the first two weeks of term. It is our expectation that pupils, when not in school, will continue to benefit from remote learning. ""As with any changes to schools and college openings for in-person teaching, decisions will be based on the latest scientific advice. We will continue to work in partnership with local authorities, schools and colleges on any changes to the scheduled opening arrangements. On Wednesday, Plaid Cymru education spokeswoman Sian Gwenllian questioned in the Senedd whether it was wise to have all pupils back in school even by 18 January, given the spread of the new variant of Covid-19. ""Aren't the signals currently suggesting that we should reconsider that policy and maintain on-site learning for smaller groups only beyond 18 January? ""If it's inevitable that schools will have to be closed for the majority of pupils, then, please, inform schools in good time. ""If closure is inevitable in order to prevent transmission, then we need to provide adequate warning so that teachers can prepare to teach as best as they can and for families to make their own arrangements too."" There are concerns closing schools isdetrimental to children, and in December Sally Holland, the children's commissioner for Wales, said she was not able to support further delays to in-school learning, except for individual schools in exceptional circumstances. ""Children and young people have told me that online learning, however well planned, is no substitute for being in the classroom. ""It clearly places already disadvantaged groups at a further disadvantage,"" she said. Staggered return for Wales' schools in January New coronavirus variant: What do we know?

"There is ""absolutely no reason"" schools in England will not be ready to mass test pupils when they return next term, the education secretary has said. Gavin Williamson said he wanted school closures to be as ""short as possible"" afterdelaying their reopeningamid surging coronavirus cases. It comes as people are being warnednot to gather on New Year's Eve. Some 20 million people in England have been told to ""stay at home"" after tier four was expanded at midnight. They join the 24 million already in the toughest restrictions - meaning non-essential businesses must close, and people should stay home unless they have a ""reasonable excuse"". How will mass testing help schools? Where has the new school term been delayed? We've all seen this coming, say angry heads Which areas are going into tier four and what are the rules? On Thursday the UK recorded a further 55,892 new Covid cases, as well as 964 more deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Defending the delay to term, Mr Williamson said the government was ""battling this hidden enemy"" - and that there was Â£78m of funding for schools to get testing up and running. Equipment such as personal protective equipment (PPE) would be delivered next week andthere would be support from the military. But teaching unions saidthe move did not go far enough, and one labelled it ""another last-minute mess"". Meanwhile an intensive care doctor has urged people not to gather ahead of the New Year and said those who do not follow social distancing rules or wear maskshave ""blood on their hands"". Prof Hugh Montgomery, professor of intensive care medicine at University College London, said: ""It is making me actually very angry now that people are laying the blame on the virus, and it is not the virus, it is people, people are not washing their hands, they are not wearing their masks."" NHS England medical director Prof Stephen Powis said it was ""absolutely vital"" people stayed home and did not mix, saying ""Covid loves a crowd"". Health Secretary Matt Hancock said people must take ""personal responsibility"". England's tier four restrictions mean people cannot meet other households indoors, unless they are part of a support bubble, while hospitality businesses and those such as hairdressers and nail bars must shut. In Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said thereshould be ""no gatherings, no house parties"" for Hogmanayas all of the mainland remains in the highest level of restrictions. Asix-week lockdownbegan in Northern Ireland on 26 December, while Wales also has a national lockdown with people banned from visiting other households. TESTING:How do I get a virus test? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters SCHOOLS:What will happen if children catch coronavirus? The warnings came after the UK announced theapproval of a second vaccine for coronavirus, the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab,with the first doses due to be given on Monday. The latest figures show 786,000 people have received the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine between 8 December and 27 December, NHS England said. GPs are to be offered Â£10 for every care home resident vaccinated and NHS staff will also be prioritised now that the Oxford jab has been approved, the health service said. Deepti Gurdasani, epidemiologist and senior lecturer at Queen Mary University of London, told BBC Radio 5 Live there appeared to be a ""bottleneck"" in the delivery of the jabs with the volume of vaccines given was ""six times lower"" than the two million per week target. A total of 232,169 people tested positive for Covid in England at least once in the week to 23 December, up 33% on the previous week and the highest weekly rise on record,the latest NHS Test and Trace figures show,external. Covid case rates are continuing to rise in all regions of England - with London's rate at 735.5 per 100,000 people in the seven days to 27 December, up from 711.9 the previous week, the latest Public Health England (PHE) surveillance report showed. Eastern England saw the second highest rate, 551.3 up from 510.8, followed by south-east England at 450.6, up from 427.4. PHE medical director Dr Yvonne Doyle said Christmas week had seen a worrying rise in cases, adding ""we must not now add further fuel on the fire"" by meeting in groups for New Year's Eve. Meanwhile, the NHS in London has been asked to make sure the London Nightingale hospital is ""reactivated and ready to admit patients"", an NHS spokesman said. Mr Williamson announced on Wednesday that secondary schools across most of England are to remain closed for an extra two weeks for most pupils, to help regain control of coronavirus amid concernsabout a fast-spreading new variant. Some primary schools in Covid hot-spots,externalwill not reopen on Monday, he said, but the Department for Education confirmed on Thursday there would be a review every two weeks. The education secretary told BBC Breakfast that remote learning would be ""mandatory"" from the week commencing 11 January for all secondary students, other than years 11 and 13 who would physically return to school on that date. As soon as news emerged of the new faster-spreading variant questions began to be asked about schools. An analysis by Public Health England released this week showed there was no evidence it was more able to infect children than other variants. But that does not mean infection rates have not been rising among children. As with all age groups, the proportion of school children testing positive increased during December - with more virus around, there was more transmission. Primary school children however still remain one of the age groups with the lowest infection rates, according to Public Health England analysis of people who test positive. This of course is likely to miss asymptomatic cases and random testing by the Office for National Statistics suggests infection levels could be higher. Regardless of this, the sheer scale of the infection levels in the worst-hit areas means ministers wanted to buy themselves time, hence some primaries will remain closed. If large numbers of pupils and staff need to isolate, it makes the smooth-running of schools impractical. Ministers are hoping mass testing coupled with the tougher restrictions - three-quarters of England are now in the highest tier - will be enough to curb infection levels and keep a lid on the spread in schools. But it is clear they will have to tread carefully to achieve that. Mr Williamson said more than 85% of primary schools were reopening on Monday and he wanted any closures to be ""short"". Meanwhile, council leaders said plans toclose primary schools in 22 London boroughs but not in 10 othershave ""no logic"". A Department for Education spokesperson said decisions on which areas were affected by the changes to school reopening plans were based on the number of new infections, positivity rates and pressures on the NHS.

Scotland has set arestart dateof 18 January for face-to-face learning with the majority being taught online from 11 January, while in Wales pupils aredue to return on a staggered basis.

"A rollout of the first approved vaccine - the Pfizer Covid-19 jab - is already under way Wales will get 22,000 doses next week of the second approved Covid vaccine, the Welsh Government has said. Dr Gillian Richardson, the doctor leading the rollout described getting theOxford-AstraZeneca vaccineto people across Wales as a ""huge task"". She originally said there would be 40,000 doses but the Welsh Government later    said it expected to reach that figure by the second week of January. Meanwhile Public Health Wales said 35,335 people had hadthe Pfizer jab. When asked how long the rollout of the latest vaccine would take, Dr Richardson toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfast: ""We can only give it at the rate at which it arrives, so some of that is not predictable with some of the international players in the vaccine manufacturing world but of course with Oxford we have a lot more control. ""So, by the time the Oxford-AstraZeneca is manufactured using a good steady flow, we'll be able to give you some of those predictions, but just now what we can say is we are doing those that are most vulnerable first, and we will get to everybody in their turn - please bear with us."" She also said it was ""excellent news"" the two doses could be administered up to 12 weeks apart, meaning more people could get their first jab sooner. She urged people to follow Wales' coronavirus restrictions as they celebrate new year: ""Please for everybody - take extra care. ""That'hands, face, space',externalmessage is really important, especially tonight, celebrate safely and enjoy yourself safely. ""It's going to be a while before we see vaccine turn the corner on those hospitalisations."" When will I get the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine? Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid vaccine clinics to be set up in Wales Covid vaccine: Older people's commissioner warns of 'confusion' Dr Helen Alefounder, a GP in Colwyn Bay, Conwy county, said she had not been told what date she would be administering the jab from, but planning was in full swing. Residents in Wales vaccinated by heath board, to 27 December 5,487Aneurin Bevan 4,604Betsi Cadwaladr 5,706Cardiff & Vale 4,789Cwm Taf Morgannwg 5,276 + 3,250Hywel Dda and Powys 5,285Swansea Bay She said: ""It's not just as simple as somebody turning up and having a vaccination, it's everything else that has to be considered with it. ""Logistically it's a huge, huge ask. ""However, we do it every year for flu, so we really have a good background knowledge of everything that we need to do and everything we need to provide. ""It's just simple things like making sure that there's places for people to park and making sure that you can maintain social distancing and making sure that you can allow people time to sit afterwards after their vaccine in case of reactions."" Health boards across Wales are warning that despite the hope offered by the Covid vaccines, hospitals are under relentless pressure in this latest wave of infections. On Thursday, Cardiff and Vale University Health Board announced it would cease all non-urgent surgery and outpatient appointments in January. It follows similar decisions to halt non-urgent treatment at theSwansea BayandAneurin Bevanhealth boards earlier in December. ""This is to redeploy staff in support of urgent and emergency care, including critical care,"" said Steve Curry, the chief operating officer of Cardiff and Vale. The board said it had also opened a new ""surge facility"" at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff. ""The additional Lakeside Wing bed capacity will be used to support demand in the coming weeks,"" added Mr Curry. The medical director at neighbouring Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board said all its sites ""remain under significant pressure with unprecedented demand"". ""This is extremely challenging for out staff,"" said Nick Lyons. ""We currently have more than 600 suspected, confirmed or recovering Covid-19 patients in our hospitals and ITUs across our sites are over capacity. The situation is extremely serious."" Royal Glamorgan Hospital consultant Dr Dai Samuel says the NHS in Wales is ""teetering on the brink"" Dr Dai Samuel, a consultant hepatologist at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital in Llantrisant, Rhondda Cynon Taf, has been working on Covid wards during the pandemic. He said the rollout of a second vaccine was good news, but urged people to still follow restrictions: ""The position with the vaccine is very good but we are in an acute situation. ""It's very difficult across the NHS. We are teetering on the brink. A few days of bad luck can bring us to our knees. It's very challenging. ""I just say [to people], carry on listening to what you have been told for months."" More than 35,000 people have now received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in Wales, including people such as healthcare workers who work in Wales but live over the border in England. Almost 13,000 of these vaccines were given in the past week. Plaid Cymru has called on the Welsh Government to ask the UK government to publish evidence to justify increasing the period between the two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine from 21 days to 12 weeks. In a letter to the Health Minister Vaughan Gething, the party's health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said the ""sudden switch"" represented ""a very significant departure"" from previous guidelines. He added there were ""very real concerns"" that a longer delay between doses ""could significantly decrease the effectiveness of the vaccine"". The Welsh Conservatives criticised the speed of the rollout. Health spokesman Andrew RT Davies said: ""Three weeks ago, the first Covid-19 vaccine was given in Wales, and since that time we have sadly seen confusion and hope drop away. ""Many people over 80 in Wales were desperately waiting for their appointment to do their bit and have the vaccine but as we quickly learnt they would have to wait longer,"" he said.

"There have been almost 200,000 Covid-19 cases in Wales since the start of the pandemic The number of deaths from coronavirus reported to Public Health Wales (PHW) has gone past 5,000. A further 12 people have died in Wales with Covid, taking the total to 5,001. Health Minister Vaughan Gething has apologised for ""every single life that has been lost"" during the pandemic. ""Today we reached a sobering milestone,"" said Dr Giri Shankar, Covid incident director for PHW. ""That's one life lost every 90 minutes since March last year. 5,000 families grieving."" It comes on the same day as it is confirmed thatmore than 600,000 people in Wales- 19.2% of the Welsh population - have had their first dose of the coronavirus vaccine. Your tributes to those lost to Covid in Wales Booster jab 'may be needed to tackle variants' Widow's plea to BAME communities to have vaccine The PHW reports deaths that are confirmed cases in hospitals and some care homes. The number who have died with Covid when the virus is either suspected or confirmed by doctors, in all settings, is nearly 6,500. ""I'm deeply sorry for every single life that's been lost. Every family that's been affected,"" said Mr Gething. He said those that died were not ""just numbers"", adding: ""These are people who are loved and valued and leave others behind."" He said there was no ""good"" or ""bad"" figure for the numbers of deaths from the pandemic. He added: ""I'm afraid we can be terribly confident that without the measures that we've all taken together, more people would have come to harm, and more families would be grieving the loss of a loved one."" Dr Shankar urged everyone ""whatever their background, socio-demographic and ethnicity"" to have the vaccine when offered it. Vaughan Gething says it's difficult to talk about ""good"" and ""bad"" death figures in this pandemic. Many people might question the latter point. It's true that counting Covid deaths is not straightforward. Different organisations use different measures and therefore produce different figures. But of today's tragic milestone, more than two-thirds of the 5,001 deaths have occurred since September. International comparisons are difficult too, but nevertheless Wales - and the rest of the UK - has one of the highest excess death tolls in the world. There will be a large variety of possible explanations for this, from investment in health systems, to the rapidity of test and trace and the timings of lockdowns. But with elections across Britain scheduled for May, a dispassionate excavation of the data and the impact of decision making by governments will likely have to wait for the public inquiry. The worst day for Covid deaths in Wales during the whole pandemic was in January - theworst week was also last month- and the highest 13 days of coronavirus deaths reported by PHW have all occurred since mid-December. Hospital admissions involving coronavirus and Covid patients in critical care were at record levels in January - but now they are at their lowest since 28 December, at 2,261 inpatients. Wales' case rate of 116 cases per 100,000 people is the lowest in the UK and the lowest since 6 October. Mr Gething denied the Welsh Government had been naive about the risks at the start of the pandemic. This video can not be played Wales' health minister says those who have died with Covid are not ""just numbers"" He said there were ""different risks to the UK and to Wales at that point in time"". But he added ministers had ""never said"" that if coronavirus ""arrived at our shores in larger numbers then there wouldn't be harm caused - far from it"". Mr Gething said preparations had changed as more information came to light and that the ""reasonable worst case scenario"" in their plans talked about hundreds of thousands of deaths across the UK and ""nearly 26,000 deaths in Wales"". Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? When, where and how will I get my Covid vaccine? Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales Mr Gething said he had warned ministers at the time that ""individual burial may no longer be possible"" but said ""we haven't reached that scenario in reality"". But he said those plans ""show how much worse this could have been"". Welsh Conservative leader in the Senedd Andrew RT Davies called the 5,000 deaths a ""grim milestone"", adding: ""We must never forget the impact on them and their loved ones."" He said the ""consistency around the messaging"" was something that he regretted and it wasn't ""clear and loud enough right the way through the pandemic"", with some confused by ""unnecessary divergences"" between governments. This video can not be played Watch how the Covid-19 map of Wales has changed as case rates have eased since Christmas Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said the Welsh Government should have gone into lockdown ""harder and earlier"" in March 2020. However he praised the government and all those involved in the vaccination programme for the ""fantastic"" improvement in the vaccination rate. The health minister acknowledged, in hindsight earlier this month, thatmore lives could have been saved had Wales gone into lockdown earlierat the start of the coronavirus pandemic. Office for National Statistics (ONS) figuresinclude all deaths registered, when the virus is suspected or confirmed- and in all settings from hospitals to people's homes. Public Health Wales figures just show hospital and care home deaths with Covid, when cases have been confirmed by a lab test. Under the ONS figures,Wales passed 5,000 deaths a month ago. It is estimated that for 90% of these deaths in Wales, Covid is the underlying cause not just a contributory factor. This video can not be played The different measures for looking at deaths involving Covid-19 in Wales The ONS death toll - up to 22 January - was 6,473, with updated figures due out on Tuesday. Of the deaths reported to Public Health Wales on Monday, four more were in the Betsi Cadwaladr health board area in north Wales, three were in Hywel Dda in west Wales, two each were in Cwm Taf Morgannwg and Aneurin Bevan in south Wales while one death was in Swansea Bay. There were also 610 new Covid infections reported in the last 24 hour period, taking the total number of cases to 196,670. More than 600,000 people have now received their first dose of the coronavirus vaccine in Wales - with 603,976 people now having had the jab. Of those, 2,792 have had a second dose. Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales How many people have been vaccinated in Wales? How many coronavirus cases in the UK? The case rate in Wales has fallen to 116 per 100,000 people, the lowest it has been for four months. Flintshire has overtaken its neighbouring county Wrexham as the area with the highest case rate with 231.9 per 100,000 people. Wrexham's rate now stands at 229.5. The areas with the lowest case rate are Ceredigion with 56.4 per 100,000 people, followed by Pembrokeshire with 69.9 and Swansea with 70. Since the start of the pandemic 1,559,030  people have been tested for Covid-19 in Wales, with more than 2.5 million tests carried out. On Sunday 11,013 new tests were performed.

The actions of the Ticketmaster employees in the case were condemned by Seth D DuCharme, acting US lawyer for New York's eastern district, and William F Sweeney Jr, assistant director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's New York Field Office. Live music gigs were a huge business before the coronavirus pandemic restricted them They said the employees ""repeatedly - and illegally - accessed a competitor's computers without authorisation using stolen passwords to unlawfully collect business intelligence"". ""Further, Ticketmaster's employees brazenly held a division-wide 'summit' at which the stolen passwords were used to access the victim company's computers, as if that were an appropriate business tactic,"" they added. They said the fine demonstrated that any company obtaining ""a competitor's confidential information for commercial advantage, without authority or permission, should expect to be held accountable in federal court"". The US justice department said the fine was part of a ""deferred prosecution agreement"" to resolve a case with five counts of ""computer intrusion and fraud offences"". It said that on 18 October, Ticketmaster's former head of artist services pleaded guilty in a ""related case to conspiring to commit computer intrusions and wire fraud, based on his participation in the same scheme"". Mr Sweeney added: ""When employees walk out of one company and into another, it's illegal for them to take proprietary information with them. Ticketmaster used stolen information to gain an advantage over its competition, and then promoted the employees who broke the law."" The deferred prosecution agreement means Ticketmaster has to pay the fine and then ""maintain a compliance and ethics programme"" designed to prevent and detect violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and other applicable laws. Ticketmaster also has to report annually to the US Attorney's Office during the three-year term of the agreement regarding these compliance measures. If it breaches the agreement, it will be ""subject to prosecution for the charges in the criminal information that was filed"" in the current case.

"Doctors are calling for a significant ramping up of the vaccination programme following approval of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. The first patients are expected to receive the jab - the second approved for use in the UK - on Monday. But with just over 500,000 doses available to use next week, experts are worried there may be a bottleneck in the system. There are more than 25m people in the nine priority groups identified so far. This includes all those over 50 and younger adults with health conditions, as well as frontline health and care staff. Oxford vaccine: How did they make it so fast? How do the vaccines compare? When will you be eligible for the Covid vaccine? Concern at 'unprecedented' English infection level Meanwhile, GPs have questioned the wisdom of cancelling patients already booked in for their second doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, the first jab that was approved and has been used since early December. As well as approving the Oxford vaccine on Wednesday, regulators also said that doctors could wait longer between the two courses needed, to ensure faster rollout of vaccination. But the British Medical Association's Dr Richard Vautrey said GPs were unhappy they were being asked to cancel appointments that had already been made for second doses. The original advice said they should be given three weeks apart. He said it was ""grossly unfair"" and would waste staff time. One of those who has been affected is Stella Joseph, who is 82 and has a chronic lung condition. ""The thing I feel most is utterly helpless, that there's nobody to appeal to, that you can't get any assistance with this at all. ""I think it is so hard that those of us who were in this first wave were obviously people who are at high risk and we're the ones who have been left high and dry."" The move has also prompted some debate about how strong the evidence is for delaying the second dose. Prof Peter Openshaw, of Imperial College London, said there was ""pretty convincing"" data showing it would enhance the effect of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. But he said because the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine had not been tested in the same way, there was no comparable evidence. So far nearly 950,000 people have received a first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. The hope was that when the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine was approved, it would lead to a significant increase in the rate of vaccination. The jab is easier to store and distribute as it can be kept at normal fridge temperature, unlike the Pfizer-BioNTech one that has to be kept in ultra-cold storage. There are thought to be more than five million doses of the Oxford vaccine in the UK, but only just over 500,000 are ready for use. That is because vaccines have to be put into vials and batched and certified. Sources at the NHS expressed frustration at the situation. ""The NHS is ready to go, but we can only go as quickly as supply allows,"" one said. Queen Mary University epidemiologist Deepti Gurdasani said there appeared to be a ""bottleneck"", and the government looked like it was still going to be under its target of two million doses a week. ""We really need to speed up rollout,"" she said. There are currently more than 700 vaccination sites up and running, with several hundred more thought to be ready to go once vaccines are available. But the limited supply of the Pfizer vaccine, which has to be shipped in from Belgium, has meant some centres have not been able to vaccinate people every week. Dame Clare Gerada, a former chair of the Royal College of GPs, said: ""We really now need a massive operational system. We need a 24/7 system with GPs, mass vaccination centres and hospitals - this needs to be scaled up. ""It's got to be football stadia, all these large venues that we've got currently lying dormant. ""If we can really get a mass operational system up and running, then I can't see why we can't be getting the whole population immunised by the spring."" NHS England's medical director for primary care, Dr Nikki Kanani, promised there would be a significant expansion of the vaccination programme in the coming weeks. She predicted the majority of care home residents would be protected by the end of January, and frontline staff would start to get a vaccination in large numbers. She also praised the progress made so far, thanking the ""tireless efforts of staff"". England Health Secretary Matt Hancock also praised staff, adding the numbers being vaccinated would ""rapidly increase in the months ahead"". Oxford vaccine: How did they make it so quickly?

"People spent less and saved more in 2020 as the pandemic led to shops, pubs and attractions being closed down. Consumer spending was down 7.1%, says Barclaycard, which tracks almost half of all credit and debit card spending. However spending on essential items climbed 4.1%, while independent businesses benefited as many more of us shopped locally. Meanwhile Brits working from home saved an average Â£110 a week, according to a separate survey from Aldermore Bank. ""2020 has accelerated many trends,"" said Raheel Ahmed, head of consumer products at Barclaycard. ""E-commerce has seen huge growth, working from home has meant many are shopping more locally and experiences within the home, such as virtual work-outs have become the norm."" The small shops in battle with the retail giants Hospitality worst-hit as unemployment rises again Online grocery shopping surged 70.3% over the year and looks set to have become the norm for many. The amount we spent on fuel fell by more than a fifth - 20.3% - as we made far fewer trips, and prices fell at the petrol pump. We also spent 15.6% less on clothing, presumably because many worked from home and there were no exciting events to go to that needed new outfits. Joh Rindom says there is a ""fashion for independents"" The Barclaycard data showed that we spent an extra 28.6% at independent food and drink shops, such as off-licences, butchers and bakeries, compared with a year earlier. It could be another trend that's here to stay as the card company's consumer confidence research showed that 57% of Brits wanted to increase their support of nearby businesses as a result of lockdown restrictions. Joh Rindom, who runs That Thing, an independent fashion, homeware and accessories shop, said perhaps because people have spent more time at home, perhaps because they've focused on what is important to them, this year there has been a ""fashion for independents"", she thinks. Support for florists bloomed during the year with purchases up 22.7% while spending on takeaways online surged 49.1%. But department stores were hard hit by the change in our spending habits, with spending down 17.2%, while clothing retailers experienced a 15.6% slump, leading to the financial problems at the likes of Debenhams and the Topshop owner, Arcadia. Brits' saving habits have been boosted by the change in lifestyle during the lockdown and pandemic changes. According to Aldermore Bank, weekly savings include Â£29 from not commuting, Â£20 on not spending as much on breakfasts and lunches, Â£22 on not socialising with work colleagues, Â£18 by avoiding takeaway coffees, and Â£22 on not going out on weekdays after work. ""The saving habits adopted due to the Covid-19 pandemic are likely to continue beyond this period and turn into better long-term spending routines,"" said Ewan Edwards, director of savings at Aldermore. ""One positive to take from 2020 is it has given some people the opportunity to reflect on how to improve their personal finances."" People who usually commute saved money Research by Moneysupermarket suggested that two-thirds of Brits saved an average of Â£586 per month in 2020 - equivalent to Â£7,032 over the course of the year. Londoners saved the most at Â£1,286 per month, followed by Yorkshire & the Humber who saved Â£690 and the East Midlands who saved Â£619. The Welsh saved the least at Â£302 per month. ""Some are saving more than ever as a result of no commuting fees, reduced childcare costs and far less going out for meals or day trips,"" said Sally Francis-Miles money spokesperson at MoneySuperMarket. ""This is especially evident in London where travel and childcare costs are often far higher."" But many have been hit hard and been unable to get into the savings habit in 2020. ""Money worries are a very real preoccupation for millions across the country,"" pointed out Ms Francis-Miles. ""Thousands have been made redundant or had their hours cut, they may be facing a struggle to cover the basics such as household bills and mortgage or rent payments.""

"Robin Masters says he was surprised to find a burger van ""in the middle of nowhere in a snowstorm"" on Tuesday Burger van owners can serve food to people breaking lockdown rules at beauty spots without themselves breaking regulations, a council says. Wales is at alert level four, meaning non-essential travel is banned and exercise must start and finish at home. One man spotted a burger van at a remote car park in the Brecon Beacons andposted it on Instagram,external. Powys Council said such businesses are classed as essential, although customers could be breaking the law. Dyfed-Powys officerscarried out ""high-visibility"" patrols on Wednesdayin a bid deter lockdown-defying visitors from descending on Wales' national parks. This video can not be played People travelling to the Brecon Beacons were turned away It came afterthe force turned away scores of people from the Brecon Beaconson Monday and Tuesday. North Wales Police said it was aware ""large numbers of people are visiting areas such as Snowdonia"". Despite these efforts to keep people away, self-catering vehicles such as burger vans are free to continue to operate. Asked by BBC Wales, a spokeswoman for Powys council said a ""mobile catering unit"" could legally operate at alert level four if they were only offering a takeaway service and with relevant permissions from the relevant national park and local authorities. She added: ""Therefore the owner of the unit would be allowed to travel to 'work', but those stopping to purchase refreshments could potentially be breaking the regulations if not travelling for one of these reasons. This would be a police matter."" Cars lined the A470 at Pen y Fan, in the Brecon Beacons, on Monday and Tuesday The peculiar situation emerged after Instagram user Robin Masters uploaded a snap of a burger van in a snow-covered car park on Tuesday. He wrote: ""Nice to see some snow today up the Brecon Beacons, crazy to find a burger van in the middle of nowhere in a snowstorm! Bit of a lifesaver though."" Brecon Beacons National Park Authority has been asked to comment. Dyfed-Powys Police urged people to make sure they are aware of and adhere to the lockdown rules in Wales. Covid: What are Wales' lockdown rules? Covid: What do the stats tell us? Covid: What's the advice on travelling over new year? In a statement, the force added it would only issue fines to those responsible for ""those blatant breaches where engagement fails"". Wales' three national parks issued a joint statement on Wednesday urging people to stay away. ""The time will come again when we can all enjoy the beauty and diversity of our parks, and we very much look forward to welcoming you back when that time is right and it is safe for you and safe for our communities,"" said Tegryn Jones, chief executive of Pembrokeshire Coast National Park Authority.

"Freight lorries arrive at Dover hours before the new rules start Boris Johnson has said the UK has ""freedom in our hands"" and must make the most of it as the country prepares to leave EU trading rules at 23:00 GMT. Historic changes to rules on travel, trade, immigration and security are to come into force as the UK enters a new era of relations with the continent. UK officials have insisted new border systems are ""ready to go"" amid concerns about possible delays at ports. The PM said the UK could now do ""things differently and if necessary better"". The trade deal agreed by the two sides on Christmas Eve, and passed by MPs on Wednesday, avoids the need for import taxes - tariffs - after the UK leaves the EU's internal market and customs union on 1 January. While fears of giant tailbacks of lorries at Dover have receded, uncertainty remains about new customs rules and the government has warned there will be ""some disruption"" in the coming days and weeks. Dover-Calais route 'will work well on 1 January' Gibraltar gets UK-Spain deal to keep open border A quick guide to what's in the Brexit deal Brexit: Seven things that will change To reduce the risk of delays, the UK is phasing in checks on goods entering the country from the continent over a six-month period up to July 2021. But some new customs procedures will come into force on the UK-side immediately from 11pm, such as on imports of alcohol, tobacco, chemicals and controlled drugs. EU member states are introducing full customs declarations and other controls on UK exports from 23:00. Among the other things that will change from 23:00 GMT: Free movement of people between the UK and EU countries will end - to be replaced in the UK by a""points-based"" immigration system,external Anyone from the UK who wants to stay in most of the EU for more than 90 days in any 180-day period will need a visa Duty-free shopping will return,,externalwith people coming back to the UK from the EU able to bring up to 42 litres of beer, 18 litres of wine, four litres of spirits and 200 cigarettes without paying tax EU citizens wanting to move to the UK (except those from the Irish Republic) will face the same points-based system as people elsewhere in the world UK police willlose instant access to EU-wide databaseson criminal records, fingerprints and wanted persons Traders in England, Scotland and Wales will have to complete more paperwork when dealing with EU countries Unlike the rest of the UK, Northern Ireland will continue to follow many of the EU's rules, as its border with the Republic of Ireland remains all but invisible. And the UK will gradually be able to keep more of the fish caught in its own waters, while the European Court of Justice will cease to have any role in deciding disputes between the UK and EU. If you are Boris Johnson this is huge, and exciting. If you are a business that's affected it might mean a big new opportunity, but it might also mean really big disruption and lots of extra hassle. The fact that there is a trade deal doesn't take all of the risk away. The treaty contains lots of uncertainty, not least for the biggest part of the economy: the service sector. Getting the agreement finalised in the time was a big achievement for both sides but there is a lot that it just doesn't cover that will, in time, have to be worked out somehow. Read Laura's blog Mr Johnson - who led the Leave campaign in the 2016 Brexit referendum and took the UK out of the EU in January six months after becoming prime minister, said the UK was on the verge of an ""amazing moment"". In his New Year message, the PM said he wanted the UK to be an ""open, generous and outward looking"" country that was a global leader in new technologies, fighting climate change and promoting free trade. ""We have our freedom in our hands and it is up to us to make the most of it."" And he urged the four nations of the United Kingdom to put the Brexit divisions of recent years behind them and focus on their common bonds. ""I think it will be the overwhelming instinct of the people of this country to come together as one United Kingdom - England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - working together to express our values around the world."" Intensive preparations have been taking place over the past two weeks to prepare the UK for the coming changes. The UK's Countdown Plan has involved operational testing of infrastructure at the border and close co-operation with France, Holland and Belgium. A government spokesman said: ""The border systems and infrastructure we need are in place, and we are ready for the UK's new start."" The UK Parliament was recalled to ratify the deal But concerns remain that many small businesses are not prepared for the changes and that with lorries without the correct paperwork set to be turned back at Dover and other ports, delays are inevitable. Traffic volumes are expected to be lower than normal on 1 January due to the pandemic but are expected to pick up from Monday, when the new procedures and the UK's contingency measures are expected to be tested. The government said450 ""Kent access"" permits had been issued to HGV lorries intendingto cross the channel at Dover on 1 January and hauliers arriving without them would be identified and subject to a Â£300 fine. One logistics firm told the BBC it would not send any trucks across until 10 Januarydue to congestion fears although Channel Tunnel Operator Getalink has said it expects the new systems to work smoothly. Brexit happened on 31 January 2020, but the UK has continued to follow Brussels' trade rules until now, while the deal was thrashed out. It completes the process set in motion in June 2016, when, in a referendum, UK voterschose by 52% to 48% to leave the EU. The free trade deal - agreed on Christmas Eve after nine months of negotiations - finallypassed into UK lawearly on Thursday morning - having also been backed by Brussels. This video can not be played Laura Kuenssberg challenges Boris Johnson on Brexit and vaccines But opponents say the country will still be worse off than it was while in the EU - and there is still uncertainty about what it will happen to banking and services, which are a major part of the UK economy. Meanwhile, the UK and Spain have reached agreementon a political framework for Gibraltar which will pave the way for a separate UK-EU treaty regarding the British overseas territory, which was not covered by the trade deal.

"People should take ""personal responsibility"" and stay at home this New Year's Eve to avoid spreading Covid-19, the health secretary says. With the NHS under increasing pressure, Matt Hancock said ""we cannot let up"". It comes as around 20 million more people in England entered the toughest level of restrictions at midnight. They join 24 million who were already living under tier four rules, which include a ""stay at home"" order and the closure of non-essential shops. In tier four areas, people are not allowed to mix with other households indoors or in most outdoor venues, although an individual can meet one other person in an open public space. Different households are also prohibited from mixing indoors in tiers two and three. The Isles of Scilly is the only area currently in tier one, where groups of up to six people are allowed to mix indoors and outdoors. The UK reported 55,892 new Covid cases on Thursday -the highest daily number of cases recorded yet. However, the infection rate during the first peak in spring is thought to have been higher than official figures suggested as testing was much more limited then. A further 964 deaths within 28 days of a positive test have also been recorded. Meanwhile, the start of the new school term in England has been delayed amid concerns about a fast-spreading new variant. Education Secretary Gavin Williamsonsaid he wanted school closures to be as ""short as possible"", after he announced primary pupils in the most at-risk areas of England will not return as planned on Monday. Secondary schools will also remain closed for an extra two weeks for most pupils, although Years 11 and 13 will return on 11 January. What are the lockdown and tier four rules? New coronavirus variant: What do we know? Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live A government advertising campaign to ""See in the new year safely at home"" is running throughout Thursday, urging people not to meet up with friends or family indoors, unless they are in the same household or bubble, and to avoid large gatherings. The adverts remind the public that about one in three people who have Covid-19 have no symptoms, so people should act like they have the virus to avoid spreading it without realising. Mr Hancock said: ""With our NHS under pressure we must all take personal responsibility this New Year's Eve and stay at home. ""I know how much we have all sacrificed this year and we cannot let up. Over 600,000 people have now been vaccinated and we are close to beating this virus. ""Now more than ever, we need to pull together to save lives and protect our NHS. If we continue to do our bit by staying at home, we can get through this together."" The Metropolitan Police issued a warning to potential revellers in London to ""celebrate the new year in the comfort of their own homes, not the homes of family and friends"". Commander Paul Brogden, who is leading this year's operation, said fines would be issued where necessary to any rule-breakers. In Brighton,people have been told not to attend a New Year's Eve party on the seafront, after a group called Protest Everywhere advertised a ""freedom protest street party"". Sussex Police said it would intervene to enforce restrictions on gatherings. While the changes to England's tier system came into force at 00:01 GMT on Thursday, Wales andNorthern Irelandremain in strict lockdown. The Welsh Ambulance Servicewarned ""no party is worth the risk"", with the health service under ""extreme pressure"". In Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has urged people not to celebrate Hogmanay in the traditional wayamid a lockdown across the mainland. The streets of Edinburgh will be empty for the first time in recent memory following the cancellation of its world famous street party, with only online events planned. Covid dampens New Year celebrations around world France plans mass New Year's Eve crackdown On Wednesday, Prof Stephen Powis, NHS England's national medical director, said it was ""vital"" people followed the guidance by staying at home and not mixing with other households. ""Covid loves a crowd, so please leave the parties for later in the year,"" he told a Downing Street press conference. Prime Minister Boris Johnson also urged people to follow the rules. ""That means not meeting up with friends or family indoors, unless they're in the same household or support bubble, and avoiding large gatherings of any kind,"" he said. This video can not be played 'Covid loves a crowd... so stay at home this New Year's Eve' says NHS boss Among the areas joining tier four are Lancashire, Birmingham and Black Country, Cumbria and the Isle of Wight. Liverpool City Region, Herefordshire, Cornwall, Dorset and Wiltshire are among those now in tier three. Alongside the changes to England's tier system, Wednesdayalso saw the approval of the Oxford-AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine, with vaccination centres starting to invite patients to receive the first of their two doses from next week.

"Scotland has been warned to bring in the new year at home, as events and socialising are banned this Hogmanay. The first minister, police chiefs and local council leaders have urged the public to welcome 2021 within their own household. Nicola Sturgeon told Scotland there should be ""no gatherings, no house parties and no first footing"". Police Scotland said people should ""do the right thing"" and reminded them that parties were not allowed. New Year's Eve looks very different this year, with a further 2,622 Covid cases recorded in the past 24 hours -the highest daily figureto be posted since mass testing in Scotland began. Nicola Sturgeon has appealed to the public to keep Hogmanay within the household There is no relaxing of the rules as there was for Christmas Day and all of mainland Scotland is in level four restrictions. The ""home of Hogmanay"" - Edinburgh - has only online events planned. 'Stay at home' Hogmanay plea as Covid cases surge New Covid strain 'becoming dominant' in Scotland Oxford vaccine roll out begins in Scotland on 4 January The Scottish government's messaging has asked the public to protect each other and the NHS by staying at home to suppress the virus. The first minister asked the nation to ""stick with it and keep looking after each other"" to ensure a safe start to 2021. During a statement to parliament she said everyone must remain vigilant during the difficult winter weeks ahead. She said: ""As this awful year draws to a close, let me again thank everyone across Scotland for your sacrifice and patience, and for looking out for each other. ""We have every reason to believe that the spring of 2021 will bring better times but we must first get through these difficult few weeks of winter. ""It is vital we keep doing everything we can to suppress this virus to keep ourselves and our loved ones safe and to protect the NHS."" She said people should mark the new year responsibly and in line with current restrictions. ""To be clear, that means no gatherings, no house parties, and no first footing"", she said. ""Instead, we should bring in 2021 in our own homes with just our own household. ""We know our prospects for the rest of the year will be better if we get off to a safe start so let's stick with it, and keep looking after each other. ""And let me wish everyone when it comes a better, brighter and happier new year."" Police Scotland said its approach, as it has been throughout the pandemic, would be to engage with the public, explain the legislation and guidance, and encourage compliance. But the force said it would not hesitate to continue to use enforcement powers as a last resort. Deputy Chief Constable Malcolm Graham said: ""We're asking everyone to continue to do the right thing to stop the spread of this virus and protect public health as it is clear that there is an ongoing risk. ""Remember that parties and indoor gatherings of different households are not permitted and we will continue to use our enforcement powers to disperse large groups of people where necessary. ""Please follow the Scottish government's advice, which is to celebrate Hogmanay and the New Year with your own household only, in your own home."" There will be no street party this year after Edinburgh moved its events online The streets of Edinburgh will be empty for the first time in recent memory following the cancellation of the world famous street party, and the celebration has moved entirely online. Council Leader Adam McVey said: ""The best and safest place to celebrate Hogmanay this year is at home. ""Cases have increased significantly so please don't go round to friends' houses and keep adhering to the guidance - more gatherings at Hogmanay will cause increased risk to people across the capital and, in particular, our NHS staff and services. ""Following the rules now is the quickest way to get restrictions lifted and hopefully we can look back at this Hogmanay as one of our final sacrifices in the battle against the virus. ""As 2020 comes to a close and with the roll out of vaccines under way, we can look more positively towards 2021. But for now, and this Hogmanay, please keep following the guidance, please stay at home and keep yourself and others safe."" LEVELS:What are the restrictions in your area?

"Tesco, Pizza Hut and Superdrug are among more than a hundred firms ""named and shamed"" by the government for not paying workers the minimum wage. Almost 140 companies,externalinvestigated between 2016 and 2018 failed to pay Â£6.7m to more than 95,000 workers. The minimum wage ranges from Â£4.15 an hour for apprentices, to Â£8.72 an hour for over-25s. Tesco, Pizza Hut and Superdrug said the underpayments were historic errors and staff had been swiftly reimbursed. The city with the world's highest minimum wage Workers 'sleeping on mattresses' inside factory 'I worked a five-hour shift and got paid nothing' Ministers said the offending firms -which included hotels, restaurants, car washes and shops,external- short changed tens of thousands of workers, in what they described as a ""completely unacceptable breach of employment law"". Cases included employers taking deductions from wages for uniforms, training or parking fees or failing to raise employees' pay after a birthday which should have moved them into a higher minimum wage bracket. It is the first time the government has named firms for failing to pay the national minimum wage since 2018, following reforms to the process to make sure only the worst offenders are revealed. The Business Minister Paul Scully said he was especially disappointed to see big household names on the list but he said it should be a ""wake-up call"" to bosses. ""It is never acceptable for any employer to short-change their workers, but it is especially disappointing to see huge household names who absolutely should know better on this list,"" he added. The UK national minimum wage sets out the least a worker can be paid per hour by law. As of April 2020, it stood at Â£8.72 an hour for people aged 25 and older - the government refers to this main rate as the National Living Wage. There are four minimum wages below this amount for younger workers and apprentices: The National Minimum Wage for 21 to 24-year-olds - Â£8.20 For 18 to 20-year-olds - Â£6.45 For under-18s - Â£4.55 For apprentices - Â£4.15 TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said many firms which failed to pay their workers the minimum wage still wouldn't be named. ""The government raised the threshold for naming employers compared with the old scheme, meaning fewer bad bosses are exposed."" Tesco said a technical issue in 2017 meant some workers' pay ""inadvertently"" fell below the minimum wage and it had reported the issue itself to HMRC. ""In most cases the reimbursement was Â£10 or less,"" the supermarket said. Pizza Hut and Superdrug both said the error was related to a previous uniform policy, which required staff to wear a particular colour trousers and shoes. ""It is important to stress that there was never any intent to underpay our employees,"" said Pizza Hut. Superdrug said it had changed its policy to make sure the issue did not happen again.

"Sir Keir Starmer has predicted the UK's ""best years are still to come"", as he delivered his first New Year message as Labour leader. He said he would fight for ""prosperity, fairness and opportunity"" as the country ""rebuilds"" following Covid. Twenty million more people in England have entered the toughest - tier four - coronavirus restrictions, amid a surge in infections. But the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine has been given the go-ahead for next week. There will be 530,000 doses available from Monday, on top of the Pfizer-BioNTech jabs whichbegan earlier this month. A further 50,023 new Covid cases were recorded in the UK on Wednesday, as well as 981 more deaths within 28 days of a positive test - more than double the previous day's total. Twenty million in England added to top Covid tier Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine approved for use in UK In his message, Sir Keir said the UK - which has seen an8% contraction in gross domestic product (GDP),externalsince January - had suffered more than any other major economy during the pandemic, but vaccines would eventually improve the situation. He added: ""Until then, it is all of our duty to stay safe, to look after neighbours, keep up the national effort that has got us this far. ""Because when this crisis ends, and it will end, we will rebuild our country, together."" At a Downing Street press conference on Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the government would ""shift heaven and earth"" to vaccinate people as quickly as possible. But, with the new strain of coronavirus spreading, it was important to ""redouble our efforts"" to prevent this, he added. The prime minister traditionally releases a New Year's message to the nation on 31 December. On Wednesday, Sir Keir - Labour leader since April - ordered his MPs to back the government's post-Brexit trade deal with the EU, arguing that to do otherwise would raise the chances of no deal, which he said would damage the economy even more than the PM's ""thin"" agreement. ""The United Kingdom is forging a new path in the world,"" he said in his message. ""And the Labour Party that I lead will focus on ensuring that path leads to greater prosperity, fairness and opportunity for every nation and region, every village, every town and city that makes up our great United Kingdom. ""I believe this can once again be the best country to grow up in and the best country to grow old in. ""And with that hope and that vision, I believe that our best years are still to come."" Three members of Labour's shadow ministerial teamresigned on Wednesdayrather than vote for the government's deal, which the House of Commonspassed by a majority of 448.

"The city saw anti-lockdown protests before Christmas People tempted to attend a New Year's Eve party on Brighton seafront have been warned by police to stay away. A group called Protest Everywhere has advertised the ""freedom protest street party"" and asked people ""to bring a bottle, drums, music, firewood, love and joy"". Independent councillor Nichole Brennan said it was ""madness"" and Sussex Police said Covid rules would be enforced. The BBC has been unable to contact the organisers. The event comes after anti-lockdown protests were held in the city in the run-up to Christmas. Sussex joined other areas of the country intier four on Boxing Day, placing it in thehighest level of restrictionsunder which people can meet one other person from another household, if both are alone in an open public space. The restrictions came in amid rising infection rates and the fast spread of thenew virus variant. After the event was advertised, Ms Brennan said: ""I don't think now many people will actually attend and I do believe that the police will take this incident very, very seriously, not because they want to be authoritarian - they want to keep our city and our NHS safe."" She urged people to think long and hard and she asked: ""Is it really worth the risk?"" TESTING:How do I get a virus test? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters SCHOOLS:What will happen if children catch coronavirus? A Sussex Police spokeswoman said: ""We are aware of an event in Brighton planned for New Year's Eve and are engaging with the organisers. ""Gatherings of more than two people from different households outside are not allowed under current tier 4 restrictions - these have been imposed to curb infection rates of the new more transmissible variant of the virus. ""We will continue policing the restrictions. Where there are blatant breaches and flouting of these regulations then we will intervene, we will be robust and we will take enforcement. ""We recognise this is a difficult time, but urge everyone to work with us and help save lives.""

"This video can not be played Laura Kuenssberg challenges Boris Johnson on Brexit and vaccines The post-Brexit trade deal between the UK and EU takes effect at 23:00 GMT on Thursday, after it was signed into law. Parliament overwhelmingly backed the agreement in a high-speed process on Wednesday, following the two sides reaching agreement on Christmas Eve. The UK leaves the EU's single market and customs union, but the deal ends the possibility of tariffs on goods. PM Boris Johnson thanked MPs and said: ""The destiny of this great country now resides firmly in our hands."" But opponents say the country will still be worse off than it was while in the EU. Brexit happened on 31 January, but the UK has continued to follow Brussels' trade rules until now. MPs overwhelmingly back post-Brexit deal with EU A quick guide to what's in the Brexit deal The deal - reached just before the deadline to do so - sets out a new business and security relationship, following the severing of these ties. It comes four-and-a-half years after the UK voted to leave the EU in a referendum. A Brexit deal has been agreed, days before a deadline.It means that the UK and the EU can continue to trade without extra taxes being put on goods. What took so long?The UK voted to leave the EU in 2016 and actually left on 31 January 2020, but leaders had until the end of 2020 to work out a trade deal. There are big changes ahead.Although it's a trade deal that has been agreed, there will also be changes to how people travel between the EU and UK, and to the way they live and work. TheEU (Future Relationship) Bill,,externalbringing the trade deal into UK law, was backed in the House of Commons by 521 to 73 votes on Wednesday, after Parliament was recalled from its Christmas break. The House of Lords later passed it at third reading - its final stage - without a vote and the Queen - who is spending the festive period at Windsor Castle rather than Sandringham because of the coronavirus pandemic - gave the final approval, Royal Assent. Inan interview with the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg, the prime minister said the deal would allow the UK to ""go our own way but also have free trade"" with the EU. Most Labour MPs voted in favour after leader Sir Keir Starmer said a ""thin deal was better than no deal"". But all other opposition parties, including the SNP, the Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru andall Northern Ireland partiesthat take seats at Westminster, opposed the bill. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Charles Michel signed the deal earlier on Wednesday in Brussels. It will come into force at 23:00 on Thursday, but although the European Parliament has begun its scrutiny of the 1,246-page document, it will not get a chance to ratify it formally until early in the new year. The deal has, however, been given the unanimous backing of ambassadors from the 27 nations and the member states gave their written approval on Tuesday.

"People should take ""personal responsibility"" and stay at home this New Year's Eve to avoid spreading Covid-19, the health secretary says. With the NHS under increasing pressure, Matt Hancock said ""we cannot let up"". It comes as around 20 million more people in England entered the toughest level of restrictions at midnight. They join 24 million who were already living under tier four rules, which include a ""stay at home"" order and the closure of non-essential shops. In tier four areas, people are not allowed to mix with other households indoors or in most outdoor venues, although an individual can meet one other person in an open public space. Different households are also prohibited from mixing indoors in tiers two and three. The Isles of Scilly is the only area currently in tier one, where groups of up to six people are allowed to mix indoors and outdoors. The UK reported 55,892 new Covid cases on Thursday -the highest daily number of cases recorded yet. However, the infection rate during the first peak in spring is thought to have been higher than official figures suggested as testing was much more limited then. A further 964 deaths within 28 days of a positive test have also been recorded. Meanwhile, the start of the new school term in England has been delayed amid concerns about a fast-spreading new variant. Education Secretary Gavin Williamsonsaid he wanted school closures to be as ""short as possible"", after he announced primary pupils in the most at-risk areas of England will not return as planned on Monday. Secondary schools will also remain closed for an extra two weeks for most pupils, although Years 11 and 13 will return on 11 January. What are the lockdown and tier four rules? New coronavirus variant: What do we know? Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live A government advertising campaign to ""See in the new year safely at home"" is running throughout Thursday, urging people not to meet up with friends or family indoors, unless they are in the same household or bubble, and to avoid large gatherings. The adverts remind the public that about one in three people who have Covid-19 have no symptoms, so people should act like they have the virus to avoid spreading it without realising. Mr Hancock said: ""With our NHS under pressure we must all take personal responsibility this New Year's Eve and stay at home. ""I know how much we have all sacrificed this year and we cannot let up. Over 600,000 people have now been vaccinated and we are close to beating this virus. ""Now more than ever, we need to pull together to save lives and protect our NHS. If we continue to do our bit by staying at home, we can get through this together."" The Metropolitan Police issued a warning to potential revellers in London to ""celebrate the new year in the comfort of their own homes, not the homes of family and friends"". Commander Paul Brogden, who is leading this year's operation, said fines would be issued where necessary to any rule-breakers. In Brighton,people have been told not to attend a New Year's Eve party on the seafront, after a group called Protest Everywhere advertised a ""freedom protest street party"". Sussex Police said it would intervene to enforce restrictions on gatherings. While the changes to England's tier system came into force at 00:01 GMT on Thursday, Wales andNorthern Irelandremain in strict lockdown. The Welsh Ambulance Servicewarned ""no party is worth the risk"", with the health service under ""extreme pressure"". In Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has urged people not to celebrate Hogmanay in the traditional wayamid a lockdown across the mainland. The streets of Edinburgh will be empty for the first time in recent memory following the cancellation of its world famous street party, with only online events planned. Covid dampens New Year celebrations around world France plans mass New Year's Eve crackdown On Wednesday, Prof Stephen Powis, NHS England's national medical director, said it was ""vital"" people followed the guidance by staying at home and not mixing with other households. ""Covid loves a crowd, so please leave the parties for later in the year,"" he told a Downing Street press conference. Prime Minister Boris Johnson also urged people to follow the rules. ""That means not meeting up with friends or family indoors, unless they're in the same household or support bubble, and avoiding large gatherings of any kind,"" he said. This video can not be played 'Covid loves a crowd... so stay at home this New Year's Eve' says NHS boss Among the areas joining tier four are Lancashire, Birmingham and Black Country, Cumbria and the Isle of Wight. Liverpool City Region, Herefordshire, Cornwall, Dorset and Wiltshire are among those now in tier three. Alongside the changes to England's tier system, Wednesdayalso saw the approval of the Oxford-AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine, with vaccination centres starting to invite patients to receive the first of their two doses from next week.

"France is mobilising 100,000 police and gendarmes on New Year's Eve to break up parties and enforce a curfew imposed to combat coronavirus. The extra security also aims at halting the torching of cars that often takes place on the final night of the year. France has confirmed 2.6m Covid-19 cases, the fifth highest total in the world, and more than 64,000 deaths. Like other European countries, France will see muted celebrations for New Year's Eve amid the pandemic. In her New Year address, German Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke emotionally about the pandemic which had ""imposed a lot on everyone, and too much on some"" in 2020. She reached out to those who had lost loved ones to Covid-19, and she attacked coronavirus conspiracy theories, ""which are not just false and dangerous, but also cynical and cruel towards those people"". French Interior Minister GÃ©rald Darmanin has ordered a visible security presence in city centres and flashpoint suburbs from 20:00 (19:00 GMT), when the curfew begins. In Paris half of the metro lines will be closed in the evening, while Mr Darmanin also asked for a wider public transport shutdown across the country to be considered. Despite rising cases,and concerns over a new more contagious strain of the disease,a government spokesman said there was no need for local lockdowns for now. France has had two national lockdowns and bars, restaurants and cultural attractions will remain closed into January. Mr Darmanin has written to regional leaders informing them of Thursday's ""exceptional"" mobilisation of 100,000 police and gendarmes. Officers will be instructed to break up underground parties as soon as they are reported, fine participants and identify the organisers. Patrols meanwhile are to carry out ""appropriate identity checks"" and search vehicles. Only half of metro lines in Paris will run on New Year's Eve Mr Darmanin also urged shops to limit or stop the sale of flammable liquids in portable containers and takeaway alcoholic drinks. He has also suggested that local authorities do not publicise incidents of cars set alight, to ""avoid any incidence of 'competition'"" between different areas. Car burning has effectively become an annual event in French suburbs since riots in 2005 in Paris and elsewhere. Last year a record 1,457 cars were torched across France on New Year's Eve, according to media reports. The previous year's figure was 1,290. Inthe UK, a further 20 million people in Englandwere placed into the toughest tier of restrictions from Thursday.

"Teachers and unions have criticised the government's last-minute move to delay the start of term for all secondary schools and some primaries in England. Vice president of the ASCL headteacher's union Pepe Di'Iasio said ministers should have decided earlier. ""We've all seen this coming, and we would have preferred to have been able to plan for this before the end of last term,"" he told BBC News. There is also concern over how areas have been chosen for primary closures. On Wednesday, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said some primary schools in Covid hot spots would remain closed - this equates to about 15% of primary schools. But there would be a review of these every two weeks, the Department for Education said, in the same way that local tier restrictions are reviewed. Meanwhile, Year 11 and Year 13 pupils are now due to return to face-to-face lessons on 11 January - a week later than planned - with others returning on 18 January. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, called on ministers to explain its decisions on which primary schools will re-open. He labelled the government's strategy as little more than ""keep calm and carry on"". ""There is obviously a huge amount of concern over how it can be safe for schools in some tier four areas to open,"" he said, ""while schools in other tier four areas are being told to move to remote learning. ""In some instances that means different approaches for schools only a few roads away from each other,"" he added. A Department for Education spokesman added some detail, saying: ""Decisions on which areas will be subject to the contingency framework are based on close work with PHE, the NHS, the Joint Biosecurity Centre, and across government to monitor the number of new infections, positivity rates, and pressures on the NHS. ""These measures will be reviewed every two weeks, and we hope they will be in place for the shortest period possible."" TESTING:How do I get a virus test? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters SCHOOLS:What will happen if children catch coronavirus? In December - on the last day of the Christmas term for many - the government asked schools to start setting up mass testing programmes for January. But heads and teachers said the timescale was not workable, as they would be setting up online learning for the majority of pupils in the first week of term as well. The delay to the start of term offers schools an extra week to get their mini test and trace systems up and running. There had been growing pressure for earlier school shutdowns as virus cases soared in many areas, including parts of London and south-east England, and as attendance figures dropped dramatically. Mr Di'Iasio said: ""I think everyone in the country has known that there's going to be a surge and a peak, particularly in January."" An earlier decision would have meant that teachers could have made preparations in time for children to go back as normal, he said. Parent, Chihera Mai Shingi, agreed with the decision, posting on the BBC News Family and Education Facebook page: ""We got Covid from our Year 7 daughter. Schools should be closed."" But Charlotte Elizabeth Hayward expressed her concerns about schools carrying out the testing: ""Space? Staff? Resources (financial and otherwise). ""It's not just a quick set up. We have 1,600 kids and around 200 staff. All on an already fit to burst site. The man does not have a clue."" Chairman of the Commons Education Select Committee Robert Halfon said teachers and support staff should be made a priority for vaccinations. ""If we can make sure that they are vaccinated and they are safe, it's less likely that schools will have to close, and this two weeks has to mean two weeks. ""Schools just can't be a revolving door that never stands still, open one day, shut the next."" Joint general secretary of the National Education Union, Dr Mary Bousted, said she was astonished that any pupils were going back at all before 18 January. ""A longer period of online working for all primary, secondary and college students could suppress virus levels and buy time both for the roll out of the vaccine and to put in place measures that can keep schools safer."" She added: ""We would like Gavin Williamson to explain, if schools are not centres of transmission, why school age pupils are now the most infected age groups?"" Richard Sheriff, executive head teacher of Harrogate Grammar School, said regular testing could be key to minimising classroom disruptions but criticised the government for announcing the plans just days before the Christmas break. ""Testing and the delayed return is a realisticÂ program, but it still puts a huge amountÂ of pressure on schools,"" he said. ""We need reassurances in the physical arrangements for testing, including extra space and support on the ground to make it happen."" The government says schools are being supported financially to set up testing and argued that they are only being closed as a ""last resort"" because of the rising number of cases.

"Schools will accommodate vulnerable children and the children of key workers from the start of term Most pupils in Northern Ireland will not be returning to school in the first week of January as planned. Primary school pupils will be taught remotely until 11 January, after which they will return to the classroom. For some post-primary pupils (Years 8-11), online learning will be in place for the entire month of January. Childcare settings including those attached to schools, pre-school facilities, nurseries and special schools will be open as usual. Schools will accommodate vulnerable children and the children of key workers from the start of term. Exams due to take place in January will still go ahead in line with public health guidance Education Minister Peter Weir said the action was in response to the level of Covid-19 transmission and high case numbers. On Wednesday, Northern Ireland reported arecord 2,143 cases in a 24-hour period. For post-primary pupils in Years 12 to 14 - the GCSE and A-level years - they will return to school after the first week of January. Exams due to take place in January will still go ahead in line with public health guidance, and schools will have flexibility to give face-to-face teaching to students sitting exams. Youth Service provision, which focuses on the social and development needs of young people, will be stood down until the end of January, with targeted services moving online. The decision on schools comes after discussions between the Department of Education, Department of Health, Education Authority and the Public Health Agency. Mr Weir said he had consulted the chief scientific officer and the chief medical officer, and the move was in response to ""unprecedented levels of positive Covid-19 tests since Christmas"". ""I must stress that these decisions are not made lightly as I know the negative impact on children's learning and mental health and well-being of not being in school,"" he added. The Irish National Teachers' Organisation said delaying the return of schools was the ""right decision"" Mr Weir previously said schools would reopen in the first week of January. Speaking to BBC's Good Morning Ulster on Thursday, he said decision making had remained consistent with scientific advice throughout the pandemic. ""Whenever announcements were made a couple of weeks ago, they were completely compatible with the advice we were getting from the experts,"" he said. Martine Mulhern, principal of St Cecilia's College in Londonderry, welcomed the decision from the education minister but said it should have been taken before the Christmas break. Speaking to BBC Radio Foyle, Mrs Mulhern said: ""We could have had the children prepared for what was to come and I think it was an opportunity missed."" Mrs Mulhern said key worker parents must be made aware that their children can come to school. ""We want to ensure sure those children can still come to school so those individuals can still do the invaluable work to keep us all safe,"" she added. Lori Campbell, who is a mum of four from Derry, has said she is not happy that her children will not be returning to school as planned. ""I have four children here at home and they each attend three different schools at four different levels of their education. ""Not attending school has impacted them greatly, not only in their learning but also in their social and emotional wellbeing,"" she said. Mrs Campbell, who works as a child minder, has said her previous experience of remote learning impacted her as a parent as she works predominately from home. ""I have to juggle being a step-in school teacher with my children who are still in primary school, as well as the needs of children I look after when I am working."" She added: ""I am sitting here, like many other people on New Year's Eve having had a plan for Monday morning for my children to go back to school, a plan for my working week and that plan has just been torn to shreds."" Gerry Murphy, northern secretary for the Irish National Teachers' Organisation, said it was the ""right decision"" and it would give ""the entire system a chance to wait for a safer return"". However, he added the decision was ""entirely foreseeable"" and the minister could have ""announced it last week in the assembly"". Sinn FÃ©in assembly member John O'Dowd, who is a former education minister, also said it was a ""belated announcement"". ""It does reflect how serious the situation is in regards to our public health and the pressure that is currently on our hospitals. ""I'm a parent and I am also a legislator, and I believe the best place for our children is in schools but only if it is safe to do so. ""It is currently not safe to do that."" Chris Lyttle, chair of the NI Assembly's education committee, acknowledged the minister had a ""extremely difficult challenge"" but ""we really need more timely decisions to avoid this type of distressing situation"".

"France is mobilising 100,000 police and gendarmes on New Year's Eve to break up parties and enforce a curfew imposed to combat coronavirus. The extra security also aims at halting the torching of cars that often takes place on the final night of the year. France has confirmed 2.6m Covid-19 cases, the fifth highest total in the world, and more than 64,000 deaths. Like other European countries, France will see muted celebrations for New Year's Eve amid the pandemic. In her New Year address, German Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke emotionally about the pandemic which had ""imposed a lot on everyone, and too much on some"" in 2020. She reached out to those who had lost loved ones to Covid-19, and she attacked coronavirus conspiracy theories, ""which are not just false and dangerous, but also cynical and cruel towards those people"". French Interior Minister GÃ©rald Darmanin has ordered a visible security presence in city centres and flashpoint suburbs from 20:00 (19:00 GMT), when the curfew begins. In Paris half of the metro lines will be closed in the evening, while Mr Darmanin also asked for a wider public transport shutdown across the country to be considered. Despite rising cases,and concerns over a new more contagious strain of the disease,a government spokesman said there was no need for local lockdowns for now. France has had two national lockdowns and bars, restaurants and cultural attractions will remain closed into January. Mr Darmanin has written to regional leaders informing them of Thursday's ""exceptional"" mobilisation of 100,000 police and gendarmes. Officers will be instructed to break up underground parties as soon as they are reported, fine participants and identify the organisers. Patrols meanwhile are to carry out ""appropriate identity checks"" and search vehicles. Only half of metro lines in Paris will run on New Year's Eve Mr Darmanin also urged shops to limit or stop the sale of flammable liquids in portable containers and takeaway alcoholic drinks. He has also suggested that local authorities do not publicise incidents of cars set alight, to ""avoid any incidence of 'competition'"" between different areas. Car burning has effectively become an annual event in French suburbs since riots in 2005 in Paris and elsewhere. Last year a record 1,457 cars were torched across France on New Year's Eve, according to media reports. The previous year's figure was 1,290. Inthe UK, a further 20 million people in Englandwere placed into the toughest tier of restrictions from Thursday. ""I must ask you to follow the rules where you live tomorrow night and see in the new year safely at home,"" Prime Minister Boris Johnson said during a press conference. This video can not be played The prime minister says he's confident the UK's Covid situation will be ""very much better"" by 5 April The whole of mainlandScotlandhas been under level four - the top tier of measures - since 26 December and will remain there for at least three weeks. People have been urged to remain at home on New Year's Eve. InItaly, a 10pm curfew has been imposed, and bars, restaurants and most shops are closed. The country is under nationwide lockdown until 7 January. Meanwhile Pope Francis will not lead New Year's Eve and New Year's Day services in theVatican, after suffering a recurrence of chronic hip pain. Irelandwill move to its highest level of restrictions on Thursday, banning all household visits, closing all non-essential retail and limiting travel to 5km. Germanyis currently under lockdown until 10 January. The government has banned the sale of fireworks and put in place tight restrictions on the number of people who can gather in public. Health Minister Jens Spahn said he expects the country to have the ""quietest New Year's Eve"" in living memory.,external The Netherlandsis under a lockdown set to last until 19 January.

"This video can not be played Professor Hugh Montgomery says hospitals are facing a ""tsunami"" of Covid cases. People who do not follow social distancing rules or wear masks ""have blood on their hands"", an intensive care doctor has warned. Prof Hugh Montgomery told BBC Radio 5 Live hospitals were facing a ""tsunami"" of Covid cases and he feared it would get worse after New Year's Eve. He urged people to accept that it was going to be a ""miserable"" occasion this year and not to gather in groups. It echoes official advice to stay at home and not hold parties. About 44 million people in England are now living under the toughest level of Covid restrictions after tier four was expanded at midnight. Coronavirus: What are the rules for face masks or face coverings? Millions told to remain at home on New Year's Eve Which areas are going into tier four and what are the rules? Five ways to avoid catching coronavirus indoors Aged 22, 7 months pregnant and in Covid intensive care A further 50,023 new Covid cases were recorded in the UK on Wednesday, as well as 981 more deaths within 28 days of a positive test - more than double the previous day's total. Prof Montgomery, who works in intensive care at London's Whittington Hospital, and leads a research group at UCL, said: ""We are in a lot of trouble in UK intensive care now. ""Just huge numbers coming in, my heart goes out as well to our emergency departments, seeing a tsunami in the last week or two of cases. Everyone is working at maximum stretch."" He told Radio 5's Rachel Burden it was wrong to blame the surge in cases and deaths on the new variant of coronavirus, which was only ""slightly"" more transmissible and caused the same symptoms. ""It is making me actually very angry now that people are laying the blame on the virus, and it is not the virus, it is people, people are not washing their hands, they are not wearing their masks,"" he said. And he warned anyone not social distancing or following the rules that they ""have blood on their hands"". ""They are spreading this virus. Other people will spread it and people will die. They won't know they have killed people but they have."" He added: ""I am watching whole families getting wiped out here, and it's got to stop."" Prof Montgomery, who was on shift as he gave the interview to 5 Live, said it was ""a great myth"" that hospitals are being overwhelmed with elderly people. ""The people we are getting are, like the first wave, my age really. I am 58 and I would say half the patients are younger than me. It is middle-aged people or a little bit older that we are getting."" He also told how he had gone home for a shower after one of his shifts and been called back because a pregnant patient had deteriorated. And he issued a plea to people thinking of seeing in the New Year later with a party: ""I am really sorry this New Year is going to be miserable, but it has to be. Please don't gather in masses. Don't make this a last swansong."" Prof Montgomery's warnings echo advice from NHS England's Prof Stephen Powis, who told a Downing Street press conference on Wednesday: ""Covid loves a crowd, so please leave the parties for later in the year."" And in Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has already warned people not to celebrate Hogmanay in the traditional wayamid a lockdown across the mainland.

"This video can not be played Laura Kuenssberg challenges Boris Johnson on Brexit and vaccines The post-Brexit trade deal between the UK and EU takes effect at 23:00 GMT on Thursday, after it was signed into law. Parliament overwhelmingly backed the agreement in a high-speed process on Wednesday, following the two sides reaching agreement on Christmas Eve. The UK leaves the EU's single market and customs union, but the deal ends the possibility of tariffs on goods. PM Boris Johnson thanked MPs and said: ""The destiny of this great country now resides firmly in our hands."" But opponents say the country will still be worse off than it was while in the EU. Brexit happened on 31 January, but the UK has continued to follow Brussels' trade rules until now. MPs overwhelmingly back post-Brexit deal with EU A quick guide to what's in the Brexit deal The deal - reached just before the deadline to do so - sets out a new business and security relationship, following the severing of these ties. It comes four-and-a-half years after the UK voted to leave the EU in a referendum. A Brexit deal has been agreed, days before a deadline.It means that the UK and the EU can continue to trade without extra taxes being put on goods. What took so long?The UK voted to leave the EU in 2016 and actually left on 31 January 2020, but leaders had until the end of 2020 to work out a trade deal. There are big changes ahead.Although it's a trade deal that has been agreed, there will also be changes to how people travel between the EU and UK, and to the way they live and work. TheEU (Future Relationship) Bill,,externalbringing the trade deal into UK law, was backed in the House of Commons by 521 to 73 votes on Wednesday, after Parliament was recalled from its Christmas break. The House of Lords later passed it at third reading - its final stage - without a vote and the Queen - who is spending the festive period at Windsor Castle rather than Sandringham because of the coronavirus pandemic - gave the final approval, Royal Assent. Inan interview with the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg, the prime minister said the deal would allow the UK to ""go our own way but also have free trade"" with the EU. Most Labour MPs voted in favour after leader Sir Keir Starmer said a ""thin deal was better than no deal"". But all other opposition parties, including the SNP, the Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru andall Northern Ireland partiesthat take seats at Westminster, opposed the bill. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Charles Michel signed the deal earlier on Wednesday in Brussels. It will come into force at 23:00 on Thursday, but although the European Parliament has begun its scrutiny of the 1,246-page document, it will not get a chance to ratify it formally until early in the new year. The deal has, however, been given the unanimous backing of ambassadors from the 27 nations and the member states gave their written approval on Tuesday.

The Road Haulage Association (RHA) has also warned that ""customs formalities"" and regulatory checks mean that there are likely to be ""teething problems"" as the new arrangements are brought in. A Brexit deal has been agreed, days before a deadline.It means that the UK and the EU can continue to trade without extra taxes being put on goods. What took so long?The UK voted to leave the EU in 2016 and actually left on 31 January 2020, but leaders had until the end of 2020 to work out a trade deal. There are big changes ahead.Although it's a trade deal that has been agreed, there will also be changes to how people travel between the EU and UK, and to the way they live and work. But Mr Keefe said a combination of factors including lower-than-normal traffic volumes due in part to factories shutting for a longer Christmas break, a temporary suspension of most customs checks and preparation for the new rules should keep traffic moving. ""Things will start slowly. 1 January will be a quiet Bank Holiday after New Year's Eve. I don't think traffic will build up until late in the first or second week of January."" ""This initial quiet period will allow everyone to prepare."" Mr Keefe said its new systems had been in place since March 2019 when the UK was initially expected to leave the EU, giving it time to test and refine the checks required.

"New rules are coming into force on Thursday to govern how pilots can operate their drones. They harmonise the rules across all EU member states, Norway and Iceland - and will also be mirrored by the UK. They make it clear where drones can be flown, as well as making it easier to trace owners. The distinction between commercial and recreational use has been removed, potentially paving the way for more drone uses. Drone legislation has been confusing and varied nation to nation. DJI, one of the world's biggest drone makers,welcomed the changes,external. ""It streamlines different processes and allows customers to travel from country to country without having to worry about different rules in different foreign locations,"" said Christian Struwe, the firm's director of public policy. Under the rules,external, even small drones will need to be registered with the relevant aviation authority, which in the UK is the Civil Aviation Authority. Allow Twitter content?

This is to ensure that authorities can trace who owns a drone if they are used in an irresponsible way or flown somewhere they are not allowed to be used. Under the rules, there will be three new types of drone category: high, medium and low. Low-risk or open-category drones will not require any authorisation but will be subject to strict operational limitations Medium-risk or specific-category drones will have to have authorisation from the national aviation authority on the basis of a risk assessment High-risk or certified-category drones will need to follow aviation rules, and this will apply to future drone flights with passengers The low-risk category, which accounts for the majority of hobbyist drones, will be managed through the CE mark, which is a process for products sold in Europe to ensure they meet health, safety and environmental standards. But drones within this category will also have additional rules about where they can be flown: A1 - drones weighing less than 250g (0.55lb) can be flown over people A2 - drones weighing more than 250g but less than 2kg must be flown at least 50m (164ft) away from people A3 - drones weighing more than 2kg must be flown well away from people UK-based users are still required to have passed the CAA's official theory test and to have obtained a flyer ID to be allowed to fly any drone weighing over 250g within 150m of people. The Royal Mail recently used a drone to deliver a parcel to a remote lighthouse on Mull Elliott Corke, director of Global Drone Training, said the new rules might give people the idea that they could unpack a drone and just fly it. ""We would encourage people to read the manual and practise somewhere safe first,"" he said. Drones will have been a popular Christmas present this year, but there is also an increased use of unmanned aerial vehicles in businesses too. The Covid crisis has seen some places relax regulations to allow drones to be used to fly medical supplies, with a recent test from Cornwall to the Isles of Scilly carried out. Meanwhile, the UK's Royal Mail tested drone deliveries for the first time in December, with a parcel drop to a remote lighthouse on the Isle of Mull.

"France is mobilising 100,000 police and gendarmes on New Year's Eve to break up parties and enforce a curfew imposed to combat coronavirus. The extra security also aims at halting the torching of cars that often takes place on the final night of the year. France has confirmed 2.6m Covid-19 cases, the fifth highest total in the world, and more than 64,000 deaths. Like other European countries, France will see muted celebrations for New Year's Eve amid the pandemic. In her New Year address, German Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke emotionally about the pandemic which had ""imposed a lot on everyone, and too much on some"" in 2020. She reached out to those who had lost loved ones to Covid-19, and she attacked coronavirus conspiracy theories, ""which are not just false and dangerous, but also cynical and cruel towards those people"". French Interior Minister GÃ©rald Darmanin has ordered a visible security presence in city centres and flashpoint suburbs from 20:00 (19:00 GMT), when the curfew begins. In Paris half of the metro lines will be closed in the evening, while Mr Darmanin also asked for a wider public transport shutdown across the country to be considered. Despite rising cases,and concerns over a new more contagious strain of the disease,a government spokesman said there was no need for local lockdowns for now. France has had two national lockdowns and bars, restaurants and cultural attractions will remain closed into January. Mr Darmanin has written to regional leaders informing them of Thursday's ""exceptional"" mobilisation of 100,000 police and gendarmes. Officers will be instructed to break up underground parties as soon as they are reported, fine participants and identify the organisers. Patrols meanwhile are to carry out ""appropriate identity checks"" and search vehicles. Only half of metro lines in Paris will run on New Year's Eve Mr Darmanin also urged shops to limit or stop the sale of flammable liquids in portable containers and takeaway alcoholic drinks. He has also suggested that local authorities do not publicise incidents of cars set alight, to ""avoid any incidence of 'competition'"" between different areas. Car burning has effectively become an annual event in French suburbs since riots in 2005 in Paris and elsewhere. Last year a record 1,457 cars were torched across France on New Year's Eve, according to media reports. The previous year's figure was 1,290. Inthe UK, a further 20 million people in Englandwere placed into the toughest tier of restrictions from Thursday. ""I must ask you to follow the rules where you live tomorrow night and see in the new year safely at home,"" Prime Minister Boris Johnson said during a press conference. This video can not be played The prime minister says he's confident the UK's Covid situation will be ""very much better"" by 5 April The whole of mainlandScotlandhas been under level four - the top tier of measures - since 26 December and will remain there for at least three weeks. People have been urged to remain at home on New Year's Eve. InItaly, a 10pm curfew has been imposed, and bars, restaurants and most shops are closed. The country is under nationwide lockdown until 7 January. Meanwhile Pope Francis will not lead New Year's Eve and New Year's Day services in theVatican, after suffering a recurrence of chronic hip pain. Irelandwill move to its highest level of restrictions on Thursday, banning all household visits, closing all non-essential retail and limiting travel to 5km. Germanyis currently under lockdown until 10 January. The government has banned the sale of fireworks and put in place tight restrictions on the number of people who can gather in public. Health Minister Jens Spahn said he expects the country to have the ""quietest New Year's Eve"" in living memory.,external The Netherlandsis under a lockdown set to last until 19 January.

"Secondary schools across most of England are to remain closed for an extra two weeks for most pupils, to help regain control of coronavirus. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson told the Commons that exam-year pupils would return a week earlier than their schoolmates in the week of 11 January. In the meantime, schools will have more time to set up mass testing plans. In a few areas with the highest infection rates, primaries would remain closed temporarily, he added. The areas where primary schools would remain closed are: most of London, much of Essex and Kent, Hastings and Rother in East Sussex, Milton Keynes and parts of Hertfordshire. Mr Williamson said the temporary school shutdowns would cut chains of transmission. Primary closures would be reviewed every two weeks. But teaching unions said the move did not go far enough, and one labelled it another ""last-minute mess"". They have been calling for a working test-and-trace system since before schools returned from the lockdown in September. The move comes after most of England was put into the toughest tier four restrictions, and follows warnings from medics about pressure on hospitals - and from government scientists about the increasing contagiousness of the new strain of coronavirus. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""We must face the reality. The sheer pace of and spread of this new variant requires us to to take even tougher action in some areas."" He stressed that the children of key workers and vulnerable pupils would still be able to return to primaries or secondaries next week. ""At this critical moment, with the prospect of freedom within reach - we've got to redouble our efforts to contain the virus,"" he said. What's happening with schools in January? Military offers remote support for pupil testing Impact of new variant on children investigated How does mass testing work? Mr Williamson said the delay in reopening secondary schools would allow head teachers to develop and set up mass testing plans for their pupils. ""In the face of a rapidly changing situation, I am determined to act to preserve lives and the NHS, as we continue to protect education and put children first. ""We are making changes to the start of term to give more time for the rollout of our first of its kind rapid testing programme, to identify students who have the virus but don't display any symptoms."" He added that the government expects to deliver 50,000 devices to schools across the country on 4 January to support remote learning, with 100,000 devices to be delivered during the first week of term. But Kate Green, Labour shadow education secretary, said: ""Only days before many schools should have been opening again to all pupils, the secretary of state has announced that many will not be returning as planned. ""This delay and disruption to children's education is a direct result of the government's failure. They've lost control of the virus. Now they're losing control of children's education."" Her Labour colleague, Yvette Cooper, said schools in her constituency had received no support or allocation of funding, and no contact from the military, which has been organising testing in some schools. She added: ""They all want to do this mass testing but the support they are getting is always too late, too chaotic."" But Mr Williamson said the testing programme would help keep education settings as safe as possible for all students. ""Because Covid infection rate is particularly high among this age group,"" he said, ""we are going to allow more time so that every school and college is able to fully roll out testing for their pupils and staff. ""This kind of mass testing will help protect not just children and young people, but benefit everyone in the community. ""It will break those chains of transmission that are making infection rates shoot up."" The primary schools affected would be reopened as soon as possible, Mr Williamson said, adding that testing for primary school staff would follow in January.

Hertfordshire:Watford, Broxbourne, Hertsmere and Three Rivers. It is a significant step, as ministers have repeatedly stated that schools would remain open - and even threatened council areas which wanted to close their schools early for Christmas with legal action. The general secretary of the Nasuwt teachers' union, Patrick Roach, said the announcement offered belated clarity but did not go far enough. ""Stronger preventative action is needed to limit the further transmission of the coronavirus in schools and colleges, including enabling the greater use of remote and blended learning which would enable effective social distancing, which is vital to minimising virus transmission."" The leader of the National Association of Head Teachers, Paul Whiteman, said: ""This is another last-minute mess which could so easily have been avoided if the government had listened to school leaders before the holidays. ""Instead, back then, schools which wanted to shift to remote learning were threatened with legal action. Now we have a situation where the government is instructing schools to reduce the amount of teaching time available. ""If we'd had the freedom to take action before the holidays, we might have been in a position to have more schools open for more pupils. School leaders will be baffled, frustrated and justifiably angry tonight."" Schools were struggling to remain Covid-safe during the autumn term, despite the intense efforts of teachers and staff, with huge numbers of pupils contracting the virus and then being sent home. All primary schools had been due to fully reopen on 4 January, along with secondary schools opening for vulnerable children and those sitting exams this year (Years 11 and 13). Remaining secondary school pupils were to start term working remotely from home. Effectively, the whole process has been shunted back a week. This is two weeks after the usual start of term.

A full return to the classroom is expected to be completed by 18 January. Northern Ireland:All schools will initially reopen for face-to-face teaching at the start of term, but years 8 to 10 will move to remote learning from 25 January for at least two weeks. Schools in all the UK nations are remaining open for vulnerable children. England, Wales and Scotland have also committed to maintaining face-to-face teaching for children of key workers.

The care home said its staff were working in very challenging circumstances A retirement home in Belgium has been hit by a major coronavirus outbreak, which has seen at least
26 residents lose their lives and more than 100 test positive. The outbreak was detected a
few days after the 5 December visit to the Hemelrijck home in Mol of a volunteer
dressed as Santa Claus. The visitor has since
tested positive for Covid-19, although a health official has told the AFP it is
not yet certain that he is the source of the outbreak. Regional health spokesman
Joris Moonens said there was no suggestion the visitor knew he was infected when he attended the home, and in the absence of a formal complaint no inquiry has been launched. Belgian virologist Marc Van
Ranst tweeted last Friday that most of the infected residents carried the same variant
of the virus as the volunteer. The home itself said its
staff were continuing âto work in very challenging circumstances to give the
residents all the necessary care and to keep the outbreak under controlâ. The UK's leading share index - the FTSE 100 - hassuffered its worst year since the height of the financial crisis. Pension savers and investors' nest-eggs have been savaged as the the FTSE 100 index fell 14.3% over the year, marking its worst performance since 2008, when it slumped 31.3%. Despite the poor performance, the blue-chip index has recovered significantly since the start of the global pandemic when it was a third lower than now. Analysts say that next year is likely to be better for investors. ""The factors which worked against the FTSE-100 in 2020 - the pandemic, a deep recession and Brexit - will start to fade into the background,"" says Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. The UK has reported another
55,892 daily cases of coronavirus, up from 50,023 on Wednesday. It also recorded a further
964 deaths within 28 days of a positive test, compared with 981 yesterday. Tougher coronavirus restrictions came into force for millions more people in England today, with some 20 million entering the toughest tier four measures. They join people across the UK who have seen tougher rules brought in over the festive period. Head hereto find out the rules where you live. A couple swiftly arranged a same-day weddingto avoid missing out when their area moved to the highest tier of coronavirus restrictions in England. The drama started at 15:00 GMT yesterday when it was announced Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire would move from tier three to tier four at 00:01 today. Weddings with up to 15 guests are allowed in tier three but only services with ""exceptional circumstances"" are permitted in tier four. Jemma and Josh Copestake, from Shirebrook, Derbyshire, had been due to marry on Saturday. Jemma, 32, said when the new measures were announced she was resigned to the service, which had already been postponed from August, having to be pushed back again. But her sister persuaded her they should try to make it happen that day - and when the vicar confirmed she was available to lead the service, they summoned guests to the Nottinghamshire village of Church Warsop, for a wedding at 17:30. As well as the 15 invited guests inside the church, more than 100 friends and locals stood socially distanced outside to welcome them to the ceremony, which was also streamed online. Instead of a wedding reception, the newlyweds rounded off their day with a takeaway pizza at home. ""It may not have been how we planned it but it was beautiful,"" Jemma said. Marine FC are in the eighth tier of English football A non-league English football teamis holding a raffle to recoup some of the Â£100,000 they stand to loseas their match with Tottenham Hotspur is now having to be played behind closed doors. Marine FC play Jose Mourinho's Premier League team in the third round of the FA Cup on 10 January, but fans will be barred from the Merseyside stadium due to coronavirus restrictions. Liverpool's new tier three statusmeans there will now be no crowd inside the 3,185-capacity stadium, costing the eighth-tier club not only gate receipts, but also about Â£70,000 in sponsorship deals. Marine's chief executive officer James Leary said it was necessary but ""galling"". The part-timers have instead launched a virtual Â£10 match ticket raffle - the top prize is the chance to replace the manager in the dugout for a pre-season friendly - which could raise about Â£30,000. Simon ReadBusiness Reporter British people spent less and saved more in 2020as the pandemic led to shops, pubs and attractions being closed down. Consumer spending was down 7.1%, says Barclaycard, which tracks almost half of all credit and debit card spending. However, spending on essential items climbed 4.1%, while independent businesses benefited as many more of us shopped locally. The Barclaycard data showed that we spent an extra 28.6% at independent food and drink shops, such as off-licences, butchers and bakeries, compared with a year earlier. Online grocery shopping surged 70.3% over the year, spending on fuel fell by more than a fifth - 20.3%, and we also spent 15.6% less on clothing. Meanwhile, a separate survey from Aldermore Bank found Brits working from home saved an average Â£110 a week. Health workers face burnout, soaring sickness levels and ""intolerable"" pressures because of the ongoing coronavirus crisis, union leaders have warned. Employers have been urged do all they can to find ways of maintaining staff levels at ""swamped"" hospitals. Unison warned that staff were being ""pushed to the brink"" as hospitals struggle to cope with rising coronavirus cases and winter pressures. The union said every option should be explored to avoid simply making healthcare workers do extra shifts, such as recruiting former NHS staff. Unison's assistant general secretary, Christina McAnea, said: ""Lots of people came forward during the first wave offering to return to the NHS and everything possible should be done to ensure they can help. ""We know that many who offered were not used. ""The government must learn lessons that allowing NHS staff shortages to go unchecked causes immense damage when the chips are down."" States like Florida are vaccinating older residents Twenty million vaccinations by the end of 2020 was the goal set by Trump administration officials - but the US has fallen far short of that so far. As of Wednesday,more than 12 million Covid vaccine doseshave rolled out, butonly 2.7 million peoplehad received their first dose, according to the Centers for Disease Control. The same day, the US saw a record3,927 Covid-related deathsin 24 hours, bringing the total number of deaths in the country tomore than 342,000. Some of the lag is due to reporting delays from across the country, but members of Operation Warp Speed, President Trump's vaccine development and rollout programme, also acknowledge the numbers haven't met expectations. Officials promise things will speed up in the coming weeks, especially as health centres learn how to store and administer the vaccines. As the rollout continues, states are taking the initiative to immunise vulnerable groups. Colorado, Texas and Florida, for example, are now vaccinating older residents along with health workers. President-elect Joe Biden, who will take office on 20 January, has promised to distribute 100m vaccines in his first 100 days, though the exact details of how his rollout might differ from President Trump's remain to be seen. Key workers and high-risk people are already getting vaccines in China China has given conditional approval for a coronavirus vaccine developed by state-owned drugmaker Sinopharm to be given
to the general public. The decision came a day after the firm
said interim data showed its vaccine had a 79% efficacy rate in phase three
trials. Several Chinese-made vaccines at a late trial stage are already in use in China after being granted emergency licences. Beijing hopes to inoculate tens of millions of people by mid-February, the start of the Chinese New Year. Some experts have given a cautious
welcome to the Sinopharm vaccine however, pointing out that the firm has not
made public any detailed data from the trials. You can read more on this story here. Coronavirus case rates are continuing to rise in all regions of England, according to the latest weekly figures from Public Health England. London's rate of new cases stood at 735.5 per 100,000 people in the seven days to 27 December, up from 711.9 in the previous week. Eastern England saw the second highest rate (551.3, up from 510.8) followed by south-east England (450.6, up from 427.4). Yorkshire and the Humber had the lowest rate: 188.3, up from 172.4. Public Health England medical director Dr Yvonne Doyle said: ""The Christmas week saw a worrying rise in cases across every region of the country, particularly among adults in their 20s and 30s. ""We must not now add further fuel to the fire, as meeting in close and large groups this New Year's Eve risks further transmission. ""The way we can beat this virus remains the same, whatever the variant. Reduce close contact with others and follow the guidance."" Smitha MundasadHealth reporter Alongside the UK medicines regulatorâs approval of a second
coronavirus vaccine yesterday came a significant shift in strategy designed to
vaccinate as many vulnerable people as fast as possible. Central to the new plan is a delay of up to 12 weeks between
administering  the first and second doses required for each vaccine. This will buy more time to vaccinate more people. But does it have an impact on the overall effectiveness of
the jabs? Professor Peter Openshaw, of Imperial College London, told
BBC News that it was a ""highly plausible"" strategy. He says there is ""pretty convincing"" data, published
within MHRA (Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency) documents, showing
some enhancement of antibody protection when the second dose of the
Oxford/AstraZeneca jab is delayed. But he says the Pfizer jab has not been tested in the same way so there is no comparable evidence. ""I would reassure people that just after the first
dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine it is pretty solid protection that cuts in
at about two weeks and it looks like that protection will last for some time,"" he adds. Prof Openshaw agreed it made ârational senseâ to get the first dose to
as many people are possible, but he said, âit is a bit surprising given
we donât have data to support this delay.â Along with many other scientists he says long term
monitoring of both jabs will be crucial to ensure people get adequate
protection. The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine was on Wednesday approved for use in the UK Plans to delay giving out the second dose of the coronavirus vaccine have been criticised by GP leaders - who say the move will cause huge problems for thousands of partially-vaccinated elderly and vulnerable people. On Wednesday the government announcedit had changed its vaccination strategy, saying it would now prioritise giving out the first doses of the vaccines. It said second doses of both the Oxford-AstraZeneca and the Pfizer/BioNTech jab would then be given up to 12 weeks after the first dose. The initial plan for the Pfizer vacine was two jabs within 21 days, GPs have warned the change will affect tens of thousands of elderly and vulnerable patients who were due to get their second dose of the Pfizer jab in the coming days and weeks. The head of the British Medical Association's GP committee said it was ""grossly unfair"" to delay the second jabs for high-risk patients and the policy was causing huge logistical problems. Pfizertold the Guardian,externalthat there was no data to demonstrate that protection after the initial dose was sustained after 21 days. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Scotland has been warned to bring in the new year at home, as events and socialising are banned this Hogmanay. The first minister, police chiefs and local council leaders have urged the public to welcome 2021 within their own household. Nicola Sturgeon told Scotland there should be ""no gatherings, no house parties and no first footing"". Police Scotland said people should ""do the right thing"" and reminded them that parties were not allowed. New Year's Eve looks very different this year, with a further 2,622 Covid cases recorded in the past 24 hours -the highest daily figureto be posted since mass testing in Scotland began. Nicola Sturgeon has appealed to the public to keep Hogmanay within the household There is no relaxing of the rules as there was for Christmas Day and all of mainland Scotland is in level four restrictions. The ""home of Hogmanay"" - Edinburgh - has only online events planned. 'Stay at home' Hogmanay plea as Covid cases surge New Covid strain 'becoming dominant' in Scotland Oxford vaccine roll out begins in Scotland on 4 January The Scottish government's messaging has asked the public to protect each other and the NHS by staying at home to suppress the virus. The first minister asked the nation to ""stick with it and keep looking after each other"" to ensure a safe start to 2021. During a statement to parliament she said everyone must remain vigilant during the difficult winter weeks ahead. She said: ""As this awful year draws to a close, let me again thank everyone across Scotland for your sacrifice and patience, and for looking out for each other. ""We have every reason to believe that the spring of 2021 will bring better times but we must first get through these difficult few weeks of winter. ""It is vital we keep doing everything we can to suppress this virus to keep ourselves and our loved ones safe and to protect the NHS."" She said people should mark the new year responsibly and in line with current restrictions. ""To be clear, that means no gatherings, no house parties, and no first footing"", she said. ""Instead, we should bring in 2021 in our own homes with just our own household. ""We know our prospects for the rest of the year will be better if we get off to a safe start so let's stick with it, and keep looking after each other. ""And let me wish everyone when it comes a better, brighter and happier new year."" Police Scotland said its approach, as it has been throughout the pandemic, would be to engage with the public, explain the legislation and guidance, and encourage compliance. But the force said it would not hesitate to continue to use enforcement powers as a last resort. Deputy Chief Constable Malcolm Graham said: ""We're asking everyone to continue to do the right thing to stop the spread of this virus and protect public health as it is clear that there is an ongoing risk. ""Remember that parties and indoor gatherings of different households are not permitted and we will continue to use our enforcement powers to disperse large groups of people where necessary. ""Please follow the Scottish government's advice, which is to celebrate Hogmanay and the New Year with your own household only, in your own home."" There will be no street party this year after Edinburgh moved its events online The streets of Edinburgh will be empty for the first time in recent memory following the cancellation of the world famous street party, and the celebration has moved entirely online. Council Leader Adam McVey said: ""The best and safest place to celebrate Hogmanay this year is at home. ""Cases have increased significantly so please don't go round to friends' houses and keep adhering to the guidance - more gatherings at Hogmanay will cause increased risk to people across the capital and, in particular, our NHS staff and services. ""Following the rules now is the quickest way to get restrictions lifted and hopefully we can look back at this Hogmanay as one of our final sacrifices in the battle against the virus. ""As 2020 comes to a close and with the roll out of vaccines under way, we can look more positively towards 2021. But for now, and this Hogmanay, please keep following the guidance, please stay at home and keep yourself and others safe."" LEVELS:What are the restrictions in your area?

"New rules are coming into force on Thursday to govern how pilots can operate their drones. They harmonise the rules across all EU member states, Norway and Iceland - and will also be mirrored by the UK. They make it clear where drones can be flown, as well as making it easier to trace owners. The distinction between commercial and recreational use has been removed, potentially paving the way for more drone uses. Drone legislation has been confusing and varied nation to nation. DJI, one of the world's biggest drone makers,welcomed the changes,external. ""It streamlines different processes and allows customers to travel from country to country without having to worry about different rules in different foreign locations,"" said Christian Struwe, the firm's director of public policy. Under the rules,external, even small drones will need to be registered with the relevant aviation authority, which in the UK is the Civil Aviation Authority. Allow Twitter content?

This is to ensure that authorities can trace who owns a drone if they are used in an irresponsible way or flown somewhere they are not allowed to be used. Under the rules, there will be three new types of drone category: high, medium and low. Low-risk or open-category drones will not require any authorisation but will be subject to strict operational limitations Medium-risk or specific-category drones will have to have authorisation from the national aviation authority on the basis of a risk assessment High-risk or certified-category drones will need to follow aviation rules, and this will apply to future drone flights with passengers The low-risk category, which accounts for the majority of hobbyist drones, will be managed through the CE mark, which is a process for products sold in Europe to ensure they meet health, safety and environmental standards. But drones within this category will also have additional rules about where they can be flown: A1 - drones weighing less than 250g (0.55lb) can be flown over people A2 - drones weighing more than 250g but less than 2kg must be flown at least 50m (164ft) away from people A3 - drones weighing more than 2kg must be flown well away from people UK-based users are still required to have passed the CAA's official theory test and to have obtained a flyer ID to be allowed to fly any drone weighing over 250g within 150m of people. The Royal Mail recently used a drone to deliver a parcel to a remote lighthouse on Mull Elliott Corke, director of Global Drone Training, said the new rules might give people the idea that they could unpack a drone and just fly it. ""We would encourage people to read the manual and practise somewhere safe first,"" he said. Drones will have been a popular Christmas present this year, but there is also an increased use of unmanned aerial vehicles in businesses too. The Covid crisis has seen some places relax regulations to allow drones to be used to fly medical supplies, with a recent test from Cornwall to the Isles of Scilly carried out. Meanwhile, the UK's Royal Mail tested drone deliveries for the first time in December, with a parcel drop to a remote lighthouse on the Isle of Mull.

"Prof Alka Surajprakash Ahuja said her award acknowledges ""all the hard work of the team"" Healthcare workers in Wales are among those recognised in the New Year honours list for their work during the coronavirus pandemic. The woman behind NHS Wales' Video Consulting Service, and a senior matron who expanded critical care capacity in Swansea, are among those honoured. Others include a retired police officer who led a volunteer response to Covid. Welsh Secretary Simon Hart said they were ""inspiring achievements"" in an ""extraordinarily challenging year"". Swansea great Curtis to be made MBE Honours for Lewis Hamilton and Covid volunteers Prof Alka Surajprakash Ahuja, a consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist, from Cardiff, will be appointed MBE for services to the NHS during the pandemic. Having helped establish the NHS Wales Video Consulting Service, she was asked in March for this service to be rapidly scaled up for people to continue to access healthcare advice and services from their homes during the pandemic - which she called a ""mammoth task"". ""What would usually have taken years needed to be done in a matter of weeks,"" she said. She said she had ""mixed feelings moving away from front line"" but was proud of the work she had managed to achieve. ""It has enabled us to deliver a safe delivery of care whilst protecting the work force. ""It is obviously an honour to be recognising but is very humbling because it is a team effort."" Carol Doggett has been appointed MBE for services to leadership and nursing care Carol Doggett, 51, head of nursing for medicine at Morriston Hospital in Swansea, will also be appointed MBE for services to leadership and nursing care for intensive care patients and staff, particularly during Covid-19. At the onset of the pandemic, Mrs Doggett was tasked with expanding the critical care capacity for the area. She trained a cohort of 156 redeployed staff and ensured 13 members of staff who became patients on the intensive care unit received the same high level of care and support as others. Mrs Doggett said: ""I am overwhelmed by this award and recognition. ""I accept it on behalf of all the staff from critical care and other departments who stepped up and supported the enormity of the first wave and on behalf of all the patients we nursed with Covid in ITU."" Dr Tamas Szakmany said he was ""very surprised"" to hear he would be appointed MBE Dr Tamas Szakmany, a Critical Care Consultant at Newport's Royal Gwent Hospital, is also being appointed MBE for services to the NHS during Covid-19 and said he was ""very surprised"". On top of his clinical duties and research into Covid-19 he has spent twice his normal clinical time at the bedside, personally looking after more than 50 patients, participating in numerous webinars, teleconference calls and other online tutorials to help share lessons learnt from his days on the ICU. ""I had an email that I was considered and I had to check the email twice to see if it is real and not a scam,"" he said. Dr Szakmany said it was a recognition for the clinical teams, research teams and critical care network, who ""are making sure every patient can receive the critical care despite the pressures we face"". The number of special constabulary officers doubled to almost 200 under Mark Owen's leadership Special chief officer Mark Owen, from Llanynys in Denbighshire, will be appointed MBE for his services to policing and to the community in north Wales, particularly during the Covid-19 response. He returned to work and oversaw a team of volunteers to help out with tasks including delivering prescriptions and food parcels, keeping regular phone contact with the vulnerable, helping out with shopping and reassuring the community. Under his leadership, the number of special constabulary officers doubled to almost 200. He said: ""You are asking people to volunteer their time, to put on police uniform and to go out on a Friday night and involve themselves in quite vicious and quite nasty circumstances. ""You are asking them to do it for nothing, so it's a real challenge."" In June alone, 8,000 hours were recorded by volunteers. ""It is the equivalent of having a massive amount of extra police resources on the streets of north Wales, literally engaging and encouraging our communities and supporting them directly in our hour of need which has been exposed in this last few months.""

""We were very fortunate in 2020 to have a space where we could offer access to the arts and art education. ""We received a sustainability grant from the Arts Council of Wales to enable us to pay for all the PPE and reduced class sizes etc and, as we watched people heal and grow, we saw just how important art can be.

Speaking on BBC Breakfast he saidhe was confident secondary schools will be ready to test year 11 and 13 pupilsreturning to classrooms on 11 January. On Wednesday, Mr Williamson announced that around one million pupils in at-risk areas would not return to school as planned on Monday - when term is due to start. People should avoid New Year's Eve celebrations because ""Covid loves a crowd"", officials warn, as millions enter the toughest restrictions tier.

Meanwhile, Scotsare urged to celebrate Hogmanay differently. Hundreds of people who helped the UK's response to the coronavirus pandemicwill be awarded honours in the new year. Among them is 104-year-old Ruth Saunders, who becomes an MBE for services to charity during Covid after walking a marathon to raise money for Thames Valley Air Ambulance this year.

"Samuel Little confessed to murdering 93 people Samuel Little, a man described by the FBI as the most prolific serial killer in US history, has died aged 80. Little died in a California hospital on Wednesday, the state Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation said. He was serving a life sentence for the murder of three women. But by the time of his death, he had confessed to killing 93 women between 1970 and 2005. Little targeted vulnerable individuals, many of whom were sex workers or drug users, officials say.

The 40-year hunt for a killer A former competitive boxer, Little would knock his victims out with punches before strangling them - meaning that there were not always obvious signs, like stab or bullet wounds, the person had been murdered. Instead many deaths were incorrectly determined to be overdoses or accidental and were never investigated. Some bodies have never been found, the agency said. Last year, the FBI said its analysts believed all of his confessions were ""credible"". They also released images of the victims he drew while in prison in an attempt to trace those he killed. The FBI released Samuel Little's drawings in the hope that the victims could be identified. Little was arrested in 2012 on a drugs charge in Kentucky and extradited to California, where officers carried out DNA testing on him. He already had an extensive criminal record, with offences from armed robbery to rape across the US. The DNA results linked him to three unsolved murders from 1987 and 1989 in Los Angeles County.

"Tesco, Pizza Hut and Superdrug are among more than a hundred firms ""named and shamed"" by the government for not paying workers the minimum wage. Almost 140 companies,externalinvestigated between 2016 and 2018 failed to pay Â£6.7m to more than 95,000 workers. The minimum wage ranges from Â£4.15 an hour for apprentices, to Â£8.72 an hour for over-25s. Tesco, Pizza Hut and Superdrug said the underpayments were historic errors and staff had been swiftly reimbursed. The city with the world's highest minimum wage Workers 'sleeping on mattresses' inside factory 'I worked a five-hour shift and got paid nothing' Ministers said the offending firms -which included hotels, restaurants, car washes and shops,external- short changed tens of thousands of workers, in what they described as a ""completely unacceptable breach of employment law"". Cases included employers taking deductions from wages for uniforms, training or parking fees or failing to raise employees' pay after a birthday which should have moved them into a higher minimum wage bracket. It is the first time the government has named firms for failing to pay the national minimum wage since 2018, following reforms to the process to make sure only the worst offenders are revealed. The Business Minister Paul Scully said he was especially disappointed to see big household names on the list but he said it should be a ""wake-up call"" to bosses. ""It is never acceptable for any employer to short-change their workers, but it is especially disappointing to see huge household names who absolutely should know better on this list,"" he added. The UK national minimum wage sets out the least a worker can be paid per hour by law. As of April 2020, it stood at Â£8.72 an hour for people aged 25 and older - the government refers to this main rate as the National Living Wage. There are four minimum wages below this amount for younger workers and apprentices: The National Minimum Wage for 21 to 24-year-olds - Â£8.20 For 18 to 20-year-olds - Â£6.45 For under-18s - Â£4.55 For apprentices - Â£4.15 TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said many firms which failed to pay their workers the minimum wage still wouldn't be named. ""The government raised the threshold for naming employers compared with the old scheme, meaning fewer bad bosses are exposed."" Tesco said a technical issue in 2017 meant some workers' pay ""inadvertently"" fell below the minimum wage and it had reported the issue itself to HMRC. ""In most cases the reimbursement was Â£10 or less,"" the supermarket said. Pizza Hut and Superdrug both said the error was related to a previous uniform policy, which required staff to wear a particular colour trousers and shoes. ""It is important to stress that there was never any intent to underpay our employees,"" said Pizza Hut. Superdrug said it had changed its policy to make sure the issue did not happen again.

"There is ""absolutely no reason"" schools in England will not be ready to mass test pupils when they return next term, the education secretary has said. Gavin Williamson said he wanted school closures to be as ""short as possible"" afterdelaying their reopeningamid surging coronavirus cases. It comes as people are being warnednot to gather on New Year's Eve. Some 20 million people in England have been told to ""stay at home"" after tier four was expanded at midnight. They join the 24 million already in the toughest restrictions - meaning non-essential businesses must close, and people should stay home unless they have a ""reasonable excuse"". How will mass testing help schools? Where has the new school term been delayed? We've all seen this coming, say angry heads Which areas are going into tier four and what are the rules? On Thursday the UK recorded a further 55,892 new Covid cases, as well as 964 more deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Defending the delay to term, Mr Williamson said the government was ""battling this hidden enemy"" - and that there was Â£78m of funding for schools to get testing up and running. Equipment such as personal protective equipment (PPE) would be delivered next week andthere would be support from the military. But teaching unions saidthe move did not go far enough, and one labelled it ""another last-minute mess"". Meanwhile an intensive care doctor has urged people not to gather ahead of the New Year and said those who do not follow social distancing rules or wear maskshave ""blood on their hands"". Prof Hugh Montgomery, professor of intensive care medicine at University College London, said: ""It is making me actually very angry now that people are laying the blame on the virus, and it is not the virus, it is people, people are not washing their hands, they are not wearing their masks."" NHS England medical director Prof Stephen Powis said it was ""absolutely vital"" people stayed home and did not mix, saying ""Covid loves a crowd"". Health Secretary Matt Hancock said people must take ""personal responsibility"". England's tier four restrictions mean people cannot meet other households indoors, unless they are part of a support bubble, while hospitality businesses and those such as hairdressers and nail bars must shut. In Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said thereshould be ""no gatherings, no house parties"" for Hogmanayas all of the mainland remains in the highest level of restrictions. Asix-week lockdownbegan in Northern Ireland on 26 December, while Wales also has a national lockdown with people banned from visiting other households. TESTING:How do I get a virus test? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters SCHOOLS:What will happen if children catch coronavirus? The warnings came after the UK announced theapproval of a second vaccine for coronavirus, the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab,with the first doses due to be given on Monday. The latest figures show 786,000 people have received the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine between 8 December and 27 December, NHS England said. GPs are to be offered Â£10 for every care home resident vaccinated and NHS staff will also be prioritised now that the Oxford jab has been approved, the health service said. Deepti Gurdasani, epidemiologist and senior lecturer at Queen Mary University of London, told BBC Radio 5 Live there appeared to be a ""bottleneck"" in the delivery of the jabs with the volume of vaccines given was ""six times lower"" than the two million per week target. A total of 232,169 people tested positive for Covid in England at least once in the week to 23 December, up 33% on the previous week and the highest weekly rise on record,the latest NHS Test and Trace figures show,external. Covid case rates are continuing to rise in all regions of England - with London's rate at 735.5 per 100,000 people in the seven days to 27 December, up from 711.9 the previous week, the latest Public Health England (PHE) surveillance report showed. Eastern England saw the second highest rate, 551.3 up from 510.8, followed by south-east England at 450.6, up from 427.4. PHE medical director Dr Yvonne Doyle said Christmas week had seen a worrying rise in cases, adding ""we must not now add further fuel on the fire"" by meeting in groups for New Year's Eve. Meanwhile, the NHS in London has been asked to make sure the London Nightingale hospital is ""reactivated and ready to admit patients"", an NHS spokesman said. Mr Williamson announced on Wednesday that secondary schools across most of England are to remain closed for an extra two weeks for most pupils, to help regain control of coronavirus amid concernsabout a fast-spreading new variant. Some primary schools in Covid hot-spots,externalwill not reopen on Monday, he said, but the Department for Education confirmed on Thursday there would be a review every two weeks. The education secretary told BBC Breakfast that remote learning would be ""mandatory"" from the week commencing 11 January for all secondary students, other than years 11 and 13 who would physically return to school on that date. As soon as news emerged of the new faster-spreading variant questions began to be asked about schools. An analysis by Public Health England released this week showed there was no evidence it was more able to infect children than other variants. But that does not mean infection rates have not been rising among children. As with all age groups, the proportion of school children testing positive increased during December - with more virus around, there was more transmission. Primary school children however still remain one of the age groups with the lowest infection rates, according to Public Health England analysis of people who test positive. This of course is likely to miss asymptomatic cases and random testing by the Office for National Statistics suggests infection levels could be higher. Regardless of this, the sheer scale of the infection levels in the worst-hit areas means ministers wanted to buy themselves time, hence some primaries will remain closed. If large numbers of pupils and staff need to isolate, it makes the smooth-running of schools impractical. Ministers are hoping mass testing coupled with the tougher restrictions - three-quarters of England are now in the highest tier - will be enough to curb infection levels and keep a lid on the spread in schools. But it is clear they will have to tread carefully to achieve that. Mr Williamson said more than 85% of primary schools were reopening on Monday and he wanted any closures to be ""short"". Meanwhile, council leaders said plans toclose primary schools in 22 London boroughs but not in 10 othershave ""no logic"". A Department for Education spokesperson said decisions on which areas were affected by the changes to school reopening plans were based on the number of new infections, positivity rates and pressures on the NHS. Scots prepare for Hogmanay at home amid party ban Warning over New Year's Eve 'freedom' party 'New Year parties not worth the risk' warning In Northern Ireland primary pupils will be taught remotely until 11 January whileonline learning will be in place for some post-primary pupils for the entirety of January. Scotland has set arestart dateof 18 January for face-to-face learning with the majority being taught online from 11 January, while in Wales pupils aredue to return on a staggered basis.

"Wang Xiangjun sought to raise awareness of climate change with his videos of glaciers A popular Chinese social media influencer and environmentalist dubbed ""Glacier Bro"" is presumed dead after falling into icy waters in Tibet. Wang Xiangjun, 30, was reportedly exploring a glacial waterfall when he disappeared on 20 December. His body has not yet been found, but his social media account appeared to confirm his death on Saturday. Wang was known for his videos exploring glaciers and his efforts to highlight the impact of climate change. Footage shared on Chinese social media appears to show him lose his balance while climbing near the base of a waterfall and he is seen slipping into fast-flowing icy waters. The incident took place in Lhari county, northern Tibet, according to reports. Rescuers are still searching for him, but a member of the rescue team quoted by China's Global Times newspaper said it was likely that Wang had been swept under an ice floe - a sheet of floating ice - and that it was ""almost impossible"" that he had survived. Spy satellites reveal rapid Himalayan glacier melt Study identifies danger glacial lakes across Tibetan Plateau China sets surprise 2060 carbon neutrality goal At the weekend, a sorrowful tribute posted by the administrator of Wang's official Kuaishou social media account appeared to confirm his death. ""My brother... lies forever in his favourite waterfall. I hope everyone does not hype up [his death], and respect the deceased,"" read the statement. ""For all of his life he was obsessed with glaciers, and gave his life to glaciers. This is the best resting place for him."" Wang had posted videos online using his official social media handle Tibetan Adventurer Born in rural Sichuan province to a family of farmers, Wang became interested in glaciers when he saw a tourism advert for a snow-capped mountain, according to Chinese state news agency Xinhua. In the years that followed, he visited dozens of glaciers and posted videos on social media under the handle Tibetan Adventurer. His clips, which usually featured him clambering across icy terrain and enthusiastically exploring glacial caves and tunnels, quickly went viral. He was also known in China for photographing more than 70 glaciers in seven years, and had addressed the UN Climate Change Conference last year to share his experience of melting glaciers. As a result of his travels, he became passionate about raising awareness of the impact of climate change. ""Almost all the glaciers I visited looked different from the images on my phone,"" he told Xinhua in January. ""You need to stand in front of the glaciers to realise how fast they are melting."" China, which is the world's biggest source of carbon dioxide, said in September that itaimed to hit peak emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060.

"A rollout of the first approved vaccine - the Pfizer Covid-19 jab - is already under way Wales will get 22,000 doses next week of the second approved Covid vaccine, the Welsh Government has said. Dr Gillian Richardson, the doctor leading the rollout described getting theOxford-AstraZeneca vaccineto people across Wales as a ""huge task"". She originally said there would be 40,000 doses but the Welsh Government later    said it expected to reach that figure by the second week of January. Meanwhile Public Health Wales said 35,335 people had hadthe Pfizer jab. When asked how long the rollout of the latest vaccine would take, Dr Richardson toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfast: ""We can only give it at the rate at which it arrives, so some of that is not predictable with some of the international players in the vaccine manufacturing world but of course with Oxford we have a lot more control. ""So, by the time the Oxford-AstraZeneca is manufactured using a good steady flow, we'll be able to give you some of those predictions, but just now what we can say is we are doing those that are most vulnerable first, and we will get to everybody in their turn - please bear with us."" She also said it was ""excellent news"" the two doses could be administered up to 12 weeks apart, meaning more people could get their first jab sooner. She urged people to follow Wales' coronavirus restrictions as they celebrate new year: ""Please for everybody - take extra care. ""That'hands, face, space',externalmessage is really important, especially tonight, celebrate safely and enjoy yourself safely. ""It's going to be a while before we see vaccine turn the corner on those hospitalisations."" When will I get the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine? Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid vaccine clinics to be set up in Wales Covid vaccine: Older people's commissioner warns of 'confusion' Dr Helen Alefounder, a GP in Colwyn Bay, Conwy county, said she had not been told what date she would be administering the jab from, but planning was in full swing. Residents in Wales vaccinated by heath board, to 27 December 5,487Aneurin Bevan 4,604Betsi Cadwaladr 5,706Cardiff & Vale 4,789Cwm Taf Morgannwg 5,276 + 3,250Hywel Dda and Powys 5,285Swansea Bay She said: ""It's not just as simple as somebody turning up and having a vaccination, it's everything else that has to be considered with it. ""Logistically it's a huge, huge ask. ""However, we do it every year for flu, so we really have a good background knowledge of everything that we need to do and everything we need to provide. ""It's just simple things like making sure that there's places for people to park and making sure that you can maintain social distancing and making sure that you can allow people time to sit afterwards after their vaccine in case of reactions."" Health boards across Wales are warning that despite the hope offered by the Covid vaccines, hospitals are under relentless pressure in this latest wave of infections. On Thursday, Cardiff and Vale University Health Board announced it would cease all non-urgent surgery and outpatient appointments in January. It follows similar decisions to halt non-urgent treatment at theSwansea BayandAneurin Bevanhealth boards earlier in December. ""This is to redeploy staff in support of urgent and emergency care, including critical care,"" said Steve Curry, the chief operating officer of Cardiff and Vale. The board said it had also opened a new ""surge facility"" at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff. ""The additional Lakeside Wing bed capacity will be used to support demand in the coming weeks,"" added Mr Curry. The medical director at neighbouring Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board said all its sites ""remain under significant pressure with unprecedented demand"". ""This is extremely challenging for out staff,"" said Nick Lyons. ""We currently have more than 600 suspected, confirmed or recovering Covid-19 patients in our hospitals and ITUs across our sites are over capacity. The situation is extremely serious."" Royal Glamorgan Hospital consultant Dr Dai Samuel says the NHS in Wales is ""teetering on the brink"" Dr Dai Samuel, a consultant hepatologist at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital in Llantrisant, Rhondda Cynon Taf, has been working on Covid wards during the pandemic. He said the rollout of a second vaccine was good news, but urged people to still follow restrictions: ""The position with the vaccine is very good but we are in an acute situation. ""It's very difficult across the NHS. We are teetering on the brink. A few days of bad luck can bring us to our knees. It's very challenging. ""I just say [to people], carry on listening to what you have been told for months."" More than 35,000 people have now received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in Wales, including people such as healthcare workers who work in Wales but live over the border in England. Almost 13,000 of these vaccines were given in the past week. Plaid Cymru has called on the Welsh Government to ask the UK government to publish evidence to justify increasing the period between the two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine from 21 days to 12 weeks. In a letter to the Health Minister Vaughan Gething, the party's health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said the ""sudden switch"" represented ""a very significant departure"" from previous guidelines. He added there were ""very real concerns"" that a longer delay between doses ""could significantly decrease the effectiveness of the vaccine"". The Welsh Conservatives criticised the speed of the rollout. Health spokesman Andrew RT Davies said: ""Three weeks ago, the first Covid-19 vaccine was given in Wales, and since that time we have sadly seen confusion and hope drop away.

"Sir Keir Starmer has predicted the UK's ""best years are still to come"", as he delivered his first New Year message as Labour leader. He said he would fight for ""prosperity, fairness and opportunity"" as the country ""rebuilds"" following Covid. Twenty million more people in England have entered the toughest - tier four - coronavirus restrictions, amid a surge in infections. But the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine has been given the go-ahead for next week. There will be 530,000 doses available from Monday, on top of the Pfizer-BioNTech jabs whichbegan earlier this month. A further 50,023 new Covid cases were recorded in the UK on Wednesday, as well as 981 more deaths within 28 days of a positive test - more than double the previous day's total. Twenty million in England added to top Covid tier Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine approved for use in UK In his message, Sir Keir said the UK - which has seen an8% contraction in gross domestic product (GDP),externalsince January - had suffered more than any other major economy during the pandemic, but vaccines would eventually improve the situation. He added: ""Until then, it is all of our duty to stay safe, to look after neighbours, keep up the national effort that has got us this far. ""Because when this crisis ends, and it will end, we will rebuild our country, together."" At a Downing Street press conference on Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the government would ""shift heaven and earth"" to vaccinate people as quickly as possible. But, with the new strain of coronavirus spreading, it was important to ""redouble our efforts"" to prevent this, he added. The prime minister traditionally releases a New Year's message to the nation on 31 December. On Wednesday, Sir Keir - Labour leader since April - ordered his MPs to back the government's post-Brexit trade deal with the EU, arguing that to do otherwise would raise the chances of no deal, which he said would damage the economy even more than the PM's ""thin"" agreement. ""The United Kingdom is forging a new path in the world,"" he said in his message. ""And the Labour Party that I lead will focus on ensuring that path leads to greater prosperity, fairness and opportunity for every nation and region, every village, every town and city that makes up our great United Kingdom. ""I believe this can once again be the best country to grow up in and the best country to grow old in. ""And with that hope and that vision, I believe that our best years are still to come."" Three members of Labour's shadow ministerial teamresigned on Wednesdayrather than vote for the government's deal, which the House of Commonspassed by a majority of 448.

"Samuel Little confessed to murdering 93 people Samuel Little, a man described by the FBI as the most prolific serial killer in US history, has died aged 80. Little died in a California hospital on Wednesday, the state Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation said. He was serving a life sentence for the murder of three women. But by the time of his death, he had confessed to killing 93 women between 1970 and 2005. Little targeted vulnerable individuals, many of whom were sex workers or drug users, officials say. FBI releases serial killer's drawings Why was there a spike in serial killers? The 40-year hunt for a killer A former competitive boxer, Little would knock his victims out with punches before strangling them - meaning that there were not always obvious signs, like stab or bullet wounds, the person had been murdered. Instead many deaths were incorrectly determined to be overdoses or accidental and were never investigated. Some bodies have never been found, the agency said. Last year, the FBI said its analysts believed all of his confessions were ""credible"". They also released images of the victims he drew while in prison in an attempt to trace those he killed. The FBI released Samuel Little's drawings in the hope that the victims could be identified. Little was arrested in 2012 on a drugs charge in Kentucky and extradited to California, where officers carried out DNA testing on him. He already had an extensive criminal record, with offences from armed robbery to rape across the US. The DNA results linked him to three unsolved murders from 1987 and 1989 in Los Angeles County. He pleaded not guilty at trial, but was eventually convicted and sentenced to three consecutive life sentences, with no chance of parole.

"Scotland has been warned to bring in the new year at home, as events and socialising are banned this Hogmanay. The first minister, police chiefs and local council leaders have urged the public to welcome 2021 within their own household. Nicola Sturgeon told Scotland there should be ""no gatherings, no house parties and no first footing"". Police Scotland said people should ""do the right thing"" and reminded them that parties were not allowed. New Year's Eve looks very different this year, with a further 2,622 Covid cases recorded in the past 24 hours -the highest daily figureto be posted since mass testing in Scotland began. Nicola Sturgeon has appealed to the public to keep Hogmanay within the household There is no relaxing of the rules as there was for Christmas Day and all of mainland Scotland is in level four restrictions. The ""home of Hogmanay"" - Edinburgh - has only online events planned. 'Stay at home' Hogmanay plea as Covid cases surge New Covid strain 'becoming dominant' in Scotland Oxford vaccine roll out begins in Scotland on 4 January The Scottish government's messaging has asked the public to protect each other and the NHS by staying at home to suppress the virus. The first minister asked the nation to ""stick with it and keep looking after each other"" to ensure a safe start to 2021. During a statement to parliament she said everyone must remain vigilant during the difficult winter weeks ahead. She said: ""As this awful year draws to a close, let me again thank everyone across Scotland for your sacrifice and patience, and for looking out for each other. ""We have every reason to believe that the spring of 2021 will bring better times but we must first get through these difficult few weeks of winter. ""It is vital we keep doing everything we can to suppress this virus to keep ourselves and our loved ones safe and to protect the NHS."" She said people should mark the new year responsibly and in line with current restrictions. ""To be clear, that means no gatherings, no house parties, and no first footing"", she said. ""Instead, we should bring in 2021 in our own homes with just our own household. ""We know our prospects for the rest of the year will be better if we get off to a safe start so let's stick with it, and keep looking after each other. ""And let me wish everyone when it comes a better, brighter and happier new year."" Police Scotland said its approach, as it has been throughout the pandemic, would be to engage with the public, explain the legislation and guidance, and encourage compliance. But the force said it would not hesitate to continue to use enforcement powers as a last resort. Deputy Chief Constable Malcolm Graham said: ""We're asking everyone to continue to do the right thing to stop the spread of this virus and protect public health as it is clear that there is an ongoing risk. ""Remember that parties and indoor gatherings of different households are not permitted and we will continue to use our enforcement powers to disperse large groups of people where necessary. ""Please follow the Scottish government's advice, which is to celebrate Hogmanay and the New Year with your own household only, in your own home."" There will be no street party this year after Edinburgh moved its events online The streets of Edinburgh will be empty for the first time in recent memory following the cancellation of the world famous street party, and the celebration has moved entirely online. Council Leader Adam McVey said: ""The best and safest place to celebrate Hogmanay this year is at home. ""Cases have increased significantly so please don't go round to friends' houses and keep adhering to the guidance - more gatherings at Hogmanay will cause increased risk to people across the capital and, in particular, our NHS staff and services. ""Following the rules now is the quickest way to get restrictions lifted and hopefully we can look back at this Hogmanay as one of our final sacrifices in the battle against the virus. ""As 2020 comes to a close and with the roll out of vaccines under way, we can look more positively towards 2021. But for now, and this Hogmanay, please keep following the guidance, please stay at home and keep yourself and others safe."" LEVELS:What are the restrictions in your area?

"Wang Xiangjun sought to raise awareness of climate change with his videos of glaciers A popular Chinese social media influencer and environmentalist dubbed ""Glacier Bro"" is presumed dead after falling into icy waters in Tibet. Wang Xiangjun, 30, was reportedly exploring a glacial waterfall when he disappeared on 20 December. His body has not yet been found, but his social media account appeared to confirm his death on Saturday. Wang was known for his videos exploring glaciers and his efforts to highlight the impact of climate change. Footage shared on Chinese social media appears to show him lose his balance while climbing near the base of a waterfall and he is seen slipping into fast-flowing icy waters. The incident took place in Lhari county, northern Tibet, according to reports. Rescuers are still searching for him, but a member of the rescue team quoted by China's Global Times newspaper said it was likely that Wang had been swept under an ice floe - a sheet of floating ice - and that it was ""almost impossible"" that he had survived. Spy satellites reveal rapid Himalayan glacier melt Study identifies danger glacial lakes across Tibetan Plateau China sets surprise 2060 carbon neutrality goal At the weekend, a sorrowful tribute posted by the administrator of Wang's official Kuaishou social media account appeared to confirm his death. ""My brother... lies forever in his favourite waterfall. I hope everyone does not hype up [his death], and respect the deceased,"" read the statement. ""For all of his life he was obsessed with glaciers, and gave his life to glaciers. This is the best resting place for him."" Wang had posted videos online using his official social media handle Tibetan Adventurer Born in rural Sichuan province to a family of farmers, Wang became interested in glaciers when he saw a tourism advert for a snow-capped mountain, according to Chinese state news agency Xinhua. In the years that followed, he visited dozens of glaciers and posted videos on social media under the handle Tibetan Adventurer. His clips, which usually featured him clambering across icy terrain and enthusiastically exploring glacial caves and tunnels, quickly went viral. He was also known in China for photographing more than 70 glaciers in seven years, and had addressed the UN Climate Change Conference last year to share his experience of melting glaciers. As a result of his travels, he became passionate about raising awareness of the impact of climate change. ""Almost all the glaciers I visited looked different from the images on my phone,"" he told Xinhua in January. ""You need to stand in front of the glaciers to realise how fast they are melting."" China, which is the world's biggest source of carbon dioxide, said in September that itaimed to hit peak emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060.

"Dawn Wells (centre) played Mary Ann, the wholesome girl next door, on Gilligan's Island American actress Dawn Wells has died of causes related to Covid-19 at the age of 82. Wells, who portrayed Mary Ann Summers in the classic sitcom Gilligan's Island, passed away peacefully in Los Angeles on Wednesday morning, her publicist Harlan Boll said. The iconic show ran for 98 episodes from 1964 to 1967. ""There is so much more to Dawn Wells"" than the character that brought her fame, Mr Boll said in a statement. Wells represented her state of Nevada in the 1959 Miss America pageant before becoming a household name on Gilligan's Island, which was based around three women and four men stranded on a desert island. The iconic show ran for 98 episodes from 1964 to 1967 At the time of the Vietnam War, many saw the light-hearted show as welcome respite. Wells appeared in many other TV shows and films, including 77 Sunset Strip, Maverick, and Bonanza. But it is for Gilligan's Island that Wells will be remembered and her following remained faithful decades on, with her Facebook boasting over 540,000 followers.

"This video can not be played The prime minister says he's confident the UK's Covid situation will be ""very much better"" by 5 April A further 20 million people in England will join the toughest tier of Covid restrictions from Thursday. The Midlands, North East, parts of the North West and parts of the South West are among those escalated to tier four. And secondary schools across most of Englandare to remain closed for an extra two weeks for most pupils. The public must ""redouble"" its efforts at this ""critical moment"", the PM said, before adding he was confident things will be ""very much better"" by 5 April. ""All of these measures in the end are designed to save lives and protect the NHS,"" he said at a Downing Street briefing. ""For that very reason, I must ask you to follow the rules where you live tomorrow night and see in the new year safely at home."" Earlier, the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine wasapproved for use in the UK, with the first doses to be given on Monday. But Boris Johnson warned that people should not ""in any way think that this is over"" as ""the virus is really surging"". His comments came as a further 50,023 new Covid cases were recorded in the UK on Wednesday, as well as 981 more deaths within 28 days of a positive test - more than double Tuesday's total. Will schools go back in January? What are the lockdown and tier four rules? New coronavirus variant: What do we know? Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live Under tier four rules, non-essential shops, beauty salons and hairdressers must close, and people are limited to meeting in a public outdoor place with their household, or one other person. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told MPs that rising cases across England mean it is ""therefore necessary to apply tier three measures more broadly too, including in Liverpool and North Yorkshire"". In tier three areas, household mixing is banned indoors and in private gardens, while the rule of six applies in public spaces. Shops, gyms and personal care services can remain open, but hospitality settings must close except for takeaway. All of the tier changes will come into effect at 00:01 GMT on Thursday 31 December. This video can not be played 'Covid loves a crowd... so stay at home this New Year's Eve' says NHS boss Following his colleague in the Commons, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said secondary schools across most of England will remain closed for an extra two weeks for most pupils. He added that exam-year pupils will return a week earlier than their schoolmates in the week of 11 January, and in a small number of areas with the highest infection rates, primaries will remain closed temporarily. Commenting on the delay, the prime minister said: ""We must face the reality, the sheer pace of the spread of this new variant, requires us now to take even tougher action in some areas, and that does affect schools."" This video can not be played Laura Kuenssberg challenges Boris Johnson on Brexit and vaccines Speaking to the BBC earlier, Mr Johnson said that 60% of UK coronavirus cases were now the new, more transmissible, strain of Covid-19. Asked by political editor Laura Kuenssberg if the government had been too slow to act, he said: ""What we, unfortunately, were not able to budget for was this this new variant."" He added: ""It's spreading rapidly from the places where it's started, in the east of London and in Kent. And, alas, it's starting to seed across the country.""

News of approval for a second Covid vaccine has been followed by more restrictions. It means, with the exception of a few pockets, the whole of the UK is pretty much in lockdown. The fear now is that this will become the status quo for weeks. Hospitals are clearly struggling, with close to 24,000 patients in hospital with Covid - that's around one in five beds. Until those numbers start coming down, the restrictions are likely to stay in place. The jury is still out on how significant the impact of these will be on the new faster-spreading variant. If the effect is limited, a quick rollout of the vaccine is crucial for not just saving lives but returning the country to some normality. The approval of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is vital. It is easier to store and distribute than the Pfizer-BioNTech jab and there are already millions of doses in the country. A network of local vaccination centres are also ready to go with GPs believing they can vaccinate two million people a week reasonably comfortably if there is good supply. With global demand for vaccines and the ingredients and facilities needed to produce them, it is clear where the biggest hurdle now lies. This video can not be played Matt Hancock: ""It's a day of mixed emotions"" Announcing the rule changes, Mr Hancock said: ""I know that tier three and four measures place a significant burden on people, and especially on businesses affected, but I am afraid it is absolutely necessary because of the number of cases that we've seen."" Labour shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said people across England ""will be deeply worried"" that they have now been ""in a form of restriction for months and months and months"". ""It's having a huge impact on families and small businesses,"" he added. 'Worrying virus uptick' puts Liverpool in Tier 3 Tier 4 move 'critical blow' for Greater Manchester Tier 4 'frustrating' but 'light at end of tunnel' Meanwhile, a statement on behalf of nine council and other leaders in the north-east of England urged the government to replace its regional approach with a national lockdown ""to ensure the spread of the new variant is slowed and efforts can be focused on the crucial roll-out of the vaccine"". ""This is a national problem and a national solution is required now,"" they added. Elsewhere in the UK,WalesandNorthern Irelandare both in lockdown, as is mainlandScotland. The approval of the Oxford vaccine - of which the UK has ordered 100 million doses - means vaccination centres will now start inviting patients to receive the first of their two doses from next week. Priority groups for immunisation have already been identified, starting with care home residents, the over-80s, and health and care workers. The health secretary told the Commons the UK already has 530,000 doses available from Monday, ""with millions due from AstraZeneca by the beginning of February"". He added that the ""clinical advice is that the Oxford vaccine is best deployed as two doses up to 12 weeks apart"". More than 600,000 people in the UK have been given the Pfizer-BioNTech jab sinceMargaret Keenan became the first person in the world to be given a Covid vaccineoutside a clinical trial. It is hoped that about two million patients a week could soon be vaccinated with the two jabs that have now been approved. Prof Jonathan Van-Tam - the deputy chief medical officer for England - said that both Pfizer and AstraZeneca were currently testing to see if their vaccines worked against the new Covid strain. However, it could be 12 to 14 days before either company can give a ""solid steer"", he added. TESTING:How do I get a virus test? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area?

The first minister, police chiefs and local council leaders have urged the public to welcome 2021 within their own household. Nicola Sturgeon told Scotland there should be ""no gatherings, no house parties and no first footing"". Police Scotland said people should ""do the right thing"" and reminded them that parties were not allowed. New Year's Eve looks very different this year, with a further 2,622 Covid cases recorded in the past 24 hours -the highest daily figureto be posted since mass testing in Scotland began. Nicola Sturgeon has appealed to the public to keep Hogmanay within the household There is no relaxing of the rules as there was for Christmas Day and all of mainland Scotland is in level four restrictions. The ""home of Hogmanay"" - Edinburgh - has only online events planned. 'Stay at home' Hogmanay plea as Covid cases surge New Covid strain 'becoming dominant' in Scotland Oxford vaccine roll out begins in Scotland on 4 January The Scottish government's messaging has asked the public to protect each other and the NHS by staying at home to suppress the virus. The first minister asked the nation to ""stick with it and keep looking after each other"" to ensure a safe start to 2021. During a statement to parliament she said everyone must remain vigilant during the difficult winter weeks ahead. She said: ""As this awful year draws to a close, let me again thank everyone across Scotland for your sacrifice and patience, and for looking out for each other. ""We have every reason to believe that the spring of 2021 will bring better times but we must first get through these difficult few weeks of winter. ""It is vital we keep doing everything we can to suppress this virus to keep ourselves and our loved ones safe and to protect the NHS."" She said people should mark the new year responsibly and in line with current restrictions. ""To be clear, that means no gatherings, no house parties, and no first footing"", she said. ""Instead, we should bring in 2021 in our own homes with just our own household. ""We know our prospects for the rest of the year will be better if we get off to a safe start so let's stick with it, and keep looking after each other. ""And let me wish everyone when it comes a better, brighter and happier new year."" Police Scotland said its approach, as it has been throughout the pandemic, would be to engage with the public, explain the legislation and guidance, and encourage compliance. But the force said it would not hesitate to continue to use enforcement powers as a last resort. Deputy Chief Constable Malcolm Graham said: ""We're asking everyone to continue to do the right thing to stop the spread of this virus and protect public health as it is clear that there is an ongoing risk. ""Remember that parties and indoor gatherings of different households are not permitted and we will continue to use our enforcement powers to disperse large groups of people where necessary. ""Please follow the Scottish government's advice, which is to celebrate Hogmanay and the New Year with your own household only, in your own home."" There will be no street party this year after Edinburgh moved its events online The streets of Edinburgh will be empty for the first time in recent memory following the cancellation of the world famous street party, and the celebration has moved entirely online. Council Leader Adam McVey said: ""The best and safest place to celebrate Hogmanay this year is at home. ""Cases have increased significantly so please don't go round to friends' houses and keep adhering to the guidance - more gatherings at Hogmanay will cause increased risk to people across the capital and, in particular, our NHS staff and services. ""Following the rules now is the quickest way to get restrictions lifted and hopefully we can look back at this Hogmanay as one of our final sacrifices in the battle against the virus. ""As 2020 comes to a close and with the roll out of vaccines under way, we can look more positively towards 2021. But for now, and this Hogmanay, please keep following the guidance, please stay at home and keep yourself and others safe."" LEVELS:What are the restrictions in your area?

"New rules are coming into force on Thursday to govern how pilots can operate their drones. They harmonise the rules across all EU member states, Norway and Iceland - and will also be mirrored by the UK. They make it clear where drones can be flown, as well as making it easier to trace owners. The distinction between commercial and recreational use has been removed, potentially paving the way for more drone uses. Drone legislation has been confusing and varied nation to nation. DJI, one of the world's biggest drone makers,welcomed the changes,external. ""It streamlines different processes and allows customers to travel from country to country without having to worry about different rules in different foreign locations,"" said Christian Struwe, the firm's director of public policy. Under the rules,external, even small drones will need to be registered with the relevant aviation authority, which in the UK is the Civil Aviation Authority. Allow Twitter content?

This is to ensure that authorities can trace who owns a drone if they are used in an irresponsible way or flown somewhere they are not allowed to be used. Under the rules, there will be three new types of drone category: high, medium and low. Low-risk or open-category drones will not require any authorisation but will be subject to strict operational limitations Medium-risk or specific-category drones will have to have authorisation from the national aviation authority on the basis of a risk assessment High-risk or certified-category drones will need to follow aviation rules, and this will apply to future drone flights with passengers The low-risk category, which accounts for the majority of hobbyist drones, will be managed through the CE mark, which is a process for products sold in Europe to ensure they meet health, safety and environmental standards. But drones within this category will also have additional rules about where they can be flown: A1 - drones weighing less than 250g (0.55lb) can be flown over people A2 - drones weighing more than 250g but less than 2kg must be flown at least 50m (164ft) away from people A3 - drones weighing more than 2kg must be flown well away from people UK-based users are still required to have passed the CAA's official theory test and to have obtained a flyer ID to be allowed to fly any drone weighing over 250g within 150m of people. The Royal Mail recently used a drone to deliver a parcel to a remote lighthouse on Mull Elliott Corke, director of Global Drone Training, said the new rules might give people the idea that they could unpack a drone and just fly it. ""We would encourage people to read the manual and practise somewhere safe first,"" he said. Drones will have been a popular Christmas present this year, but there is also an increased use of unmanned aerial vehicles in businesses too. The Covid crisis has seen some places relax regulations to allow drones to be used to fly medical supplies, with a recent test from Cornwall to the Isles of Scilly carried out. Meanwhile, the UK's Royal Mail tested drone deliveries for the first time in December, with a parcel drop to a remote lighthouse on the Isle of Mull.

"Leeds shared the above tweet along with footage of Carney's comments Karen Carney has deleted her Twitter account three days after a tweet by Leeds United questioning her comments as a pundit led to online abuse. Leeds' owner defended Tuesday's message but the club condemned the abuse aimed at the former England international. Carney said Leeds ""out-run"" opponents and an enforced rest during the Covid-19 pandemic aided their Championship promotion push last season. The Women in Football group said Leeds' tweet was ""inappropriate"". The video of Carney's comments shared in the tweet, which remains on Leeds' account, has been viewed 5.8m times. Carney, who won 144 England caps, made her comments during Tuesday's Amazon Prime broadcast of Leeds' 5-0 win over West Brom in the Premier League. Football in the UK was on hold between March and June because of the coronavirus pandemic and Carney, 33, said of Leeds: ""They out-run everyone and credit to them. My only concern would be will they blow up at the end of the season? ""We saw that the last couple of seasons. I actually think they got promoted because of Covid in terms of it gave them a bit of respite. I don't know if they would have got up if they didn't have that break."" Leeds won the Championship by 10 points in 2019-20. They won seven and drew one of their nine Championship matches when football resumed in June following the initial Covid-19 lockdown. They had won six and drawn one of their nine fixtures before the lockdown. United's tweet sharing footage of Carney's comments tagged the account of Amazon Prime, for whom she works as a pundit. United's owner Andrea Radrizzani, replying to a tweet which said Leeds should be ""ashamed"" of their actions, wrote: ""I take the responsibility of the club tweet. ""I consider that comment [from Carney] completely unnecessary and disrespectful to our club and particularly to the fantastic hard work of our players and coaches."" The Premier League club later said: ""Everyone at our club respects Karen greatly for all she has achieved in the game, as well as her work in the media and the charity work she undertakes."" Former Leeds and England defender Rio Ferdinand was among those who called on the club to delete the post, which has been retweeted 11,500 times. Others in the media said the tweet was inflammatory and would invite criticism of former Birmingham, Arsenal and Chelsea winger Carney on social media. Tennis commentator David Law tweeted: ""Did you really need to tweet something like this and invite a pile-on?"" French journalist Philippe Auclair wrote: ""To publish such a tweet on an official club account was already questionable, to say the least. To keep it there when its target is receiving abuse which was prompted by your tweet is simply wrong."" And USA international Megan Rapinoe said: ""Shame. Shame. Shame. Thicken up that skin y'all. Also, don't come for Karen Carney she's a National treasure."" The Women in Football group tweeted: ""Whether you agree with the comment or not, singling out and ridiculing an individual on an official club account is not what we're here for. Karen Carney is a well-informed pundit. This tweet is inciteful and inappropriate. Not a good look now, or at any time."" Brighton defender Ben White - an ever-present on loan at Leeds last season - shared footage of Carney's comments along with 'laughing' emojis. Leeds' win over West Brom lifted them to 11th in the Premier League with 23 points from 16 games. Only six newly-promoted teams in Premier League history have picked up more victories than Leeds' seven at this stage of a campaign.
