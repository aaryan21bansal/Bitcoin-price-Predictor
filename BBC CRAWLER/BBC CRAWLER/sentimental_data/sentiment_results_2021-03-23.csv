"Prince Harry and his wife have stepped away from royal duties The Duke of Sussex is to become chief impact officer at the US coaching and mental health firm, BetterUp. Prince Harry saidin a statement,externalthat he was ""really excited"" about taking on the new role. His exact duties, hours and any payment are not clear. It is his latest job move after he and the Duchess of Sussexstepped back as senior royals in March last year. It also comes after the duke and Meghan gave an explosive interview to Oprah Winfrey earlier this month. In it, the couple alleged an unnamed royal family member had asked about how dark their son Archie's skin might be, before he was born. Buckingham Palace has said the claim is ""concerning"", but it will be addressed privately. Earlier this week, Buckingham Palace said adiversity review was under wayacross all royal households. 12 things we learned from Meghan's Oprah interview Harry and Meghan step back Harry and Meghan rattle monarchy's gilded cage In his statement, Prince Harry said his goal in his new function would be to ""lift up critical dialogues around mental health, build supportive and compassionate communities, and foster an environment for honest and vulnerable conversations"". Prince Harry will not manage employees or have people report directly to him, but he is likely to spend some time in the company's San Francisco headquarters once it is safe to do so,BetterUp CEO Alexi Robichaux told the Wall Street Journal,external(WSJ). In his role as the company's first chief impact officer, Prince Harry is expected to have input into initiatives including product strategy decisions and charitable contributions, and advocate publicly on topics related to mental health, the WSJ reports. Prince Harry said that when he met Mr Robichaux, they ""instantly recognised a shared passion for helping others realise their full potential"". The chief impact officer position is relatively rare in the corporate world, notes the WSJ - it is seen more commonly in non-profit organisations such as Amnesty International. BetterUp, which was founded in 2013, provides mobile-based professional coaching, counselling and mentorship. The firm saysit has some 2,000 coaches offering services in 49 languages in 66 countries,external. Prince Harry has previously launched initiatives such as the Invictus Games, which aim for members of the armed forces to use sport for psychological and physical rehabilitation. He has also advocated publicly on mental health issues. Prince Harry and Meghan now live in Californiaafter confirming in January that they would step back as ""senior"" royals and work to become financially independent.

"This video can not be played The giant ship is causing a traffic jam in one of the world's busiest waterways A giant container ship the length of four football pitches has become wedged across Egypt's Suez Canal, blocking one of the world's busiest trade routes. Dozens of vessels are stuck, waiting for rescue boats to free the 400m-long (1,312ft) ship, which was knocked off course by strong winds. Egypt has reopened the canal's older channel to divert some traffic until the grounded ship can move again. The blockage sent oil prices climbing on international markets. In pictures: Container ship blocks Egypt's Suez Canal About 12% of global trade passes through the Suez Canal, which connects the Mediterranean to the Red Sea and provides the shortest sea link between Asia and Europe. The Ever Given, registered in Panama and operated by the shipping company Evergreen,was bound for the port city of Rotterdam in the Netherlands from China,externaland was passing northwards through the canal on its way to the Mediterranean. The 200,000 tonne vessel got stuck amid high winds The 200,000 tonne ship, built in 2018 and operated by Taiwanese transport company Evergreen Marine, ran aground and became lodged sideways across the waterway at about 07:40 local time (05:40 GMT) on Tuesday. At 400m long and 59m wide, the ship has blocked the path of other vessels which are now trapped in lines in both directions. The company that manages the container ship, Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement (BSM), has denied earlier reports that the ship had already been partially refloated. In a statement,external, it said its ""immediate priorities are to safely re-float the vessel and for marine traffic in the Suez Canal to safely resume"". Experts have warned the process could take several days. Reuters, quoting local sources, says there are at least 30 ships blocked to the north of the Ever Given, and three to the south. Evergreen Marine said the ship was ""suspected of being hit by a sudden strong wind, causing the hull to deviate... and accidentally hit the bottom and run aground"". BSM confirmed on Wednesday that all crew were ""safe and accounted for"", with no reports of injuries. Eight tug boats are working to refloat the ship, and diggers on the ground have been removing sand from where it is wedged into the side of the canal bank. Dr Sal Mercogliano, a maritime historian based in the US state of North Carolina, told the BBC that incidents such as this were rare, but could have ""huge ramifications for global trade"". Fears that the blockage could tie up shipments of crude oil caused prices to rise by 4% on international markets on Wednesday, Reuters reported. The Kpler energy intelligence service said that more than 20 oil tankers carrying crude and refined products were affected by the jam. ""This is the largest vessel ever to go aground in the Suez Canal,"" he said, adding that the ship got lodged in the embankment and would have lost power and its ability to steer. ""If they are unable to pull her free... in a high tide, they are going to have to start removing cargo."" Julianna Cona, who says she is on board another ship located directly behind the Ever Given,wrote on Instagram,external: ""Ship in front of us ran aground while going through the canal and is now stuck sideways looks like we might be here for a little bit..."" The Suez Canal is an artery of world trade, connecting the Mediterranean with the Red Sea, and providing an avenue for vessels to pass between Asia and the Middle East and Europe. The main alternative, a passage round the Cape of Good Hope at the southern tip of Africa, takes considerably longer. On average, nearly 50 vessels per day pass along the canal, although at times the number can be much higher - accounting for some 12% of world trade. It is particularly important as an avenue for oil and liquified natural gas, enabling shipments to get from the Middle East to Europe. The nightmare scenario, then, is for this crucial route to be blocked - which is exactly what has now happened with the stranding of the Ever Given. The question now is how long the route remains impassable, as a long delay would create serious problems for shippers, delaying consignments of goods and fuel. On this occasion, reports suggest traffic could be flowing again relatively quickly, in which case the impact will be limited, although there has been a rise in the oil price. But the incident has shown what can go wrong when the new generation of ultra-large vessels like the Ever Given have to pass through the relatively tight confines of the canal. Although parts of it were expanded as part of a major modernisation programme in the middle of the last decade, it remains tricky to navigate - and accidents can happen. The ship has the capacity to carry 20,000 20-ft shipping containers, according to Reuters news agency. Nearly 19,000 ships passed through the canal in 2020, according to the Suez Canal Authority - an average of 51.5 ships per day. In 2017, a Japanese container vessel blocked the canal after it ran aground following reported mechanical issues. The Egyptian authorities deployed tug boats and the ship was refloated within hours.  1869waterway first opened 2015canal expanded to include a 22 mile parallel channel 120miles long 205m wide 24m deep The Suez Canal crosses the Suez Isthmus in Egypt - a strip of land between the Mediterranean and Red Sea. The canal is 193km (120 miles) long and incorporates three natural lakes. In 2015, Egypt's government opened a major expansion of the canal that deepened the main waterway and provided ships with a 35km (22 mile) channel parallel to it.

"David Solomon promised to enforce a rule that ensured young bankers didn't work on Saturdays The chief executive of Goldman Sachs says it's ""great"" a group of young analysts raised concerns about working conditions at the investment firm. A group of 13 US employees mocked up a presentation in which they told of 95-hour working weeks and ""inhumane"" conditions amounting to abuse. Boss David Solomon said in a message: ""It's great that this group of analysts went to their management."" But he added that going an ""extra mile"" can make a big difference for the bank. In his address to the investment bank's 34,000 staff worldwide, Mr Solomon said he expected Goldman to continue to face high demand from clients and emphasised the need to meet the challenge, saying hard work brought rewards. ""Just remember: if we all go an extra mile for our client, even when we feel that we're reaching our limit, it can really make a difference in our performance,"" he said. The analysts sent their complaints to bosses in February, but it only became public last week. Citi boss Jane Fraser has introduced Zoom-free Fridays. Mr Solomon said: ""We want a workplace where people can share concerns freely... If there are any issues, do not hesitate to reach out to ask for help."" He promised to improve working conditions at the firm. Mr Solomon said: ""I can imagine that many of you saw the presentation that a group of analysts shared with their management recently about their lack of work-life balance. Bank boss rejects work from home as a 'new normal' Bank boss gets $10m pay cut for Malaysia scandal ""This is something that our leadership team and I take very seriously."" He pledged to enforce its ""Saturday rule"" to ring-fence junior bankers' time off from Friday evening into Sunday morning. The world of investment banking is notorious for placing high demands on its employees, with remote working during the pandemic further blurring the lines between the office and home. At Citi, the fourth largest bank in the US, new boss Jane Fraser recently sent a memo designating Zoom-free Fridays and reminding staff to try to schedule calls within traditional working hours. She also added a company-wide holiday at the end of May, citing ""the need for a reset"". ""I know, from your feedback and my own experience, the blurring of lines between home and work and the relentlessness of the pandemic workday have taken a toll on our well-being,"" she wrote in the memo. ""It's simply not sustainable. ""Please try to limit scheduling calls outside of what had been traditional working hours pre-pandemic and on weekendsâ(remember those?)âWe are of course a global company that operates across time zones, but when our work regularly spills over into nights, very early mornings and weekends, it can prevent us from recharging fully, and that isn't good for you nor, ultimately, for Citi."" She told staff to speak up ""if you need more time for a reset.âIt's not a sign of weakness; we are all feeling the weariness"". The long hours and high pressures of investment banking were thrown into focus in 2015 when a 22-year-old Goldman analyst, Sarvshreshth Gupta, took his own life after complaining of working 100 hours a week and working all night. The 13 Goldman Sachs employees gave striking testimony,which began circulating on social media on Wednesday,external, detailing five hours sleep a night, harsh treatment by senior bankers and the effects on their physical and mental health. One said: ""I've been through foster care and this is arguably worse."" ""This is beyond the level of 'hard-working', this is inhumane/abuse,"" said another. Goldman is far from the only firm where staff are reporting burnout, as the pandemic blurs work-life boundaries. Nearly 90% of workers say their work-life balance is getting worse, according to arecent survey published by the Harvard Business Review,externalof 1,500 people across 46 countries. Goldman said last week in the light of the findings going viral that it had since taken steps to address employee burnout among this small group, and among wider teams. Mr Solomon's address to staff said: ""We're accelerating our efforts to hire new junior bankers across investment banking and we're internally transferring bankers to business lines where activity levels are highest."" He added the firm was trying to manage its workload and reorganise some so it would be done automatically:. ""We're also being more selective about business opportunities that we pursue, and we're working to automate certain tasks in our business.""

"An Abu Dhabi investment fund has agreed to pay Â£800m into UK life sciences, in what could be the first of billions of pounds of investment in the UK. Mubadala, one of the UAE's most active funds, will invest the money over five years. Abu Dhabi is set to invest heavily in British health, tech, green energy and infrastructure,according to the Financial Times,external. It is thought investments in the other sectors will be of a similar scale. The exact size of the total investment is not yet clear, the FT said, but could be worth up to Â£5bn. The UK government said Mubadala's investment in UK life sciences would be ""deployed alongside the UK's Â£200m Life Sciences Investment Programme"", which was announced last year. ""This partnership will enable the UK life sciences sector to develop cutting-edge technologies and research while retaining homegrown innovation and jobs,"" said the UK Minister for Investment, Gerry Grimstone. ""It will also leverage the UK and UAE's mutual priorities in building better and stronger economies through investment.""

The government says the new hubs will provide support and advice to help regional businesses to access major trade markets and boost exports, as part its efforts to boost pandemic recovery.

"It is one year since the coronavirus pandemic put Scotland, along with the rest of the UK, into lockdown. As cases rose and deaths mounted, fear took hold. Exactly 12 months on, we look back at the key moments. In the final days of February 2020, Scotland was still waiting for its first confirmed case of coronavirus to arrive. Infections had already been detected in England and most eyes in the UK were on theunfolding horror in northern Italyas hospitals filled and the death toll rose. Scotland's first confirmed casecame on 1 March, and was linked to recent travel in Italy, though we know now this was not likely to have been the country's ""Patient Zero"". Northern Italy began to be overwhelmed with cases towards the end of February It later emerged there were cases in late February linked to aNike conference in Edinburgh. And Public Health Scotland data shows thatfive people were admitted to Scottish hospitals,externalwith Covid-19 on 1 March. On 2 March First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told us to expect a ""significant outbreak"" over the coming weeks. But the speed with which the virus tore through the population took most people by surprise. On 6 March, two cases of Covid-19 were confirmed on Shetland. They were also linked to travel to Italy - a couple from the islands who had spent a long weekend in the Italian city of Naples, 500 miles (805km) to the south of the country's Covid cluster in Lombardy. Four days after Iain and Suzanne Malcolmson's test results came back, the number of confirmed cases in Shetland rose to six. Five days later, they stood at 15. By 19 March, they had risen again to 24. The numbers were modest compared to later outbreaks, but they were enough to ensure that Shetland had the highest number of cases per 100,000 in the UK. They also rooted the global Covid story firmly in one of Scotland's communities. The islands that halted an outbreak by locking down early Contact tracers from NHS Shetland worked fast to bring the outbreak under control and with some success. Daily new cases returned to zero by the end of April and remained there for a long time. The health board currently has the second lowest number of cases in Scotland, with just 224 confirmed since the start of the pandemic. The prime minister announced thenational UK lockdown on 23 March,external. In an address to the nation, Mr Johnson called coronavirus the ""biggest threat"" the country had faced for decades. ""All over the world we are seeing the devastating impact of this invisible killer,"" he said. It's strange now to see that on 23 March, just 83 new cases of Covid-19 were reported in Scotland. Today, that would be seen as a sign of an outbreak was well under control, but in March 2020 Scotland's testing strategy was in its infancy and the actual number of infections would have been vastly higher. Despite case figures being artificially low, it's still possible to see the growth rate. There was a slow build in the first days of March - and then the line on the graph steepens alarmingly. Scotland went from an average of two cases a day on 7 March to peaking at an average of 343 a day a month later. Hospital admissions and deaths also rose at a fast pace, the rates of both going from zero to their first wave peak in a matter of a few weeks. The death rate lags behind the hospital admissions rate, but only by a fortnight - an indication of the fast progression of this disease in the sickest patients. By the middle of March, there were only nine suspected Covid-19 cases among residents in adult care homes, according to Scottish government figures.y Four weeks later this figure stood at more than 1,700. It seemed the virus was tearing through the population most vulnerable to dying from the disease and the consequences of that were quickly obvious. By 20 April, more than half of all deaths per week were in care homes, and remained so until the end of May, according to the National Records of Scotland (NRS). Using the most recent NRS data from 17 March 2021, exactly a third of all Covid deaths were in care comes, with most deaths occurring in hospital. Scotland's full lockdown was eased at the end of May, with cases, deaths and hospital admissions dropping to very low levels over the summer. But the virus hadn't been eliminated and as people began to travel more widely, in the UK and abroad, the second wave began. ""Once as a society we are allowed to travel again, we brought fresh new strains into Scotland which started our second wave,"" Scotland's national clinical director Prof Jason Leitch said in December - commenting on a study that said travel had""reignited"" Scotland's outbreak. Small clusters were detected at the end of the July - one centred on acall centre in North Lanarkshireand another linked to anInverclyde pharmacy. But a much bigger outbreak was taking hold in Aberdeen, linked to bars in the city. It also started at the end of July and grew quickly enough to triggerScotland's first local lockdown on 5 August. The first minister called it the ""the biggest wake-up call"" since the early days of the pandemic - and so it proved. If the Aberdeen outbreak in August provided a warning that Covid had not disappeared, then theoutbreak among students in Septembersignalled the virus was definitely back for a second round. In mid-September, Glasgow's infection rate began to climb steeply as Covid spread among students living closely together in shared accommodation. Similar outbreaks also occurred in student populations in Edinburgh, Dundee and Aberdeen. Public Health Scotland figures clearly show the rise in infections among younger people, with the elderly perhaps now being more cautious about exposure to the virus - or protected in locked down care homes. As the number of cases built in the early autumn, the Scottish government began to apply a local restrictions strategy, with similar tactics being used in other parts of the UK. An indoor visiting ban was put in place in parts of west Scotland at the beginning of September. It was followed by even stricter measures in October across much of the central belt. Scottish ministers argued consistently that the restrictions were ""blunting"" the number of infections, though total cases in Scotland did not start going down until after theintroduction of the levels systemat the end of October. But that decline was about to be brutally interrupted. Nine cases of a new, more infectious, variant of Covid-19, first identified in south east England, werereported in Scotland on 15 December. At this stage, there were still hopes for a Christmas easing of restrictions and Ms Sturgeon urged people not to ""prematurely overreact"" to the development. But it was soon obvious the new strain was taking hold across the UK. Four days later, the Scottish governmenttightened the Christmas rules significantlyand said tough level four restrictions would be applied to all of Scotland from 26 December. The rise in cases was reflected once again in hospital admissions and deaths A full lockdown, with a firm stay at home message,was imposed across most of Scotland on 4 January. The Scottish government was facing the prospect of the second wave biting far deeper than the first, with additional winter pressure on the NHS and a Covid variant which it was feared could lead to ahigher chance of hospitalisation and death. The number of Covid patients being treated in Scottish hospitals rose quickly past the spring 2020 peak and the death rate did the same. A corner was finally turned on 12 January when hospital admissions began to fall - but by then the new strain had already done its damage. It's difficult to pick an exact date for when the first wave of Covid ended and the second began, but counting death certificates that mention Covid-19, average daily deaths reached their lowest point on 10 August. This date is also near the middle of a five-week period in the summer when there were no Covid deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Up to 10 August, there were 4,219 deaths certificates mentioning Covid. Since that date there have been a further 5,614 deaths,using the latest figures available from the NRS,external. There have been Covid deaths among younger people in Scotland - including a baby girl and two children aged between one and 14. But almost 73% of the 9,831 deaths recorded by the NRS have been among the over-75s. The lives behind the coronavirus deaths The latest figures from the NRS also show that the rate of Covid deaths gets higher the more deprived an area is. Deprivation is measured using the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation and the NRS has made estimates of the death rates in each category. The first Covid-19 vaccinations in Scotland were administered on 8 December and more than two million people have now received their first dose. There is some evidence that the vaccine is working withfalling death rates among the vaccinated, though it is difficult to separate the effect of the vaccine with the impact of the current lockdown in Scotland. However, the evidence has been encouraging enough for the Scottish government to begin to talk more optimistically about a way of life ""much closer to normality"" by the summer. Vaccination progress in Scotland has been good - about 45% of the population aged 16 or over have received a first dose of either the Pfizer or Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine. And crucially, close to 100% of those most at risk of serious illness or death from Covid-19 have been given a first dose. Barring serious disruptions to vaccine supply, the Scottish government is aiming to have offered a first dose to all adults by the end of July. The pie chart above will then be one colour, or close to it. But Covid-19 will not have disappeared. New variants may have emerged and much of the world's population will still not have been vaccinated. New infections will still be arriving in Scotland. It is then that the real test of whether the vaccine has armoured the population against Covid will begin.

"At the beginning of March 2020, I asked a senior member of the government: ""Do you feel worried?"" They replied: ""Personally? No."" But just weeks later, Downing Street was scrambling to manage the biggest crisis since World War Two. Since then, monumental decisions have had to be taken. And there have been many accusations of failings - the desperate shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE), Covid ripping through unprepared care homes, hundreds of billions borrowed and spent to keep the economy going, to name a few. I have asked 20 of the most senior politicians, officials and former officials, who either witnessed or were involved in the big decisions, to pick five pivotal moments from the past 12 months. What they say tells us so much about what really happened, what our leaders were thinking, and, strikingly, how little they knew. The contributors are not being named, so they could speak freely. On 31 January, it was reported that coronavirus had arrived in the UK, as two people were admitted to hospital. Meanwhile, more than 80 Britons evacuated from China were quarantined at a facility in the north-west of England. But for the government, Brexit had sucked up all the political energy - it was the day the country officially left the EU. The prime minister and his team were exhausted but elated. It felt like Boris Johnson had ""just really started to take flight"", one member of the team tells me. Ministers and officials had already been meeting to discuss the virus in China - but it felt thousands of miles away. There was a ""lack of concern and energy,"" one source tells me. ""The general view was it is just hysteria. It was just like a flu."" The prime minister was even heard to say: ""The best thing would be to ignore it."" And he repeatedly warned, several sources tell me, that an overreaction could do more harm than good. A small group in Downing Street had started daily meetings, after, according to one of those who attended, ""it became clear that there was no proper, 'Emergency break-the-glass' plan."" But for many of those I've spoken to, the game-changer was at the end of February, when the virus took hold in northern Italy - it was closer to home, and England's chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, had, one minister told me, warned that if it got out of China, it would become global, and be on its way to the UK. ""The biggest moment for me was when I saw those pictures of northern Italy,"" one senior minister says. ""I thought that will be us if we don't move."" Reports of the chaos there catapulted the virus, one senior minister says, ""from not on the radar, to people on the floor of hospitals in Lombardy."" They say that was the moment ""we knew that it was inevitable"". Ministers and officials became locked in arguments over how to respond. The prime minister and many cabinet ministers were reluctant to consider anything as draconian as a lockdown. To many people, the very idea would have seemed fanciful. Even stopping shaking hands seemed a step too far for the prime minister. Before the first major coronavirus briefing on 3 March, he had, I am told, been prepared by aides to say, if asked by journalists, people should stop shaking hands with each other - as per government scientific advice. But he said the exact opposite. ""I've shaken hands with everybody,"" he said, about visiting a hospital with Covid patients. And it was not just a slip, one of those present at the briefing says. It demonstrated ""the whole conflict for him - and his lack of understanding of the severity of what was coming"". A Downing Street spokesperson told the BBC: ""The prime minister was very clear at the time he was taking a number of precautionary steps, including frequently washing his hands. Once the social distancing advice changed, the prime minister's approach changed."" By this point, Mr Johnson was attending emergency committee Cobra meetings with officials and leaders from Holyrood, Belfast and Cardiff - although he had missed the first few. But one senior politician who attended at the same time says: ""The early meetings with the prime minister were dreadful."" And inside Downing Street, senior staff's concerns about the government's ability to cope grew. There were huge logistical considerations about equipment, facilities and how fast the disease might move in the UK, and questions about how effective the actions taken in China to suppress the virus would be here. It was not well understood, for example, that people without symptoms could still pass it on, nor that Britons returning from half-term holidays in northern Europe were bringing the virus back home in large numbers. ""There was a genuine argument in government, which everyone has subsequently denied,"" one senior figure tells me, about whether there should be a hard lockdown or a plan to protect only the most vulnerable, and even encourage what was described to me at that time as ""some degree of herd immunity"". There was even talk of ""chicken pox parties"", where healthy people might be encouraged to gather to spread the disease. And while that was not considered a policy proposal, real consideration was given to whether suppressing Covid entirely could be counter productive. On 3 March, when the prime minister set out the government's plan, the focus was on detecting early cases and preventing the spread. But on 12 March, with journalists crammed into the state dining room at No 10, he told the public that the country was facing its worst health crisis in a generation. Anyone with symptoms was told to stay at home for a week. Advisers seemed confident it was not yet time to close schools or stop large crowds gathering. And the government's scientists felt they had time to slow everything down - the peak was not expected for another 10-14 weeks. That same week, though, nervousness was rising among others in government that the virus was outpacing everyone's expectations, and the plans in place to smooth out the outbreak would not work. One source tells me it felt like the ""government machine was breaking in our hands"", things were ""imploding"", and within 48 hours the approach outlined on the 12th would feel out of date. There has been no shortage of controversy over whether the government was too slow to close the doors on 23 March - but many of the conversations I have had, pinpoint the moment it became urgent in No 10. On 13 March, the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) committee concluded the virus was spreading faster than thought. But it was Downing Street ""modellers in the building"", according to one current official, who pored again over the numbers, and realised the timetable that had only just been announced was likely to result in disaster. The next morning, a small group of key staff got together. Simple graphs were drawn on a whiteboard and the prime minister was confronted with the stark prediction that the plan he had just announced would result in the NHS collapsing under the sheer number of cases. Several of those present tell me that was the moment Mr Johnson realised the urgency - that the official assumptions about the speed of the spread of this new disease had been wrong. To prevent the NHS ""falling over"", he was warned, the government would have to impose measures as infections rose. And while they could be relaxed as cases fell, this pattern might recur across ""multiple waves for 18 months"". Several sources recall vividly the ""snake like graph"" they were shown that day. Then, one official says, everything started to move at ""lightning speed"". And behind closed doors - before the terrifying projections of Imperial College became public, a couple of days later - plans were accelerated. On 16 March, the public were told to stop all unnecessary social contact and to work at home if possible. New cabinet committees were formed. And the machine moved into a different phase, with the prime minister and the ""quad"" - Matt Hancock, Michael Gove, Dominic Raab and Rishi Sunak - the new decision-making form. It was, I am told, ""high tension - [with] a lot of testosterone in the room"". For many inside government, the pace of change that week was staggering - but others remain frustrated the government machine, in their view, had failed to move quickly enough. There was tension between those who wanted to ensure systems were as ready as they could be first, and others who argued vociferously that moving fast against the virus was more important than anything else. But those I spoke to now agree on one thing - how much they did not know about the disease. ""You can kick yourself about the things that you wish you knew,"" one minister says, ""but we just didn't have anything in place."" Another cabinet minister says: ""It's easy to say we should have locked down longer, gone harder, but there are more complex debates about where the national interests really lie."" And it was all so strange. One minister who made some of the public announcements when lockdown came says: ""I remember when I wrote it into the script, I just couldn't believe that I was saying this."" And one official, struck by how huge it all felt, says he googled: ""Did they shut the schools during the War?"" Another, meanwhile, admits, ""We were more blind than we told the public,"" and suggests that is still the case one year on. On 18 March, we reported that a small number of members of staff in No 10 had fallen ill. One insider says: ""People were dropping like flies."" The prime minister, however, was acting as though he was impervious to the risk. He had developed a habit of banging his own chest, telling staff he was ""strong as a bull"". Soon, though, this chest-banging turned into ""extreme coughing fits"". Tests, in short supply everywhere, were requested for him from 25 March. And two days later, he tested positive. He switched to the chancellor's bigger suite of offices so that he could keep working, screened off from the rest of the building. Insiders recall how much he hated this and, in a second spell of isolation in the autumn, chairs had to be placed across the door ""like a puppy gate"", so he could still communicate with the tiny number of staff allowed into the same part of the building. Then, at the end of March, the prime minister became increasingly ill - each video call he made to reassure the public required more takes. On 6 April, he agreed to go to St Thomas' Hospital and, struggling for breath on a phone call, I have been told, confirmed he wanted Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab to stand in for him. Initially, Downing Street tried to give the impression that all was well. Journalists were even told that Mr Johnson was working on his red boxes. That message has been put down to a mix up, and we now know this was far from the truth. The moment of genuine crisis came when he was moved into intensive care. No-one knew if the prime minister would make it through the night - or what the plan was if he did not. By this point, with so many in No 10 and in government already sick, there were, I have been told, about ""half a dozen people running things"". Fears that he might need to be intubated were shared by a tiny group inside Number 10. They discussed the possibility that ministers would have to gather in the cabinet room, with the doors closed, until they chose a successor - but there was no fixed protocol, and no conclusion was reached. The Tory Party, I have been told, even started to consider how to transfer the leadership without a contest, fearing that such a competition could be seen as ""venal"" after the prime minister's death. Then cabinet ministers were summoned urgently for a conference call. ""All of a sudden we were asked to join this call - not knowing if he was alive,"" one tells me.  Then No 10 prepared to make the news public. The Downing Street voice on the other end of the phone cracked with fear as I was asked to get to the Foreign Office as soon possible with a camera to talk to Mr Raab, who was being sent out to try to reassure the country. We reported the news that Mr Johnson was in intensive care from the back of a taxi. A former official tells me: ""We thought we really could lose him - we had to plan for a full transition."" That night was ""long and shocking"", one source says. By the end of May, the number of coronavirus cases was falling, the prime minister was back at work full time, and the public had surprised the government by overwhelmingly sticking to the rules. Furthermore, despite some embarrassing and prominent lockdown breaches - in April, for example, Scotland's chief medical officer, Catherine Calderwood, had to quit over her visits to her holiday home - there had been what one senior minister describes as ""tremendous goodwill"". But then came the Mirror and the Guardian's scoop - in March, the prime minister's chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, had travelled hundreds of miles to County Durham, after his wife fell ill with Covid. He, too, succumbed to the virus and his stay on his family's farm to recover, before returning to London, had been kept secret - apart from among a tiny number of Downing Street staff. And Mr Cummings was determined not to quit. After considering sacking him, the prime minister stuck by him - but first, there was what has been described to me as tense ""mediation between a couple deciding whether to divorce"". Before making that decision, he had summoned Mr Cummings to go through his version of events. Together, they planned for him to give this version publicly - despite others' protestations. The result was the surreal press conference in the Downing Street rose garden. Many of those I have talked to describe this episode as a terrible turning-point. ""Even for us, this is mad,"" a member of the Downing Street team tells me. Senior ministers say: ""The handling was a fiasco"". ""It was ridiculous"", and, at a time of national emergency, ""broke the political consensus"". Perhaps, after two months of lockdown, the public was ready to be angry with someone. MPs' inboxes were swamped with irate emails - mine too. ""The early pandemic washed away all the bitterness of Brexit,"" one senior minister tells me. ""That all came flooding back, all that bile, all that pent up frustration."" Some ministers tweeted their support for Mr Cummings. One of those who refused says: ""He should have resigned straight away. You lead by example. I was busy chopping logs with my chainsaw to get the frustration out."" Some polling suggests the Barnard Castle episode really did dent the public's trust in the government. ""It gave people who wanted to break the rules an excuse,"" one source says. But inside government, there was a belief that an extraordinary period of unity had already started to fade, and the public had started to tire of the rules once the government had moved towards its plans to lift them. There is no question, though, the whole misadventure made the politics of the pandemic more scratchy and less consensual. Mr Cummings was not the only one to be caught up. In June, Northern Ireland's Deputy First Minister, Michelle O'Neill, provoked anger by attending a huge Republican funeral. But it was after Barnard Castle that it felt like the mood in the country had changed. ""People wanted to portray the PM as a clown,"" one minister tells me, ""or not up to the level of events."" Britain in the summer did not feel like a country still gripped by a pandemic. ""There was loads of over optimistic messaging,"" one politician says. For example, the time when a Labour MP asked for advice at the end of June for his constituency, which was home to a popular beach and he was worried about huge numbers heading for the sea. ""Show some guts,"" the prime minister told him. In July, a grinning chancellor delivered plates of Japanese curry to unsuspecting customers at a London restaurant, to promote his ""eat out to help out"" scheme. Then the prime minister started to encourage people back to the office. But behind closed doors, there were significant doubts about the wisdom of this new mood. ""We knew there was going to be a second wave,"" one cabinet minister tells me, ""and there was a row about whether people should work from home or not - it was totally ridiculous."" The summer optimism and opening was ""the biggest mistake - a rush of blood to the head"", another senior figure says. ""The PM has to carry the can"". The prime minister believed that another lockdown would be a disaster and wanted to avoid it at all costs - but for many of those involved in making the decisions, his hostility to tightening the rules again was frustrating, dangerous and political. ""The policy objective in the summer and the autumn was - do the minimum possible,"" one tells me. But by the end of August, with Britons packing beaches, the warnings of what might come were already flickering in Number 10. Some days, sources suggest, the prime minister would express concern about the virus coming back. Others, he would be in ""let-it-rip mode"". And senior officials expressed deep concern about what seemed to be changes of heart on a daily basis. The disease would not be contained by indecision, and  by the start of September, with schools and universities having returned, ""you could clearly see a steady increase,"" a senior figure says. The testing system had not been able to keep pace with demand, and too few people were willing to, or could afford, to self-isolate if they tested positive. ""The idea that you could liberalise in the summer was based on the idea that you could whackamole with test and trace,"" the source says. ""But if you didn't whack the right moles then it doesn't work."" By the middle of September, ""the data was already screaming out"", one insider says. On the 17th, I was told by one source: ""If you do nothing now, by the end of October you will get something worse than the first wave."" The possibility of a short ""circuit breaker"" lockdown was already being discussed in Downing Street that week. Prof Whitty, the UK's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance, and Mr Cummings and others were arguing hard for action to be taken - but the prime minister was unpersuaded. Others wanted to push again - one current official recalls a ""concerted effort"" - and on Sunday 20th, the No 10 team gathered a range of scientists. But the prime minister remained reluctant. Another current official describes his attitude as, ""if there is a way not to act, why do it?"". Over the next 36 hours, I have been told, a small group inside Downing Street repeatedly tried to change Mr Johnson's mind - but by then, he was operating in a very different atmosphere. ""A swampiness had risen because of ideological pressure on this government at every turn to do less - and to do it more slowly,"" a senior figure says. And it is understood Mr Johnson had privately assured groups of MPs there would be no more restrictions. The Treasury was pointing out the damage any further restrictions would do to the economy, many of the traditional Tory-backing newspapers were hungry for restrictions to be relaxed, the party was restless, and I remember cabinet ministers who had hardly any cases of the virus in their constituencies at that point, suggesting they saw no evidence for further action. So when Mr Johnson made changes to the coronavirus restrictions on 22 September, they were tweaks, rather than a real tightening up.  I remember talking to Tory backbenchers that day who felt they had won. The importance of the missed September moment is cited by many senior figures - and some now concede it was a mistake. ""We strained at the leash to get things going,"" one cabinet minister admits. ""I was aggressively for that - but I have learned that it is better to go slow."" Another senior minister, one of those who pushed for more radical action at the time, now says: ""We should have locked down more severely, earlier in the autumn - the whole point was, the earlier you act the more you buy yourself time for a strategy that can get out."" You can still hear the frustration in the voices of those who lost the argument. ""The PM was saying the Tory Party won't swallow it,"" one tells me. ""Everyone else felt, we know we are going to have to do a lockdown."" And there is no question that the tier system that was introduced over the autumn, which portioned England into different levels of restrictions, was soon tied up in confusion and regional spats. ""It was completely unintelligible to any normal human being,"" one senior official says. ""It was too slow, and too Byzantine, and that resulted in more cases."" Another says now: ""We ended up tying ourselves into ever tighter knots,"" as the system became more and more particular to each part of the country. It is impossible to know what would have happened if the brakes had been slammed on in September - but some ministers pin the terrible scale of the second wave, at least in part, on the apparent reluctance to act. The circuit-breaker that was imposed later in Wales did not make the problem go away, however. Case numbers weren't the only concern - the economy had been shuttered, and shattered. Political demands had changed. In defence of Mr Johnson, one senior minister says: ""He's not to blame if he was trying to reflect the aspiration for the country back in the summer"". Another tells me the plans, and the billions spent on ""test-and-trace and tiering meant it was reasonable to do the unlock"". They reject the idea that a circuit breaker was the obvious option - ""There wasn't a slam dunk recommendation."" Regarding the potential introduction of national restrictions in September, Downing Street referred us back to comments made by the prime minister to parliament in early November. ""No-one wants to impose measures unless absolutely essential,"" Mr Johnson told the Commons. ""So it made sense to focus initially on the areas where the disease was surging and not to shut businesses, pubs and restaurants in parts of the country where incidence was low."" But while there is no question mistakes were made in the first phase of the pandemic, when so much about the virus was a mystery, those involved in the decisions are already less forgiving of their own mistakes the second time around. ""A miracle,"" is how one minister describes the vaccine gamble to me. A government so often lambasted by critics for busting convention did it again - but this time, so far, with a stunning outcome. Vaccines had been discussed in January, as the government machine began to contemplate, slowly, what might be ahead. Early on the chancellor, holding the cheque book, indicated a willingness to spend at speed, without asking for guarantees. No 10 decided to ""chuck everything at it"", at a meeting in April. With Sir Patrick's crucial experience and deputy chief medical officer for England Prof Jonathan Van-Tam's emphasis on the practicalities of delivering the vaccine, politicians were persuaded to take what was then a huge risk. There was an early decision to ""pay high, pay early, and ensure it works,"" one senior official tells me. And it seems their decision was informed by everything that had gone wrong with trying to secure PPE - the collapse of the NHS's normal procurement process, which is controlled by the Department of Health. The UK decided early not to participate in the EU's joint plan to buy vaccines. While publicly this decision may have been politically controversial, behind closed doors it was ""easy"" and ""straightforward"", ministers and officials say. ""No-one wanted any of the Brexit baggage anywhere near it."" And, more importantly, the EU had made it clear any participating country would be unable to make its own deals with manufacturers the EU had an agreement with - or control its own supply. The vaccines team had warned ministers at the start of May that nothing was certain - and developing a vaccine as quickly as the prime minister, who ""wanted it yesterday"", required would be an uphill struggle. But, as one minister says, it was ""the one thing we would wish that we had done in a year's time"". Another, a senior minister, says: ""The PM strategically saw immediately that the combination of testing, drugs and vaccine was the way out."" And when it came to vaccines, the UK was ready to take an expensive gamble. The Treasury was spending speculatively in ways it had not since the War - and vaccine spending has already reached nearly Â£13.5bn. ""Imagine if it hadn't come off and we had spent all of that taxpayers' money,"" one senior official says to me. There was intense secrecy, throughout, with the various vaccines given secret code names to ensure commercial confidentiality. All were named after submarines - the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine ""Ambush"", I can now reveal, and the Oxford-AstraZeneca ""Triumph"". After 12 months of grappling with endless calculations about balancing risks to life, wider health and how the country makes a living, decision-makers are exhausted. They have to accept it is perfectly possible to be wrong, one senior minister tells me. And those who made the decisions are all too aware mistakes they made in these past 12 months may have had such a terrible cost. Â© 2025 BBC.

"An Abu Dhabi investment fund has agreed to pay Â£800m into UK life sciences, in what could be the first of billions of pounds of investment in the UK. Mubadala, one of the UAE's most active funds, will invest the money over five years. Abu Dhabi is set to invest heavily in British health, tech, green energy and infrastructure,according to the Financial Times,external. It is thought investments in the other sectors will be of a similar scale. The exact size of the total investment is not yet clear, the FT said, but could be worth up to Â£5bn. The UK government said Mubadala's investment in UK life sciences would be ""deployed alongside the UK's Â£200m Life Sciences Investment Programme"", which was announced last year. ""This partnership will enable the UK life sciences sector to develop cutting-edge technologies and research while retaining homegrown innovation and jobs,"" said the UK Minister for Investment, Gerry Grimstone. ""It will also leverage the UK and UAE's mutual priorities in building better and stronger economies through investment.""

The move follows recent news that theUK is creating four regional tradeand investment hubs to boost economic growth across the UK, as well asdropping tariffs on some US goods, put in place over a related dispute about US subsidies to Boeing. Secretary of State for International Trade Liz Truss said on Monday that the hubs would be located in Edinburgh, Cardiff, Belfast and Darlington. The government says the new hubs will provide support and advice to help regional businesses to access major trade markets and boost exports, as part its efforts to boost pandemic recovery. Some experts, however, said that the choice of location was misguided. At the chancellor's recent Budget, emphasis was also placed on investment in the life sciences, clean energy and technology industries.

"The actor Ricky Tomlinson (centre) was one of 24 trade unionists charged with offences including unlawful assembly, conspiracy to intimidate and affray for picketing The Court of Appeal has overturned the convictions of 14 men sentenced for their involvement in pickets in 1972. Trade unionists who picketed during the national builders' strike were charged with offences including unlawful assembly and conspiracy to intimidate. Lawyers for the so-called Shrewsbury 24 had argued the destruction of witness statements made their convictions unsafe. Lord Justice Fulford said ""what occurred was unfair"". The Royle Family star Ricky Tomlinson was among those convicted. He was jailed for two years. Speaking after the verdict, he said: ""It is only right that these convictions are overturned."" Six of the 14 who brought the action have since died, including Dennis Warren, who was jailed for three years. Mr Tomlinson added: ""My thoughts today are with my friend and comrade Des Warren. ""I'm just sorry he is not here today so we can celebrate, but I'm sure he's with us in spirit."" Appellants Terry Renshaw (second left) and John McKinsie Jones (centre) outside the Court of Appeal at a previous hearing Speaking at the Royal Courts of Justice in London, Lord Justice Fulford said: ""These 14 appeals against conviction are allowed across the three trials and on every extant count which the 14 appellants faced."" But he added: ""It would not be in the public interest to order a retrial."" In its written ruling, the Court of Appeal allowed the 14 appellants' appeals on the grounds that original witness statements had been destroyed. In June 1972, trade unionists called the UK's first-ever national builders' strike in protest against pay, unjust employment practices and dangerous conditions on sites. Trade unionists travelled to demonstrate from one site to another and in September six coach-loads of strikers demonstrated in Shrewsbury and Telford. Police arrested none of the demonstrators that day but five months later the picketers were charged and subsequently convicted. Dennis Warren, deceased, and Ricky Tomlinson were among the 14 appellants in the case Lord Justice Fulford wrote: ""If the destruction of the handwritten statements had been revealed to the appellants at the time of the trial, this issue could have been comprehensively investigated with the witnesses when they gave evidence, and the judge would have been able to give appropriate directions. ""We have no doubt that if that had happened, the trial process would have ensured fairness to the accused. Self-evidently, that is not what occurred. ""By the standards of today, what occurred was unfair to the extent that the verdicts cannot be upheld."" Lawyers had argued the broadcast of a documentary about communism during the trials was ""deeply prejudicial"", but the Court of Appeal dismissed the claim that the Red under the Bed documentary might have made the verdicts unsafe. Arthur Murray, who was convicted of affray and unlawful assembly and sentenced to six months, said: ""We were innocent all along, yet it has taken us nearly 50 years to clear our names. ""Sadly my mother and four of my siblings have passed away without knowing that we were innocent. ""Serious questions need to be asked about the role of the building industry bosses in our convictions and the highest offices of government who all had a hand in our trial and conviction. ""Make no mistake, our convictions were a political witch-hunt."" The convictions triggered a massive campaign among left-wing groups during the 1970s Mr Tomlinson, from Liverpool, echoed his remarks, saying: ""We were brought to trial at the apparent behest of the building industry bosses, the Conservative government and ably supported by the secret state. ""This was a political trial not just of me, and the Shrewsbury pickets - but was a trial of the trade union movement.""

She uncovered a document in the National Archives which were part of the prosecution papers and revealed for the first time police had destroyed some of the original witness statements.

"Godzilla vs Kong will fight it out in US cinemas from next month Cineworld has announced it will reopen US cinemas next month, followed by the UK in May, after signing a deal with Warner Bros to show films in theatres before they are streamed. The company will open a handful of its Regal cinemas in the US in early April. Godzilla vs. Kong will be the first film to make its debut in the theatres. Cineworld said the deal with Warner Bros means films will have a period of exclusivity in cinemas before being made more widely available. It follows a row last year when Cineworld and rival AMC, which owns the Odeon Cinemas chain, criticised Universal Pictures for releasing Trolls: World Tour online while theatres were forced to close because of the coronavirus. Both Cineworld and AMC threatened not to show some Universal Pictures films. However, AMC later reached an agreement with Universal where films would first show in theatres for a period before becoming available to rent online. Under its deal with Warner Bros., from next year Cineworld can exclusively show its films for 45 days. In the UK, the period will be 31 days though that can be extended to 45 days for movies ""that open to an agreed upon  box-office threshold"". ""This agreement shows the studio's commitment to the theatrical business and we see this agreement as an important milestone in our 100-year relationship with Warner Bros,"" said Cineworld chief executive Mooky Greidinger. Mortal Kombat will be released in April Godzilla vs. Kong, starring English actress Millie Bobby Brown, will start showing on 2 April in the US in a phased reopening of Cineworld's Regal theatres. It will be followed by Mortal Kombat, the movie based on the hugely popular computer game, on 16 April. The company said it also plans to reopen in the UK - which is its second biggest market - in May, ""in line with current government guidance"". The cinemas now hiring out their screens to gamers The cinema industry has been one of the worst hit sectors during the pandemic with many theatres closed for extended periods or operating at reduced capacity. Global box office takings in 2020 fell by more than 70% from the previous year to $12.4bn, according film technology firm Gower Street Analytics. Dune, starring Zendaya, will now be released in October this year Major releases such as the latest James Bond film, No Time to Die,have been delayed a number of timesbecause of Covid. The much-anticipated sci-fi movie Dune, starring Timothee Chalamet and Zendaya, was originally slated to be released in December 2020, but is now set to premiere in October 2021.

"The decision to introduce new powers compelling Stormont to implement abortion laws has not been taken lightly, Brandon Lewis has said. The government has publishedregulations allowing the NI secretary,externalto direct commissioning of central abortion services in NI. Abortion was decriminalised in 2019, but full services have been stalled. ""We have used every opportunity and avenue to encourage progress,"" said Mr Lewis. Mr Lewis said the government is ""disappointed with the continuing failure to commission abortion services"". He added that the devolution settlement did not absolve the government of its responsibility to uphold the rights of women and girls. ""Our strong preference remains for the Northern Ireland Executive to take responsibility itself for upholding these rights,"" Mr Lewis said. ""It has always been our expectation and preference that the Department of Health would drive forward the commissioning of abortion services."" There has been strong support from 88 MPs across the political divide Earlier the government said giving the NI secretary the powers was a ""necessary and appropriate"" step. The regulations - which come into force on 31 March - state that Mr Lewis isacting as required,externalto uphold legal and human rights duties on NI abortion services. Stormont's Department of Health has said the matter is ""controversial"" and any decision on abortion services must be made by the whole executive. Eighty-eight MPs - including SDLP leader Colum Eastwood, the party's South Belfast MP Claire Hanna and Alliance's Stephen Farry - have offered cross-party support for the NI secretary's move in a letter to Stormont ministers. However, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has criticised it andsaid it would have ""serious consequences""for devolution. In an interview with BBC News NI on Tuesday, North Antrim MP Ian Paisley said a ""dangerous game"" is being played. Mr Paisley said: ""If the government is going to cherry pick elements of theNew Decade, New Approach agreement,external, if it is going to cherry pick other issues and force them on to Northern Ireland, it does not augur well for those of us who may be in a position to influence what matters the Northern Ireland Executive decides to take on next."" The abortion law issue should be removed from the order paper and ""therefore there will be no tit for tat"", he added. Michelle O'Neill says it is ""unfair"" women have been denied access to ""modern and compassionate healthcare services"" Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said it was ""so unfair"" that women have been denied access to ""modern and compassionate healthcare services"". ""It should be this executive that decides and makes sure that we deliver these services,"" Ms O'Neill said. ""I very much urge the health minister to commission the services."" This unusual move by Brandon Lewis can be viewed two ways. Those opposing it have accused London of a power grab, overriding locally-elected ministers on an issue that has been devolved to Stormont for more than a decade. Those in support say the government has an overarching responsibility to ensure the services - already provided for in law by MPs - are set up properly. Limited provision is taking place - more than 1,000 terminations have been carried out here since the laws changed last March. But medical staff involved have been working without direction, resources and no funding meaning not every woman or girl seeking the services, can actually access them. It is this that the government says it's trying to rectify, though Brandon Lewis would undoubtedly still prefer the executive to resolve it. He has effectively placed the parties on notice that he will act if they do not. However, even stronger is the possibility this could all end up being resolved by the courts before the politicians. Alliance Party MLA Paula Bradshaw welcomed the move by Brandon Lewis, but added it should not have been necessary. ""Abortion is a conscience issue for Alliance but this matter is about what should be the first duty of an executive - to ensure the law is implemented properly and fairly,"" Ms Bradshaw said. ""This episode once again shows why fundamental reform of the cross-community veto is long overdue."" Abortion was decriminalised in Northern Ireland in 2019, and changes to NI's abortion laws came into force in March afterWestminster acted during a period when the power-sharing institutions at Stormont were suspended. However, the commissioning of full services has been delayed. Timeline: Abortion in Northern Ireland Stormont and Westminster are facing legal action from the Human Rights Commission over this delay. The regulations provide Mr Lewis with the powers, but they will need to be debated in both houses of Parliament - within 28 sitting days - to remain in force. Latest figures from the Department of Health show that since abortion regulations came into force at the end of March last year, 1,345 terminations have taken place. The department added that full provision of services will require ""substantial additional investment"" from the government. The letter from MPs backing the government's plan was drawn up by Labour MP Stella Creasy,who brought the initial amendment in 2019that led to the changes to Northern Ireland's abortion laws. It is addressed to Stormont's first and deputy first ministers, Arlene Foster and Michelle O'Neill, and Health Minister Robin Swann. It states that it is ""disappointing"" the current laws have not been implemented, and that women and girls in Northern Ireland are entitled to have access to ""safe, legal and local abortion services should they wish to access them"". ""As parliamentarians from many different parties, we respect and value the devolution settlement of the United Kingdom, and are determined it must never be used to deny the human rights of any woman including those of women and girls in Northern Ireland,"" it adds. ""The secretary of state will therefore have our support for this action, and we urge you to commission abortion services urgently."" The changes meant abortionlaws in Northern Ireland altered significantly last year, with terminations available in all circumstances of the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. It is legal in other circumstances up to 24 weeks and beyond that for cases of non-fatal fetal disabilities and fatal fetal abnormalities. At present, health trusts are carrying out interim services for early medical abortions up to 10 weeks, meaning women seeking a termination beyond that are required to travel to England. The Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission is challenging the UK government, the Northern Ireland Executive and NI's Department of Health for delaying the commissioning of all services. Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis has set out new regulations on abortion services in NI The case is due to be heard by Belfast High Court at the end of May. The DUP, which opposed the changes to the abortion laws by Westminster, has proposed a piece of legislation at Stormont seeking to restrict abortions in cases of non-fatal disabilities. Itpassed its second reading last weekwith the support of a number of parties. Sinn FÃ©in abstained on that vote, but has separately called for the Department of Health to commission full abortion services as required under the regulations. The Alliance Party, the SDLP and the Ulster Unionists view the issue as a matter of conscience for individual assembly members. Health Minister Robin Swann has insisted that he, alone, cannot commission abortion services, according to legal advice the executive received from Stormont's Attorney General Brenda King. On Monday, Mr Swann told the assembly that as it was deemed a ""controversial"" matter under the terms of Stormont's ministerial code, he had a duty to ensure any proposals to commission services had consensus of the whole executive. Thecode,externalstates issues which are ""significant or controversial"" must be brought to the executive. Sinn FÃ©in Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey has said she also intends to raise the issue at Thursday's executive meeting.

"Many businesses were closed by the Executives restrictions which began on 26 December Most businesses had no idea they would still be closed one year after the initial Covid-19 lockdown announcement. Some, like pubs that don't serve food for example, have only been open for three weeks of the last 12 months. While the health context has changed with the rollout of a vaccine - many business have the same frustrations. Owners still want a date to re-open and guidelines to know if when they do re-open, they will be able to operate in a way that is viable. The current lockdown restrictions were imposed on 26 December 2020 and have been extended until at least 1 April 2021. Some businesses have criticised the lack of detail in the NI Executive's blueprint for restrictions and in recent weeksthe health minister has said it was too soon to follow a calendar-led approach. Earlier this month,Stormont's Department of Finance released Â£178m in new business support grants. But many businesses say they are worse off financially compared to this time last year, as any cash reserves they may have had will have taken a significant hit. Ed Lindsay is the owner of Finnebrogue Woods wedding venue in Downpatrick, County Down. Ed Lindsay wants indicative dates from the executive so he can make plans Last year he told BBC News NI the first lockdown wiped out his bookings, but now he is still counting the cost. ""If they have to postpone twice, then really we are having to give three weddings and only get the income for one wedding. It has cost us hundreds of thousands of pounds."" He has a message for politicians at Stormont: ""Show some leadership, give us a plan. Give us some indicative dates, please."" Hospitality has been among the hardest hit by restrictions. Fably Khanam is one of the owners of 7 Spice restaurant in Belfast which opened in October - just two days before Northern Ireland entered a second lockdown. She said if they had known they would still be in lockdown now, they would not have opened. The new restaurant marked a significant investment of Â£500,000. What support is there for my NI business? Stormont releases Â£178m in new business grants Now there is a question mark as to whether they will be able to afford to re-open. Fably Khanam says that, for the moment, there is no light at the end of the tunnel She said: ""Because we have no date to re-open, there's no light at the end of the tunnel at the moment. Realistically, there is a possibility that the doors may not open."" ""What funds we have left are just getting little and little - hardly anything's left so it's going to be difficult for us to get through."" Rosaleen Stewart owns a shop called Rosie's Emporium, in Lisburn, and is sitting with thousands of pounds of seasonal stock from Christmas to Mother's Day that she can't sell but still has to pay for. ""It's hard to believe some of this Easter stock is still here from last year,"" she told BBC News NI. Rosaleen Stewart says there is ""no money left in the pot"" ""We are coming up to the end of March and we still don't know what's happening for the rest of this year. ""Easter - we're closed. We still don't know what's happening with the rest of the seasons."" She said she had Christmas and Halloween stock ordered but did not know what was going to happen. ""I had started to build up a cash reserve, that's now everything gone - personal and business wise - there's no money left in the pot,"" she said. Hospitality Ulster, which represents pubs and restaurants in Northern Ireland, is calling on the executive to engage with the industry and publish the criteria which will allow them to reopen. Chief Executive Colin Neill said: ""Why does the health department not want to publish the criteria that must be met to allow us to reopen?"" Many businesses were closed by the Executives restrictions which began on 26 December He added: ""We can't afford just to have doors open and then be severely curtailed and restricted to the point that it's not financially viable. ""Any revenue gained at reopening will only be going towards the offsetting of debt that has been accumulated over the least 12 months and beyond. ""How many more days must we wait without hope? It's now 365 days and counting."" What support is there for my NI business?

"Huw Edwards presented a special event to mark 12 months since the first Covid lockdown was imposed It remembered those who have lost their lives to coronavirus in Wales Thanks were given to the nation's health and care workers for their role in treating those who have fallen ill Wales' political leaders reflected on the pandemic's impact on the nation The National Poet of Wales Ifor ap Glyn wrote a poem for the occasion, inspired by the planting of commemorative woodlands Zara Morgan and Andy Roberts Thank you for joining us for our live coverage of the Wales National Coronavirus Commemorative Event from the Senedd in Cardiff Bay. The programme will be available to watch on demand viathe BBC iPlayerlater this evening. Presiding Officer Elin Jones lays flowers at a coronavirus memorial at the Senedd The commemoration event ends with a pre-recorded video of singer and actress Sophie Evans, from Tonypandy,  performing the Welsh national anthem, Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau. Speaking at the commemorative event in Cardiff, First Minister Mark Drakeford said it had been a year of ""too many sad stories"" but also one of ""determination and bravery"". He said that those who lost their lives during the pandemic will be ""remembered in the hearts and minds of all those who knew and
loved them"". ""This terrible virus has turned all our
lives upside down; disrupting plans, livelihoods and special occasions,"" Mr Drakeford said. ""In the darkest of times, we have come together as a country like
never before. ""This has been a difficult 12 months, but
we can be hopeful the year ahead will bring better and brighter times for us
all,"" he said. The Senedd's presiding officer Elin Jones said there would be ""many opportunities"" for the Senedd ""to reflect on the impact"" of the pandemic in coming months and years. ""Today is an opportunity to show unity and empathy as a
nation, as we have done many times over the year and as we must continue to do
so,"" she said. ""There will be many opportunities for the Senedd
to reflect on the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on all aspects of Welsh
life, and to design our nationâs future."" Especially for the occasion, the National Poet of Wales Ifor ap Glyn has written Dod at ein coed, known in English as Tree sensibility. Mr ap Glyn, who writes in Welsh, said the poem was written in response to the announcement of two woodlands planted as places of reflection, in memory of
those lost during the pandemic. It ends: ""The oaks will soon sail on their seasons, unfurling their glory through churches of green, sieving the sun into the shadows below, and our grief will wear new colours."" Another song from the Morriston Hospital staff choir - the ever-popular Bill Withers classic for people in troubled times, Lean On Me. Senior charge nurse Glenn Sanderson moved into a tent in his garden for eight weeks to protect his family whilst working on a Covid-19 ward at Ysbyty Gwynedd in Bangor. ""I was very scared of bringing the virus home,"" he said. ""I've got three children and a wife and I didn't want to bring it back."" During the first lockdown, carers at the Cherry Tree care home in Coedpoeth, near Wrexham, moved into the premises. ""We had a phone call, two days before to say 'pack your bags, youâre moving in for six weeks', carers Claire Millsip and Clare
Lloyd explained in a short film. âYou were just in there a few hours to sleep and then you
were back up to do your shift the next day."" Deputy manager Joanne
Mannering said: âWe knew it had
to be done to protect all the residents so we just said yes straight away"". A consultant doctor caring for Covid-19 patients in critical care says it was like ""nothing"" he had faced before. Dr Andy Campbell has worked in intensive care in Wrexham Maelor Hospital throughout the pandemic. In a short film about the impact on health services, he said patient numbers increased ""to almost 300% of our normal capacity"" which was ""really
difficult"" for hospital staff. âThe mortality rateâ¦
of those who come to critical care is more around 50%,"" he said. âDealing with that many patients who are critically unwell is nothing like what Iâve had to face before,"" he said. Debanjali says it was ""frightening"" when her husband, a surgeon at the University Hospital of Wales, became ill with Covid-19 symptoms during the pandemic. ""My role as a wife and a mother was constantly switching between being vigilant about him and keeping it calm and relaxed in the house, so the children didn't soak in the fear,"" she said in a short film focusing on Pontprennau Primary School in Cardiff. Debanjali said another parent at the school, a paramedic, obtained special permission from her boss to visit her home to carry out basic medical observations on her husband. ""I will be indebted to her for life for that,"" she said. Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said the past year had seen a ""terrible emptying"" of ""lives hollowed out by grief"". ""Today we map the scale of absence, the empty chair, the voice that used to give us comfort."" He said the year had also been one of ""extraordinary acts of care, by nurses, ambulance crews, care workers, teachers - the list is as long as our debt to them is deep. ""A year on, science, service, and community have delivered us hope,"" he added. Leader of the
Welsh Conservatives Andrew RT Davies said that the ""spirit of kindness"" shown over the past 12 months ""embeds itself"" across whole communities in Wales. ""What we must reflect
on today, are the 7,000 families who havenât got a loved one around the dinner table,
havenât got a visit coming through the door, or that social media message,"" he said on the steps of the Senedd. ""Above all, we will not forget the acts of kindness from our public
sector, the NHS, our carers right across society. ""A new dawn will
come and we will embrace each other again, we will enjoy those kisses but we
will never forgot those who have lost their lives to this virus."" Kidwelly resident Lynda Finch-Jones says she doesn't know how she and her husband Steve would have coped without the volunteering work of town councillor Crisial Davies and supermarket worker Anne Gilley. Ms Finch-Jones cared for her husband during the first lockdown, who was shielding due to being terminally
ill with leukaemia. ""We live in a wonderful place up here...but it's also been a very lonely place,"" she said in a short film telling how the Carmarthenshire town has fared during the pandemic. ""No neighbours, we never see anyone."" Ms Finch-Jones said it was a ""highlight"" to see someone every week when they dropped off shopping supplies to them. ""Angels live around here, there are some true angels here."" Hospital health workers and staff from Morriston Hospital in Swansea joined forces to perform a rendition of Ar Hyd y Nos (All
Through the Night). Matron Andrea Bradley said it was ""an honour and a privilege"" to sing in memory of those who had died. Also featured in the film about bereavement is Natalie Power, whose father Barry died from Covid-19 in October last year. ""Iâll never
ever be able to forget or forgive this whole pandemic for taking my dad,"" she says. ""It was an undignified
way to die. He died alone in hospital â we werenât able to be with him."" Ms Power planted a tree in his memory, which will become part of a woodland created to serve as aliving memorial to those who lost their livesdue to the pandemic. The event begins with a short film in which two women share their experiences of bereavement as a result of coronavirus. Andrea Williams, from Sully, Vale of Glamorgan, says she never got to say a final goodbye to her husband Mark, 58, who died at the start of the pandemic. ""We did so much
together and we had so much more we wanted to do, we were living our best life,"" she says. ""He was absolutely everything to me. ""Not to have
had that final conversation... even if it is just to say I love you."" Ms Williams has since helped set up the Covid-19 Families Wales group -which supports about 1,300 people who have lost loved ones,external. The Wales National Coronavirus Commemoration is under way in Cardiff. Introducing the event, BBC News presenter Huw Edwards says that the past year has ""changed our lives"". ""Itâs forced many to reassess whatâs important in life â and
to reach out to the lonely and vulnerable. ""In this event, we
will hear from those on the front line. Itâs the nationâs opportunity to say
thank you,"" he said. This video can not be played Covid: Mountain's heart-shaped tribute to lives lost People in Treorchy have formed a stone heart-shaped memorial with yellow flags on the Bwlch mountain to commemorate those who have died with Covid. On each flag is the name and date of birth of a person who has died. It was originally started by Bev Johnson for those who had died in Rhondda Cynon Taf, after losing her mother Sheila in January.

"David Solomon promised to enforce a rule that ensured young bankers didn't work on Saturdays The chief executive of Goldman Sachs says it's ""great"" a group of young analysts raised concerns about working conditions at the investment firm. A group of 13 US employees mocked up a presentation in which they told of 95-hour working weeks and ""inhumane"" conditions amounting to abuse. Boss David Solomon said in a message: ""It's great that this group of analysts went to their management."" But he added that going an ""extra mile"" can make a big difference for the bank. In his address to the investment bank's 34,000 staff worldwide, Mr Solomon said he expected Goldman to continue to face high demand from clients and emphasised the need to meet the challenge, saying hard work brought rewards. ""Just remember: if we all go an extra mile for our client, even when we feel that we're reaching our limit, it can really make a difference in our performance,"" he said. The analysts sent their complaints to bosses in February, but it only became public last week. Citi boss Jane Fraser has introduced Zoom-free Fridays. Mr Solomon said: ""We want a workplace where people can share concerns freely... If there are any issues, do not hesitate to reach out to ask for help.""

"Huw Edwards presented a special event to mark 12 months since the first Covid lockdown was imposed It remembered those who have lost their lives to coronavirus in Wales Thanks were given to the nation's health and care workers for their role in treating those who have fallen ill Wales' political leaders reflected on the pandemic's impact on the nation The National Poet of Wales Ifor ap Glyn wrote a poem for the occasion, inspired by the planting of commemorative woodlands Zara Morgan and Andy Roberts Thank you for joining us for our live coverage of the Wales National Coronavirus Commemorative Event from the Senedd in Cardiff Bay. The programme will be available to watch on demand viathe BBC iPlayerlater this evening. Presiding Officer Elin Jones lays flowers at a coronavirus memorial at the Senedd The commemoration event ends with a pre-recorded video of singer and actress Sophie Evans, from Tonypandy,  performing the Welsh national anthem, Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau. Speaking at the commemorative event in Cardiff, First Minister Mark Drakeford said it had been a year of ""too many sad stories"" but also one of ""determination and bravery"". He said that those who lost their lives during the pandemic will be ""remembered in the hearts and minds of all those who knew and
loved them"". ""This terrible virus has turned all our
lives upside down; disrupting plans, livelihoods and special occasions,"" Mr Drakeford said. ""In the darkest of times, we have come together as a country like
never before. ""This has been a difficult 12 months, but
we can be hopeful the year ahead will bring better and brighter times for us
all,"" he said. The Senedd's presiding officer Elin Jones said there would be ""many opportunities"" for the Senedd ""to reflect on the impact"" of the pandemic in coming months and years. ""Today is an opportunity to show unity and empathy as a
nation, as we have done many times over the year and as we must continue to do
so,"" she said. ""There will be many opportunities for the Senedd
to reflect on the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on all aspects of Welsh
life, and to design our nationâs future."" Especially for the occasion, the National Poet of Wales Ifor ap Glyn has written Dod at ein coed, known in English as Tree sensibility. Mr ap Glyn, who writes in Welsh, said the poem was written in response to the announcement of two woodlands planted as places of reflection, in memory of
those lost during the pandemic. It ends: ""The oaks will soon sail on their seasons, unfurling their glory through churches of green, sieving the sun into the shadows below, and our grief will wear new colours."" Another song from the Morriston Hospital staff choir - the ever-popular Bill Withers classic for people in troubled times, Lean On Me. Senior charge nurse Glenn Sanderson moved into a tent in his garden for eight weeks to protect his family whilst working on a Covid-19 ward at Ysbyty Gwynedd in Bangor. ""I was very scared of bringing the virus home,"" he said. ""I've got three children and a wife and I didn't want to bring it back."" During the first lockdown, carers at the Cherry Tree care home in Coedpoeth, near Wrexham, moved into the premises. ""We had a phone call, two days before to say 'pack your bags, youâre moving in for six weeks', carers Claire Millsip and Clare
Lloyd explained in a short film. âYou were just in there a few hours to sleep and then you
were back up to do your shift the next day."" Deputy manager Joanne
Mannering said: âWe knew it had
to be done to protect all the residents so we just said yes straight away"". A consultant doctor caring for Covid-19 patients in critical care says it was like ""nothing"" he had faced before. Dr Andy Campbell has worked in intensive care in Wrexham Maelor Hospital throughout the pandemic. In a short film about the impact on health services, he said patient numbers increased ""to almost 300% of our normal capacity"" which was ""really
difficult"" for hospital staff. âThe mortality rateâ¦
of those who come to critical care is more around 50%,"" he said. âDealing with that many patients who are critically unwell is nothing like what Iâve had to face before,"" he said. Debanjali says it was ""frightening"" when her husband, a surgeon at the University Hospital of Wales, became ill with Covid-19 symptoms during the pandemic. ""My role as a wife and a mother was constantly switching between being vigilant about him and keeping it calm and relaxed in the house, so the children didn't soak in the fear,"" she said in a short film focusing on Pontprennau Primary School in Cardiff. Debanjali said another parent at the school, a paramedic, obtained special permission from her boss to visit her home to carry out basic medical observations on her husband. ""I will be indebted to her for life for that,"" she said. Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said the past year had seen a ""terrible emptying"" of ""lives hollowed out by grief"". ""Today we map the scale of absence, the empty chair, the voice that used to give us comfort."" He said the year had also been one of ""extraordinary acts of care, by nurses, ambulance crews, care workers, teachers - the list is as long as our debt to them is deep. ""A year on, science, service, and community have delivered us hope,"" he added. Leader of the
Welsh Conservatives Andrew RT Davies said that the ""spirit of kindness"" shown over the past 12 months ""embeds itself"" across whole communities in Wales. ""What we must reflect
on today, are the 7,000 families who havenât got a loved one around the dinner table,
havenât got a visit coming through the door, or that social media message,"" he said on the steps of the Senedd. ""Above all, we will not forget the acts of kindness from our public
sector, the NHS, our carers right across society. ""A new dawn will
come and we will embrace each other again, we will enjoy those kisses but we
will never forgot those who have lost their lives to this virus."" Kidwelly resident Lynda Finch-Jones says she doesn't know how she and her husband Steve would have coped without the volunteering work of town councillor Crisial Davies and supermarket worker Anne Gilley. Ms Finch-Jones cared for her husband during the first lockdown, who was shielding due to being terminally
ill with leukaemia. ""We live in a wonderful place up here...but it's also been a very lonely place,"" she said in a short film telling how the Carmarthenshire town has fared during the pandemic. ""No neighbours, we never see anyone."" Ms Finch-Jones said it was a ""highlight"" to see someone every week when they dropped off shopping supplies to them. ""Angels live around here, there are some true angels here."" Hospital health workers and staff from Morriston Hospital in Swansea joined forces to perform a rendition of Ar Hyd y Nos (All
Through the Night). Matron Andrea Bradley said it was ""an honour and a privilege"" to sing in memory of those who had died. Also featured in the film about bereavement is Natalie Power, whose father Barry died from Covid-19 in October last year. ""Iâll never
ever be able to forget or forgive this whole pandemic for taking my dad,"" she says. ""It was an undignified
way to die. He died alone in hospital â we werenât able to be with him."" Ms Power planted a tree in his memory, which will become part of a woodland created to serve as aliving memorial to those who lost their livesdue to the pandemic. The event begins with a short film in which two women share their experiences of bereavement as a result of coronavirus. Andrea Williams, from Sully, Vale of Glamorgan, says she never got to say a final goodbye to her husband Mark, 58, who died at the start of the pandemic. ""We did so much
together and we had so much more we wanted to do, we were living our best life,"" she says. ""He was absolutely everything to me. ""Not to have
had that final conversation... even if it is just to say I love you."" Ms Williams has since helped set up the Covid-19 Families Wales group -which supports about 1,300 people who have lost loved ones,external. The Wales National Coronavirus Commemoration is under way in Cardiff. Introducing the event, BBC News presenter Huw Edwards says that the past year has ""changed our lives"". ""Itâs forced many to reassess whatâs important in life â and
to reach out to the lonely and vulnerable. ""In this event, we
will hear from those on the front line. Itâs the nationâs opportunity to say
thank you,"" he said. This video can not be played Covid: Mountain's heart-shaped tribute to lives lost People in Treorchy have formed a stone heart-shaped memorial with yellow flags on the Bwlch mountain to commemorate those who have died with Covid. On each flag is the name and date of birth of a person who has died. It was originally started by Bev Johnson for those who had died in Rhondda Cynon Taf, after losing her mother Sheila in January.

"David Solomon promised to enforce a rule that ensured young bankers didn't work on Saturdays The chief executive of Goldman Sachs says it's ""great"" a group of young analysts raised concerns about working conditions at the investment firm. A group of 13 US employees mocked up a presentation in which they told of 95-hour working weeks and ""inhumane"" conditions amounting to abuse. Boss David Solomon said in a message: ""It's great that this group of analysts went to their management."" But he added that going an ""extra mile"" can make a big difference for the bank. In his address to the investment bank's 34,000 staff worldwide, Mr Solomon said he expected Goldman to continue to face high demand from clients and emphasised the need to meet the challenge, saying hard work brought rewards. ""Just remember: if we all go an extra mile for our client, even when we feel that we're reaching our limit, it can really make a difference in our performance,"" he said. The analysts sent their complaints to bosses in February, but it only became public last week. Citi boss Jane Fraser has introduced Zoom-free Fridays.

"The decision to introduce new powers compelling Stormont to implement abortion laws has not been taken lightly, Brandon Lewis has said. The government has publishedregulations allowing the NI secretary,externalto direct commissioning of central abortion services in NI. Abortion was decriminalised in 2019, but full services have been stalled. ""We have used every opportunity and avenue to encourage progress,"" said Mr Lewis. Mr Lewis said the government is ""disappointed with the continuing failure to commission abortion services"". He added that the devolution settlement did not absolve the government of its responsibility to uphold the rights of women and girls. ""Our strong preference remains for the Northern Ireland Executive to take responsibility itself for upholding these rights,"" Mr Lewis said. ""It has always been our expectation and preference that the Department of Health would drive forward the commissioning of abortion services."" There has been strong support from 88 MPs across the political divide Earlier the government said giving the NI secretary the powers was a ""necessary and appropriate"" step. The regulations - which come into force on 31 March - state that Mr Lewis isacting as required,externalto uphold legal and human rights duties on NI abortion services. Stormont's Department of Health has said the matter is ""controversial"" and any decision on abortion services must be made by the whole executive. Eighty-eight MPs - including SDLP leader Colum Eastwood, the party's South Belfast MP Claire Hanna and Alliance's Stephen Farry - have offered cross-party support for the NI secretary's move in a letter to Stormont ministers. However, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has criticised it andsaid it would have ""serious consequences""for devolution. In an interview with BBC News NI on Tuesday, North Antrim MP Ian Paisley said a ""dangerous game"" is being played. Mr Paisley said: ""If the government is going to cherry pick elements of theNew Decade, New Approach agreement,external, if it is going to cherry pick other issues and force them on to Northern Ireland, it does not augur well for those of us who may be in a position to influence what matters the Northern Ireland Executive decides to take on next."" The abortion law issue should be removed from the order paper and ""therefore there will be no tit for tat"", he added. Michelle O'Neill says it is ""unfair"" women have been denied access to ""modern and compassionate healthcare services"" Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said it was ""so unfair"" that women have been denied access to ""modern and compassionate healthcare services"". ""It should be this executive that decides and makes sure that we deliver these services,"" Ms O'Neill said. ""I very much urge the health minister to commission the services."" This unusual move by Brandon Lewis can be viewed two ways. Those opposing it have accused London of a power grab, overriding locally-elected ministers on an issue that has been devolved to Stormont for more than a decade. Those in support say the government has an overarching responsibility to ensure the services - already provided for in law by MPs - are set up properly. Limited provision is taking place - more than 1,000 terminations have been carried out here since the laws changed last March. But medical staff involved have been working without direction, resources and no funding meaning not every woman or girl seeking the services, can actually access them. It is this that the government says it's trying to rectify, though Brandon Lewis would undoubtedly still prefer the executive to resolve it. He has effectively placed the parties on notice that he will act if they do not. However, even stronger is the possibility this could all end up being resolved by the courts before the politicians. Alliance Party MLA Paula Bradshaw welcomed the move by Brandon Lewis, but added it should not have been necessary. ""Abortion is a conscience issue for Alliance but this matter is about what should be the first duty of an executive - to ensure the law is implemented properly and fairly,"" Ms Bradshaw said. ""This episode once again shows why fundamental reform of the cross-community veto is long overdue."" Abortion was decriminalised in Northern Ireland in 2019, and changes to NI's abortion laws came into force in March afterWestminster acted during a period when the power-sharing institutions at Stormont were suspended. However, the commissioning of full services has been delayed. Timeline: Abortion in Northern Ireland Stormont and Westminster are facing legal action from the Human Rights Commission over this delay. The regulations provide Mr Lewis with the powers, but they will need to be debated in both houses of Parliament - within 28 sitting days - to remain in force. Latest figures from the Department of Health show that since abortion regulations came into force at the end of March last year, 1,345 terminations have taken place. The department added that full provision of services will require ""substantial additional investment"" from the government. The letter from MPs backing the government's plan was drawn up by Labour MP Stella Creasy,who brought the initial amendment in 2019that led to the changes to Northern Ireland's abortion laws. It is addressed to Stormont's first and deputy first ministers, Arlene Foster and Michelle O'Neill, and Health Minister Robin Swann. It states that it is ""disappointing"" the current laws have not been implemented, and that women and girls in Northern Ireland are entitled to have access to ""safe, legal and local abortion services should they wish to access them"". ""As parliamentarians from many different parties, we respect and value the devolution settlement of the United Kingdom, and are determined it must never be used to deny the human rights of any woman including those of women and girls in Northern Ireland,"" it adds. ""The secretary of state will therefore have our support for this action, and we urge you to commission abortion services urgently."" The changes meant abortionlaws in Northern Ireland altered significantly last year, with terminations available in all circumstances of the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. It is legal in other circumstances up to 24 weeks and beyond that for cases of non-fatal fetal disabilities and fatal fetal abnormalities. At present, health trusts are carrying out interim services for early medical abortions up to 10 weeks, meaning women seeking a termination beyond that are required to travel to England. The Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission is challenging the UK government, the Northern Ireland Executive and NI's Department of Health for delaying the commissioning of all services. Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis has set out new regulations on abortion services in NI The case is due to be heard by Belfast High Court at the end of May. The DUP, which opposed the changes to the abortion laws by Westminster, has proposed a piece of legislation at Stormont seeking to restrict abortions in cases of non-fatal disabilities. Itpassed its second reading last weekwith the support of a number of parties. Sinn FÃ©in abstained on that vote, but has separately called for the Department of Health to commission full abortion services as required under the regulations. The Alliance Party, the SDLP and the Ulster Unionists view the issue as a matter of conscience for individual assembly members. Health Minister Robin Swann has insisted that he, alone, cannot commission abortion services, according to legal advice the executive received from Stormont's Attorney General Brenda King. On Monday, Mr Swann told the assembly that as it was deemed a ""controversial"" matter under the terms of Stormont's ministerial code, he had a duty to ensure any proposals to commission services had consensus of the whole executive. Thecode,externalstates issues which are ""significant or controversial"" must be brought to the executive. Sinn FÃ©in Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey has said she also intends to raise the issue at Thursday's executive meeting.

"The number of workers on company payrolls in the UK climbed by almost 200,000 in the three months to February, amid signs that the jobs market may be stabilising. However, the number on payrolls is still 693,000 lower than last February, before Covid lockdown measures began. It comes amid growing optimism that the vaccine rollout will lead to a faster-than-expected economic recovery. Theofficial unemployment rate now stands at 5%,external, down from 5.1% before. Sam Beckett, head of economic statistics at the Office for National Statistics, told the BBC's Today programme there was still a lot of uncertainty in the jobs market. She added that people aged under 25 continued to bear the brunt of the job losses. ""Furlough is still doing a lot of heavy lifting in the labour market. There are around five million people still on furlough, it's down from its peak of nine million but has been rising recently. ""But you have to remember the underlying picture is that close to 700,000 people have come off the payroll since the start of the pandemic so there has been a large fall in employment since the start ""Around two-thirds of the fall is under-25s. London has been particularly hard hit."" How many people could lose their jobs? UK outlook 'uncertain' despite vaccine, says Bank The latest figures cover a period when most parts of the UK entered strict lockdowns. However, the number of workers on payroll increased for the third month in a row in February, the ONS said. The number of redundancies across the UK also fell slightly to 11 per 1,000 people in January - down from 14 per 1,000 two months previously. Despite this, the ONS said the jobs crisis remained acute, with 1.7 million people out of work - around a five-year high. This video can not be played ""People aged 50-plus are finding they are being overlooked"" It said the hospitality and retail industries had been hit particularly hard, with a total of 491,000 payroll jobs lost across both sectors since the pandemic began. Nonetheless, commentators said they believed the worst may soon be over as the vaccine programme gradually allows the UK economy to reopen. ""Overall, we think employment is getting close to its trough,"" said Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics. ""We still expect the unemployment rate to rise to 6% by early 2022, but the bulk of that will be driven by those who left the labour force returning, rather than people losing their jobs."" It echoes projections from the government's fiscal watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, which has forecast that the unemployment rate will peak at 6.5% this year instead of the 11.9% predicted last July. Unemployment stayed generally stable in January despite further national lockdowns. On some weekly or monthly measures, joblessness actually fell a little to just below 5%, despite the compulsory closure of large swathes of the hospitality industry at the beginning of the year. This is thanks to two factors - the fact that five million people are on the furlough scheme and the fact that employers have become better adapted to lockdowns. The ONS also tried to assess just how many foreign workers left the UK last year. While some estimates had put the fall at over one million, the ONS suggested the fall was around 180,000, or the same as the population of the city of Portsmouth. That is entirely the result of EU workers leaving the UK. The number of non-EU workers actually increased a little during the pandemic. Becky O'Connor, head of pensions and savings at Interactive Investor, said the latest data showed ""chinks of light"" but that the impact of the crisis would be felt for some time to come. ""Even as work opportunities return, people who have lost their jobs or part of their income will need continued support as the economy opens back up. ""If the doors to work reopen for those people, their decimated personal finances from a year of lost income will take far longer to get back off the ground.""

"The decision to introduce new powers compelling Stormont to implement abortion laws has not been taken lightly, Brandon Lewis has said. The government has publishedregulations allowing the NI secretary,externalto direct commissioning of central abortion services in NI. Abortion was decriminalised in 2019, but full services have been stalled. ""We have used every opportunity and avenue to encourage progress,"" said Mr Lewis. Mr Lewis said the government is ""disappointed with the continuing failure to commission abortion services"". He added that the devolution settlement did not absolve the government of its responsibility to uphold the rights of women and girls. ""Our strong preference remains for the Northern Ireland Executive to take responsibility itself for upholding these rights,"" Mr Lewis said. ""It has always been our expectation and preference that the Department of Health would drive forward the commissioning of abortion services."" There has been strong support from 88 MPs across the political divide Earlier the government said giving the NI secretary the powers was a ""necessary and appropriate"" step. The regulations - which come into force on 31 March - state that Mr Lewis isacting as required,externalto uphold legal and human rights duties on NI abortion services. Stormont's Department of Health has said the matter is ""controversial"" and any decision on abortion services must be made by the whole executive. Eighty-eight MPs - including SDLP leader Colum Eastwood, the party's South Belfast MP Claire Hanna and Alliance's Stephen Farry - have offered cross-party support for the NI secretary's move in a letter to Stormont ministers. However, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has criticised it andsaid it would have ""serious consequences""for devolution. In an interview with BBC News NI on Tuesday, North Antrim MP Ian Paisley said a ""dangerous game"" is being played. Mr Paisley said: ""If the government is going to cherry pick elements of theNew Decade, New Approach agreement,external, if it is going to cherry pick other issues and force them on to Northern Ireland, it does not augur well for those of us who may be in a position to influence what matters the Northern Ireland Executive decides to take on next."" The abortion law issue should be removed from the order paper and ""therefore there will be no tit for tat"", he added. Michelle O'Neill says it is ""unfair"" women have been denied access to ""modern and compassionate healthcare services"" Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said it was ""so unfair"" that women have been denied access to ""modern and compassionate healthcare services"". ""It should be this executive that decides and makes sure that we deliver these services,"" Ms O'Neill said. ""I very much urge the health minister to commission the services."" This unusual move by Brandon Lewis can be viewed two ways. Those opposing it have accused London of a power grab, overriding locally-elected ministers on an issue that has been devolved to Stormont for more than a decade. Those in support say the government has an overarching responsibility to ensure the services - already provided for in law by MPs - are set up properly. Limited provision is taking place - more than 1,000 terminations have been carried out here since the laws changed last March. But medical staff involved have been working without direction, resources and no funding meaning not every woman or girl seeking the services, can actually access them. It is this that the government says it's trying to rectify, though Brandon Lewis would undoubtedly still prefer the executive to resolve it. He has effectively placed the parties on notice that he will act if they do not. However, even stronger is the possibility this could all end up being resolved by the courts before the politicians. Alliance Party MLA Paula Bradshaw welcomed the move by Brandon Lewis, but added it should not have been necessary. ""Abortion is a conscience issue for Alliance but this matter is about what should be the first duty of an executive - to ensure the law is implemented properly and fairly,"" Ms Bradshaw said. ""This episode once again shows why fundamental reform of the cross-community veto is long overdue."" Abortion was decriminalised in Northern Ireland in 2019, and changes to NI's abortion laws came into force in March afterWestminster acted during a period when the power-sharing institutions at Stormont were suspended. However, the commissioning of full services has been delayed. Timeline: Abortion in Northern Ireland Stormont and Westminster are facing legal action from the Human Rights Commission over this delay. The regulations provide Mr Lewis with the powers, but they will need to be debated in both houses of Parliament - within 28 sitting days - to remain in force. Latest figures from the Department of Health show that since abortion regulations came into force at the end of March last year, 1,345 terminations have taken place. The department added that full provision of services will require ""substantial additional investment"" from the government. The letter from MPs backing the government's plan was drawn up by Labour MP Stella Creasy,who brought the initial amendment in 2019that led to the changes to Northern Ireland's abortion laws. It is addressed to Stormont's first and deputy first ministers, Arlene Foster and Michelle O'Neill, and Health Minister Robin Swann. It states that it is ""disappointing"" the current laws have not been implemented, and that women and girls in Northern Ireland are entitled to have access to ""safe, legal and local abortion services should they wish to access them"". ""As parliamentarians from many different parties, we respect and value the devolution settlement of the United Kingdom, and are determined it must never be used to deny the human rights of any woman including those of women and girls in Northern Ireland,"" it adds. ""The secretary of state will therefore have our support for this action, and we urge you to commission abortion services urgently."" The changes meant abortionlaws in Northern Ireland altered significantly last year, with terminations available in all circumstances of the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. It is legal in other circumstances up to 24 weeks and beyond that for cases of non-fatal fetal disabilities and fatal fetal abnormalities. At present, health trusts are carrying out interim services for early medical abortions up to 10 weeks, meaning women seeking a termination beyond that are required to travel to England. The Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission is challenging the UK government, the Northern Ireland Executive and NI's Department of Health for delaying the commissioning of all services. Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis has set out new regulations on abortion services in NI The case is due to be heard by Belfast High Court at the end of May. The DUP, which opposed the changes to the abortion laws by Westminster, has proposed a piece of legislation at Stormont seeking to restrict abortions in cases of non-fatal disabilities. Itpassed its second reading last weekwith the support of a number of parties. Sinn FÃ©in abstained on that vote, but has separately called for the Department of Health to commission full abortion services as required under the regulations. The Alliance Party, the SDLP and the Ulster Unionists view the issue as a matter of conscience for individual assembly members. Health Minister Robin Swann has insisted that he, alone, cannot commission abortion services, according to legal advice the executive received from Stormont's Attorney General Brenda King. On Monday, Mr Swann told the assembly that as it was deemed a ""controversial"" matter under the terms of Stormont's ministerial code, he had a duty to ensure any proposals to commission services had consensus of the whole executive. Thecode,externalstates issues which are ""significant or controversial"" must be brought to the executive. Sinn FÃ©in Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey has said she also intends to raise the issue at Thursday's executive meeting.

"Covid-19 has shaken the world, with more than 2.5 million deaths and 115 million cases confirmed. BBC Panorama's Jane Corbin has scoured the globe to find the best examples of strategies for combating the virus. I have reported on Covid for the past year - now my mission was to find out from global leaders and senior health officials across four continents what their priorities were in tackling the virus. What has emerged strongly for me are four key areas which have been most effective in containing the spread of the virus and preventing deaths. Early and effective action to control borders and monitoring of arrivals Testing, tracking and tracing everyone suspected of being infected Welfare support for those in quarantine to contain the virus Effective leadership and consistent and timely public messaging No-one can claim to have got everything right. But the steps listed below highlight some policies from around the world that have proved effective. Piece them together and you have the blueprint for a ""pandemic playbook"" - a manual for managing future infectious disease outbreaks. Stanley Park lives in Seoul, South Korea. When he went to pick up his daughter, Joo Yeon, from the airport, he greeted her not with a hug but with a mask and a bottle of sanitising spray. For Stanley, this isn't his first experience of a pandemic. He remembers the devastation and fear thatthe Mers outbreakbrought to east Asia in 2015. It's an experience his country has learned from, with the government making 48 reforms to bolster public-health emergency preparedness and response. These have paid off. When coronavirus hit, officials were able to flatten the epidemic curve quickly, without closing businesses or implementing stricter stay-at-home restrictions nationally. After her arrival from Atlanta, Joo Yeon completed a strict two-week quarantine at her parents' house, downloaded an app that tracks her movements and received six check-up calls from the authorities. She took her quarantine so seriously that she ""didn't even go to the garden, just in case"". ""From the very start we put in place thorough prevention measures to stop the same thing happening again - history repeating itself,"" Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun said. ""It's very challenging at the moment, I have no idea if the patients I see have coronavirus or not,"" David Hodges, a GP from north-east England, told Panorama in March 2020. ""We might have hundreds of cases we're missing."" As cases soared ahead of the first lockdown in late March, and with resources stretched, the UK government, which had been conducting contact tracing until this point, stopped testing in the community. It had the capacity to test only in hospitals. The government's formal test-and-trace programme was launched in May. Coronavirus testing booths were set up outside Yangii hospital in Seoul, South Korea Most countries in east Asia started contact tracing in January. In South Korea, hospitals like Yangji, in the Gwan-Ak district of Seoul, were designated to handle Covid from testing to treatment. Here, people don't even need to enter the building - they're tested at arm's-length in a special fully-sealed booth. The hospital processes all its own tests on site and the results are usually available within four or five hours. In the UK it can take a day or more. Down the road from the hospital, a track-and-trace team follows up on every suspected case. The team can be forensic with the detail and has access to credit card and mobile phone data. It monitors CCTV throughout the district, sending teams out into the community to scour the streets when it sees something that concerns it. Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun took personal charge of the situation before the country even had a confirmed case of Covid, giving priority to the three Ts - test, track and trace. ""By applying that strategy we've achieved a good, meaningful result,"" Mr Sye-kyun has said. The death toll in South Korea, a country of 52 million people, stands at 1,693. How does the test-and-trace system work in the UK? The UK government says the testing system has continued to evolve and it is doing everything it can to improve it. ""Making people stay at home is the main reason we've been able to contain Covid,"" says Usha Kumari, a community health worker in Kerala, India. Usha is one of 30,000 accredited social-health activists, known as Asha workers. Usha's role has been to ensure everyone who needs to self-isolate in her patch does so. She gets their shopping, collects their medicine and anything they might need, so that they don't leave their homes. The support for those isolating doesn't end there. Community kitchens have been supplying up to 600 free meals to people self-isolating at home or in hospital each day and mental-health services have been offered since the start of the pandemic. Financial aid has been provided and, in some cases, bills were temporarily frozen. In the UK it wasn't until September that a payment of Â£500 was offered to those self-isolating. However, in the first four months of the UK scheme, two-thirds of applicants were rejected. According to aScientific Advice Group for Emergencies report,externalreleased in September, less than 20% of people in the UK who were required to self-isolate, fully quarantined. How many people are being paid to self-isolate? Now, the UK government's expanding eligibility for the support payment. It says four million people could qualify. Kerala's health minister KK Shailaja learned important lessons three years ago dealing with the deadly Nipah virus and has applied those lessons to tackling Covid. She insists that by ensuring support for those self-isolating, officials were able to control the spread and keep its hospitals from being overwhelmed. With a population of 35 million, Kerala went from having the highest number of cases in India in March 2020 to having among the lowest Covid-19 death rates in the world. At the start of April, GP Lisa Federle began testing in care homes in the ancient town of TÃ¼bingen, in the Baden WÃ¼rttemberg state of Germany, to keep the virus out and to allow visitors. GP Lisa Federle began testing in care homes in the ancient town of TÃ¼bingen in April The town's mayor, Boris Palmer, thought ""we have to build up a special protection shield for the people who carry the highest risk"". He had seen the impact of the virus in Italy and Spain on the older demographic. ""These are the elderly people, so we need special protection for them."" Mr Palmer used his local budget to prioritise care and support for the town's elderly population, including a subsidised taxi service, free masks delivered to homes and special shopping hours. It meant the town's University Hospital, received fewer Covid-19 patients and wasn't forced to cancel other medical procedures. This video can not be played The son of an elderly man in Sweden told BBC Panorama his father ""was left to die"" after he tested positive for Covid What are the care home visiting rules in England? Unlike the UK, where London, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast made all the major decisions, Germany, with its federal system, allowed each of its states to decide locally how to respond to the virus. The elderly have been among the largest casualties of the pandemic - and, particularly in Europe, those living in care homes. Although visitors were banned in UK care homes right at the start, there was criticism that testing was slow. It wasn't until 15 April that it was announced by the UK government that all people discharged from hospitals into care homes needed to have a test. By July, at least 20,000 care-home residents in England and Wales had died from Covid-19 since the start of the outbreak, according to the Office for National Statistics. ""When it comes to nursing homes, they're a vulnerable group and that should not have been a surprise,"" says Prof Dale Fisher, an expert in infectious diseases who was sent to the epicentre of the outbreak in Wuhan, China, in February 2020. ""I think it's been obvious where in the world nursing homes weren't given attention, the death tolls there were significant."" More than 26 million people in the UK have received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine - part of the biggest inoculation programme the country has ever launched. While well behind world leader Israel, which has so far fully inoculated more than half its population, the UK has had extraordinary success with its vaccine programme. More than 24 million people in the UK have received one dose of a coronavirus vaccine The UK's success is largely down to a tremendous effort in planning. The Department of Health and Social Care began planning a mass vaccination programme before there was even confirmation of the first Covid-19 case in the UK. In the summer, the government signed a contract for 100 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and 30 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.       Source: Our World in Data  It's a different story in Europe - planning started later and the rollout has been slow. Only 8% of people in Europe have received a vaccine so far compared with 36% in the UK. The UK's vaccine deals were struck three months before the EU's. Who is the woman who designed the Oxford vaccine? Vaccine pause hits Europe rollout as Covid cases rise The situation is worse across the developing world. While nearly all of Europe and the Americas have begun vaccination campaigns, only a handful of African countries have. Many poorer countries are relying on deliveries from Covax In South Africa's Cape Town, Michael Kuta is one of the many people in the townships who volunteered to take part in a trial run by Dr Linda Gail-Bekker for the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. Michael doesn't know whether he has received the vaccine or a placebo, but he says, for him, its worth it. ""It's the only chance that I have to get the injection for the pandemic. To live,"" he says. ""My family still need me."" Many poorer countries are relying on deliveries from Covax, a scheme led by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, which aims to ensure access for all to Covid vaccines. The UK is one of the largest contributors, donating nearly Â£500m. South Africa has signed up to the initiative. However, a vaccination strategy must be an international effort. In countries where access to a vaccine is limited, the virus has an opportunity to mutate - as it has in South Africa and Brazil - creating new variants that are more transmissible, which can spread abroad. Scientists fear they could be more resistant to existing vaccines and therefore threaten countries that have had a successful rollout. The UK government says there'll be opportunities to look back, analyse and reflect. There will be an independent inquiry - at the appropriate time. But for now it is focused entirely on the pandemic, which has challenged health systems across the world. As work continues to distribute the vaccine globally, it appears we have finally turned a corner in our fight against the Covid-19 pandemic. Prof Dale Fisher says we cannot risk not learning the lessons of the last 12 months. ""We've been hit hard and paid a hefty price. One of the worst things we can do is when this is over, we just go back to normal. If you don't learn from it, then history will repeat itself.""

"At the beginning of March 2020, I asked a senior member of the government: ""Do you feel worried?"" They replied: ""Personally? No."" But just weeks later, Downing Street was scrambling to manage the biggest crisis since World War Two. Since then, monumental decisions have had to be taken. And there have been many accusations of failings - the desperate shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE), Covid ripping through unprepared care homes, hundreds of billions borrowed and spent to keep the economy going, to name a few. I have asked 20 of the most senior politicians, officials and former officials, who either witnessed or were involved in the big decisions, to pick five pivotal moments from the past 12 months. What they say tells us so much about what really happened, what our leaders were thinking, and, strikingly, how little they knew. The contributors are not being named, so they could speak freely. On 31 January, it was reported that coronavirus had arrived in the UK, as two people were admitted to hospital. Meanwhile, more than 80 Britons evacuated from China were quarantined at a facility in the north-west of England. But for the government, Brexit had sucked up all the political energy - it was the day the country officially left the EU. The prime minister and his team were exhausted but elated. It felt like Boris Johnson had ""just really started to take flight"", one member of the team tells me. Ministers and officials had already been meeting to discuss the virus in China - but it felt thousands of miles away. There was a ""lack of concern and energy,"" one source tells me. ""The general view was it is just hysteria. It was just like a flu."" The prime minister was even heard to say: ""The best thing would be to ignore it."" And he repeatedly warned, several sources tell me, that an overreaction could do more harm than good. A small group in Downing Street had started daily meetings, after, according to one of those who attended, ""it became clear that there was no proper, 'Emergency break-the-glass' plan."" But for many of those I've spoken to, the game-changer was at the end of February, when the virus took hold in northern Italy - it was closer to home, and England's chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, had, one minister told me, warned that if it got out of China, it would become global, and be on its way to the UK. ""The biggest moment for me was when I saw those pictures of northern Italy,"" one senior minister says. ""I thought that will be us if we don't move."" Reports of the chaos there catapulted the virus, one senior minister says, ""from not on the radar, to people on the floor of hospitals in Lombardy."" They say that was the moment ""we knew that it was inevitable"". Ministers and officials became locked in arguments over how to respond. The prime minister and many cabinet ministers were reluctant to consider anything as draconian as a lockdown. To many people, the very idea would have seemed fanciful. Even stopping shaking hands seemed a step too far for the prime minister. Before the first major coronavirus briefing on 3 March, he had, I am told, been prepared by aides to say, if asked by journalists, people should stop shaking hands with each other - as per government scientific advice. But he said the exact opposite. ""I've shaken hands with everybody,"" he said, about visiting a hospital with Covid patients. And it was not just a slip, one of those present at the briefing says. It demonstrated ""the whole conflict for him - and his lack of understanding of the severity of what was coming"". A Downing Street spokesperson told the BBC: ""The prime minister was very clear at the time he was taking a number of precautionary steps, including frequently washing his hands. Once the social distancing advice changed, the prime minister's approach changed."" By this point, Mr Johnson was attending emergency committee Cobra meetings with officials and leaders from Holyrood, Belfast and Cardiff - although he had missed the first few. But one senior politician who attended at the same time says: ""The early meetings with the prime minister were dreadful."" And inside Downing Street, senior staff's concerns about the government's ability to cope grew. There were huge logistical considerations about equipment, facilities and how fast the disease might move in the UK, and questions about how effective the actions taken in China to suppress the virus would be here. It was not well understood, for example, that people without symptoms could still pass it on, nor that Britons returning from half-term holidays in northern Europe were bringing the virus back home in large numbers. ""There was a genuine argument in government, which everyone has subsequently denied,"" one senior figure tells me, about whether there should be a hard lockdown or a plan to protect only the most vulnerable, and even encourage what was described to me at that time as ""some degree of herd immunity"". There was even talk of ""chicken pox parties"", where healthy people might be encouraged to gather to spread the disease. And while that was not considered a policy proposal, real consideration was given to whether suppressing Covid entirely could be counter productive. On 3 March, when the prime minister set out the government's plan, the focus was on detecting early cases and preventing the spread. But on 12 March, with journalists crammed into the state dining room at No 10, he told the public that the country was facing its worst health crisis in a generation. Anyone with symptoms was told to stay at home for a week. Advisers seemed confident it was not yet time to close schools or stop large crowds gathering. And the government's scientists felt they had time to slow everything down - the peak was not expected for another 10-14 weeks. That same week, though, nervousness was rising among others in government that the virus was outpacing everyone's expectations, and the plans in place to smooth out the outbreak would not work. One source tells me it felt like the ""government machine was breaking in our hands"", things were ""imploding"", and within 48 hours the approach outlined on the 12th would feel out of date. There has been no shortage of controversy over whether the government was too slow to close the doors on 23 March - but many of the conversations I have had, pinpoint the moment it became urgent in No 10. On 13 March, the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) committee concluded the virus was spreading faster than thought. But it was Downing Street ""modellers in the building"", according to one current official, who pored again over the numbers, and realised the timetable that had only just been announced was likely to result in disaster. The next morning, a small group of key staff got together. Simple graphs were drawn on a whiteboard and the prime minister was confronted with the stark prediction that the plan he had just announced would result in the NHS collapsing under the sheer number of cases. Several of those present tell me that was the moment Mr Johnson realised the urgency - that the official assumptions about the speed of the spread of this new disease had been wrong. To prevent the NHS ""falling over"", he was warned, the government would have to impose measures as infections rose. And while they could be relaxed as cases fell, this pattern might recur across ""multiple waves for 18 months"". Several sources recall vividly the ""snake like graph"" they were shown that day. Then, one official says, everything started to move at ""lightning speed"". And behind closed doors - before the terrifying projections of Imperial College became public, a couple of days later - plans were accelerated. On 16 March, the public were told to stop all unnecessary social contact and to work at home if possible. New cabinet committees were formed. And the machine moved into a different phase, with the prime minister and the ""quad"" - Matt Hancock, Michael Gove, Dominic Raab and Rishi Sunak - the new decision-making form. It was, I am told, ""high tension - [with] a lot of testosterone in the room"". For many inside government, the pace of change that week was staggering - but others remain frustrated the government machine, in their view, had failed to move quickly enough. There was tension between those who wanted to ensure systems were as ready as they could be first, and others who argued vociferously that moving fast against the virus was more important than anything else. But those I spoke to now agree on one thing - how much they did not know about the disease. ""You can kick yourself about the things that you wish you knew,"" one minister says, ""but we just didn't have anything in place."" Another cabinet minister says: ""It's easy to say we should have locked down longer, gone harder, but there are more complex debates about where the national interests really lie."" And it was all so strange. One minister who made some of the public announcements when lockdown came says: ""I remember when I wrote it into the script, I just couldn't believe that I was saying this."" And one official, struck by how huge it all felt, says he googled: ""Did they shut the schools during the War?"" Another, meanwhile, admits, ""We were more blind than we told the public,"" and suggests that is still the case one year on. On 18 March, we reported that a small number of members of staff in No 10 had fallen ill. One insider says: ""People were dropping like flies."" The prime minister, however, was acting as though he was impervious to the risk. He had developed a habit of banging his own chest, telling staff he was ""strong as a bull"". Soon, though, this chest-banging turned into ""extreme coughing fits"". Tests, in short supply everywhere, were requested for him from 25 March. And two days later, he tested positive. He switched to the chancellor's bigger suite of offices so that he could keep working, screened off from the rest of the building. Insiders recall how much he hated this and, in a second spell of isolation in the autumn, chairs had to be placed across the door ""like a puppy gate"", so he could still communicate with the tiny number of staff allowed into the same part of the building. Then, at the end of March, the prime minister became increasingly ill - each video call he made to reassure the public required more takes. On 6 April, he agreed to go to St Thomas' Hospital and, struggling for breath on a phone call, I have been told, confirmed he wanted Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab to stand in for him. Initially, Downing Street tried to give the impression that all was well. Journalists were even told that Mr Johnson was working on his red boxes. That message has been put down to a mix up, and we now know this was far from the truth. The moment of genuine crisis came when he was moved into intensive care. No-one knew if the prime minister would make it through the night - or what the plan was if he did not. By this point, with so many in No 10 and in government already sick, there were, I have been told, about ""half a dozen people running things"". Fears that he might need to be intubated were shared by a tiny group inside Number 10. They discussed the possibility that ministers would have to gather in the cabinet room, with the doors closed, until they chose a successor - but there was no fixed protocol, and no conclusion was reached. The Tory Party, I have been told, even started to consider how to transfer the leadership without a contest, fearing that such a competition could be seen as ""venal"" after the prime minister's death. Then cabinet ministers were summoned urgently for a conference call. ""All of a sudden we were asked to join this call - not knowing if he was alive,"" one tells me.  Then No 10 prepared to make the news public. The Downing Street voice on the other end of the phone cracked with fear as I was asked to get to the Foreign Office as soon possible with a camera to talk to Mr Raab, who was being sent out to try to reassure the country. We reported the news that Mr Johnson was in intensive care from the back of a taxi. A former official tells me: ""We thought we really could lose him - we had to plan for a full transition."" That night was ""long and shocking"", one source says. By the end of May, the number of coronavirus cases was falling, the prime minister was back at work full time, and the public had surprised the government by overwhelmingly sticking to the rules. Furthermore, despite some embarrassing and prominent lockdown breaches - in April, for example, Scotland's chief medical officer, Catherine Calderwood, had to quit over her visits to her holiday home - there had been what one senior minister describes as ""tremendous goodwill"". But then came the Mirror and the Guardian's scoop - in March, the prime minister's chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, had travelled hundreds of miles to County Durham, after his wife fell ill with Covid. He, too, succumbed to the virus and his stay on his family's farm to recover, before returning to London, had been kept secret - apart from among a tiny number of Downing Street staff. And Mr Cummings was determined not to quit. After considering sacking him, the prime minister stuck by him - but first, there was what has been described to me as tense ""mediation between a couple deciding whether to divorce"". Before making that decision, he had summoned Mr Cummings to go through his version of events. Together, they planned for him to give this version publicly - despite others' protestations. The result was the surreal press conference in the Downing Street rose garden. Many of those I have talked to describe this episode as a terrible turning-point. ""Even for us, this is mad,"" a member of the Downing Street team tells me. Senior ministers say: ""The handling was a fiasco"". ""It was ridiculous"", and, at a time of national emergency, ""broke the political consensus"". Perhaps, after two months of lockdown, the public was ready to be angry with someone. MPs' inboxes were swamped with irate emails - mine too. ""The early pandemic washed away all the bitterness of Brexit,"" one senior minister tells me. ""That all came flooding back, all that bile, all that pent up frustration."" Some ministers tweeted their support for Mr Cummings. One of those who refused says: ""He should have resigned straight away. You lead by example. I was busy chopping logs with my chainsaw to get the frustration out."" Some polling suggests the Barnard Castle episode really did dent the public's trust in the government. ""It gave people who wanted to break the rules an excuse,"" one source says. But inside government, there was a belief that an extraordinary period of unity had already started to fade, and the public had started to tire of the rules once the government had moved towards its plans to lift them. There is no question, though, the whole misadventure made the politics of the pandemic more scratchy and less consensual. Mr Cummings was not the only one to be caught up. In June, Northern Ireland's Deputy First Minister, Michelle O'Neill, provoked anger by attending a huge Republican funeral. But it was after Barnard Castle that it felt like the mood in the country had changed. ""People wanted to portray the PM as a clown,"" one minister tells me, ""or not up to the level of events."" Britain in the summer did not feel like a country still gripped by a pandemic. ""There was loads of over optimistic messaging,"" one politician says. For example, the time when a Labour MP asked for advice at the end of June for his constituency, which was home to a popular beach and he was worried about huge numbers heading for the sea. ""Show some guts,"" the prime minister told him. In July, a grinning chancellor delivered plates of Japanese curry to unsuspecting customers at a London restaurant, to promote his ""eat out to help out"" scheme. Then the prime minister started to encourage people back to the office. But behind closed doors, there were significant doubts about the wisdom of this new mood. ""We knew there was going to be a second wave,"" one cabinet minister tells me, ""and there was a row about whether people should work from home or not - it was totally ridiculous."" The summer optimism and opening was ""the biggest mistake - a rush of blood to the head"", another senior figure says. ""The PM has to carry the can"". The prime minister believed that another lockdown would be a disaster and wanted to avoid it at all costs - but for many of those involved in making the decisions, his hostility to tightening the rules again was frustrating, dangerous and political. ""The policy objective in the summer and the autumn was - do the minimum possible,"" one tells me. But by the end of August, with Britons packing beaches, the warnings of what might come were already flickering in Number 10. Some days, sources suggest, the prime minister would express concern about the virus coming back. Others, he would be in ""let-it-rip mode"". And senior officials expressed deep concern about what seemed to be changes of heart on a daily basis. The disease would not be contained by indecision, and  by the start of September, with schools and universities having returned, ""you could clearly see a steady increase,"" a senior figure says. The testing system had not been able to keep pace with demand, and too few people were willing to, or could afford, to self-isolate if they tested positive. ""The idea that you could liberalise in the summer was based on the idea that you could whackamole with test and trace,"" the source says. ""But if you didn't whack the right moles then it doesn't work."" By the middle of September, ""the data was already screaming out"", one insider says. On the 17th, I was told by one source: ""If you do nothing now, by the end of October you will get something worse than the first wave."" The possibility of a short ""circuit breaker"" lockdown was already being discussed in Downing Street that week. Prof Whitty, the UK's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance, and Mr Cummings and others were arguing hard for action to be taken - but the prime minister was unpersuaded. Others wanted to push again - one current official recalls a ""concerted effort"" - and on Sunday 20th, the No 10 team gathered a range of scientists. But the prime minister remained reluctant. Another current official describes his attitude as, ""if there is a way not to act, why do it?"". Over the next 36 hours, I have been told, a small group inside Downing Street repeatedly tried to change Mr Johnson's mind - but by then, he was operating in a very different atmosphere. ""A swampiness had risen because of ideological pressure on this government at every turn to do less - and to do it more slowly,"" a senior figure says. And it is understood Mr Johnson had privately assured groups of MPs there would be no more restrictions. The Treasury was pointing out the damage any further restrictions would do to the economy, many of the traditional Tory-backing newspapers were hungry for restrictions to be relaxed, the party was restless, and I remember cabinet ministers who had hardly any cases of the virus in their constituencies at that point, suggesting they saw no evidence for further action. So when Mr Johnson made changes to the coronavirus restrictions on 22 September, they were tweaks, rather than a real tightening up.  I remember talking to Tory backbenchers that day who felt they had won. The importance of the missed September moment is cited by many senior figures - and some now concede it was a mistake. ""We strained at the leash to get things going,"" one cabinet minister admits. ""I was aggressively for that - but I have learned that it is better to go slow."" Another senior minister, one of those who pushed for more radical action at the time, now says: ""We should have locked down more severely, earlier in the autumn - the whole point was, the earlier you act the more you buy yourself time for a strategy that can get out."" You can still hear the frustration in the voices of those who lost the argument. ""The PM was saying the Tory Party won't swallow it,"" one tells me. ""Everyone else felt, we know we are going to have to do a lockdown."" And there is no question that the tier system that was introduced over the autumn, which portioned England into different levels of restrictions, was soon tied up in confusion and regional spats. ""It was completely unintelligible to any normal human being,"" one senior official says. ""It was too slow, and too Byzantine, and that resulted in more cases."" Another says now: ""We ended up tying ourselves into ever tighter knots,"" as the system became more and more particular to each part of the country. It is impossible to know what would have happened if the brakes had been slammed on in September - but some ministers pin the terrible scale of the second wave, at least in part, on the apparent reluctance to act. The circuit-breaker that was imposed later in Wales did not make the problem go away, however. Case numbers weren't the only concern - the economy had been shuttered, and shattered. Political demands had changed. In defence of Mr Johnson, one senior minister says: ""He's not to blame if he was trying to reflect the aspiration for the country back in the summer"". Another tells me the plans, and the billions spent on ""test-and-trace and tiering meant it was reasonable to do the unlock"". They reject the idea that a circuit breaker was the obvious option - ""There wasn't a slam dunk recommendation."" Regarding the potential introduction of national restrictions in September, Downing Street referred us back to comments made by the prime minister to parliament in early November. ""No-one wants to impose measures unless absolutely essential,"" Mr Johnson told the Commons. ""So it made sense to focus initially on the areas where the disease was surging and not to shut businesses, pubs and restaurants in parts of the country where incidence was low."" But while there is no question mistakes were made in the first phase of the pandemic, when so much about the virus was a mystery, those involved in the decisions are already less forgiving of their own mistakes the second time around. ""A miracle,"" is how one minister describes the vaccine gamble to me. A government so often lambasted by critics for busting convention did it again - but this time, so far, with a stunning outcome. Vaccines had been discussed in January, as the government machine began to contemplate, slowly, what might be ahead. Early on the chancellor, holding the cheque book, indicated a willingness to spend at speed, without asking for guarantees. No 10 decided to ""chuck everything at it"", at a meeting in April. With Sir Patrick's crucial experience and deputy chief medical officer for England Prof Jonathan Van-Tam's emphasis on the practicalities of delivering the vaccine, politicians were persuaded to take what was then a huge risk. There was an early decision to ""pay high, pay early, and ensure it works,"" one senior official tells me. And it seems their decision was informed by everything that had gone wrong with trying to secure PPE - the collapse of the NHS's normal procurement process, which is controlled by the Department of Health. The UK decided early not to participate in the EU's joint plan to buy vaccines. While publicly this decision may have been politically controversial, behind closed doors it was ""easy"" and ""straightforward"", ministers and officials say. ""No-one wanted any of the Brexit baggage anywhere near it."" And, more importantly, the EU had made it clear any participating country would be unable to make its own deals with manufacturers the EU had an agreement with - or control its own supply. The vaccines team had warned ministers at the start of May that nothing was certain - and developing a vaccine as quickly as the prime minister, who ""wanted it yesterday"", required would be an uphill struggle. But, as one minister says, it was ""the one thing we would wish that we had done in a year's time"". Another, a senior minister, says: ""The PM strategically saw immediately that the combination of testing, drugs and vaccine was the way out."" And when it came to vaccines, the UK was ready to take an expensive gamble. The Treasury was spending speculatively in ways it had not since the War - and vaccine spending has already reached nearly Â£13.5bn. ""Imagine if it hadn't come off and we had spent all of that taxpayers' money,"" one senior official says to me. There was intense secrecy, throughout, with the various vaccines given secret code names to ensure commercial confidentiality. All were named after submarines - the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine ""Ambush"", I can now reveal, and the Oxford-AstraZeneca ""Triumph"". After 12 months of grappling with endless calculations about balancing risks to life, wider health and how the country makes a living, decision-makers are exhausted. They have to accept it is perfectly possible to be wrong, one senior minister tells me. And those who made the decisions are all too aware mistakes they made in these past 12 months may have had such a terrible cost. Â© 2025 BBC.

We'll be back tomorrow to bring you more coronavirus updates from the UK and around the world. Today's live page was brought to you by: Francesca Gillett, Jen Meierhans, Alex Therrien, Joshua Nevett, George Bowden, Sam Tonkin, Chris Clayton and Claire Heald. It's been another busy day. Here's a recap: Health care assistant Chellen Chellamboye lights a candle outside the Old House at Home pub in Dormansland, Surrey Further along the street, residents came out with their candles and dogs Trafalgar Square was among the landmarks lit up on Tuesday evening St Mary's Lighthouse in Northumberland was also illuminated Prime Minister Boris Johnson has told the 1922 Committee of backbench Conservative MPs that the UK had got a successful vaccine quickly because of ""capitalism"" and ""greed"".

Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and former health secretary Jeremy Hunt are among the public figures who have shared pictures of burning candles tonight. It's part of the ""beacon of remembrance"" event which has encouraged people to light candles at their windows and doorsteps to commemorate those who have died from the virus. Ms Sturgeon shared a photo on Twitter, as did Mr Hunt who addressed the families of the 126,284 people who have died, saying: ""Our thoughts and prayers are with you tonight.""

As landmarks and buildings were illuminated, so too were doorsteps as thousands lit candles to remember those lost during the pandemic. Neighbours spoke to each other over a glass of wine in Fulham, west London People had been encouraged to light up their doorsteps on Tuesday evening Holly Wilson, whose grandmother Ada Wilson passed away during the pandemic, lit a candle at Belfast Cathedral There was a sombre reflection for those lost during the pandemic in Dormansland, Surrey A woman lit a candle outside an illuminated Lichfield Cathedral in Staffordshire At No 10 Downing Street, a staff member was seen placing a candle on the doorstep for the 20:00 vigil. As millions remember those who have died as a result of the pandemic in the UK with candles, torches and phones on the doorsteps, buildings across the country have also been lit up in remembrance. Sunderland's Northern Spire Bridge looked striking as it was lit up at nightfall The iconic Kelpies sculpture in Falkirk is also lit up In the capital, the London Eye was among the landmarks illuminated Meanwhile, the outside of Lichfield Cathedral bore the words ""Reflect, Support, Hope"". Inside the cathedral, candles were lit In Cardiff, the castle in the city centre was lit up And the clock tower at Cardiff's Roath Park lake was also lit up in yellow The focus of today has been looking back on the past year and remembering those who have died with coronavirus. Earlier, Boris Johnson said there will come a moment where the UK can create a permanent memorial to the dead. But this evening, buildings are being lit up and people will stand on their doorsteps and light up their windows with candles and torchlight. If you want to read about some of the people we are remembering ahead of tonight's vigil, thenwe've got a tribute page here. To see tributes to all of the people who have died would take more than 312 hours. So we have gathered words of remembrance from friends, family and colleagues to remember more than 750 of those who have died. Candles have already been lit at places of worship across the country, including Lichfield Cathedral Remembrance events are set to continue in cities across the UK tonight to mark the anniversary of lockdown and commemorate all those who have died with the virus. This evening people are being encouraged to stand on their doorsteps with candles, torches or light shone from their phones. It's due to happen at 20:00 - the same time that people used to stand at their doorsteps for the clap for carers - and it's been called a ""beacon of remembrance"". Buildings across the UK are also going to be illuminated at nightfall. London's skyline will turn yellow with landmarks including the London Eye, Trafalgar Square and Wembley Stadium lighting up. Cardiff Castle and Belfast City Hall will also be lit up, while churches and cathedrals will toll bells, light thousands of candles and offer prayers. Intensive care units in Brazil are struggling to cope with a new influx of patients Coronavirus continues to
surge ""dangerously"" across Brazil, the World Health
Organization's regional director for the Americas has warned. Carissa
Etienne urged all Brazilians to adopt
preventative measures to stop the spread of the virus. ""Unfortunately, the dire situation in Brazil is also
affecting neighbouring countries,"" Etienne, director of the Pan
American Health Organization, said in a briefing. She
said cases have risen in Venezuela's Bolivar and Amazonas
states, and in border regions of Peru and Bolivia. Last week, Brazil's leadinghealth institute, Fiocruz, warned of an historic collapse of the country's health service. It said intensive care units in hospitals were running out of capacity. Covid ""certificates"" could be used to help people return to large gatherings such as sporting events, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden has previously said. But what are they? In the UK, anyone who has had a jab receives a vaccination card and the details go on their medical records. Now, the UK is among a number of countries considering whether to introduce other ways of confirming that people have been vaccinated. It's been suggested a passport feature could be added to the existing NHS app. People could use it to prove they have been vaccinated or recently tested negative. European officials have announced plans for a ""Green Digital Certificate,external"". This would allow anyone vaccinated against Covid, or who has tested negative, or recently recovered from the virus, to travel within the EU. Officials hope it will be in place before the summer tourist season. However, some EU members have expressed concerns the certificate could be discriminatory. And in the UK, apetition asking the government not to introduce vaccine passportswill be considered for a debate by MPs. Read more Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The vaccination programme is going well, but once again we
are being reminded of the threat of a third wave. Both the prime ministers and his senior advisers made
reference to it. With restrictions lifting, cases are likely to go up â
although there is hope the change in seasons will help limit those rises. Over half of adults are vaccinated, but that still leaves
many millions susceptible. Some will be in the vulnerable groups â either because they
have chosen not to take up the vaccine or because it has not worked. That means people will still die just as they do from flu
each year. In a bad winter, there can be more than 20,000 flu deaths. Modelling suggests with the vaccine rollout and a careful
lifting of restrictions there could be 30,000 Covid deaths by summer 2022. But the governmentâs advisers made clear there really is no
other option, saying there is âclose to zero chanceâ of zero Covid for a virus
that spreads so easily, often undetected because so many do not even develop
symptoms. The challenge now is managing that risk. BBC Radio 4 Today presenter Nick Robinson is in Newcastle upon Tyne, where the BBC is hostingLockdown Live: What Next?- a special programme that marks a year since the first UK lockdown was announced. Here's what he's got to say: Stay safe the Toon. See you soon! That message above the entrance to the Everyman cinema on Newcastle's historic Grey Street is a reminder of what we're all missing. So too are the posters outside the Theatre Royal: ""There will be a short interval."" It is, however, the closed shutters on bars and cafes and restaurants that are really stark reminders. This street in a city that takes pride in its reputation as a party town would normally be filled with people having fun long into the night. There are signs, however, of a city preparing to open again. Come 12 April, people will be able to eat out and drink outside again, providing they're willing to wrap up warm and huddle beneath an outdoor heater. Bar Luga's owner Ollie Vaulkhard, a well-known entrepreneur in the city, is preparing to welcome people back on to his outdoor terrace. A third of people are still terrified of Covid, he tells me. A third couldn't care less and a third are persuadable. That, he believes, adds up to plenty of business. This pandemic has, he says, weeded out good businesses from the bad. He compares it to the meteorite that wiped out the dinosaurs but left others to take over the planet. Read the full piece here. Reality Check Englandâs chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty was
asked about the one thing he wished he had done differently. In the early stages of the pandemic, he said that they had
much less of an understanding about how widespread the virus was in Europe - âwe
now know the amounts of importation there were from Spain, from France and from
bits of Italyâ¦but at the time we didnât have that information and that would
almost certainly have led to slightly different approaches to how we did
things.â Between January and mid-March 2020, the
focus was on quarantine measures on people arriving from Wuhan in China. But a study subsequently found that the virus was
introduced to the UK ""well over a thousand times in early 2020"", with
a third of transmission chains brought in from Spain, followed by 29% from
France, neither of which faced any restrictions at the time. China accounted for just 0.4% of imported cases. Early in the pandemic, the Sage group of scientists which
advises the government, did not think that blocking international travel was a
feasible option. At a meeting in February 2020,,externalSage suggested that
cutting the number of infections entering the UK by half would only delay the
epidemic by five days. It estimated that a 95%
reduction in imported cases, requiring ""draconian"" travel
restrictions, would have pushed things back by a month. Read more here. Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent As we inch towards summer many
people want to know whether they can realistically look to head off on
holiday abroad. Boris Johnson repeated the ministerial mantra that itâs ""too
early"" to say. However, he also said he hoped to give an update by 5 April - although itâs not clear how significant an announcement that will be. The
taskforce looking at international travel wasnât due to report until 12 April. Either way, the overall tone wasnât hugely optimistic as the prime minister
also said that things looked âdifficultâ for the time-being due to rising case
rates in parts of Europe. Read more about the new travel ruleshere. Deaths are below the usual levels for March, according to the most-recent weekly UK death registrations. The number of patients in hospital with coronavirus is continuing to fall, too. The most recent data showed there were 5,461 Covid patients in hospital, a number not seen since October. There were 112 new deaths within 28 days of a positive test reported on Tuesday, with 5,379 new cases. Another 329,897 people received a first vaccine dose. This video can not be played Earlier, in his No 10 press conference, Boris Johnson said it was ""thanks to all of you that we can continue on our roadmap to freedom"". He repeated the government's pledge to offer a vaccine dose to everyone aged over 50 by the middle of April, and to all adults by the end of July. ""And cautiously but irreversibly, step by step, jab by jab, this country is on the path to reclaiming our freedoms,"" he said. The prime minister has just finished giving a coronavirus

that spreads so easily, often undetected because so many do not even develop
symptoms. The challenge now is managing that risk. BBC Radio 4 Today presenter Nick Robinson is in Newcastle upon Tyne, where the BBC is hostingLockdown Live: What Next?- a special programme that marks a year since the first UK lockdown was announced. Here's what he's got to say: Stay safe the Toon. See you soon! That message above the entrance to the Everyman cinema on Newcastle's historic Grey Street is a reminder of what we're all missing. So too are the posters outside the Theatre Royal: ""There will be a short interval."" It is, however, the closed shutters on bars and cafes and restaurants that are really stark reminders. This street in a city that takes pride in its reputation as a party town would normally be filled with people having fun long into the night. There are signs, however, of a city preparing to open again. Come 12 April, people will be able to eat out and drink outside again, providing they're willing to wrap up warm and huddle beneath an outdoor heater. Bar Luga's owner Ollie Vaulkhard, a well-known entrepreneur in the city, is preparing to welcome people back on to his outdoor terrace. A third of people are still terrified of Covid, he tells me. A third couldn't care less and a third are persuadable. That, he believes, adds up to plenty of business. This pandemic has, he says, weeded out good businesses from the bad. He compares it to the meteorite that wiped out the dinosaurs but left others to take over the planet. Read the full piece here. Reality Check Englandâs chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty was
asked about the one thing he wished he had done differently. In the early stages of the pandemic, he said that they had
much less of an understanding about how widespread the virus was in Europe - âwe
now know the amounts of importation there were from Spain, from France and from
bits of Italyâ¦but at the time we didnât have that information and that would
almost certainly have led to slightly different approaches to how we did
things.â Between January and mid-March 2020, the
focus was on quarantine measures on people arriving from Wuhan in China. But a study subsequently found that the virus was
introduced to the UK ""well over a thousand times in early 2020"", with
a third of transmission chains brought in from Spain, followed by 29% from
France, neither of which faced any restrictions at the time. China accounted for just 0.4% of imported cases. Early in the pandemic, the Sage group of scientists which
advises the government, did not think that blocking international travel was a
feasible option. At a meeting in February 2020,,externalSage suggested that
cutting the number of infections entering the UK by half would only delay the
epidemic by five days. It estimated that a 95%
reduction in imported cases, requiring ""draconian"" travel
restrictions, would have pushed things back by a month. Read more here. Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent As we inch towards summer many
people want to know whether they can realistically look to head off on
holiday abroad. Boris Johnson repeated the ministerial mantra that itâs ""too
early"" to say. However, he also said he hoped to give an update by 5 April - although itâs not clear how significant an announcement that will be. The
taskforce looking at international travel wasnât due to report until 12 April. Either way, the overall tone wasnât hugely optimistic as the prime minister
also said that things looked âdifficultâ for the time-being due to rising case
rates in parts of Europe. Read more about the new travel ruleshere. Deaths are below the usual levels for March, according to the most-recent weekly UK death registrations. The number of patients in hospital with coronavirus is continuing to fall, too. The most recent data showed there were 5,461 Covid patients in hospital, a number not seen since October. There were 112 new deaths within 28 days of a positive test reported on Tuesday, with 5,379 new cases. Another 329,897 people received a first vaccine dose. This video can not be played Earlier, in his No 10 press conference, Boris Johnson said it was ""thanks to all of you that we can continue on our roadmap to freedom"". He repeated the government's pledge to offer a vaccine dose to everyone aged over 50 by the middle of April, and to all adults by the end of July. ""And cautiously but irreversibly, step by step, jab by jab, this country is on the path to reclaiming our freedoms,"" he said. The prime minister has just finished giving a coronavirus

"Godzilla vs Kong will fight it out in US cinemas from next month Cineworld has announced it will reopen US cinemas next month, followed by the UK in May, after signing a deal with Warner Bros to show films in theatres before they are streamed. The company will open a handful of its Regal cinemas in the US in early April. Godzilla vs. Kong will be the first film to make its debut in the theatres. Cineworld said the deal with Warner Bros means films will have a period of exclusivity in cinemas before being made more widely available. It follows a row last year when Cineworld and rival AMC, which owns the Odeon Cinemas chain, criticised Universal Pictures for releasing Trolls: World Tour online while theatres were forced to close because of the coronavirus. Both Cineworld and AMC threatened not to show some Universal Pictures films. However, AMC later reached an agreement with Universal where films would first show in theatres for a period before becoming available to rent online. Under its deal with Warner Bros., from next year Cineworld can exclusively show its films for 45 days. In the UK, the period will be 31 days though that can be extended to 45 days for movies ""that open to an agreed upon  box-office threshold"". ""This agreement shows the studio's commitment to the theatrical business and we see this agreement as an important milestone in our 100-year relationship with Warner Bros,"" said Cineworld chief executive Mooky Greidinger. Mortal Kombat will be released in April Godzilla vs. Kong, starring English actress Millie Bobby Brown, will start showing on 2 April in the US in a phased reopening of Cineworld's Regal theatres. It will be followed by Mortal Kombat, the movie based on the hugely popular computer game, on 16 April. The company said it also plans to reopen in the UK - which is its second biggest market - in May, ""in line with current government guidance"". The cinemas now hiring out their screens to gamers The cinema industry has been one of the worst hit sectors during the pandemic with many theatres closed for extended periods or operating at reduced capacity. Global box office takings in 2020 fell by more than 70% from the previous year to $12.4bn, according film technology firm Gower Street Analytics. Dune, starring Zendaya, will now be released in October this year Major releases such as the latest James Bond film, No Time to Die,have been delayed a number of timesbecause of Covid.

"The virus that causes the common cold can effectively boot the Covid virus out of the body's cells, say researchers. Some viruses are known to compete in order to be the one that causes an infection. And University of Glasgow scientists say it appears cold-causing rhinovirus trumps coronavirus. The benefits might be short-lived but rhinovirus is so widespread, they add, it could still help to suppress Covid. Covid symptoms: Is it a cold, flu or coronavirus? Coronavirus doctor's diary: Will Covid be with us forever, like flu? Think of the cells in your nose, throat and lungs as being like a row of houses. Once a virus gets inside, it can either hold the door open to let in other viruses, or it can nail the door shut and keep its new home to itself. Influenza is one of the most selfish viruses around, and nearly always infects alone. Others, such as adenoviruses,seem to be more up for a houseshare.,external There has been much speculation about how the virus that causes Covid, known as Sars-CoV-2, would fit into the mysterious world of ""virus-virus interactions"". The challenge for scientists is that a year of social distancing has slowed the spread of all viruses and made it much harder to study. The team at the Centre for Virus Research in Glasgow used a replica of the lining of our airways, made out of the same types of cells, and infected it with Sars-CoV-2 and rhinovirus, which is one of the most widespread infections in people, and a cause of the common cold. If rhinovirus and Sars-CoV-2 were released at the same time, only rhinovirus is successful. If rhinovirus had a 24-hour head start then Sars-CoV-2 does not get a look in. And even when Sars-CoV-2 had 24-hours to get started, rhinovirus boots it out. ""Sars-CoV-2 never takes off, it is heavily inhibited by rhinovirus,"" Dr Pablo Murcia told BBC News. He added: ""This is absolutely exciting because if you have a high prevalence of rhinovirus, it could stop new Sars-CoV-2 infections."" Similar effects have been seen before. A large rhinovirus outbreakmay have delayed the 2009 swine flu pandemic in parts of Europe.,external Further experiments showed rhinovirus was triggering an immune response inside the infected cells, which blocked the ability of Sars-CoV-2 to make copies of itself. When scientists blocked the immune response, then levels of the Covid virus were the same as if rhinovirus was not there. However, Covid would be able to cause an infection again once the cold had passed and the immune response calmed down. Dr Murcia said: ""Vaccination, plus hygiene measures, plus the interactions between viruses could lower the incidence of Sars-CoV-2 heavily, but the maximum effect will come from vaccination."" Prof Lawrence Young, of Warwick Medical School, said human rhinoviruses, the most frequent cause of the common cold, were ""highly transmissible"". He added that this study suggests ""that this common infection could impact the burden of Covid-19 and influence the spread of SarsCoV2, particularly over the autumn and winter months when seasonal colds are more frequent"". Exactly how all this settles down in future winters is still unknown. Coronavirus is likely to still be around, and all the other infections that have been suppressed during the pandemic could bounce back as immunity to them wanes. Dr Susan Hopkins, from Public Health England,has already warned of a ""hard winter""as a result. ""We could see surges in flu. We could see surges in other respiratory viruses and other respiratory pathogens,"" she said, The results have been published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases.

"The actor Ricky Tomlinson (centre) was one of 24 trade unionists charged with offences including unlawful assembly, conspiracy to intimidate and affray for picketing The Court of Appeal has overturned the convictions of 14 men sentenced for their involvement in pickets in 1972. Trade unionists who picketed during the national builders' strike were charged with offences including unlawful assembly and conspiracy to intimidate. Lawyers for the so-called Shrewsbury 24 had argued the destruction of witness statements made their convictions unsafe. Lord Justice Fulford said ""what occurred was unfair"". The Royle Family star Ricky Tomlinson was among those convicted. He was jailed for two years. Speaking after the verdict, he said: ""It is only right that these convictions are overturned."" Six of the 14 who brought the action have since died, including Dennis Warren, who was jailed for three years. Mr Tomlinson added: ""My thoughts today are with my friend and comrade Des Warren. ""I'm just sorry he is not here today so we can celebrate, but I'm sure he's with us in spirit."" Appellants Terry Renshaw (second left) and John McKinsie Jones (centre) outside the Court of Appeal at a previous hearing Speaking at the Royal Courts of Justice in London, Lord Justice Fulford said: ""These 14 appeals against conviction are allowed across the three trials and on every extant count which the 14 appellants faced."" But he added: ""It would not be in the public interest to order a retrial."" In its written ruling, the Court of Appeal allowed the 14 appellants' appeals on the grounds that original witness statements had been destroyed. In June 1972, trade unionists called the UK's first-ever national builders' strike in protest against pay, unjust employment practices and dangerous conditions on sites. Trade unionists travelled to demonstrate from one site to another and in September six coach-loads of strikers demonstrated in Shrewsbury and Telford. Police arrested none of the demonstrators that day but five months later the picketers were charged and subsequently convicted. Dennis Warren, deceased, and Ricky Tomlinson were among the 14 appellants in the case Lord Justice Fulford wrote: ""If the destruction of the handwritten statements had been revealed to the appellants at the time of the trial, this issue could have been comprehensively investigated with the witnesses when they gave evidence, and the judge would have been able to give appropriate directions. ""We have no doubt that if that had happened, the trial process would have ensured fairness to the accused. Self-evidently, that is not what occurred. ""By the standards of today, what occurred was unfair to the extent that the verdicts cannot be upheld."" Lawyers had argued the broadcast of a documentary about communism during the trials was ""deeply prejudicial"", but the Court of Appeal dismissed the claim that the Red under the Bed documentary might have made the verdicts unsafe. Arthur Murray, who was convicted of affray and unlawful assembly and sentenced to six months, said: ""We were innocent all along, yet it has taken us nearly 50 years to clear our names. ""Sadly my mother and four of my siblings have passed away without knowing that we were innocent. ""Serious questions need to be asked about the role of the building industry bosses in our convictions and the highest offices of government who all had a hand in our trial and conviction. ""Make no mistake, our convictions were a political witch-hunt."" The convictions triggered a massive campaign among left-wing groups during the 1970s Mr Tomlinson, from Liverpool, echoed his remarks, saying: ""We were brought to trial at the apparent behest of the building industry bosses, the Conservative government and ably supported by the secret state. ""This was a political trial not just of me, and the Shrewsbury pickets - but was a trial of the trade union movement."" Tomlinson and trade unionists in Court of Appeal Ricky Tomlinson's strike conviction to be reviewed Latest news from the West Midlands Terry Renshaw, a former Flintshire mayor, who was convicted of unlawful assembly, paid tribute to the campaign's researcher, Eileen Turnbull, who worked ""tirelessly"" to obtain ""crucial evidence"". She uncovered a document in the National Archives which were part of the prosecution papers and revealed for the first time police had destroyed some of the original witness statements. Mr Renshaw added: ""It's been 47 years. I'm just so emotional. I didn't think it would hit me like this. I am no longer a criminal.""

"This video can not be played Emergency responders led people in the area to safety A gunman has killed 10 people, including a police officer, following an hours-long stand-off at a grocery store in the US state of Colorado. The attack in Boulder ended with police detaining an injured suspect at the King Soopers market. The shooting was live-streamed by witnesses and broadcast on YouTube. Among the dead was 51-year-old Eric Talley, who was the first police officer to respond to the shooting. ""This is a tragedy and a nightmare for Boulder County,"" the area's district attorney, Michael Dougherty, said. ""These were people going about their day, doing their shopping. I promise the victims and the people of the state of Colorado that we will secure justice."" No other details have been released about the nine other victims or a motive for the attack. The grocery store is located in a busy shopping plaza in Boulder, a north-central Colorado city about 30 miles (50km) away from the state capital of Denver. The supermarket attack comes less than a week aftera mass shooting that left eight dead, including six Asian women, at three spas in Atlanta. Atlanta shootings: How we talk about violence The silent epidemic of Americaâs problem with guns How the pandemic led to the highest-ever spike in US gun sales The incident began at about 14:30 local time (20:30 GMT) on Monday when the suspect entered the supermarket and began firing. Shoppers and employees of the store said they had to dive for cover or run to safety as the shooting unfolded. Some of the stand-off was captured on camera by a passer-by, showing victims near the grocery store. Customers and employees fled the store when the shooting began Dozens of FBI and SWAT officers were deployed to the scene ""I don't know what's going on... I heard gunshots, someone's down,"" the cameraman shouts. ""There's an active shooter, get away"". Gunshots can be heard as he runs away from the shop. The video continues, with police arriving on the scene and surrounding the market. The Boulder police department later warned people to avoid the area and told them not to ""broadcast on social media any tactical information you might see"". ""We were at the checkout, and shots just started going off,"" said Sarah Moonshadow, a customer caught up in the shooting with her son Nicholas. Sarah Moonshadow, who was inside the store when shooting began, being comforted by two others outside the store She told Reuters she had tried to help one of the victims lying on the pavement outside the store, but her son pulled her away saying ""we have to go"". ""I couldn't help anybody,"" she said. Ryan Borowski, who was also inside the store, told CNN he could not believe what had happened in his town: ""This feels like the safest spot in America, and I just nearly got killed for getting a soda and a bag of chips."" Eyewitnesses said the suspect was armed with a rifle. A police source told CNN it was an AR-15 style rifle, a semi-automatic gun that has been used in several mass shootings across the US. Aerial footage later showed a handcuffed, shirtless man with an apparent injury to his leg being put onto a stretcher for treatment. Authorities did not say whether he was the suspect or not. Speaking at a press conference, Boulder police chief Maris Herold confirmed that a suspect was in custody and was receiving hospital treatment. ""I want to reassure the community that they are safe,"" she said. Ms Herold named the officer killed as Eric Talley, a father of seven who had been with the Boulder Police Department since 2010.

""The heroic action of this officer when he responded to the scene... phone calls of shots fired in the area and a phone call about a possible person with a patrol rifle,"" she said. Ms Herold did not provide further details about the shooting, but said that the investigation was ""very complex"" and would take ""no less than five days to complete"". The names of the other victims will not be released until relatives have been informed. ""Today we saw the face of evil. I am grieving with my community and all Coloradans,"" tweeted Colorado Governor Jared Polis. The supermarket shooting was the seventh mass killing so far this year following a lull in mass killings during the pandemic last year, according to a database compiled by the Associated Press (AP), USA Today and Northeastern University. The database defines mass killings as four or more dead. It has already led to renewed calls for tighter gun controls in the US, a starkly divisive issue that has seen little in the way of change over the years despite hundreds of mass shootings. Former Arizona congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, a gun control advocate who was seriously injured in a mass shooting in 2011, said: ""It's been 10 years and countless communities have faced something similar... this is not normal.""

Responding to the news, US Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said on Twitter: ""This Senate must and will move forward on legislation to help stop the epidemic of gun violence."" President Joe Biden, who has been briefed about the latest attack, said last month he would be recommending tougher legislation to ensure background checks on anyone wishing to purchase a firearm. Freshman Republican Congresswoman Lauren Boebert, a staunch defender of gun rights, tweeted that she was ""praying for the police, first responders, and those affected by this tragedy"". The right to bear arms is protected by the Second Amendment to the US constitution and is staunchly defended by many conservatives, including ex-president Donald Trump. The state of Colorado has seen a number of mass shootings over the last few decades, including the 1999 Columbine High School attack that left 12 students and a teacher dead and the 2012 attack at a cinema in Aurora that killed 12 people.

"Working from home, walking and shopping locally are among the lockdown behaviours that look likely to remain popular after pandemic restrictions are lifted, according to a new survey. The study for BBC News and King's College London, conducted by Ipsos MORI, suggests virus regulations may have a lasting impact after Covid. Some 40% of 2,200 people surveyed said they expected to walk more than before. And staying at home appears to have connected people to their neighbours. The survey also suggests the country is divided on whether the country is divided - 38% think the pandemic has deepened divisions, while 35% think it's brought people closer together. Almost a third of workers (32%) say they anticipate working from home more and doing more of their shopping locally (31%). A quarter of commuters (23%) say they will do less travelling to work than they used to, rising to almost a third (31%) in London. It remains to be seen how significant the move from office working will be, but the implications are potentially huge. In the English capital, for example, a reduction of a third in the numbers making the daily trek into central London would be a major hit to the hospitality and other service sectors that rely on commuters. How Covid has changed where we want to live 12 charts showing how Covid changed our lives Basic tasks in lockdown - what has changed? A number of big employers have suggested they expect to see a permanent reduction in the number ofpeople working from officesor the number of days spent commuting. A shift in spending towards local neighbourhoods could bring economic advantages to smaller towns and High Streets, many of which have been badly affected by the move to online shopping. The last year has not been uniformly bad for people. The survey suggests a quarter of the population (24%) had a ""much worse"" year than average, and two-thirds of people overall (65%) said it was ""worse"" than usual. But one in 10 say the last year has actually been better than average. Surprisingly, perhaps, 18% of young people (16-24) say the last 12 months have been better than average. The pandemic also appears to have changed political priorities. Seven in 10 say health workers should get more financial support from government. Around six in ten think the low-paid (62%) and social care staff (58%) deserve more help, and around half want homeless people (53%) and small businesses (50%) to get more state assistance. However, 44% say people in other countries who receive financial aid from the UK should get less money after the pandemic. It may be a year since the start of the first nationwide lockdown, but it remains far from clear how this pandemic will change us and what the ""new normal"" might look like. The crisis is not yet over and the safety nets put in place by the government largely remain. How we respond to the profound economic, political and social challenges that lie ahead will be the real test of how Covid has changed Britain. Follow Markon Twitter,external.

"Waitrose said the change was inspired by a campaign by 10-year-old Skye from Gwynedd. Waitrose has said it will no longer sell children's magazines with plastic disposable toys to help tackle pollution. The retailer said the free plastic toys have a short lifespan and cannot easily be recycled. This comes amid calls from some of the children they are aimed at to stop giving away free plastic toys. Over the next eight weeks, it will be removing magazines containing the free toys from its shelves. Waitrose is urging publishers to replace ""pointless plastic"" with sustainable alternatives. It said the move was inspired by Skye, a 10-year-old from Gwynedd, who launched a campaign to persuade publishers to stop giving away the disposable toys in magazines. Plastic pollution: Fairbourne child's bid to ban toys in magazines Sisters petition McDonald's and Burger King for plastic toy ban ""I'm really pleased so many people have agreed with me and supported my petition - I want to thank everyone who has signed and shared my campaign to ban plastics from comics and magazines,"" Skye told the BBC. ""Thank you to Waitrose for agreeing with us and no longer selling the unwanted plastic tat. ""I hope all retailers can do the same and then the publishers will realise this is not acceptable anymore. We really like the magazines - we just don't want or need the plastic packaging or the cheap plastic toys."" The ban will not include educational or reusable craft items which are designed to be used multiple times, such as colouring pens and pencils, and collectable models. Marija Rompani, partner and director of sustainability and ethics at Waitrose, said: ""While we know these magazines are popular with children, some of the unnecessary plastic attached to them has become really excessive. This video can not be played In 2019, Ella (left) and Caitlin McEwan said they were ""amazed"" by Burger King's decision to stop including plastic toys in their children's meals ""Many in the younger generation really care about the planet and are the ones inheriting the problem of plastic pollution. ""We urge publishers to find alternatives, and other retailers to follow our lead in ending the pointless plastic that comes with children's magazines."" The retailer has written to magazine distributors giving them eight weeks' notice of the policy, asking for alternatives to plastic toys and warning that they will not sell copies which contain the disposable items. It is the latest move by the supermarket to cut down on single-use plastic, which has also seen it end the sale of Christmas crackers with plastic toys or glitter, and has a push to make all its own-label packaging recycled, reusable or home compostable. Children's plastics campaign's have been successful in the past. In 2019, Burger Kingstopped including plastic toys in their children's mealsand McDonald's gave children options of books with Happy Meals, after a campaign by two sisters.

"This video can not be played Emergency responders led people in the area to safety A gunman has killed 10 people, including a police officer, following an hours-long stand-off at a grocery store in the US state of Colorado. The attack in Boulder ended with police detaining an injured suspect at the King Soopers market. The shooting was live-streamed by witnesses and broadcast on YouTube. Among the dead was 51-year-old Eric Talley, who was the first police officer to respond to the shooting. ""This is a tragedy and a nightmare for Boulder County,"" the area's district attorney, Michael Dougherty, said. ""These were people going about their day, doing their shopping. I promise the victims and the people of the state of Colorado that we will secure justice."" No other details have been released about the nine other victims or a motive for the attack. The grocery store is located in a busy shopping plaza in Boulder, a north-central Colorado city about 30 miles (50km) away from the state capital of Denver. The supermarket attack comes less than a week aftera mass shooting that left eight dead, including six Asian women, at three spas in Atlanta. Atlanta shootings: How we talk about violence The silent epidemic of Americaâs problem with guns How the pandemic led to the highest-ever spike in US gun sales The incident began at about 14:30 local time (20:30 GMT) on Monday when the suspect entered the supermarket and began firing. Shoppers and employees of the store said they had to dive for cover or run to safety as the shooting unfolded. Some of the stand-off was captured on camera by a passer-by, showing victims near the grocery store. Customers and employees fled the store when the shooting began Dozens of FBI and SWAT officers were deployed to the scene ""I don't know what's going on... I heard gunshots, someone's down,"" the cameraman shouts. ""There's an active shooter, get away"". Gunshots can be heard as he runs away from the shop. The video continues, with police arriving on the scene and surrounding the market. The Boulder police department later warned people to avoid the area and told them not to ""broadcast on social media any tactical information you might see"". ""We were at the checkout, and shots just started going off,"" said Sarah Moonshadow, a customer caught up in the shooting with her son Nicholas. Sarah Moonshadow, who was inside the store when shooting began, being comforted by two others outside the store She told Reuters she had tried to help one of the victims lying on the pavement outside the store, but her son pulled her away saying ""we have to go"". ""I couldn't help anybody,"" she said. Ryan Borowski, who was also inside the store, told CNN he could not believe what had happened in his town: ""This feels like the safest spot in America, and I just nearly got killed for getting a soda and a bag of chips."" Eyewitnesses said the suspect was armed with a rifle. A police source told CNN it was an AR-15 style rifle, a semi-automatic gun that has been used in several mass shootings across the US. Aerial footage later showed a handcuffed, shirtless man with an apparent injury to his leg being put onto a stretcher for treatment. Authorities did not say whether he was the suspect or not. Speaking at a press conference, Boulder police chief Maris Herold confirmed that a suspect was in custody and was receiving hospital treatment. ""I want to reassure the community that they are safe,"" she said. Ms Herold named the officer killed as Eric Talley, a father of seven who had been with the Boulder Police Department since 2010.

"Waitrose said the change was inspired by a campaign by 10-year-old Skye from Gwynedd. Waitrose has said it will no longer sell children's magazines with plastic disposable toys to help tackle pollution. The retailer said the free plastic toys have a short lifespan and cannot easily be recycled. This comes amid calls from some of the children they are aimed at to stop giving away free plastic toys. Over the next eight weeks, it will be removing magazines containing the free toys from its shelves. Waitrose is urging publishers to replace ""pointless plastic"" with sustainable alternatives. It said the move was inspired by Skye, a 10-year-old from Gwynedd, who launched a campaign to persuade publishers to stop giving away the disposable toys in magazines. Plastic pollution: Fairbourne child's bid to ban toys in magazines Sisters petition McDonald's and Burger King for plastic toy ban ""I'm really pleased so many people have agreed with me and supported my petition - I want to thank everyone who has signed and shared my campaign to ban plastics from comics and magazines,"" Skye told the BBC. ""Thank you to Waitrose for agreeing with us and no longer selling the unwanted plastic tat. ""I hope all retailers can do the same and then the publishers will realise this is not acceptable anymore. We really like the magazines - we just don't want or need the plastic packaging or the cheap plastic toys.""

"The virus that causes the common cold can effectively boot the Covid virus out of the body's cells, say researchers. Some viruses are known to compete in order to be the one that causes an infection. And University of Glasgow scientists say it appears cold-causing rhinovirus trumps coronavirus. The benefits might be short-lived but rhinovirus is so widespread, they add, it could still help to suppress Covid. Covid symptoms: Is it a cold, flu or coronavirus? Coronavirus doctor's diary: Will Covid be with us forever, like flu? Think of the cells in your nose, throat and lungs as being like a row of houses. Once a virus gets inside, it can either hold the door open to let in other viruses, or it can nail the door shut and keep its new home to itself. Influenza is one of the most selfish viruses around, and nearly always infects alone. Others, such as adenoviruses,seem to be more up for a houseshare.,external There has been much speculation about how the virus that causes Covid, known as Sars-CoV-2, would fit into the mysterious world of ""virus-virus interactions"". The challenge for scientists is that a year of social distancing has slowed the spread of all viruses and made it much harder to study. The team at the Centre for Virus Research in Glasgow used a replica of the lining of our airways, made out of the same types of cells, and infected it with Sars-CoV-2 and rhinovirus, which is one of the most widespread infections in people, and a cause of the common cold. If rhinovirus and Sars-CoV-2 were released at the same time, only rhinovirus is successful. If rhinovirus had a 24-hour head start then Sars-CoV-2 does not get a look in. And even when Sars-CoV-2 had 24-hours to get started, rhinovirus boots it out. ""Sars-CoV-2 never takes off, it is heavily inhibited by rhinovirus,"" Dr Pablo Murcia told BBC News. He added: ""This is absolutely exciting because if you have a high prevalence of rhinovirus, it could stop new Sars-CoV-2 infections."" Similar effects have been seen before. A large rhinovirus outbreakmay have delayed the 2009 swine flu pandemic in parts of Europe.,external Further experiments showed rhinovirus was triggering an immune response inside the infected cells, which blocked the ability of Sars-CoV-2 to make copies of itself. When scientists blocked the immune response, then levels of the Covid virus were the same as if rhinovirus was not there. However, Covid would be able to cause an infection again once the cold had passed and the immune response calmed down. Dr Murcia said: ""Vaccination, plus hygiene measures, plus the interactions between viruses could lower the incidence of Sars-CoV-2 heavily, but the maximum effect will come from vaccination."" Prof Lawrence Young, of Warwick Medical School, said human rhinoviruses, the most frequent cause of the common cold, were ""highly transmissible"". He added that this study suggests ""that this common infection could impact the burden of Covid-19 and influence the spread of SarsCoV2, particularly over the autumn and winter months when seasonal colds are more frequent"". Exactly how all this settles down in future winters is still unknown. Coronavirus is likely to still be around, and all the other infections that have been suppressed during the pandemic could bounce back as immunity to them wanes. Dr Susan Hopkins, from Public Health England,has already warned of a ""hard winter""as a result. ""We could see surges in flu. We could see surges in other respiratory viruses and other respiratory pathogens,"" she said, The results have been published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases.

"Covid-19 vaccines, vaccine passports and faked negative test papers are being sold on the darknet. Prices range between $500 (Â£360) and $750 for doses of AstraZeneca, Sputnik, Sinopharm or Johnson & Johnson jabs. Fake vaccination certificates are also being sold by anonymous traders for as little as $150. Researchers say they have seen a ""sharp increase"" in vaccine-related darknet adverts, while the BBC has been unable to verify if the vaccines are real. The darknet, also known as the dark web, is a portion of the internet that is only accessible through specific browser tools. An advert on one marketplace claiming to sell Covid-19 vaccines Researchers at cyber-security company Check Point have monitored hacking forums and other marketplaces since January, when vaccine adverts first appeared. They say the number of adverts they have seen has tripled to more than 1,200. Sellers of vaccines appear to be from the US, UK, Spain, Germany, France and Russia.Â The team found multiple adverts in Russian cyrillic text as well as in English. The vaccines advertised include the Oxford-AstraZeneca at $500, and Johnson & Johnson and Sputnik each at $600, and Sinopharm at $750. One seller is offering next-day delivery, saying: ""For overnight delivery/emergency leave us a message.""' Another advert on a hacking forum is offering fake negative tests and reads: ""We do negative Covid tests, for travellers abroad, for getting a job etc. Buy two negative tests and get the third for free!"" Vaccination passports and papers are being offered to let people travel freely who've not been jabbed Some holiday operators require vaccination certificates for passengers. A vaccine passport system is also being considered in the UK and could be used to allow visitors entry to venues such as bars, or sports stadiums. European officialshave also announced plans for a ""Green Digital Certificate"".This would allow anyone vaccinated against Covid, or who has tested negative, or recently recovered from the virus, to travel within the EU. This video can not be played Technology explained: What is the dark web? It's no surprise then that faked documents are being offered on the darknet for sale. Check Point investigators found many sellers offering forged documents, including one supposedly from the UK, with a vaccination card for $150 using the hard-to-trace cryptocurrency Bitcoin as the payment method. When they got in touch with the seller, the team were told that they just needed to provide their names and some dates for when the fake jabs occurred. The seller messaged: ""You don't have to worryâ¦it's our jobâ¦.we have done this to many people and it's all good."" Police break up 'fake Covid-19 vaccine network' Will I need a vaccine passport to go out or travel? Oded Vanunu, head of product vulnerabilities research at Check Point said:Â ""It's imperative for people to understand that attempting to obtain a vaccine, a vaccination card or negative Covid-19 test result by unofficial means is extremely risky, as hackers are more interested in your money, information and identity for exploitation."" Mr Vanunu also told the BBC that his team purchased a dose of the Sinopharm vaccine from a vendor for $750 as part of their research, but are yet to receive it. His team has told the BBC that they believe this seller was a scammer, but say others may or may not be selling real vaccines. Check Point is urging countries to adopt a QR code system across all vaccine documentation to make forgeries more difficult.

Here's a recap: Health care assistant Chellen Chellamboye lights a candle outside the Old House at Home pub in Dormansland, Surrey Further along the street, residents came out with their candles and dogs Trafalgar Square was among the landmarks lit up on Tuesday evening St Mary's Lighthouse in Northumberland was also illuminated Prime Minister Boris Johnson has told the 1922 Committee of backbench Conservative MPs that the UK had got a successful vaccine quickly because of ""capitalism"" and ""greed"". Sources at the meeting said the PM then very insistently withdrew the comments and it is also understood Mr Johnson spent much of the discussion emphasising the fact that drug giant AstraZeneca is providing the Oxford vaccine at cost. The comments were firstreported by the Sun newspaper,external. A Downing Street spokesman declined to comment on a private meeting. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and former health secretary Jeremy Hunt are among the public figures who have shared pictures of burning candles tonight. It's part of the ""beacon of remembrance"" event which has encouraged people to light candles at their windows and doorsteps to commemorate those who have died from the virus. Ms Sturgeon shared a photo on Twitter, as did Mr Hunt who addressed the families of the 126,284 people who have died, saying: ""Our thoughts and prayers are with you tonight."" Other MPs also lit candles, including Labour shadow cabinet office minister Rachel Reeves who tweeted: ""Tonight, Iâve lit a candle to connect with those grieving, and remember those sadly lost in the pandemic.""

As landmarks and buildings were illuminated, so too were doorsteps as thousands lit candles to remember those lost during the pandemic. Neighbours spoke to each other over a glass of wine in Fulham, west London People had been encouraged to light up their doorsteps on Tuesday evening Holly Wilson, whose grandmother Ada Wilson passed away during the pandemic, lit a candle at Belfast Cathedral There was a sombre reflection for those lost during the pandemic in Dormansland, Surrey A woman lit a candle outside an illuminated Lichfield Cathedral in Staffordshire At No 10 Downing Street, a staff member was seen placing a candle on the doorstep for the 20:00 vigil. As millions remember those who have died as a result of the pandemic in the UK with candles, torches and phones on the doorsteps, buildings across the country have also been lit up in remembrance. Sunderland's Northern Spire Bridge looked striking as it was lit up at nightfall The iconic Kelpies sculpture in Falkirk is also lit up In the capital, the London Eye was among the landmarks illuminated Meanwhile, the outside of Lichfield Cathedral bore the words ""Reflect, Support, Hope"". Inside the cathedral, candles were lit In Cardiff, the castle in the city centre was lit up And the clock tower at Cardiff's Roath Park lake was also lit up in yellow The focus of today has been looking back on the past year and remembering those who have died with coronavirus. Earlier, Boris Johnson said there will come a moment where the UK can create a permanent memorial to the dead. But this evening, buildings are being lit up and people will stand on their doorsteps and light up their windows with candles and torchlight. If you want to read about some of the people we are remembering ahead of tonight's vigil, thenwe've got a tribute page here. To see tributes to all of the people who have died would take more than 312 hours. So we have gathered words of remembrance from friends, family and colleagues to remember more than 750 of those who have died. Candles have already been lit at places of worship across the country, including Lichfield Cathedral Remembrance events are set to continue in cities across the UK tonight to mark the anniversary of lockdown and commemorate all those who have died with the virus. This evening people are being encouraged to stand on their doorsteps with candles, torches or light shone from their phones. It's due to happen at 20:00 - the same time that people used to stand at their doorsteps for the clap for carers - and it's been called a ""beacon of remembrance"". Buildings across the UK are also going to be illuminated at nightfall. London's skyline will turn yellow with landmarks including the London Eye, Trafalgar Square and Wembley Stadium lighting up. Cardiff Castle and Belfast City Hall will also be lit up, while churches and cathedrals will toll bells, light thousands of candles and offer prayers. Intensive care units in Brazil are struggling to cope with a new influx of patients Coronavirus continues to
surge ""dangerously"" across Brazil, the World Health
Organization's regional director for the Americas has warned. Carissa
Etienne urged all Brazilians to adopt
preventative measures to stop the spread of the virus. ""Unfortunately, the dire situation in Brazil is also
affecting neighbouring countries,"" Etienne, director of the Pan
American Health Organization, said in a briefing. She
said cases have risen in Venezuela's Bolivar and Amazonas
states, and in border regions of Peru and Bolivia. Last week, Brazil's leadinghealth institute, Fiocruz, warned of an historic collapse of the country's health service. It said intensive care units in hospitals were running out of capacity. Covid ""certificates"" could be used to help people return to large gatherings such as sporting events, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden has previously said. But what are they? In the UK, anyone who has had a jab receives a vaccination card and the details go on their medical records. Now, the UK is among a number of countries considering whether to introduce other ways of confirming that people have been vaccinated. It's been suggested a passport feature could be added to the existing NHS app. People could use it to prove they have been vaccinated or recently tested negative. European officials have announced plans for a ""Green Digital Certificate,external"". This would allow anyone vaccinated against Covid, or who has tested negative, or recently recovered from the virus, to travel within the EU. Officials hope it will be in place before the summer tourist season. However, some EU members have expressed concerns the certificate could be discriminatory. And in the UK, apetition asking the government not to introduce vaccine passportswill be considered for a debate by MPs. Read more Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The vaccination programme is going well, but once again we
are being reminded of the threat of a third wave. Both the prime ministers and his senior advisers made
reference to it. With restrictions lifting, cases are likely to go up â
although there is hope the change in seasons will help limit those rises. Over half of adults are vaccinated, but that still leaves
many millions susceptible. Some will be in the vulnerable groups â either because they
have chosen not to take up the vaccine or because it has not worked. That means people will still die just as they do from flu
each year. In a bad winter, there can be more than 20,000 flu deaths. Modelling suggests with the vaccine rollout and a careful
lifting of restrictions there could be 30,000 Covid deaths by summer 2022. But the governmentâs advisers made clear there really is no
other option, saying there is âclose to zero chanceâ of zero Covid for a virus
that spreads so easily, often undetected because so many do not even develop
symptoms. The challenge now is managing that risk. BBC Radio 4 Today presenter Nick Robinson is in Newcastle upon Tyne, where the BBC is hostingLockdown Live: What Next?- a special programme that marks a year since the first UK lockdown was announced. Here's what he's got to say: Stay safe the Toon. See you soon! That message above the entrance to the Everyman cinema on Newcastle's historic Grey Street is a reminder of what we're all missing. So too are the posters outside the Theatre Royal: ""There will be a short interval."" It is, however, the closed shutters on bars and cafes and restaurants that are really stark reminders. This street in a city that takes pride in its reputation as a party town would normally be filled with people having fun long into the night. There are signs, however, of a city preparing to open again. Come 12 April, people will be able to eat out and drink outside again, providing they're willing to wrap up warm and huddle beneath an outdoor heater. Bar Luga's owner Ollie Vaulkhard, a well-known entrepreneur in the city, is preparing to welcome people back on to his outdoor terrace. A third of people are still terrified of Covid, he tells me. A third couldn't care less and a third are persuadable. That, he believes, adds up to plenty of business. This pandemic has, he says, weeded out good businesses from the bad. He compares it to the meteorite that wiped out the dinosaurs but left others to take over the planet. Read the full piece here. Reality Check Englandâs chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty was
asked about the one thing he wished he had done differently. In the early stages of the pandemic, he said that they had
much less of an understanding about how widespread the virus was in Europe - âwe
now know the amounts of importation there were from Spain, from France and from
bits of Italyâ¦but at the time we didnât have that information and that would
almost certainly have led to slightly different approaches to how we did
things.â Between January and mid-March 2020, the
focus was on quarantine measures on people arriving from Wuhan in China. But a study subsequently found that the virus was
introduced to the UK ""well over a thousand times in early 2020"", with
a third of transmission chains brought in from Spain, followed by 29% from
France, neither of which faced any restrictions at the time. China accounted for just 0.4% of imported cases. Early in the pandemic, the Sage group of scientists which
advises the government, did not think that blocking international travel was a
feasible option. At a meeting in February 2020,,externalSage suggested that
cutting the number of infections entering the UK by half would only delay the
epidemic by five days. It estimated that a 95%
reduction in imported cases, requiring ""draconian"" travel
restrictions, would have pushed things back by a month. Read more here. Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent As we inch towards summer many
people want to know whether they can realistically look to head off on
holiday abroad. Boris Johnson repeated the ministerial mantra that itâs ""too
early"" to say. However, he also said he hoped to give an update by 5 April - although itâs not clear how significant an announcement that will be. The
taskforce looking at international travel wasnât due to report until 12 April. Either way, the overall tone wasnât hugely optimistic as the prime minister
also said that things looked âdifficultâ for the time-being due to rising case
rates in parts of Europe. Read more about the new travel ruleshere. Deaths are below the usual levels for March, according to the most-recent weekly UK death registrations. The number of patients in hospital with coronavirus is continuing to fall, too. The most recent data showed there were 5,461 Covid patients in hospital, a number not seen since October. There were 112 new deaths within 28 days of a positive test reported on Tuesday, with 5,379 new cases. Another 329,897 people received a first vaccine dose. This video can not be played Earlier, in his No 10 press conference, Boris Johnson said it was ""thanks to all of you that we can continue on our roadmap to freedom"". He repeated the government's pledge to offer a vaccine dose to everyone aged over 50 by the middle of April, and to all adults by the end of July. ""And cautiously but irreversibly, step by step, jab by jab, this country is on the path to reclaiming our freedoms,"" he said. The prime minister has just finished giving a coronavirus
briefing from Downing Street on the anniversary of the first lockdown. Hereâs what was covered: Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,4.5927854e-15
"Waitrose said the change was inspired by a campaign by 10-year-old Skye from Gwynedd. Waitrose has said it will no longer sell children's magazines with plastic disposable toys to help tackle pollution. The retailer said the free plastic toys have a short lifespan and cannot easily be recycled. This comes amid calls from some of the children they are aimed at to stop giving away free plastic toys. Over the next eight weeks, it will be removing magazines containing the free toys from its shelves. Waitrose is urging publishers to replace ""pointless plastic"" with sustainable alternatives. It said the move was inspired by Skye, a 10-year-old from Gwynedd, who launched a campaign to persuade publishers to stop giving away the disposable toys in magazines. Plastic pollution: Fairbourne child's bid to ban toys in magazines Sisters petition McDonald's and Burger King for plastic toy ban ""I'm really pleased so many people have agreed with me and supported my petition - I want to thank everyone who has signed and shared my campaign to ban plastics from comics and magazines,"" Skye told the BBC. ""Thank you to Waitrose for agreeing with us and no longer selling the unwanted plastic tat. ""I hope all retailers can do the same and then the publishers will realise this is not acceptable anymore. We really like the magazines - we just don't want or need the plastic packaging or the cheap plastic toys."" The ban will not include educational or reusable craft items which are designed to be used multiple times, such as colouring pens and pencils, and collectable models. Marija Rompani, partner and director of sustainability and ethics at Waitrose, said: ""While we know these magazines are popular with children, some of the unnecessary plastic attached to them has become really excessive. This video can not be played In 2019, Ella (left) and Caitlin McEwan said they were ""amazed"" by Burger King's decision to stop including plastic toys in their children's meals ""Many in the younger generation really care about the planet and are the ones inheriting the problem of plastic pollution. ""We urge publishers to find alternatives, and other retailers to follow our lead in ending the pointless plastic that comes with children's magazines."" The retailer has written to magazine distributors giving them eight weeks' notice of the policy, asking for alternatives to plastic toys and warning that they will not sell copies which contain the disposable items. It is the latest move by the supermarket to cut down on single-use plastic, which has also seen it end the sale of Christmas crackers with plastic toys or glitter, and has a push to make all its own-label packaging recycled, reusable or home compostable. Children's plastics campaign's have been successful in the past. In 2019, Burger Kingstopped including plastic toys in their children's mealsand McDonald's gave children options of books with Happy Meals, after a campaign by two sisters.

"This video can not be played Emergency responders led people in the area to safety A gunman has killed 10 people, including a police officer, following an hours-long stand-off at a grocery store in the US state of Colorado. The attack in Boulder ended with police detaining an injured suspect at the King Soopers market. The shooting was live-streamed by witnesses and broadcast on YouTube. Among the dead was 51-year-old Eric Talley, who was the first police officer to respond to the shooting. ""This is a tragedy and a nightmare for Boulder County,"" the area's district attorney, Michael Dougherty, said. ""These were people going about their day, doing their shopping. I promise the victims and the people of the state of Colorado that we will secure justice."" No other details have been released about the nine other victims or a motive for the attack. The grocery store is located in a busy shopping plaza in Boulder, a north-central Colorado city about 30 miles (50km) away from the state capital of Denver. The supermarket attack comes less than a week aftera mass shooting that left eight dead, including six Asian women, at three spas in Atlanta. Atlanta shootings: How we talk about violence The silent epidemic of Americaâs problem with guns How the pandemic led to the highest-ever spike in US gun sales The incident began at about 14:30 local time (20:30 GMT) on Monday when the suspect entered the supermarket and began firing. Shoppers and employees of the store said they had to dive for cover or run to safety as the shooting unfolded. Some of the stand-off was captured on camera by a passer-by, showing victims near the grocery store. Customers and employees fled the store when the shooting began Dozens of FBI and SWAT officers were deployed to the scene ""I don't know what's going on... I heard gunshots, someone's down,"" the cameraman shouts. ""There's an active shooter, get away"". Gunshots can be heard as he runs away from the shop. The video continues, with police arriving on the scene and surrounding the market. The Boulder police department later warned people to avoid the area and told them not to ""broadcast on social media any tactical information you might see"". ""We were at the checkout, and shots just started going off,"" said Sarah Moonshadow, a customer caught up in the shooting with her son Nicholas. Sarah Moonshadow, who was inside the store when shooting began, being comforted by two others outside the store She told Reuters she had tried to help one of the victims lying on the pavement outside the store, but her son pulled her away saying ""we have to go"". ""I couldn't help anybody,"" she said. Ryan Borowski, who was also inside the store, told CNN he could not believe what had happened in his town: ""This feels like the safest spot in America, and I just nearly got killed for getting a soda and a bag of chips."" Eyewitnesses said the suspect was armed with a rifle. A police source told CNN it was an AR-15 style rifle, a semi-automatic gun that has been used in several mass shootings across the US. Aerial footage later showed a handcuffed, shirtless man with an apparent injury to his leg being put onto a stretcher for treatment. Authorities did not say whether he was the suspect or not. Speaking at a press conference, Boulder police chief Maris Herold confirmed that a suspect was in custody and was receiving hospital treatment. ""I want to reassure the community that they are safe,"" she said. Ms Herold named the officer killed as Eric Talley, a father of seven who had been with the Boulder Police Department since 2010.

""The heroic action of this officer when he responded to the scene... phone calls of shots fired in the area and a phone call about a possible person with a patrol rifle,"" she said. Ms Herold did not provide further details about the shooting, but said that the investigation was ""very complex"" and would take ""no less than five days to complete"". The names of the other victims will not be released until relatives have been informed. ""Today we saw the face of evil. I am grieving with my community and all Coloradans,"" tweeted Colorado Governor Jared Polis. The supermarket shooting was the seventh mass killing so far this year following a lull in mass killings during the pandemic last year, according to a database compiled by the Associated Press (AP), USA Today and Northeastern University. The database defines mass killings as four or more dead. It has already led to renewed calls for tighter gun controls in the US, a starkly divisive issue that has seen little in the way of change over the years despite hundreds of mass shootings. Former Arizona congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, a gun control advocate who was seriously injured in a mass shooting in 2011, said: ""It's been 10 years and countless communities have faced something similar... this is not normal.""

Responding to the news, US Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said on Twitter: ""This Senate must and will move forward on legislation to help stop the epidemic of gun violence."" President Joe Biden, who has been briefed about the latest attack, said last month he would be recommending tougher legislation to ensure background checks on anyone wishing to purchase a firearm. Freshman Republican Congresswoman Lauren Boebert, a staunch defender of gun rights, tweeted that she was ""praying for the police, first responders, and those affected by this tragedy"". The right to bear arms is protected by the Second Amendment to the US constitution and is staunchly defended by many conservatives, including ex-president Donald Trump. The state of Colorado has seen a number of mass shootings over the last few decades, including the 1999 Columbine High School attack that left 12 students and a teacher dead and the 2012 attack at a cinema in Aurora that killed 12 people.

"Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey Twitter founder Jack Dorsey's first ever tweet has been sold for the equivalent of $2.9m (Â£2.1m) to a Malaysia-based businessman. The tweet, which said ""just setting up my twttr,"" was first published on March 21, 2006 and was auctioned off by Mr Dorsey for charity. The Malaysia-based buyer Sina Estavi compared the purchase to buying a Mona Lisa painting. The tweet was bought using the ether cryptocurrency, a rival to bitcoin.

It was sold as a nonfungible token (NFT) on Monday to Mr Estavi, the chief executive of technology firm Bridge Oracle. An NFT is a unique digital certificate that states who owns a photo, video or other form of online media. Each NFT is unique and acts as a collector's item that can't be duplicated, making them rare by design. NFTs have become hugely popular this year, with expensive digital artwork also being sold this way. Mr Dorsey said he would convert the proceeds to bitcoin and then donate them to the Give Directly's Africa Response fund. ""This is not just a tweet!"" Mr Estavi posted on Twitter.

Mr Dorsey's brief tweet was sold via an auction on an online platform called Valuables, which is owned by the US-based company Cent. Under the platform's rules, Mr Dorsey receives 95% of the proceeds of the primary sale, while Cent receives 5%. But the post will remain publicly available on Twitter even after it has been auctioned off. Within minutes of the auction bids reached more than $88,000. As the buyer, Mr Estavi will receive a certificate, digitally signed and verified by Mr Dorsey, as well as the metadata of the original tweet. The data will include information such as the time the tweet was posted and its text contents. Social media experts predict the sale of tweets and other online posts will become more popular. ""We live in an age where celebrities, musicians and influencers have more than fans, they have stans, and they will want to own a piece of their favourite stars,"" said Cathy Hackl, founder of technology consultancy Futures Intelligence Group. ""Just like people buy physical memorabilia, they will buy their tweets, posts, and snaps because they want to feel close to that star"".

Earlier this month, the first digital-only art auction was held by Christie's auction house and netted $69m for the artist Beeple. Beeple - real name Mike Winkelmann - creates a new piece of digital art every day, and was selling the first 5,000 days (13 years) of his work. ""This is a watershed moment and proof of concept for digital art, which has been dogged by questions of commercial value, authenticity, ownership and scarcity,"" said Rob Anders, boss of Israel-based digital art platform Niio.

The supermarket shooting was the seventh mass killing so far this year following a lull in mass killings during the pandemic last year, according to a database compiled by the Associated Press (AP), USA Today and Northeastern University. The database defines mass killings as four or more dead. It has already led to renewed calls for tighter gun controls in the US, a starkly divisive issue that has seen little in the way of change over the years despite hundreds of mass shootings. Former Arizona congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, a gun control advocate who was seriously injured in a mass shooting in 2011, said: ""It's been 10 years and countless communities have faced something similar... this is not normal.""

"Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey Twitter founder Jack Dorsey's first ever tweet has been sold for the equivalent of $2.9m (Â£2.1m) to a Malaysia-based businessman. The tweet, which said ""just setting up my twttr,"" was first published on March 21, 2006 and was auctioned off by Mr Dorsey for charity. The Malaysia-based buyer Sina Estavi compared the purchase to buying a Mona Lisa painting. The tweet was bought using the ether cryptocurrency, a rival to bitcoin. Bids top $2.5m for Jack Dorsey's first tweet Twitter boss donates $15m to poorer families fund What are NFTs and why are some worth millions? It was sold as a nonfungible token (NFT) on Monday to Mr Estavi, the chief executive of technology firm Bridge Oracle. An NFT is a unique digital certificate that states who owns a photo, video or other form of online media. Each NFT is unique and acts as a collector's item that can't be duplicated, making them rare by design. NFTs have become hugely popular this year, with expensive digital artwork also being sold this way. Mr Dorsey said he would convert the proceeds to bitcoin and then donate them to the Give Directly's Africa Response fund. ""This is not just a tweet!"" Mr Estavi posted on Twitter. ""I think years later people will realize the true value of this tweet, like the Mona Lisa painting."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Dorsey's brief tweet was sold via an auction on an online platform called Valuables, which is owned by the US-based company Cent. Under the platform's rules, Mr Dorsey receives 95% of the proceeds of the primary sale, while Cent receives 5%. But the post will remain publicly available on Twitter even after it has been auctioned off. Within minutes of the auction bids reached more than $88,000. As the buyer, Mr Estavi will receive a certificate, digitally signed and verified by Mr Dorsey, as well as the metadata of the original tweet. The data will include information such as the time the tweet was posted and its text contents. Social media experts predict the sale of tweets and other online posts will become more popular. ""We live in an age where celebrities, musicians and influencers have more than fans, they have stans, and they will want to own a piece of their favourite stars,"" said Cathy Hackl, founder of technology consultancy Futures Intelligence Group. ""Just like people buy physical memorabilia, they will buy their tweets, posts, and snaps because they want to feel close to that star"".

Earlier this month, the first digital-only art auction was held by Christie's auction house and netted $69m for the artist Beeple. Beeple - real name Mike Winkelmann - creates a new piece of digital art every day, and was selling the first 5,000 days (13 years) of his work. ""This is a watershed moment and proof of concept for digital art, which has been dogged by questions of commercial value, authenticity, ownership and scarcity,"" said Rob Anders, boss of Israel-based digital art platform Niio.

"Guy Brice Parfait KolÃ©las was one of six opposition candidates The leading opposition presidential candidate in Congo-Brazzaville, who was seriously ill with Covid-19, has died hours after polls closed. Guy-Brice Parfait KolÃ©las died on a plane taking him to France for treatment, his campaign director said. Hours earlier the 61-year-old had appeared in a video shared on social media, where he removed his oxygen mask and told his supporters that he was ""fighting death"". He urged them to vote in Sunday's poll. The electoral law doesn't annul the election if one of the candidates dies. French prosecutors announced a criminal investigation into the cause of Mr KolÃ©las's death. His body has not yet been repatriated. Mr KolÃ©las, who was diabetic, was one of six candidates running against President Denis Sassou Nguesso, 77, who has been in power since 1979, except for a five-year period after losing elections in 1992. Congo-Brazzavile has officially recorded more than 9,000 cases of Covid-19 and 130 deaths. The country has imposed a night-time curfew in the two main cities of Brazzaville and Pointe-Noire and closed its borders due to the pandemic. However, campaign rallies were allowed, with not much sign of people respecting social distancing or wearing masks. Africa Live: Updates on this and other stories from the continent Who is getting the vaccine in Africa? A quick guide to Congo-Brazzaville Congo's sapeurs pass their style on Mr KolÃ©las had missed his final campaign event on Friday after saying a day earlier that he feared he had malaria, the Associated Press news agency reports. He was admitted to a private hospital in the capital, Brazzaville, and it was later confirmed that he had Covid-19. Speaking in French from his hospital bed, Mr KolÃ©las said: ""My dear compatriots, I am in trouble. I am fighting death. However, I ask you to stand up and vote for change. I would not have fought for nothing."" ""Rise up as one person... I'm fighting on my deathbed, you too fight for your change,"" he urged his supporters, saying the election was ""about the future of your children."" Allow Twitter content?

The head of the government's Covid-19 response team, Elira Dokekias, said that Mr KolÃ©las' condition had been serious on Saturday, the Associated Press reports. After casting his ballot in the capital, Mr Sassou Nguesso had wished the former fisheries minister and son of former Prime Minister Benard KolÃ©las, a swift recovery. The president's supporters were out on the streets as he cast his ballot A large crowd gathered on Sunday to catch a glimpse of the president, with many people not wearing masks and failing to adhere to social distancing rules. Mr Sasou Nguessou beat Mr KolÃ©las in the last election in 2016, obtaining 60% of the vote compared with his rival's 15%. The watchdog group NetBlocks reported that the internet had been shut down ahead of Sunday's voting. President Sassou Nguesso wore a mask when he went to vote The largest opposition party, the Pan-African Union for Social Democracy (UPADS), is boycotting the election, saying it fears the poll could divide the nation. Congo-Brazzaville's Catholic Church episcopal conference has said it has ""serious reservations"" about the election's transparency. Analysis by Emery Makumeno, BBC News Mr KolÃ©las could have had an easy life, he was a government minister enjoying the perks that comes with being a top official but he gave all that up to challenge President Sassou Nguesso. His death has robbed Congo's opposition of a tireless campaigner for democracy and has blighted the opposition's chances of a serious challenge for the presidency. What is certain is that there will not be any speculation about what Mr KolÃ©las thought about the state of the country in his last moments - he chose to record a personal message to Congolese urging them to continue fighting for democracy. He came second in the 2016 presidential election, but even in a poll which many see as a foregone conclusion, how Mr KolÃ©las performs, even in death, will still be closely watched.

"Waitrose said the change was inspired by a campaign by 10-year-old Skye from Gwynedd. Waitrose has said it will no longer sell children's magazines with plastic disposable toys to help tackle pollution. The retailer said the free plastic toys have a short lifespan and cannot easily be recycled. This comes amid calls from some of the children they are aimed at to stop giving away free plastic toys. Over the next eight weeks, it will be removing magazines containing the free toys from its shelves. Waitrose is urging publishers to replace ""pointless plastic"" with sustainable alternatives. It said the move was inspired by Skye, a 10-year-old from Gwynedd, who launched a campaign to persuade publishers to stop giving away the disposable toys in magazines. Plastic pollution: Fairbourne child's bid to ban toys in magazines Sisters petition McDonald's and Burger King for plastic toy ban ""I'm really pleased so many people have agreed with me and supported my petition - I want to thank everyone who has signed and shared my campaign to ban plastics from comics and magazines,"" Skye told the BBC. ""Thank you to Waitrose for agreeing with us and no longer selling the unwanted plastic tat. ""I hope all retailers can do the same and then the publishers will realise this is not acceptable anymore. We really like the magazines - we just don't want or need the plastic packaging or the cheap plastic toys."" The ban will not include educational or reusable craft items which are designed to be used multiple times, such as colouring pens and pencils, and collectable models. Marija Rompani, partner and director of sustainability and ethics at Waitrose, said: ""While we know these magazines are popular with children, some of the unnecessary plastic attached to them has become really excessive. This video can not be played In 2019, Ella (left) and Caitlin McEwan said they were ""amazed"" by Burger King's decision to stop including plastic toys in their children's meals ""Many in the younger generation really care about the planet and are the ones inheriting the problem of plastic pollution. ""We urge publishers to find alternatives, and other retailers to follow our lead in ending the pointless plastic that comes with children's magazines."" The retailer has written to magazine distributors giving them eight weeks' notice of the policy, asking for alternatives to plastic toys and warning that they will not sell copies which contain the disposable items. It is the latest move by the supermarket to cut down on single-use plastic, which has also seen it end the sale of Christmas crackers with plastic toys or glitter, and has a push to make all its own-label packaging recycled, reusable or home compostable. Children's plastics campaign's have been successful in the past. In 2019, Burger Kingstopped including plastic toys in their children's mealsand McDonald's gave children options of books with Happy Meals, after a campaign by two sisters.

"This video can not be played Emergency responders led people in the area to safety A gunman has killed 10 people, including a police officer, following an hours-long stand-off at a grocery store in the US state of Colorado. The attack in Boulder ended with police detaining an injured suspect at the King Soopers market. The shooting was live-streamed by witnesses and broadcast on YouTube. Among the dead was 51-year-old Eric Talley, who was the first police officer to respond to the shooting. ""This is a tragedy and a nightmare for Boulder County,"" the area's district attorney, Michael Dougherty, said. ""These were people going about their day, doing their shopping. I promise the victims and the people of the state of Colorado that we will secure justice."" No other details have been released about the nine other victims or a motive for the attack. The grocery store is located in a busy shopping plaza in Boulder, a north-central Colorado city about 30 miles (50km) away from the state capital of Denver. The supermarket attack comes less than a week aftera mass shooting that left eight dead, including six Asian women, at three spas in Atlanta. Atlanta shootings: How we talk about violence The silent epidemic of Americaâs problem with guns How the pandemic led to the highest-ever spike in US gun sales The incident began at about 14:30 local time (20:30 GMT) on Monday when the suspect entered the supermarket and began firing. Shoppers and employees of the store said they had to dive for cover or run to safety as the shooting unfolded. Some of the stand-off was captured on camera by a passer-by, showing victims near the grocery store. Customers and employees fled the store when the shooting began Dozens of FBI and SWAT officers were deployed to the scene ""I don't know what's going on... I heard gunshots, someone's down,"" the cameraman shouts. ""There's an active shooter, get away"". Gunshots can be heard as he runs away from the shop. The video continues, with police arriving on the scene and surrounding the market. The Boulder police department later warned people to avoid the area and told them not to ""broadcast on social media any tactical information you might see"". ""We were at the checkout, and shots just started going off,"" said Sarah Moonshadow, a customer caught up in the shooting with her son Nicholas. Sarah Moonshadow, who was inside the store when shooting began, being comforted by two others outside the store She told Reuters she had tried to help one of the victims lying on the pavement outside the store, but her son pulled her away saying ""we have to go"". ""I couldn't help anybody,"" she said. Ryan Borowski, who was also inside the store, told CNN he could not believe what had happened in his town: ""This feels like the safest spot in America, and I just nearly got killed for getting a soda and a bag of chips."" Eyewitnesses said the suspect was armed with a rifle. A police source told CNN it was an AR-15 style rifle, a semi-automatic gun that has been used in several mass shootings across the US. Aerial footage later showed a handcuffed, shirtless man with an apparent injury to his leg being put onto a stretcher for treatment. Authorities did not say whether he was the suspect or not. Speaking at a press conference, Boulder police chief Maris Herold confirmed that a suspect was in custody and was receiving hospital treatment. ""I want to reassure the community that they are safe,"" she said. Ms Herold named the officer killed as Eric Talley, a father of seven who had been with the Boulder Police Department since 2010.
