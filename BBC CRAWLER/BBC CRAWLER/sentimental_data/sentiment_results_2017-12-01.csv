"Parents who have a different surname to their children have felt ""humiliated"" at British ports by ""over-zealous"" border officials, MPs have heard. Labour's Tulip Siddiq said she faced an ""air of suspicion"" after a holiday, as her daughter has her father's name. She said if Brexit was to bring new passports, it would be a good time to ""iron out"" difficulties and include parents' names on children's passports. The government said it would ""actively consider"" how to tackle the issue. But Home Office minister Nick Hurd warned there were ""formidable difficulties"" with what was being proposed. Ms Siddiq, MP for Hampstead and Kilburn, said a ""growing number of parents in the UK"" found holidays being ""blighted by confrontations that are both unnecessary and entirely avoidable"". In a Commons debate on Friday, she described being stopped at the UK border before boarding Eurostar, after a trip to France, having been separated from her husband. Pushing her 18-month-old daughter in a pram, she found herself being questioned about her identity. ""To my shock, the situation became quite tense. The official kept asking me for more and more documentation which I did not have and I explained over and over again that the child had my husband's last name, not my last name. ""My daughter was saying 'mama, mama' and crying because the unfortunate incident took so long, but even that didn't seem to convince the border official. ""My problem was that there was a real air of suspicion and I was made to feel like I was doing something wrong when I had just gone on holiday with my daughter and husband."" She said it was not only women travelling with their children but foster parents and ""numerous LGBT couples"" travelling with adopted children who had contacted her having been ""questioned mercilessly"" at borders. She said she did not want to compromise the efforts of Border Force to tackle child trafficking, but ""thousands of British parents"" had been ""unduly harassed and interrogated by officials at the UK border"". One constituent returned to Gatwick from a holiday with her eldest daughter from a previous marriage who had special needs. The girl  was asked ""is this your mother?"". She told Ms Siddiq it had been a ""painful"" experience ""genuinely thinking that our re-entry to the UK depended on my daughter, who has minimal cognitive ability"". Another had been left ""humiliated"" at Stansted when border officials ""refused to believe"" her 12-year-old was her daughter. ""These stories are the tip of the iceberg,"" said Ms Siddiq. ""Children's passports were introduced in the 1990s and list the child's name, and date and place of birth only. It is high time that they were updated to reflect the changing circumstances of British families."" She said both parents' names could be included on children's passports which would save ""time, confusion and ultimately money at border control"". Children should be able to grow up knowing their identity was one of their choosing and ""does not leave them treated by over-zealous border officials as criminals"", she added. Mr Hurd, a father of six, said he understood the challenge of travelling with small children and that the border system should not be doing anything to exacerbate parents' ""stress"". He said it was ""not in doubt"" that many people felt a grievance about the issue, but there were occasions where children were taken across borders which ""gave rise to safeguarding concerns"", and ""reasonable steps"" were needed to avoid putting children at risk. Questioning by Border Force officials was done ""with the best of motives"". Even if children's passports contained parents' names ""it would not provide conclusive evidence to a border officer that the person accompanying the child had the right to do so or was acting in the best interest of the child"". But Mr Hurd said: ""Having spoken to the immigration minister, I know that he does understand the present situation is causing difficulties, particularly in cases where children have different surnames to a parent. ""Therefore I am happy to give her the commitment on his behalf that he is going to actively consider how we can take this forward."" The Home Office's advice on the subject,externalsays it would help single parents with a different surname to their child to have a marriage or divorce certificate with them.

"Police in the German city of Potsdam are investigating a device filled with nails found next to a Christmas market. The device, that also held batteries and wires, was sent to a pharmacy in the city south-west of Berlin. Police initially said there were explosives inside, but then clarified there was no detonator. Germany is on a heightened terror alert, a year after 12 people died in an Islamist attack at a Berlin Christmas market. The device was found near Brandenburgerstrasse in the centre of Potsdam, which has a number of other Christmas markets. A police spokesman said an X-ray scan was conducted on the device, which found that it had nails inside. It was then made safe. The Interior Minister for Brandenburg, Karl-Heinz SchrÃ¶ter, said police were searching the area in case more devices were sent. ""We just don't know at this point if this was a device that could have actually exploded, or a fake, or a test,"" he said. More than 2,600 Christmas markets opened across Germany on Monday. They bring in an estimated Â£2bn (â¬2.3bn; $2.7bn) of business a year. There is an increased police presence in city centres this year and car barriers have been put up around some Christmas markets. Germany's interior ministry said this week that the risk of an attack on its territory or in Europe was ""continuously high"". In last December's Berlin Christmas market attack, Anis Amri, a Tunisian asylum seeker, hijacked a lorry and killed its driver before ramming it into shoppers, killing another 11 people.

"The British government has issued a fresh warning about the security risks of using Russian anti-virus software. The National Cyber Security Centre is to write to all government departments warning against using the products for systems related to national security. The UK cyber-security agency will say the software could be exploited by the Russian government. Security firm Kaspersky Labs, accused in the US of being used by the Russian state for espionage, denied wrongdoing. Kaspersky Labs is widely used by consumers and businesses across the globe, although they are not being advised to stop using the software, as well as by some parts of the UK government. Officials stress they are not recommending members of the public or companies stop using Kaspersky products, which are used by about 400 million people globally. Barclays hasstopped offering free Kaspersky software to customersas a ""precautionary decision"". On Saturday, the UK bank emailed 290,000 online banking customers who had downloaded Kaspersky over the past decade - but advised those with the software already installed to take no action. A Barclays spokesman said: ""Even though this new guidance isn't directed at members of the public, we have taken the decision to withdraw the offer."" Kaspersky defends its role in NSA breach Russian security firm Kaspersky denies spy agency work For it to work, anti-virus software like that sold by Kaspersky Labs requires extensive access to files on computers and networks to scan for malicious code. It also requires the ability to communicate back to the company in order to receive updates and share data on what it finds. However, the concern is that this could be used by the Russian state for espionage. Officials say the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC)'s decision is based on a risk analysis, rather than evidence that such espionage has already taken place. In the new government guidance, Ian Levy, NCSC's technical director, said: ""Given we assess the Russians do cyber-attacks against the UK for reasons of state, we believe some UK government and critical national systems are at increased risk."" The NCSC is understood to have been in dialogue with Kaspersky Labs and says it will explore ways of mitigating the risks to see if a system can be developed to independently verify the security of its products. It comes amid heightened concern about Russian activity against the UK. Last month, Prime Minister Theresa May warned the Russian state was acting against the UK's national interest in cyberspace. Following her warning, Ciaran Martin, chief executive of the NCSC, said Russia had targeted British infrastructure, including power and telecoms. Eugene Kaspersky ""Beyond this relatively small number of systems, we see no compelling case at present to extend that advice to the wider public sector, more general enterprises, or individuals,"" Mr Levy said. ""Whatever you do, don't panic. ""For example, we really don't want people doing things like ripping out Kaspersky software at large as it makes little sense."" Kaspersky has faced a series of accusations in the US press in recent months. It responded to one claim, that it downloaded classified US material from a home computer in the US, by presenting a detailed explanation of what took place. It has always said there is no truth to the claims. Earlier this week, Eugene Kaspersky, chief executive and co-founder of the company, told me: ""We don't do anything wrong. We would never do that. It's simply not possible."" He denied claims the Russian state could use the company. ""It's not true that the Russian state has access to the data. There are no facts about that,"" he added. Mr Kaspersky said that if he was ever asked by the Russian state to hand over data he would move his company out of the country.

"This video can not be played After Flynn's guilty plea, what next for the Russia investigation? Special Counsel Robert Mueller just dropped the hammer. Again. On Friday it was Michael Flynn's turn ""in the barrel"", to borrow a line from Trump confidant Roger Stone. The former national security adviser pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about December 2016 conversations he had with Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak and pledged to ""fully co-operate"" with Mr Mueller's ongoing investigations. Mr Flynn has admitted he misled the FBI about his discussions regarding new sanctions imposed on Russia by the Obama administration following evidence of alleged meddling in the 2016 election. There had been hints this was coming, after word last week that Mr Flynn's defence lawyers had stopped co-operating with the Trump legal team. The president's own scattershot behaviour on Twitter this week could also have been a key tell, like a trick knee acting up before a big storm. So why is this being billed as a major development in the ongoing investigation into possible Trump campaign ties to Russia? Let us count the ways. 1)Trump's inner circle has been breached It is difficult to overstate the significance of this felony plea deal. Mr Flynn was a close adviser and confidant of Mr Trump throughout the 2016 presidential race. He was a surrogate for the candidate on television and enjoyed a prominent speaking role at the July Republican National Convention. He had a pivotal role in Mr Trump's presidential transition. The role of national security adviser in the White House, which Mr Flynn assumed upon Mr Trump's inauguration, is one of the most senior positions in any administration, responsible for being the key conduit between the sprawling US military and intelligence bureaucracies and the president. It is a post that has been held by the likes of Henry Kissinger, Zbigniew Brzezinski, Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice. Mr Trump was so partial to Mr Flynn that he was praising him as a ""wonderful man"" who had been ""treated very, very unfairly by the media"" just days after firing him. Now Mr Flynn could be going to jail - and, more importantly, could be sharing damaging information about the Trump inner circle he inhabited for so long. 2)Flynn is talking According to the ""Statement of the Offense"" filed by the special counsel's office, Mr Flynn is testifying that he had contact with Trump transition team officials before and after his fateful December 2016 conversation with Ambassador Kislyak. ""Members of the transition team,"" the document relates, ""did not want Russia to escalate the situation after the Obama administration imposed new sanctions on the Russian government"". These conversations came more than a month after Mr Trump had won the presidency. Mr Flynn had already been announced as the national security adviser in the incoming White House - a top post in the president's inner circle. The next big question is who exactly were the unnamed senior members of the presidential transition team. Some US news outlets are naming Jared Kushner and former Deputy National Security Adviser KT McFarland. Others seem to indicate it was Mr Trump himself. Eventually, Mr Flynn - and Mr Mueller - will have to lay their cards on the table. 3) Flynn is contradicting the White House line Mr Flynn's assertions about his conversations with the transition team run directly counter to statements made by Mr Trump in a February press conference in which he said Mr Flynn was acting against orders when he reached out to Mr Kislyak. In fact the White House said at the time that the president dismissed Mr Flynn as national security adviser because he lied to Vice-President Mike Pence about his Russian contacts. The true nature of Mr Flynn's conversations with Mr Kislyak first came out thanks to leaks to the press of information gleaned from government surveillance of Mr Kislyak. If Mr Flynn has evidence corroborating his account of December contacts with the Trump transition team - which was headed by Mr Pence himself - the White House's explanation for its handling of the Flynn situation, denials of knowledge and all, starts to crumble. Mr Flynn appeared in court in front of Judge Rudolph Contreras Anyone in the president's inner circle who told the FBI or Mr Mueller's investigators that they weren't privy to Mr Flynn's activities, when there is evidence that they knew, would be open to another round of charges of lying to the FBI. The White House response, at least so far, seems to be that Mr Flynn is a lying liar who lies. ""The false statements involved mirror the false statements to White House officials which resulted in his resignation in February of this year,"" White House lawyer Ty Cobb wrote in a press statement. ""Nothing about the guilty plea or the charge implicates anyone other than Mr Flynn."" 4) Mr Mueller could be building an obstruction of justice case Dust off that old political saw that ""it's not the crime, it's the cover-up"". While Mr Flynn's contact with the Russian ambassador is questionable, given that he was undercutting Obama administration policy efforts, it is probably not illegal. What is illegal, however, is obstruction of justice. Former FBI Director James Comey has testified that on 14 February - the day after Mr Flynn was sacked - Mr Trump urged the director to back off his investigation into Mr Flynn during a private Oval Office meeting. If the president knew that the ongoing law-enforcement inquiry would discover Mr Flynn had been acting under orders - either by the president or a member of his transition team - that could be the kind of motive that would help support an obstruction of justice charge. This video can not be played How Michael Flynn became entangled in Russia probe 5) Only the tip of the iceberg? There were a lot of rumours and allegations floating around about Mr Flynn before Friday's plea deal news. The special counsel's office was reportedly looking into Mr Flynn's Obama-era work as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency. It was scrutinising his 2015 trip to Russia, paid for by the Kremlin-backed RT network, and his undisclosed lobbying on behalf of Turkish government interests. The charge brought against him, however, was solely related to his December 2016 phone conversations with Mr Kislyak. Although it comes with a possible five-year prison sentence, Mr Mueller hardly threw the book at the former national security adviser. Is this all there is? Mr Mueller is primarily tasked with investigating possible ties between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. Mr Flynn was a senior adviser to and advocate for Mr Trump's presidential bid. Does the relative modesty of the charges against Mr Flynn indicate he may be offering information directly relevant to this inquiry? 6) The independent counsel investigation is wide-ranging Mr Flynn's plea deal is just one piece of a much larger puzzle the special counsel office is trying to solve. In October Mr Mueller indicted former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort and Rick Gates, a top aide with White House ties, on money laundering charges predating their involvement with the Trump campaign. He also struck a plea deal with former foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos, who told prosecutors he lied about his own contacts with Russians. Each move is distinct and not directly related - at least not yet. A some point we are going to learn whether Mr Mueller is building a larger case against the Trump campaign out of these legal moves - or that the sum total of his efforts is nibbling around the edges. As the president likes to say, stay tuned.

"Around 25 Toys R Us stores could close if its new debt deal with creditors is approved Toys R Us is preparing to close around a quarter of its 106 UK stores, with the loss of hundreds of jobs, the BBC understands. The closures would form part of a deal to renegotiate debts owed by the company to its landlords - which must be agreed by 75% of its creditors. The toy giant, which has around 3,000 workers, is looking to move away from its ""big-box"" out-of-town store model. Christmas trading and gift cards are not expected to be affected. The company is seeking approval from its board and US parent company to enter talks with the landlords. Specialist restructuring firm Alvarez and Marsal is understood to be drafting a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) on its behalf. It hopes to strike a deal on Toys R Us's debts which will allow it to continue trading without being pursued for the money it owes. A Toys R Us spokesperson would not comment on the CVA proceedings, shop closures or job losses. The CVA process is separate to bankruptcy protection proceedings involving Toys R Us's US parent company, which were announced in September. Retail analyst Kate Hardcastle, from Insight With Passion, said the challenge facing Toys R Us is a common theme of retailers. ""Toy retailers, fashion retailers, everyone is going to reduce the size of their stores. It's coming. In the coming 24 months you will see a lot more of this sort of news,"" Ms Hardcastle said. Ms Hardcastle said Toys R Us was particularly exposed to the rise in e-commerce because customers are most comfortable buying toys and electronics online as they offer big-name, trusted brands. ""There isn't a bigger branded industry. If I'm buying Lego: Lego is Lego, is Lego"". ""Toys R Us has aisles and aisles stacked high with products, but they will never win that fight with the internet."" Ms Hardcastle said Toys R Us was stuck between the extensive range and lower pricing of online retail and the theatrics and free entertainment offered by toy stores such as Hamleys, Lego and Disney stores.

"Prince George is third in line to the throne A senior Anglican minister has been criticised for saying people should pray for Prince George to be gay to help the Church of England recognise same-sex marriage. The Very Reverend Kelvin Holdsworth wrote a blog post urging people to pray for him ""to be blessed one day with the love of a fine young gentleman"". His comments have been described as ""unkind"" and ""destructive"". Mr Holdsworth is provost of St Mary's Cathedral in Glasgow. He is from the Scottish Episcopal Church, whichvoted to allow gay couples to marryearlier this year. Same-sex marriages in Anglican churches are banned in England and Wales. In his blog post, Mr Holdsworth said that if Prince William's four-year-old son married another man in the future it would help the Church of England become more inclusive. ""A royal wedding might sort things out remarkably easily though we might have to wait 25 years for that to happen,"" he wrote. ""Who knows whether that might be sooner than things might work out by other means?"" Rev Holdsworth says Prince George being gay would help the Church to become more inclusive He told the BBC he first wrote the blog post more than a year ago but it gained traction after he tweeted it again following the news of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's engagement. ""This quote seems to be getting a lot of attention because it was picked up by a number of anti-gay campaigners in the Church of England,"" he said. ""It is a shame that the happy news about the royal wedding has been hijacked in this way."" Mr Holdsworth tweeted his blog post following Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's engagement Gavin Ashenden, a former chaplain to the Queen and a Christian Episcopal Church missionary bishop, said the comments were not Christian. ""To use prayer as a mechanism for wishing this on Prince George is an unkind and destructive thing to do,"" he told the BBC. ""It doesn't have the prince's best interests at heart, but uses him as a gender-political football to please 1.7% of the population. ""What is especially odd and incongruous is the fact that it is suddenly OK to pray for someone to be gay, but totally unacceptable to pray for them to be free from being gay and to resume a sexuality that was in tune with their biology. ""This seems not only contradictory but hypocritical."" Susie Leafe, the director of the conservative evangelical group Reform, was also critical of Mr Holdsworth's blog. ""I was very disappointed that he was prepared to bring a child in to this same-sex marriage debate,"" she told the BBC. ""As a Christian minister he should pray for all people to come to know the love of Christ, rather than a fine young gentleman."" The Church of England declined to comment on Mr Holdsworth's blog post as he is a member of the Scottish Episcopal Church. Rt Rev Dr Gregor Duncan, Bishop of Glasgow and Galloway, said:  ""The comments made by Provost Holdsworth were made on his personal blog. ""As his blog indicates, the views expressed there are his personal ones. ""They do not represent an official view of the Scottish Episcopal Church nor are they ones with which I would concur.  I will be discussing this matter with Provost Holdsworth."" What does Prince George want for Christmas?

"Donald Tusk was speaking after talks with the Irish prime minister in Dublin The UK's offer on Brexit must be acceptable to the Republic of Ireland before the negotiations can move on, the president of the European Council, Donald Tusk, has said. Mr Tusk was speaking after talks with the Irish prime minister in Dublin on Friday. He said: ""The UK's future lies - in some ways - in Dublin"".

"The vice-chancellor of Southampton University was awarded a pay package of Â£424,000 last year - Â£72,000 more than he earned the previous year. Accounts show Sir Christopher Snowden was paid Â£352,000 in 2015-16, during which he was in post for 10 months. The university said the extra reflected a full year's salary and the national higher education pay award of 1.1%. But Sally Hunt, of the University and College Union, criticised his decision to accept the pay rise. Ms Hunt, the union's general secretary, said the rise demonstrated ""once again how out of touch university vice-chancellors can be"". She said that Sir Christopher was ""already one of the best-paid vice-chancellors in the UK, on a salary that had been publicly questioned by the universities minister"". And she added: ""To accept this kind of pay rise, while saying he must axe 75 academic jobs because money is tight, beggars belief."" A statement from the university said the 1.1% pay rise was the only increase in Sir Christopher's remuneration since his appointment, and that he had declined a similar increment for 2017-18. ""The lower salary figure published for 2015-16 reflected only 10 months of his first year spent in office,"" it said. ""The vice-chancellor's salary was set and is regularly reviewed and agreed by the university's independently-chaired remuneration committee, which reports to the University Council. ""The vice-chancellor is not a member of the remuneration committee and only attends by invitation to discuss other business."" The university also paid Â£9,000 into a pension scheme from which he had opted out. The university drew criticism from Universities Minister Jo Johnson in the summer. He said in a speech: ""There is one institution on the south coast that has seen vice-chancellor pay rise from Â£227,000 in 2009-10 to Â£350,000 to 2015-16, which is really quite a sharp increase."" It comes two days after theUK's highest paid vice-chancellor Dame Prof Glynis Breakwell stepped down. The University of Bath boss had become the focus of criticism for her Â£468,000 salary. Lecturers had complained that her pay had risen much more rapidly than the salaries of university staff. Dr Gill Rider, chair of the University Council, said: ""The University of Southampton is a world-renowned teaching and research institution with over 24,000 students, 6,500 members of staff and a turnover of Â£590 million per annum, less than a quarter of which comes from EU/home tuition fees. ""We recruited Sir Christopher to Southampton two years ago because we wanted an outstanding leader for the university. ""He is a hugely respected academic, knighted for his services to engineering and higher education. ""He is one of the most experienced vice-chancellors in the sector with a track record of delivering long-term exceptional results, and he is a former president of Universities UK. ""He has held international leadership roles in the private sector, including as a plc chief executive, and he has served on the prime minister's Council for Science and Technology. ""Sir Christopher brings breadth and depth of experience that is critical to Southampton's long-term success.""

"This video can not be played One victim said Sparey threatened to set fire to her house when she could not repay him A loan shark nicknamed Del Boy who charged astronomical interest to more than 100 victims has been jailed for three-and-a-half years. Robert Sparey, 55, from Caerphilly, who claimed disability benefits, handed out illegal loans of about Â£250,000. He admitted illegal money lending over 20 years, along with other offences. Cardiff Crown Court heard he successfully sued some victims in the civil court, claiming he had loaned ""friends"" money and was not repaid. In total, 116 individual borrowers were identified. Sparey also admitted selling counterfeit tobacco and attempting to pervert the course of justice. The court heard he made his collections in a motability car using a disabled family member as ""a front"". Tim Evans, prosecuting for the Wales Illegal Money Lending Unit, said many people who end up borrowing from illegal money lenders are vulnerable and at first consider the person a friend. He said Sparey portrayed himself as a victim of physical and financial circumstances - but seized records, which only covered the past three years, showed an estimated Â£264,405 in loans was to be repaid by his victims. The loans themselves totalled Â£183,991 - with Â£61,839 the interest. One loan was a repayment within two days of Â£475 on a loan of Â£350. Mr Evans said it was difficult to know exactly how much money Sparey had made due to limited records, but about Â£20,000 in cash was found in his home, hidden in chocolate tins, food jars and bedroom cupboards. He also had made large payments to credit card companies. The court heard some victims were taken to the civil court by Sparey over the money he was owed. ""Bailiffs came to take property from [one victim's] home but she was so penniless there was nothing to take,"" Mr Evans said. Sparey was found to have about Â£43,000 in assets - including an Â£18,000 caravan, two genuine Rolex watches worth Â£3,000, and gold jewellery and ingots valued at Â£1,750. ""He would open the fridge where he kept rolls and rolls of money. He used to joke that his fridge was his safe,"" Mr Evans said. The court heard in mitigation that Sparey took more than 30 medications each day, suffered from renal failure and was at risk of having a heart attack. Sentencing him, Judge Eleri Rees said: ""We've heard a catalogue of the misery you've caused. ""Not only were you preying on some of the most vulnerable in society often unable to obtain credit elsewhereâ¦ but in some cases this was accompanied by threats of violence. ""At the time you were claiming benefits you were making substantial amounts of cash."" After the case, head of the Wales Illegal Money Lending Unit, Stephen Grey said: ""This is a man who portrayed himself as a victim of physical and financial circumstances. ""(He) hasn't been employed since 1990, received full council tax benefit, housing benefit, Â£57 per week from the mobility scheme for his car, the highest level of employment support allowance possible and was in fact making substantial amounts of money being a loan shark.""

"Police in the German city of Potsdam are investigating a device filled with nails found next to a Christmas market. The device, that also held batteries and wires, was sent to a pharmacy in the city south-west of Berlin. Police initially said there were explosives inside, but then clarified there was no detonator. Germany is on a heightened terror alert, a year after 12 people died in an Islamist attack at a Berlin Christmas market. The device was found near Brandenburgerstrasse in the centre of Potsdam, which has a number of other Christmas markets. A police spokesman said an X-ray scan was conducted on the device, which found that it had nails inside. It was then made safe. The Interior Minister for Brandenburg, Karl-Heinz SchrÃ¶ter, said police were searching the area in case more devices were sent. ""We just don't know at this point if this was a device that could have actually exploded, or a fake, or a test,"" he said. More than 2,600 Christmas markets opened across Germany on Monday. They bring in an estimated Â£2bn (â¬2.3bn; $2.7bn) of business a year.

"Oxford University has raised a record amount of funding for a UK university bond issue Oxford University has revealed that it will raise Â£750m from its first bond issue - the biggest amount raised this way by a UK university. It is the most significant example so far of universities turning to the capital markets for investment rather than student fees. It will mean more funds will be raised from these loans than Oxford's research funding from last year. The university says it will use the money for improving facilities. The bond means the university will receive funds from investors, which will be repaid after 100 years, with an annual interest rate of 2.54%. The amount is higher than had been anticipated, after a starting point of selling bonds worth Â£250m. It is understood that the bond offer was heavily oversubscribed, with Â£2bn of funds offered by investors. It will be seen as a long-term, low-risk opportunity for investors, but also a further shift in university finances. With uncertainty about tuition fees and government funding, universities have increasingly begun to turn to raising money from private investors. Oxford says it will give them ""confidence and freedom"" to spend on major developments, with plans to invest Â£1.5bn in  building projects over the next 10 to 15 years. This will be substantially bigger than any other UK university bond issue so far, but Cambridge, Leeds, Manchester, Cardiff and Liverpool are among the institutions which have previously raised money this way. Individual Oxford colleges have also issued bonds, but this is the first time that the university itself has made such an offer to investors. It means borrowing to raise cash in the short-term and paying back in the long-term, with the funds often used for capital projects, such as new buildings, libraries or overhauling facilities. It is also likely to raise questions about richer universities using investment markets to create an even wider wealth gap with other institutions. The Moody's credit rating agency this week gave Oxford its highest Aaa rating - citing its ""extraordinary market position"". Moody's reported that this reflected the strong demand from students, significant research funding and an endowment worth Â£2.6bn. The credit rating agency said that Oxford's research income last year stood at Â£730m, a figure overshadowed by a single entry into the investment market. The university's vice-chancellor, Professor Louise Richardson, said the rating was ""gratifying testament to the belief of the outside world in the extraordinary institution that has been developed over the centuries"". ""It is our responsibility to ensure that we use the opportunities accorded us by this bond to pass on to our successors an even stronger university.""

"Natasha Gordon denied assisting in the death of Matthew Birkinshaw A woman has been found guilty of encouraging the suicide of a man she met online. Natasha Gordon, 44, had denied encouraging or assisting in the death of Matthew Birkinshaw. The 31-year-old postman, from Walsall, West Midlands, was found dead in his car at Rutland Water in December 2015. Gordon, of Paston in Peterborough, was found guilty at Leicester Crown Court. Sentencing has been adjourned to a later date. After the trial, Mr Birkinshaw's parents said it had been the ""longest, hardest, saddest and most traumatic two years of our lives"". Matthew Birkinshaw's parents paid tribute to their ""thoughtful, sensitive, generous and compassionate"" son The court heard the pair made contact on an internet forum where Mr Birkinshaw spoke of ending his life. Gordon had attempted to encourage six others to commit suicide and told the postman she was prepared to be his ""suicide partner"", prosecutor Tim Cray told the jury. In a message to Mr Birkinshaw, Gordon said: ""I really can't wait to go tomorrow, I hope you do not change your mind."" The court heard the pair travelled to Rutland Water together but Gordon left Mr Birkinshaw because she ""couldn't go through with it"". Gordon was found guilty at Leicester Crown Court Mr Cray said: ""This is a million miles from a mercy killing. All the evidence shows she thought and talked about suicide and was prepared to tell people she'd just met that it was the right thing to do."" The court was told Mr Birkinshaw was in good health, part of a loving family and had a girlfriend. His parents urged others ""who may be struggling with these feelings"" to seek out agencies that can help. ""If this message averts one tragedy, it will mean that something positive has come out of the death of such a beautiful and much-loved son,"" they said. Gordon told the court she had no input into Mr Birkinshaw's decision to kill himself and he had ""wanted to die"". She told the jury: ""Matthew offered for me to go with him, it wasn't the other way round."" The court heard Gordon had a history of depression and in January 2015 had attempted to kill herself.

"Police in the German city of Potsdam are investigating a device filled with nails found next to a Christmas market. The device, that also held batteries and wires, was sent to a pharmacy in the city south-west of Berlin. Police initially said there were explosives inside, but then clarified there was no detonator. Germany is on a heightened terror alert, a year after 12 people died in an Islamist attack at a Berlin Christmas market. The device was found near Brandenburgerstrasse in the centre of Potsdam, which has a number of other Christmas markets. A police spokesman said an X-ray scan was conducted on the device, which found that it had nails inside. It was then made safe. The Interior Minister for Brandenburg, Karl-Heinz SchrÃ¶ter, said police were searching the area in case more devices were sent. ""We just don't know at this point if this was a device that could have actually exploded, or a fake, or a test,"" he said. More than 2,600 Christmas markets opened across Germany on Monday. They bring in an estimated Â£2bn (â¬2.3bn; $2.7bn) of business a year. There is an increased police presence in city centres this year and car barriers have been put up around some Christmas markets. Germany's interior ministry said this week that the risk of an attack on its territory or in Europe was ""continuously high"". In last December's Berlin Christmas market attack, Anis Amri, a Tunisian asylum seeker, hijacked a lorry and killed its driver before ramming it into shoppers, killing another 11 people.

"An independent review says the cost of converting the Olympic Stadium was Â£323million London Mayor Sadiq Khan has agreed to take over the former Olympic Stadium amid ""financial challenges"".

"This video can not be played One victim said Sparey threatened to set fire to her house when she could not repay him A loan shark nicknamed Del Boy who charged astronomical interest to more than 100 victims has been jailed for three-and-a-half years. Robert Sparey, 55, from Caerphilly, who claimed disability benefits, handed out illegal loans of about Â£250,000. He admitted illegal money lending over 20 years, along with other offences. Cardiff Crown Court heard he successfully sued some victims in the civil court, claiming he had loaned ""friends"" money and was not repaid. In total, 116 individual borrowers were identified. Sparey also admitted selling counterfeit tobacco and attempting to pervert the course of justice. The court heard he made his collections in a motability car using a disabled family member as ""a front"". Tim Evans, prosecuting for the Wales Illegal Money Lending Unit, said many people who end up borrowing from illegal money lenders are vulnerable and at first consider the person a friend. He said Sparey portrayed himself as a victim of physical and financial circumstances - but seized records, which only covered the past three years, showed an estimated Â£264,405 in loans was to be repaid by his victims. The loans themselves totalled Â£183,991 - with Â£61,839 the interest. One loan was a repayment within two days of Â£475 on a loan of Â£350. Mr Evans said it was difficult to know exactly how much money Sparey had made due to limited records, but about Â£20,000 in cash was found in his home, hidden in chocolate tins, food jars and bedroom cupboards. He also had made large payments to credit card companies. The court heard some victims were taken to the civil court by Sparey over the money he was owed. ""Bailiffs came to take property from [one victim's] home but she was so penniless there was nothing to take,"" Mr Evans said. Sparey was found to have about Â£43,000 in assets - including an Â£18,000 caravan, two genuine Rolex watches worth Â£3,000, and gold jewellery and ingots valued at Â£1,750. ""He would open the fridge where he kept rolls and rolls of money. He used to joke that his fridge was his safe,"" Mr Evans said. The court heard in mitigation that Sparey took more than 30 medications each day, suffered from renal failure and was at risk of having a heart attack. Sentencing him, Judge Eleri Rees said: ""We've heard a catalogue of the misery you've caused. ""Not only were you preying on some of the most vulnerable in society often unable to obtain credit elsewhereâ¦ but in some cases this was accompanied by threats of violence. ""At the time you were claiming benefits you were making substantial amounts of cash."" After the case, head of the Wales Illegal Money Lending Unit, Stephen Grey said: ""This is a man who portrayed himself as a victim of physical and financial circumstances. ""(He) hasn't been employed since 1990, received full council tax benefit, housing benefit, Â£57 per week from the mobility scheme for his car, the highest level of employment support allowance possible and was in fact making substantial amounts of money being a loan shark.""

"Oxford University has raised a record amount of funding for a UK university bond issue Oxford University has revealed that it will raise Â£750m from its first bond issue - the biggest amount raised this way by a UK university. It is the most significant example so far of universities turning to the capital markets for investment rather than student fees. It will mean more funds will be raised from these loans than Oxford's research funding from last year. The university says it will use the money for improving facilities. The bond means the university will receive funds from investors, which will be repaid after 100 years, with an annual interest rate of 2.54%. The amount is higher than had been anticipated, after a starting point of selling bonds worth Â£250m. It is understood that the bond offer was heavily oversubscribed, with Â£2bn of funds offered by investors. It will be seen as a long-term, low-risk opportunity for investors, but also a further shift in university finances. With uncertainty about tuition fees and government funding, universities have increasingly begun to turn to raising money from private investors. Oxford says it will give them ""confidence and freedom"" to spend on major developments, with plans to invest Â£1.5bn in  building projects over the next 10 to 15 years. This will be substantially bigger than any other UK university bond issue so far, but Cambridge, Leeds, Manchester, Cardiff and Liverpool are among the institutions which have previously raised money this way. Individual Oxford colleges have also issued bonds, but this is the first time that the university itself has made such an offer to investors. It means borrowing to raise cash in the short-term and paying back in the long-term, with the funds often used for capital projects, such as new buildings, libraries or overhauling facilities. It is also likely to raise questions about richer universities using investment markets to create an even wider wealth gap with other institutions. The Moody's credit rating agency this week gave Oxford its highest Aaa rating - citing its ""extraordinary market position"". Moody's reported that this reflected the strong demand from students, significant research funding and an endowment worth Â£2.6bn. The credit rating agency said that Oxford's research income last year stood at Â£730m, a figure overshadowed by a single entry into the investment market. The university's vice-chancellor, Professor Louise Richardson, said the rating was ""gratifying testament to the belief of the outside world in the extraordinary institution that has been developed over the centuries"". ""It is our responsibility to ensure that we use the opportunities accorded us by this bond to pass on to our successors an even stronger university.""

"Barry Links station is located between Dundee and Carnoustie A railway station in Angus is the least used in Great Britain, new figures have revealed. Just 24 passengers travelled to or from Barry Links station in 2016/17, according to data published by the Office of Rail and Road (ORR) Only two ScotRail trains stop at the station, which is unstaffed and has no facilities, each day between Monday and Saturday. The station, which opened in 1851, is located between Dundee and Carnoustie. Brian Boyd, an independent councillor on Angus Council, said the station was used more than the figures suggested. He said: ""Many people buy Carnoustie tickets but get off at Barry. ""These figures are quoted based on who buys tickets for stations and you can't buy a ticket at Barry so you buy it at Carnoustie. ""I can assure you there's at least a dozen passengers coming off each and every evening from the tea-time train at Barry. ""Yes, there aren't many trains that stop there but the figures are way out, in my opinion."" Mr Boyd, who represents the Carnoustie and District Ward, expects the station to be well-used next summer as golf fans travel to the Open Championship. He said: ""With golf coming in 2018, it will used considerably more because it's right on the perimeter of the world-renowned golf course. ""It's an important station for the area."" Last year's least-used station, Shippea Hill in Cambridgeshire,saw its passenger figures rise from 12 to 156 over the last 12 months. The numbers of people using at Shippea Hill have risen dramatically It received a publicity boost when Great British Bake Off finalist Ian Cumming offered mince pies to people who disembarked at the station on Christmas Eve 2016. The data suggested that Glasgow Central and Edinburgh Waverley are Scotland's busiest railway stations, with 32,060,134 and 22,582,342 entries and exits respectively. London Waterloo maintained its title as Britain's busiest station for the 14th consecutive year. Some 99.4 million passengers used the station in the past year, up by more than 250,000 on 2015/16. The ORR survey,externalcovers 2,560 UK mainland railway stations. Five other stations - Tees-side Airport, Breich, Kildonan, British Steel Redcar, and Reddish South had fewer than 100 entries and exits.

Mr Jones claimed that despite the Labour leader's ""rock star persona"" he was ""underwhelming"" in person.

Mr Corbyn's former spokesman Matt Zarb-Cousin said Mr Jones had not been in the room for the interview and said the editor's politics were ""well known"". ""It's slightly puzzling that the editor of GQ would put Jeremy Corbyn on the cover of his magazine looking like a prime minister in waiting, only to go on the Today programme and say the complete opposite,"" he said.

In the interview with BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Jones said: ""The actual shoot itself was quite tortuous. It was as difficult as shooting any Hollywood celebrity. ""We've shot many politicians for our cover ... but never have we encountered such a ring. Obviously [Labour director of communications] Seumas Milne and his crew are very particular gate-keepers. ""They didn't really seem to understand the process at all, didn't understand (a) that he would have to be photographed in the first place (b) that he would need to be presentable or that he couldn't just turn up in his anorak.

Last year he hada memorable clash on BBC Question Timewith shadow chancellor John McDonnell over the future of the party. Asked whether he had fallen out with Mr Corbyn's team, Mr Jones said: ""We haven't fallen out with anyone, we are just describing the process of what we went through to get the cover, which I found very intriguing.""

"Cracking open some fancy biscuits is a welcome treat over Christmas, but this year the observant shopper might notice a hefty rise in prices. Research by The Grocer based on data from Brandview has found price rises of up to a third on own-label Christmas biscuits sold by supermarkets. It said five supermarkets had increased prices with shortbread and gingerbread the main victims. The report says that a steep rise in butter prices is partly to blame. Biscuits featured in the report include: Asda's Christmas milk, dark and white chocolate biscuits up 33% to Â£4 Sainsbury's Scottish Shortbread Selection (600g) up 20% to Â£6 Tesco Novelty Shortbread Tin (250g) up 20% to Â£5 Morrisons Gingerbread Man up 23% to 80p A Sainsbury's spokesperson said: ""The cost of individual products is determined by a number of factors and prices can fluctuate, both up and down, as a consequence. We remain committed to providing our customers with great quality and value every time they shop with us."" Waitrose disputed the report's finding that its Christmas Choc Shortcake Selection (585g) had risen from Â£4 to Â£5. It said The Grocer had taken a discounted price in 2016 and the price was actually unchanged from last year. There has been a trend this year of rising food prices, driven by the weakness of the pound which makes imported food more expensive. The latest inflation figures showed that in October the price of food and non-alcoholic drinks rose at an annual rate of 4.1%, the highest since September 2013. Butter has seen even steeper rises, which experts says reflects falling milk production. Data from European Commission showed that for the year to the end of October, butter prices had risen by 47% compared to last year. In recent weeks the price has fallen a bit, which has been welcomed by the Food and Drink Federation (FDF). A spokesperson for the FDF said: ""We will continue to monitor dairy market developments closely because extremes of price volatility are not helpful for UK food manufacturers or for the wider supply chain.""

"Bob Spink told the court he had collected more than 1,000 signatures in his career A former Tory MP and UKIP politician has been found guilty of election fraud. Bob Spink, 69, former MP for Castle Point, Essex, committed the offences during the Castle Point borough council elections in May last year. A jury at Southwark Crown Court found him guilty of four counts of permitting a false signature to be included on a nomination form for a UKIP councillor. UKIP agent James Parkin, 38, of Canvey Island, was also convicted. He was found guilty on two counts of the same charge. UKIP agent James Parkin was also convicted Judge Ian Graham said: ""These types of offences are taken very seriously."" Jurors heard Spink tricked ""elderly and infirm"" voters into signing the forms in April 2016, without making it clear what the documents were or which party he represented. The court heard people in Spink's constituency signed forms believing they were petitions, and having no idea they were supporting the UKIP candidate in the Castle Point council elections. Spink claimed everything was above board; that residents knew what they were signing; and that he only introduced the topic of the local elections once he had gained their support for his campaign to become a police and crime commissioner (PCC). Mr Spink told the court he had been involved in politics for 30 years The pair were found guilty by majority verdicts. They will be sentenced in the new year. Both men were released on bail. Mr Spink, from Benfleet, Essex, was Conservative MP for Castle Point from 1992 to 1997, and again from 2001. In 2008, he defected from the Conservative Party and joined UKIP, effectively becoming its first MP.

"It's the story that has dominated Donald Trump's presidency. But it's complicated. Let's take a step back. US intelligence agencies believe Russia tried to sway the election in favour of Mr Trump. A special counsel looked into whether anyone from his campaign colluded in the effort. After two years, we have a 448-page report in which the special counsel finds no evidence the campaign conspired with Russia. No, Robert Mueller also looked at 10 instances where the president obstructed justice. But he was unable to decide whether they amounted to a crime. His report also found that the Russian government did interfere in the election. Not really. We found out he tried to fire Mr Mueller. He had called it a witch hunt from the start. No. It was conducted by the hugely respected Mr Mueller, a Republican who used to run the FBI. There were several meetings between senior members of Mr Trump's team with Russian officials. Several meetings were not initially disclosed. Ex-National Security Adviser Michael Flynn lied to the FBI about meeting the Russian ambassador to the US before Mr Trump took office. The president's son, Donald Jr, met a Russian lawyer who said she had ""dirt"" on Hillary Clinton during the campaign. He brought charges against several of Mr Trump's inner circle. Ex-adviser Roger Stone has been charged with lying to Congress about his contacts with Wikileaks, which released emails belonging to Democratic officials that had allegedly been hacked by Russians. Mr Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen admitted lying to Congress, campaign finance violations and tax evasion and received a 36-month prison sentence. And former campaign chairman Paul Manafort lied to the FBI about his work in Ukraine, according to special counsel Robert Mueller, with whom he had been co-operating. Manafort has been jailed for bank fraud. Since he fired the man leading one of the investigations, ex-FBI Director James Comey, there were questions about whether he obstructed justice.

"RBS is closing 259 branches - one in four of its outlets - and cutting 680 jobs as more customers bank online. The closures involve 62 Royal Bank of Scotland and 197 NatWest branches. RBS, which is 71%-owned by the taxpayer, said it would try to ensure compulsory redundancies were ""kept to an absolute minimum"". The bank said use of its branches by customers had fallen 40% since 2014, but the Unite union, which represents bank staff, called the cuts ""savage"". Following the closures, the RBS group will be left with 744 branches. See the full list of branch closures here RBS's branch closure announcement is the third such this week, following Lloyds, which on Wednesday said it would close 49 branches, and Yorkshire Building Society, which said it would close 13 branches. An RBS spokesperson said: ""More and more of our customers are choosing to do their everyday banking online or on mobile. ""Since 2014 the number of customers using our branches across the UK has fallen by 40% and mobile transactions have increased by 73% over the same period. Over 5 million customers now use our mobile banking app and one in five only bank with us digitally. ""We realise this is difficult news for our colleagues and we are doing everything we can to support those affected."" Who do you trust after cash? Can a bank in a box replace a branch? RBS to close a quarter of branches in Scotland RBS brings curtain down on 'toxic' bank Unite said serious questions needed to be asked about whether the closures marked the end of branch network banking. Rob MacGregor, Unite national officer, said: ""This announcement will forever change the face of banking in this country resulting in over a thousand staff losing their jobs and hundreds of High Streets without any banking facilities. ""The closure of another 259 branches is savage. Why is the government signing off this alarming branch closure programme?"" RBS, like many of its competitors, says that branch use has dropped dramatically as people bank on the go. Industry analysts CACI forecasts that typical consumers will only visit a bank branch four times a year by 2022, as virtually all transactions or paperwork can be done online, or by letter or at a post office. Yet visiting a branch remains a way of life for many people - older people and small businesses particularly. A report into branch closures by Professor Russel Griggs likened losing a local branch to a ""bereavement"" for some people. So what is being done for them? The major banks have signed up to a protocol that ensures specially trained staff are in place to help customers find alternatives when a local branch is closing, such as using the Post Office. They must work more proactively to support elderly and vulnerable customers, and tell communities as quickly as possible after the decision has been made. Paul Wheelhouse, Scottish Government Minister for Business, Innovation and Energy, said: ""The news of further branch closures from RBS will be hugely concerning to many people in Scotland as it now not only affects, potentially, staff at RBS but also leaves large areas of Scotland, particularly rural areas, with limited branch coverage. ""While recognising that footfall in branches is falling, due to online banking, RBS, and other banks, must take into account the needs of all customers - not just those who can access and use digital services."" The news comes as RBS continues its rehabilitation from its state-backed bailout in 2008, prompted by the financial crisis. On Thursday, it said it had closed its so-called ""bad bank"", which was set up to handle toxic assets stemming from the crisis. Earlier this week, RBS passed the Bank of England stress tests, having failed in 2016. In last week's Budget, the government revived plans to sell down its stake in the bank, aiming to sell Â£15bn of its shares by 2023.

"This video can not be played Pope uses the ""R"" word Pope Francis has met a group of Muslim Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh and referred to them by name for the first time on his Asian visit. The Pope told a group of 16 refugees at an interfaith meeting in the capital Dhaka: ""The presence of God today is also called Rohingya."" He refrained from using the term on his earlier visit to Myanmar, which does not regard Rohingya as an ethnic group. Some 620,000 Rohingya refugees have fled Myanmar since August. The Pope had been criticised by rights groups for not using the term in Myanmar, whose militaryhas been accused of ethnic cleansing by the United Nations. He had used the term before his visit. Myanmar's government rejects the term Rohingya, labelling the community ""Bengalis"". It says they migrated illegally from Bangladesh so should not be listed as one of the country's ethnic groups. Why the worry over one word? All you need to know about Rohingya crisis Pope Francis in profile Yogita Limaye, BBC News, Dhaka It was a poignant moment when Pope Francis met Rohingya refugees in Dhaka.  One by one they went up on stage and met him. He held their hands and they each had a chance to say a few words to him. He placed his hand on the head of a little girl who was part of the group. Then in a short speech that was not part of the original programme Pope Francis used the contentious word ""Rohingya"" for the first time sending out his strongest message so far about the crisis during his visit to Myanmar and Bangladesh. But does it really make a difference especially since he didn't use the word or speak directly about the issue in Myanmar, the country that matters?  Mark Pierce from Save the Children told me his organisation would certainly have preferred the Pope to be more vocal about the crisis in Myanmar but says it is significant that he has spoken about it here in Bangladesh because it helps keep the spotlight on the plight of the refugees. About 3,000 refugees are estimated to have crossed over from Myanmar to Cox's Bazaar in Bangladesh in the past week alone adding to the hundreds of thousands who are already there living in camps. While there is an agreement between the governments of Bangladesh and Myanmar for the refugees to return, there are still no details of when or how this will happen. Pope Francis' comment to refugees in Dhaka was made in an improvised remark and was not in his speech to the interfaith meeting. ""In the name of all of those who have persecuted you, hurt you, I ask forgiveness,"" Pope Francis told the refugees. ""I appeal to your large hearts to give us the forgiveness that we are asking."" Rights groups had urged the Pope to use the term Rohingya to back the community. However, he had been warned by Catholic representatives in Myanmar not to use the term for fear of alienating the Buddhist majority. This video can not be played Rohingya girls say they were forced into sex work in Bangladesh The number of Catholics in Bangladesh is very small. The 350,000-strong community makes up 0.2% of the population. How Pope avoided angry reaction in Myanmar Myanmar's persecuted minority in pictures Earlier, the Pope ordained 16 priests at an outdoor Mass in Dhaka's Suhrawardy Udyan park. On the penultimate day of his Asia trip, he told the crowd: ""I know that many of you came from afar, for a trip for more than two days. Thank you for your generosity. This indicates the love you have for the Church.""

"Hundreds of new drivers have been given automatic bans for using their mobile phones at the wheel, under tougher laws introduced this year. In March, the punishment for driving while on the phone was doubled to six penalty points - enough to ban those with less than two years experience. Figures obtained by Radio 5 live reveal 290 new UK drivers were disqualified in the first six months since the change. RAC road safety spokesman Pete Williams said the figures were sad to see. The new rules about phone use apply in England, Scotland and Wales. Drivers who get six points within two years of passing their test automatically lose their licence. To get back behind the wheel, they have to retake both the theory and practical parts of the driving test. The RAC's Mr Williams said: ""These people have spent hours and hours and hundreds of pounds learning to drive to gain their personal freedom only to throw it all away through this foolish behaviour. ""The only consolation is that they now won't be involved in some horrific crash caused by the distraction of a handheld mobile phone,"" he added. When the new penalties were introduced, Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said they would ""act as a strong deterrent"" to mobile phone users. However, the figures, released by the DVLA under the Freedom of Information Act suggest a total of 15,752 drivers received six penalty points for using a mobile phone between March and August. This is an increase from 15,237 drivers in the same period in 2016. Ben Carvin was 13 when his mother was killed when a lorry driver crashed into her car, while using a mobile phone, Ben said he was forced to grow up 10 years overnight. ""I went from being pretty carefree to feeling I had to be a secondary parent to my sister."" After hearing Ben speak on 5 Live Daily, Jerry, a lorry driver from north London admitted using his phone ""pretty regularly"" and said he would now stop. ""I was always looking at my phone, if I get a call from my boss I will answer that call."" ""I lost my own mother when I was 13."" He said after listening to Ben, he would now use his ""do not disturb"" app. National Police Chiefs' Council lead for roads policing, Chief Constable Anthony Bangham, said the police took the offence seriously. ""This is not a minor offence and is never a risk worth taking because a moment's distraction behind the wheel can change lives forever. ""Our message is simple - don't do it,"" he added.

"It was more gripping than any box set we could get our hands on. Over two years, the investigations into Russian interference in the US election, and whether the Trump campaign colluded with the Kremlin, delivered daily developments and drama worthy of anything seen in House of Cards. In the end, 35 people and three companies were charged by Robert Mueller, the special counsel who investigated Russian interference in the 2016 election. Here's our guide to the main characters in the four seasons of the only political drama that mattered. This was the season in which Donald Trump, the reality TV star, took centre stage in his own political drama by launching a presidential campaign. He was supported by his family and got the attention of the Russians. The season ended with a cliffhanger - could Trump the outsider actually win?! It's been a while since all of this happened, so let's remind you of the key players in this season. Who was he?Donald Trump, the billionaire candidate (who by Season Three is the 45th president of the United States). If you really need a refresher,here's his life story. Key plot lineAs Donald Trump was busy traversing the country canvassing for votes in Season One, Russia hacked into the emails of his Democratic rivals, investigators later said. The question is why? Was the Kremlin trying to alter the outcome of the election, and what did Trump and his campaign know? Skip forward to the end of Season Four and Mr Trump stood triumphant before reporters in a Florida airport, celebrating what he called ""a complete and total exoneration"". But in between, there was no shortage of drama or tension. Who was he?He was Trump's campaign chairman before being forced to quit over his ties to Russian oligarchs and Ukraine. Key plot lineHe was one of the biggest dominoes to fall. When he ended up being arrested, it was a big season-ending shocker. Manafort hung around a bit in Season One, but then disappeared from view for a while. He quit the campaign after being accused of having links to pro-Russian groups in Ukraine. He also sat in on a crucial meeting with a Russian lawyer who may have been trying to feed the Trump team classified information (more on that later). After an FBI raid on his home in Season Three, Manafort was found guilty on eight charges of tax fraud, bank fraud, and failing to disclose foreign banks accounts and is sentenced to 47 months in prison. In Season Four, he agreed to co-operate with a special counsel inquiry in exchange for a reduced prison term. But then, in a twist - prosecutors claimed he breached his plea bargain by repeatedly lying to the FBI. Read more:The man who helped Trump win Who was he?The president's eldest child, who it emerged met some questionable Russians. Key plot lineDonald Trump Jr's role in this unfolding saga all came down to a meeting he had with a Russian lawyer, which was set up by a music publicist (the full details of which come out in Season Three). If it sounds random, then in many ways it is. The publicist, Rob Goldstone, offered Trump Jr a meeting with lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, promising him dirt on Hillary Clinton. This meeting was the key to much of our plot line because it raised several key questions. Did this amount to the campaign colluding with a foreign government? Why did he agree to the meeting? What happened at the meeting was the scene investigators played over and over again as they tried to work out if there was any impropriety. In the end, no collusion charges were brought. Read more:Trump Jr's habit for making headlines DonaldTrumpconfounded his critics by winningthe presidency.But the transition was as gripping as the season before it as Trump picked his cabinet, introducing key characters to the mix. The season ended with Trump taking the oath of office on a cold January morning - but there were more twists to come. Who was he?The granite-faced former general who later became the shortest-serving member of Donald Trump's cabinet. He resigned after not being honest about his contact with a Russian official - and was later charged with making false statements to the FBI. Key plot lineFlynn was appointed national security adviser just days after the election, against the advice of then-President Obama, who warned Trump not to hire him. Flynn's starring role came in December 2016, just before Trump was sworn in, when he spoke to the Russian ambassador, Sergei Kislyak. The Washington Post and New York Times said the men discussed Russian sanctions, and that Flynn later lied to the Vice President Mike Pence about the conversation (Mr Kislyak says the men discussed only ""simple things""). The substance of those talks eventually led to Flynn being prosecuted as part of the investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller. At the end of Season Three, in December 2017,Flynn pleaded guiltyto making ""false, fictitious and fraudulent statements"" to the FBI about what he and Kislyak discussed. With that, the investigation reached Trump's inner circle. Read more:Out after 23 days - who is Michael Flynn? Who was he?Many roads in this drama led back to Sergei Kislyak, the jolly and charismatic figure, who up until July 2017 wasthe Russian ambassador to Washington. Key plot lineKislyak's role in this drama remained unclear up to the end - but many of the players in this drama had meetings with him, and that put them in awkward spots. The key questions for investigators were: why were they drawn to him, and what was said? The Russian ambassador spoke to both Flynn and Attorney-General Jeff Sessions - meetings which both Trump officials didn't initially acknowledge took place. Anything else we should know? Well, Russia fiercely fought back against claims on CNN that Kislyak was a ""top spy and recruiter of spies"". Who was he?Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III hovered in the background during Season One, when he was an Alabama senator and a trusted Trump adviser, but we really got to know him during Season Two, when he became Trump's nominee for attorney general, a job he kept for almost two years. Key plot lineSessions was one of several Trump aides to meet Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak, and question marks emerged over the nature of those meetings. When the FBI investigation focused on the Trump campaign, Sessions stood down from the inquiry, much to Trump's irritation. That decision to step down dogged him to the end, and he was written out of the series close to the end of Season Four, when Trump forced him to resign. That move put control of the Mueller investigation into the hands of a Trump loyalist. Read more:An attorney general dogged by scandal This was where the drama really picked up and all the plot lines came together. A lot of the background characters we saw in Season One came back with a vengeance and the infighting got nasty - and this is when the police started circling. Who was she?A Russian lawyer with a fearsome reputation who fought against US restrictions on Russia. But was she a Kremlin stooge? Despite earlier denials, she admitted in April 2018 to being an ""informant"" for Russia's prosecutor general. Key plot lineHers was a small but crucial role - she's the one who Manafort, Trump Jr and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner met in June 2016, the details of which begin trickling out a year later in a flashback sequence. She said the meeting was to discuss adoptions - but those who helped set it up said she was offering dirt on the Democrats and Hillary Clinton's campaign. While the meeting became a central plot point, whatever happened inside never actually led to any charges. That meeting would never have happened without... Who were they?Emin Agalarov is Azerbaijan's biggest pop star, of course. Have you not heard Love is a Deadly Game? Emin helped bring Donald Trump's Miss Universe competition to Russia and the two are close enough tosend each other birthday messages,external. His dad, Aras, is a billionaire who mixes in the highest circles of influence in Moscow. Key plot lineAgain in a flashback scene, we met Emin as he set the wheels in motion on that Trump Jr meeting. An email sent to Trump Jr suggested Emin was offering information on the Democrats (Emin said he wasn't). The email also said Aras Agalarov had apparently met the ""crown prosecutor"" of Russia - a role that weirdly didn't exist - and got information on Hillary Clinton. Are you keeping up? Read more:The tough-talking networker Who was he?He became deputy attorney general under Jeff Sessions. In the TV drama of the Russia scandal, this is the sort of role that would go to a solid Broadway actor you recognise but can't put a name to. Key plot lineWhen Sessions stood down from leading the main investigation into the Trump-Russia ties, it fell to Rosenstein to do that job. In a major plot development, he appointed a special investigator - not a popular move with the White House. Read more:Who is Rod Rosenstein? Who was he?Married to Trump's daughter, Ivanka, Kushner was the character who was seen but very rarely heard. Key plot lineAmid cries of nepotism, he was given a plum White House job as senior adviser to the president with a wide-ranging portfolio. It was his contacts with the Russians during the election campaign and beyond that led investigators to circle him. In June 2016, Kushner attended THAT meeting with Donald Trump Jr and the Russian lawyer. He said he was so bored he messaged his assistant to call him so he could leave. Kushner was also another character who had repeated contact with Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak - contact that he initially failed to disclose. Read more:The son-in-law with Trump's ear Who was he?A British former tabloid journalist, with a penchant for selfies in silly hats, was perhaps an unlikely addition to the cast, but in most good dramas there's always room for the slightly out-of-place eccentric. Key plot lineRob Goldstone found his way into Donald Trump's circle of trust thanks to his connections with Russian pop star Emin Agalarov. Goldstone managed the pop star, and it was he who contacted Donald Trump Jr on behalf of his client to set up that now-infamous meeting at Trump Tower in June 2016. Goldstone sent an email to Trump Jr promising dirt on Hillary Clinton. Read more:The Music Man with a love for hats Who was he?At 6ft 8in, James Comey was a towering figure, the character who gave little away about himself personally but had a huge role in this story. Key plot lineHe first entered this drama in Season One, when as head of the FBI he reopened the investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails - just weeks before the election. Democrats blamed him for her loss, Republicans hailed him a hero. That, we thought, was the last we'd seen of him. Jump ahead to Season Three, when months into the Trump presidency, Comey was fired by the new president. In true television drama style, he learned of his sacking as he was watching TV news during a trip to LA. Up to then, Comey was heading up an investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. Even by the end of the series, whether this amounted to obstruction of justice by the president remained an unresolved plot point. Comey's testimony to the Senate was one of the most set-pieces in the series up to this point, as  - under oath - he told politicians he was asked to pledge loyalty to the president, but refused. Read more:The FBI director who took centre stage Who was he?A former election adviser to Trump, although you'd be forgiven if you didn't remember the face. He was in only a few scenes in Season Two, but he had a massive role to play in Season Three, becoming the first person to plead guilty as part of the investigation. Key plot lineIn late October 2017, court documents emerged showing Papadopoulos had pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about the timing of meetings with alleged go-betweens for Russia. After lying to the FBI, he deleted an incriminating Facebook account and destroyed a phone. His guilty plea and co-operation with the investigation had the potential to damage the US leader because it related directly to his campaign - but in the end, it didn't do so. Read more:Why Papadopoulos case matters Who was he?The man who held the fate of the Trump presidency in his hands. Key plot lineSome characters wielded a lot of power, but didn't have a starring role, such as Robert Mueller, the tall chiselled figure who was appointed as ""special counsel"" to take over the Russia investigation after the dismissal of James Comey. Mueller came from the same stock as Comey - both were former heads of the FBI. There were no showboating scenes and powerhouses speeches from Mueller in this series - we only ever saw him studiously working in his office. There were reports that the president considered firing Mueller at one point - but Mueller stayed in the background doing his job until the very end of the series. After Season Three ended with the first charges being laid down by Robert Mueller, things really sped up in Season Four.The president's fury with the special counsel investigation increased and he fired his Attorney-General. But the series ended with no charges laid against the president and a sense of victory in the White House. Might we see a spin-off series...? Who was he?OK, he wasn't Putin's chef by this point, but he once was. In Season Four, he was the man accused of spearheading Russia's attempts to interfere in the 2016 election. Key plot lineA little out of the blue, Mueller announced charges against Prigozhin and 12 other Russians, accusing them of tampering with the US election by (among other things) organising and promoting political rallies in the US. In one surreal flashback sequence, we even see the Russians trying to buy a cage large enough to hold an actress dressed as Hillary Clinton in a prison costume. Read more:Seven key takeaways from indictment Who was he?The man who once said he would take a bullet for Donald Trump - but who instead turned against him. Key plot lineCohen, as Trump's long-time personal lawyer, lingered around the edges of the plot for the first three seasons, but became the big player of the fourth. When Mueller's team began looking into Cohen's finances, they passed on their concerns to investigators in New York. Then the plot took an unexpected new turn: Cohen, a long-time Trump loyalist, flipped and began co-operating with investigators. Not only that, but he ended up giving them a lot of help in exchange for a lighter sentence. Cohen ended up admitting violating campaign finance laws, committing tax evasion and lying to Congress. The last shot of the entire series was a mournful Cohen being locked into his jail cell. Who was he?A long-time Washington political operative who acted as an informal adviser to the Trump campaign. He called himself an agent provocateur, and once defended his actions by saying: ""One man's dirty trick is another man's political, civic action."" Key plot lineStone was one of those memorable bit-part characters in Seasons One and Two - a colourful character known for his fiery tongue, sharp suits and the Richard Nixon tattoo spread across his back. Towards the end of Season One, he appeared to let the cat out of the bag, hinting on Twitter that there was damaging information coming out on Hillary Clinton. Soon after, that information (that we later learned was found by Russia) was made public. After a bit of a lull in the middle of Season Four, investigators indicted Stone on seven counts of witness tampering, obstruction and false statements, although he wasn't charged with co-ordinating with Russia. All the way through, he denied any wrongdoing. He, like the president, called the investigation a ""witch-hunt"" and once said the accusations of collusion with Russia were ""a steaming plate of bull"".

"This video can not be played Damian Green speaking to reporters outside his home in his constituency of Ashford A former Scotland Yard detective has told BBC News he was ""shocked"" by the amount of pornography viewed on a computer seized from the Commons office of senior Tory MP Damian Green. Neil Lewis examined the device during a 2008 inquiry into government leaks and has not spoken publicly before. He said ""thousands"" of thumbnail images of legal pornography were on it. Mr Green, Theresa May's deputy, has said he never watched or downloaded pornography on the computer. Fellow Tory MP Andrew Mitchell defended Mr Green on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, saying: ""It is the misuse of entirely legal information to blacken the name of a serving cabinet minister."" But Mr Lewis said a check of the computer's internet history over a three-month period showed pornography had been viewed ""extensively"". This video can not be played ""I was shocked"": Former detective constable Neil Lewis speaks to the BBC On Tuesday, Scotland Yard confirmed its department for professional standards was examining allegations that Mr Lewis had disclosed confidential information. A statement from the Metropolitan Police said: ""Confidential information gathered during a police inquiry should not be made public."" On some days, websites containing pornography were being searched for and opened for several hours. Mr Lewis, who retired from the Metropolitan Police in 2014, said although ""you can't put fingers on a keyboard"", a number of factors meant that he was sure it was Mr Green, the MP for Ashford, Kent, who was accessing the pornographic material. His analysis of the way the computer had been used left the former detective constable in ""no doubt whatsoever"" that it was Mr Green, who was then an opposition immigration spokesman but is now the first secretary of state. ""The computer was in Mr Green's office, on his desk, logged in, his account, his name,"" said Mr Lewis, who at the time was working as a computer forensics examiner for SO15, the counter-terrorism command. ""In between browsing pornography, he was sending emails from his account, his personal account, reading documents... it was ridiculous to suggest anybody else could have done it."" Similar material had also been accessed on Mr Green's laptop, he claimed. Neil Lewis said he was ""shocked"" by the quantity of porn viewed on a computer used by Damian Green A Cabinet Office inquiry, set up last month to investigate allegations that the 61-year-old had made inappropriate advances to a political activist, Kate Maltby, is also examining the pornography claims. The inquiry is believed to centre on the ministerial code, which sets out the standards of conduct expected of government ministers. The code says they are expected to demonstrate ""the highest standards of propriety"" and contains reference to the Nolan Principles that holders of public office should be ""truthful"". A spokesperson for Mr Green said: ""It would be inappropriate for Mr Green to comment on these allegations while the Cabinet Office investigation is ongoing, however, from the outset he has been very clear that he never watched or downloaded pornography on the computers seized from his office. ""He maintains his innocence of these charges and awaits the outcome of the investigation."" Labour MP Hilary Benn told Today that the evidence from Mr Lewis should be considered. This video can not be played Andrew Mitchell defends Damian Green on Today over porn found on computer Despite being told about Mr Lewis's role examining Mr Green's computers, the Cabinet Office inquiry has not contacted him to give evidence. The Cabinet Office declined to give an explanation for that, but it's thought its inquiry may have approached the Metropolitan Police directly for details about the computers. The force has confirmed it is co-operating with the inquiry. Police evidence tag for the computer found in Damian Green's office During his time on SO15, Mr Lewis worked on some of Britain's most high-profile terrorism inquiries, including the 21/7 attack on London's transport network in 2005 - when he took a lead role examining digital devices. He also worked on Operation Miser, an investigation into Home Office leaks that began in October 2008 and resulted in Mr Green's Commons office being searched by police. Mr Lewis's job on the investigation was to search for material relating to documents that had been disclosed without authorisation from the Home Office, on computers used by Mr Green. In accordance with standard police practice, Mr Lewis carried out the examination on digital copies he had made of the computers' hard drives. When he ran a ""gallery view"" of images viewed on the desktop computer in Mr Green's Portcullis House office he noticed ""a lot of pornography thumbnails which indicated web browsing"", that he later confirmed by an examination of the computer's internet history. The pornography was not ""extreme"", as some reports have suggested, and did not contain images of children or abuse, said Mr Lewis, who previously served in the Met's obscene publications unit and carried out investigations into paedophiles. The matter was not referred to the Crown Prosecution Service for a charging decision. The former detective, who spent 25 years with the Met, said after the leaks inquiry ended he was ordered by the force to delete the data on the computer copies he had made. ""Morally and ethically I didn't think that was a correct way to continue,"" he said. The officer erased the data, as instructed, but kept the copies knowing experts could retrieve the information if they had to. However, he now believes the items may have been destroyed. A page from Neil Lewis's police notebook refers to pornography When he left the force after being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, Mr Lewis said the only police notebook he took with him was the one he had used during Operation Miser. The notebook, seen by the BBC, contains a reference to pornography. ""This one case, Operation Miser, I have never been comfortable with,"" he said, claiming the Parliamentary authorities should have been informed about the ""extensive"" time Mr Green allegedly spent looking at pornographic material. ""If a police officer does that, or anyone else, you'd be dismissed, you'd be thrown out."" The MPs' code of conduct states members should always behave with ""probity and integrity, including in their use of public resources"". The pornography allegations were first alluded to by Bob Quick, a former Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner, in written evidence to a Parliamentary committee in 2009. He said the discovery of ""private material"" on Mr Green's office computer had ""complicated"" the inquiry into Home Office leaks. This video can not be played Porn was allegedly viewed on Mr Green's office computer after police raids in 2008 In 2011, Mr Quick expanded on the matter in a draft statement for the Leveson Inquiry into press ethics, but it was removed from the final version, only to resurface last month in aSunday Times,externalarticle. Mr Green responded to Mr Quick's assertions by accusing him of spreading ""disreputable political smears"", an attack that so infuriated Mr Lewis that he approached the former counter-terrorism chief to offer his support. He even thought about contacting the cabinet minister directly. ""His outright denial of that was quite amazing, followed by his criticism of Bob Quick,"" said Mr Lewis. ""I think he [Mr Green] should have resigned a long time ago."" Sir Paul Stephenson, Met Commissioner during the leaks investigation, told the BBC he had been briefed about the pornography in 2008 but considered it to be a ""side issue"". The Office of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards has said it has no record of a referral being made.

"Former Met Commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson said the allegations against Mr Green showed ""no criminality"" A former Scotland Yard chief was aware pornography had allegedly been found on Damian Green's office computer during a 2008-9 police probe, he has said. Sir Paul Stephenson, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner between 2009-11, said he was briefed about the claims but regarded them as a ""side issue"". The allegations were first made public last week by former Met Assistant Commissioner, Bob Quick. First Secretary of State Mr Green said his accusers had ""ulterior motives"". This video can not be played Porn was allegedly found to have been viewed on Mr Green's office computer after police raids in 2008 Mr Green, who is Prime Minister Theresa May's second-in-command, said: ""I reiterate that no allegations about the presence of improper material on my parliamentary computers have ever been put to me or to the parliamentary authorities by the police. ""I can only assume that they are being made now, nine years later, for ulterior motives."" But Mr Quick, who led the investigation into Home Office leaks which saw Mr Green's Commons office being searched, says pornography was found on a computer there. Both Sir Paul and Mr Quick gave evidence to aCabinet Office inquiry into Mr Green's conductlast week, led by senior Cabinet Office official Sue Gray. The inquiry, which is being held behind closed doors, is also looking at a separate claim that Mr Green, made inappropriate advances towards a female Conservative activist in 2015. He also denies that allegation. Damian Green denies claims police found pornography on a computer in his office Speaking to the BBC, Sir Paul said he thought the claim about Mr Green ""wasn't relevant to the criminal inquiry"" into Home Office leaks, which began in October 2008. Mr Green's home and office were searched as part of that probe and he was briefly arrested in November that year, but the then shadow immigration minister faced no further action. A review of the police inquiry found that ""less intrusive methods"" could have been used. Referring to the pornography allegations, Sir Paul said: ""I regret it's in the public domain. ""There was no criminality involved, there were no victims, there was no vulnerability and it was not a matter of extraordinary public interest."" Sir Paul added that it was not Scotland Yard's role to ""police the workplace"". The Met declined to say whether it was helping the Cabinet Office investigate the claims, but said in a statement: ""As this is not our inquiry the MPS does not believe it is appropriate to comment upon it.""

"Damian Green said the allegations were from a ""tainted and untrustworthy source"" Theresa May's most senior minister has denied a claim that police found pornography on a computer in his office during a raid in 2008. First Secretary of State Damian Green said ex-police chief Bob Quick's claims inthe Sunday Times,externalwere ""completely untrue"" and ""political smears"". And he said police had never told him that any improper material had been found on a parliamentary computer. Mr Quick said he ""stood"" by the claim and would take part in an inquiry. Meanwhile, Conservative MP Chris Pincher has resigned as a government whip and referred himself to police following newspaper allegations about his conduct made by a party activist. The revelations are the latest in a growing sexual misconduct scandal in Westminster. Chris Pincher is the MP for Tamworth in Staffordshire On Sunday, further details emerged about allegations against Sir Michael Fallon, who this weekresigned as defence secretaryover his behaviour. Growing number of MPs under scrutiny Labour MSP 'groped' by senior colleague Crabb investigated over lewd text claim The Observer,externalreported that he quit shortly after journalist Jane Merrick told Downing Street he had lunged at her and attempted to kiss her on the lips in 2003 after they had lunch together. And Tory MPs Daniel Poulter, Stephen Crabb and Daniel Kawczynski have been referred to the Conservative Party disciplinary committee after media allegations about their conduct. The allegation regarding Mr Green, who is effectively the prime minister's deputy, relates to an inquiry into Home Office leaks which briefly led to his arrest in 2008. Daniel Poulter, Stephen Crabb and Daniel Kawczynski have faced questions about their professional conduct Former Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Bob Quick said on Sunday that his officers had found pornographic material on a computer in Mr Green's Commons office after they searched it as part of their controversial investigation - which resulted in no charges. The ex-anti-terror chief said he had made an appointment to speak to a senior official in the Cabinet Office, which last week launched an inquiry into an unrelated allegation against Mr Green, to discuss the matter. ""I bear no malice to Damian Green,"" he told BBC News. Mr Quick,who quit his role in 2009,externalafter inadvertently revealing secret documents, accepted he had not asked officers to report the matter at the time, saying they ""didn't expect to find the material"" and were in the midst of a ""very difficult inquiry with a lot of pressure to drop the case"". This video can not be played Andrew Marr asked Home Secretary Amber Rudd whether the centre of government was close to collapse But Mr Green said ""the allegations about the material and computer, now nine years old, are false, disreputable political smears"", adding that they ""amount to little more than an unscrupulous character assassination"". The Cabinet Office inquiry was triggered after journalist Kate Maltby, who is three decades younger than Mr Green, told the Times he ""fleetingly"" touched her knee during a meeting in a pub in 2015 and a year later sent her a ""suggestive"" text message after she was pictured wearing a corset in the newspaper. Mr Green said any allegation that he made sexual advances to Ms Maltby was ""untrue (and) deeply hurtful"". Two Tory MPs, Anna Soubry and Heidi Allen, have urged Mr Green to step aside pending the outcome of the investigation but Home Secretary Amber Rudd said her cabinet colleague had the right to defend himself. ""I do think that we shouldn't rush to allege anything until that inquiry has taken place,"" she told the BBC's Andrew Marr. More generally, she said abuse of power could not be tolerated and there needed to be a ""clearing out"" of Westminster to get rid of any such behaviour. What counts as inappropriate behaviour? Tories publish new code of conduct Welsh Assembly sexual harassment 'ignored' Meanwhile, Conservative MP Anna Soubry has said former Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon was ""responsible for his own downfall"" amid fresh claims about his past behaviour. Ms Merrick told the Observer she ""shrank away in horror"" when Sir Michael tried to kiss her when she was a 29-year-old reporter at the Daily Mail.

Was I even guilty that maybe I had led him on in some way by drinking with him?"" she said. ""After years of having a drink with so many other MPs who have not acted inappropriately towards me, I now know I was not."" Friends of Sir Michael have not denied the allegation, but the BBC understands that his ministerial career ended because he could not guarantee there would be no further revelations after he admitted repeatedly touching another journalist's knee at a conference dinner 15 years ago. Ms Soubry praised the journalist's ""outstanding bravery"" in coming forward and said she had put her in touch with Downing Street after Ms Merrick had confided in her and Labour's Harriet Harman. This video can not be played Jane Merrick ""outstandingly brave"" for speaking out about Sir Michael Fallon - Conservative MP Anna Soubry Theresa May, she added, must ensure an independent complaints system immediately so victims of harassment and those accused of misconduct did not have to undergo ""trial by newspapers"". Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said this must be a ""turning point"" for how the whole political class behaves, telling activists that his party - under fire for how it has handled harassment and rape allegations - was not afraid to ""shine a spotlight"" on itself. ""We must say, no more. We must no longer allow women, or anyone else for that matter, to be abused in the workplace or anywhere else,"" he said.

"This video can not be played Prince Harry and Meghan Markle during their 2017 visit to Nottingham Meghan Markle has had a taste of royal life, as she joined her fiance Prince Harry on their first joint official public engagement in Nottingham. Excited crowds cheered as the couple greeted well-wishers ahead of a visit to a World Aids Day charity fair hosted by the Terrence Higgins Trust. They split up to talk to people lining both sides of their route and were given cards, flowers and chocolate. After the charity fair, they met head teachers at a nearby school. Well-wishers gathered in the city ahead of the visit to catch a glimpse of the couple, including Helena Bottomley, Zoe Scott and Carole Bingham, from East and West Bridgford. Ms Scott said: ""We love the royals. We are genuinely happy for Harry."" ""We all had our children at the same time as Diana [Princess of Wales] so we feel a real allegiance. She would be so thrilled,"" said Ms Bottomley. The couple announced their engagement on Monday and are due to marry at Windsor Castle in May. Crowds share Harry and Meghan's 'fairytale' moment How Meghan made her mark as a 'real deal' campaigner One of the people Prince Harry stopped to speak to was Julie Ball, 51, of Netherfield, who said the prince had commented on her Santa gloves. ""He said 'great gloves' and pulled one down over my fingers,"" she said. ""I said they're from Primark for Â£3. ""When Meghan walked past she said the same thing. She said, 'We have the same taste.'"" Harry and Meghan to wed at Windsor in May WATCH: Full interview with Prince Harry and Meghan Markle How will Meghan Markle become a British citizen? Another member of the public shouted to Prince Harry: ""How does it feel being a ginger with Meghan?"" ""It's great isn't it?"" The prince replied. Dickie Arbiter, former royal spokesman, told the BBC the couple took their time to talk to as many people as possible on their 30-minute walkabout. This video can not be played A card designed especially for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle has been given to them The couple's engagement was announced on Monday University of Nottingham students Raushana Nurzhubalina, from Kazakhstan, and Jenn Galandy, from Canada, set their alarms for 06:00 GMT to get a prime spot to try to see Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. ""It is such an honour to see the royals,"" Ms Nurzhubalina said. ""I'm also a fan of Suits, so it is a chance to see a star of that too."" Allow Twitter content?

Royal fan Irene Hardman had a goody bag ready to hand over to the couple, including copies of the local paper and two fridge magnets ""so they don't fight over it"". Speaking afterwards, the 81-year-old said: ""I cried - she's wonderful, and it's fantastic. They're so genuine."" By BBC royal correspondent, Sarah Campbell They are due to marry at Windsor Castle in May By the time the royal couple arrived, the pavements in the Lace Market were packed. Prince Harry and Meghan spent around half an hour meeting the people of Nottingham who had come out in force despite the cold. Meghan appeared very relaxed and perfectly at ease. This was her first official royal engagement with Harry and if she was nervous at all it did not show. She smiled, she chatted, at one point she even picked up someone's glove and handed it back to them. This was a confident first public appearance. The couple split up at points to cover both parts of the pavement and meet the maximum number of people. Meghan was happy to shake hands with the crowd and as she wasn't wearing gloves, the ring was on show. Tactile with her fiancÃ©e and the crowd - it's fair to say the response from the people was overwhelmingly positive. After the walkabout, Prince Harry and Ms Markle went to the Nottingham Contemporary Exhibition Centre for an event to mark World Aids Day. Dominic Edwards, from the Terrence Higgins Trust, told the BBC the charity was ""thrilled"" the couple had chosen to visit Nottingham, and said: ""I think it really underlines his great support for HIV as a cause."" Royal commentator Richard FitzWilliams, said this visit represented a link with the legacy of Princess Diana's influential work on HIV 30 years ago and was ""no coincidence"". Allow Twitter content?

Prince Harry has spent time in Nottingham both publicly and privately since he first met young people there in 2013, when he was exploring issues around youth violence. A year later, he established the Full Effect programme, which aims to stop youth violence in the city. At Nottingham Academy, the couple will watch a ""hip hopera"" and meet students. The handbag Ms Markle chose to carry on her Nottingham visit has already sold out. The bag was made by the Scottish label, Strathberry, which said ""it was a fantastic surprise"" to see the bride-to-be carrying one of its designs. Ms Markle was wrapped up in a long navy coat by Mackage - a brand also favoured by actresses Gwyneth Paltrow, Halle Berry, Eva Mendes and Blake Lively. She wore the coat over a beige cotton, full midi skirt from British-based fashion label Joseph, priced at Â£595, which also sold out on the brand's website. Who is Meghan Markle? Profile: Prince Harry On Tuesday, the couple's spokesman said Ms Markle would not be continuing her work on gender with the United Nations or with other organisations and instead would start new charity work as a full-time royal. Mr Knauf said she planned to focus her attention on the UK and Commonwealth. ""This is the country that's going to be her home now and that means travelling around, getting to know the towns and cities and smaller communities,"" he said. She will also become the fourth patron of the Royal Foundation of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry. The foundation is behind Prince Harry's Invictus Games - the Paralympic-style competition for injured servicemen and women and veterans - and also the mental health charity Heads Together. It has also been announced that Ms Markle intends to become a British citizen and will work towards it in the coming years.

"This video can not be played Damian Green speaking to reporters outside his home in his constituency of Ashford David Davis has warned Downing Street not to sack Damian Green as a result of a ""wrongful attempt by former officers to do him down"", sources close to the Brexit Secretary have told the BBC. One said Mr Davis might be willing to resign over the issue, although another stressed no threat had been made. It comes after a retired detective said ""thousands"" of legal porn images had been found on Mr Green's computer. Mr Green says he never watched or downloaded pornography on the computer. 'Thousands' of porn images on MP's computer Mr Davis has thrown a ""protective cloak"" around the First Secretary of State, who is effectively Theresa May's second-in-command, a source told the BBC, after the storywas reported in the London Evening Standard,external. The Brexit Secretary feels he ""has a dog in the fight"" because Mr Green was his subordinate on the Conservative shadow home affairs team in 2008 when the material was allegedly discovered on Mr Green's computer, the BBC's deputy political editor John Pienaar said. According to one source, Mr Davis might be prepared to contemplate resignation, if he felt Mr Green had been ""mistreated"". This video can not be played ""I was shocked"": Former detective constable Neil Lewis speaks to the BBC Another close associate said no threat of resignation had been made but the Brexit's secretary's strong feeling had been conveyed to Downing Street ""at the highest level"". It was made clear that the warning from Mr Davis did not apply to the possibility of Mr Green losing his job under any circumstances, says John Pienaar. ""It's right that allegations of misconduct towards individuals are properly investigated,"" said an associate of Mr Davis. ""But police officers have a duty of confidentiality which should be upheld"". Retired Scotland Yard detective Neil Lewis told BBC News ""thousands"" of thumbnail images of legal pornography had been found on Mr Green's computer during a 2008 inquiry into government leaks. The BBC understands a Cabinet Office report into Mr Green's conduct - which ranges wider than allegations of viewing pornography on an office computer, and covers accusations of inappropriate conduct - could land on the prime minister's desk next week. The investigation has been carried out by senior Cabinet Office official Sue Gray. Speaking on the BBC's Newsnight programme, former Attorney General Dominic Grieve said the police officers were ""in flagrant breach of their own code of conduct"". ""If you think something's relevant, you do it by a proper official means, you do not go freelancing, as these two officers have done, and it has the smack of the police state about it,"" he said. ""I find it very worrying. They are not and must not be allowed to abuse those powers."" But former Gloucestershire Chief Constable Tim Brain defended the actions of the officers saying they had come forward with what they considered to be ""relevant information"" to an ongoing inquiry. ""Let's just think about this as a workplace computer and to think whether we are happy that people, our MPs, can have this kind of material on what is an official computer,"" he said. The allegations date back to November 2008 when the Conservatives were in opposition and Damian Green was their immigration spokesman He embarrassed the Labour government with a series of leaks about illegal immigration and other issues Police raided his Parliamentary office as part of an inquiry into how he got his hands on confidential documents His office computer was seized and he was detained for nine hours - sparking fury among Tory MPs No charges were brought against the MP or civil servant Christopher Galley, who passed unauthorised material to Mr Green, although the official was sacked The officer in charge of the inquiry, Bob Quick - widely criticised by Tory MPs for the raid - resigned six months later over an alleged security breach But a month ago, Mr Quick disclosed that pornographic material had been found on the seized computer, adding that the police had not pursued the matter at the time or told Mr Green about it The matter has since been investigated by the Cabinet Office as part on a wider inquiry into claims of inappropriate behaviour by Mr Green towards journalist Kate Maltby The chairman of the Commons culture committee said Mr Lewis should not give media interviews as the public was not getting the ""whole picture"". Tory MP Damian Collins told BBC Radio 4's Any Questions the ""Cabinet Office is running that investigation. They should receive and see any evidence that's pertinent to it... We should wait to see what the result of the official investigation is."" The DUP's leader at Westminster, Nigel Dodds, told Any Questions ""police are not above the law and it is totally wrong that an individual police officer should go out and make public statements like this"". Conservative MP Andrew Mitchell also defended Mr Green on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, saying: ""It is the misuse of entirely legal information to blacken the name of a serving cabinet minister."" But Mr Lewis said a check of the computer's internet history over a three-month period showed pornography had been viewed ""extensively"" and a number of factors meant that he was sure it was Mr Green, the MP for Ashford, Kent, who was accessing the material. This video can not be played Jacob Rees-Mogg tells Amol Rajan police ""behaved disgracefully"" by raiding Damian Green's office in 2008 Asked about the allegations in his constituency on Friday morning, Mr Green said: ""I have maintained all along - I still maintain, it is the truth, that I didn't download or look at pornography on my computer but obviously while the investigation is going on, I can't say any more than that."" On Tuesday, Scotland Yard confirmed its department for professional standards was examining allegations that Mr Lewis had disclosed confidential information. A statement from the Metropolitan Police said: ""Confidential information gathered during a police inquiry should not be made public."" The Cabinet Office investigation into Mr Green was prompted by allegations of inappropriate behaviour in 2015 and 2016 made by Conservative activist Kate Maltby, which the MP has described as ""completely false"". The inquiry is believed to centre on the ministerial code, which sets out the standards of conduct expected of government ministers.

"RBS is closing 259 branches - one in four of its outlets - and cutting 680 jobs as more customers bank online. The closures involve 62 Royal Bank of Scotland and 197 NatWest branches. RBS, which is 71%-owned by the taxpayer, said it would try to ensure compulsory redundancies were ""kept to an absolute minimum"". The bank said use of its branches by customers had fallen 40% since 2014, but the Unite union, which represents bank staff, called the cuts ""savage"". Following the closures, the RBS group will be left with 744 branches. See the full list of branch closures here RBS's branch closure announcement is the third such this week, following Lloyds, which on Wednesday said it would close 49 branches, and Yorkshire Building Society, which said it would close 13 branches. An RBS spokesperson said: ""More and more of our customers are choosing to do their everyday banking online or on mobile. ""Since 2014 the number of customers using our branches across the UK has fallen by 40% and mobile transactions have increased by 73% over the same period.

RBS to close a quarter of branches in Scotland RBS brings curtain down on 'toxic' bank Unite said serious questions needed to be asked about whether the closures marked the end of branch network banking. Rob MacGregor, Unite national officer, said: ""This announcement will forever change the face of banking in this country resulting in over a thousand staff losing their jobs and hundreds of High Streets without any banking facilities. ""The closure of another 259 branches is savage. Why is the government signing off this alarming branch closure programme?"" RBS, like many of its competitors, says that branch use has dropped dramatically as people bank on the go. Industry analysts CACI forecasts that typical consumers will only visit a bank branch four times a year by 2022, as virtually all transactions or paperwork can be done online, or by letter or at a post office. Yet visiting a branch remains a way of life for many people - older people and small businesses particularly. A report into branch closures by Professor Russel Griggs likened losing a local branch to a ""bereavement"" for some people. So what is being done for them? The major banks have signed up to a protocol that ensures specially trained staff are in place to help customers find alternatives when a local branch is closing, such as using the Post Office. They must work more proactively to support elderly and vulnerable customers, and tell communities as quickly as possible after the decision has been made. Paul Wheelhouse, Scottish Government Minister for Business, Innovation and Energy, said: ""The news of further branch closures from RBS will be hugely concerning to many people in Scotland as it now not only affects, potentially, staff at RBS but also leaves large areas of Scotland, particularly rural areas, with limited branch coverage. ""While recognising that footfall in branches is falling, due to online banking, RBS, and other banks, must take into account the needs of all customers - not just those who can access and use digital services."" The news comes as RBS continues its rehabilitation from its state-backed bailout in 2008, prompted by the financial crisis. On Thursday, it said it had closed its so-called ""bad bank"", which was set up to handle toxic assets stemming from the crisis. Earlier this week, RBS passed the Bank of England stress tests, having failed in 2016.

"This video can not be played Eve and Basil's Toy Story - as told by the BBC's The One Show A girl has been reunited with the cuddly toy she lost at an airport after images were shared around the world. Eve Mcilquham, 10, was distraught when she left Basil, a toy Labrador, at Glasgow Airport in July as the family travelled to visit her uncle in Canada. Now the pair have been reunited after his ""mugshot"" was shown online. Basil was one of 21 lost toys featured in avideo and picture gallery released by Glasgow Airportin September. This video can not be played Glasgow Airport launches appeal over lost soft toys The video, which features the toys on a luggage carousel, has been seen as far afield as Japan, Germany, Singapore, Jamaica, Australia and Russia. Eve's mother Lorraine Carlton recognised Basil in a video shared on Facebook ""About the fourth teddy in, I recognised that one straight away,"" she told the BBC's The One Show. Eve, from Hamilton, South Lanarkshire, recalled the mix-up that led to Basil being left behind in the departure lounge. ""I thought he was in my bag - or my mum had picked him up. So we went on the flight and he wasn't in my bag. ""I was crying my heart out on the plane. I just thought 'Oh no, I've not got Basil any more'. ""I didn't think I would get him back. I was so excited happy, overwhelmed. He means so much to me. He's the world to me."" In September, Glasgow Airport introduced  ""Take Care of my Bear"" tags to be given out to any child travelling from the airport with a soft toy, to make it easier to reunite them if they are separated. Basil has been issued with a Take Care of my Bear tag, to avoid future mishaps The tags are available at check-in and can be marked with the owner's details. A spokesman for Glasgow Airport said: ""I'm delighted that Eve and Basil have been reunited and that they can spend Christmas together. ""If you and your furry friend are travelling through the airport this festive season, don't forget to pick up your teddy tag at one of our check-in desks."" If a family has lost a cuddly toy or anything else at Glasgow Airport, they are advised to contact Luggage Point based in the main terminal.

The Very Reverend Kelvin Holdsworth wrote a blog post urging people to pray for him ""to be blessed one day with the love of a fine young gentleman"". His comments have been described as ""unkind"" and ""destructive"". Mr Holdsworth is provost of St Mary's Cathedral in Glasgow. He is from the Scottish Episcopal Church, whichvoted to allow gay couples to marryearlier this year. Same-sex marriages in Anglican churches are banned in England and Wales. In his blog post, Mr Holdsworth said that if Prince William's four-year-old son married another man in the future it would help the Church of England become more inclusive. ""A royal wedding might sort things out remarkably easily though we might have to wait 25 years for that to happen,"" he wrote. ""Who knows whether that might be sooner than things might work out by other means?"" Rev Holdsworth says Prince George being gay would help the Church to become more inclusive He told the BBC he first wrote the blog post more than a year ago but it gained traction after he tweeted it again following the news of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's engagement. ""This quote seems to be getting a lot of attention because it was picked up by a number of anti-gay campaigners in the Church of England,"" he said. ""It is a shame that the happy news about the royal wedding has been hijacked in this way."" Mr Holdsworth tweeted his blog post following Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's engagement Gavin Ashenden, a former chaplain to the Queen and a Christian Episcopal Church missionary bishop, said the comments were not Christian. ""To use prayer as a mechanism for wishing this on Prince George is an unkind and destructive thing to do,"" he told the BBC. ""It doesn't have the prince's best interests at heart, but uses him as a gender-political football to please 1.7% of the population. ""What is especially odd and incongruous is the fact that it is suddenly OK to pray for someone to be gay, but totally unacceptable to pray for them to be free from being gay and to resume a sexuality that was in tune with their biology. ""This seems not only contradictory but hypocritical."" Susie Leafe, the director of the conservative evangelical group Reform, was also critical of Mr Holdsworth's blog. ""I was very disappointed that he was prepared to bring a child in to this same-sex marriage debate,"" she told the BBC. ""As a Christian minister he should pray for all people to come to know the love of Christ, rather than a fine young gentleman."" The Church of England declined to comment on Mr Holdsworth's blog post as he is a member of the Scottish Episcopal Church. Rt Rev Dr Gregor Duncan, Bishop of Glasgow and Galloway, said:  ""The comments made by Provost Holdsworth were made on his personal blog. ""As his blog indicates, the views expressed there are his personal ones. ""They do not represent an official view of the Scottish Episcopal Church nor are they ones with which I would concur.  I will be discussing this matter with Provost Holdsworth."" What does Prince George want for Christmas?

"RBS is closing 259 branches - one in four of its outlets - and cutting 680 jobs as more customers bank online. The closures involve 62 Royal Bank of Scotland and 197 NatWest branches. RBS, which is 71%-owned by the taxpayer, said it would try to ensure compulsory redundancies were ""kept to an absolute minimum"". The bank said use of its branches by customers had fallen 40% since 2014, but the Unite union, which represents bank staff, called the cuts ""savage"". Following the closures, the RBS group will be left with 744 branches. See the full list of branch closures here RBS's branch closure announcement is the third such this week, following Lloyds, which on Wednesday said it would close 49 branches, and Yorkshire Building Society, which said it would close 13 branches. An RBS spokesperson said: ""More and more of our customers are choosing to do their everyday banking online or on mobile. ""Since 2014 the number of customers using our branches across the UK has fallen by 40% and mobile transactions have increased by 73% over the same period. Over 5 million customers now use our mobile banking app and one in five only bank with us digitally. ""We realise this is difficult news for our colleagues and we are doing everything we can to support those affected."" Who do you trust after cash? Can a bank in a box replace a branch? RBS to close a quarter of branches in Scotland RBS brings curtain down on 'toxic' bank Unite said serious questions needed to be asked about whether the closures marked the end of branch network banking. Rob MacGregor, Unite national officer, said: ""This announcement will forever change the face of banking in this country resulting in over a thousand staff losing their jobs and hundreds of High Streets without any banking facilities. ""The closure of another 259 branches is savage. Why is the government signing off this alarming branch closure programme?"" RBS, like many of its competitors, says that branch use has dropped dramatically as people bank on the go. Industry analysts CACI forecasts that typical consumers will only visit a bank branch four times a year by 2022, as virtually all transactions or paperwork can be done online, or by letter or at a post office. Yet visiting a branch remains a way of life for many people - older people and small businesses particularly. A report into branch closures by Professor Russel Griggs likened losing a local branch to a ""bereavement"" for some people. So what is being done for them? The major banks have signed up to a protocol that ensures specially trained staff are in place to help customers find alternatives when a local branch is closing, such as using the Post Office. They must work more proactively to support elderly and vulnerable customers, and tell communities as quickly as possible after the decision has been made. Paul Wheelhouse, Scottish Government Minister for Business, Innovation and Energy, said: ""The news of further branch closures from RBS will be hugely concerning to many people in Scotland as it now not only affects, potentially, staff at RBS but also leaves large areas of Scotland, particularly rural areas, with limited branch coverage. ""While recognising that footfall in branches is falling, due to online banking, RBS, and other banks, must take into account the needs of all customers - not just those who can access and use digital services."" The news comes as RBS continues its rehabilitation from its state-backed bailout in 2008, prompted by the financial crisis. On Thursday, it said it had closed its so-called ""bad bank"", which was set up to handle toxic assets stemming from the crisis. Earlier this week, RBS passed the Bank of England stress tests, having failed in 2016. In last week's Budget, the government revived plans to sell down its stake in the bank, aiming to sell Â£15bn of its shares by 2023.

"More than 5,000 current and former employees are seeking compensation from Morrisons Morrisons has been found liable for the actions of a former member of its staff who stole the data of thousands of employees and posted it online. Workers brought a claim against the company after employee Andrew Skelton stole the data, including salary and bank details, of nearly 100,000 staff. The High Court ruling now allows those affected to claim compensation for the ""upset and distress"" caused. The case is the first data leak class action in the UK. Morrisons said it believed it should not have been held responsible and would be appealing against the decision. The case follows a security breach in 2014 when Skelton, then a senior internal auditor at the retailer's Bradford headquarters, leaked the payroll data of employees. More on this and other Yorkshire stories He posted the information - including names, addresses, bank account details and salaries - online and and sent it to newspapers. Skelton's motive appeared to have been a grudge over an incident when he was accused of dealing so-called legal highs at work. Andrew Skelton worked as senior internal auditor at the company's Bradford head office He was jailed for eight years in 2015 after being found guilty at Bradford Crown Court of fraud, securing unauthorised access to computer material and disclosing personal data. Lawyers said the data theft meant 5,518 former and current employees were exposed to the risk of identity theft and potential financial loss and that the company was responsible for breaches of privacy, confidence and data protection laws. At the High Court hearing sitting in Leeds, the judge, Mr Justice Langstaff, ruled that Morrisons was vicariously liable, adding that primary liability had not been established. Anya Proops, QC for Morrisons, said Skelton had already caused serious damage to the company and it had incurred more than Â£2m in costs in responding to the misuse. She argued the extent to which an employer could be held liable for the criminal misuse of third-party data by an employee was of ""huge importance"" for individuals, businesses and organisations. Following the ruling, Nick McAleenan of JMW Solicitors, acting for the claimants, said the leak had caused them ""significant worry, stress and inconvenience"". He said: ""This private information belonged to my clients. They are Morrisons checkout staff, shelf stackers, factory workers - ordinary people doing their jobs. ""We welcome the judgment and believe that it is a landmark decision, being the first data leak class action in the UK."" Any further hearing about amounts of compensation will not take place until the company's appeal has concluded.

"An independent review says the cost of converting the Olympic Stadium was Â£323million London Mayor Sadiq Khan has agreed to take over the former Olympic Stadium amid ""financial challenges"". Mr Khan says a ""catalogue of errors"" by his predecessor Boris Johnson led to the costs of transforming it into West Ham United's new ground soaring. An independent review says the conversion cost Â£323m,external- the original estimate was Â£190m. Mayor of Newham Sir Robin Wales said Mr Johnson left the stadium's finances in a ""dreadful mess"". The review says that E20, the public sector company set up to run the London Stadium, is projected to make a loss of Â£20m next year and a total loss of Â£140m over its first 10 years. Mr Khan claims Mr Johnson's decision to make taxpayers foot the bill means Londoners will have to shoulder the predicted loss. London Mayor Sadiq Khan will now take over the running of the former Olympic Stadium He will take control of the stadium in order to ""renegotiate deals"" and ""minimise ongoing losses"". Mr Khan said: ""I ordered the review into the finances of the London Stadium to understand how key decisions were made about its transformation and why costs were allowed to spiral out of control. ""What has been presented is simply staggering."" West Ham were awarded tenancy of the stadium in 2013, however under the agreement theclub would not have to pay for certain running costs. These instead would be paid for by the taxpayer and include policing, stewarding, goalposts, corner flags, cleaners and turnstile operators. However, the review notes that since that deal was signed, policing and stewarding costs have ""increased notably"". West Ham United moved to the London Stadium from Upton Park in August 2016 West Ham said: ""The concession agreementis a watertight, legally binding contract signed in 2013 in good faith by West Ham United, who remain absolutely committed to its terms for the entire 99-year duration. ""It is not in West Ham United's interests for the stadium to be not performing in line with aspiration and, as we have done ever since moving to Stratford in the summer of 2016, we continue to offer the benefit of our commercial expertise and substantial experience in managing successful stadia."" The club added the stadium ""craves renewed leadership"" and it welcomed ""the mayor's decision to step in and deliver this"". Watch:BBC Sports editor Dan Roan on Olympic Stadium legacy,external Newham Council said it received a business plan from E20 in October 2016 which indicated there was likely to be an ""ongoing deficit"" which could make it ""financially unsustainable"" in the long term. Mr Johnson, pictured with Karren Brady, was the Mayor of London between May 2008 and May 2016 An internal review was carried out by the council at the same time the Mayor of London launched his own inquiry. Reacting to Mr Khan's takeover, Sir Robin said: ""On behalf of Newham residents, I am angry that the deals and decisions made by the former Mayor of London and his administration have left the stadium finances in such a dreadful mess. ""It is regrettable that the finances of the stadium have not followed the expected course."" He added it was ""vital"" for Newham that the stadium remained a public asset. A source close to Mr Johnson, who was the Mayor of London between May 2008 and May 2016, rejected the criticisms. He said: ""No other city has an Olympic legacy like London's - all seven venues on the park are in private hands, with millions of visitors a year, and a positive economic legacy for east London. ""The stadium has a secure future with athletics and football. ""The mistakes belonged to Khan's Labour predecessor Ken Livingstone and the Blair government. Signing off on a stadium fit only for athletics was a massive error. The only option for Boris was conversion to a multi-use venue.""

"Thomas Cook has said it is planning to close 50 of its 690 stores as part of a review of its UK retail network. The proposed closures will take place by March next year and will affect up to 400 staff at a mix of Thomas Cook and Co-operative Travel branded stores. ""We hope to redeploy a large proportion of those people,"" a spokesperson said. Thomas Cook says the stores affected are either close to other stores or are located where a fall in customers has hit profitability. The firm would not disclose the location of the stores under threat. Less than half (47%) of its holidays have been booked in store this year, Thomas Cook said, while online sales in the UK grew by 27%. ""We continually review our network of stores across the UK to make sure we're offering customers the best of Thomas Cook, and it is clear that to succeed we have to operate as a truly omni-channel business,"" said Thomas Cook UK's director of retail and customer experience, Kathryn Darbandi. The announcement comes just a week afterthe firm reported that earnings at its UK divisionhad plunged by 40% in the year to 30 September. Rising hotel prices, the fall in the pound and competition in the Spanish market have all affected the travel firm. A spate of fraudulent illness claims and arrangements to help customers caught up in Hurricane Irma had also pushed up costs at the company. At the time, chief executive Peter Fankhauser promised to arrest the slide in the UK, saying it had ""implemented a set of actions to improve performance.""

"Hope of finding the ARA San Juan with surviving crew members has faded The Argentine navy says it has abandoned attempts to rescue 44 crew members on board a submarine that disappeared two weeks ago. ""Despite the magnitude of the efforts made, it has not been possible to locate the submarine,"" navy spokesman Enrique Balbi said on Thursday. The sub, the ARA San Juan, last made contact on Wednesday 15 November. Hopes of finding survivors faded after a suspected explosion was heard near its last-known location. Capt Balbi said the search for the submarine had been ""extended to more than double the number of days that determine the possibilities of rescuing the crew"". His comment refers to the estimated period that it is thought the crew could have survived in the submerged vessel. Enrique Balbi said that the ""phase has changed"" in the search for the missing sub Capt Balbi said that the navy was not able to confirm the fate of the crew, and no evidence of a shipwreck was found in the search area. He said that the search operation, involving numerous vessels and other submarines, was now a hunt for a wreck on the seabed in the area where the ARA San Juan is believed to have vanished. At the Mar Del Plata naval base, both relatives and naval colleagues of those missing broke down upon hearing the news, reported La NaciÃ³n newspaper, with doctors rushing to the aid of the most distraught. Many relatives urged authorities to continue searching vigorously. ""We want them to keep looking, to find the bodies, we need this to begin grieving,"" said Yolanda Mendiola, mother of Petty Officer Leandro Cisneros. The relatives of the sub's crew reacted to the news with sorrow, anger, suspicion - and some with enduring hope Some angrily accused authorities of allowing them to learn the news from the television, and of wanting to ""leave the kids lying in the middle of the sea"". Others held prayer groups and expressed hope that the crew might still be found alive. Some voiced suspicion. ""I want to know what happened and I do not believe in any of the official hypotheses,"" Luis Tagliapietra, whose son was on board, told the TN news channel. ""I have no words for it,"" she said. This video can not be played As hopes faded for the sub, angry relatives said the search operation had been inadequate The ARA San Juan was returning from a routine mission to Ushuaia, near the southernmost tip of South America, when it reported an ""electrical breakdown"". According to naval commander Gabriel Galeazzi, the submarine surfaced and reported what was described as a ""short circuit"" in the vessel's batteries. The sub was ordered to cut its mission short and return to the naval base in Mar del Plata immediately. The Argentine navy's last contact with the vessel was at approximately 07:30 (10:30 GMT) on 15 November, at which point its captain reportedly confirmed that the crew were well. What happens when a submarine vanishes Eight days after the sub vanished, the Vienna-based Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty Organisation said that it had detected a noise a few hours after the sub's last contact. The body, which operates a network of listening posts to monitor nuclear explosions, said that there had been a ""hydro-acoustic anomaly"" about 30 nautical miles (60km) north of the sub's last-known position at 10:31 (13:31 GMT). The Argentine navy said it could have been the sound of the submarine imploding. On Tuesday, Capt Balbi told reporters that water had entered the submarine's snorkel, which can be used to take in air from above the surface when the submarine is submerged. The saltwater dripped onto a battery tray in the prow, causing the battery to short circuit and to smoulder, he said. The sub had reported the fault and had been ordered back to base but then disappeared. The submarine, with its 44 crew, set off under the command of Pedro MartÃ­n FernÃ¡ndez. Forty-three of the crew were men but there was also one woman, Eliana MarÃ­a Krawczyk. The 35-year-old was the first female officer in Argentina to serve on a submarine. The rest of the crew were submariners of varying ages and experience. Who are the crew of missing Argentine submarine? The crew of the ARA San Juan comprises 43 men and one woman The sub's engineer, HernÃ¡n RodrÃ­guez, had been working with the ARA San Juan for 11 years. An international search mission has seen the deployment of 4,000 personnel from more than a dozen countries. Argentine President Mauricio Macri has ordered a probe into the sub's disappearance.

"Hundreds of new drivers have been given automatic bans for using their mobile phones at the wheel, under tougher laws introduced this year. In March, the punishment for driving while on the phone was doubled to six penalty points - enough to ban those with less than two years experience. Figures obtained by Radio 5 live reveal 290 new UK drivers were disqualified in the first six months since the change. RAC road safety spokesman Pete Williams said the figures were sad to see. The new rules about phone use apply in England, Scotland and Wales. Drivers who get six points within two years of passing their test automatically lose their licence. To get back behind the wheel, they have to retake both the theory and practical parts of the driving test. The RAC's Mr Williams said: ""These people have spent hours and hours and hundreds of pounds learning to drive to gain their personal freedom only to throw it all away through this foolish behaviour. ""The only consolation is that they now won't be involved in some horrific crash caused by the distraction of a handheld mobile phone,"" he added. When the new penalties were introduced, Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said they would ""act as a strong deterrent"" to mobile phone users. However, the figures, released by the DVLA under the Freedom of Information Act suggest a total of 15,752 drivers received six penalty points for using a mobile phone between March and August. This is an increase from 15,237 drivers in the same period in 2016. Ben Carvin was 13 when his mother was killed when a lorry driver crashed into her car, while using a mobile phone, Ben said he was forced to grow up 10 years overnight. ""I went from being pretty carefree to feeling I had to be a secondary parent to my sister."" After hearing Ben speak on 5 Live Daily, Jerry, a lorry driver from north London admitted using his phone ""pretty regularly"" and said he would now stop. ""I was always looking at my phone, if I get a call from my boss I will answer that call."" ""I lost my own mother when I was 13."" He said after listening to Ben, he would now use his ""do not disturb"" app. National Police Chiefs' Council lead for roads policing, Chief Constable Anthony Bangham, said the police took the offence seriously. ""This is not a minor offence and is never a risk worth taking because a moment's distraction behind the wheel can change lives forever. ""Our message is simple - don't do it,"" he added.

"Barry Links station is located between Dundee and Carnoustie A railway station in Angus is the least used in Great Britain, new figures have revealed. Just 24 passengers travelled to or from Barry Links station in 2016/17, according to data published by the Office of Rail and Road (ORR) Only two ScotRail trains stop at the station, which is unstaffed and has no facilities, each day between Monday and Saturday. The station, which opened in 1851, is located between Dundee and Carnoustie. Brian Boyd, an independent councillor on Angus Council, said the station was used more than the figures suggested. He said: ""Many people buy Carnoustie tickets but get off at Barry. ""These figures are quoted based on who buys tickets for stations and you can't buy a ticket at Barry so you buy it at Carnoustie. ""I can assure you there's at least a dozen passengers coming off each and every evening from the tea-time train at Barry. ""Yes, there aren't many trains that stop there but the figures are way out, in my opinion."" Mr Boyd, who represents the Carnoustie and District Ward, expects the station to be well-used next summer as golf fans travel to the Open Championship. He said: ""With golf coming in 2018, it will used considerably more because it's right on the perimeter of the world-renowned golf course. ""It's an important station for the area."" Last year's least-used station, Shippea Hill in Cambridgeshire,saw its passenger figures rise from 12 to 156 over the last 12 months. The numbers of people using at Shippea Hill have risen dramatically It received a publicity boost when Great British Bake Off finalist Ian Cumming offered mince pies to people who disembarked at the station on Christmas Eve 2016. The data suggested that Glasgow Central and Edinburgh Waverley are Scotland's busiest railway stations, with 32,060,134 and 22,582,342 entries and exits respectively. London Waterloo maintained its title as Britain's busiest station for the 14th consecutive year. Some 99.4 million passengers used the station in the past year, up by more than 250,000 on 2015/16. The ORR survey,externalcovers 2,560 UK mainland railway stations. Five other stations - Tees-side Airport, Breich, Kildonan, British Steel Redcar, and Reddish South had fewer than 100 entries and exits.

"David Dearlove claimed Paul Booth was injured when he fell out of bed A man who swung his toddler stepson by the ankles and smashed his head into a fireplace has been been jailed for a minimum of 13 years. David Dearlove, 71, murdered 19-month-old Paul Booth at their home in Stockton-on-Tees in October 1968. Paul's brother Peter, who was three years old when he witnessed the attack after he crept downstairs for a drink, went to police in 2015. A jury at Teesside Crown Court convicted Dearlove of murdering Paul. The Facebook post that caught a killer David Dearlove was convicted of murder and three child cruelty charges The inquest into Paul's death in 1968 recorded an open verdict. But in 2015, Peter went to the police after seeing a photo on Facebook of his little brother sitting on Dearlove's knee. He said as a three-year-old he had seen Dearlove, now of Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, swinging Paul round their living room and witnessed the boy's head striking the fireplace. Paul Booth was 19 months old when he died During the trial, Dearlove insisted Paul suffered the fatal head injury when he fell out of bed onto a concrete floor, although he told police when he was arrested in 2015 that the toddler collapsed in the living room. He claimed he changed his story because he had forgotten the events of 1968. The court heard Dearlove had been violent towards Peter and Paul as well as their sister Stephanie Marron who also accused him of cruelty,saying he punched her and pulled her down the stairs. Paul Booth had suffered bruising less than a month before his death A mannequin was used to show jurors how Paul Booth's injuries were inflicted Home Office pathologist Mark Egan demonstrated how the toddler could have died by swinging a doll by the ankles and banging its head on the surface of the witness box, causing some of the 10 men and two women of the jury to weep. He also said he believed it would have taken separate blows to cause the ""z-shaped"" skull fracture on the side of Paul's head. Dearlove was also convicted of three child cruelty charges. Sentencing, Mr Justice Males told him: ""You were a young and no doubt immature man. ""You were also a cruel man and you made the lives of those three young children a misery."" Dearlove swung Paul Booth by his ankles, smashing the toddler's head against the living room fireplace The Crown Prosecution Service said it had not been able to exhume Paul's body as burial records had been lost, with the case relying on the documents prepared for his inquest at the time. In a statement after the verdict, the Booth family said Dearlove's actions ""not only physically killed Paul but also destroyed his memory"". ""He was buried into an unmarked grave the location of which remains unknown and he was not spoken about for many years."" Det Insp Mark Dimelow, from Cleveland Police, said the murder investigation had been ""challenging due to its historic nature"". ""I want to pay tribute to Paul's family and other witnesses who provided such an emotive testimony and I praise their bravery in having to relive events from 50 years ago,"" he added.

Alex HowellBBC Sport football news reporter Crystal Palace are interested in Liverpool forward Ben Doak, who is on loan at Middlesbrough in the Championship as they look for January reinforcements. The Eagles are looking to add a left wing-back and an attacker to their squad to increase the options manager Oliver Glasner has for the second half of the season. Doak has two goals and six assists in 21 appearances for Middlesbrough so far this season. Liverpool have had offers for Doak with clubs in the Premier League and across Europe showing interest in the Scotland winger. Palace have had a Â£15m bid rejected, according to reports. However, the bids so far for 19-year-old do not come close to what the Reds are looking for, with the Anfield club valuing him at about Â£30m. Doak has helped Boro to fifth place in the Championship and are happy with how his stint at the Riverside club is going. They believe he has the quality to return and play for them in the future. The Eagles have also been linked with Jobe Bellingham ofSunderlandand RC Lens midfielder Andy Diouf, but one source has said a move for either midfielder is unlikely this month. Elsewhere,Chelseado have a recall option on Trevoh Chalobah, who is on loan at Selhurst Park but Glasner is ""planning"" for him to stay.

"The battery has been installed in Jamestown, South Australia The world's largest lithium ion battery has begun dispensing power into an electricity grid in South Australia. The 100-megawatt battery, built by Tesla, was officially activated on Friday. It had in fact provided some power since Thursday due to demand caused by local hot weather. South Australia has been crippled by electricity problems in recent times. Tesla boss Elon Musk famously vowed to build the battery within 100 days - a promise that was fulfilled. ""This is history in the making,"" South Australian Premier Jay Weatherill said on Friday. The battery would prevent a repeat of a notorious incident last year where the entire state lost power, Mr Weatherill said. Mr Musk has described it as three times more powerful than the world's next biggest battery. The storm that blacked out a whole state Australia to host 'historic' large battery Can Tesla live up to its value? The idea began when Mr Musk was asked on Twitter if he was serious about helping to resolve South Australia's electricity woes. Mr Musk said he was - adding that if the battery wasn't built within 100 days, the state would receive it for free. The countdown began on 30 September after a plan was approved by the state government and regulators. Tesla finished the battery in about 60 days. Located near Jamestown, about 200km (125 miles) north of Adelaide, the battery is connected to a wind farm run by French energy company Neoen. The project began with a Twitter bet by Tesla boss Elon Musk When fully charged, the battery can power up to 30,000 homes for an hour. However, it will mostly be used to support and stabilise existing electricity supplies. The battery consists of a grid system that runs on the same technology that powers Tesla's cars. In a statement, the company said the completion of the battery ""shows that a sustainable, effective energy solution is possible"". The battery in South Australia is just one of several similar projects with which Tesla is involved. Smaller banks of batteries, also intended to smooth out power supplies, are also installed in Southern California, Hawaii, New Zealand, in the UK and on several Pacific islands. Luxury hotels in South Africa, on islands and in remote locations are also using small power storage systems. The company has also talked about sending more battery packs to Puerto Rico which lost almost all its power generating systems after Hurricane Maria swept across the region. Retailer Target and online giant Amazon have also expressed interest in storing power. Amazon said it was piloting a program to use the batteries at data centres. The power source would keep servers running if electricity is cut and help keep supplies stable. Tesla said the expertise it built up building lithium-ion batteries for its cars helped it develop the bigger power packs for the energy storage systems. The batteries used in energy storage facilities that connect to the grid are not exactly the same as those seen in Tesla cars but have some design elements in common. Tesla has partnered with Panasonic on the development and production of its Powerpack technology. Despite this, it partnered with Samsung on the Southern Australia facility because Panasonic could not produce the required batteries within the tight deadline. Tesla will soon be facing stiff competition from power firms. Next year, a battery storage facility 50% larger than Tesla's in Australia will be turned on in South Korea. Chinese firms and many other renewable energy firms are also installing many battery storage systems for power suppliers around the world. Will Alpine villages really pay you to move there?

"This video can not be played Eve and Basil's Toy Story - as told by the BBC's The One Show A girl has been reunited with the cuddly toy she lost at an airport after images were shared around the world. Eve Mcilquham, 10, was distraught when she left Basil, a toy Labrador, at Glasgow Airport in July as the family travelled to visit her uncle in Canada. Now the pair have been reunited after his ""mugshot"" was shown online. Basil was one of 21 lost toys featured in avideo and picture gallery released by Glasgow Airportin September. This video can not be played Glasgow Airport launches appeal over lost soft toys The video, which features the toys on a luggage carousel, has been seen as far afield as Japan, Germany, Singapore, Jamaica, Australia and Russia. Eve's mother Lorraine Carlton recognised Basil in a video shared on Facebook ""About the fourth teddy in, I recognised that one straight away,"" she told the BBC's The One Show. Eve, from Hamilton, South Lanarkshire, recalled the mix-up that led to Basil being left behind in the departure lounge. ""I thought he was in my bag - or my mum had picked him up. So we went on the flight and he wasn't in my bag. ""I was crying my heart out on the plane. I just thought 'Oh no, I've not got Basil any more'. ""I didn't think I would get him back. I was so excited happy, overwhelmed. He means so much to me. He's the world to me."" In September, Glasgow Airport introduced  ""Take Care of my Bear"" tags to be given out to any child travelling from the airport with a soft toy, to make it easier to reunite them if they are separated. Basil has been issued with a Take Care of my Bear tag, to avoid future mishaps The tags are available at check-in and can be marked with the owner's details. A spokesman for Glasgow Airport said: ""I'm delighted that Eve and Basil have been reunited and that they can spend Christmas together. ""If you and your furry friend are travelling through the airport this festive season, don't forget to pick up your teddy tag at one of our check-in desks."" If a family has lost a cuddly toy or anything else at Glasgow Airport, they are advised to contact Luggage Point based in the main terminal.

"More than 5,000 current and former employees are seeking compensation from Morrisons Morrisons has been found liable for the actions of a former member of its staff who stole the data of thousands of employees and posted it online. Workers brought a claim against the company after employee Andrew Skelton stole the data, including salary and bank details, of nearly 100,000 staff. The High Court ruling now allows those affected to claim compensation for the ""upset and distress"" caused. The case is the first data leak class action in the UK. Morrisons said it believed it should not have been held responsible and would be appealing against the decision. The case follows a security breach in 2014 when Skelton, then a senior internal auditor at the retailer's Bradford headquarters, leaked the payroll data of employees. More on this and other Yorkshire stories He posted the information - including names, addresses, bank account details and salaries - online and and sent it to newspapers. Skelton's motive appeared to have been a grudge over an incident when he was accused of dealing so-called legal highs at work. Andrew Skelton worked as senior internal auditor at the company's Bradford head office He was jailed for eight years in 2015 after being found guilty at Bradford Crown Court of fraud, securing unauthorised access to computer material and disclosing personal data. Lawyers said the data theft meant 5,518 former and current employees were exposed to the risk of identity theft and potential financial loss and that the company was responsible for breaches of privacy, confidence and data protection laws. At the High Court hearing sitting in Leeds, the judge, Mr Justice Langstaff, ruled that Morrisons was vicariously liable, adding that primary liability had not been established. Anya Proops, QC for Morrisons, said Skelton had already caused serious damage to the company and it had incurred more than Â£2m in costs in responding to the misuse. She argued the extent to which an employer could be held liable for the criminal misuse of third-party data by an employee was of ""huge importance"" for individuals, businesses and organisations. Following the ruling, Nick McAleenan of JMW Solicitors, acting for the claimants, said the leak had caused them ""significant worry, stress and inconvenience"". He said: ""This private information belonged to my clients. They are Morrisons checkout staff, shelf stackers, factory workers - ordinary people doing their jobs. ""We welcome the judgment and believe that it is a landmark decision, being the first data leak class action in the UK."" Any further hearing about amounts of compensation will not take place until the company's appeal has concluded.

"This video can not be played Would you notice if you crossed the Irish border? It is not possible to see how the Irish border issue can be resolved after Brexit, the influential group of MPs scrutinising the process has said. The government wants no hard border between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland and no customs border between the latter and the rest of the UK. Ministers have suggested technology could enable a ""frictionless border"". But the Committee for Exiting the EU said the proposals were ""untested"" and ""to some extent speculative"". Ireland's foreign minister Simon Coveney told the BBC his country ""can't be asked to leap into the dark"" by simply accepting UK assurances. Northern Ireland will be the only part of the UK to share a land border with an EU member state after the UK leaves. Why is Northern Ireland border question so hard? Brexit green light â So near, yet so far DUP warns Brexit may jeopardise Tory deal There is currently no physical infrastructure on the border but there is concern that this will have to change after Brexit. If the UK leaves the EU's single market and customs union, as the government intends, the Irish land border will become the external border for the EU's single market and customs union. The Irish Republic wants Northern Ireland to keep following EU rules, so that goods can continue moving across the border - in effect, staying within the customs union and single market. This video can not be played Irish Deputy Prime Minister says UK and Ireland need to agree parameters on border But this would effectively push the customs border out into the Irish Sea, becoming an internal customs border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK - which the UK government rejects. In its report, theExiting the European Union Committee,externalsays it does not see how it will be possible to reconcile these positions. The government has put forward two proposals, one using ""technology-based solutions"", such as pre-screening of goods and trusted trader schemes, to reduce the need for customs checks at the Irish border. The other would involve a ""customs partnership"", with the UK leaving the single market without introducing an EU-UK border - something the UK has admitted would be ""challenging"". The committee is urging the government to set these proposals out in more detail. ""Ministers say they don't want a border, they don't want any infrastructure,"" said its Labour chair Hilary Benn. ""We all agree with that...but self-evidently, the Irish government is not persuaded by what it has read so far."" UK Prime Minister Theresa May has said the UK and Irish governments ""have the same desire"" on the border - to ensure that the movement of trade and people continues ""as now"" and that no new barriers are created. The government added that it remained ""absolutely committed to finding a solution that works for the people of Northern Ireland and Ireland"".

""What the British government has been asking of the Irish government is 'just trust us we'll solve these issues with a broad bold trade agreement',"" he told Radio 4's Today. ""But that may not be possible, we don't know. We can't be asked to leap into the dark by opening up phase two discussions in the hope that these issues might be resolved."" He added: ""The area that we've focused in on is the need to give reassurance that there will not be regulatory divergence between the two jurisdictions on the island of Ireland ""Because if there is it is very hard to avoid a checking system."" Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Partyhas warnedthat any attempt to ""placate Dublin and the EU"" could lead to the end of its confidence-and-supply agreement with the UK's Conservative government. The DUP struck a deal with the minority Conservative government in June, agreeing to support Tory policies at Westminster, in return for an extra Â£1bn in government spending for Northern Ireland. The Committee for Exiting the EU itself was split over the report, with five of its 21 members -  four Conservatives and a DUP MP - voting to reject it. The report also includes a call for the government to publish the likely terms of any transition period governing what will happen immediately after Brexit in March 2019. It says it is ""essential"" that the details of the arrangements be published by the end of March so as to give businesses enough time to prepare.

"Emmerson Mnangagwa has promised a ""new democracy"" for Zimbabwe Zimbabwe's new President Emmerson Mnangagwa has named his cabinet, appointing senior military figures to high-profile positions. Critics have said that it has dashed hopes of change in the country. Mr Mnangagwa was inaugurated as president last week. He took over from Robert Mugabe who had been in power for 37 years. Mr Mugabe stepped down after the army took control of the country, following a power struggle in the ruling party. Thousands of people celebrated Mr Mugabe's resignation as they hoped the failed economy would improve. Some had hoped that President Mnangagwa would appoint members of the opposition to his cabinet, to form a transitional government until elections next year but this did not happen. Africa Live: Updates on this and more stories The appointments led government critic Tendai Biti to suggest that Zimbabweans were ""wrong"" to have hoped for change.""Up until now, we had given the putsch the benefit of the doubt. We did so in the genuine, perhaps naive view that the country could actually move forward. We craved change, peace & stability in our country. How wrong we were,"" he said. Many Zimbabweans celebrated the ousting of Robert Mugabe Wilf Mbanga, a Zimbabwean journalist who lives in exile in South Africa, told the BBC that the new minister of agriculture Perence Shiri ""was not known for his love of democracy"". A minister who served in Mr Mugabe's government, Jonathan Moyo, said the changes meant that Zanu-PF, the party which has governed Zimbabwe since independence in 1980, was ""dead"" and the military was now in charge. Newspaper owner Trevor Ncube said the cabinet was ""very disappointing"". ""Largely the same people that caused this crisis have been recycled. The honeymoon comes to an end and reality dawns. His concern seems to have been rewarding those who brought him to power and Zanu-PF unity,"" he said. Sibusiso Moyo, the general who became the face of the recent military takeover, is the new foreign minister. In his announcement, he was at pains to deny that the military takeover was a coup so some will criticise his promotion to the cabinet. He holds a PhD in International Relations and at one point was the leader of the elite military unit, known as the ""green berets squad"". The head of Zimbabwe's air force, Perence Shiri, was named the minister of agriculture and land affairs. He is notorious for having led the military operation against those seen as opponents of Mr Mugabe in Matabeleland in the early 1980s. The operation, led by the North-Korean trained Fifth Brigade of the army, resulted in the killing of an estimated 20,000 civilians. As lands minister, he will presumably be in charge of Zimbabwe's controversial land reform programme. This saw the seizure of thousands of farms owned by the white minority which had previously been in charge of the country. Critics say this wrecked Zimbabwe's once thriving economy and led millions of Zimbabweans to leave the country to find work. Zimbabwe after Mugabe: What happens next? How Zimbabwe's new leader will be different Mnangagwa: The 'crocodile' who snapped back Five things Zimbabwe's economy urgently needs Ten numbers that will help you understand what's going on Aside from Maj Gen Moyo and Air Marshal Shiri, leaders of the powerful war veterans' association, who pushed for Mr Mugabe to go after the military intervention, also got cabinet jobs. Chris Mutsvangwa, who heads the group, is now in charge at the information ministry. Critics say that Mr Mnangagwa has rewarded those whose actions led to him becoming president. There was a power struggle over who might replace the 93-year-old president, with Mr Mnangagwa and Mr Mugabe's wife, Grace, on opposite sides. Mr Mnangagwa was accused of plotting to take power and Mr Mugabe sacked him as vice-president. This video can not be played Young Zimbabweans: We need fairness not corruption Mr Mnangagwa fled Zimbabwe and the military intervened. On 14 November, military vehicles rolled into Zimbabwe's capital, Harare, detaining Mr Mugabe and placing him under house arrest. He agreed to resign and Mr Mnangagwa returned to a hero's welcome and was made president. Mr Mnangagwa has been part of the country's ruling elite for decades, having been minister of defence, security and justice. Despite pledging a ""new democracy"" for Zimbabwe, Mr Mnangagwa is still associated by many with some of the worst atrocities committed under Zanu-PF. The two new vice-presidents have not been appointed yet. The BBC's Shingai Nyoka in Harare says all eyes are on the general who led the military takeover Gen Constantino Chiwenga. Zimbabwean commentators are waiting to see whether he will be rewarded with a vice-presidency. What next for Zimbabwe? Mugabe has gone, but will Zimbabwe change?

"Thomas Cook has said it is planning to close 50 of its 690 stores as part of a review of its UK retail network. The proposed closures will take place by March next year and will affect up to 400 staff at a mix of Thomas Cook and Co-operative Travel branded stores. ""We hope to redeploy a large proportion of those people,"" a spokesperson said. Thomas Cook says the stores affected are either close to other stores or are located where a fall in customers has hit profitability. The firm would not disclose the location of the stores under threat. Less than half (47%) of its holidays have been booked in store this year, Thomas Cook said, while online sales in the UK grew by 27%. ""We continually review our network of stores across the UK to make sure we're offering customers the best of Thomas Cook, and it is clear that to succeed we have to operate as a truly omni-channel business,"" said Thomas Cook UK's director of retail and customer experience, Kathryn Darbandi. The announcement comes just a week afterthe firm reported that earnings at its UK divisionhad plunged by 40% in the year to 30 September. Rising hotel prices, the fall in the pound and competition in the Spanish market have all affected the travel firm. A spate of fraudulent illness claims and arrangements to help customers caught up in Hurricane Irma had also pushed up costs at the company. At the time, chief executive Peter Fankhauser promised to arrest the slide in the UK, saying it had ""implemented a set of actions to improve performance.""

"Inspectors also found a backlog of 23,000 X-rays at the hospital A hospital failed to spot cases of lung cancer because it did not check patients' chest X-rays properly, the Care Quality Commission has found. The health watchdog found that three patients at Queen Alexandra Hospital in Portsmouth suffered ""significant harm"". It emerged that junior doctors complained they had been asked to carry out specialist radiology work without the appropriate training. The CQC has now launched a review of NHS radiology services in England. All NHS bodies have been instructed to provide details about their backlogs, turnaround times, staffing and arrangements for routine reporting of images. Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust said it had made an unreserved apology to the families of the three patients, two of whom have died. During their visit in July, CQC inspectors also found the hospital had a backlog of 23,000 chest X-rays. None of the 23,000 images from the preceding 12 months had been formally reviewed by a radiologist or appropriately-trained clinician. During the visit, inspectors learned some junior doctors had been given responsibility for reviewing the chest and abdomen X-rays. Prof Ted Baker, from the CQC, said ""When a patient is referred for an X-ray or scan, it is important that the resulting images are examined and reported on by properly trained clinical staff who know what they are looking for - this is a specialist skill."" Following the inspection, the trust has had to put in place steps to make sure images are examined and reported on by properly trained clinical staff. It was also tasked with providing a weekly report of the number of outstanding X-rays to the CQC and told it must notify those patients if their X-ray was held up. In August, the CQCrated the hospital's medical care ""inadequate"". Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust chief executive Mark Cubbon said: ""We have issued an unreserved apology to the families of the three patients who experienced harm because of the delays to their care. ""We have carried out a thorough review of the scans and X-rays reported so far; to date nearly 50% of the backlog has been cleared and we are in touch with any patients as necessary."" The trust has set up a free phone helpline - 0800 7837118 - for anyone who is concerned they may be affected. The hospital in Cosham has 975 beds and provides services to a local population of about 610,000 people.

"More than 5,000 current and former employees are seeking compensation from Morrisons Morrisons has been found liable for the actions of a former member of its staff who stole the data of thousands of employees and posted it online. Workers brought a claim against the company after employee Andrew Skelton stole the data, including salary and bank details, of nearly 100,000 staff. The High Court ruling now allows those affected to claim compensation for the ""upset and distress"" caused. The case is the first data leak class action in the UK. Morrisons said it believed it should not have been held responsible and would be appealing against the decision. The case follows a security breach in 2014 when Skelton, then a senior internal auditor at the retailer's Bradford headquarters, leaked the payroll data of employees. More on this and other Yorkshire stories He posted the information - including names, addresses, bank account details and salaries - online and and sent it to newspapers. Skelton's motive appeared to have been a grudge over an incident when he was accused of dealing so-called legal highs at work. Andrew Skelton worked as senior internal auditor at the company's Bradford head office He was jailed for eight years in 2015 after being found guilty at Bradford Crown Court of fraud, securing unauthorised access to computer material and disclosing personal data. Lawyers said the data theft meant 5,518 former and current employees were exposed to the risk of identity theft and potential financial loss and that the company was responsible for breaches of privacy, confidence and data protection laws. At the High Court hearing sitting in Leeds, the judge, Mr Justice Langstaff, ruled that Morrisons was vicariously liable, adding that primary liability had not been established. Anya Proops, QC for Morrisons, said Skelton had already caused serious damage to the company and it had incurred more than Â£2m in costs in responding to the misuse. She argued the extent to which an employer could be held liable for the criminal misuse of third-party data by an employee was of ""huge importance"" for individuals, businesses and organisations. Following the ruling, Nick McAleenan of JMW Solicitors, acting for the claimants, said the leak had caused them ""significant worry, stress and inconvenience"". He said: ""This private information belonged to my clients. They are Morrisons checkout staff, shelf stackers, factory workers - ordinary people doing their jobs. ""We welcome the judgment and believe that it is a landmark decision, being the first data leak class action in the UK.""

"Major changes to the law have come into effect for Scotland's 760,000 private renters. The private residential tenancy rules will bring an end to fixed-term rentals, meaning leases will effectively be open-ended. Rent increases can only be made once every 12 months, and tenants who believe them to be unfair can take them to a rent officer. Shelter Scotland described the change as a ""new dawn"" for private renters. Anyone signing a tenancy from 1 December will be covered by the new rules. All landlord and tenant disputes will be heard in a new specialist tribunal and, from next month, all letting agents will have to register and adhere to a code of practice. Tenants will have indefinite security of tenure, meaning ""no-fault"" evictions will no longer be possible. Other key measures include: Longer notice periods, with tenants who have been in a property for more than six months receiving at least 84 day notice to leave, unless they are at fault Simpler notices, with a simpler notice to leave process The introduction of a model tenancy agreement which can be used by landlords to set up a tenancy The new law does, however, allow landlords to ask tenants to leave on a number of grounds, including wanting to sell or refurbish the property or if they intend to live there themselves. If the tenant fails to vacate at the end of the notice period, the landlord can apply to a tribunal for an eviction notice. The new law has been welcomed by housing charity Shelter Scotland. Director Graeme Brown said: ""Today represents a new dawn for all private renters in Scotland. ""These new laws bring unprecedented security of tenure to private renters, with landlords now needing a good reason to evict tenants. ""We have campaigned passionately for 10 years now for reform of private renting in Scotland, ending with our Make Renting Right campaign, which had extensive support from the public and local and national politicians."" He added: ""Shelter Scotland is pleased to be working with the Scottish government ona major awareness raising campaign,externalto ensure that everyone involved in private renting - from tenants and landlords to letting agents and housing professionals - understand their new rights and responsibilities."" Independent property specialists Rettie and Co have landlords and tenants as clients. Their director of research Dr John Boyle said: ""It will make things a bit easier to organise. It should be a smoother process with less paperwork."" He pointed out that most tenants and landlords have a good relationship, but said the rules will change when things go wrong. ""The end of no-fault possession will be a concern,"" he said. ""(But) there are grounds for possession and these may prove to be workable."" Dr Boyle said some owners will worry that there is no initial minimum period of rental. He said: ""In essence, the tenant has long-term security but the landlord does not. That weakens security for the landlord."" In areas like Edinburgh, Dr Boyle said there may be problems for landlords who rent to students during term-time, then to festival-goers in the summer. Some landlords may decide to pull out of the student letting sector if they cannot be sure of students moving out at the end of the academic year. The legislation also allows for Rent Pressure Zones, where annual rent increases would be capped. Dr Boyle points out that, in other countries with similar regulations, long waiting lists for housing can build up. But the Scottish government believes it has struck the right balance between the needs of tenants and landlords. Housing minister Kevin Stewart said: ""This is the biggest change to the sector for a generation and will bring about significant improvements in private renting, benefiting both tenants and landlords. ""We want to ensure everyone has a safe and warm place to call home. ""The new tenancy sits alongside our wider ambitions for housing in Scotland - not least our ambitious commitment to deliver at least 50,000 affordable homes during this parliament, including that for rent."" Leanne McGuire has lived in the private rented sector for most of her adult life. With her daughter Cleone to consider, she says security of tenure has become very important. ""I've lived in private rent from when I was about 20, so you're talking 17 years I've been private renting. ""In those 17 years, I've had four or five flats sold from under me. ""Before I had Cleone, I moved around a lot - of course I did because you're younger and you don't really have a lot of responsibilities. ""If I didn't like a flat that was fine. I just moved our after six months. ""But since having Cleone we've settled and unfortunately that first flat that we had together - it was very sudden - I had been paying rent but the landlord hadn't been paying his mortgage. ""We ended up having to be evicted from there and move on. ""That's quite stressful. ""Then the next flat we stayed in for seven years, which was great. ""We had put down a lot of roots. That's where Cleone grew up, almost. ""Unfortunately we found out last year that (the landlord) wanted to sell and he gave us two months to find somewhere else.""

"Hope of finding the ARA San Juan with surviving crew members has faded The Argentine navy says it has abandoned attempts to rescue 44 crew members on board a submarine that disappeared two weeks ago. ""Despite the magnitude of the efforts made, it has not been possible to locate the submarine,"" navy spokesman Enrique Balbi said on Thursday. The sub, the ARA San Juan, last made contact on Wednesday 15 November. Hopes of finding survivors faded after a suspected explosion was heard near its last-known location. Capt Balbi said the search for the submarine had been ""extended to more than double the number of days that determine the possibilities of rescuing the crew"". His comment refers to the estimated period that it is thought the crew could have survived in the submerged vessel. Enrique Balbi said that the ""phase has changed"" in the search for the missing sub Capt Balbi said that the navy was not able to confirm the fate of the crew, and no evidence of a shipwreck was found in the search area. He said that the search operation, involving numerous vessels and other submarines, was now a hunt for a wreck on the seabed in the area where the ARA San Juan is believed to have vanished. At the Mar Del Plata naval base, both relatives and naval colleagues of those missing broke down upon hearing the news, reported La NaciÃ³n newspaper, with doctors rushing to the aid of the most distraught. Many relatives urged authorities to continue searching vigorously. ""We want them to keep looking, to find the bodies, we need this to begin grieving,"" said Yolanda Mendiola, mother of Petty Officer Leandro Cisneros. The relatives of the sub's crew reacted to the news with sorrow, anger, suspicion - and some with enduring hope Some angrily accused authorities of allowing them to learn the news from the television, and of wanting to ""leave the kids lying in the middle of the sea"". Others held prayer groups and expressed hope that the crew might still be found alive. Some voiced suspicion. ""I want to know what happened and I do not believe in any of the official hypotheses,"" Luis Tagliapietra, whose son was on board, told the TN news channel. ""I have no words for it,"" she said. This video can not be played As hopes faded for the sub, angry relatives said the search operation had been inadequate The ARA San Juan was returning from a routine mission to Ushuaia, near the southernmost tip of South America, when it reported an ""electrical breakdown"". According to naval commander Gabriel Galeazzi, the submarine surfaced and reported what was described as a ""short circuit"" in the vessel's batteries. The sub was ordered to cut its mission short and return to the naval base in Mar del Plata immediately. The Argentine navy's last contact with the vessel was at approximately 07:30 (10:30 GMT) on 15 November, at which point its captain reportedly confirmed that the crew were well. What happens when a submarine vanishes Eight days after the sub vanished, the Vienna-based Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty Organisation said that it had detected a noise a few hours after the sub's last contact. The body, which operates a network of listening posts to monitor nuclear explosions, said that there had been a ""hydro-acoustic anomaly"" about 30 nautical miles (60km) north of the sub's last-known position at 10:31 (13:31 GMT). The Argentine navy said it could have been the sound of the submarine imploding. On Tuesday, Capt Balbi told reporters that water had entered the submarine's snorkel, which can be used to take in air from above the surface when the submarine is submerged. The saltwater dripped onto a battery tray in the prow, causing the battery to short circuit and to smoulder, he said. The sub had reported the fault and had been ordered back to base but then disappeared. The submarine, with its 44 crew, set off under the command of Pedro MartÃ­n FernÃ¡ndez. Forty-three of the crew were men but there was also one woman, Eliana MarÃ­a Krawczyk. The 35-year-old was the first female officer in Argentina to serve on a submarine. The rest of the crew were submariners of varying ages and experience. Who are the crew of missing Argentine submarine? The crew of the ARA San Juan comprises 43 men and one woman The sub's engineer, HernÃ¡n RodrÃ­guez, had been working with the ARA San Juan for 11 years. An international search mission has seen the deployment of 4,000 personnel from more than a dozen countries. Argentine President Mauricio Macri has ordered a probe into the sub's disappearance.

"Hundreds of new drivers have been given automatic bans for using their mobile phones at the wheel, under tougher laws introduced this year. In March, the punishment for driving while on the phone was doubled to six penalty points - enough to ban those with less than two years experience. Figures obtained by Radio 5 live reveal 290 new UK drivers were disqualified in the first six months since the change. RAC road safety spokesman Pete Williams said the figures were sad to see. The new rules about phone use apply in England, Scotland and Wales. Drivers who get six points within two years of passing their test automatically lose their licence. To get back behind the wheel, they have to retake both the theory and practical parts of the driving test. The RAC's Mr Williams said: ""These people have spent hours and hours and hundreds of pounds learning to drive to gain their personal freedom only to throw it all away through this foolish behaviour. ""The only consolation is that they now won't be involved in some horrific crash caused by the distraction of a handheld mobile phone,"" he added. When the new penalties were introduced, Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said they would ""act as a strong deterrent"" to mobile phone users. However, the figures, released by the DVLA under the Freedom of Information Act suggest a total of 15,752 drivers received six penalty points for using a mobile phone between March and August. This is an increase from 15,237 drivers in the same period in 2016. Ben Carvin was 13 when his mother was killed when a lorry driver crashed into her car, while using a mobile phone, Ben said he was forced to grow up 10 years overnight. ""I went from being pretty carefree to feeling I had to be a secondary parent to my sister."" After hearing Ben speak on 5 Live Daily, Jerry, a lorry driver from north London admitted using his phone ""pretty regularly"" and said he would now stop. ""I was always looking at my phone, if I get a call from my boss I will answer that call."" ""I lost my own mother when I was 13."" He said after listening to Ben, he would now use his ""do not disturb"" app. National Police Chiefs' Council lead for roads policing, Chief Constable Anthony Bangham, said the police took the offence seriously. ""This is not a minor offence and is never a risk worth taking because a moment's distraction behind the wheel can change lives forever. ""Our message is simple - don't do it,"" he added.

"RBS is closing 259 branches - one in four of its outlets - and cutting 680 jobs as more customers bank online. The closures involve 62 Royal Bank of Scotland and 197 NatWest branches. RBS, which is 71%-owned by the taxpayer, said it would try to ensure compulsory redundancies were ""kept to an absolute minimum"". The bank said use of its branches by customers had fallen 40% since 2014, but the Unite union, which represents bank staff, called the cuts ""savage"". Following the closures, the RBS group will be left with 744 branches. See the full list of branch closures here RBS's branch closure announcement is the third such this week, following Lloyds, which on Wednesday said it would close 49 branches, and Yorkshire Building Society, which said it would close 13 branches. An RBS spokesperson said: ""More and more of our customers are choosing to do their everyday banking online or on mobile. ""Since 2014 the number of customers using our branches across the UK has fallen by 40% and mobile transactions have increased by 73% over the same period. Over 5 million customers now use our mobile banking app and one in five only bank with us digitally. ""We realise this is difficult news for our colleagues and we are doing everything we can to support those affected."" Who do you trust after cash? Can a bank in a box replace a branch? RBS to close a quarter of branches in Scotland RBS brings curtain down on 'toxic' bank Unite said serious questions needed to be asked about whether the closures marked the end of branch network banking. Rob MacGregor, Unite national officer, said: ""This announcement will forever change the face of banking in this country resulting in over a thousand staff losing their jobs and hundreds of High Streets without any banking facilities. ""The closure of another 259 branches is savage. Why is the government signing off this alarming branch closure programme?"" RBS, like many of its competitors, says that branch use has dropped dramatically as people bank on the go. Industry analysts CACI forecasts that typical consumers will only visit a bank branch four times a year by 2022, as virtually all transactions or paperwork can be done online, or by letter or at a post office. Yet visiting a branch remains a way of life for many people - older people and small businesses particularly. A report into branch closures by Professor Russel Griggs likened losing a local branch to a ""bereavement"" for some people. So what is being done for them? The major banks have signed up to a protocol that ensures specially trained staff are in place to help customers find alternatives when a local branch is closing, such as using the Post Office. They must work more proactively to support elderly and vulnerable customers, and tell communities as quickly as possible after the decision has been made. Paul Wheelhouse, Scottish Government Minister for Business, Innovation and Energy, said: ""The news of further branch closures from RBS will be hugely concerning to many people in Scotland as it now not only affects, potentially, staff at RBS but also leaves large areas of Scotland, particularly rural areas, with limited branch coverage. ""While recognising that footfall in branches is falling, due to online banking, RBS, and other banks, must take into account the needs of all customers - not just those who can access and use digital services."" The news comes as RBS continues its rehabilitation from its state-backed bailout in 2008, prompted by the financial crisis. On Thursday, it said it had closed its so-called ""bad bank"", which was set up to handle toxic assets stemming from the crisis. Earlier this week, RBS passed the Bank of England stress tests, having failed in 2016. In last week's Budget, the government revived plans to sell down its stake in the bank, aiming to sell Â£15bn of its shares by 2023.

"This video can not be played May: We're not afraid to say when US has got it wrong UK Prime Minister Theresa May has said Donald Trump was ""wrong"" to retweet posts from a British far-right group. But she stressed the ""special relationship"" between Britain and the US was ""in both our nations' interests"" and should continue. And she rejected calls to cancel a state visit by the US president. Speaking on a visit to Jordan, she said: ""An invitation for a state visit has been extended and has been accepted. We have yet to set a date."" Minister 'uncomfortable' with Trump visit Trump, Twitter and his 'filter bubble' When Theresa met Donald: Will US hold our hand now? Quizzed about Mr Trump's tweets, she said: ""The fact that we work together does not mean that we're afraid to say when we think the United States has got it wrong, and be very clear with them.

The BBC's deputy political editor John Pienaarsaid in his blogthat ""managing a calm and stable relationship with a president like Donald Trump looks like a task that's well beyond Theresa May - and arguably - anyone else"". Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she agreed with Theresa May's criticism of Mr Trump, but thought she should go further and halt plans for a state visit next year.

Theresa May and Donald Trump meeting at the UN General Assembly By Anthony Zurcher, North America reporter It's clear at this point that Donald Trump won't let a perceived slight or criticism go unanswered - even if it's from a supposed friend. Even if it's from the leader of the president's closest international ally. So shock isn't exactly the right word to describe the reaction to Mr Trump's initially botched attempt to tell Theresa May to, in effect, mind her own business. This is just another example of the US president's self-described ""modern-day presidential"" use of social media, where Twitter is a cudgel for score-settling no matter the diplomatic cost. When Mr Trump assumed the presidency, one of the first foreign dignitaries he received was Mrs May, and it appeared they formed a quick bond -briefly holding hands as they walked past the White House Rose Garden. Those bonds will now be tested in a spat over a few morning retweets of inflammatory videos. It's a wholly unnecessary controversy, but the international consequences could be all too real. Read more from Anthony The US and the UK are close allies and often described as having a ""special relationship"". Theresa May was the first foreign leader to visit the Trump White House. The row was raised in the House of Commons on Thursday morning with Home Secretary Amber Rudd saying she hoped Mrs May's criticism ""would have some impact on the president"". Responding to a call by MP Peter Bone for the president to delete his Twitter account, she said: ""It's interesting to note [Mr Bone's] advice regarding Twitter accounts - I'm sure many of us might share his view."" Former Conservative minister Tim Loughton said if Twitter was ""genuine in its commitment to fight hate crime online"" it would delete the US president's account. Veteran Labour MP Paul Flynn asked whether Mr Trump should be ""charged with inciting racial hatred"" if he comes to the UK, a view echoed by fellow Labour MP Naz Shah. This video can not be played Should Donald Trump get a state visit to the UK? The UK's opposition party is Labour - their foreign affairs spokeswoman Emily Thornberry told BBC Radio 5 live that Donald Trump was ""not America"" and the government should ""ignore"" and ""work round him"". The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, the senior bishop in the Church of England, said it was ""deeply disturbing"" that Mr Trump had ""chosen to amplify the voice of far-right extremists"". The videos shared by Mr Trump, who has more than 40 million followers, were initially posted by Jayda Fransen, the deputy leader of Britain First, a group founded by former members of the far-right British National Party. Ms Fransen, 31, has been charged in the UK with using ""threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour"" over speeches she made at a rally in Belfast. At a White House briefing on Thursday, spokeswoman Sarah Sanders was asked if the president knew who Ms Fransen was when he retweeted. She said: ""No, I don't believe so. But I think he knew what the issues are and that is that we have a real threat of extreme violence and terrorism."" This video can not be played Ann Coulter defends the US president on Today after he hit out at Theresa May over far-right tweets On Wednesday, communities Secretary Sajid Javid said Mr Trump had ""endorsed the views of a vile, hate-filled racist organisation that hates me and people like me"", adding: ""He is wrong and I refuse to let it go and say nothing."" London Mayor Sadiq Khan repeated his call the state visit to be cancelled, saying:  ""It beggars belief that the president of our closest ally doesn't see that his support of this extremist group actively undermines the values of tolerance and diversity that makes Britain so great."" After already condemning Mr Trump's actions on Wednesday, Brendan Cox - whose wife, MP Jo Cox, was murdered by a right-wing extremist who shouted ""Britain first"" before committing the act - told the US president to focus on problems in his own country.

"This video can not be played Prince Harry and Meghan Markle during their 2017 visit to Nottingham Meghan Markle has had a taste of royal life, as she joined her fiance Prince Harry on their first joint official public engagement in Nottingham. Excited crowds cheered as the couple greeted well-wishers ahead of a visit to a World Aids Day charity fair hosted by the Terrence Higgins Trust. They split up to talk to people lining both sides of their route and were given cards, flowers and chocolate. After the charity fair, they met head teachers at a nearby school. Well-wishers gathered in the city ahead of the visit to catch a glimpse of the couple, including Helena Bottomley, Zoe Scott and Carole Bingham, from East and West Bridgford. Ms Scott said: ""We love the royals. We are genuinely happy for Harry."" ""We all had our children at the same time as Diana [Princess of Wales] so we feel a real allegiance. She would be so thrilled,"" said Ms Bottomley. The couple announced their engagement on Monday and are due to marry at Windsor Castle in May. Crowds share Harry and Meghan's 'fairytale' moment How Meghan made her mark as a 'real deal' campaigner One of the people Prince Harry stopped to speak to was Julie Ball, 51, of Netherfield, who said the prince had commented on her Santa gloves. ""He said 'great gloves' and pulled one down over my fingers,"" she said. ""I said they're from Primark for Â£3. ""When Meghan walked past she said the same thing. She said, 'We have the same taste.'"" Harry and Meghan to wed at Windsor in May WATCH: Full interview with Prince Harry and Meghan Markle How will Meghan Markle become a British citizen?

Royal fan Irene Hardman had a goody bag ready to hand over to the couple, including copies of the local paper and two fridge magnets ""so they don't fight over it"". Speaking afterwards, the 81-year-old said: ""I cried - she's wonderful, and it's fantastic. They're so genuine."" By BBC royal correspondent, Sarah Campbell They are due to marry at Windsor Castle in May By the time the royal couple arrived, the pavements in the Lace Market were packed. Prince Harry and Meghan spent around half an hour meeting the people of Nottingham who had come out in force despite the cold. Meghan appeared very relaxed and perfectly at ease. This was her first official royal engagement with Harry and if she was nervous at all it did not show. She smiled, she chatted, at one point she even picked up someone's glove and handed it back to them. This was a confident first public appearance. The couple split up at points to cover both parts of the pavement and meet the maximum number of people. Meghan was happy to shake hands with the crowd and as she wasn't wearing gloves, the ring was on show. Tactile with her fiancÃ©e and the crowd - it's fair to say the response from the people was overwhelmingly positive. After the walkabout, Prince Harry and Ms Markle went to the Nottingham Contemporary Exhibition Centre for an event to mark World Aids Day. Dominic Edwards, from the Terrence Higgins Trust, told the BBC the charity was ""thrilled"" the couple had chosen to visit Nottingham, and said: ""I think it really underlines his great support for HIV as a cause."" Royal commentator Richard FitzWilliams, said this visit represented a link with the legacy of Princess Diana's influential work on HIV 30 years ago and was ""no coincidence"". Allow Twitter content?

Prince Harry has spent time in Nottingham both publicly and privately since he first met young people there in 2013, when he was exploring issues around youth violence. A year later, he established the Full Effect programme, which aims to stop youth violence in the city. At Nottingham Academy, the couple will watch a ""hip hopera"" and meet students. The handbag Ms Markle chose to carry on her Nottingham visit has already sold out. The bag was made by the Scottish label, Strathberry, which said ""it was a fantastic surprise"" to see the bride-to-be carrying one of its designs. Ms Markle was wrapped up in a long navy coat by Mackage - a brand also favoured by actresses Gwyneth Paltrow, Halle Berry, Eva Mendes and Blake Lively. She wore the coat over a beige cotton, full midi skirt from British-based fashion label Joseph, priced at Â£595, which also sold out on the brand's website. Who is Meghan Markle? Profile: Prince Harry On Tuesday, the couple's spokesman said Ms Markle would not be continuing her work on gender with the United Nations or with other organisations and instead would start new charity work as a full-time royal. Mr Knauf said she planned to focus her attention on the UK and Commonwealth. ""This is the country that's going to be her home now and that means travelling around, getting to know the towns and cities and smaller communities,"" he said. She will also become the fourth patron of the Royal Foundation of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry. The foundation is behind Prince Harry's Invictus Games - the Paralympic-style competition for injured servicemen and women and veterans - and also the mental health charity Heads Together.

"Major changes to the law have come into effect for Scotland's 760,000 private renters. The private residential tenancy rules will bring an end to fixed-term rentals, meaning leases will effectively be open-ended. Rent increases can only be made once every 12 months, and tenants who believe them to be unfair can take them to a rent officer. Shelter Scotland described the change as a ""new dawn"" for private renters. Anyone signing a tenancy from 1 December will be covered by the new rules. All landlord and tenant disputes will be heard in a new specialist tribunal and, from next month, all letting agents will have to register and adhere to a code of practice. Tenants will have indefinite security of tenure, meaning ""no-fault"" evictions will no longer be possible. Other key measures include: Longer notice periods, with tenants who have been in a property for more than six months receiving at least 84 day notice to leave, unless they are at fault Simpler notices, with a simpler notice to leave process The introduction of a model tenancy agreement which can be used by landlords to set up a tenancy The new law does, however, allow landlords to ask tenants to leave on a number of grounds, including wanting to sell or refurbish the property or if they intend to live there themselves. If the tenant fails to vacate at the end of the notice period, the landlord can apply to a tribunal for an eviction notice. The new law has been welcomed by housing charity Shelter Scotland. Director Graeme Brown said: ""Today represents a new dawn for all private renters in Scotland. ""These new laws bring unprecedented security of tenure to private renters, with landlords now needing a good reason to evict tenants. ""We have campaigned passionately for 10 years now for reform of private renting in Scotland, ending with our Make Renting Right campaign, which had extensive support from the public and local and national politicians."" He added: ""Shelter Scotland is pleased to be working with the Scottish government ona major awareness raising campaign,externalto ensure that everyone involved in private renting - from tenants and landlords to letting agents and housing professionals - understand their new rights and responsibilities."" Independent property specialists Rettie and Co have landlords and tenants as clients. Their director of research Dr John Boyle said: ""It will make things a bit easier to organise. It should be a smoother process with less paperwork."" He pointed out that most tenants and landlords have a good relationship, but said the rules will change when things go wrong. ""The end of no-fault possession will be a concern,"" he said. ""(But) there are grounds for possession and these may prove to be workable."" Dr Boyle said some owners will worry that there is no initial minimum period of rental. He said: ""In essence, the tenant has long-term security but the landlord does not. That weakens security for the landlord."" In areas like Edinburgh, Dr Boyle said there may be problems for landlords who rent to students during term-time, then to festival-goers in the summer. Some landlords may decide to pull out of the student letting sector if they cannot be sure of students moving out at the end of the academic year. The legislation also allows for Rent Pressure Zones, where annual rent increases would be capped. Dr Boyle points out that, in other countries with similar regulations, long waiting lists for housing can build up. But the Scottish government believes it has struck the right balance between the needs of tenants and landlords. Housing minister Kevin Stewart said: ""This is the biggest change to the sector for a generation and will bring about significant improvements in private renting, benefiting both tenants and landlords. ""We want to ensure everyone has a safe and warm place to call home. ""The new tenancy sits alongside our wider ambitions for housing in Scotland - not least our ambitious commitment to deliver at least 50,000 affordable homes during this parliament, including that for rent."" Leanne McGuire has lived in the private rented sector for most of her adult life. With her daughter Cleone to consider, she says security of tenure has become very important. ""I've lived in private rent from when I was about 20, so you're talking 17 years I've been private renting. ""In those 17 years, I've had four or five flats sold from under me. ""Before I had Cleone, I moved around a lot - of course I did because you're younger and you don't really have a lot of responsibilities. ""If I didn't like a flat that was fine. I just moved our after six months. ""But since having Cleone we've settled and unfortunately that first flat that we had together - it was very sudden - I had been paying rent but the landlord hadn't been paying his mortgage. ""We ended up having to be evicted from there and move on. ""That's quite stressful. ""Then the next flat we stayed in for seven years, which was great. ""We had put down a lot of roots. That's where Cleone grew up, almost. ""Unfortunately we found out last year that (the landlord) wanted to sell and he gave us two months to find somewhere else.""

"Before Charlie Dunn was pulled out of the lagoon his stepfather was heard swearing about not knowing where the youngster was A five-year-old boy was found drowned more than two hours after his mother and stepfather let him ""go off by himself"", a court heard. Charlie Dunn, who could not swim, was pulled from a lagoon at Bosworth Water Park in Leicestershire in July 2016. His stepfather Paul Smith was overheard saying he did not know where the boy was, Birmingham Crown Court was told. Charlie's mother Lynsey Dunn and Mr Smith, from Tamworth, Staffordshire, deny causing death by gross negligence. Lynsey Dunn and Paul Smith deny causing Charlie's death by gross negligence by permitting him to enter a bathing area unsupervised Charlie was pulled from the 1.4-metre deep pool, known as the Blue Lagoon, by other children, jurors heard. Opening the Crown's case, prosecutor Mary Prior QC said Charlie was supervised near the water by strangers - including a man who was mistaken for his father - after being left alone. Mrs Prior told the court: ""No-one knows how it happened, no-one knows why it happened and at the time he died neither Miss Dunn or Mr Smith had any idea where he was. ""Charlie had been permitted to go off by himself. The prosecution say that Charlie died because he was not supervised by any adult."" The court heard Charlie was pulled from the water of a special children's pool at the park Mrs Prior added that the defendants had shown ""ingrained and entrenched indifference"" at the time of the tragedy. She also claimed they only saw Charlie during the two-hour period ""for the odd minute"" when he returned to their car for something to eat or drink. Mrs Prior said: ""This case is not about parents turning their back for a minute whilst a tragedy occurs. ""This is a gross failure to supervise not for seconds, and not for a few minutes, but for protracted periods of time in circumstances where the child was exposed to danger."" Charlie Dunn's family called him the Milkybar Kid The court also heard that a woman had told the couple in ""no uncertain terms that she was not happy that they were not supervising Charlie near to the water"" during a previous visit to the park. Both defendants are said to have replied that Charlie ""would be all right"". In 2015, a neighbour prevented the unsupervised toddler, then aged four, from driving a toy car on to a main road, the jury was told. Mr Smith, 36, and Ms Dunn, 28, of Caledonian, Glascote Heath, both deny causing the youngster's death by gross negligence by permitting him to enter a bathing area unsupervised. The trial continues.

"Hundreds of new drivers have been given automatic bans for using their mobile phones at the wheel, under tougher laws introduced this year. In March, the punishment for driving while on the phone was doubled to six penalty points - enough to ban those with less than two years experience. Figures obtained by Radio 5 live reveal 290 new UK drivers were disqualified in the first six months since the change. RAC road safety spokesman Pete Williams said the figures were sad to see. The new rules about phone use apply in England, Scotland and Wales. Drivers who get six points within two years of passing their test automatically lose their licence. To get back behind the wheel, they have to retake both the theory and practical parts of the driving test. The RAC's Mr Williams said: ""These people have spent hours and hours and hundreds of pounds learning to drive to gain their personal freedom only to throw it all away through this foolish behaviour. ""The only consolation is that they now won't be involved in some horrific crash caused by the distraction of a handheld mobile phone,"" he added. When the new penalties were introduced, Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said they would ""act as a strong deterrent"" to mobile phone users. However, the figures, released by the DVLA under the Freedom of Information Act suggest a total of 15,752 drivers received six penalty points for using a mobile phone between March and August. This is an increase from 15,237 drivers in the same period in 2016. Ben Carvin was 13 when his mother was killed when a lorry driver crashed into her car, while using a mobile phone, Ben said he was forced to grow up 10 years overnight. ""I went from being pretty carefree to feeling I had to be a secondary parent to my sister."" After hearing Ben speak on 5 Live Daily, Jerry, a lorry driver from north London admitted using his phone ""pretty regularly"" and said he would now stop. ""I was always looking at my phone, if I get a call from my boss I will answer that call."" ""I lost my own mother when I was 13."" He said after listening to Ben, he would now use his ""do not disturb"" app. National Police Chiefs' Council lead for roads policing, Chief Constable Anthony Bangham, said the police took the offence seriously. ""This is not a minor offence and is never a risk worth taking because a moment's distraction behind the wheel can change lives forever. ""Our message is simple - don't do it,"" he added.

"This video can not be played Prince Harry and Meghan Markle during their 2017 visit to Nottingham Meghan Markle has had a taste of royal life, as she joined her fiance Prince Harry on their first joint official public engagement in Nottingham. Excited crowds cheered as the couple greeted well-wishers ahead of a visit to a World Aids Day charity fair hosted by the Terrence Higgins Trust. They split up to talk to people lining both sides of their route and were given cards, flowers and chocolate. After the charity fair, they met head teachers at a nearby school. Well-wishers gathered in the city ahead of the visit to catch a glimpse of the couple, including Helena Bottomley, Zoe Scott and Carole Bingham, from East and West Bridgford. Ms Scott said: ""We love the royals. We are genuinely happy for Harry."" ""We all had our children at the same time as Diana [Princess of Wales] so we feel a real allegiance. She would be so thrilled,"" said Ms Bottomley. The couple announced their engagement on Monday and are due to marry at Windsor Castle in May. Crowds share Harry and Meghan's 'fairytale' moment How Meghan made her mark as a 'real deal' campaigner One of the people Prince Harry stopped to speak to was Julie Ball, 51, of Netherfield, who said the prince had commented on her Santa gloves. ""He said 'great gloves' and pulled one down over my fingers,"" she said. ""I said they're from Primark for Â£3. ""When Meghan walked past she said the same thing. She said, 'We have the same taste.'"" Harry and Meghan to wed at Windsor in May WATCH: Full interview with Prince Harry and Meghan Markle How will Meghan Markle become a British citizen? Another member of the public shouted to Prince Harry: ""How does it feel being a ginger with Meghan?"" ""It's great isn't it?"" The prince replied. Dickie Arbiter, former royal spokesman, told the BBC the couple took their time to talk to as many people as possible on their 30-minute walkabout. This video can not be played A card designed especially for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle has been given to them The couple's engagement was announced on Monday University of Nottingham students Raushana Nurzhubalina, from Kazakhstan, and Jenn Galandy, from Canada, set their alarms for 06:00 GMT to get a prime spot to try to see Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. ""It is such an honour to see the royals,"" Ms Nurzhubalina said. ""I'm also a fan of Suits, so it is a chance to see a star of that too."" Allow Twitter content?

Royal fan Irene Hardman had a goody bag ready to hand over to the couple, including copies of the local paper and two fridge magnets ""so they don't fight over it"". Speaking afterwards, the 81-year-old said: ""I cried - she's wonderful, and it's fantastic. They're so genuine."" By BBC royal correspondent, Sarah Campbell They are due to marry at Windsor Castle in May By the time the royal couple arrived, the pavements in the Lace Market were packed. Prince Harry and Meghan spent around half an hour meeting the people of Nottingham who had come out in force despite the cold. Meghan appeared very relaxed and perfectly at ease. This was her first official royal engagement with Harry and if she was nervous at all it did not show. She smiled, she chatted, at one point she even picked up someone's glove and handed it back to them. This was a confident first public appearance. The couple split up at points to cover both parts of the pavement and meet the maximum number of people. Meghan was happy to shake hands with the crowd and as she wasn't wearing gloves, the ring was on show. Tactile with her fiancÃ©e and the crowd - it's fair to say the response from the people was overwhelmingly positive. After the walkabout, Prince Harry and Ms Markle went to the Nottingham Contemporary Exhibition Centre for an event to mark World Aids Day. Dominic Edwards, from the Terrence Higgins Trust, told the BBC the charity was ""thrilled"" the couple had chosen to visit Nottingham, and said: ""I think it really underlines his great support for HIV as a cause."" Royal commentator Richard FitzWilliams, said this visit represented a link with the legacy of Princess Diana's influential work on HIV 30 years ago and was ""no coincidence"". Allow Twitter content?

Prince Harry has spent time in Nottingham both publicly and privately since he first met young people there in 2013, when he was exploring issues around youth violence. A year later, he established the Full Effect programme, which aims to stop youth violence in the city. At Nottingham Academy, the couple will watch a ""hip hopera"" and meet students. The handbag Ms Markle chose to carry on her Nottingham visit has already sold out. The bag was made by the Scottish label, Strathberry, which said ""it was a fantastic surprise"" to see the bride-to-be carrying one of its designs. Ms Markle was wrapped up in a long navy coat by Mackage - a brand also favoured by actresses Gwyneth Paltrow, Halle Berry, Eva Mendes and Blake Lively. She wore the coat over a beige cotton, full midi skirt from British-based fashion label Joseph, priced at Â£595, which also sold out on the brand's website. Who is Meghan Markle? Profile: Prince Harry On Tuesday, the couple's spokesman said Ms Markle would not be continuing her work on gender with the United Nations or with other organisations and instead would start new charity work as a full-time royal. Mr Knauf said she planned to focus her attention on the UK and Commonwealth. ""This is the country that's going to be her home now and that means travelling around, getting to know the towns and cities and smaller communities,"" he said. She will also become the fourth patron of the Royal Foundation of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry. The foundation is behind Prince Harry's Invictus Games - the Paralympic-style competition for injured servicemen and women and veterans - and also the mental health charity Heads Together. It has also been announced that Ms Markle intends to become a British citizen and will work towards it in the coming years.

"This video can not be played Family of crash victim backs release of CCTV footage The family of a grandmother who died in a hit-and-run crash has released CCTV of the moment she was killed in the hope of catching the driver. Krishna Devi Droch, 62, was hit by a silver Vauxhall Zafira travelling on the wrong side of the road in Handsworth, Birmingham, on 9 November. She died at the scene and the car was found burnt out two miles away. Three people arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving were released pending further inquiries. Darren Holness, 47, of Leonard Road, Handsworth, has been charged with perverting the course of justice. Ms Droch's brother Baldev Korotania said: ""The individuals responsible are still out there and the only closure for our family throughout this difficult period is for them to be brought to justice."" Midlands Live: Drowned five-year-old told to 'go off and play'; More time to question terror suspect The car hit Ms Droch as she crossed Rookery Road on her way to morning prayers. Moments earlier, it had sped through a red traffic light in Soho Road, and was being closely followed by a light green Corsa and a silver/grey Ford Mondeo. The family has backed the release of the CCTV footage by police All three cars - two of which had false plates - were found abandoned within 24 hours. Mr Korotania added: ""Krishna was the foundation of our family, who was always there when we needed her. ""Her caring and compassionate nature will forever be missed by us. ""The grandchildren she has left behind are still waiting for her to come home. ""Although nothing can replace what we have lost, her love and care will remain in our hearts forever."" Det Sgt Paul Hughes of West Midlands Police said: ""This tragic event has brought devastation and loss to a whole family and a larger community who knew and loved Krishna. ""We know that there were many people on Rookery Road that day, and there will be people we have not spoken to. ""I would appeal directly to them to come forward. The information you have may seem insignificant to you, but may be the piece of the puzzle we need to identify the occupants of the cars. ""I would urge those responsible to give themselves up before we come knocking at their door."" Det Sgt Paul Hughes appealed for anyone who recognised the Zafira's number plate to come forward Mr Holness is due at Birmingham Magistrates' Court on 12 December.

"Inspectors also found a backlog of 23,000 X-rays at the hospital A hospital failed to spot cases of lung cancer because it did not check patients' chest X-rays properly, the Care Quality Commission has found. The health watchdog found that three patients at Queen Alexandra Hospital in Portsmouth suffered ""significant harm"". It emerged that junior doctors complained they had been asked to carry out specialist radiology work without the appropriate training. The CQC has now launched a review of NHS radiology services in England. All NHS bodies have been instructed to provide details about their backlogs, turnaround times, staffing and arrangements for routine reporting of images. Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust said it had made an unreserved apology to the families of the three patients, two of whom have died. During their visit in July, CQC inspectors also found the hospital had a backlog of 23,000 chest X-rays. None of the 23,000 images from the preceding 12 months had been formally reviewed by a radiologist or appropriately-trained clinician. During the visit, inspectors learned some junior doctors had been given responsibility for reviewing the chest and abdomen X-rays. Prof Ted Baker, from the CQC, said ""When a patient is referred for an X-ray or scan, it is important that the resulting images are examined and reported on by properly trained clinical staff who know what they are looking for - this is a specialist skill."" Following the inspection, the trust has had to put in place steps to make sure images are examined and reported on by properly trained clinical staff. It was also tasked with providing a weekly report of the number of outstanding X-rays to the CQC and told it must notify those patients if their X-ray was held up. In August, the CQCrated the hospital's medical care ""inadequate"". Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust chief executive Mark Cubbon said: ""We have issued an unreserved apology to the families of the three patients who experienced harm because of the delays to their care. ""We have carried out a thorough review of the scans and X-rays reported so far; to date nearly 50% of the backlog has been cleared and we are in touch with any patients as necessary."" The trust has set up a free phone helpline - 0800 7837118 - for anyone who is concerned they may be affected. The hospital in Cosham has 975 beds and provides services to a local population of about 610,000 people.

"Hope of finding the ARA San Juan with surviving crew members has faded The Argentine navy says it has abandoned attempts to rescue 44 crew members on board a submarine that disappeared two weeks ago. ""Despite the magnitude of the efforts made, it has not been possible to locate the submarine,"" navy spokesman Enrique Balbi said on Thursday. The sub, the ARA San Juan, last made contact on Wednesday 15 November. Hopes of finding survivors faded after a suspected explosion was heard near its last-known location. Capt Balbi said the search for the submarine had been ""extended to more than double the number of days that determine the possibilities of rescuing the crew"". His comment refers to the estimated period that it is thought the crew could have survived in the submerged vessel. Enrique Balbi said that the ""phase has changed"" in the search for the missing sub Capt Balbi said that the navy was not able to confirm the fate of the crew, and no evidence of a shipwreck was found in the search area. He said that the search operation, involving numerous vessels and other submarines, was now a hunt for a wreck on the seabed in the area where the ARA San Juan is believed to have vanished. At the Mar Del Plata naval base, both relatives and naval colleagues of those missing broke down upon hearing the news, reported La NaciÃ³n newspaper, with doctors rushing to the aid of the most distraught. Many relatives urged authorities to continue searching vigorously. ""We want them to keep looking, to find the bodies, we need this to begin grieving,"" said Yolanda Mendiola, mother of Petty Officer Leandro Cisneros. The relatives of the sub's crew reacted to the news with sorrow, anger, suspicion - and some with enduring hope Some angrily accused authorities of allowing them to learn the news from the television, and of wanting to ""leave the kids lying in the middle of the sea"". Others held prayer groups and expressed hope that the crew might still be found alive. Some voiced suspicion. ""I want to know what happened and I do not believe in any of the official hypotheses,"" Luis Tagliapietra, whose son was on board, told the TN news channel. ""I have no words for it,"" she said. This video can not be played As hopes faded for the sub, angry relatives said the search operation had been inadequate The ARA San Juan was returning from a routine mission to Ushuaia, near the southernmost tip of South America, when it reported an ""electrical breakdown"". According to naval commander Gabriel Galeazzi, the submarine surfaced and reported what was described as a ""short circuit"" in the vessel's batteries. The sub was ordered to cut its mission short and return to the naval base in Mar del Plata immediately. The Argentine navy's last contact with the vessel was at approximately 07:30 (10:30 GMT) on 15 November, at which point its captain reportedly confirmed that the crew were well. What happens when a submarine vanishes Eight days after the sub vanished, the Vienna-based Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty Organisation said that it had detected a noise a few hours after the sub's last contact. The body, which operates a network of listening posts to monitor nuclear explosions, said that there had been a ""hydro-acoustic anomaly"" about 30 nautical miles (60km) north of the sub's last-known position at 10:31 (13:31 GMT). The Argentine navy said it could have been the sound of the submarine imploding. On Tuesday, Capt Balbi told reporters that water had entered the submarine's snorkel, which can be used to take in air from above the surface when the submarine is submerged. The saltwater dripped onto a battery tray in the prow, causing the battery to short circuit and to smoulder, he said. The sub had reported the fault and had been ordered back to base but then disappeared. The submarine, with its 44 crew, set off under the command of Pedro MartÃ­n FernÃ¡ndez. Forty-three of the crew were men but there was also one woman, Eliana MarÃ­a Krawczyk. The 35-year-old was the first female officer in Argentina to serve on a submarine. The rest of the crew were submariners of varying ages and experience. Who are the crew of missing Argentine submarine? The crew of the ARA San Juan comprises 43 men and one woman The sub's engineer, HernÃ¡n RodrÃ­guez, had been working with the ARA San Juan for 11 years. An international search mission has seen the deployment of 4,000 personnel from more than a dozen countries. Argentine President Mauricio Macri has ordered a probe into the sub's disappearance.

"Net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third to 230,000 in the year to June, new figures show. It is the first time that a full year of data has been available since the UK voted to leave the EU last June. The figure is still short of the Conservatives' target to reduce net migration to the ""tens of thousands"". Net migration is the difference between people coming to the UK for more than a year, and the number of people leaving the UK for a year or more. In this 12-month period, 572,000 people arrived in the UK, and 342,000 emigrated,the Office for National Statistics report,externalshowed. What's happening to migration? Immigration specifically fell by 80,000 people over the year - and three-quarters of that drop was down to fewer EU citizens coming to live in the UK, figures showed. Nicola White, head of migration statistics at the ONS, said: ""The decline follows historically high levels of immigration and it is too early to say whether this represents a long-term trend."" She pointed to figures showing the number of people coming to the UK for a definite job has remained stable but those coming to ""look for work"", especially EU citizens, was down 43%. ""These changes suggest that Brexit is likely to be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK - but decisions to migrate are complex and other factors are also going to be influencing the figures,"" she added. Immigration minister Brandon Lewis said the UK was still a country able to attract the ""brightest and the best"". With more Europeans continuing to arrive than leave, these figures showed that claims of a ""Brexodus"" were misguided, he said. He added that his focus was on making sure businesses have access to the skills needed from Europe and around the world; ensuring a controlled immigration system and making sure people were in the UK legally, being an important part of the economy and communities. The ONS said the 106,000 fall on the previous year's net migration figure was the largest annual decrease recorded. This was substantially down on its high of June 2016 and now at similar levels to 2014, the ONS said. The figures also showed: The number of non-EU citizens leaving the UK has remained stable over the past year - but the number of EU citizens, including British-born people - who have chosen to leave has increased by almost a third Applications by EU nationals to become British citizens were up by 80% BBC home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani said there was a combination of factors at play. ""Anecdotally you pick up the fears around the Brexit effect,"" he said. But the economic effects and the falling value of the pound might also be a factor, for example a Polish worker would get six zloty for every pound earned before Brexit. That's fallen by a quarter since the referendum, he added. Professor Jonathan Portes, of King's College, London, who works for the research group UK in a  Changing Europe, said the statistics showed the country has become a ""less attractive place for European migrants"". ""Whatever your views on the impact of immigration, it cannot be good news that the UK is a less attractive place to live and work, and that we will be poorer as a result,"" he said. Lord Green of Deddington, chairman of Migration Watch UK, said the figures showed a ""very welcome reduction in net migration - especially by EU citizens who do not have a job to come to"". ""It points to what could be achieved once the UK regains full control over migration,"" he added. The Conservatives' aim since 2010 has been to reduce net migration to below 100,000. The pledge to reduce net annual migration to the ""tens of thousands"" was in the 2010, 2015 and 2017 Tory manifestos. Neither Prime Minister Theresa May nor her predecessor, David Cameron, have come close to meeting that target. Brexit: What's happening to migration?
