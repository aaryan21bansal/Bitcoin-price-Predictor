"This video can not be played The crew called coastguards for assistance after sterilising and dressing the man's wounds A fisherman is in hospital after being bitten several times by a shark about 120 miles (197km) off Land's End. The porbeagle shark had been hauled up in the nets of the Govenek of Ladram fishing boat early on Sunday. The shark - thought to be up to 8ft (2.4m) long - bit the leg of fisherman Max Berryman as the crew tried to get it back in the water. He was treated at the scene and winched by the coastguard to Truro's Royal Cornwall Hospital. Max Berryman was winched from the boat and taken to hospital More on this story and others from Cornwall Alex Greig from Falmouth Coastguard said the shark bites went down to the muscle. ""There were about four to five cuts altogether, one of which was extending about 10in (25cm) in length along the side of his knee,"" he said. The Govenek of Ladram fishes out of Newlyn harbour in west Cornwall Phil Mitchell, the boat's skipper, said: ""His leg was badly gashed - I just had to do the best job I could dressing it. ""We got him stable and spoke to the doctor who recommended him being airlifted because of any bacteria that could have been on the teeth."" Mr Mitchell said he thought the shark weighed up to 20 stone (127kg). He described the porbeagle as ""really big and powerful"" and said it was fortunate the shark had caught Mr Berryman with its top jaw but did not clamp its bottom jaw closed.

Paramedic winchman Julian Williams was lowered to the vessel and praised the quick actions of the crew for treating the wounds. ""The crew had done a really good job of dressing the wounds before we arrived which meant that we were able to save time getting the casualty to hospital,"" he said.

"This video can not be played Watch: A man interrupts the UK's Eurovision entry in Lisbon SuRie has revealed she has some bruises on her hands after a man invaded the stage during her Eurovision performance on Saturday. The mangrabbed the microphonewhile the singer, representing the UK in the contest, was performing Storm. SuRie told ITV's This Morning: ""There's a couple of bruises from where I was holding the mic. But I'm OK."" She said she was also hurt on her shoulder from where the man had barged into her. ""There wasn't any time to feel fear,"" she said. ""He was suddenly there, security were on him as quick as he was on me, he got the mic for a few seconds, that was out of my hands, but the song was still going. SuRie was speaking on ITV's This Morning on Monday ""The backing vocalists were still singing, the crowd was still chanting, so I just turned upstage for a moment but I was still clapping and cheering with the crowd, I just didn't have the mic. ""I turned back and saw the mic on the floor, and I thought, 'well that's mine', I'll finish this song."" She added that the invasion gave her a new lease of life to finish the song. ""You can see it in my eyes for the last part of the song,"" SuRie told hosts Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby. ""You can see the determination to finish the song. ""As you say, the lyrics took on a new meaning - 'Hold your head up, don't give up' - and the crowd, the surge from then, that's my lasting memory from this."" The singer was offered the chance to perform the song again, but declined after discussing it with her team. ""We had that conversation, but I was really proud of that performance,"" she explained. ""And you work up to that moment. ""You don't get to do the 100m sprint at the Olympics again because your shoelace is untied or something. You had that one shot and that was my moment, and we didn't need to repeat that. ""We had those conversations backstage, I saw the reaction and faces of my team, who were very proud of the recovery and the power of that, and we didn't need to go again."" Schofield commented he was expecting the singer to benefit from a ""sympathy vote"" after her performance was interrupted, adding he was surprised she finished 24th out of 26. ""I don't need the sympathy vote,"" SuRie replied. ""The point of the Eurovision Song Contest is it began a few years after World War Two when everyone's reeling from grief and sadness and fear, and they bring nations together to sing their way out of it. ""It's such an amazing thing to be a part of, it really is. And my leaderboard for the night is the Twitter feed, the Instagram feed that I've had, with the love and support from so many people.

"The Oratory School says it condemns racist imagery and has apologised A boarding school has apologised after a group of boys ""blacked up"" and dressed as slaves for a photograph. Sixth-formers at the Oratory School in Oxfordshire, wore the make-up and costumes for their leaving pictures, which were published on social media. The pupils were stopped from taking part in an ""informal"" photo shoot, but took their own picture, which was posted online. The school has apologised ""unreservedly"". ""The pupils involved have been punished as part of our disciplinary process. ""We will strengthen our tutorial programme to ensure that it is understood by all our pupils that such representations are utterly unacceptable,"" a spokesman said. The school, which has fees of over Â£11,000 per term, told the BBC it takes a formal leavers' photo of its sixth-form students. It also takes an informal photo, where pupils dress up in costumes. A group of the boys had created ""a tableau of a slave gang, with the white boys dressed as black slaves and the black boys as white slave owners"". The images were condemned on social media. The headmaster and senior staff were present when the group tried to join the formal photo.

""The photo - the existence of which we were unaware - that was taken and posted on social media was taken unofficially and was in no way with the consent or blessing of the school."" The school said it was ""extremely shocked and saddened"" about the incident and apologised ""unreservedly for the offence caused"".

"This video can not be played Gaza's deadliest day of violence in years At least 52 Palestinians have been killed and 2,400 wounded by Israeli troops, Palestinian officials say, on the deadliest day of violence since the 2014 Gaza war. Palestinians have been protesting for weeks but deaths soared on the day the US opened its embassy in Jerusalem. Palestinians see this as clear US backing for Israeli rule over the whole city, whose eastern part they claim. But US President Donald Trump hailed the move in a video message. He told the dedication ceremony that it had been a ""long time coming"", adding: ""Israel is a sovereign nation with the right to determine its own capital but for many years we failed to acknowledge the obvious."" The day's events as they happened What makes Jerusalem so holy? The US, he added, remained ""committed to facilitating a lasting peace agreement"". There have been six weeks of protests at the Gaza border, dubbed the ""Great March of Return"" and led by Gaza's Islamist rulers Hamas. Hamas had always said it would step up the protests before Tuesday, when Palestinians hold their annual commemoration of what they call theNakbaor Catastrophe. Hundreds of thousands fled their homes or were displaced following the foundation of the Israeli state on 14 May 1948. Hundreds of people have been injured, according to Palestinian officials On Monday, the Israeli military said 40,000 Palestinians had taken part in ""violent riots"" at 13 locations along the Gaza Strip security fence. Palestinians hurled stones and incendiary devices while the Israeli military used snipers, as black smoke poured from burning tyres. The health ministry, run by Hamas, said children were among those killed. The Israeli military said it had killed three people trying to plant explosives near the security fence in Rafah. Aircraft and tanks had also targeted military positions belonging to Hamas in the northern Gaza Strip, it said. Israel says the protests are aimed at breaching the border and attacking Israeli communities nearby. There were also violent clashes between Israeli police and protesters who raised Palestinian flags outside the new embassy. Several protesters were detained. Feras Kilani, BBC Arabic, at the protests in Gaza Tuesday is expected to be a very big demonstration because it is a day known by the Palestinians as the ""Catastrophe"" that followed the creation of the state of Israel. Palestinians will go to bury the dozens of people killed on Monday and then they will come again to demonstrate. You can imagine the situation with all this anger, thousands of Palestinians will come here and will try to cross the fence to return to what they see as their land - what they do not see as Israel but as Palestine. It is expected to be bigger than Monday and more bloody. Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas condemned what he called Israeli ""massacres against our people"", and declared three days of mourning. Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu said: ""Every nation has the right to defend its borders. Hamas clearly says its intentions are to destroy Israel and sends thousands to break through the border for that end."" A number of Western nations including the UK called for restraint. EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said: ""We expect all to act with utmost restraint to avoid further loss of life"" Germany said Israel had the right to defend itself but should do so proportionately One of the strongest statements came from UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, who condemned the ""shocking killing of dozens, injury of hundreds by Israeli live fire"" Allow Twitter content?

A small interim embassy will start operating from Monday inside the existing US consulate building in Jerusalem. A larger site will be found later when the rest of the embassy moves from Tel Aviv. This video can not be played Donald Trump addresses the ceremony via videolink The opening ceremony was brought forward to coincide with the state of Israel's 70th anniversary. Mr Trump's daughter, Ivanka, and her husband Jared Kushner, who are both senior White House advisers, joined US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan for the ceremony. How did the world react to embassy move? Five key takeaways from Jerusalem decision After Ivanka Trump had unveiled the seal of the embassy, Mr Kushner said in his address: ""When President Trump makes a promise he keeps it... We have shown the world that the US can be trusted. We stand with our friends and allies."" Mr Kushner also referred to Mr Trump's withdrawal from the ""dangerous, flawed and one-sided Iran deal"", drawing applause from the guests. Mr Netanyahu said: ""What a glorious day. Remember this moment. This is history. President Trump, by recognising history, you have made history. All of us are deeply grateful."" Mahmoud Abbas condemned the embassy as a ""settlement in East Jerusalem"", saying that the US was ""no longer a mediator in the Middle East"". Arab League chief Ahmed Abul Gheit said it was ""shameful to see countries participating with the US and Israel in celebrating the former's embassy move to occupied Jerusalem in a clear and grave violation of international law"". The status of Jerusalem goes to the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Can the settlement issue be solved? The alternatives to a two-state solution Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem is not recognised internationally and, according to the 1993 Israel-Palestinian peace accords, the final status of Jerusalem is meant to be discussed in the latter stages of peace talks. Israel has occupied East Jerusalem since the 1967 Middle East war. It effectively annexed the sector, though this was not recognised by any countries until Mr Trump's declaration in December 2017. This video can not be played Why the ancient city of Jerusalem is so important Since 1967, Israel has built a dozen settlements, home to about 200,000 Jews, in East Jerusalem. These are considered illegal under international law, although Israel disputes this. Why do evangelicals support Trump on Jerusalem? Various countries once had embassies based in Jerusalem but many moved after Israel passed a law in 1980 formally making Jerusalem its capital. Why Jerusalem matters.

"This video can not be played Gaza's deadliest day of violence in years Funerals were held on Tuesday in Gaza for 58 Palestinians reported killed on Monday when Israeli troops opened fire during protests, in the deadliest day of violence there since a war in 2014. Another death was reported on Tuesday - a 51-year-old man - but calm mostly prevailed as the dead were buried. Israel has faced international condemnation over the deaths, from the UN, UK, France, Russia and others. Israel has defended its actions, and the US has voiced its support. Monday's violence came as the US inaugurated its first embassy in Jerusalem, a controversial step by the Trump administration that broke with decades of US policy and incensed Palestinians. Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state. Many see the US move as backing Israeli control over the whole of the city, which Israel regards as its indivisible capital. 'Hear our message': Gaza border violence in pictures Life in the Gaza Strip Analysis: The real reasons behind Trump's embassy move Donald Trump's decision to relocate the embassy, announced in December, fuelled anger in Islamist-ruled Gaza, which is economically impoverished and under an Israeli and Egyptian blockade. Israel and Egypt say it is for their self-defence. For seven weeks, protesters have gathered on the Gaza side of the border with Israel, with scores of deaths over that period before the violence ratcheted this week. Among the dead on Monday were eight children under the age of 16, including a baby of eight months, Layila al-Ghandour, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. At least 2,700 were reported injured. No Israelis were reported killed or injured. Palestinian relatives mourn during the funeral of eight-month-old Layila al-Ghandour Many of the dead and wounded in Gaza were hit by sniper-fire, the health ministry said. Israeli troops opened fire as protesters pushed towards the border fence that separates the Gaza Strip from Israel. Israel said its soldiers fired only at ""targets of terrorist activity"". UN human rights spokesman Rupert Colville told reporters in Geneva on Tuesday that Israel's use of force was ""not acceptable"". ""The mere fact of approaching a fence is not a lethal, life-threatening act, so that does not warrant being shot,"" he said. ""It seems that anyone is liable to be shot dead,"" he added, stressing that international law makes it clear that ""lethal force may only be used as a measure of last, not first, resort."" A Palestinian protester launches a stone from a catapult during Monday's protests The majority of the wounded were shot in their lower limbs, Mahmoud Daher, an official at the World Health Organisation (WHO), told the Associated Press. Israeli media has previously reported that troops at the border are instructed to first issue warning shots, then fire at protesters' legs. Funerals began on Tuesday for some of the 58 people killed, coinciding with the day Palestinians call the ""Nakba"", or ""catastrophe"", which commemorates more than 700,000 Palestinians who fled or were expelled from their homes in the 1948-49 war surrounding Israel's creation. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the country's military was acting in self-defence against Gaza's Islamist rulers, Hamas. ""Every country has an obligation to defend its borders,"" he said. Palestinian Nakba explained in 100 and 300 words What makes Jerusalem so holy? What is Hamas? The Israeli military said some 40,000 Palestinians had taken part in ""violent riots"" at 13 locations along Israel's security fence on Gaza's eastern border on Monday. It said ""at least 24 terrorists with documented terror background"" were among those killed. Demonstrations have been taking place at the border fence for the past seven weeks, as part of a protest branded the ""Great March of Return"". Palestinian protesters have hurled stones and incendiary devices and approached the border fence, which Israel has declared a no-go zone, on foot. Israel's return fire has killed more than 100 people in that period and injured thousands. By Jeremy Bowen, BBC Middle East Editor, in Gaza City This video can not be played Jeremy Bowen explains why people have been protesting in Gaza At Shifa, Gaza's main hospital, men were queuing on Tuesday to give blood. They wanted to help the many wounded in Monday's violence. Inside the hospital, there were many with gunshot wounds. Across Gaza, families were burying their dead. By midday there were no reports of new demonstrations. There was shock in Gaza at the scale of the killing. The right of return to lands they lost is a highly emotional issue for Palestinians but people here questioned whether it was worth staging such a protest after the terrible death toll. In fact, this was an incident waiting to happen. Tension has been rising for weeks in Gaza. People here have been impoverished by a goods blockade imposed by Israel and by Egypt, which shuns Hamas because of its links with the Muslim Brotherhood. The only way of stopping more violence and death is to work seriously to settle the conflict. But that is not happening. Can settlement issue be solved?

Ms Markle and her mother Doria Ragland will stay at the Cliveden House Hotel, about nine miles north of Windsor Castle, the venue for her big day. The prince will stay at the Dorchester Collection's Coworth Park in Ascot, with his brother and best man, the Duke of Cambridge. The details were released five days before Saturday's wedding.

Cliveden was linked to a 1960s political scandal -the Profumo affair- as it was where war minister John Profumo first met Christine Keeler and started a relationship. Cliveden House is surrounded by 376 acres of National Trust grounds The privately owned stately home was built in 1666 by the 2nd Duke of Buckingham as a gift to his mistress.

"A 26-year-old man died in hospital in the Sri Lankan capital Colombo A British amateur rugby player has died and a team mate is critically ill after complaining of breathing difficulties on returning from a nightclub in Sri Lanka. The pair had been touring the country with Durham-based Clems Pirates RFC when they visited the club in Colombo. Thomas Howard, 25 from Durham, died shortly after being admitted to hospital on Sunday. Tom Baty, 26, also from Durham, remains in hospital. Durham City Rugby Football Club, which oversees the team, confirmed Mr Howard had died after ""suffering breathing problems"" and that Mr Baty was still receiving treatment. The team arrived in Sri Lanka on Wednesday and began the tour with a game against Ceylonese Rugby and Football Club (CR & FC) in Colombo. According to police in Sri Lanka, some British players went to a nightclub after the match and returned to their hotel in the early hours of Sunday. The two players complained of breathing difficulties to the hotel management at about 10:00 on Sunday. Police said a post-mortem examination would be carried out later. A police spokesman told the BBC: ""Both men had returned from a nightclub and had complained of breathing difficulties, and they were admitted to the hospital, one died and another is in very critical condition."" Durham City Rugby Club said in a statement the pair suffered ""non-rugby related breathing problems"". ""Subsequently, one of the two has died and one remains in hospital,"" the statement said. Sri Lanka Rugby Football Union director Rohan Gunerathne said the organisation was looking into the matter, but confirmed nothing happened on the rugby pitch during the match. A British High Commission spokesman in Colombo said both families were being supported, and they were in contact with the Sri Lankan medical services. A spokeswoman for the Foreign Office said: ""Our staff are supporting the family of a British man following his death in Sri Lanka, and are in contact with the Sri Lankan hospital services. ""We are assisting the family of a British man who has been hospitalised in Sri Lanka, and are in contact with the Sri Lankan medical services."" Durham County councillor Dr David Boyes said Durham City RFC was a very well organised, well equipped organisation and oversaw a number of teams. Dr Boyes added that the club had organised numerous tours abroad in the past and had never had any problems before. ""I really feel for the families, being that far away and knowing that a family member has died must be terrible,"" he said. Clem's Pirates tours regularly across Europe and further afield. It is a well known club in the area especially for its fundraising efforts and tours. Fellow Durham County councillor Richard Ormerod said it was ""very sad news"" for all those involved. ""My thoughts are with the families and friends and team mates. ""They do a lot of good work raising money for charity and introducing people to rugby.""

"Ms Musenga called the emergency services complaining of a severe stomach ache An emergency services operator has said she is not to blame after she mocked a young mother who died hours after calling the service in acute distress. Naomi Musenga, 22, called Strasbourg's ambulance service with severe stomach pain and said: ""I'm going to die"". ""You'll definitely die one day, like everyone else,"" the operator replied. The woman - who wishes to remain anonymous - told French TV on Sunday night that she was under pressure and the emergency services were overworked. Asked if she regretted what she had said, the operator replied: ""In the conditions... let's say it was inappropriate. ""We are constantly under pressure... I can be two or three hours hanging on my phone, I have no time to get up there's so much [demand] everywhere,"" she said. ""We hang up and we pick up."" She said some of her colleagues working in the medical emergency services had received threats since news of Musenga's death had emerged. Naomi Musenga's family has called for appeasement over the death of their daughter Musenga's family have refused to blame the operator, saying they recognise her poor working conditions, France's BFMTV reported. The operator's lawyer told BFMTV last week said that she would normally field on average 2,000 calls a day. ""When... you hear: 'I have a stomach ache'... it is true that the first reflex is to think that there is no absolute emergency and that one has to go and see their GP,"" the lawyer said. The head of France's association of emergency doctors said last week that the number of ambulance emergencies had mushroomed from eight million in 1988 to 21 million today, while the number of calls had trebled. Strasbourg's hospital said that on the day of the call, the operator had just returned from being on leave for two weeks and had begun her day at 07:30 that day. Ms Musenga called four hours later, at 11:30. On front line with ambulance service How a speedy emergency services app is saving lives In the three-minute call, Musenga - in a very weak voice - appealed for help and struggled to describe her pain while speaking with the ambulance service, Samu. The operator, sounding annoyed, replied: ""If you don't tell me what's going on, I'll hang up!"" The operator eventually called SOS MÃ©decins, which sends out doctors instead of an ambulance, and, after a five-hour wait, Musenga was taken to hospital by the ambulance service. She suffered a stroke at the hospital and was transferred to the intensive care unit, but later died of multiple organ failure. The case dates back to December, but only came to light when a recording of the call, obtained by the victim's family, waspublished by a local website.,external The operator, who had worked for the Samu for four years and as an ambulance worker for 20, according to the Le Parisien newspaper, has been suspended, and the authorities have opened an investigation. A spokesman for the French government said authorities were looking at speeding up promised moves towards a single emergency number, after Ms Musenga called the wrong one when seeking help.

"Customers had to queue for up to an hour to get a single slice of pizza after a broken oven slowed the flow of food. Organisers of an all-you-can-eat pizza festival have apologised after repeatedly running out of pizza slices. Customershad to queue for up to an hour,externalto get a single slice of pizza after an oven broke at the Notting Hill Pizza Festival on Saturday. Guests were promised ""the opportunity to sample unlimited amounts of pizza"" by organisers Bellmonte Life. The ""high-end luxury lifestyle brand"" blamed ""overzealous appetites"" as well as the broken oven for slow service. Tim Swabey said he waited 30 minutes for a pizza that ""looked like something that had already passed through a cat's digestive system"" The firm said: ""Despite the best efforts of our team preparing the pizzas in the smaller ovens, the flow of pizzas was slower than intended. ""In contrast to claims that there were not enough pizzas, this was not the case. Our team was hard at work to ensure that everyone was able to sample pizzas. ""However, it was unfortunate that the queues grew due to some overzealous appetites, preventing others to be able to enjoy the food."" The event promised a ""pizza for every palate"" at the Porchester Hall, in west London. Alex White, 28, said she abandoned the festival to go to a pizza restaurant having only eaten two slices in one-and-a-half hours. ""I'm definitely annoyed, it was clearly very badly thought through,"" said Ms White. Customers reported queuing for up to an hour to get a single slice of pizza at Porchester Hall, in Notting Hill Tim Swabey, 24, said: ""When we arrived at the festival we were immediately surprised by the long queues for pizza at each stall. When pizza did arrive it ""looked like something that had already passed through a cat's digestive system"", Mr Swabey added. Festival-goers were given complimentary drinks when it became clear pizzas were not reaching everyone. Bellmonte Life has offered pizza festival ticket-holders complimentary VIP passes for an upcoming barbecue festival in July.

"In 1975, Xia Boyu handed his sleeping bag to a suffering teammate - and lost both feet to frostbite A Chinese climber who was crippled by frostbite on Everest more than 40 years ago has scaled the summit at the start of this year's climbing season. In 1975, Xia Boyu lost his feet after giving his sleeping bag to a sick teammate during a high-altitude storm. Now aged 69, he became the second double amputee to scale Everest - and the first ever from the Nepalese side. Australian Steve Plain, meanwhile, set the record for the fastest climb of the highest mountains on seven continents. Plain's achievement also features a story of overcoming physical challenge, coming four years after he broke his neck in a surfing accident. The storm that caused Xia's frostbite struck in the ""death zone"" above 8,000m (26,200ft) and stranded his team for three nights, not far from the summit. As a result, he needed to have his feet amputated. Then, in 1996, his legs were amputated above the knee as he battled lymphoma. Despite his injuries, he never abandoned the notion of reaching the summit. ""Climbing Mount Everest is my dream,"" he told AFP news agency in April. ""I have to realise it. It also represents a personal challenge, a challenge of fate."" Allow Facebook content? This article contains content provided by Facebook.

After the disastrous 1975 climb, he made three more attempts, in 2014, 2015 and 2016. The 2016 attempt brought him close to the summit before a blizzard set in. However, a ban on climbers like Xia almost ended his attempts. Nepalese authorities moved last year to ban double amputees- along with blind and solo climbers - from attempting to reach the summit. The authorities said the new rules were a safety measure but they were struck down by the courts earlier this year as discriminatory. Sherpa to make record 22nd Everest bid Everest clean-up campaign begins On Monday, supported by a team of Sherpa guides, Xia reached the summit in what the Himalayan Times says is the first successful double amputee climb from the Nepal side. It also makes him only the second double-amputee to ever reach the summit of the world's highest mountain.Mark Inglis, of New Zealand, became the first when he reached the summit in 2006,external. Inglis also lost his limbs to frostbite in a climbing accident, after spending two weeks in an ice cave sheltering from a mountain storm. Steve Plain also took advantage of the first day possible to reach the summit, setting his four-month speed record for the seven continents. Both Plain and Xia's teams had already begun their climb when Sherpa guides affixed ropes to the summit, opening the final leg of the route for the climbing season. That meant that Plain could reach his seventh mountain peak on his seventh continent in just 117 days - shaving nine days off the previous record. Allow YouTube content?

The seven summits Mr Plain scaled are, in order of completion: Vinson, Antarctica(4,892m/16,066ft) Aconcagua, South America,(6,962m/22,840ft) Kilimanjaro, Africa(5895m/19,340ft) Carstensz Pyramid, Australasia(4884m/16,020ft) Elbrus, Europe(5642m/18,510 ft) Denali, North America(6,190m/20,310ft) Everest, Asia(8,848m/29,030ft) Plain was surfing in Western Australia in the summer of 2014 when a wave dumped him, head first, into the sand. He suffered a broken neck or ""hangman's fracture"" and said doctors had told him they were not sure if he would ever walk again. ""Three and a half years ago I was lying in hospital with a broken neck and at that time set myself the goal,"" he wrote on Facebook after reaching the summit. Plain has also been using his record attempt to raise money for charities the  Surf Life Saving Association and SpinalCure Australia - two groups he has close associations with after his own injuries.

From a low-key start in the 1960s, it became notorious, embracing that image with risquÃ© advertising slogans. Now, Thomas Cook, which took over the brand in 1998, says it is considering its future, including a possible sale. It wants to concentrate on its Cook's Club brand, which it launched last month and which it believes is of more appeal to its millennial customers. The concept is centred on its own-brand hotels, which can accommodate 300-400 guests and features such attractions as poolside DJs and a sharper focus on food for, a spokesman told the BBC, the ""Instagram generation"". Have millennials killed off Club 18-30? Club 18-30 was founded in the 1960s to offer package holidays targeted at young singles and couples to travel without families or children. The first destination was Lloret de Mar on the Costa Brava. In 1973, it was bought out by the management, the first of a series of changes of ownership. Its controversial, playful image kept it in the public eye throughout the 1990s and 2000s. Advertising slogans from the time included  ""It's not all sex, sex, sex. There's a bit of sun and sea as well"". Young, impressionable and on my first package holiday I chose a last-minute 18-30 with friends to Corfu. We'd worked all summer to pay for the trip and a week in the sun with plenty of fun sounded ideal. The reps were all focused on making sure you had ""fun""'. That meant lots of bars, clubs, free drinks and games. I was terrified. But somehow managed to maintain the participation level to end up in the final of a game where the girls had to move an egg up the inside of a bloke's trousers and then down the other side. Only one of the eggs was hard boiled. We lost, and I never took another 18-30. ""While Club 18-30 is easily the most-recognised brand in this sector, it is a tired and tarnished brand - people who went on its first holidays in the 1970s are now in their 70s!,"" said Simon Calder, travel editor at the Independent. ""'Hosting the wildest party holidays' (one of its marketing slogans) from Magaluf to Bulgaria is no longer especially popular with local authorities, who are cracking down on organised bar crawls. ""Thomas Cook is moving steadily upmarket, ditching cheap and nasty accommodation in favour of sophisticated all-inclusive properties."" In 2002, ITV made the programme Club Reps, based on the life of the workers. Full of salacious details, it is said to have boosted bookings significantly. In 2005, Channel 5 showed a documentary called the Curse of Club 18-30. The company was not amused and complained to Ofcom. Although it is called Club 18-30, the actual target age range is 17-35.

"A Montana funeral home says the actress died at her home on Sunday Actress Margot Kidder, best known for her role as Lois Lane in Superman, has died aged 69. A funeral home in Livingston, Montana, where the actress lived, said Kidder died at her home on Sunday. She rose to fame starring alongside Christopher Reeve in the Superman films of the 1970s and 1980s. The Canadian-born actress acquired American citizenship in 2005, and became a political and women's rights activist alongside her acting. The cause of her death is not yet known. Kidder starred alongside Reeve in the 1978 film Superman and its sequels, as well as horror classics Black Christmas and The Amityville Horror. The actress was also an outspoken critic of the Gulf War, of fracking by energy companies, and was at times a vocal supporter of Democratic party candidates. After settling in the US state of Montana, she became a supporter of Montana Women For, a non-profit organisation which describes its goals as the ""participation and empowerment of women in our democracy through education and advocacy on critical issues"". As an activist, she was arrested in 2011 while taking part in a protest at the White House againstthe Keystone XL pipeline, which remains controversial today. Kidder also suffered from mental health problems, which resulted in her high-profile disappearance for several days in 1996. Kidder, seen here in 2009, continued to work alongside her activism In an interview with People magazine later that year,external, she referred to her disappearance as ""the most public freak-out in history"". While working on her memoirs, a computer virus destroyed all of her work, she told the magazine - something she concluded was deliberate, and involved her former husband and the CIA. She was eventually found safe, and would talk openly about her experience of manic episodes and of depression in the years ahead, raising awareness about bipolar disorder while advocating the use of alternative medicine as a treatment. On social media, film and superhero fans paid tribute to the actress. DC Comics, publisher of the Superman comic books, said Kidder was ""the Lois Lane so many of us grew up with"". Eric Goldman, editor at rival comic book maker Marvel, said Kidder ""made sure my generation knew just how awesome Lois Lane was"" - a sentiment echoed by famed comic book writer Mark Millar, who said she was ""my Lois Lane"". Teri Hatcher, who played Lois Lane in the 1990s TV show Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman, wrote that it had been ""a privilege"" to step into Kidder's role - while her co-starDean Cain also tweeted his condolences,external.

"Jeremy Hunt has warned Boris Johnson his public criticism could undermine the UK's Brexit negotiating position. The health secretary told BBC Radio 4's Today he thought ""it's important that we have these debates in private"". The UK government is currently deciding which form of future trade relations it wants with the EU before the detailed negotiations take place in Brussels. The foreign secretary called one of the two options - a customs partnership - ""crazy"", in a newspaper interview. UK needs Brexit 'safe harbour' - Miliband Johnson: No 10's customs plans 'crazy' Reality Check: The government's customs options Mr Hunt told Today: ""I do think that it is important that we have these debates in private. Not just because of collective responsibility, which is what democracy depends on, but also because this is a negotiation. On the EU side, if they see divisions in the open, they will exploit that. ""I actually think he has a very important role to play in the Government and he is the architect of the whole Brexit campaign and we are listening to what he says and we are doing what he wants. ""But I think we have to recognise that we are not the only people who read the papers in Britain - they are read across the world - and we need to give Theresa May some space. ""If we are going to have these lively debates, we should have them in private because that will strengthen Theresa May's negotiating hand."" Asked if his message would be ""Boris belt up"", Mr Hunt replied to the interviewer: ""You could say that - I would say he's a marvellous foreign secretary but let's work as a team."" A 'highly streamlined' customs arrangement - This would minimise customs checks rather than getting rid of them altogether, using new technologies and things like trusted trader schemes, which could allow companies to pay duties in bulk every few months rather than every time their goods crossed a border A customs partnership - This would remove the need for new customs checks at the border. The UK would collect tariffs set by the EU customs union on goods coming into the UK. If those goods didn't leave the UK and UK tariffs on them were lower, companies could then claim back the difference. The UK is committed to leaving the current customs union when it exits the EU on 29 March 2019 and ministers are under pressure to agree soon on a successor arrangement amid divisions in cabinet. Downing Street has proposed two options but leading Brexiteers in the cabinet, including Boris Johnson and Michael Gove, have been openly sceptical of the customs partnership, believed to be the PM's preferred option. Writing in the Sunday Times, Mrs May promised a solution,externalwhich ensured frictionless trade, enabled the UK to strike trade deals around the world and which did not result in a hard border on the island of Ireland. Boris Johnson said the UK must have an ""unimpeded"" trade policy after Brexit Speaking after meeting his French counterpart in London, Mr Johnson said he agreed with Mrs May, saying ""we think that is possible, she thinks that is possible, so that is the way forward"". But French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said the time was approaching for the UK to make up its mind. ""I think it is essential that at the (EU summit) meeting in June there should be important progress,"" he said. ""There was an agreement in principle with regards to withdrawal but it hasn't been completed and now we have to go to definitive decisions, and the responsibility for those is with the British side."" As debate continues over which type of trade deal the UK wants with the EU post-Brexit, Mrs May is holding three meetings with large groups of Conservative MPs in Downing Street. Assistant political editor Norman Smith described it as a ""factual"" presentation of the customs options rather than making the case for either of the two. Reality Check: Why is the customs union so important? MSPs urged to reject EU Withdrawal Bill DUP MP hits out at Irish foreign minister He said those invited - including former ministers Priti Patel, Damian Green, Grant Shapps, Cheryl Gillan and Maria Miller - were told that neither models would work ""in their current form"". Mr Shapps, who called for Mrs May to consider her position last year, told the BBC he welcomed No 10's ""genuine attempts"" to keep MPs informed and not to railroad them in supporting one particular route. ""It was very much 'here are the advantages and disadvantages of one and the other and you can now see what we are having to deal with',"" he said. Damian Green, the former first secretary of state, said he expected a revised version of the alternative ""maximum facilitation"" model - which would use technology to ensure the smooth flow of goods at the border - would eventually prevail, although he questioned whether this would be up and running in time. ""It seems to me overwhelmingly likely that we will and should end up with some kind of compromise,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour.

"Michel Barnier is leading the negotiations for the EU side Brexit talks have made ""little"" progress since March, the EU's chief negotiator has said. Michel Barnier said there was a ""risk of failure"" in two key areas - Northern Ireland, and how the agreement will be governed. He said June's EU summit was a ""key rendezvous"" to reach a deal that can be ratified before the UK leaves. And he defended the EU's stance over the UK's involvement in the new Galileo sat-nav system. UK reveals proposed EU security deal UK needs Brexit 'safe harbour' - Miliband Can the UK really go it alone with a new sat-nav scheme? The UK has played a key role in the programme's development so far, but faces being shut out of key elements of the programme after Brexit. UK ministers are now considering setting up a rival version. Mr Barnier said there had been ""misunderstandings"" in the coverage of the story, adding: ""We are not kicking the UK out of Galileo. The UK decided unilaterally and autonomously to withdraw from the EU. This implies leaving its programmes as well."" EU rules mean the UK and its companies cannot participate in the ""development of security sensitive matters"", he said, adding that this did not mean the UK could not use an encrypted signal from the system as a third country. Earlier Science Minister Sam Gyimah said the EU's position was ""extremely disappointing"". ""The EU is playing hard ball with us,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""We have helped to develop the Galileo system. We want to be part of the secure elements of the system and we want UK industry to be able to bid for contracts on a fair basis. ""It is only on those terms that it makes sense for the UK to be involved in the project."" Mr Barnier was speaking after updating the remaining EU member states on the latest in the Brexit negotiations. Asked about the progress that had been made since March, he said: ""I would say little, not very little."" He said the transition period that is expected to follow Brexit day in March 2019 depended on ""operational solutions"" being found on the issue of Northern Ireland's border with the Republic. ""The clock is ticking"" to reach an agreement before October or November which can be ratified by the UK and European Parliaments and the EU Council, he said. ""So, little progress but we are working on technical issues which is always useful. ""None of these issues are negligible. The two key points which remain, where there is risk of failure, are the governance of the agreement and the  Ireland-Northern Ireland issue."" The UK government has yet to settle on the model it wants to replace the customs union in order to avoid checks at Northern Ireland's border with the EU. Prime Minister Theresa May met Conservative MPs at Downing Street to set out thegovernment's two proposals. Earlier Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has described one, a customs partnership, as ""crazy"" - to keep discussions private. What are the UK's two customs proposals? ""On the EU side, if they see divisions in the open, they will exploit that,"" Mr Hunt said. At a press conference with his French counterpart, Mr Johnson was asked why he had not resigned given his differences with the prime minister -  but he did not repeat his criticism of the partnership option and said he thought Mrs May's position was ""completely right"". Mrs May's key Brexit committee of senior ministers - which is divided over the customs issue - meets again on Tuesday.

"This video can not be played Watch: A man interrupts the UK's Eurovision entry in Lisbon SuRie has revealed she has some bruises on her hands after a man invaded the stage during her Eurovision performance on Saturday. The mangrabbed the microphonewhile the singer, representing the UK in the contest, was performing Storm. SuRie told ITV's This Morning: ""There's a couple of bruises from where I was holding the mic. But I'm OK."" She said she was also hurt on her shoulder from where the man had barged into her. ""There wasn't any time to feel fear,"" she said. ""He was suddenly there, security were on him as quick as he was on me, he got the mic for a few seconds, that was out of my hands, but the song was still going. SuRie was speaking on ITV's This Morning on Monday ""The backing vocalists were still singing, the crowd was still chanting, so I just turned upstage for a moment but I was still clapping and cheering with the crowd, I just didn't have the mic. ""I turned back and saw the mic on the floor, and I thought, 'well that's mine', I'll finish this song."" She added that the invasion gave her a new lease of life to finish the song. ""You can see it in my eyes for the last part of the song,"" SuRie told hosts Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby. ""You can see the determination to finish the song. ""As you say, the lyrics took on a new meaning - 'Hold your head up, don't give up' - and the crowd, the surge from then, that's my lasting memory from this."" The singer was offered the chance to perform the song again, but declined after discussing it with her team. ""We had that conversation, but I was really proud of that performance,"" she explained. ""And you work up to that moment. ""You don't get to do the 100m sprint at the Olympics again because your shoelace is untied or something. You had that one shot and that was my moment, and we didn't need to repeat that. ""We had those conversations backstage, I saw the reaction and faces of my team, who were very proud of the recovery and the power of that, and we didn't need to go again."" Schofield commented he was expecting the singer to benefit from a ""sympathy vote"" after her performance was interrupted, adding he was surprised she finished 24th out of 26. ""I don't need the sympathy vote,"" SuRie replied. ""The point of the Eurovision Song Contest is it began a few years after World War Two when everyone's reeling from grief and sadness and fear, and they bring nations together to sing their way out of it. ""It's such an amazing thing to be a part of, it really is. And my leaderboard for the night is the Twitter feed, the Instagram feed that I've had, with the love and support from so many people.

"Ms Musenga called the emergency services complaining of a severe stomach ache An emergency services operator has said she is not to blame after she mocked a young mother who died hours after calling the service in acute distress. Naomi Musenga, 22, called Strasbourg's ambulance service with severe stomach pain and said: ""I'm going to die"". ""You'll definitely die one day, like everyone else,"" the operator replied. The woman - who wishes to remain anonymous - told French TV on Sunday night that she was under pressure and the emergency services were overworked. Asked if she regretted what she had said, the operator replied: ""In the conditions... let's say it was inappropriate. ""We are constantly under pressure... I can be two or three hours hanging on my phone, I have no time to get up there's so much [demand] everywhere,"" she said. ""We hang up and we pick up."" She said some of her colleagues working in the medical emergency services had received threats since news of Musenga's death had emerged. Naomi Musenga's family has called for appeasement over the death of their daughter Musenga's family have refused to blame the operator, saying they recognise her poor working conditions, France's BFMTV reported. The operator's lawyer told BFMTV last week said that she would normally field on average 2,000 calls a day. ""When... you hear: 'I have a stomach ache'... it is true that the first reflex is to think that there is no absolute emergency and that one has to go and see their GP,"" the lawyer said. The head of France's association of emergency doctors said last week that the number of ambulance emergencies had mushroomed from eight million in 1988 to 21 million today, while the number of calls had trebled. Strasbourg's hospital said that on the day of the call, the operator had just returned from being on leave for two weeks and had begun her day at 07:30 that day. Ms Musenga called four hours later, at 11:30. On front line with ambulance service How a speedy emergency services app is saving lives In the three-minute call, Musenga - in a very weak voice - appealed for help and struggled to describe her pain while speaking with the ambulance service, Samu. The operator, sounding annoyed, replied: ""If you don't tell me what's going on, I'll hang up!"" The operator eventually called SOS MÃ©decins, which sends out doctors instead of an ambulance, and, after a five-hour wait, Musenga was taken to hospital by the ambulance service. She suffered a stroke at the hospital and was transferred to the intensive care unit, but later died of multiple organ failure. The case dates back to December, but only came to light when a recording of the call, obtained by the victim's family, waspublished by a local website.,external The operator, who had worked for the Samu for four years and as an ambulance worker for 20, according to the Le Parisien newspaper, has been suspended, and the authorities have opened an investigation. A spokesman for the French government said authorities were looking at speeding up promised moves towards a single emergency number, after Ms Musenga called the wrong one when seeking help. France has separate numbers for police, ambulance, and the fire brigade, along with the European Union emergency number 112. Spokesman Benjamin Griveaux conceded that French people were more familiar with the American number 911 than their own array of numbers.

"British Gas owner Centrica lost 110,000 energy supply accounts in the first four months of the year. That is roughly equivalent to 70,000 customers as many households buy their gas and electricity from British Gas, so will have two accounts. Last year, the company lost 1.3 million energy accounts. Centrica said there had been ""high levels of competitive intensity"", but said the rate at which it has been losing customers had been slowing. The company has almost 13 million energy supply accounts in the UK. How to switch energy supplier Many of those used more energy during the spell of extreme cold weather earlier this year, which was branded the Beast from the East. Centrica said it had seen ""increased energy demand"" during that period. However, the weather also caused an ""exceptionally"" high number of boiler breakdowns. British Gas saw a surge in call-outs for broken central heating systems earlier this year In one week Centrica fixed 145,000 breakdowns - more than twice the normal weekly number. It said the cost of those extra callouts was expected to hit results at its service unit in the first half of the year. In April,British Gas announced a 5.5% increase in both gas and electricity bills, which comes into effect at the end of the this month. It blamed the rising wholesale cost of energy and the cost of meeting emissions targets and introducing smart meters. Son of a joiner becomes UK's richest man Pianist wins BBC Young Musician title just days before GCSEs Should we all become early risers? Other big energy firms have also announced price increases this year, including Npower, EDF and Scottish Power. Rising energy prices have spurred record numbers of customers to switch suppliers. In the first three months of the year, 1.3 million customers switched energy supplier - a record quarter, according to Energy UK. That intense competition was partly behind4,000 job cuts announcedby Centrica in February. It also blamed the planned introduction of an energy price cap. About 12 million households are on some form of uncapped default tariff, which can cost hundreds of pounds a year more than the cheapest deals. The government wants to cap those tariffs and legislation to do that is currently working its way through Parliament.

"British Gas owner Centrica lost 110,000 energy supply accounts in the first four months of the year. That is roughly equivalent to 70,000 customers as many households buy their gas and electricity from British Gas, so will have two accounts. Last year, the company lost 1.3 million energy accounts. Centrica said there had been ""high levels of competitive intensity"", but said the rate at which it has been losing customers had been slowing. The company has almost 13 million energy supply accounts in the UK. How to switch energy supplier Many of those used more energy during the spell of extreme cold weather earlier this year, which was branded the Beast from the East. Centrica said it had seen ""increased energy demand"" during that period. However, the weather also caused an ""exceptionally"" high number of boiler breakdowns. British Gas saw a surge in call-outs for broken central heating systems earlier this year In one week Centrica fixed 145,000 breakdowns - more than twice the normal weekly number. It said the cost of those extra callouts was expected to hit results at its service unit in the first half of the year. In April,British Gas announced a 5.5% increase in both gas and electricity bills, which comes into effect at the end of the this month. It blamed the rising wholesale cost of energy and the cost of meeting emissions targets and introducing smart meters. Son of a joiner becomes UK's richest man Pianist wins BBC Young Musician title just days before GCSEs Should we all become early risers? Other big energy firms have also announced price increases this year, including Npower, EDF and Scottish Power. Rising energy prices have spurred record numbers of customers to switch suppliers. In the first three months of the year, 1.3 million customers switched energy supplier - a record quarter, according to Energy UK. That intense competition was partly behind4,000 job cuts announcedby Centrica in February. It also blamed the planned introduction of an energy price cap. About 12 million households are on some form of uncapped default tariff, which can cost hundreds of pounds a year more than the cheapest deals. The government wants to cap those tariffs and legislation to do that is currently working its way through Parliament.

"In 1975, Xia Boyu handed his sleeping bag to a suffering teammate - and lost both feet to frostbite A Chinese climber who was crippled by frostbite on Everest more than 40 years ago has scaled the summit at the start of this year's climbing season. In 1975, Xia Boyu lost his feet after giving his sleeping bag to a sick teammate during a high-altitude storm. Now aged 69, he became the second double amputee to scale Everest - and the first ever from the Nepalese side. Australian Steve Plain, meanwhile, set the record for the fastest climb of the highest mountains on seven continents. Plain's achievement also features a story of overcoming physical challenge, coming four years after he broke his neck in a surfing accident. The storm that caused Xia's frostbite struck in the ""death zone"" above 8,000m (26,200ft) and stranded his team for three nights, not far from the summit. As a result, he needed to have his feet amputated. Then, in 1996, his legs were amputated above the knee as he battled lymphoma. Despite his injuries, he never abandoned the notion of reaching the summit. ""Climbing Mount Everest is my dream,"" he told AFP news agency in April. ""I have to realise it. It also represents a personal challenge, a challenge of fate."" Allow Facebook content? This article contains content provided by Facebook.

After the disastrous 1975 climb, he made three more attempts, in 2014, 2015 and 2016. The 2016 attempt brought him close to the summit before a blizzard set in. However, a ban on climbers like Xia almost ended his attempts. Nepalese authorities moved last year to ban double amputees- along with blind and solo climbers - from attempting to reach the summit. The authorities said the new rules were a safety measure but they were struck down by the courts earlier this year as discriminatory. Sherpa to make record 22nd Everest bid Everest clean-up campaign begins On Monday, supported by a team of Sherpa guides, Xia reached the summit in what the Himalayan Times says is the first successful double amputee climb from the Nepal side. It also makes him only the second double-amputee to ever reach the summit of the world's highest mountain.Mark Inglis, of New Zealand, became the first when he reached the summit in 2006,external. Inglis also lost his limbs to frostbite in a climbing accident, after spending two weeks in an ice cave sheltering from a mountain storm. Steve Plain also took advantage of the first day possible to reach the summit, setting his four-month speed record for the seven continents. Both Plain and Xia's teams had already begun their climb when Sherpa guides affixed ropes to the summit, opening the final leg of the route for the climbing season. That meant that Plain could reach his seventh mountain peak on his seventh continent in just 117 days - shaving nine days off the previous record. Allow YouTube content?

He suffered a broken neck or ""hangman's fracture"" and said doctors had told him they were not sure if he would ever walk again. ""Three and a half years ago I was lying in hospital with a broken neck and at that time set myself the goal,"" he wrote on Facebook after reaching the summit. Plain has also been using his record attempt to raise money for charities the  Surf Life Saving Association and SpinalCure Australia - two groups he has close associations with after his own injuries.

"UK scientists believe they may have found a way to combat the common cold. Rather than attacking the virus itself, which comes in hundreds of versions, the treatment targets the human host. It blocks a key protein in the body's cells that cold viruses normally hijack to self-replicate and spread. This should stop any cold virus in its tracks if given early enough,lab studies suggest,external. Safety trials in people could start within two years. The Imperial College London researchers are working on making a form of the drug that can be inhaled, to reduce the chance of side-effects. What to do if you have a cold or flu Sneezing myths and facts In the lab, it worked within minutes of being applied to human lung cells, targeting a human protein called NMT, Nature Chemistry journal reports. All strains of cold virus need this human protein to make new copies of themselves. Researcher Prof Ed Tate said: ""The idea is that we could give it to someone when they first become infected and it would stop the virus being able to replicate and spread. ""Even if the cold has taken hold, it still might help lessen the symptoms. ""This could be really helpful for people with health conditions like asthma, who can get quite ill when they catch a cold."" He said targeting the host rather than the infection was ""a bit radical"" but made sense because the viral target was such a tricky one. Cold viruses are not only plentiful and diverse, they also evolve rapidly, meaning they can quickly develop resistance to drugs. The test drug completely blocked several strains of cold virus without appearing to harm the human cells in the lab. Further studies are needed to make sure it is not toxic in the body though. Dr Peter Barlow of the British Society for Immunology said: ""While this study was conducted entirely in vitro - using cells to model Rhinovirus infection in the laboratory - it shows great promise in terms of eventually developing a drug treatment to combat the effects of this virus in patients."" Colds spread very easily from person to person. And the viruses that cause the infections can live on hands and surfaces for 24 hours. Painkillers and cold remedies might help ease the symptoms. But currently there is nothing that will halt the infection. You can catch a cold by: inhaling tiny droplets of fluid that contain the cold virus - these are launched into the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes touching an object or surface contaminated by infected droplets and then touching your mouth, nose or eyes touching the skin of someone who has the infected droplets on their skin and then touching your mouth, nose or eyes Symptoms - a runny or blocked nose, sneezing and sore throat - usually come on quickly and peak after a couple of days. Most people will feel better after a week or so. But a mild cough can persist for a few weeks.

"This video can not be played Hundreds of people paid their respects outside Goodison Park Crowds of well-wishers have lined the streets in Liverpool to pay their respects to Alfie Evans. The 23-month-old, from Bootle in Merseyside, had a degenerative brain condition and died on 28 April. His case drew international attention when it became the centre of a High Court legal battle over his care. People gathered outside Everton's Goodison Park stadium as the procession passed following a private funeral service. Alfie's father Tom Evans is a keen supporter of the Premier League club and had spoken of his hopes to take his son to watch the Blues in action. A vigil was held on Wednesday on what would have been Alfie's second birthday As the hearse passed, small soldiers could be seen on the side of the white coffin, and the words ""warrior"" and ""our hero"" were written in white flowers on the roof. The crowd applauded and some threw flowers as the procession made its way slowly up the road. Although the funeral service is private, crowds have gathered outside Everton's Goodison Park stadium Kayleigh Thomas wants to show support for the family of Alfie Evans Ch Insp Chris Gibson, from Merseyside Police, said Alfie's parents Tom and Kate ""continue to thank the community"". Who was Alfie Evans? Kayleigh Thomas, 27, from Norris Green, attended with her five-year-old daughter Esme. She said: ""Alfie's Army are always here and always will be to support Tom and Kate and the rest of the family."" Tributes have been placed outside Goodison Park since Alfie's death Alfie, who was born in May 2016, was first admitted to Liverpool's Alder Hey Hospital in December of that year after suffering seizures, and was a patient there until his death. He had been in a semi-vegetative state for more than a year before his life support was withdrawn in April. The crowd applauded and some threw flowers as the procession passed Goodison Park, home to Everton FC Several hundred mourners and supporters of Alfie Evans lined Walton Road, outside Goodison Park, to pay their respects to the toddler whose tragic story had captured their hearts. Some wore T-shirts with a picture of Alfie and the words: ""The boy who brought the world together."" As Alfie's funeral procession made its way slowly up the road, the crowd applauded and some people threw flowers. Some people wept as the procession passed by while others simply waved their goodbyes. Alfie's parents' campaign against the decision saw them clash with doctors over his treatment. They lost all legal challenges to a court ruling allowing the hospital to withdraw ventilation. Alfie's parents Kate James and Tom Evans had contested the hospital's decision The case attracted widespread attention including from the Pope, who tweeted his support for the family.Alfie's parents had also wanted to fly their son to Italyfor further treatment.

"Safaa Boular denies two counts of preparing acts of terrorism A teenage girl fantasised about killing Barack Obama in online chats with her Islamic State fighter fiance, an Old Bailey jury has been told. Safaa Boular, 18, sent Naweed Hussain an image of an explosion when he asked how she would kill the then US president, the court heard. Prosecutors say after he died in Syria before she could join him, she planned an attack at London's British Museum. Ms Boular of Vauxhall, south London, denies preparing acts of terrorism. Her lawyer, Joel Bennathan QC, says she was ""groomed to be radicalised"" by her fiancÃ©, and her family had encouraged and celebrated it. Prosecutor Duncan Atkinson QC told the jury that Ms Boular chatted online with Hussain over a three-month period. She had to wanted to marry Hussain, who was in his 30s, and wear suicide belts together, he told the court. Describing the online conversations between the pair, he said they had exchanged pictures of a Kalashnikov rifle, grenades and a handgun in August 2016. The jury heard Ms Boular sent Hussain a picture of Mr Obama and asked ""So what, is it us Vs..."" He allegedly replied ""Yeah"" and called Mr Obama a ""filthy kalb"" [Arabic for dog]. The prosecutor said Hussain asked how she would kill him ""if u had da choice"", prompting Ms Boular to send the image of an explosion and say ""shake my hand with Mr President"". Two days later they declared their love for each other after talking about how they liked British television game shows Deal Or No Deal, The Chase and Family Fortunes, Mr Atkinson added. The jury heard Ms Boular, who was still 17 when she was arrested, told police she had wanted to go to Syria because everyone dies sometime, and she ""might as well die with honour"". Ms Boular said Hussain, a Briton from Coventry, had approached her on Instagram. She had connected with IS supporters on the photo-sharing website through a woman based in Aleppo, Syria, she had met on Twitter, the court heard. Her interest had been sparked by the Paris attacks and she was ""curious"" to find out ""why people do the things they do"", she said. The court heard Ms Boular decided to carry out a grenade and gun ambush on people at the British Museum after Hussain was killed. But when Ms Boular was charged with planning to travel to IS territory, she is alleged to have encouraged her older sister to ""carry the torch forward"". The court heard that Rizlaine Boular, 21, of Clerkenwell, central London, has admitted planning a knife attack, while their mother Mina Dich, 43, has admitted assisting her. In telephone calls to her sister from jail, Safaa Boular is alleged to have talked about an Alice in Wonderland-themed tea party - said by the prosecution to be code for the attack her sister was to carry out. Based on her reconnaissance and discussion, it appears Rizlaine Boular planned a knife attack in Westminster, the prosecution says. The court heard Safaa Boular told police Hussain had raised Â£3,000 to help her and Rizlaine travel to Syria. The trial was adjourned until Tuesday.

It said the cost of those extra callouts was expected to hit results at its service unit in the first half of the year. In April,British Gas announced a 5.5% increase in both gas and electricity bills, which comes into effect at the end of the this month. It blamed the rising wholesale cost of energy and the cost of meeting emissions targets and introducing smart meters.

Other big energy firms have also announced price increases this year, including Npower, EDF and Scottish Power. Rising energy prices have spurred record numbers of customers to switch suppliers. In the first three months of the year, 1.3 million customers switched energy supplier - a record quarter, according to Energy UK. That intense competition was partly behind4,000 job cuts announcedby Centrica in February. It also blamed the planned introduction of an energy price cap. About 12 million households are on some form of uncapped default tariff, which can cost hundreds of pounds a year more than the cheapest deals. The government wants to cap those tariffs and legislation to do that is currently working its way through Parliament.

"A spate of attacks blamed on militant Islamists has rocked Indonesia A suicide bombing at a police headquarters in the Indonesian city of Surabaya on Monday was carried out by a family of five riding on two motorbikes, police say. It came afteranother family carried out bomb attacks on three churches on Sunday. Police blamed an Islamic State-inspired network. An eight-year-old daughter survived the latest attack, police say. Indonesia is the world's most populous Muslim-majority country. The archipelago, home to 260 million people, has seen a resurgence of Islamist militancy in recent years but the scale of the attacks in Surabaya has raised fresh concerns about the potency of jihadist networks. Video footage of the latest attack on the police headquarters shows two motorbikes approaching a checkpoint just before the blast. Six civilians and four police officers were injured, the authorities say. The young girl who survived had been wedged between her mother and father on the motorbike as they carried out the attack. CCTV footage shows her stumbling around after the blast. Parents who bring their children to die Why is Indonesia a target for IS militants? Sent out to die: The young women used in militant attacks Indonesia was on high alert after bombings on Sunday by a single family targeted three churches in Surabaya, the capital of East Java province. The mother targeted one church alongside her two daughters, aged nine and 12, while the father and two sons attacked two other churches. Indonesian police released this picture of the family they said was responsible for Sunday's series of attacks The incident represented the first time a female suicide bomber had successfully carried out an attack, national police chief Tito Karnavian said. A 28-year-old woman had planned to bomb the Presidential Palace last year but was caught and jailed, he added. The authorities originally said the family of six were among hundreds of Indonesians who had returned from conflict-hit Syria but have since said the family did not actually travel there. The coordinated attacks killed 18 people, including the bombers, and injured more than 40. They were the deadliest bombings in Indonesia in more than a decade. Inside the home of Indonesia's most notorious IS militant More on Indonesia Police say the father, Dita Oepriarto, was the head of the local branch of Jemaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD), an Indonesian IS-inspired network. Six members of the same family carried out a series of attacks on Sunday: 1. Two teenaged sons rode motorcycles into Santa Maria Catholic Church and detonated explosives at 07:30 local time (00:30 GMT) 2. The father drove a bomb-laden car at Surabaya Centre Pentecostal Church at 07:35 local time 3. A mother, with her two daughters, carried out a bomb attack on Diponegoro Indonesian Christian Church a few minutes later There was another suspected terror-linked incident on Sunday night: 4. A bomb exploded at Rusunawa Wonocolo flats, Sidoarjo regency at around 21:00 local time A second family carried out an attack on Monday: 5. The family of five rode motorbikes to a checkpoint at Surabaya police headquarters and detonated bombs at 08:50 local time The bomb that exploded on Sunday night in an apartment killed three members of a family who police said may have been planning an attack and had connections with Oepriarto. Pipe bombs were found. Separately, police said on Monday that they had arrested six people plotting attacks in Surabaya, the Jakarta Post reported. President Joko Widodo has described the attacks as ""cowardly, undignified and inhumane"" and said he will push through a long-awaited anti-terrorism bill if parliament does not pass it. The bill has faced criticism from human rights groups, but defenders say it is needed to prosecute militants returning from the Middle East. ""There will be no compromise in taking action on the ground to stop terrorism,"" he said. Officials said police, backed by military forces, would increase security across the country. This video can not be played Sunday's deadly bombings shocked Indonesia In Australia, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said the nature of Sunday's attack - involving an entire family - ""almost beggars belief"". ""These people are the worst of the worst. They are threatening civilised nations, they're threatening civilised way of life. They're threatening people's harmony and religion. They are debasing and defaming Islam, as President Widodo has often said."" A burnt-out car in front of one of the bombed churches in Surabaya The South East Asian country has long struggled with Islamist militancy.Indonesia's worst ever terror attack was in Bali in 2002, when 202 people - mostly foreigners - were killed in an attack on a tourist nightlife district. That attack was carried out by the Jemaah Islamiah (JI) militant network and prompted a sustained crackdown on militants. The first attack claimed by IS in Indonesia took place in January 2016, when four civilians and four attackers were killed in a series of explosions and shootings in central Jakarta. IS-inspired groups have since mostly carried out ""amateurish"" plots but the attacks in Surabaya suggest better planning and a higher level of ""technical proficiency"", Zachary Abuza of the National War College in Washington DC told the BBC. The use of children in the attacks was ""absolutely unprecedented"" in the region, he said, and speaks to the ""ideological indoctrination"" of JAD. By BBC Monitoring â¢ JAD is a local network of Indonesian militants who have pledged allegiance to IS â¢ The group was formed in 2015 following a merger of several militant factions run by influential Indonesian cleric and convicted terrorist Aman Abdurrahman â¢ Abdurrahman, also known as Oman Rochman, is serving a nine-year prison sentence but is said to manage his followers, conduct recruitment and spread IS propaganda from behind bars â¢ JAD campaigns for a caliphate system across Indonesia and says it is ""justified in using violence"" to do so.

"This video can not be played Hundreds of people paid their respects outside Goodison Park Crowds of well-wishers have lined the streets in Liverpool to pay their respects to Alfie Evans. The 23-month-old, from Bootle in Merseyside, had a degenerative brain condition and died on 28 April. His case drew international attention when it became the centre of a High Court legal battle over his care. People gathered outside Everton's Goodison Park stadium as the procession passed following a private funeral service. Alfie's father Tom Evans is a keen supporter of the Premier League club and had spoken of his hopes to take his son to watch the Blues in action. A vigil was held on Wednesday on what would have been Alfie's second birthday As the hearse passed, small soldiers could be seen on the side of the white coffin, and the words ""warrior"" and ""our hero"" were written in white flowers on the roof. The crowd applauded and some threw flowers as the procession made its way slowly up the road. Although the funeral service is private, crowds have gathered outside Everton's Goodison Park stadium Kayleigh Thomas wants to show support for the family of Alfie Evans Ch Insp Chris Gibson, from Merseyside Police, said Alfie's parents Tom and Kate ""continue to thank the community"". Who was Alfie Evans? Kayleigh Thomas, 27, from Norris Green, attended with her five-year-old daughter Esme. She said: ""Alfie's Army are always here and always will be to support Tom and Kate and the rest of the family."" Tributes have been placed outside Goodison Park since Alfie's death Alfie, who was born in May 2016, was first admitted to Liverpool's Alder Hey Hospital in December of that year after suffering seizures, and was a patient there until his death. He had been in a semi-vegetative state for more than a year before his life support was withdrawn in April. The crowd applauded and some threw flowers as the procession passed Goodison Park, home to Everton FC Several hundred mourners and supporters of Alfie Evans lined Walton Road, outside Goodison Park, to pay their respects to the toddler whose tragic story had captured their hearts.

As Alfie's funeral procession made its way slowly up the road, the crowd applauded and some people threw flowers. Some people wept as the procession passed by while others simply waved their goodbyes. Alfie's parents' campaign against the decision saw them clash with doctors over his treatment. They lost all legal challenges to a court ruling allowing the hospital to withdraw ventilation. Alfie's parents Kate James and Tom Evans had contested the hospital's decision The case attracted widespread attention including from the Pope, who tweeted his support for the family.Alfie's parents had also wanted to fly their son to Italyfor further treatment.

"Sunanda Pushkar was found dead in her hotel room in January 2014 Indian MP and former UN diplomat Shashi Tharoor has been charged with aiding his wifeâs suicide in 2014. Sunanda Pushkar's unexplained death was initially treated as suicide but police later said she had been murdered, without naming a suspect. Police in Delhi have now charged Mr Tharoor with abetment to suicide and cruelty to his spouse. Mr Tharoor tweeted to say he intended to ""vigorously"" contest the ""preposterous charges"" against him. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Tharoor, an MP with India's main opposition Congress party, married Ms Pushkar, a former Dubai-based businesswoman, in 2010. She was found dead in a five-star hotel in Delhi on 17 January 2014. The cause of death is still unclear. The first post-mortem report after her death suggested she may have died of a drug overdose - reports said Ms Pushkar had been on medication. Subsequent reports since then spoke of ""poisoning"", ""mysterious injection marks"" and according to one report, a ""deep bite"" on her palm. The couple became embroiled in controversy over a series of Twitter messages before Ms Pushkar's death that appeared to reveal Mr Tharoor was having an affair with a Pakistani journalist. Ms Pushkar and Mr Tharoor later insisted they were happily married and blamed ""unauthorised tweets"" for causing confusion. Shashi Tharoor's very public tragedy India's Shashi Tharoor wife 'overdosed on drugs' A career diplomat for 25 years, Mr Tharoor served as undersecretary general at the United Nations for communications and public information. In 2007, he lost the election for the post of UN secretary-general to Ban Ki-moon, after which he announced his retirement from the United Nations. He entered Indian politics in 2009, but was forced to resign from his first ministerial position in 2010 amid controversy over his involvement in bidding for a cricket team. Ms Pushkar had allegedly received a free stake in the Indian Premier League franchise he was bidding for. He was appointed minister of state for human resource development in 2012. In Indian law, abetment to suicide means instigating someone to kill themselves. It is usually punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a fine. That can rise to life imprisonment or even the death penalty if the deceased was under 18, suffering from mental infirmity, or in a state of intoxication. However, judges in India are only meant to impose the death penalty in cases considered ""the rarest of rare"".

"The John Lewis gift list service became inaccessible because of a glitch in renewing the website domain John Lewis has apologised to betrothed couples and other users of its gift list website after the service went offline over the weekend. Visitors were presented with error messages saying that the site's domain registration had expired. In some cases they were invited to renew the lease themselves. Organisations typically set active web domains to auto-renew to avoid such problems, but John Lewis says there was an ""issue"" with renewing its domain. Several customers had tweeted the business seeking an explanation, and had been told in response that users needed to phone staff while the matter was being addressed. ""Our wedding is on 19 May, and despite only having a week to go a lot of our friends had yet to visit [the site]"", bride-to-be Clare Briscoe told the BBC. ""The lack of information from John Lewis was concerning - I had to join Twitter to try to get more information. ""I had a lot of other bits of admin to get done rather than [having to] reassure guests that it would 'probably' be fine. ""I'm happy it seems to be sorted now, but not renewing a domain registration is fairly embarrassing."" PinkNews chief executive Benjamin Cohen was also among those affected. Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played MI5 chief condemns Russia's 'aggressive' actions Russia is seeking to undermine European democracies with ""malign activities"",the MI5 chief has warned,external. Speaking to security chiefs in Berlin, Andrew Parker also condemned Russia for the ""reckless"" poisoning of the Skripals in Salisbury. Russia has denied involvement in the poisoning of Russian ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia. Mr Parker also warned Islamic State aspires to commit ""devastating"" and ""more complex"" attacks in Europe. In his first public comments about the nerve agent attack in March, Mr Parker accused the Kremlin of ""flagrant breaches of international rules"". ""The reckless attempted assassination of Sergei Skripal, using a highly lethal nerve agent, put numerous lives at risk, including that of his daughter,"" he said. ""It was only through near-miraculous medical intervention that his and his daughter's lives were saved, and wider preventive action was able to be taken."" Yulia and Sergei Skripal were found collapsed on a bench in the centre of Salisbury The Russian government has repeatedly rejected accusations it was involved in the attack. It has been the subject of condemnation and diplomatic sanctions from the West over its alleged involvement. Mr Parker said the Kremlin was taking part in ""deliberate, targeted, malign activity intended to undermine our free, open and democratic societies"". He criticised Russia's invasion of Crimea and its alleged interference in Western elections. And he condemned Moscow by calling for the need ""to shine a light through the fog of lies, half-truths and obfuscation that pours out of their propaganda machine"". ""One of the Kremlin's central and entirely admirable aims is to build Russian greatness on the world stage,"" he said. ""But its repeated choices have been to pursue that aim through aggressive and pernicious actions by its military and intelligence services. ""Instead of becoming a respected great nation, it risks becoming a more isolated pariah."" The Russian embassy responded to the speech by tweeting a newspaper article highlighting Mr Parker's ""fog of lies"" line and saying: ""By the way, it's Britain that is notorious for fogs.""

""As I speak today, they are seeking to regroup, and the threat seems likely to persist."" Mr Parker's speechcomes after one person was killed and four others were injured by a knifeman in Parison Saturday. The attack was claimed by IS.

"This video can not be played Gaza's deadliest day of violence in years At least 52 Palestinians have been killed and 2,400 wounded by Israeli troops, Palestinian officials say, on the deadliest day of violence since the 2014 Gaza war. Palestinians have been protesting for weeks but deaths soared on the day the US opened its embassy in Jerusalem. Palestinians see this as clear US backing for Israeli rule over the whole city, whose eastern part they claim. But US President Donald Trump hailed the move in a video message. He told the dedication ceremony that it had been a ""long time coming"", adding: ""Israel is a sovereign nation with the right to determine its own capital but for many years we failed to acknowledge the obvious."" The day's events as they happened What makes Jerusalem so holy? The US, he added, remained ""committed to facilitating a lasting peace agreement"". There have been six weeks of protests at the Gaza border, dubbed the ""Great March of Return"" and led by Gaza's Islamist rulers Hamas. Hamas had always said it would step up the protests before Tuesday, when Palestinians hold their annual commemoration of what they call theNakbaor Catastrophe. Hundreds of thousands fled their homes or were displaced following the foundation of the Israeli state on 14 May 1948. Hundreds of people have been injured, according to Palestinian officials On Monday, the Israeli military said 40,000 Palestinians had taken part in ""violent riots"" at 13 locations along the Gaza Strip security fence. Palestinians hurled stones and incendiary devices while the Israeli military used snipers, as black smoke poured from burning tyres. The health ministry, run by Hamas, said children were among those killed. The Israeli military said it had killed three people trying to plant explosives near the security fence in Rafah. Aircraft and tanks had also targeted military positions belonging to Hamas in the northern Gaza Strip, it said. Israel says the protests are aimed at breaching the border and attacking Israeli communities nearby. There were also violent clashes between Israeli police and protesters who raised Palestinian flags outside the new embassy. Several protesters were detained. Feras Kilani, BBC Arabic, at the protests in Gaza Tuesday is expected to be a very big demonstration because it is a day known by the Palestinians as the ""Catastrophe"" that followed the creation of the state of Israel. Palestinians will go to bury the dozens of people killed on Monday and then they will come again to demonstrate. You can imagine the situation with all this anger, thousands of Palestinians will come here and will try to cross the fence to return to what they see as their land - what they do not see as Israel but as Palestine. It is expected to be bigger than Monday and more bloody. Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas condemned what he called Israeli ""massacres against our people"", and declared three days of mourning. Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu said: ""Every nation has the right to defend its borders. Hamas clearly says its intentions are to destroy Israel and sends thousands to break through the border for that end."" A number of Western nations including the UK called for restraint. EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said: ""We expect all to act with utmost restraint to avoid further loss of life"" Germany said Israel had the right to defend itself but should do so proportionately One of the strongest statements came from UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, who condemned the ""shocking killing of dozens, injury of hundreds by Israeli live fire"" Allow Twitter content?

This video can not be played Donald Trump addresses the ceremony via videolink The opening ceremony was brought forward to coincide with the state of Israel's 70th anniversary. Mr Trump's daughter, Ivanka, and her husband Jared Kushner, who are both senior White House advisers, joined US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan for the ceremony. How did the world react to embassy move? Five key takeaways from Jerusalem decision After Ivanka Trump had unveiled the seal of the embassy, Mr Kushner said in his address: ""When President Trump makes a promise he keeps it... We have shown the world that the US can be trusted. We stand with our friends and allies."" Mr Kushner also referred to Mr Trump's withdrawal from the ""dangerous, flawed and one-sided Iran deal"", drawing applause from the guests. Mr Netanyahu said: ""What a glorious day. Remember this moment. This is history. President Trump, by recognising history, you have made history. All of us are deeply grateful."" Mahmoud Abbas condemned the embassy as a ""settlement in East Jerusalem"", saying that the US was ""no longer a mediator in the Middle East"". Arab League chief Ahmed Abul Gheit said it was ""shameful to see countries participating with the US and Israel in celebrating the former's embassy move to occupied Jerusalem in a clear and grave violation of international law"". The status of Jerusalem goes to the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Can the settlement issue be solved? The alternatives to a two-state solution Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem is not recognised internationally and, according to the 1993 Israel-Palestinian peace accords, the final status of Jerusalem is meant to be discussed in the latter stages of peace talks. Israel has occupied East Jerusalem since the 1967 Middle East war. It effectively annexed the sector, though this was not recognised by any countries until Mr Trump's declaration in December 2017. This video can not be played Why the ancient city of Jerusalem is so important Since 1967, Israel has built a dozen settlements, home to about 200,000 Jews, in East Jerusalem. These are considered illegal under international law, although Israel disputes this. Why do evangelicals support Trump on Jerusalem? Various countries once had embassies based in Jerusalem but many moved after Israel passed a law in 1980 formally making Jerusalem its capital. Why Jerusalem matters.

"A major review of whether MI5 could have stopped any of 2017's terrorism attacks has revealed details of opportunities that, had they been followed through, might have stopped two of them. The report prepared by former terrorism laws watchdog David Anderson QC,externalis a public version of a review by the intelligence and security establishment that runs to more than 1,000 pages. Khalid Masood was shot at the scene of the Westminster attack Khalid Masood killed five people- four members of the public and PC Keith Palmer On 9 March, Masood bought two carving knives in Birmingham and sent himself an email with the subject line ""retaliation"". The review says he had a document, with his photograph on the front page, that contained multiple religious quotes that are often used to justify violence. A few minutes before the attack, Masood shared his Jihad document with contacts by WhatsApp and text message. Now, we already knew that Masood had been investigated as a potential extremist in 2010 - but the first trace of him in MI5's systems dates back to April 2004. A telephone associated with him appeared in the contact list of an individual who was already part of a major investigation. At the time, Masood was living in Crawley, West Sussex - and the town was the epicentre of theOperation Crevice investigation,externalthat smashed the then biggest terrorist plot in Britain. Masood was designated as an MI5 ""Subject of Interest"" (SOI) - meaning someone it is trying to investigate - in 2010 after he was found to be an associate of people trying to get to an al-Qaeda training camp in Pakistan. By the end of the year, investigators concluded he wasn't a threat and he was removed from the live SOIs list. Over the next four years he intermittently popped up as a contact of people involved in the banned network once headed by the hate preacher Anjem Choudary. Profile: Who was the Westminster Bridge attacker Khalid Masood? Salman Abedi was born in Manchester on New Year's Eve 1994 to Libyan parents Salman Abedi killed 22 people when he detonated a homemade bomb outside the Ariana Grande concert Abedi was first actively investigated by MI5 in January 2014. He was thought to be an associate of a  suspect - but was discounted by July when it turned out he was not the man investigators wanted. In October 2015, he again became a subject of interest for a single day because it was thought, erroneously, that he was in direct contact with a member of the Islamic State group in Libya. However, that's not the whole story. The report says: ""MI5 ... came by intelligence [on Abedi] in the months before the attack which, had its true significance been properly understood, would have caused an investigation into him to be opened."" Those two pieces of undisclosed intelligence were thought to relate to crime, rather than terrorism. Was this a missed opportunity? MI5 concluded that the intelligence was insufficient. But Mr Anderson's review states: ""It is conceivable that the Manchester attack... might have been averted had the cards fallen differently."" MI5 has conceded that it missed an opportunity to place Abedi on a port watch list - which would have meant he could have been questioned on his return from Libya, days before the attack. There is another twist. Before the the attack, analysts used a ""data-washing"" exercise to go through 20,000 closed cases to see if there were any leads they should follow up. Abedi was one of a ""small number"" of individuals whose name came up. Mr Anderson says they were closing in on him - and MI5 had planned a meeting to discuss the names on the shortlist. That case conference was scheduled for nine days after Abedi became a mass murderer. Profile: Who was the Manchester attacker, Salman Abedi? Khuram Butt, Rachid Redouane and Youssef Zaghba have been named as the London Bridge attackers Khuram Butt, Rachid Redouane and Youssef Zaghba killed eight people, before being shot dead by police The most serious revelations of missed opportunities relate to Butt, the ringleader, because he was under ""active investigation"". The probe opened in mid-2015 after the intelligence agencies received information that Butt aspired to carry out an attack in the UK. He was important enough to be watched over the coming two years. MI5 uses a ""triage system"" to prioritise who needs the most monitoring. Suspects can go up and down the priority ladder, depending on whether other threats are more pressing. Butt was two notches below the highest priority. That means he was thought to be involved in the steps linked to attack planning, such as training and fundraising. He was not a bit part player - he warranted his own investigation. After a few months, he was downgraded a notch to ""medium risk"" because investigators concluded he did not have the capabilities. Priority 1: Investigations into individuals or networks where there is ""credible and actionable intelligence"" of significant or smaller scale attack planning Priority 2: Investigations relating to individuals involved in travel overseas to join Jihad, fundraising, training and supply of false documents Priority 3: Investigations or networks that require further action to determine whether they pose a threat Priority 4: Those who had once posed a serious threat where there is a risk they may re-engage in extremist activity Closed SOIs: The 20,000 closed cases of people no longer actively subject to investigation Butt remained involved with known extremists-and MI5 believed he was thinking of going to Syria. After the Bataclan attack in Paris, the active investigation into Butt was suspended for two months as officers were diverted onto more urgent operations. It was suspended for a second time the day before the Westminster attack. When it re-opened, Butt was further downgraded to an ""unresolved"" risk. Throughout 2017, it now transpires, Butt was deepening his relationship with his co-conspirators, Youssef Zaghba and Rachid Redouane. MI5 now thinks that the three got together at a gym in east London - and that Zaghba may have helped Butt to teach Koranic classes to children at the same centre. The report also reveals that MI5 had intelligence about a Moroccan called ""Rashid"" who was a friend of Butt's. Profile: Who was London Bridge attacker Khuram Butt? One man dies after a van is driven at worshippers leaving a mosque Mr Anderson's report says that MI5 held no intelligence that could have prevented the attack. Darren Osborne, the man alleged to have carried out this attack, is due to face trial for murder. It says not - but Mr Anderson believes there were opportunities. Given the scale of terrorism-related activity since 2013 - when the Syria crisis gave a boost to recruitment in the UK - there is no doubt that the security service has been juggling a huge numbers of cases. The real question is whether the manpower is matched with the right data tools and relationships with other bodies to stop more of the threats before it is too late. Data analysis will play an increasingly important role in trying to spot individuals who may pose a threat after years of being quiet. Perhaps the most important change to come is that MI5 may be told to share some of what it knows with other agencies - such as local councils - in the hope that people on the ground can provide the missing piece of information they need to disrupt a threat. This raises huge cultural challenges for an organisation that necessarily operates below the radar.

"Palestinians walking on a poster of Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence in December US Vice-President Mike Pence's trip to Israel has been postponed, amid Palestinian protests against the US decision to recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital. But why does the move remain popular with evangelical Christians in the US? The Reverend Johnnie Moore, a 34-year-old evangelical Christian, is closer than most to President Trump. During the election campaign, he was co-chair of Mr Trump's evangelical advisory board. He has met the president and his team ""several times"" - most recently last month - and speaks to the White House regularly. In July, he even posted this picture of the president at prayer.

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. So he seems a good person to ask. When Mr Trump recognised Jerusalem as Israel's capital, did American evangelicals support him for Biblical reasons, as has been reported? Because of a belief in the Battle of Armageddon? The End Times? The second coming of Jesus Christ, and a thousand years of peace? Mr Moore laughs at the suggestion. ""I've never heard it come up once,"" he says. ""Not once."" The biggest religious group in the US,exceeding Catholics and ""mainline"" Protestants,external Most common in southern states, includingTennessee, Alabama, and Kentucky,external Most evangelicals believe they have been ""born again"" Evangelicals also believe in spreading the gospel, and leading others to Christ Vice-President Mike Pence describes himself as an evangelical Christian Jerusalem is important to all Christians. But the city, and Israel, is especially significant to some. This is where the End Times comes in. ""There's a segment of Christianity that believes the creation of the state of Israel (in 1948) was the fulfilment of prophecy,"" says Prof Christopher Rollston from George Washington University. ""Not just a good thing - but the fulfilment of prophecy."" The idea was popularised in a best-selling book called The Late, Great Planet Earth, released in 1970. The slim paperback, by American author Hal Lindsey, said world events - including the creation of Israel - were proving the Bible correct. To some Christians, the book validated their beliefs. It also meant the end of the world as we know it - which the Bible also predicts - was near. What makes Jerusalem so holy? Trump's unlikely Christian covenant The idea is older than Hal Lindsey, but he helped popularise it. The book sold millions of copies. Not all Evangelicals share this apocalyptic view. But some do, including a group called premillennialists. They believe in a Great Tribulation - that is, a period of war and destruction - before a thousand years of peace. ""They believe there will be, ultimately, an apocalyptic end of the age,"" says Prof Rollston. ""Replete with the Battle of Armageddon, the Mark of the Beast, these sorts of things."" So what is the connection toEnd Timesand Donald Trump recognising Jerusalem as Israel's capital? Again, says Prof Rollston, it stems from the belief that Israel's creation was foretold in the Bible. ""Anything that's supportive of the modern state of Israel, for them is a good thing,"" he says. ""It's not data driven."" Prof Rollston goes to an Episcopal (Anglican) church, but grew up around evangelicalism. He finds premillennialism ""entirely unconvincing and a misappropriation of scripture"". ""They will cite this text or that text,"" he says. ""But they're citing it entirely out of context."" This video can not be played Mr Trump said his Jerusalem decision is in the best interest of peace The Reverend Johnnie Moore agrees that some evangelicals hold premillennial, or dispensationalist, beliefs. But he thinks it's a ""very, very small group"", whose influence is exaggerated. ""I've seen all the stories,"" he says. ""'Evangelicals want Armageddon' or 'Evangelicals want the Rapture'. ""I think that is Exhibit A of people on the outside coming to conclusions about what evangelicals actually think."" Evangelicals did discuss Jerusalem in the White House. But the discussions, says Mr Moore, were political - not theological. ""The leaders know what they're talking about from experience,"" he says. ""They follow politics in the region, they know the public figures, they read the papers, they have informed foreign policy views. ""This was geo-political opinion, more than theology."" The message is echoed by David Brog, executive director of Christians United for Israel. ""There is a widespread myth that Christians support Israel to speed the End Times,"" he says. ""That's simply not true. ""Anyone who understands the theology / eschatology of pro-Israel Christians knows they believe they are powerless to change the date of End Times. ""If they are powerless to speed this day, their support for Israel must be driven by other motives. ""In the case of Jerusalem, we support President Trump's decision because it is an act of historic justice - and an overdue recognition of modern reality."" Trump's Jerusalem move: Key takeaways Clashes erupt over US Jerusalem move Like David Brog, Johnnie Moore cites non-theological reasons for supporting Mr Trump's policy. The first is that Congress passed a law in 1995 recognising Jerusalem as Israel's capital, but successive presidents have waived it on national security grounds. ""This is a law that has been defied by presidents again and again and again,"" he says. ""They have defied a congressional mandate."" He also thinks the US shouldn't dispute where a country says its capital is. ""We don't super-impose on any other nation in the world where their capital is going to be,"" he says. ""This (Jerusalem) is the seat of government of the state of Israel."" Thirdly, he doesn't believe Mr Trump's policy will harm the peace process. ""The Palestinians have referred toEastJerusalem to be the capital of a Palestinian state,"" he says. ""Which implies that at leastWestJerusalem is going to be the capital of the Israeli state. ""If you read the whole ofthe president's commentswhen he made the announcement, he actually said it was up the parties to decide the future of Jerusalem."" This video can not be played Why the ancient city of Jerusalem is so important Mr Moore visited Israel after Mr Trump's announcement and sat down with a mukhtar (a local Arab leader) in east Jerusalem. ""The mukhtar said 'What's changed? This has been the capital of Israel. Israel's government is here. The Knesset (Israeli parliament) is here. Israel's prime minister is here.' ""And he's a Muslim mukhtar in east Jerusalem."" (The mukhtar's view is at odds with other Palestinians - and the wider Arab world - who protested against President Trump's decision). Mr Moore is frustrated that - in his opinion - the evangelical position has been mis-reported. Some people don't understand their position, he says. But some do - and instead choose to ""diminish the credibility of the evangelical community"". ""We're normal people,"" he says. ""We have modern views of things. ""We talk to other people, we're peacemakers, we're bridge builders. We're not apocalyptic.""

"This video can not be played Lawyer Sulaiha Ali says victims of crime are being treated as criminals because of their immigration status More than half of UK police forces are handing over victims of crime to the Home Office for immigration enforcement, new figures show. One woman who was beaten by her partner was then herself arrested by police. There are fears the approach is stopping vulnerable people - including rape victims - reporting crimes, playing into the hands of traffickers. The Home Office said it would support vulnerable migrants ""regardless of their immigration status"". ""Victims of crime must be treated first and foremost as victims,"" a spokesperson said. The BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme asked 45 UK police forces, via a Freedom of Information request, if they referred victims and witnesses of crime to the Home Office for immigration enforcement. Twenty-seven said they did. Some gave a straight ""yes"", others had caveats such as ""not routinely"" or ""it's rare"". Three - including Police Scotland - said they did not, and the rest were unclear, did not reply or said they had no data. ""Sara"" came to the UK with her partner - a British citizen. But she says she was treated like a slave. ""He told me, 'That's why I brought you here, so you can cook and clean for me,'"" she explains. ""He beat me with a belt and a cable."" She was brought into the UK illegally, so she could not go to the police in case she was arrested - ""a common feature in all domestic violence and trafficking cases"", according to Sara's lawyer Sulaiha Ali, of Duncan Lewis Solicitors. Eventually, Sara tried to escape. She ran out on to the street, when her partner chased after her and beat her in front of a member of the public, who then called the police. They arrested the perpetrator and took Sara to hospital because of the severity of her injuries. Sara was arrested and taken to Yarl's Wood detention centre She was then taken to a hostel, where she was later arrested and sent to Yarl's Wood immigration removal centre to be deported. Ms Ali thinks Sara should never have been arrested at all. ""It's shocking to know that victims of crime are being seen and treated as criminals just because of their status."" Ms Ali has now stopped Sara's deportation order, and Sara has applied for asylum in the UK. But Ms Ali says she's doing ""quite bad"", and has not been given the support ""she is entitled to"" as a victim, because ""the focus has been completely on her immigration status"". Pragna Patel from Southall Black Sisters - which campaigns on the issue - says she is extremely worried that referring victims of crime for immigration enforcement is ""in conflict with the government's stated aim to protect all women from violence"". ""Since 2014, we've seen a steady rise in cases where the police have arrested women or reported women to the Home Office as potential illegals rather than deal with their reports of violence and rape."" She fears vulnerable women will be deterred from speaking out about the violence and abuse they have suffered because they are frightened of being arrested, detained and deported. Pragna Patel says there has been a rise in cases since 2014 Green Party leader Caroline Lucas told the Victoria Derbyshire programme she has heard of rape victims ""being afraid to come forward to report that rape, which means that the perpetrator is still at large"". She called for a ""firewall"" - a blocking of information between police operations and immigration officials - so the two do not become mixed up, and justice is not ""jeopardised"". Watch Catrin Nye's full filmon the Victoria Derbyshire programme's website. Last November, a case was uncovered in which a woman reported to the police that she had been kidnapped and raped over a six-month period. She was taken to a sexual assault centre by police, but then she was arrested. Guidance from the National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC) issued in December says that ""immediate arrest will not be made"" of victims of crime, relating to their immigration status, unless there is ""an immediate risk of harm to a specific individual"". Only three police forces said they were following this guidance. Former Ch Supt Dal Babu says it is ""easier"" for officers to send vulnerable people to a detention centre Former Ch Supt Dal Babu has called for more specific regulations for officers to follow. He said victims of crime ""were low-hanging fruit"" amid the government's hostile environment policy, which included immigration removal targets. ""These are vulnerable people... so it's much easier when a woman comes forward who has been raped to then say, 'We're investigating this', and go and arrest [her] and [she'll] be sent to a detention centre."" The NPCC said it was ""unequivocal that victims of crime should be treated as victims first and foremost. ""Each case is considered very carefully but there will be instances where police need to exchange information with the Home Office."" The Home Office said: ""When individuals are found to have no basis in the UK, we carefully consider the details of the case before taking an enforcement action."" Additional reporting by Leo Sands.

"The Oratory School says it condemns racist imagery and has apologised A boarding school has apologised after a group of boys ""blacked up"" and dressed as slaves for a photograph. Sixth-formers at the Oratory School in Oxfordshire, wore the make-up and costumes for their leaving pictures, which were published on social media. The pupils were stopped from taking part in an ""informal"" photo shoot, but took their own picture, which was posted online. The school has apologised ""unreservedly"". ""The pupils involved have been punished as part of our disciplinary process. ""We will strengthen our tutorial programme to ensure that it is understood by all our pupils that such representations are utterly unacceptable,"" a spokesman said. The school, which has fees of over Â£11,000 per term, told the BBC it takes a formal leavers' photo of its sixth-form students. It also takes an informal photo, where pupils dress up in costumes.

"There has been a sharp rise in the number of children under 11 referred for mental health treatment by schools in the last four years, figures show. Data obtained by children's charity the NSPCC shows that schools in England have made a total of 123,713 referrals for specialist help since 2014-15. But more than half of these came from primary schools. The youngest child referred for help was three years old. The government says its reforms will transform services for children. The figures were released under Freedom of Information laws to the NSPCC by 53 of the 66 health trusts known to provide mental health support to children. Issues children were referred for included depression and anxiety, sometimes these were so severe that it can lead them to the brink of suicide, said Esther Rantzen founder and president of NSPCC's Childline. In 2017-18, some 18,870 children aged under 11 were referred for specialist support. This was a rise of 5,183, or more than a third, on those referred in 2014-15. This video can not be played Child mental health: When it feels like no-one is listening The statistics also reveal that one-third of those referred to Child Adolescent Mental Health Services (Camhs) were declined help. The NSPCC said increased demand for support was placing the system under real pressure, and jeopardising the well-being of thousands of children. Its chief executive Peter Wanless said: ""Our research shows schools are increasingly referring children for specialist mental health treatment, often when the child is at crisis point."" The struggle of waiting for mental health support Counselling young 'could help economy' Sarah Hannafin, senior policy adviser at the National Association of Head Teachers, said: ""More pupils are suffering from mental health issues and there is much more awareness in schools for spotting potential problems and intervening early to get support. ""However, more than a third of referrals are not accepted - schools have referred these pupils because they are concerned about their mental health and know that the child needs more specialist support than could (and should) be offered by school staff. ""However, many of these children are not meeting the thresholds set by Camhs - many are concerned about how high these thresholds are. ""The other concern is about what support those children can then get if they have been turned down by Camhs."" Student mental health 'failing a generation' More workers ask for mental health help A government spokeswoman said they had pledged Â£1.7bn to young people's mental health and wellbeing. ""Making sure children and young people get the right support when they need it is imperative,"" she said. ""That is why are allocating Â£300 million, over and above the additional Â£1.4bn being invested in specialist services, to provide more support linked to schools. ""This includes new mental health support teams to provide trained mental health workers to work closely with schools -including primary schools - to provide quicker support to children. ""We know we need to do more which is why we have extended our schools and NHS link pilot to deliver training in 20 more areas of the country this year.

"David Miliband has urged the UK to seek a ""safe harbour"" after Brexit by staying in the European Economic Area. The ex-Labour foreign secretary said Jeremy Corbyn, who has ruled out the so-called Norway model, risked becoming the ""midwife of a hard Brexit"". Ministers say EEA membership would require the UK to accept most EU rules as well as freedom of movement. But Mr Milband told the BBC that the UK must get real, saying that 60% of UK trade was ""under European aegis"". Mr Miliband, who has worked for the International Rescue Committee in New York since 2013, joined politicians from other parties who favour retaining the closest links with the EU for a press conference on Monday. Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, who backs a clean break with the EU after the end of the transition period in December 2020, said their actions were ""the last rearguard action to stop Brexit"". Hunt warns Johnson over customs comments MSPs urged to reject EU Withdrawal Bill Speaking at rice manufacturer Tilda's factory in Essex, Mr Miliband, former Lib Dem leader Sir Nick Clegg and Tory former education secretary Nicky Morgan urged Parliament to force the government's hand by voting for the UK to remain in some form of customs union as well as retaining full access to the single market. Mrs Morgan said the ""differing and irreconcilable"" views of ministers meant Parliament ""had to step up to the plate"". Urging MPs to resist ""siren voices"" arguing the UK could replicate existing economic benefits outside the customs union and single market, she said the UK was being asked to ""experiment"" with a new trade policy without any idea of its costs. Nicky Morgan said the referendum result was being wilfully distorted ""That is not a manifestation of democracy, it is a tyranny, a distortion of the referendum result and MPs should call it out,"" she said. Asked why after more than five years out of British politics, the public should listen to him, Mr Miliband said many of the complex, vital issues now being discussed simply did not feature in the Brexit referendum. ""I don't take the referendum result as the end of the story,"" he said. ""Democracy cannot be allowed to end on 23 June 2016, debate cannot be allowed to end."" Corbyn must change Brexit stance - Kinnock Brexit customs plan has 'flaws' - Gove Sir Nick Clegg said while Brexiteers ""parroted the language of global Britain"", their policies would result in the ""greatest introduction"" of trade barriers since World War Two. Earlier, Mr Miliband told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the move was about cross-party working in the national interest, not creating a new political movement or new centrist political party. Many Labour MPs, and some Tories, favour the so-called ""Norway model"" of remaining in the EEA - which is an economic grouping of all EU countries as well as Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland. EEA membership would see the UK retain full access to the EU's internal market of 300 million consumers in return for making financial contributions and accepting most EU laws. Free movement laws would also apply - so EU citizens could move to all EEA countries to work and live. The government says this would be counter to the EU referendum, which Mrs May has described as ""a vote to take control of our borders, laws and money"". Mr Miliband said EEA membership would allow the UK to have ""structured"" trade relations with the EU in goods and services, citing support from Norway for the UK to be a member. While the EU accounted for 40% of the UK's direct trade with the EU, Mr Miliband said that if you took into account third-party EU trade agreements with other countries, the figure was about 60%. ""Membership of the EEA, as what I would call a safe harbour for Britain after Brexit, is on the table for every MP and party leader,"" he said. Mr Miliband joined a growing chorus of senior Labour figures - including former Lord Kinnock - calling on Mr Corbyn to rethink his position ruling out the EEA option. ""If Jeremy Corbyn is not careful, he will be the midwife of a hard Brexit that will threaten the living standards of the very people that he says he wants to stand up to represent,"" he said. But Mr Rees-Mogg, who chairs the influential European Research Group of Conservative MPs, said it was a ""last-gasp effort"" by those who want the UK to stay in the EU. ""The Remainers are fighting their last rear-guard action to try and stop Brexit,"" he told LBC Radio. ""They're doing it in the House of Lords and there's this grouping that's come out today. If that doesn't succeed... then we're on to what the negotiation says what is going to be implemented, and that, I think, will make the prime minister's position much easier."" Theresa May is holding a series of meetings with Tory MPs in Downing Street to set out the two options for future customs arrangements proposed by the government. The CBI employers group, which backs remaining in a full customs union with the EU, warned that the issue needed to be resolved ""within days"". ""If we don't break the impasse on this customs decision, everybody will be affected - manufacturers, services companies, retailers,"" said its director Carolyn Fairbairn. ""An awful lot hangs on this now.""

"This video can not be played Lawyer Sulaiha Ali says victims of crime are being treated as criminals because of their immigration status More than half of UK police forces are handing over victims of crime to the Home Office for immigration enforcement, new figures show. One woman who was beaten by her partner was then herself arrested by police. There are fears the approach is stopping vulnerable people - including rape victims - reporting crimes, playing into the hands of traffickers. The Home Office said it would support vulnerable migrants ""regardless of their immigration status"". ""Victims of crime must be treated first and foremost as victims,"" a spokesperson said. The BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme asked 45 UK police forces, via a Freedom of Information request, if they referred victims and witnesses of crime to the Home Office for immigration enforcement. Twenty-seven said they did. Some gave a straight ""yes"", others had caveats such as ""not routinely"" or ""it's rare"". Three - including Police Scotland - said they did not, and the rest were unclear, did not reply or said they had no data. ""Sara"" came to the UK with her partner - a British citizen. But she says she was treated like a slave. ""He told me, 'That's why I brought you here, so you can cook and clean for me,'"" she explains. ""He beat me with a belt and a cable."" She was brought into the UK illegally, so she could not go to the police in case she was arrested - ""a common feature in all domestic violence and trafficking cases"", according to Sara's lawyer Sulaiha Ali, of Duncan Lewis Solicitors. Eventually, Sara tried to escape. She ran out on to the street, when her partner chased after her and beat her in front of a member of the public, who then called the police. They arrested the perpetrator and took Sara to hospital because of the severity of her injuries. Sara was arrested and taken to Yarl's Wood detention centre She was then taken to a hostel, where she was later arrested and sent to Yarl's Wood immigration removal centre to be deported. Ms Ali thinks Sara should never have been arrested at all. ""It's shocking to know that victims of crime are being seen and treated as criminals just because of their status."" Ms Ali has now stopped Sara's deportation order, and Sara has applied for asylum in the UK. But Ms Ali says she's doing ""quite bad"", and has not been given the support ""she is entitled to"" as a victim, because ""the focus has been completely on her immigration status"". Pragna Patel from Southall Black Sisters - which campaigns on the issue - says she is extremely worried that referring victims of crime for immigration enforcement is ""in conflict with the government's stated aim to protect all women from violence"". ""Since 2014, we've seen a steady rise in cases where the police have arrested women or reported women to the Home Office as potential illegals rather than deal with their reports of violence and rape."" She fears vulnerable women will be deterred from speaking out about the violence and abuse they have suffered because they are frightened of being arrested, detained and deported. Pragna Patel says there has been a rise in cases since 2014 Green Party leader Caroline Lucas told the Victoria Derbyshire programme she has heard of rape victims ""being afraid to come forward to report that rape, which means that the perpetrator is still at large"". She called for a ""firewall"" - a blocking of information between police operations and immigration officials - so the two do not become mixed up, and justice is not ""jeopardised"". Watch Catrin Nye's full filmon the Victoria Derbyshire programme's website. Last November, a case was uncovered in which a woman reported to the police that she had been kidnapped and raped over a six-month period. She was taken to a sexual assault centre by police, but then she was arrested. Guidance from the National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC) issued in December says that ""immediate arrest will not be made"" of victims of crime, relating to their immigration status, unless there is ""an immediate risk of harm to a specific individual"". Only three police forces said they were following this guidance. Former Ch Supt Dal Babu says it is ""easier"" for officers to send vulnerable people to a detention centre Former Ch Supt Dal Babu has called for more specific regulations for officers to follow. He said victims of crime ""were low-hanging fruit"" amid the government's hostile environment policy, which included immigration removal targets. ""These are vulnerable people... so it's much easier when a woman comes forward who has been raped to then say, 'We're investigating this', and go and arrest [her] and [she'll] be sent to a detention centre."" The NPCC said it was ""unequivocal that victims of crime should be treated as victims first and foremost. ""Each case is considered very carefully but there will be instances where police need to exchange information with the Home Office."" The Home Office said: ""When individuals are found to have no basis in the UK, we carefully consider the details of the case before taking an enforcement action."" Additional reporting by Leo Sands.

"This video can not be played Gaza's deadliest day of violence in years At least 52 Palestinians have been killed and 2,400 wounded by Israeli troops, Palestinian officials say, on the deadliest day of violence since the 2014 Gaza war. Palestinians have been protesting for weeks but deaths soared on the day the US opened its embassy in Jerusalem. Palestinians see this as clear US backing for Israeli rule over the whole city, whose eastern part they claim. But US President Donald Trump hailed the move in a video message. He told the dedication ceremony that it had been a ""long time coming"", adding: ""Israel is a sovereign nation with the right to determine its own capital but for many years we failed to acknowledge the obvious."" The day's events as they happened What makes Jerusalem so holy? The US, he added, remained ""committed to facilitating a lasting peace agreement"". There have been six weeks of protests at the Gaza border, dubbed the ""Great March of Return"" and led by Gaza's Islamist rulers Hamas. Hamas had always said it would step up the protests before Tuesday, when Palestinians hold their annual commemoration of what they call theNakbaor Catastrophe. Hundreds of thousands fled their homes or were displaced following the foundation of the Israeli state on 14 May 1948. Hundreds of people have been injured, according to Palestinian officials On Monday, the Israeli military said 40,000 Palestinians had taken part in ""violent riots"" at 13 locations along the Gaza Strip security fence. Palestinians hurled stones and incendiary devices while the Israeli military used snipers, as black smoke poured from burning tyres. The health ministry, run by Hamas, said children were among those killed. The Israeli military said it had killed three people trying to plant explosives near the security fence in Rafah. Aircraft and tanks had also targeted military positions belonging to Hamas in the northern Gaza Strip, it said. Israel says the protests are aimed at breaching the border and attacking Israeli communities nearby. There were also violent clashes between Israeli police and protesters who raised Palestinian flags outside the new embassy. Several protesters were detained. Feras Kilani, BBC Arabic, at the protests in Gaza Tuesday is expected to be a very big demonstration because it is a day known by the Palestinians as the ""Catastrophe"" that followed the creation of the state of Israel. Palestinians will go to bury the dozens of people killed on Monday and then they will come again to demonstrate. You can imagine the situation with all this anger, thousands of Palestinians will come here and will try to cross the fence to return to what they see as their land - what they do not see as Israel but as Palestine. It is expected to be bigger than Monday and more bloody. Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas condemned what he called Israeli ""massacres against our people"", and declared three days of mourning. Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu said: ""Every nation has the right to defend its borders. Hamas clearly says its intentions are to destroy Israel and sends thousands to break through the border for that end."" A number of Western nations including the UK called for restraint. EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said: ""We expect all to act with utmost restraint to avoid further loss of life"" Germany said Israel had the right to defend itself but should do so proportionately One of the strongest statements came from UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, who condemned the ""shocking killing of dozens, injury of hundreds by Israeli live fire"" Allow Twitter content?

A small interim embassy will start operating from Monday inside the existing US consulate building in Jerusalem. A larger site will be found later when the rest of the embassy moves from Tel Aviv. This video can not be played Donald Trump addresses the ceremony via videolink The opening ceremony was brought forward to coincide with the state of Israel's 70th anniversary. Mr Trump's daughter, Ivanka, and her husband Jared Kushner, who are both senior White House advisers, joined US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan for the ceremony. How did the world react to embassy move? Five key takeaways from Jerusalem decision After Ivanka Trump had unveiled the seal of the embassy, Mr Kushner said in his address: ""When President Trump makes a promise he keeps it... We have shown the world that the US can be trusted. We stand with our friends and allies."" Mr Kushner also referred to Mr Trump's withdrawal from the ""dangerous, flawed and one-sided Iran deal"", drawing applause from the guests. Mr Netanyahu said: ""What a glorious day. Remember this moment. This is history. President Trump, by recognising history, you have made history. All of us are deeply grateful."" Mahmoud Abbas condemned the embassy as a ""settlement in East Jerusalem"", saying that the US was ""no longer a mediator in the Middle East"". Arab League chief Ahmed Abul Gheit said it was ""shameful to see countries participating with the US and Israel in celebrating the former's embassy move to occupied Jerusalem in a clear and grave violation of international law"". The status of Jerusalem goes to the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Can the settlement issue be solved? The alternatives to a two-state solution Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem is not recognised internationally and, according to the 1993 Israel-Palestinian peace accords, the final status of Jerusalem is meant to be discussed in the latter stages of peace talks. Israel has occupied East Jerusalem since the 1967 Middle East war. It effectively annexed the sector, though this was not recognised by any countries until Mr Trump's declaration in December 2017. This video can not be played Why the ancient city of Jerusalem is so important Since 1967, Israel has built a dozen settlements, home to about 200,000 Jews, in East Jerusalem. These are considered illegal under international law, although Israel disputes this. Why do evangelicals support Trump on Jerusalem? Various countries once had embassies based in Jerusalem but many moved after Israel passed a law in 1980 formally making Jerusalem its capital. Why Jerusalem matters.

"This video can not be played Hundreds of people paid their respects outside Goodison Park Crowds of well-wishers have lined the streets in Liverpool to pay their respects to Alfie Evans. The 23-month-old, from Bootle in Merseyside, had a degenerative brain condition and died on 28 April. His case drew international attention when it became the centre of a High Court legal battle over his care. People gathered outside Everton's Goodison Park stadium as the procession passed following a private funeral service. Alfie's father Tom Evans is a keen supporter of the Premier League club and had spoken of his hopes to take his son to watch the Blues in action. A vigil was held on Wednesday on what would have been Alfie's second birthday As the hearse passed, small soldiers could be seen on the side of the white coffin, and the words ""warrior"" and ""our hero"" were written in white flowers on the roof. The crowd applauded and some threw flowers as the procession made its way slowly up the road. Although the funeral service is private, crowds have gathered outside Everton's Goodison Park stadium Kayleigh Thomas wants to show support for the family of Alfie Evans Ch Insp Chris Gibson, from Merseyside Police, said Alfie's parents Tom and Kate ""continue to thank the community"". Who was Alfie Evans? Kayleigh Thomas, 27, from Norris Green, attended with her five-year-old daughter Esme. She said: ""Alfie's Army are always here and always will be to support Tom and Kate and the rest of the family."" Tributes have been placed outside Goodison Park since Alfie's death Alfie, who was born in May 2016, was first admitted to Liverpool's Alder Hey Hospital in December of that year after suffering seizures, and was a patient there until his death. He had been in a semi-vegetative state for more than a year before his life support was withdrawn in April. The crowd applauded and some threw flowers as the procession passed Goodison Park, home to Everton FC Several hundred mourners and supporters of Alfie Evans lined Walton Road, outside Goodison Park, to pay their respects to the toddler whose tragic story had captured their hearts. Some wore T-shirts with a picture of Alfie and the words: ""The boy who brought the world together."" As Alfie's funeral procession made its way slowly up the road, the crowd applauded and some people threw flowers. Some people wept as the procession passed by while others simply waved their goodbyes. Alfie's parents' campaign against the decision saw them clash with doctors over his treatment. They lost all legal challenges to a court ruling allowing the hospital to withdraw ventilation. Alfie's parents Kate James and Tom Evans had contested the hospital's decision The case attracted widespread attention including from the Pope, who tweeted his support for the family.Alfie's parents had also wanted to fly their son to Italyfor further treatment.

"It's been the stuff of tabloid dreams - the exploits of holidaymakers and the reps on Club 18-30 holidays. From a low-key start in the 1960s, it became notorious, embracing that image with risquÃ© advertising slogans. Now, Thomas Cook, which took over the brand in 1998, says it is considering its future, including a possible sale. It wants to concentrate on its Cook's Club brand, which it launched last month and which it believes is of more appeal to its millennial customers. The concept is centred on its own-brand hotels, which can accommodate 300-400 guests and features such attractions as poolside DJs and a sharper focus on food for, a spokesman told the BBC, the ""Instagram generation"". Have millennials killed off Club 18-30? Club 18-30 was founded in the 1960s to offer package holidays targeted at young singles and couples to travel without families or children. The first destination was Lloret de Mar on the Costa Brava. In 1973, it was bought out by the management, the first of a series of changes of ownership. Its controversial, playful image kept it in the public eye throughout the 1990s and 2000s. Advertising slogans from the time included  ""It's not all sex, sex, sex. There's a bit of sun and sea as well"". Young, impressionable and on my first package holiday I chose a last-minute 18-30 with friends to Corfu. We'd worked all summer to pay for the trip and a week in the sun with plenty of fun sounded ideal. The reps were all focused on making sure you had ""fun""'. That meant lots of bars, clubs, free drinks and games. I was terrified. But somehow managed to maintain the participation level to end up in the final of a game where the girls had to move an egg up the inside of a bloke's trousers and then down the other side. Only one of the eggs was hard boiled. We lost, and I never took another 18-30. ""While Club 18-30 is easily the most-recognised brand in this sector, it is a tired and tarnished brand - people who went on its first holidays in the 1970s are now in their 70s!,"" said Simon Calder, travel editor at the Independent. ""'Hosting the wildest party holidays' (one of its marketing slogans) from Magaluf to Bulgaria is no longer especially popular with local authorities, who are cracking down on organised bar crawls. ""Thomas Cook is moving steadily upmarket, ditching cheap and nasty accommodation in favour of sophisticated all-inclusive properties."" In 2002, ITV made the programme Club Reps, based on the life of the workers. Full of salacious details, it is said to have boosted bookings significantly. In 2005, Channel 5 showed a documentary called the Curse of Club 18-30. The company was not amused and complained to Ofcom. Although it is called Club 18-30, the actual target age range is 17-35.

"The NHS is ""one of our country's greatest treasures"", Prince William will say on Monday in a video message to those working in the health service. In a special recording to be played at an awards ceremony for NHS staff, the prince will say they are the ""most wonderful thing"" about the service. He will describe their ""skill, care, and dedication"" as ""inspirational"". The event, honouring staff and the public, coincides with the 70th anniversary of the health service. The ""hero doctor"" award will go to Martin Griffiths, a trauma surgeon who saved the life of the first person to be stabbed during the London Bridge terror attack. By chance, he had also performed life-saving heart surgery on the victim's father several years earlier. London Bridge doctor: Trump knife crime comments 'ridiculous' Photos show healthcare before the NHS NHS needs 'Â£50bn extra by 2030' And a sexual health worker credited with uncovering the widespread grooming of underage girls in Rochdale will also receive an award. Sara Rowbotham's evidence helped lead to the conviction of nine abusers. She is to receive special recognition for her work with vulnerable children. The Duchess of Cornwall is expected to attend the event to present a special award, organisers said. Other guests include Sir Tom Jones, Dame Shirley Bassey, Jamie Oliver and Paul O'Grady, who will host the ceremony. Elsewhere, the ""young fundraising hero"" award will go to15-year-old Freya Lewis - a survivor of the Manchester Arena bombing,who helped raise Â£40,000 for the Royal Manchester Children's Hospital, where she was treated for serious injuries. This video can not be played Freya Lewis was in a wheelchair for three months after the Manchester attack In a video message played to the audience, Prince William will say: ""The National Health Service is one of our country's greatest treasures, and something we should all be immensely proud of. ""Perhaps the most wonderful thing about the NHS is its people. The skill, care, and dedication that they provide every day is truly inspirational."" He will also ""pay tribute to every member of NHS staff, and the wonderful volunteers who do so much to support them"". ""We owe you all a huge thank you.""

"Once built, the UK will have seven Astute hunter-killer submarines The defence secretary is expected to announce a Â£2.5bn investment in the UK's nuclear submarine programme. Under the plans, an Astute hunter-killer submarine will be built costing Â£1.5bn, and Â£960m will go towards completing a fleet of four nuclear-armed Dreadnought submarines. Gavin Williamson will say it is part of a commitment to secure the UK ""from intensifying threats"". The Ministry of Defence says the deal will help to sustain thousands of jobs. 50 years of nuclear submarines on the Clyde Mr Williamson will announce the plans during a visit to defence giant BAE Systems' shipyard in Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria. He will say the Astute submarine - which will complete the Royal Navy's seven-strong fleet of hunter-killer attack subs - will be called Agincourt. The deal with BAE will also help with the second phase of construction for the UK's Dreadnought submarines. While at the factory, Mr Williamson will unveil a plaque and officially open a new Â£100m sub-construction building which will be used to outfit and test the submarines. He will say: ""This multibillion-pound investment in our nuclear submarines shows our unwavering commitment to keeping the UK safe and secure from intensifying threats. ""Agincourt will complete the Royal Navy's seven-strong fleet of hunter-killer attack subs, the most powerful to ever enter British service, whilst our nuclear deterrent is the ultimate defence against the most extreme dangers we could possibly face."" He will also stress the importance of the boost for Barrow - ""the heart of sub-building in this country"". ""Today's news supports 8,000 BAE Systems' submarine jobs, as well as thousands more in the supply chain, protecting prosperity and providing opportunity right across the country,"" Mr Williamson will say.

"Two people were still in the plane when it crashed The boy who was killed in a light aircraft crash in the Republic of Ireland was the son of one of the parachutists who jumped from the plane a short time before. The pilot of the plane was also killed in the crash in County Offaly. GardaÃ­ (Irish police) said the aircraft, which had 16 parachutists on board, took off from Clonbullogue Airfield at 14:45 BST. All 16 jumped from the plane, but it crashed in bogland shortly afterwards. It has been reported that the pilot was from the UK. The bodies were recovered from the wreckage on Sunday night. The light aircraft took off from Clonbullogue Airfield on Sunday afternoon The Air Accident Investigation Unit has confirmed it is investigating the circumstances of the crash. GardaÃ­ have called in the peat digging company Bord na MÃ³na to assist them with large track machinery as they try to recover the single engine Cessna Caravan aircraft. Speaking on RTÃ radio's Morning Ireland programme, Offaly County Councillor Martin O'Reilly said that the seriousness of the incident is only just setting in. He said: ""There was a sense of disbelief, shock and horror at such an incident in our area, particularly associated with the parachute club. We're only waking up to this shocking news and it's only setting in, how serious it's been."" Mr O'Reilly said the area the plane crashed into gets quite a lot of footfall with walkers and cyclists. ""You'd have a lot of people going out to the club doing fundraisers, parachute jumps for local charities and stuff. And there was never an incident, never has been an incident,"" he said.

"The teenager called her win 'astonishing' Teenage pianist Lauren Zhang has won the BBC's prestigious Young Musician competition, just days before she starts her GCSEs. The 16-year-old took the title after playing Prokofiev's challenging Piano Concerto No 2, accompanied the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra. Kerry Andrew, chair of the judging panel, said the performance ""left us all breathless"". Lauren beat cellist Maxim Calver and sax player Rob Burton to win the title. ""I'm astonished!"" she said after receiving the prize. ""I'm pleasantly surprised and I can't believe it. ""The journey, right from the start of the competition, has been incredible."" Lauren said she 'really enjoyed' her performance in Birmingham's Symphony Hall Born in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Lauren started learning piano at the age of four, and is also an accomplished violinist. The musician moved to the UK in 2010, bringing her family with her, after winning a place at the Royal Birmingham Conservatoire. She won the BBC's competition on home turf - having previously played in Birmingham's Symphony Hall at school concerts. BBC Young Musician - official site Although this was her first time playing with a professional orchestra, conductor Mark Wigglesworth had nothing but praise for the youngster. ""When you meet Lauren she seems... I wouldn't say 'shy', but controlled within herself and very confident about her own personality,"" he said. ""Then you hear her play and you discover this incredible depth and range of thought and imagination. That's an extraordinary combination."" This video can not be played Get to know Young Musician finalists Max, Rob and Lauren Lauren said she chose Prokofiev's second piano concerto because it balanced ""lyrical, elegant"" melodies with moments that are more ""grotesque or bizarre"". In addition, she confessed, it neatly fitted into the final's the 30-minute time limit. Not that it was an easy piece to learn: ""I really had to practise it quite a few times before I could play without stopping in the middle because it was just so difficult,"" she said. Son of a joiner becomes UK's richest man British Gas owner loses 110,000 accounts Should we all become early risers? But speaking on BBC Four after the performance, Lauren said she ""really enjoyed playing"" the piece. The BBC Young Musician competition began in 1978, and previous winners  - including Nicola Benedetti, Freddy Kempf and Sheku Kanneh-Mason - have gone on to achieve worldwide success. Having taken the 2018 title, Lauren will now perform at BBC Music'sBiggest Weekend in Coventryon 28 May, and also at a specialBBC Young Musician 40th anniversaryconcert at the BBC Proms on 15 July at the Royal Albert Hall in London. She'll have to juggle these commitments with her exams, which start on Tuesday with a French paper. ""I think it's quite stressful juggling GCSEs with this competition,"" she said.

"This video can not be played Dame Tessa Jowell: From social worker to London 2012 The prime minister says she hopes government funding for brain cancer research will create a ""lasting legacy"" for Baroness Jowell, who died on Saturday aged 70. Theresa May confirmed the government would double investment for research into tackling the disease, to Â£40m. There will be a national roll-out in England of a ""gold standard dye"" test to identify the disease. But Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt told the BBC: ""We need to do more."" Speaking to the Today programme, he said: ""We haven't had many good quality research projects on brain cancer, and this is what we're trying to put right with this new fund that we're announcing today."" Charity Cancer Research UK is also contributing Â£25m to the fund, known as the Dame Tessa Jowell Brain Cancer Research Mission. The UK will also host an annual global conference named after the politician. The annual Tessa Jowell global symposium is aimed at bringing together clinicians, scientists, and academics together to discuss brain cancer treatment. Obituary: Dame Tessa Jowell Tributes to 'inspirational' politician Dame Tessa first to give data to medical database In the UK 11,400 people are diagnosed with a brain tumour each year, with only 14% of sufferers surviving the disease for 10 or more years. Currently, the gold standard dye test is only used by half of brain cancer centres in England, but this will now be introduced across the country. Dame Tessa helped bring the Olympic Games to London in 2012 Mrs May said: ""Baroness Tessa Jowell faced her illness with dignity and courage, and it was a privilege to host her in Downing Street recently to discuss what more we can do to tackle brain cancer. ""I hope that the actions we are taking now and in the future to improve care and research for those confronting a terrible disease will form part of the lasting legacy of an inspirational woman."" Lady Jowell, who held cabinet positions in the Blair and Brown governments, was diagnosed with brain cancer in May 2017. This video can not be played Tessa Jowell gets a minute-long standing ovation in the House of Lords The politician, who was also a member of the House of Lords, opened up about her illness earlier this year and called for adaptive trials. If one treatment was not working, she argued, patients should be able to try something different - even if it hadn't been fully tested. The risks, she said, look different if ""the clock is ticking against you"".

"There has been a sharp rise in the number of children under 11 referred for mental health treatment by schools in the last four years, figures show. Data obtained by children's charity the NSPCC shows that schools in England have made a total of 123,713 referrals for specialist help since 2014-15. But more than half of these came from primary schools. The youngest child referred for help was three years old. The government says its reforms will transform services for children. The figures were released under Freedom of Information laws to the NSPCC by 53 of the 66 health trusts known to provide mental health support to children. Issues children were referred for included depression and anxiety, sometimes these were so severe that it can lead them to the brink of suicide, said Esther Rantzen founder and president of NSPCC's Childline. In 2017-18, some 18,870 children aged under 11 were referred for specialist support. This was a rise of 5,183, or more than a third, on those referred in 2014-15. This video can not be played Child mental health: When it feels like no-one is listening The statistics also reveal that one-third of those referred to Child Adolescent Mental Health Services (Camhs) were declined help. The NSPCC said increased demand for support was placing the system under real pressure, and jeopardising the well-being of thousands of children. Its chief executive Peter Wanless said: ""Our research shows schools are increasingly referring children for specialist mental health treatment, often when the child is at crisis point."" The struggle of waiting for mental health support Counselling young 'could help economy' Sarah Hannafin, senior policy adviser at the National Association of Head Teachers, said: ""More pupils are suffering from mental health issues and there is much more awareness in schools for spotting potential problems and intervening early to get support. ""However, more than a third of referrals are not accepted - schools have referred these pupils because they are concerned about their mental health and know that the child needs more specialist support than could (and should) be offered by school staff. ""However, many of these children are not meeting the thresholds set by Camhs - many are concerned about how high these thresholds are. ""The other concern is about what support those children can then get if they have been turned down by Camhs."" Student mental health 'failing a generation' More workers ask for mental health help A government spokeswoman said they had pledged Â£1.7bn to young people's mental health and wellbeing. ""Making sure children and young people get the right support when they need it is imperative,"" she said. ""That is why are allocating Â£300 million, over and above the additional Â£1.4bn being invested in specialist services, to provide more support linked to schools. ""This includes new mental health support teams to provide trained mental health workers to work closely with schools -including primary schools - to provide quicker support to children. ""We know we need to do more which is why we have extended our schools and NHS link pilot to deliver training in 20 more areas of the country this year.

"A spate of attacks blamed on militant Islamists has rocked Indonesia A suicide bombing at a police headquarters in the Indonesian city of Surabaya on Monday was carried out by a family of five riding on two motorbikes, police say. It came afteranother family carried out bomb attacks on three churches on Sunday. Police blamed an Islamic State-inspired network. An eight-year-old daughter survived the latest attack, police say. Indonesia is the world's most populous Muslim-majority country. The archipelago, home to 260 million people, has seen a resurgence of Islamist militancy in recent years but the scale of the attacks in Surabaya has raised fresh concerns about the potency of jihadist networks. Video footage of the latest attack on the police headquarters shows two motorbikes approaching a checkpoint just before the blast. Six civilians and four police officers were injured, the authorities say. The young girl who survived had been wedged between her mother and father on the motorbike as they carried out the attack. CCTV footage shows her stumbling around after the blast. Parents who bring their children to die Why is Indonesia a target for IS militants? Sent out to die: The young women used in militant attacks Indonesia was on high alert after bombings on Sunday by a single family targeted three churches in Surabaya, the capital of East Java province. The mother targeted one church alongside her two daughters, aged nine and 12, while the father and two sons attacked two other churches. Indonesian police released this picture of the family they said was responsible for Sunday's series of attacks The incident represented the first time a female suicide bomber had successfully carried out an attack, national police chief Tito Karnavian said. A 28-year-old woman had planned to bomb the Presidential Palace last year but was caught and jailed, he added. The authorities originally said the family of six were among hundreds of Indonesians who had returned from conflict-hit Syria but have since said the family did not actually travel there. The coordinated attacks killed 18 people, including the bombers, and injured more than 40. They were the deadliest bombings in Indonesia in more than a decade. Inside the home of Indonesia's most notorious IS militant More on Indonesia Police say the father, Dita Oepriarto, was the head of the local branch of Jemaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD), an Indonesian IS-inspired network. Six members of the same family carried out a series of attacks on Sunday: 1. Two teenaged sons rode motorcycles into Santa Maria Catholic Church and detonated explosives at 07:30 local time (00:30 GMT) 2. The father drove a bomb-laden car at Surabaya Centre Pentecostal Church at 07:35 local time 3. A mother, with her two daughters, carried out a bomb attack on Diponegoro Indonesian Christian Church a few minutes later There was another suspected terror-linked incident on Sunday night: 4. A bomb exploded at Rusunawa Wonocolo flats, Sidoarjo regency at around 21:00 local time A second family carried out an attack on Monday: 5. The family of five rode motorbikes to a checkpoint at Surabaya police headquarters and detonated bombs at 08:50 local time The bomb that exploded on Sunday night in an apartment killed three members of a family who police said may have been planning an attack and had connections with Oepriarto. Pipe bombs were found. Separately, police said on Monday that they had arrested six people plotting attacks in Surabaya, the Jakarta Post reported. President Joko Widodo has described the attacks as ""cowardly, undignified and inhumane"" and said he will push through a long-awaited anti-terrorism bill if parliament does not pass it. The bill has faced criticism from human rights groups, but defenders say it is needed to prosecute militants returning from the Middle East. ""There will be no compromise in taking action on the ground to stop terrorism,"" he said. Officials said police, backed by military forces, would increase security across the country. This video can not be played Sunday's deadly bombings shocked Indonesia In Australia, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said the nature of Sunday's attack - involving an entire family - ""almost beggars belief"". ""These people are the worst of the worst. They are threatening civilised nations, they're threatening civilised way of life. They're threatening people's harmony and religion. They are debasing and defaming Islam, as President Widodo has often said."" A burnt-out car in front of one of the bombed churches in Surabaya The South East Asian country has long struggled with Islamist militancy.Indonesia's worst ever terror attack was in Bali in 2002, when 202 people - mostly foreigners - were killed in an attack on a tourist nightlife district. That attack was carried out by the Jemaah Islamiah (JI) militant network and prompted a sustained crackdown on militants. The first attack claimed by IS in Indonesia took place in January 2016, when four civilians and four attackers were killed in a series of explosions and shootings in central Jakarta. IS-inspired groups have since mostly carried out ""amateurish"" plots but the attacks in Surabaya suggest better planning and a higher level of ""technical proficiency"", Zachary Abuza of the National War College in Washington DC told the BBC. The use of children in the attacks was ""absolutely unprecedented"" in the region, he said, and speaks to the ""ideological indoctrination"" of JAD. By BBC Monitoring â¢ JAD is a local network of Indonesian militants who have pledged allegiance to IS â¢ The group was formed in 2015 following a merger of several militant factions run by influential Indonesian cleric and convicted terrorist Aman Abdurrahman â¢ Abdurrahman, also known as Oman Rochman, is serving a nine-year prison sentence but is said to manage his followers, conduct recruitment and spread IS propaganda from behind bars â¢ JAD campaigns for a caliphate system across Indonesia and says it is ""justified in using violence"" to do so.

"The NHS is ""one of our country's greatest treasures"", Prince William will say on Monday in a video message to those working in the health service. In a special recording to be played at an awards ceremony for NHS staff, the prince will say they are the ""most wonderful thing"" about the service. He will describe their ""skill, care, and dedication"" as ""inspirational"". The event, honouring staff and the public, coincides with the 70th anniversary of the health service. The ""hero doctor"" award will go to Martin Griffiths, a trauma surgeon who saved the life of the first person to be stabbed during the London Bridge terror attack. By chance, he had also performed life-saving heart surgery on the victim's father several years earlier.

"This video can not be played Dame Tessa Jowell: From social worker to London 2012 The prime minister says she hopes government funding for brain cancer research will create a ""lasting legacy"" for Baroness Jowell, who died on Saturday aged 70. Theresa May confirmed the government would double investment for research into tackling the disease, to Â£40m. There will be a national roll-out in England of a ""gold standard dye"" test to identify the disease. But Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt told the BBC: ""We need to do more."" Speaking to the Today programme, he said: ""We haven't had many good quality research projects on brain cancer, and this is what we're trying to put right with this new fund that we're announcing today."" Charity Cancer Research UK is also contributing Â£25m to the fund, known as the Dame Tessa Jowell Brain Cancer Research Mission. The UK will also host an annual global conference named after the politician. The annual Tessa Jowell global symposium is aimed at bringing together clinicians, scientists, and academics together to discuss brain cancer treatment. Obituary: Dame Tessa Jowell Tributes to 'inspirational' politician Dame Tessa first to give data to medical database In the UK 11,400 people are diagnosed with a brain tumour each year, with only 14% of sufferers surviving the disease for 10 or more years. Currently, the gold standard dye test is only used by half of brain cancer centres in England, but this will now be introduced across the country. Dame Tessa helped bring the Olympic Games to London in 2012 Mrs May said: ""Baroness Tessa Jowell faced her illness with dignity and courage, and it was a privilege to host her in Downing Street recently to discuss what more we can do to tackle brain cancer. ""I hope that the actions we are taking now and in the future to improve care and research for those confronting a terrible disease will form part of the lasting legacy of an inspirational woman."" Lady Jowell, who held cabinet positions in the Blair and Brown governments, was diagnosed with brain cancer in May 2017. This video can not be played Tessa Jowell gets a minute-long standing ovation in the House of Lords The politician, who was also a member of the House of Lords, opened up about her illness earlier this year and called for adaptive trials. If one treatment was not working, she argued, patients should be able to try something different - even if it hadn't been fully tested. The risks, she said, look different if ""the clock is ticking against you"".

"This video can not be played Surabaya is in shock over the deadly bombings A family of six who carried out three church bombings in Indonesia had returned from Syria, police say. The Islamic State group has claimed the attacks, which killed at least 13 people on Sunday. A mother and two daughters blew themselves up at a church, while the father and two sons targeted two others in Indonesia's second city, Surabaya. National police chief Tito Karnavian said they belonged to an IS-inspired network, Jemaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD). Police say the family were among hundreds of Indonesians who had returned from Syria, where IS has been fighting government forces. No details were given about the family's alleged involvement in that conflict. The bombings are the deadliest in Indonesia in more than a decade, and also left more than 40 people injured. Visiting the scene of one of the attacks, President Joko Widodo described them as ""barbaric"", adding that he had ordered police to ""look into and break up networks of perpetrators"". Why is Indonesia a target for militants? Inside the home of Indonesia's most notorious IS militant Sent out to die: The young women used in militant attacks Police identified the father as Dita Oepriarto, saying he was the head of a local JAD cell. He reportedly dropped off his wife, Puji Kuswati, and their two daughters at Diponegoro Indonesian Christian Church, where they blew themselves up. The girls - aged 9 and 12 - had bombs strapped to them, as did their mother. Oepriarto then drove off, launching his own bomb-laden car into the grounds of Surabaya Centre Pentecostal Church, police said. The sons - aged 16 and 18 - rode motorcycles into Santa Maria Catholic Church, and detonated explosives they were carrying. It was their attack that came first, at around 07:30 local time (00:30 GMT). The other two attacks followed five minutes apart, police said. A security guard told the Associated Press news agency that the woman had arrived at the Diponegoro church carrying two bags, and forced her way inside ignoring the guards. ""Suddenly, she hugged a civilian, then [the bomb] exploded,"" said the eyewitness, who identified himself as Antonius. A burnt-out car in front of one of the bombed churches in Surabaya Later on Sunday, another bomb exploded at an apartment complex in Surabaya, killing three people, according to AFP news agency. East Java's police chief, Mahfud Arifin, said that those killed at the apartment were the perpetrators, not victims. It is not yet known if this bombing was connected to the other attacks. Also on Sunday, police said they killed four suspected members of JAD in Cianjur, in West Java province, and arrested two others. On Monday morning, another blast struck a police station in Surabaya. Police said it was a vehicle bomb and that some officers had been injured. Indonesian President Joko Widodo (R) visited the bomb sites on Sunday This appears to be the worst attack linked to IS in Indonesia. The group claimed its first attack in the country in 2016, when four civilians were killed in explosions and shootings in the capital Jakarta. It has also claimed other attacks, including one in a high-security prison near Jakarta which killed five members of security forces earlier this month. But the country's deadliest jihadist attacks predate IS. In 2002, over 200 people were killed in two bombings carried out by al-Qaeda-linked militants on the island of Bali, a popular tourist destination. In May 2005, bomb blasts killed 22 on the island of Sulawesi. Less than six months later, a suicide bombing in Bali killed 20. The BBC's Rebecca Henschke in Jakarta says Indonesia had been widely praised for its anti-terrorism crackdown since then, but the rise of IS overseas has invigorated the country's loosely constituted jihadi networks.

" I am quite a bright, colourful person. I try to be enthusiastic and funny. I don’t know if I am actually funny, but I do try. I’m quite an  expressive person, not very neat, not much of a perfectionist. My image shows this - it's quite messy. But I know that in the privacy of my own brain there is a lot more going on. I am quite private with my emotions, that’s why there is a big, ugly circle in the middle of my brain. There is a lot of stuff going on in there that people don’t know about, which I wanted to represent. It’s my own struggle and something I have always dealt with, but it also forms a lot of my outward personality. So there is a darkness, but it helps me to be more colourful and cheerful. I’ve always pulled through on my own, or other people have helped me without knowing that they did. I don’t see the need to burden others with it if I don’t have to. I have suffered from depression in the past. It’s not something I expected to happen - it just suddenly hit me. One day I started to feel very tired and wanted to stay in bed for the whole day. And then it lasted for about two years. Most people take mental health for granted. It's only when you get sick or some life event hits you that you really understand what it means. When I was depressed, I lost all interest in doing things. It took me about five years to come out of it. In the picture I have tried to put a mask in front of my face. I'm a receptionist and I tend to get a lot of sales calls. Even though I get annoyed, I need to pretend to be nice - like wearing a mask. I stayed in the dark for so long. Now that I am out of it, I try to be colourful. I never know when the depression will come back to hit me. I’ve realised I am quite a conflicted person, which I tried to reflect with the black and white in my image. It’s like there are two very different people within me - but I'm as much one as I am the other. One part of me wants to be free and detached and to not exist really - to be invisible in the world and free from responsibility, to travel and disappear. The other half wants stability with relationships and future. I think I put too much pressure on myself [to resolve this conflict]. There is blue in the image because I think it's the most beautiful colour. It's quite a sad colour, but it’s a beautiful sadness. It's like the sea and the sky, the two things that you can’t see the end of - they are so vast. I've been thinking about my mental health recently, as I'm getting a new therapist. It's a big part of my life. I have psychosis and suffer from delusions, and that kind of thing. But it’s not something that generally I'm really bothered about. I also have OCD - I have to do things a number of times because I feel something bad will happen if I don't. If I walk down steps and find I have to miss every even-numbered step, I know it's going to be a bad day. The OCD has changed my life a lot, but I've learnt to ignore other things, such as the hallucinations. Some days are worse than others. I have social anxiety, so sometimes I will avoid social situations where I know there will be a lot of people. I was assigned female at birth, but I identify as a man. I knew when I was 11 but I didn't come out until I was about 15. If you come out in your teens, people say, “You should have known sooner”. But if you come out as a child they claim that you can't know already. My mum says she is still grieving because her daughter died. I still like to do feminine things, like put on make up. My parents find this very confusing, though. When I came out, they didn't believe me, so I had to dress more manly and do typically manly things so they would accept it. My mental health has caused a huge disaster, and now I am trying to build myself back up. The pictures on my image are basically little references to my life. Most of the drawing is about my daughters. I drew a dice because everything seems like a bit of a gamble I’ve got bipolar disorder. The way it works is that things start whizzing around your head very fast and you start getting lots of ideas and making connections. It’s great when there is a peak to it, but not if it goes further and you make a connection when there isn't one. It can send you a bit crazy. When I didn’t know that I had it, I was going up the wall. Being a bit up and down mood-wise means I don’t really suit a nine-to-five job. Art and music suit my personality. Bipolar is one of those things you have to come to terms with. I found out as much as I could about it, which meant I could control it better. I was on lithium, but you can only be on it for so long. I could feel some differences in my body, and what it was doing to me, so I worked out different strategies to cope with the bipolar. Nowadays I am very good at coping with it. I run all the time which gets rid of all excess energy, as well as keeping me fit. You have to look out for signs of the bipolar. For example, once I start being entertaining, like making people laugh at the pub, it feels great. But that can be the start of the high. It can feel fantastic - except it just all starts getting out of hand. That’s when it can start getting irritating for people. My image shows a car. I worked in the taxi trade for about 30 years - it was what I lived for. I liked it because I would chat to people - hear their stories. Then I became ill, with depression mainly. It was kind of downhill from there. Then my wife died. The last two years, I did everything for her. In the past four months, I haven't wanted to see anybody. I don't want to go out. I'm  just looking at four walls - within those walls are  memories. What do you do? Pack them in a suitcase and forget about them? You can't, you just have to carry on. People say I am strong, but I'm not. I've had counselling but it hasn't made a difference. With time it gets easier, but you don't forget. They are still there and always will be. Today I had to go to the opticians around the corner to ask if they could stop sending letters to my wife. Every time I get mail for her, it brings it back. Even on the good days, I feel as though I'm not getting anywhere. But a good day is better than the bad day you had the day before. It's not a quick fix. But only I can make the changes I drew a rose, because it got complexity and it's quite beautiful. The red rose speaks a lot about love if you give it to somebody. I think it says I am a very loving person. I am a community mental health worker. It is a very rewarding job for me and I feel privileged to help people with complex lives. It can take more than eight months now to get a medical assessment and to see a psychiatric doctor. It’s really cruel, these people are really unwell and they need immediate help. And it’s just waiting and waiting, and they become so anxious. They even go in and out of A&E because they have a panic attack and things like that, but there is no quick way to see a psychiatric doctor. GPs refer people to CBT therapy and self-help groups, but there is a 12-week wait for that. When someone's first language isn't English, it's even more difficult for them. In our South Asian, Bangladeshi cultures, it's thought women should be multi-functional and not get ill. They should just get on with life. Mental health isn't really recognised. Women have control in their house - financial control for example. But often don't have the education or the freedom to earn that money for themselves. Freedom is a very big thing that plays on their minds. I am not embarrassed like I used to be [about showing my emotions]. If you cry, just let it come out. When I lost my dad, I used to suddenly burst into tears when I saw someone who looked like him on the street. My dad was always a big part of my life. He always wanted to help vulnerable people - whether in Manchester or Bangladesh. That’s what I am doing. I am not one for labels when talking about mental health issues, they are so unique to an individual it's difficult to have a specific name for a thing. Depression to one person means something else to another.But I’ve had issues with that kind of stuff, with anger stuff. I'm a bottler - I bottle things up. My image has four main elements. With the waves, I’ve spent a lot of time sailing, and when you're out on the water you realise how small and insignificant you are in the world. It's nice to think how little you matter, so you can just enjoy what you are doing. The scales are the biggest representative symbol. It’s weighing up how much pain I would get from doing one thing versus how much I would gain in the long run. It’s an uncomfortable set of scales to be holding - and if I could drop them, I would. The dragon represents my escapism. I am one of those people who plays Dungeons and Dragons and fantasy stuff. Rather than having to think about important things in reality, it creates a different world where you can do whatever you want. I would be lying if I said I am a fundamentally happy person. I am a pessimist and I don’t like it. I've got Parkinson’s disease. It was a relief to be told, because when you put a name to it, it makes sense. I am scared about the future. There is not much of it. At 82 - I didn’t think I’d live this long. There are more memories behind which are excellent. When I go to bed at night, I sleep solid for hours and I sometimes have some lovely dreams despite the drugs I am on. I’d like to just go and sit on a mountain in Tibet. Just watching the sunset and the sunrise. The people in Tibet usually look after the elderly. After my husband died I had a mental breakdown. I had no children or family here. Social services were involved and they told me they would not be able to help me. I felt very angry with them. I got all my stuff into my living room and wanted to set the house on fire. One of my neighbours then knocked on my door and asked me what I was doing. I live alone and I do get scared, but I feel a lot better than I did before. I want to go to visit Bangladesh, but I don’t know what I would do if I went back there permanently. When I see ladies that are really stressed out, I tell them to pray to Allah. If you are stressed inside your house, get out and talk to somebody. I'm an aspiring broadcaster and musician. For the past six years, I’ve been involved in a project on the weather and tracking storms. Since the new year, I have been quite depressed. I guess I don’t feel as though I'm performing as well as I should in what I am doing I had a difficult time at school. I left at 14 and was home-schooled until college. I struggled because of various mental health issues that I had at the time - mainly depression and anxiety. When I was younger, it was social and communication issues. But I guess I’ve got over that - mainly through broadcasting. I feel quite isolated and lonely, because I just don’t really identify with many people within my age group. Sometimes I might go for a night out, but I don’t do it religiously like people my age do. I guess I am just a lonely soul, but there we go. In my image, there is a tiny umbrella above my head and a big rainstorm that completely dwarfs the umbrella - which I think is very apt for my situation in general. I am quite a rational thinker - but thought it was quite ironic to spell “rationale” wrong intentionally. The white stuff around the musical note is white noise. In my line of work, I have to deal with a lot of white noise. White noise to me is also the conflict that can be created within a group of people. The brown stuff above my shoulder is where my worst thoughts usually are. At two points in the past three years, I have had an existential crisis where I was just worried about the whole big picture of the world and the universe. There is also a representation of my mismanaged and hopeless romanticism - which is going on at the moment. The yellow wall is my defence area. If people are rude about me, I am usually mentally strong enough to block it off. But sometimes the wall can drop away a little bit, and I can get triggered into depression. The blocks at the bottom resemble the workload I have at the moment - brick by brick. It’s completely disorganised to the point where a task on my to-do list is to write a to-do list. The number one represents the position I'd like to be in my field, and the number 10 is how I usually feel. Built with Shorthand",Negative,1.7148882e-07
"This video can not be played Gaza's deadliest day of violence in years At least 52 Palestinians have been killed and 2,400 wounded by Israeli troops, Palestinian officials say, on the deadliest day of violence since the 2014 Gaza war. Palestinians have been protesting for weeks but deaths soared on the day the US opened its embassy in Jerusalem. Palestinians see this as clear US backing for Israeli rule over the whole city, whose eastern part they claim. But US President Donald Trump hailed the move in a video message. He told the dedication ceremony that it had been a ""long time coming"", adding: ""Israel is a sovereign nation with the right to determine its own capital but for many years we failed to acknowledge the obvious."" The day's events as they happened What makes Jerusalem so holy? The US, he added, remained ""committed to facilitating a lasting peace agreement"". There have been six weeks of protests at the Gaza border, dubbed the ""Great March of Return"" and led by Gaza's Islamist rulers Hamas. Hamas had always said it would step up the protests before Tuesday, when Palestinians hold their annual commemoration of what they call theNakbaor Catastrophe. Hundreds of thousands fled their homes or were displaced following the foundation of the Israeli state on 14 May 1948. Hundreds of people have been injured, according to Palestinian officials On Monday, the Israeli military said 40,000 Palestinians had taken part in ""violent riots"" at 13 locations along the Gaza Strip security fence. Palestinians hurled stones and incendiary devices while the Israeli military used snipers, as black smoke poured from burning tyres. The health ministry, run by Hamas, said children were among those killed. The Israeli military said it had killed three people trying to plant explosives near the security fence in Rafah. Aircraft and tanks had also targeted military positions belonging to Hamas in the northern Gaza Strip, it said. Israel says the protests are aimed at breaching the border and attacking Israeli communities nearby. There were also violent clashes between Israeli police and protesters who raised Palestinian flags outside the new embassy. Several protesters were detained. Feras Kilani, BBC Arabic, at the protests in Gaza Tuesday is expected to be a very big demonstration because it is a day known by the Palestinians as the ""Catastrophe"" that followed the creation of the state of Israel. Palestinians will go to bury the dozens of people killed on Monday and then they will come again to demonstrate. You can imagine the situation with all this anger, thousands of Palestinians will come here and will try to cross the fence to return to what they see as their land - what they do not see as Israel but as Palestine. It is expected to be bigger than Monday and more bloody. Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas condemned what he called Israeli ""massacres against our people"", and declared three days of mourning. Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu said: ""Every nation has the right to defend its borders.

A small interim embassy will start operating from Monday inside the existing US consulate building in Jerusalem. A larger site will be found later when the rest of the embassy moves from Tel Aviv. This video can not be played Donald Trump addresses the ceremony via videolink The opening ceremony was brought forward to coincide with the state of Israel's 70th anniversary. Mr Trump's daughter, Ivanka, and her husband Jared Kushner, who are both senior White House advisers, joined US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan for the ceremony. How did the world react to embassy move? Five key takeaways from Jerusalem decision After Ivanka Trump had unveiled the seal of the embassy, Mr Kushner said in his address: ""When President Trump makes a promise he keeps it... We have shown the world that the US can be trusted. We stand with our friends and allies."" Mr Kushner also referred to Mr Trump's withdrawal from the ""dangerous, flawed and one-sided Iran deal"", drawing applause from the guests. Mr Netanyahu said: ""What a glorious day. Remember this moment. This is history. President Trump, by recognising history, you have made history. All of us are deeply grateful."" Mahmoud Abbas condemned the embassy as a ""settlement in East Jerusalem"", saying that the US was ""no longer a mediator in the Middle East"". Arab League chief Ahmed Abul Gheit said it was ""shameful to see countries participating with the US and Israel in celebrating the former's embassy move to occupied Jerusalem in a clear and grave violation of international law"". The status of Jerusalem goes to the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Can the settlement issue be solved? The alternatives to a two-state solution Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem is not recognised internationally and, according to the 1993 Israel-Palestinian peace accords, the final status of Jerusalem is meant to be discussed in the latter stages of peace talks. Israel has occupied East Jerusalem since the 1967 Middle East war. It effectively annexed the sector, though this was not recognised by any countries until Mr Trump's declaration in December 2017. This video can not be played Why the ancient city of Jerusalem is so important Since 1967, Israel has built a dozen settlements, home to about 200,000 Jews, in East Jerusalem. These are considered illegal under international law, although Israel disputes this. Why do evangelicals support Trump on Jerusalem?

Lady Jowell once said she'd ""jump under a bus"" for Tony Blair. She was probably only half-joking. However, her loyalty to New Labour was more than simply tactical or careerist. She was pro-European and in favour of a mixed-economy when both were deeply unfashionable on the left. Her belief that Labour should ""modernise"" was passionately held - forged at the coal face of a decade of Labour local activism. Lady Jowell will be remembered at Westminster as someone who managed to be ideologically committed to her cause without overt sectarian bitterness. Obituary: Dame Tessa Jowell Lady Jowell, a former social worker, first stood for Parliament in a 1978 by-election in Ilford North on the Essex-London border. She lost to her Conservative rival and was defeated again the following year. She made it to Westminster in 1992, as MP for Dulwich and West Norwood. In 1997, she was one of the 101 female Labour MPs on the benches following the party's landslide victory. Lady Jowell was employment minister and minister for women, before joining the cabinet as culture secretary in 2001, during which she helped bring the Olympic Games to London. In 2012 she was made Dame Tessa Jowell in the Birthday Honours for political and charitable services. After stepping down from the Commons at the 2015 general election, she was made Baroness Jowell of Brixton.

"The teenager called her win 'astonishing' Teenage pianist Lauren Zhang has won the BBC's prestigious Young Musician competition, just days before she starts her GCSEs. The 16-year-old took the title after playing Prokofiev's challenging Piano Concerto No 2, accompanied the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra. Kerry Andrew, chair of the judging panel, said the performance ""left us all breathless"". Lauren beat cellist Maxim Calver and sax player Rob Burton to win the title. ""I'm astonished!"" she said after receiving the prize. ""I'm pleasantly surprised and I can't believe it. ""The journey, right from the start of the competition, has been incredible."" Lauren said she 'really enjoyed' her performance in Birmingham's Symphony Hall Born in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Lauren started learning piano at the age of four, and is also an accomplished violinist. The musician moved to the UK in 2010, bringing her family with her, after winning a place at the Royal Birmingham Conservatoire. She won the BBC's competition on home turf - having previously played in Birmingham's Symphony Hall at school concerts. BBC Young Musician - official site Although this was her first time playing with a professional orchestra, conductor Mark Wigglesworth had nothing but praise for the youngster. ""When you meet Lauren she seems... I wouldn't say 'shy', but controlled within herself and very confident about her own personality,"" he said. ""Then you hear her play and you discover this incredible depth and range of thought and imagination. That's an extraordinary combination."" This video can not be played Get to know Young Musician finalists Max, Rob and Lauren Lauren said she chose Prokofiev's second piano concerto because it balanced ""lyrical, elegant"" melodies with moments that are more ""grotesque or bizarre"". In addition, she confessed, it neatly fitted into the final's the 30-minute time limit. Not that it was an easy piece to learn: ""I really had to practise it quite a few times before I could play without stopping in the middle because it was just so difficult,"" she said. Son of a joiner becomes UK's richest man British Gas owner loses 110,000 accounts Should we all become early risers? But speaking on BBC Four after the performance, Lauren said she ""really enjoyed playing"" the piece. The BBC Young Musician competition began in 1978, and previous winners  - including Nicola Benedetti, Freddy Kempf and Sheku Kanneh-Mason - have gone on to achieve worldwide success. Having taken the 2018 title, Lauren will now perform at BBC Music'sBiggest Weekend in Coventryon 28 May, and also at a specialBBC Young Musician 40th anniversaryconcert at the BBC Proms on 15 July at the Royal Albert Hall in London. She'll have to juggle these commitments with her exams, which start on Tuesday with a French paper. ""I think it's quite stressful juggling GCSEs with this competition,"" she said.

"This video can not be played Gove expresses doubts about Brexit customs plan Michael Gove has cast doubt on the viability of Theresa May's proposed customs partnership with the EU after Brexit, telling the BBC it has ""flaws"". The environment secretary said there were ""significant question marks"" about whether the model, described as crazy by Boris Johnson, was deliverable. The PM, whose ministers are considering two customs options, says ""compromises"" will be needed but she will ""deliver"". But Labour said the lack of a decision on the critical issue was ""farcical"". The UK is committed to leaving the current customs union when it exits the EU on 29 March 2019 and ministers are under pressure to agree soon on a successor arrangement amid divisions in cabinet. The customs partnership thought to be preferred by Mrs May would see Britain continue to collect tariffs on behalf of the EU, as well as refunding UK firms if they were only liable for lower rates. Writing in the Sunday Times,external, Mrs May promised a solution which ensured frictionless trade, enabled the UK to strike trade deals around the world and which did not result in a hard border on the island of Ireland. Johnson: No 10's customs plans 'crazy' DUP MP hits out at Irish foreign minister Leonard calls for cross-party Brexit talks ""You can trust me to deliver,"" she wrote. ""I will not let you down"". On the customs issues, she said she had ""proposed different options for a new customs arrangement with the EU and the government will continue to develop them during the negotiations"". A 'highly streamlined' customs arrangement - This would minimise customs checks rather than getting rid of them altogether, using new technologies and things like trusted trader schemes, which could allow companies to pay duties in bulk every few months rather than every time their goods crossed a border A customs partnership - This would remove the need for new customs checks at the border. The UK would collect tariffs set by the EU customs union on goods coming into the UK. If those goods didn't leave the UK and UK tariffs on them were lower, companies could then claim back the difference. Mr Gove, one of the leading Brexiteers in the cabinet, told the Andrew Marr show that he trusted the PM to reach an agreement but he expressed doubts about what is believed to be her preferred option. The leading Leave campaigner is one of a group of cabinet ministers asked by the PM to stress-test the partnership model - which would see the UK collect tariffs set by the EU on goods coming into the UK. ""Because it is novel, because no model like this exists, there have to be significant question marks over the deliverability of it on time,"" he said. ""More than that, what it requires the British government to do is, in effect, act as the tax collector... for the European Union... It is my view that the new customs partnership has flaws and that they need to be tested."" The Irish foreign minister said he ""did not take his lead"" from Boris Johnson Neither this option nor the alternative - a ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement using technology to ensure the seamless movement of goods - was ""absolutely perfect"", he acknowledged. But Labour's Sir Keir Starmer said neither of the options were ""workable nor acceptable to the EU"" and, with time running out, Parliament must force the government's hand by backing a ""comprehensive"" customs union. ""We are in a farcical situation,"" he told the Andrew Marr show. ""We want a vote on a customs union with the EU. That is the only way to resolve this impasse."" Mrs May has insisted the final Brexit deal must honour the agreements in the Northern Ireland peace process - and that there can be no hard border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. But Simon Coveney, the Irish foreign minister, dismissed the idea of using any form of infrastructure or technology to maintain separate customs regimes between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. He told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show: ""We just simply think it won't work. If you don't believe me on it, listen to people who are living locally. Have voters changed their minds about Brexit? May splits cabinet to seek Brexit solution ""Listen to the chief constable of the PSNI. He is saying any infrastructure on the border, any physical infrastructure on the border, is going to represent a risk to his officers."" Suggesting the Irish government ""did not take its lead"" from Boris Johnson and warning of a ""difficult summer"", he said the two governments could agree a ""shared customs space or shared customs territory"". In other Brexit developments, a cross-party group of former cabinet ministers - including former Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg and former Labour foreign secretary David Miliband - has urged Parliament to vote to remain in both the customs union and the single market, arguing it is vital for the economy. And student organisations representing almost a million young people have also written to MPs demanding a referendum on any final Brexit deal. Organised by the campaign group For our Future's Sake, the letter from 60 student unions says promises made by pro-Brexit groups have not been kept and that an estimated 1.4 million people were too young to vote in June 2016 but now deserve a say.

Lady Jowell once said she'd ""jump under a bus"" for Tony Blair. She was probably only half-joking. However, her loyalty to New Labour was more than simply tactical or careerist. She was pro-European and in favour of a mixed-economy when both were deeply unfashionable on the left. Her belief that Labour should ""modernise"" was passionately held - forged at the coal face of a decade of Labour local activism. Lady Jowell will be remembered at Westminster as someone who managed to be ideologically committed to her cause without overt sectarian bitterness. Obituary: Dame Tessa Jowell Lady Jowell, a former social worker, first stood for Parliament in a 1978 by-election in Ilford North on the Essex-London border. She lost to her Conservative rival and was defeated again the following year. She made it to Westminster in 1992, as MP for Dulwich and West Norwood. In 1997, she was one of the 101 female Labour MPs on the benches following the party's landslide victory. Lady Jowell was employment minister and minister for women, before joining the cabinet as culture secretary in 2001, during which she helped bring the Olympic Games to London. In 2012 she was made Dame Tessa Jowell in the Birthday Honours for political and charitable services. After stepping down from the Commons at the 2015 general election, she was made Baroness Jowell of Brixton.

" I am quite a bright, colourful person. I try to be enthusiastic and funny. I don’t know if I am actually funny, but I do try. I’m quite an  expressive person, not very neat, not much of a perfectionist. My image shows this - it's quite messy. But I know that in the privacy of my own brain there is a lot more going on. I am quite private with my emotions, that’s why there is a big, ugly circle in the middle of my brain. There is a lot of stuff going on in there that people don’t know about, which I wanted to represent. It’s my own struggle and something I have always dealt with, but it also forms a lot of my outward personality. So there is a darkness, but it helps me to be more colourful and cheerful. I’ve always pulled through on my own, or other people have helped me without knowing that they did. I don’t see the need to burden others with it if I don’t have to. I have suffered from depression in the past. It’s not something I expected to happen - it just suddenly hit me. One day I started to feel very tired and wanted to stay in bed for the whole day. And then it lasted for about two years. Most people take mental health for granted. It's only when you get sick or some life event hits you that you really understand what it means. When I was depressed, I lost all interest in doing things. It took me about five years to come out of it. In the picture I have tried to put a mask in front of my face. I'm a receptionist and I tend to get a lot of sales calls. Even though I get annoyed, I need to pretend to be nice - like wearing a mask. I stayed in the dark for so long. Now that I am out of it, I try to be colourful. I never know when the depression will come back to hit me. I’ve realised I am quite a conflicted person, which I tried to reflect with the black and white in my image. It’s like there are two very different people within me - but I'm as much one as I am the other. One part of me wants to be free and detached and to not exist really - to be invisible in the world and free from responsibility, to travel and disappear. The other half wants stability with relationships and future. I think I put too much pressure on myself [to resolve this conflict]. There is blue in the image because I think it's the most beautiful colour. It's quite a sad colour, but it’s a beautiful sadness. It's like the sea and the sky, the two things that you can’t see the end of - they are so vast. I've been thinking about my mental health recently, as I'm getting a new therapist. It's a big part of my life. I have psychosis and suffer from delusions, and that kind of thing. But it’s not something that generally I'm really bothered about. I also have OCD - I have to do things a number of times because I feel something bad will happen if I don't. If I walk down steps and find I have to miss every even-numbered step, I know it's going to be a bad day. The OCD has changed my life a lot, but I've learnt to ignore other things, such as the hallucinations. Some days are worse than others. I have social anxiety, so sometimes I will avoid social situations where I know there will be a lot of people. I was assigned female at birth, but I identify as a man. I knew when I was 11 but I didn't come out until I was about 15. If you come out in your teens, people say, “You should have known sooner”. But if you come out as a child they claim that you can't know already. My mum says she is still grieving because her daughter died. I still like to do feminine things, like put on make up. My parents find this very confusing, though. When I came out, they didn't believe me, so I had to dress more manly and do typically manly things so they would accept it. My mental health has caused a huge disaster, and now I am trying to build myself back up. The pictures on my image are basically little references to my life. Most of the drawing is about my daughters. I drew a dice because everything seems like a bit of a gamble I’ve got bipolar disorder. The way it works is that things start whizzing around your head very fast and you start getting lots of ideas and making connections. It’s great when there is a peak to it, but not if it goes further and you make a connection when there isn't one. It can send you a bit crazy. When I didn’t know that I had it, I was going up the wall. Being a bit up and down mood-wise means I don’t really suit a nine-to-five job. Art and music suit my personality. Bipolar is one of those things you have to come to terms with. I found out as much as I could about it, which meant I could control it better. I was on lithium, but you can only be on it for so long. I could feel some differences in my body, and what it was doing to me, so I worked out different strategies to cope with the bipolar. Nowadays I am very good at coping with it. I run all the time which gets rid of all excess energy, as well as keeping me fit. You have to look out for signs of the bipolar. For example, once I start being entertaining, like making people laugh at the pub, it feels great. But that can be the start of the high. It can feel fantastic - except it just all starts getting out of hand. That’s when it can start getting irritating for people. My image shows a car. I worked in the taxi trade for about 30 years - it was what I lived for. I liked it because I would chat to people - hear their stories. Then I became ill, with depression mainly. It was kind of downhill from there. Then my wife died. The last two years, I did everything for her. In the past four months, I haven't wanted to see anybody. I don't want to go out. I'm  just looking at four walls - within those walls are  memories. What do you do? Pack them in a suitcase and forget about them? You can't, you just have to carry on. People say I am strong, but I'm not. I've had counselling but it hasn't made a difference. With time it gets easier, but you don't forget. They are still there and always will be. Today I had to go to the opticians around the corner to ask if they could stop sending letters to my wife. Every time I get mail for her, it brings it back. Even on the good days, I feel as though I'm not getting anywhere. But a good day is better than the bad day you had the day before. It's not a quick fix. But only I can make the changes I drew a rose, because it got complexity and it's quite beautiful. The red rose speaks a lot about love if you give it to somebody. I think it says I am a very loving person. I am a community mental health worker. It is a very rewarding job for me and I feel privileged to help people with complex lives. It can take more than eight months now to get a medical assessment and to see a psychiatric doctor. It’s really cruel, these people are really unwell and they need immediate help. And it’s just waiting and waiting, and they become so anxious. They even go in and out of A&E because they have a panic attack and things like that, but there is no quick way to see a psychiatric doctor. GPs refer people to CBT therapy and self-help groups, but there is a 12-week wait for that. When someone's first language isn't English, it's even more difficult for them. In our South Asian, Bangladeshi cultures, it's thought women should be multi-functional and not get ill. They should just get on with life. Mental health isn't really recognised. Women have control in their house - financial control for example. But often don't have the education or the freedom to earn that money for themselves. Freedom is a very big thing that plays on their minds. I am not embarrassed like I used to be [about showing my emotions]. If you cry, just let it come out. When I lost my dad, I used to suddenly burst into tears when I saw someone who looked like him on the street. My dad was always a big part of my life. He always wanted to help vulnerable people - whether in Manchester or Bangladesh. That’s what I am doing. I am not one for labels when talking about mental health issues, they are so unique to an individual it's difficult to have a specific name for a thing. Depression to one person means something else to another.But I’ve had issues with that kind of stuff, with anger stuff. I'm a bottler - I bottle things up. My image has four main elements. With the waves, I’ve spent a lot of time sailing, and when you're out on the water you realise how small and insignificant you are in the world. It's nice to think how little you matter, so you can just enjoy what you are doing. The scales are the biggest representative symbol. It’s weighing up how much pain I would get from doing one thing versus how much I would gain in the long run. It’s an uncomfortable set of scales to be holding - and if I could drop them, I would. The dragon represents my escapism. I am one of those people who plays Dungeons and Dragons and fantasy stuff. Rather than having to think about important things in reality, it creates a different world where you can do whatever you want. I would be lying if I said I am a fundamentally happy person. I am a pessimist and I don’t like it. I've got Parkinson’s disease. It was a relief to be told, because when you put a name to it, it makes sense. I am scared about the future. There is not much of it. At 82 - I didn’t think I’d live this long. There are more memories behind which are excellent. When I go to bed at night, I sleep solid for hours and I sometimes have some lovely dreams despite the drugs I am on. I’d like to just go and sit on a mountain in Tibet. Just watching the sunset and the sunrise. The people in Tibet usually look after the elderly. After my husband died I had a mental breakdown. I had no children or family here. Social services were involved and they told me they would not be able to help me. I felt very angry with them. I got all my stuff into my living room and wanted to set the house on fire. One of my neighbours then knocked on my door and asked me what I was doing. I live alone and I do get scared, but I feel a lot better than I did before. I want to go to visit Bangladesh, but I don’t know what I would do if I went back there permanently. When I see ladies that are really stressed out, I tell them to pray to Allah. If you are stressed inside your house, get out and talk to somebody. I'm an aspiring broadcaster and musician. For the past six years, I’ve been involved in a project on the weather and tracking storms. Since the new year, I have been quite depressed. I guess I don’t feel as though I'm performing as well as I should in what I am doing I had a difficult time at school. I left at 14 and was home-schooled until college. I struggled because of various mental health issues that I had at the time - mainly depression and anxiety. When I was younger, it was social and communication issues. But I guess I’ve got over that - mainly through broadcasting. I feel quite isolated and lonely, because I just don’t really identify with many people within my age group. Sometimes I might go for a night out, but I don’t do it religiously like people my age do. I guess I am just a lonely soul, but there we go. In my image, there is a tiny umbrella above my head and a big rainstorm that completely dwarfs the umbrella - which I think is very apt for my situation in general. I am quite a rational thinker - but thought it was quite ironic to spell “rationale” wrong intentionally. The white stuff around the musical note is white noise. In my line of work, I have to deal with a lot of white noise. White noise to me is also the conflict that can be created within a group of people. The brown stuff above my shoulder is where my worst thoughts usually are. At two points in the past three years, I have had an existential crisis where I was just worried about the whole big picture of the world and the universe. There is also a representation of my mismanaged and hopeless romanticism - which is going on at the moment. The yellow wall is my defence area. If people are rude about me, I am usually mentally strong enough to block it off. But sometimes the wall can drop away a little bit, and I can get triggered into depression. The blocks at the bottom resemble the workload I have at the moment - brick by brick. It’s completely disorganised to the point where a task on my to-do list is to write a to-do list. The number one represents the position I'd like to be in my field, and the number 10 is how I usually feel. Built with Shorthand",Positive,1.0
"This video can not be played Eyewitness Jonathan says the attacker's hands were covered in blood The suspect in a deadly knife attack in central Paris on Saturday evening is a French citizen born in 1997 in Russia's republic of Chechnya, sources say. Named by media as Khamzat Asimov, he was on a French watch list of people who could pose a threat to national security, the sources said. Police shot dead the attacker in the busy OpÃ©ra district after he killed a man and injured four other people. The Islamic State (IS) group said it was behind the attack. French President Emmanuel Macron tweeted (in French): ""France has once again paid in blood,external, but will not give an inch to the enemies of freedom."" Later on Sunday, a judicial source said that a friend of the suspect had been detained for questioning in the eastern city of Strasbourg. France has been on high alert following a series of attacks. More than 230 people have been killed by IS-inspired jihadists in the past three years. The suspect was not carrying any identification papers and has not yet been officially named. Sources told French media the man had no criminal record and his parents had been held for questioning. He is believed to be a French citizen who was naturalised in 2010. This video can not be played French police at the scene of the attack in Paris The man had been categorised as ""fiche S"", the sources said. This flags people considered to be a possible threat to national security and allows for surveillance without being a cause for arrest. It includes those suspected of Islamist radicalisation but is wide-ranging and covers such groups as political extremists, gangsters and even football hooligans. In 2015, then Prime Minister Manuel Valls said there were 20,000 names on the list, about half related to Islamist radicalisation. This would be the first time an assailant of Chechen origin has carried out a terrorist attack in France. France is home to some 30,000 people of Chechen origin. Interior Minister GÃ©rard Collomb said the man who died was a 29-year-old passer-by but gave no further details. The four who were injured have also not yet been named. AFP news agency, citing sources, said a 34-year-old man and a 54-year-old woman were seriously hurt, while a 26-year-old woman and a 31-year-old man were slightly wounded. One of the injured was a Chinese citizen, Chinese media have reported. Mr Collomb said none had life-threatening injuries. The attacker began stabbing passers-by at about 21:00 local time (19:00 GMT). Eyewitnesses described him as a young man with brown hair and a beard, dressed in black tracksuit trousers. He shouted ""Allahu Akbar"" (God is greatest) during the attack, witnesses said. The man tried to enter several bars and restaurants but was blocked by people inside. Police first tried to stop the assailant with a Taser before shooting him dead, nine minutes after he began the attack. Jonathan, a waiter at a local restaurant, told AFP: ""I saw him with a knife in his hand. He looked crazy."" AFP news agency released an undated photo of Khamzat Asimov He said a woman, stabbed by the attacker, had run into into the restaurant bleeding. The assailant tried to follow her inside but was fended off and finally fled. Two of the wounded in the attack are in a serious condition but do not have life-threatening injuries. IS said it was behind the attack in a brief statement posted on its news outlet. Chechnya is a republic in the North Caucasus region of southern Russia. The republic declared independence in 1991 but three years later Russian troops were sent in to quash the movement, sparking a decade-long conflict. Chechnya - boiling point for conflict Jihadist groups, including those aligned with IS, have long operated in the region. The brothers behind the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013, Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, had Chechen links and Turkish authorities said a Chechen jihadist was the suspected organiser of an attack on Istanbul airport in 2016 that killed 45 people. The jihadist, Akhmed Chatayev, a member of IS,was killed in a clash with special forces in the Georgian capital Tbilisi in 2017. IS has actively recruited fighters in Chechnya, sending hundreds to conflicts in Syria and elsewhere. A report from the BBC's Sarah Rainsford in 2016 spoke of the fear that the fighters would return to carry out terrorist attacks at home. This video can not be played Officials at Grozny's central mosque are looking carefully for hints of radicalisation Strongman Ramzan Kadyrov, who was nominated for the Chechen presidency by Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2007 and is now firmly in control, has tried to halt IS recruitment but human rights activists say his measures have been brutal and have often helped radicalisation.

"Deadpool has apologised to David Beckham after making a joke about him in his first film. In the 2016 movie Deadpool, the superhero said the former England captain sounds like he's been sucking helium. Ryan Reynolds turned up at Becks' house to make a very over the top apology in a clip promoting the sequel. Becks did get his own back though, reeling off some films he thinks Ryan should apologise for instead. The latest Deadpool is out later this month Unlike the other Marvel superheroes, Deadpool is all about breaking the rules. He's x-rated, he looks directly into the camera to speak to the audience, and he loves to have a laugh. Beckham is just one of many to have been mocked by the character, but in the clips it appears to have got to the former footballer. The video sees Becks watching the scene that mentions him in the first Deadpool film - and rewinding it to watch it again with an unimpressed look on his face. It goes without saying that there will be some graphic language in the clip. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Deadpool clearly feels bad that David's feelings have been hurt and sends him a text message asking for forgiveness. Then Deadpool turns up at Becks' door after the text is ignored - but milk and cookies, helium balloons and a mariachi band aren't enough to earn Beckham's forgiveness. Tickets to a football match eventually do the job, with Beckham telling Deadpool: ""I can't stay mad at you"". But then Becks gets a few digs in too. Deadpool reminds him about the voice joke but David seemingly doesn't know what he's talking about. ""What did you think I was apologising for?"" Deadpool asks. ""Green Lantern, R.I.P.D, Self/less, Blade: Trinity,"" Becks replies. Ouch. Fans have been loving the promo from the two stars. Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played About 20 signs have appeared in Oxford and the council claims they make the city hard to navigate Fake signs like Facebook Row and Snapchat End are causing confusion around the streets of Oxford. The social media-inspired signage was installed by the same mysterious artist who put upMiddle Earth and Narnia signs in nearby Didcot. The new signs include Twitter Lane, Emoji Alley, Instagram Ave, Google Walk, Selfie Passage, and WTF Lane. Oxford City Council said the signs would be removed as they make the city hard to navigate. About 20 of them have appeared in the city so far. The artist said he wanted to highlight the public's obsession with social media The city council said the signs would make Oxford harder to navigate The man responsible, who spoke to BBC News on condition of anonymity, said he wanted to highlight the public's obsession with social media. ""There's a lot said about what is real and what's not on social media, and so these signs of mine kind of reflect that climate,"" he said. ""My signs are not real. However, if you take a picture of them and when you see them in 2D photographs, they appear real."" He denied the prank was disruptive.

Regarding the new signs, a council spokesman said they made the city ""harder to navigate, particularly for those who do not have a smartphone"". He added: ""We do encourage street art and have a number of graffiti-free walls across Oxford.

"Dr Dre (not to be confused with Dr Drai) Hip-hop star Dr Dre has lost a long-running trademark dispute against a gynaecologist with a similar name. The case was first lodged in 2015, when Pennsylvania-based gynaecologist Draion M Burch tried to trademark the name Dr Drai. Dr Dre objected, saying the similarity could cause ""confusion"", especially as his near-namesake wanted to sell audio books and seminars under the moniker. But the US trademark office has disagreed and dismissed Dr Dre's case. In a ruling made last week, it said that, while the two names were similar, Dr Dre had failed to show that people would be misled into buying by Dr Drai's products. Given that the doctor's typical fee for a speaking engagement is $5,000 (Â£3,700), the consumer would be likely to exercise a ""higher degree of care"" than someone making a casual purchase, it said. Mr Burch had also argued that consumers would be unlikely to confuse the two names ""because Dr Dre is not a medical doctor nor is he qualified to provide any type of medical services or sell products specifically in the medical or healthcare industry"". He further testified that he did not seek to trade on Dr Dre's reputation because the association would be ""a bad reflection on me as a doctor"" - citing lyrics he characterised as misogynistic and homophobic. The gynaecologist is the author of books such as 20 Things You May Not Know About A Vagina and describes himself as one of America's top health experts. Dr Dre can currently be seen in the Netflix documentary The Defiant Ones, which charts his rise from the streets of Compton to the multi-millionaire executive in charge of Beats 1.

"The prime minister has raised the cases of the dual nationals being held in Iran with the country's president. In a telephone call, Theresa May urged Hassan Rouhani to make further progress over the release of British-Iranians ""on humanitarian grounds"". Mrs May also reiterated the UK's commitment to the Iran nuclear deal, which the US pulled out of last week. Downing Street said both leaders agreed to keep in contact about both topics ahead of a Brussels meeting on Tuesday. There are nearly 30 dual nationals being held by the Iranian authorities - many of whom are accused of security offences. Iran envoy seeks nuclear deal pledges Uncertain fate of Iran's jailed dual nationals Last month,London's Imperial College professor Abbas Edalat was detainedwhile reportedly attending an academic workshop in Tehran. Another case is that ofNazanin Zaghari Ratcliffe, who is currently serving a five-year prison sentence,after being convicted of spying charges. She has always denied the claims. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was arrested in 2016 during a holiday to introduce her baby daughter Gabriella to her parents. Meanwhile, Mrs May also used the phone callto bolster the European support for the Iran nuclear deal- designed to prevent the country developing atomic weapons. US President Donald Trump withdrew from the deal, which was one of his election pledges, but the UK, Germany and France remain ""firmly committed"" to upholding it. A Downing Street spokesman said: ""[Mrs May said] it is in both the UK and Iran's national security interests to maintain the deal and welcomed president Rouhani's public commitment to abide by its terms, adding that it is essential that Iran continues to meet its obligations. ""The prime minister made clear that the UK condemns the Iranian missile attacks against Israeli forces and called on Iran to refrain from any further attacks. ""She said it was important to avoid provocative actions to ensure peace and security in the region."" Who are the dual nationals jailed in Iran?
