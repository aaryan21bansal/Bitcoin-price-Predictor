"Stan Lee is the co-creator of Spiderman and numerous other Marvel characters Stan Lee is suing the entertainment company he co-founded for $1bn (Â£742m), according tolegal documents,external. The comic book legend alleges he was coerced into a fraudulent sales agreement when he was in an emotionally and physically fragile state. The complaint, filed in LA on Tuesday, claims Pow! Entertainment made Lee, 95, sign over his name and image rights. Pow! later issued a statement insisting that Lee had ""clearly understood"" the terms of the agreement. ""The allegations are completely without merit,""a company representative told the Hollywood Reporter,external. ""In particular, the notion that Mr Lee did not knowingly grant Pow! exclusive rights to his creative works or his identity is so preposterous that we have to wonder whether Mr Lee is personally behind this lawsuit."" It added: ""The evidence, which includes Mr Lee's subsequent statements and conduct, is overwhelming and we look forward to presenting it in court."" Stan Lee on how to create a super-hero Pow!'s parent company, Hong Kong-based Camsing International Holding, said it was seeking legal advice. Pow! Entertainment has previously expressed ""concern"" over Lee's wellbeing. Lee is the co-creative force behind many superhero characters, including Black Panther and Spider-Man. The lawsuit alleges Pow! chief executive Shane Duffy and co-founder Gill Champion ""conspired and agreed to broker a sham deal to sell Pow! to a company in China and fraudulently steal Stan Lee's identity, name, image, and likeness as part of a nefarious scheme to benefit financially at Lee's expense"". The complaint, lodged at Los Angeles County Superior Court, states Lee does not recall signing sale documents, nor having them read to him. Joan Lee, Stan's wife of almost 70 years, died last July aged 95 The suit draws attention to thedeath of Lee's wife last July, and his degenerative eye condition which has caused his poor eyesight, suggesting he could not have read the documents. The legal papers also say Pow! took control of Lee's personal social media accounts. He appeared to regain control of his Twitter account on Tuesday and used the platform to tell fans his social media channels had been ""hijacked"". Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played Are tumble dryers still a fire risk? New fears have been raised about tumble dryers catching fire, despite efforts to modify the machines. The BBC's Watchdog Live consumer programme has uncovered cases in which the machines have caught fire after being fixed. Some 5.3 million tumble dryers under the Hotpoint, Creda and Indesit brands required modification. Whirlpool, which owns the three brands, said it had total confidence in the fix for the machines. The original defect was discovered in 2015 and has reportedly led to scores of fires since 2004. The company began a huge operation to modify or replace dryers to ensure they are safe. Government introduces new product safety office Truth, fires and tumble dryers: Are our home appliances safe? However, Watchdog spoke to Vicki Mudge and her sister-in-law Jemma Greenslade who said they had to drag Vicki's burning tumble dryer out of their flat. It had earlier been modified. Jemma (left) and Vicki had to drag a burning tumble dryer out of their flat. ""You do trust them to think they are fixing something so it is going to be ok. It is disgusting really,"" Jemma said. They said that, as they lived in a block of flats, the fire could have been a risk to their neighbours. Domestic service engineer Graham Watkinson - who has worked with electrical appliances for over 40 years - believes the modification does not totally remove the risk. Charlie Pugsley, deputy assistant commissioner at the London Fire Brigade, said he was seriously concerned about the reports of modified dryers catching fire. ""There is going to be a time delay between the modification and the fires occurring so if we are starting to see one or two, I would imagine it is only going to get worse,"" he said. ""Each fire has got the potential to do huge damage to someone's home and risk lives."" The damage caused to a seventh floor flat in Shepherd's Bush, London In August 2016, a dryer - awaiting modification - was blamed for a huge fire in a West London tower block, with more than 50 people forced to flee their homes. Despite that incident the company continued to state the machines were safe to use as long as someone was in the property. Which? threatened to bring judicial review proceedings against Trading Standards over the advice being given. Trading Standards instructed Whirlpool to issue new guidance earlier last year that the dryers should be unplugged and not be used until they had been repaired. Andy Slaughter, the MP in the area of the tower block fire, said: ""I am really worried that people now think that the problem is solved - that they can go out, go to sleep and leave machines on - because they have been modified or replaced, but actually there is still a real danger that they could catch fire."" In a statement Whirlpool said: ""We have total confidence in the modification. Extensive testing and analysis of the modification both before and since its implementation has shown it provides an effective solution for the issue. ""An external review with the input from three independent experts in fire safety, product safety, and engineering, concluded that the modification remains the most effective way of rectifying this issue for consumers. ""There have been no reported incidents where the modification has shown to be ineffective. Recent criticisms of the effectiveness of the modification are based on fundamental technical misunderstandings of what it addresses. We are concerned that such misinformed criticism risks discouraging consumers from registering for this important safety modification. ""We continue to urge consumers to contact us immediately if they believe they still own an affected appliance. We can assure consumers that if they contact us now, they can receive a resolution within one week.""

"A member of the Windrush generation says he was left ""broken"" after being wrongly detained in an immigration centre because he was unable to prove he had a right to live in the UK. Anthony Bryan, 60, came from Jamaica in 1965 but last year was threatened with deportation by the Home Office. He spoke to MPs and peers with Paulette Wilson, who had a similar experience. Mr Bryan agreed with a suggestion that a factor in the way he was treated was because he was black. He was asked by Labour peer Baroness Lawrence if he thought things would have been different if he had been from Canada, New Zealand or Australia, to which he replied: ""I hate to say it, but I don't think I would have this problem"". Sixty-three Windrush migrants 'removed' New home secretary in Windrush vow Who are the Windrush generation? When she asked him if he saw ""race as being a big part"" in what happened, he said: ""In the Home Office? Yes."" The murder of Mrs Lawrence's son Stephen in 1993 led to an inquiry which found there had been institutional racism in the Metropolitan Police. Mr Bryan, a grandfather from north London, was held in a detention centre twice, for almost three weeks, last year. His difficulties began when he lost his job after receiving a letter informing him he had no right to remain, despite having lived in the UK since he was eight. This video can not be played Windrush migrants: We weren't believed Mr Bryan told a parliamentary committee how he had phoned his family from the detention centre to tell them: ""It looks like you're going to see me in Jamaica."" He continued: ""They had tickets for me - I thought I was going, to be honest."" ""I was resigned because I couldn't fight any more. I just gave up,"" he told the Joint Committee on Human Rights. He said he explained to the officials who came to detain him at his home that he had lived in the UK for most of his life, adding: ""But to them I was lying... everything I was telling them, I had to prove that"". Mr Bryan, who was accompanied at the hearing by his partner Janet McKay-Williams, was released from the immigration centre in November after a last-minute intervention from a lawyer. Stories of Commonwealth migrants who arrived in the UK legally as children between the late 1940s and 1973, but have no formal documentation to prove they have the right to remain in the country, have emerged in recent weeks. The Windrush generation is named after the ship that brought the first arrivals to Britain from the Caribbean in 1948. This video can not be played A look back at life when the Windrush generation arrived in the UK Grandmother Ms Wilson, 61, from Wolverhampton, gave evidence to the MPs and peers on the committee alongside her daughter, Natalie Barnes. She said that without the efforts of her daughter ""I would be in Jamaica, all alone"". Ms Wilson had been looked after by her grandparents in Wellington, Telford, when she first arrived in Britain from Jamaica in 1968 at the age of 10. She received a letter from the Home Office in 2015 and was told to report each month to immigration officials.  In October last year she was detained and taken to the Yarl's Wood immigration removal centre, where she spent a week before being released. Ms Wilson said: ""The first thing I got was a letter saying I was an illegal immigrant. At the time I didn't understand it but it took me about a week before I could show my daughter I had got this letter. ""They were saying I don't belong here - I've got six months to get out."" Referring to the decision to detain her, Ms Wilson told the committee: ""Where could I have run to? My family is here in England. I wouldn't have run away."" ""I was thinking they were going to pick me up here and put me on the plane and probably when I get there people's going to kill me.  I was thinking all sorts of things in my head."" Ms Barnes said ""documents were very hard to come by, They kept telling us to go here, there and everywhere... it was just very hard to get that evidence"". Woman resident in UK since 1968 freed Committee chairwoman Harriet Harman said she would write to Home Secretary Sajid Javid to get the Home Office to give Mr Bryan and Ms Wilson their files so they could see the information that officials had about them. The home secretary said this week that63 members of the Windrush generation could have been wrongfully removedor deported from the UK since 2002. But Mr Javid, who took over the post last month afterAmber Rudd resigned, told MPs he did not have information on how many Windrush immigrants had been detained. What is Windrush Day?

"Every Govia Thameslink train time is being changed The time of every train on Britain's largest rail franchise, Govia Thameslink (GTR), will change as part of a major shake-up. Arrival and departure times are being re-set from Sunday and some services will call at different stations. Some signal workers have claimed it is going to be ""a disaster"", the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union said. GTR said nearly 400 extra trains each day would bring ""a significant boost"". The company said it would be running about 3,600 trains across its network - which includes Southern rail, Gatwick Express, Thameslink and Great Northern. But an RMT member said thenew timetable,externalwould slow down services by allowing more catch-up time on routes and more turnaround time at stations. This video can not be played A BBC investigation discovered Govia Thameslink was the worst for 'station skipping' The union, which recently marked two years of its dispute with GTR over the role of guards, warned there was potential for massive disruption to the ""core"" area of London, from London Bridge to St Pancras. RMT general secretary Mick Cash said the new timetable would place massive strains on infrastructure and staffing levels already under pressure and accused GTR of ""winging it with potentially disastrous consequences"". Timetable 'earthquake' to hit in May Trains missed stops '160 times a day' Protest over two-year Southern rail row GTR has urged passengers to check their plans before they travel. Chief executive Charles Horton said: ""We don't want passengers to get caught out and so we strongly advise them to look up the times of their trains as they will find that from 20 May each and every one of them has changed. ""Due to the sheer scale of the changes, we will have to redeploy a large number of trains and crews and services may not run at normal times during the introductory phase, although the impact on peak-time services during the transition will be minimal."" The RMT union recently marked two years of its dispute with Govia Thameslink GTR has promised ""huge benefits"" with space for an extra 50,000 morning peak-time passengers travelling into London. It said 80 more stations would have direct services to central London stations by next year. Passengers have also been promised ""enhanced frequency, reliability and connectivity across the network"", particularly at Brighton, Bedford, Luton and East Croydon.

"The Pope has issued instructions telling nuns to use social media apps ""with sobriety and discretion"". The document, titled Cor Orans, clarifies rules governing monastic life that were issued in 2016. It says the guidance is intended to safeguard silence and recollection. The document mentions ""social communications"" rather than specific apps, butCatholic newspaper the Tablet said,externalthat this referred to Facebook and Twitter among other services. The document says that discretion should apply to ""the quantity of the information and the type of communication"",external, in addition to the actual content of the media. An order of nuns in northern Spain made headlines last month after taking to social media to comment ona controversial case in Pamplona that saw a group of men accused of gang rape given what many regarded to be unduly lenient sentences. On their Facebook page (in Spanish),external, the Carmelite Nuns of Hondarribia defended the victim by pointing out the free choice they had made to live in a convent, to not drink alcohol or go out at night. ""Because it is a FREE decision, we will defend with all means available to us (and this is one) the right of all women to FREELY do the opposite without being judged, raped, intimidated or humiliated for it,"" they added. The latest guidance is not thought to have come about as a result of that case; and this is not the first time the Catholic Church has issued guidelines on social media use for nuns. The original constitution on feminine monastic life, Sponsa Christi Ecclesia, was published in 1950 by Pope Pius XII, but Pope Francis expanded the document in 2016 to warn against digital culture's ""decisive influence"" on society. He urged nuns not to let digital media ""become occasions for wasting time"". The Vatican itself is a prolific tweeter. It has posted close to 15,000 messages on its news account and more than 1,500 times via thePope's English-language official page,external. It also runs Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and Google+ accounts. 'Only one in four' trust social media Is social media making your child sad?

"This video can not be played The Typhoon was drafted in to replace a Lancaster bomber in a memorial flight Crowds of people were left disappointed after a mix-up led to them missing a flypast by an RAF Typhoon over the Derwent Dam. Spectators were initially informed a Lancaster Bomber, marking the 75th anniversary of the Dambusters raid, would not fly due to bad weather. They were then told its replacement, a Typhoon, would also not fly, only for it to roar over minutes later. The RAF has apologised to those who attended the event for the confusion. Sqn Ldr Andy Millikin, the Officer Commanding the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight, tweeted that the Lancaster, and later the Typhoon, could not make it to the dams due to poor weather. However, not long after his post the Typhoon flew overhead as many people had already started leaving the Ladybower Reservoir area. Many people were leaving when the Typhoon thundered overhead Sharon Fitton, who was one of many people who were annoyed about the mix-up, tweeted: ""What a shame thousands of people waiting for hours to read flyby cancelled, yet Typhoon has just flown over all leaving spectators. Poor show RAF."" Stuart Needham added: ""I've got some footage of me and my missus in the pub listening to the sound of a jet flying overhead after reading and being told by a copper it had been cancelled.""

It is understood that the confusion arose when the pilot said he could not fly the proposed route due to low cloud. However, he overcame the problem by flying in a different direction but this message was not passed on. Many people turned up to watch the Typhoon fly over the dam The flypast was to mark the 100th anniversary of the Royal Air Force and 75th anniversary of the Dambusters raid by 617 Squadron.

"The government's flagship Brexit bill is to return to the House of Commons having suffered a total of 15 defeats in the Lords. Brexit Minister Lord Callanan said he had ""a tremendous sigh of relief"" as he wound up proceedings. Labour urged Theresa May to take a ""pragmatic view"" of all the changes proposed by peers. The 15th defeat came on the issue of environmental protection standards after Brexit. Peers voted by a majority of 50 to say the government should set up a body to maintain EU standards. Other defeats inflicted in the House of Lords - where the government does not have a majority - came on the customs union, the Irish border and removing the precise date of Brexit - 29 March 2019 - from the legislation. Government defeated on Brexit deal vote Fresh Lords defeat for Brexit bill MPs will now debate the amendments when the bill returns to the Commons, with no date officially set so far. ""No one can be in any doubt that we have listened,"" Lord Callanan told peers. ""The government has suffered defeats on 15 issues. ""Although I regret the number of defeats I am grateful to those many Lords who I think have worked constructively to improve the bill. ""This House has done its duty as a revising chamber. The bill has been scrutinised."" Labour's Lords Leader Baroness Smith said the bill was now ""in better shape"". ""I hope Mrs May will take a pragmatic view of how best to proceed rather than follow a purely ideological route that rejects sensible amendments,"" she added. The bill's 15 defeat came over environmental standards Earlier, peers backed a cross-party amendment designed to ensure EU environmental principles continue to have a basis in domestic law at the end of the post-Brexit transition period in December 2020. It requires the environment secretary to bring forward proposals for primary legislation to create a duty on public authorities to apply these principles, and to establish an independent public body to ensure compliance. Lord Krebs, who instigated the move, argued that while EU rules would be carried over into UK law, environmental principles underpinning them would not. Ministers had promised a consultation on the issue but lost by 294 to 244. Lord Krebs, the former chair of the Food Standards Agency, said he was ""not satisfied"" with the idea of a consultation and wanted guarantees that existing principles will continue to apply and be enforced. ""We have heard many times that the purpose of the Bill is to ensure that everything is the same the day after Brexit as it was the day before,"" he said. ""Yet for environmental protection things will not be the same. We're talking about the protection of our air quality, our water quality, rivers, oceans, habitats and biodiversity."" Lord Callanan argued the proposed change was ""premature"" in that it prejudged a period of consultation and would ""ultimately be detrimental to the future protection of environmental law"".

"So you weren't invited. Don't despair. Royal weddings are a global phenomenon. And hundreds of millions of people are expected to witness Prince Harry marry Meghan Markle in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle, whether on television or online, or by listening to proceedings on the radio. The streets of Windsor, Berkshire, will also be lined with thousands of well-wishers hoping to catch a glimpse of the happy couple in person. So whether you're watching from your sofa, a community street party or a far-flung location, here's how to ensure the perfect view. Royal wedding: All you need to know Remember the previous royal weddings Nice day for a royal white wedding? A non-Brits guide to the royal wedding All the main UK broadcasters are devoting much of Saturday to the occasion. While the ceremony doesn't begin until 12:00 BST, there will be several hours of commentary beforehand - and that's even before the guests start to arrive. Special programmes begin onBBC Oneand the BBC News Channel and onSky,external(on Sky News and Sky One), starting at 09:00 BST.  The full coverage onITV,externalkicks off at 09:25. The coverage will be streamed live on theBBC News websiteor onBBC iPlayer. It is worth noting that cameras inside the chapel will provide the same pictures to all the networks, so once the ceremony starts, the footage will be identical across the channels, although they will keep their separate commentaries. The BBC haswaived the TV licence fee, meaning street parties and other special eventscan screen the wedding livewithout buying a licence. The wedding will also be covered on the BBC NewsFacebook page,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,externalaccounts throughout the day. On radio, Claire Balding will host live commentary from Windsor Castle onBBC Radio 4from 11:30 BST andRadio 5 livefrom 10:00 BST. Outside the UK, BBC America, BBC Canada and BBC World News will be broadcasting coverage. Or you can tune in on BBC World Service radio. In Windsor, viewing areas will be created along the procession route. There will be live entertainment in the town centre, which will be decorated with bunting and banners. Big screens showing live footage of the wedding will be shown on the Long Walk and in Alexandra Gardens in Windsor. At 13:00 BST, the newlyweds will travel through the town in the Ascot Landau carriage, which is used in official and ceremonial state events. The carriage will leave Castle Hill, travel through Windsor and then proceed up the Long Walk, all the way back to St George's Hall by Windsor Castle. Rail bosses advise that trains will be ""extremely busy"". Queuing systems will be introduced at several stations - most likely London Waterloo, Slough, Staines and the two stations in Windsor - to avoid overcrowding on platforms.

South Western Railway will double its direct Windsor services from London Waterloo to four per hour and use 10-carriage trains. Make sure you get there early, though - Thames Valley Police may order trains not to stop at Windsor if visitor numbers become a safety issue, and the wedding route could be closed off to latecomers. Passengers are also being asked to keep baggage to a minimum as security checks on excess luggage could delay journeys.

"Cladding on the Grenfell Tower was blamed for the spread of the fire Survivors of the Grenfell Tower fire will still be living in emergency accommodation 12 months after the tragedy, the government has confirmed. Housing Secretary James Brokenshire told MPs that of the 210 households affected, 201 had accepted offers of temporary or permanent accommodation. Labour said only a third of families affected were in a permanent home. Meanwhile, the government announced it will fund a Â£400m operation to remove dangerous cladding from tower blocks. Only buildings owned by councils and housing associations will qualify. Duke of Cambridge joins DIY SOS Grenfell crew Visual guide to the Grenfell Tower fire Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? Grenfell: Inside the 21st floor Mr Brokenshire told a Labour-led debate that of the 201 households which had accepted offers of temporary or permanent accommodation, 138 have moved into their accommodation. Of these 138, 64 are in temporary accommodation and 74 in permanent homes. Weeks after the fire on 14 June last year, which killed 71 people, the government said survivors would be offered permanent furnished social housing within 12 months. Mr Brokenshire acknowledged that progress had been ""too slow"" and that it was ""understandable"" that some in the community would feel ""let down"" but said the local council now had 300 properties available ""to those who need them"". Shadow housing secretary John Healey said residents had spoken about being offered properties which were damp, with insufficient bedrooms or on tenancy terms which were different to those they had in Grenfell. ""No-one wants to bring up children in a hotel room,"" he said. During the debate, Labour former minister David Lammy paid tribute to family friend Khadija Saye, a 24-year-old artist who died in the fire. ""She died, frankly, because the state failed her,"" he said. ""The state told her to stay put and she stayed put and when she did leave, even though she got split up from her mother, she didn't quite make it out. ""Had she set about leaving earlier, she probably would be with us today."" Conservative backbencher Kwasi Kwarteng said the government will be judged on its response to the tragedy and warned that the Tory party was at risk of losing the good will of victims of the fire. He told the debate that there was an issue of a ""polarised society"". ""The suspicion today is that as the royal borough has got wealthier and wealthier, the political class, the people running the borough have really forgotten some of the less advantaged members of their community,"" he said. Announcing the funding for replacing cladding during Prime Minister's Questions, Theresa May told MPs that fire and rescue services had visited more than 1,250 tower blocks around the country since the fire. Another resident - who suffered from long-term health issues prior to the disaster - was rescued from the fire but died in hospital in January. Cladding on 228 buildings failed safety testsafter the disaster. On Thursday, Dame Judith Hackitt, the senior engineer responsible for reviewing the building regulations in the wake of the Grenfell fire, will publish her final report. ""As we approach the anniversary of the appalling tragedy that was the Grenfell Tower fire, our thoughts are with the victims and survivors and all those affected by that tragedy,"" added Mrs May. The prime minister said that while councils and housing associations ""must remove dangerous cladding quickly"", the new scheme should not undermine other ""important maintenance and repair work"". Privately-owned tower blocks will not be covered by government funding with residents in some buildings covered in the cladding initially being asked to cover the costs. Leaseholder residents in the Citiscape building in Croydon, south London, wereasked to pay up to Â£31,300 eachin order for the cladding to be replaced butthe tower's developer, Barratt Developments, then said it would pay instead.

"Princess Charlotte comes to the role with experience Three-year-old Princess Charlotte will be one of six young bridesmaids at the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, Kensington Palace has said. Her elder brother, Prince George, aged four, will be a pageboy alongside three other young boys. So far, the details of the bridesmaids' dresses and the pageboys' uniforms remain under wraps. Ms Markle, 36, will not have a maid of honour as she wanted to avoid choosing just one of her closest friends. As well as his niece and nephew, Prince Harry has picked three godchildren - three-year-old Florence van Cutsem, two year-old Zalie Warren and Jasper Dyer, six - to have starring roles on his big day. Jasper is the son of Prince Harry's close friend Mark Dyer, a former royal equerry to Prince Charles, who supported Harry after the death of his mother, Princess Diana. The pair travelled together on Harry's gap year and Mr Dyer inspired the prince's charity work in Lesotho, Africa. Royal wedding: All you need to know Who is Meghan Markle? Meghan's dad may miss wedding over surgery Who else could walk Meghan Markle down the aisle? Ms Markle's goddaughters, Remi Litt, six, and her elder sister, Rylan, seven, will also be joining the procession of bridesmaids. And the three children of one of her best friends, Jessica Mulroney - Ivy, four, and seven-year-old twins Brian and John - will complete the picture. Jessica, a stylist, is married to Ben Mulroney, a Canadian TV host and son of former Canadian prime minister, Brian Mulroney. She was photographed arriving at Heathrow Airport with her family on Tuesday night. Prince George was pageboy at his aunt's wedding Prince George, second from right, concentrates on his duties Prince George, the son of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, will have experience to lean on - he was pageboy at his aunt Pippa Middleton's wedding to James Matthews last May. His sister, Charlotte, a bridesmaid at her aunt's wedding, recently showed she was undaunted by the limelight when she visited her little brother, Prince Louis, at hospital after his birth. With the world's cameras trained on her, she seemed to enjoy the attention, waving sweetly and smiling at the bank of photographers. Meanwhile, a petition organised by campaign group Republic has been handed to MPs. Signed by 32,000 people, the petition calls on MPs to make the Royal Family pay for the security and policing surrounding Saturday's wedding and for the government to publish a report of all costs to taxpayers. This video can not be played ""The royals should be paying for this wedding"" - Republic Republic chief executive Graham Smith said: ""There is nothing inevitable about the public spending on a royal wedding.

"Oxfam chief executive Mark Goldring is to stand down following the scandal involving claims of sexual misconduct by staff in Haiti, the charity says. Mr Goldring, who was criticised for his handling of the claims that aid workers used prostitutes in 2011, said someone else should ""rebuild"" the charity. He has held the position since 2013 and will leave at the end of the year. In a statement Mr Goldring said: ""This journey will best be led by someone bringing fresh vision and energy."" Oxfam deputy quits over Haiti sex claims How will the Haiti scandal affect Oxfam? Oxfam boss denies Haiti 'cover-up' The British charity was accused of concealing the findings of an inquiry into claims staff sexually exploited female victims of the 2010 earthquake in Haiti. An Oxfam spokeswoman said his resignation was ""absolutely not to do with his handling"" of the crisis. Oxfam chairwoman Caroline Thomson said it was with ""great sadness"" she accepted his resignation, adding that he ""faced the test of a lifetime managing the crisis which hit us in February and related to events before he joined"". Mr Goldring appeared in front of MPs that month, apologising for the actions of staff and also for his own comment to the Guardian that the charity was being attacked as if it had ""murdered babies in their cots"". He denied there had been a cover-up and also said he would not step down unless the charity's board lost faith in his leadership. This video can not be played Mark Goldring: 'We are sorry for the damage done to Haiti and the wider aid efforts' Oxfam's deputy chief executive, Penny Lawrence, resigned in February over the handling of the claims. The allegations,reported in The Times,,externalsaid Oxfam's country director for Haiti, Roland van Hauwermeiren, used the services of prostitutes at a villa rented for him by Oxfam in the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake. According to the paper, Oxfam knew about concerns over the conduct of Mr van Hauwermeiren and another man when they worked in Chad before they were given senior roles in Haiti. The charity's own investigation in 2011 led to four people being sacked and three others resigning, including Mr van Hauwermeiren. It produced a public report, which said ""serious misconduct"" had taken place in Haiti - but did not give details of the allegations. In announcing his resignation, Mr Goldring said: ""Following the very public exposure of Oxfam's past failings, we have redoubled our efforts to ensure that Oxfam is a safe and respectful place for all who have contact with us. ""We are now laying strong foundations for recovery. I am personally totally committed to seeing this phase through. ""However, what is important in 2019 and beyond is that Oxfam rebuilds and renews in a way that is most relevant for the future and so continues to help as many people as possible around the world build better lives.""

"This video can not be played Why North Korea is angry at this man The Trump administration is hopeful its summit with North Korea will go ahead, despite threats of cancellation. A White House spokesperson said the US president remained ready. Hours earlier, North Korea released an angry statement saying it might pull out of the meeting if the US insisted it gave up its nuclear weapons unilaterally. The highly anticipated meeting between Mr Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong-un is due to take place on 12 June. ""The president is ready if the meeting takes place,"" said White House spokesperson Sarah Sanders. ""If it doesn't, we'll continue the maximum pressure campaign that's been ongoing."" When asked if it would go ahead, Mr Trump later said: ""We'll have to see"". He reiterated that the US would still insist on denuclearisation. Analysis: This is Kim's warning shot to the White House North Korea crisis in 300 words The groundbreaking agreement for Mr Kim and Mr Trump to meet came about as North Korea said it was committed to denuclearising the Korean peninsula. Exactly what that would entail has remained unclear but North Korea has invited foreign media to witness the dismantling of its main nuclear test site later this month. North Korea's statement, carried by state media, said the country had had high expectations from the summit, but it was ""totally disappointed"" by recent reckless remarks from the US. What Kim wants Read North Korea's statement in full It pointed the finger squarely at US National Security Adviser John Bolton. ""We do not hide our feeling of repugnance towards him,"" said the statement, which was written by Vice-Foreign Minister Kim Kye-gwan. The words of Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un are being closely followed on South Korean television In a television interview at the weekend, Mr Bolton said North Korea could follow a ""Libya model"" of verifiable denuclearisation, but this alarms Pyongyang, which watched Libya's Colonel Gaddafi give up his nuclear programme only for him to be killed by Western-backed rebels a few years later. After the North Korean outburst, Mr Bolton told Fox News Radio that the odds are still in favour of the meeting going ahead. ""We are trying to be both optimistic and realistic at the same time,"" he said. By Laura Bicker, BBC News, Seoul Nuclear weapons have been central to North Korean ideology for its entire history The whole reason the North Korean state has spent years building up a nuclear arsenal, at such a great cost, is for survival. So to compare denuclearisation in North Korea with Libya or indeed Iraq as John Bolton did on Sunday is not going to offer much comfort.Both regimes collapsed. This is also a warning shot to the Trump administration. They will be aware how much Mr Trump wants this summit and how it is being spun as a success brought about by his maximum pressure strategy. There were signs this boasting irritated Pyongyang, but now it has decided to speak out through someone in a position of power. The release of three Americans from prison was a major concession by North Korea North Korea wants the world to know that it is coming to the negotiating table from a position of strength, and they may feel that they are making all the concessions. They've suspended all missile tests,released the three US detainees, Kim Jong-un met President Moonand the pair signed a declaration, and they're about to dismantle a nuclear test site in front of international media. So to hear the Trump administration claiming credit for a deal they don't like has been a step too far. These statements more than hint that North Korea is prepared to walk away from President Trump's summit in Singapore until it does hear a deal it does like. Kim Kye-gwan said:  ""If the US is trying to drive us into a corner to force our unilateral nuclear abandonment, we will no longer be interested in such dialogue."" The vice-foreign minister is known to be highly respected in the North Korean leadership and has taken part in negotiations with the US before. There is very little chance his comments were not personally endorsed by Kim Jong-un. Will historic Koreas summit lead to peace? Hours before the announcement, in a sign of growing problems,North Korea had also pulled out of a meeting scheduled with South Korea on Wednesdaybecause of anger over the start of US-South Korea joint military drills. A Chinese government spokesman urged North Korea and the US to ""meet each other halfway"" ahead of negotiations. This video can not be played Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un: From enemies to frenemies The hawkish conservative is a firm defender of US power and a confrontational advocate for wielding that strength abroad. He has previously said it would be ""perfectly legitimate"" to carry out a pre-emptive strike on North Korea. In media interviews over the weekend, he said North Korea could follow a Libyan model of nuclear disarmament - Libya gave up its weapons' programmes in the early 2000s and only then secured economic aid and normalised relations with the US. However during the 2011 uprising against Colonel Gaddafi's regime, Western powers intervened in Libya in favour of the rebels, and Gaddafi was captured and killed.

"Three of Nassar's victims (L-R) - Jade Capua, Kyle Stephens, Alexis Moore - confronted Nassar in court earlier this year Michigan State University has agreed to pay $500m (Â£371m) to gymnasts who were abused by ex-team doctor Larry Nassar. The deal was announced by a California law firm representing 332 victims of Nassar, who assaulted women and girls under the guise of medical treatment. The deal does not include any non-disclosure or confidentiality agreements, according to a statement from lawyers and the university. It does not address allegations against other groups for which Nassar worked. It does not address claims against USA Gymnastics, the US Olympic Committee, or the owners of the Texas facility where gymnasts trained, according to a statement from the California law firm of Manly, Stewart & Finaldi in Los Angeles. According to the lawyers, $425m will be paid to the claimants, and another $75m would be set aside for any future allegations against Nassar, 54, and the university. The lawyers' statement does not address how the money will be allocated to each of Nassar's accusers. The 156 women who confronted a predator Why are some US prison sentences so long? ""This historic settlement came about through the bravery of more than 300 women and girls who had the courage to stand up and refuse to be silenced,"" attorney John Manly said in the statement on Wednesday. He added that it is their ""hope"" that ""the legacy of this settlement"" will serve to eradicate abuse in US sport. The university's board chairman Brian Breslin also issued a written statement saying: ""We are truly sorry to all the survivors and their families for what they have been through, and we admire the courage it has taken to tell their stories."" This video can not be played What it was like to testify against Larry Nassar ""We recognise the need for change on our campus and in our community around sexual assault awareness and prevention"" he continued. Analysis by Rajini Vaidyanathan, BBC News, Washington Many of the young women who survived Larry Nassar's sexual abuse weren't just angry at what he had done to them, but at the institutions they felt had enabled him. Michigan State University was where he worked for decades, and many of the young gymnasts felt their complaints to staff there went ignored. This settlement is an acknowledgement from the university that they could have done things so very differently. But for some survivors, like Rachel Denhollander, the first woman to go public with her story, there is a long way to go. She says she is grateful for the settlement, but disappointed at the ""missed opportunity for reform"" at the university. For so many of the women I watched in court throughout the harrowing sentencing earlier this year, speaking out wasn't just about getting justice for themselves - but about changing attitudes and processes so other survivors of abuse have a voice too. The president of USA Gymnastics, which oversees the US Olympic team, as well as the entire board of directors resigned after at least 156 women came forward to testify against the disgraced ex-doctor. Earlier this year, the university's president and director of athletics resigned amid claims that school officials had been told of allegations against Nassar years ago but failed to act. Michigan police apologise to Nassar victim Former president Lou Anna Simon denied claims of a university cover-up as she stepped down on the same day that Nassar was sentenced for his crimes. The settlement surpasses the $109m that Penn State University agree to pay in 2017 to settle claims by at least 35 people against American football coach Jerry Sandusky. Nassar, 54, was sentenced to more than 100 years in prison for abusing female athletes he was supposed to be treating Nassar is currently being held in federal jail and will likely remain there for the rest of his life. He is serving a 60-year sentence for child pornography. If he is ever released he faces up to 175 years in state jail for sexual assault.

"A member of the Windrush generation says he was left ""broken"" after being wrongly detained in an immigration centre because he was unable to prove he had a right to live in the UK. Anthony Bryan, 60, came from Jamaica in 1965 but last year was threatened with deportation by the Home Office. He spoke to MPs and peers with Paulette Wilson, who had a similar experience. Mr Bryan agreed with a suggestion that a factor in the way he was treated was because he was black. He was asked by Labour peer Baroness Lawrence if he thought things would have been different if he had been from Canada, New Zealand or Australia, to which he replied: ""I hate to say it, but I don't think I would have this problem"". Sixty-three Windrush migrants 'removed' New home secretary in Windrush vow Who are the Windrush generation? When she asked him if he saw ""race as being a big part"" in what happened, he said: ""In the Home Office? Yes."" The murder of Mrs Lawrence's son Stephen in 1993 led to an inquiry which found there had been institutional racism in the Metropolitan Police. Mr Bryan, a grandfather from north London, was held in a detention centre twice, for almost three weeks, last year. His difficulties began when he lost his job after receiving a letter informing him he had no right to remain, despite having lived in the UK since he was eight. This video can not be played Windrush migrants: We weren't believed Mr Bryan told a parliamentary committee how he had phoned his family from the detention centre to tell them: ""It looks like you're going to see me in Jamaica."" He continued: ""They had tickets for me - I thought I was going, to be honest."" ""I was resigned because I couldn't fight any more. I just gave up,"" he told the Joint Committee on Human Rights. He said he explained to the officials who came to detain him at his home that he had lived in the UK for most of his life, adding: ""But to them I was lying... everything I was telling them, I had to prove that"". Mr Bryan, who was accompanied at the hearing by his partner Janet McKay-Williams, was released from the immigration centre in November after a last-minute intervention from a lawyer. Stories of Commonwealth migrants who arrived in the UK legally as children between the late 1940s and 1973, but have no formal documentation to prove they have the right to remain in the country, have emerged in recent weeks. The Windrush generation is named after the ship that brought the first arrivals to Britain from the Caribbean in 1948. This video can not be played A look back at life when the Windrush generation arrived in the UK Grandmother Ms Wilson, 61, from Wolverhampton, gave evidence to the MPs and peers on the committee alongside her daughter, Natalie Barnes. She said that without the efforts of her daughter ""I would be in Jamaica, all alone"". Ms Wilson had been looked after by her grandparents in Wellington, Telford, when she first arrived in Britain from Jamaica in 1968 at the age of 10. She received a letter from the Home Office in 2015 and was told to report each month to immigration officials.  In October last year she was detained and taken to the Yarl's Wood immigration removal centre, where she spent a week before being released. Ms Wilson said: ""The first thing I got was a letter saying I was an illegal immigrant. At the time I didn't understand it but it took me about a week before I could show my daughter I had got this letter. ""They were saying I don't belong here - I've got six months to get out."" Referring to the decision to detain her, Ms Wilson told the committee: ""Where could I have run to? My family is here in England. I wouldn't have run away."" ""I was thinking they were going to pick me up here and put me on the plane and probably when I get there people's going to kill me.  I was thinking all sorts of things in my head."" Ms Barnes said ""documents were very hard to come by, They kept telling us to go here, there and everywhere... it was just very hard to get that evidence"". Woman resident in UK since 1968 freed Committee chairwoman Harriet Harman said she would write to Home Secretary Sajid Javid to get the Home Office to give Mr Bryan and Ms Wilson their files so they could see the information that officials had about them. The home secretary said this week that63 members of the Windrush generation could have been wrongfully removedor deported from the UK since 2002.

"Mr Zuckerberg's visit to Brussels will be less public than his testimony to Congress last month Facebook has confirmed its chief executive will meet leading members of the European Parliament to discuss privacy concerns in Brussels. The date of the meeting with Mark Zuckerberg has yet to be fixed butthe president of the European Parliament said he hoped it would be next week,external. The talks will be held behind closed doors at a meeting of the Conference of Presidents attended by leaders of the various political groups. A follow-up public hearing is planned. But this later event, which is likely to be in June, will be attended by different Facebook executives. The social network has been embroiled in a data privacy scandal since it emerged that it had not checked that millions of users' personal details had been deleted after being shared with Cambridge Analytica. The London-based political consultancyannounced it would shut earlier this month. The French president is also set to meet Mr Zuckerberg in Paris on 23 May. Mr Zuckerberg previously visited Paris in 2011 when he met President Nicolas Sarkozy Emmanuel Macron's office said the two men would have ""frank"" talks about data privacy and tax. The leaders of Microsoft, Intel and IBM are also set to attend the one-day Tech for Good summit at the Elysee Palace. Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data scandal UK watchdog seeks Cambridge Analytica data Will data scandal firm return from the dead? Mr Zuckerberg will not, however, be visiting the UK. He has refused a request to testify before Westminster's Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, which had complained that an earlier appearance by his chief technology officer had failed to yield enough detail. ""Although Facebook says Mr Zuckerberg has no plans to travel to the UK, we would also be open to taking his evidence by video link, if that would be the only way to do this during the period of our inquiry,"" wrote the committee's chair, Damian Collins MP, in response.,external A spokeswoman for Facebook was unable to say whom else Mr Zuckerberg would meet or where he would travel while in Europe. But she gave the following statement: ""We have accepted the Council of President's proposal to meet with leaders of the European Parliament and appreciate the opportunity for dialogue, to listen to their views and show the steps we are taking to better protect people's privacy."" The arrangements have displeased parliament's Brexit negotiator, who also serves as the leader of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe.

"Meghan Markle's family has found itself on the world stage ahead of her wedding to Prince Harry on Saturday. As moredoubt is cast on whether her father will attendthe ceremony, the Royal Family's closely-controlled media operation has at times seemed to be unravelling. How has Kensington Palace, the office and residence of Prince Harry, which has rolled out the royal wedding plans and strategy over the past few months, dropped the ball so spectacularly in the last four days? This was going to be a different wedding - no massed ranks of dignitaries, no traditional wedding cake, members of the public invited to view the happy just-married couple, sustainable, seasonably and renewably sourced victuals. Over the last couple of months announcements have come and gone, by and large slavishly followed by broadcasters, newspapers and websites well aware of the interest of the audience. And now this. The usual tactic of the palace is to say nothing about stories that come up that run counter to the royal narrative, and wait for them to go away. Royal wedding: All you need to know Who is Meghan Markle? Meghan's dad may miss wedding over surgery Royal wedding: In the shadow of Diana Given that there are so few reliable sources for real royal news, and that broadcasters are unhappy running stories on rumour and conjecture alone, it was by and large a winning strategy. But with the entertainment website TMZ apparently having a hotline to the father of the bride, the palace's near-monopoly on information has been broken. TMZ has functioned as a rival press office, issuing apparently well-sourced bulletins on Thomas Markle's health and state of mind that left the palace blindsided. The response to 24 hours that entirely contradicted the previously stated plan for the wedding? No comment. Who will walk the bride down the aisle? No comment. What on Earth is going on? No comment. The news from Mexico has been harder for the palace to control Amongst the many who are now ever-so-wise after the event, there are questions. How could the palace have let Mr Markle fall into a paparazzi trap? Why wasn't someone sent out to mind him? But was someone really going to sit in a town outside Tijuana for six months, fighting off photographers? And maybe a man who is clearly not wild on company didn't really fancy that? The BBC understands but has been unable to confirm that Kensington Palace did offer assistance to Thomas Markle in the months running up to Saturday's wedding. The presumption must be that he declined it. The palace media operations are not that big, sometimes (like many press offices) not that good, and they operate by and large on precedent. We do it like this because we've always done it like this; this is public and we will comment, this is private and we will not comment. That means they don't appear to think strategy as much as they might, and they don't seem to have had a contingency plan for what might happen with Ms Markle's family. The families of previous brides understood the rules, even if as so-called commoners they knew that a single narrative of the wedding would preserve the event. And they knew that if they stepped out of line they would be out in the cold. Royal fans are already securing viewing spots in Windsor But Ms Markle's extended family - most of them with little left to lose as they haven't seen the bride for many a moon and will spend the wedding in TV studios rather than in St George's Chapel - are different. They have descended en masse on Britain, all with stories to tell and bank balances to improve. And the previous reliance on the palace for titbits - that cake recipe, those flowers, that photographer - has vanished like dew on a spring morning. At some point - presumably soon, as the current situation (""no comment"") is untenable at this late date - there will be resolution. An announcement will come as to who will do what on the day. And the hope of the palace - probably well-founded - will be that the long-planned mechanics of the occasion will drown out the discord of the past four days. But for the moment there is that thing that nature abhors, a vacuum. And every well-laid plan of the palace is consumed by the soap-opera drama playing out well beyond its control.

"Saturday marks a new chapter in the lives of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle - and the couple are expected to receive new titles ahead of their wedding. Along with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, William and Kate were given the Scottish titles Earl and Countess of Strathearn - seen as a nod to their time at the University of St Andrews - and the Northern Irish titles of Baron and Baroness of Carrickfergus. So, what are Harry and Meghan likely to receive? ""Prince William was given English, Scottish and Irish titles but it is more likely Prince Harry will only get English and Scottish titles,"" says Lucy Hume, associate editor of Debrett's Peerage and Baronetage. ""He is the younger son and not directly in line to the throne. ""There are a limited number of dormant or extinct peerages or titles available and it is most likely Prince Harry will be given the title of 'duke' in England - and it may be as well that he receives a title in Scotland such as 'earl'."" Royal wedding 2018: Meghan's father to have surgery Who else could walk Meghan down the aisle? 'Why I walked myself down the aisle' For Harry and Meghan's main title, the Queen is expected to choose from one of the vacant dukedoms. Vacancies include the dukedoms of Clarence, Connaught, Kendal, Ross, Sussex and Windsor. There are also a number of unoccupied, dormant dukedoms including Cumberland and Albany. Ms Hume continues: ""Factors that might be taken into account include who held the title previously and whether there are any negative connotations, but ultimately it is the Queen's decision based on advice from her staff."" The dukedom of Windsor is one that could be seen to have ""negative connotations"" as it was the title given to Edward VIII after his abdication in 1936. Both bookmakers and royal experts feel the dukedom of Sussex is the most likely option. The dukedom of Clarence is the bookmakers' second favourite. ""The Duke of Sussex was a title that became extinct around 200 years ago,"" says Ms Hume. ""The previous holder of the title didn't have any legitimate heirs and there is no terrible or controversial history associated with the title."" The previous Duke of Sussex lived between 1773 and 1843 The previous Duke of Sussex was Prince Augustus Frederick, the sixth son and ninth child of George III. Like Harry and Meghan, the duke lived in Kensington Palace. He died in 1843, aged 70. Augustus twice married for love but his father did not approve of either match and so did not give his consent to either marriage. As a result, neither of the duke's children were considered legitimate heirs to his title. Any titles given to Harry and Meghan are likely to be little more than that. William and Kate were each given three titles but none of them came with land or powers. Though there are currently six royal dukes in the UK, there are only two royal duchies, or territories associated with a dukedom. Ms Hume says: ""There is the Duchy of Cornwall, which belongs to the Prince of Wales, and the Duchy of Lancaster, which belongs to the Queen. ""Those do have private estates attached to them and the Queen and Prince of Wales derive an income from them but those are the only ones.""

"There is a terrible shadow hanging over this wedding; the same shadow that hung over Harry for so long; the same shadow that hangs still over the House of Windsor and the writers and photographers who chronicle it. It is the shadow of Diana, Princess of Wales. Much has been made of Meghan Markle's ease with the pressures of the modern media. She is a hugely impressive communicator, in front of the microphones and cameras, and through social media. She has worked her way up in film and TV to a leading role in a successful show. Along the way there have been countless interviews, tours and fan conventions. She will, it is said, be at ease with the day-in, day-out exposure that goes along with being a high profile member of the Royal Family. That is nonsense. She was a success in the legal drama Suits and she made a decent name for herself there. But she was not Hollywood royalty, and she was stalked neither by photographers nor by gossip websites. She lived in the relative quiet of Toronto, she shopped and ate out where she wanted and when she wanted with little or no disturbance. Markle sister hopes dad will go to wedding Royal wedding: All you need to know The globe-trotting Harry and Meghan fans No one thought to stake out her father's house in Mexico, no one thought to pay her estranged relatives for interviews, no one made up stories about her childhood neighbourhood. When she stepped out of her house she didn't face a barrage of long lenses and shouted questions. She had a pretty normal life and press exposure was controlled, on her terms and those of her publicists. Prince Harry knew what was coming. Whatever smiles he manages with the press, he remembers the extraordinary attention his late mother Diana received - attention she cultivated as well as suffered from. Courtiers speak of his abiding distrust of the media. Previous partners of his recoiled in horror at the exposure that being ""Harry's Girl"" brought. Relationships appeared to crumble under the weight of unceasing comment, speculation and intrusion into the lives of friends and family. Maybe Meghan Markle seemed different. She is strong and independent, like previous partners, like his mother Diana. But she is also older, more mature, more confident in how she handles herself and what she wants to do with her life. ""I've never wanted to be a lady who lunches,"" she said, ""I've always wanted to be a lady who works"". Very different from most royal brides. But as soon as the relationship was public, it was open season on Ms Markle. And on her friends and family Prince Harry made his anger - fury, by all accounts - clear with a public statement in November 2016denouncing the intrusion. His office detailed some of it: ""â¦ [Meghan Markle's] mother having to struggle past photographers to get to her front doorâ¦ the substantial bribes offered to her ex-boyfriend, the bombardment of nearly every friend, co-worker and loved one in her life"". It made no difference. To newspapers, photographers and websites, everyone connected to her was fair game. And however strong Ms Markle might be, her relatives were always going to be weaker. In Westminster Abbey, more than two decades ago, Diana's brother described his sister as the most hunted person of her age. Now, just days before her wedding, Ms Markle and her relatives hear the hounds at their feet.

"Thomas Baty (left) and Thomas Howard complained of breathing difficulties on Sunday after going to a nightclub Police in Sri Lanka are investigating whether drugs contributed to the death of a British amateur rugby player who died in the country. Thomas Howard, 25, from Durham and team-mate Thomas Baty, 26, died after visiting a nightclub in Colombo during a rugby tour. Post-mortem tests on Mr Howard found no injury or natural causes for his death. Further tests have been ordered but police confirmed to the BBC they were looking at whether drugs played a part. The BBC has also seen a preliminary report into Mr Howard's post-mortem examination, which states the cause of his death needs further investigation. Tissue, blood and other samples have been sent for analysis, it confirms. Sri Lankan health minister Rajitha Senarathane said the chief judicial medical officer ""couldn't find the correct diagnosis for the cause of the death"". ""From the post-mortem they can't find anything so they have taken certain organs of the body and they have sent it to the government analysts,"" he said. Second rugby player dies in Sri Lanka British rugby player dies in Sri Lanka Asked what might have cause their deaths, he said: ""They have played rugger, so they would be exhausted enough. ""After that, they were without sleep until early morning in a night club."" Both players died in Colombo's Nawaloka Hospital The men had been touring the country with Durham-based Clems Pirates RFC and begun with a game against Ceylonese Rugby and Football Club (CRFC) in Colombo. Former Sri Lanka and CRFC player Pavithra Fernando, who was supposed to play in the match but had had a cold, said there had been ""no issues"" during the game. ""After the match all of us had a friendly drink together in the club and they left around 11pm,"" he said. Sri Lankan police said some British players went to Colombo's Cleopatra nightclub after the match and returned to their hotel in the early hours of Sunday.

"The body of 85-year-old Rosina Coleman was found at her home in Romford An 85-year-old woman has been found dead in her home after a ""cowardly assault"", police have said. A handyman working at the address in Ashmour Gardens in Romford, east London, found the body of Rosina Coleman at about 11:30 BST on Tuesday. Friends and neighbours described the mother of two as ""the nicest person you could hope to meet"" who was ""always happy"". Murder detectives have not yet made any arrests. Det Insp Paul Considine, who is leading the investigation, said police believe Mrs Coleman was attacked between 07:30 and 11:30 on Tuesday. He added: ""This is a despicable incident in which the victim, an elderly lady who lived alone, had been subjected to a cowardly assault that left her with serious injuries. ""It is imperative that we find those responsible for this horrendous offence."" A police cordon is still in place in Ashmour Gardens in east London Neighbours said Mrs Coleman had lived on the street for more than 40 years with her husband Bill, who died about 11 years ago. Alan Mckeown, who lives on the adjacent street, said she was ""the nicest person you could hope to meet"". He said he would often pass Mrs Coleman while walking his dog and ""she always wanted to have a good chat"". He added: ""I thought she must have had a heart attack or something. I didn't dream of anything untoward like this. ""It's barbaric, absolutely barbaric."" Jackie Harwood, 72, said she used to meet Mrs Coleman on Saturdays at the local British Legion. ""She was a lovely person who was always happy, always dancing,"" she added. ""She was popular and would cook bread pudding and bring it in for everyone. She would always talk about her family as well."" Rosina Coleman's next-of-kin have been informed Forensics officers are still coming in and out of the semi-detached bungalow where Rosina Coleman lived alone. Her neighbours tell me she was popular and well-liked. Ashmour Gardens is a quiet residential street with children out playing on their bikes and people walking their dogs. Those that stopped to talk said they were shocked something like this happened here. Another neighbour, who did not wish to be named, said Mrs Coleman was a seamstress who sewed all of her own clothes and made a suit a week. He added: ""It's such a sad thing. I can't get my head around it. I can't think of anybody that would want to harm her."" A police forensics tent has been erected in the garden of the property, with a tarpaulin sheet drawn across one of the glass windows. Officers have also searched nearby drains and bushes.

"The Bank of England's deputy governor has admitted his comments that the UK economy is entering a ""menopausal"" era ""conveyed ageist and sexist overtones"". Ben Broadbent used the phrase in aDaily Telegraph interview,externalabout economies that were, he said, ""past their peak, and no longer so potent"". But in an internal message seen by the BBC he said he knew some bank staff had been offended and he was ""truly sorry"". He told colleagues he should not have used the word. ""I recognise that while these are economic terms that have been used in the past, my use of the word ""menopausal"" conveyed ageist and sexist overtones and I should not have used it"", he wrote on the Bank's internal website. ""I was attempting to explain the meaning of the world ""climacteric"". As the journalist who was interviewing me has subsequently tweeted, I made it clear in the interview that this is a term which applies to both genders. He said he wanted to ""emphasise how sorry I am for the offence my interview this morning has caused to Bank colleagues"". Earlier he had issued a public apology. In it he said he was sorry for his ""poor choice of language"" and the ""offence caused"". He said productivity affected ""every one of us, of all ages and genders"". But his comments have sparked a backlash. Sarah Smith, professor of economics at Bristol University, told the BBC they were ""not useful"". Silvana Tenreyo is the only female member of the Monetary Policy Committee ""It conveys a rather derogatory view of women. I've never thought of the menopause as not productive,"" she said. Carolyn Fairbairn, director-general of the CBI, called it a ""poor choice of words"" that distracted from the real issue at hand. Jayne-Anne Gadhia, boss of Virgin Money UK, said: ""When I read this I thought about my own menopause and was sure he meant that the future is hard work, challenging, renewing, worth fighting for, 100% positive and constantly HOT!"" And TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: ""There's no need to resort to lazy, sexist comments to describe problems in the economy."" Mr Broadbent sits on the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), which has been criticised for having only one female member on its nine-strong board. The economist is also thought to be to among a number of potential successors to the Bank's governor, Mark Carney. The bank faced a backlash in 2013 over female representation on banknotes. In his interview, Mr Broadbent compared a recent slowdown in UK productivity to a similar lull at the end of the 1800s, which has been described as a ""climacteric"" period. The term, which is borrowed from biology and is used for both sexes, means ""you've passed your productive peak"", the deputy governor said. He suggested that the UK may be seeing a ""pause"" between two technological leaps forward - akin to one experienced by late-Victorian industrialists from steam to electricity. However, he said the economy could be awaiting its next big breakthrough, possibly as a result of Artificial Intelligence. Mr Broadbent later stressed that his use of the word menopausal had only applied to the 19th Century. The Bank's attitude towards women has been questioned in the past.

"Every Govia Thameslink train time is being changed The time of every train on Britain's largest rail franchise, Govia Thameslink (GTR), will change as part of a major shake-up. Arrival and departure times are being re-set from Sunday and some services will call at different stations. Some signal workers have claimed it is going to be ""a disaster"", the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union said. GTR said nearly 400 extra trains each day would bring ""a significant boost"". The company said it would be running about 3,600 trains across its network - which includes Southern rail, Gatwick Express, Thameslink and Great Northern. But an RMT member said thenew timetable,externalwould slow down services by allowing more catch-up time on routes and more turnaround time at stations. This video can not be played A BBC investigation discovered Govia Thameslink was the worst for 'station skipping' The union, which recently marked two years of its dispute with GTR over the role of guards, warned there was potential for massive disruption to the ""core"" area of London, from London Bridge to St Pancras. RMT general secretary Mick Cash said the new timetable would place massive strains on infrastructure and staffing levels already under pressure and accused GTR of ""winging it with potentially disastrous consequences"". Timetable 'earthquake' to hit in May Trains missed stops '160 times a day' Protest over two-year Southern rail row GTR has urged passengers to check their plans before they travel. Chief executive Charles Horton said: ""We don't want passengers to get caught out and so we strongly advise them to look up the times of their trains as they will find that from 20 May each and every one of them has changed. ""Due to the sheer scale of the changes, we will have to redeploy a large number of trains and crews and services may not run at normal times during the introductory phase, although the impact on peak-time services during the transition will be minimal."" The RMT union recently marked two years of its dispute with Govia Thameslink GTR has promised ""huge benefits"" with space for an extra 50,000 morning peak-time passengers travelling into London. It said 80 more stations would have direct services to central London stations by next year.

"A member of the Windrush generation says he was left ""broken"" after being wrongly detained in an immigration centre because he was unable to prove he had a right to live in the UK. Anthony Bryan, 60, came from Jamaica in 1965 but last year was threatened with deportation by the Home Office. He spoke to MPs and peers with Paulette Wilson, who had a similar experience. Mr Bryan agreed with a suggestion that a factor in the way he was treated was because he was black. He was asked by Labour peer Baroness Lawrence if he thought things would have been different if he had been from Canada, New Zealand or Australia, to which he replied: ""I hate to say it, but I don't think I would have this problem"". Sixty-three Windrush migrants 'removed' New home secretary in Windrush vow Who are the Windrush generation? When she asked him if he saw ""race as being a big part"" in what happened, he said: ""In the Home Office? Yes."" The murder of Mrs Lawrence's son Stephen in 1993 led to an inquiry which found there had been institutional racism in the Metropolitan Police. Mr Bryan, a grandfather from north London, was held in a detention centre twice, for almost three weeks, last year. His difficulties began when he lost his job after receiving a letter informing him he had no right to remain, despite having lived in the UK since he was eight. This video can not be played Windrush migrants: We weren't believed Mr Bryan told a parliamentary committee how he had phoned his family from the detention centre to tell them: ""It looks like you're going to see me in Jamaica."" He continued: ""They had tickets for me - I thought I was going, to be honest."" ""I was resigned because I couldn't fight any more. I just gave up,"" he told the Joint Committee on Human Rights. He said he explained to the officials who came to detain him at his home that he had lived in the UK for most of his life, adding: ""But to them I was lying... everything I was telling them, I had to prove that"". Mr Bryan, who was accompanied at the hearing by his partner Janet McKay-Williams, was released from the immigration centre in November after a last-minute intervention from a lawyer. Stories of Commonwealth migrants who arrived in the UK legally as children between the late 1940s and 1973, but have no formal documentation to prove they have the right to remain in the country, have emerged in recent weeks. The Windrush generation is named after the ship that brought the first arrivals to Britain from the Caribbean in 1948. This video can not be played A look back at life when the Windrush generation arrived in the UK Grandmother Ms Wilson, 61, from Wolverhampton, gave evidence to the MPs and peers on the committee alongside her daughter, Natalie Barnes. She said that without the efforts of her daughter ""I would be in Jamaica, all alone"". Ms Wilson had been looked after by her grandparents in Wellington, Telford, when she first arrived in Britain from Jamaica in 1968 at the age of 10. She received a letter from the Home Office in 2015 and was told to report each month to immigration officials.  In October last year she was detained and taken to the Yarl's Wood immigration removal centre, where she spent a week before being released. Ms Wilson said: ""The first thing I got was a letter saying I was an illegal immigrant. At the time I didn't understand it but it took me about a week before I could show my daughter I had got this letter. ""They were saying I don't belong here - I've got six months to get out."" Referring to the decision to detain her, Ms Wilson told the committee: ""Where could I have run to? My family is here in England. I wouldn't have run away."" ""I was thinking they were going to pick me up here and put me on the plane and probably when I get there people's going to kill me.  I was thinking all sorts of things in my head."" Ms Barnes said ""documents were very hard to come by, They kept telling us to go here, there and everywhere... it was just very hard to get that evidence"". Woman resident in UK since 1968 freed Committee chairwoman Harriet Harman said she would write to Home Secretary Sajid Javid to get the Home Office to give Mr Bryan and Ms Wilson their files so they could see the information that officials had about them. The home secretary said this week that63 members of the Windrush generation could have been wrongfully removedor deported from the UK since 2002. But Mr Javid, who took over the post last month afterAmber Rudd resigned, told MPs he did not have information on how many Windrush immigrants had been detained. What is Windrush Day?

"Safaa Boular denies two counts of preparing acts of terrorism A teenage girl who allegedly planned to marry an Islamic State fighter in Syria sobbed uncontrollably after hearing he had been killed, a court has heard. The Old Bailey was played a secret recording of Safaa Boular breaking down in April 2017 when she was told that Naweed Hussain had died in a bombing. The court also heard how her mother and older sister consoled her and encouraged her to celebrate the death. Ms Boular, 18, denies two counts of preparing acts of terrorism. She has been accused of planning to travel to Syria to join IS militants and later preparing to carry out a terrorist attack in London after Hussain's death. Defence lawyers have told the jury Ms Boular was sexually groomed and manipulated by Hussain, a Briton from Coventry, who was twice her age. The defendant's sister, Rizlaine Boular, has already admitted planning a knife attack, while her mother, Mina Dich, has admitted assisting her. Prosecutors told the jury that Ms Boular received the news of Hussain's death in a message from a British undercover officer who was posing as a fighter. At this point, the bug in the family's flat in Vauxhall, south-west London, picked up the reaction of Ms Boular, as well as her 21-year-old sister and her mother. ""Oh my gosh, oh my gosh!"" said Ms Boular, before beginning to scream and cry. ""Rejoice, he is a martyr,"" said an unidentifiable voice. The court heard commotion and shouts before Ms Boular's mother began to frantically and repeatedly pray. ""Listen it's what you wanted,"" said Rizlaine Boular. ""Many people envy you."" ""To me he's everything,"" sobbed Ms Boular. ""I can't take anymore."" As her daughter continued to cry, sometimes hysterically, Mina Dich declared that Hussain was now ""in paradise"". ""Rejoice, rejoice, rejoice,"" she said. Rizlaine Boular added: ""We are a step closer... Imagine if your appointment was first, you'd be happily waiting. He's waiting for you... We are so proud of you."" ""I am going to die right now,"" said Ms Boular. ""I am happy thanks to God - I love him so much."" Later that month all three women were arrested for terrorism offences. The trial continues.

"The Bank of England's deputy governor has admitted his comments that the UK economy is entering a ""menopausal"" era ""conveyed ageist and sexist overtones"". Ben Broadbent used the phrase in aDaily Telegraph interview,externalabout economies that were, he said, ""past their peak, and no longer so potent"". But in an internal message seen by the BBC he said he knew some bank staff had been offended and he was ""truly sorry"". He told colleagues he should not have used the word. ""I recognise that while these are economic terms that have been used in the past, my use of the word ""menopausal"" conveyed ageist and sexist overtones and I should not have used it"", he wrote on the Bank's internal website. ""I was attempting to explain the meaning of the world ""climacteric"". As the journalist who was interviewing me has subsequently tweeted, I made it clear in the interview that this is a term which applies to both genders. He said he wanted to ""emphasise how sorry I am for the offence my interview this morning has caused to Bank colleagues"". Earlier he had issued a public apology. In it he said he was sorry for his ""poor choice of language"" and the ""offence caused"". He said productivity affected ""every one of us, of all ages and genders"". But his comments have sparked a backlash. Sarah Smith, professor of economics at Bristol University, told the BBC they were ""not useful"". Silvana Tenreyo is the only female member of the Monetary Policy Committee ""It conveys a rather derogatory view of women. I've never thought of the menopause as not productive,"" she said. Carolyn Fairbairn, director-general of the CBI, called it a ""poor choice of words"" that distracted from the real issue at hand. Jayne-Anne Gadhia, boss of Virgin Money UK, said: ""When I read this I thought about my own menopause and was sure he meant that the future is hard work, challenging, renewing, worth fighting for, 100% positive and constantly HOT!"" And TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: ""There's no need to resort to lazy, sexist comments to describe problems in the economy."" Mr Broadbent sits on the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), which has been criticised for having only one female member on its nine-strong board. The economist is also thought to be to among a number of potential successors to the Bank's governor, Mark Carney. The bank faced a backlash in 2013 over female representation on banknotes. In his interview, Mr Broadbent compared a recent slowdown in UK productivity to a similar lull at the end of the 1800s, which has been described as a ""climacteric"" period. The term, which is borrowed from biology and is used for both sexes, means ""you've passed your productive peak"", the deputy governor said. He suggested that the UK may be seeing a ""pause"" between two technological leaps forward - akin to one experienced by late-Victorian industrialists from steam to electricity. However, he said the economy could be awaiting its next big breakthrough, possibly as a result of Artificial Intelligence. Mr Broadbent later stressed that his use of the word menopausal had only applied to the 19th Century. The Bank's attitude towards women has been questioned in the past. In 2013 the Bank announced a planto phase out Â£5 notes featuring social reformer Elizabeth Fry, without plans to put a woman on any other bank notes. After pressure from campaigners the Bank announced it would make Jane Austen the face of the new Â£10 note. Bosses' group head quits amid race row Sexism and the City.

"Mr Zuckerberg's visit to Brussels will be less public than his testimony to Congress last month Facebook has confirmed its chief executive will meet leading members of the European Parliament to discuss privacy concerns in Brussels. The date of the meeting with Mark Zuckerberg has yet to be fixed butthe president of the European Parliament said he hoped it would be next week,external. The talks will be held behind closed doors at a meeting of the Conference of Presidents attended by leaders of the various political groups. A follow-up public hearing is planned. But this later event, which is likely to be in June, will be attended by different Facebook executives. The social network has been embroiled in a data privacy scandal since it emerged that it had not checked that millions of users' personal details had been deleted after being shared with Cambridge Analytica. The London-based political consultancyannounced it would shut earlier this month. The French president is also set to meet Mr Zuckerberg in Paris on 23 May. Mr Zuckerberg previously visited Paris in 2011 when he met President Nicolas Sarkozy Emmanuel Macron's office said the two men would have ""frank"" talks about data privacy and tax. The leaders of Microsoft, Intel and IBM are also set to attend the one-day Tech for Good summit at the Elysee Palace. Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data scandal UK watchdog seeks Cambridge Analytica data Will data scandal firm return from the dead? Mr Zuckerberg will not, however, be visiting the UK. He has refused a request to testify before Westminster's Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, which had complained that an earlier appearance by his chief technology officer had failed to yield enough detail. ""Although Facebook says Mr Zuckerberg has no plans to travel to the UK, we would also be open to taking his evidence by video link, if that would be the only way to do this during the period of our inquiry,"" wrote the committee's chair, Damian Collins MP, in response.,external A spokeswoman for Facebook was unable to say whom else Mr Zuckerberg would meet or where he would travel while in Europe. But she gave the following statement: ""We have accepted the Council of President's proposal to meet with leaders of the European Parliament and appreciate the opportunity for dialogue, to listen to their views and show the steps we are taking to better protect people's privacy."" The arrangements have displeased parliament's Brexit negotiator, who also serves as the leader of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe. ""I will not attend the meeting with Mr Zuckerberg if it's held behind closed doors,"" tweeted Guy Verhofstadt. ""It must be a public hearing - why not a Facebook Live?"" Allow Twitter content?

"Victoria Cilliers almost died in the 2015 parachute jump An Army sergeant accused of trying to murder his wife by tampering with her parachute has told a court he ""would never"" do anything to harm her. Emile Cilliers, 38, of the Royal Army Physical Training Corps, denies sabotaging Victoria Cilliers' parachute in 2015 in a bid to kill her. The prosecution alleges he planned to start a new life with his girlfriend. Mr Cilliers denies two counts of attempted murder and causing a gas leak at the family home in Amesbury. At Winchester Crown Court, defence barrister Elizabeth Marsh QC asked Mr Cilliers whether he had ""harboured any wish to harm"" his wife or children. He replied: ""No. Never. I would never do anything to harm any of them."" Prosecutors allege the defendant was Â£22,000 in debt and believed he was set to receive a Â£120,000 insurance payout in the event of his wife's accidental death. Mrs Cilliers sent a text to her husband on 30 March 2015 saying she could smell gas and had found blood around a gas lever in a kitchen cupboard. The army sergeant told the court he could not remember cutting his hand and had not touched the valve as he ""really doesn't have any experience of gas"". He suggested to the jury that vibrations caused by nearby building work could have opened the valve. Mr Cilliers left work early on the day of the gas leak and on his way home he sent Mrs Cilliers a text message to suggest they go parachuting the following weekend. His wife, an experienced skydiver, survived the 4,000ft (1,220m) fall at Netheravon airfield in Wiltshire in April 2015. Mr Cilliers described how he went on an all-inclusive holiday in the Czech Republic with his girlfriend Stefanie Goller while Mrs Cilliers, then pregnant, was left at home. The prosecution alleges Mr Cilliers sabotaged his wife's main and reserve parachutes, causing them to fail during a jump at the Army Parachute Association at Netheravon, Wiltshire He told the jury he knew he could not afford it, but he ""was being stupid and wasn't thinking properly"". Mr Cilliers said he had not told Ms Goller of his ""completely out of control"" financial problems. Messages between Mr Cilliers and Ms Goller indicated he was considering leaving his job, but he told the court he was merely ""stringing Stefanie along"". As well as having a sexual relationship with his wife and Ms Goller, Mr Cilliers was sleeping with his ex-wife Carly Cillers and had contacted prostitutes. Days after the birth of his second child with his wife, he arranged to go away for the weekend with a former lover called Wanda, although this ""never materialised"". He said he was unhappy in his relationship with Mrs Cilliers, as he thought they may have married ""too soon"". But he said he had planned to stay with his wife until their newborn baby was six weeks old, when he would make a decision. The trial continues.

"This video can not be played Is nationalisation the answer for Britain's railways? Labour wants to bring the railways back under public control - a policy that has garnered widespread support from a travelling public irritated by fare rises, overcrowded trains and a sense that train companies have profited while passengers have not. The only problem is that about three-quarters of the industry - the track, signalling and big stations - are already under public control. They were recaptured not by a reforming Corbynist minister, but by the Blairite transport secretary Stephen Byers. When he withdrew support from Railtrack, the privatised owner of the network, in 2001, it collapsed into administration. From the wreckage was born Network Rail, a not-for-profit organisation whose debts now count as part of public borrowing, and whose budgets and priorities are set in Whitehall. What remains in the private sector are the companies that run the trains - the 25 rail franchises - and the companies that own the trains. When Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell talks about a return to public control, he means the former. John McDonnell says he wants the ""the greatest possible integration"" for the UK's railways Mr McDonnell told the BBC in an interview that if Labour were elected it would bring them back in, then reverse the historic split between track and train created at privatisation. He said he would aim for the ""the greatest possible integration"", claiming it would lead to efficiencies and a better railway. In short, he wants to bring back British Rail. Those with experience of British Rail and the privatised industry are not as gung-ho as Mr McDonnell. Michael Holden, the respected executive who was called in to run the government's Directly Operated Railways when the east coast main line went awry in 2007, said the tyranny of the annual budgets hampered British Rail. ""You were always competing for money with education and health. The end result was that we never had enough money,"" he said. Would going back to a unified British Rail really solve the railways' current problems? The private industry has invested more - there are fleets of new trains, and ridership has doubled since privatisation - but the railway still relies heavily on state support. Even after premium payments from rail franchises are taken into account, the government last year put Â£3.3bn into the industry, down from Â£3.8bn a decade earlier. Most of that went to Network Rail as a direct grant. The cost of improving the railway has also escalated since privatisation. Roger Ford, the technical editor of Modern Railways and a seasoned observer of the industry, said a prime example was the price of electrification - putting in the equipment necessary to run electric rather than diesel trains. The cost of the latest big scheme undertaken by Network Rail - on the Great Western Main Line - had ended up being roughly six times as expensive as the last similar scheme project done by British Rail. Mr Ford said while some cost escalation was to be expected, ""we don't really know why"" current costs were so great. Britain's railways still rely heavily on state support Paul Plummer, chief executive of the Rail Delivery Group, which industry's umbrella body, said nationalisation ""would not help the fundamental issues we face."" Mr McDonnell indicated in an interview with the BBC that a Labour government would be unlikely to try and buy back franchises, offering their owners compensation - the approach he has advocated with a planned renationalisation of water companies - but might instead simply wait for existing franchises to expire.

"This video can not be played Are tumble dryers still a fire risk? New fears have been raised about tumble dryers catching fire, despite efforts to modify the machines. The BBC's Watchdog Live consumer programme has uncovered cases in which the machines have caught fire after being fixed. Some 5.3 million tumble dryers under the Hotpoint, Creda and Indesit brands required modification. Whirlpool, which owns the three brands, said it had total confidence in the fix for the machines. The original defect was discovered in 2015 and has reportedly led to scores of fires since 2004. The company began a huge operation to modify or replace dryers to ensure they are safe. Government introduces new product safety office Truth, fires and tumble dryers: Are our home appliances safe? However, Watchdog spoke to Vicki Mudge and her sister-in-law Jemma Greenslade who said they had to drag Vicki's burning tumble dryer out of their flat. It had earlier been modified. Jemma (left) and Vicki had to drag a burning tumble dryer out of their flat. ""You do trust them to think they are fixing something so it is going to be ok. It is disgusting really,"" Jemma said. They said that, as they lived in a block of flats, the fire could have been a risk to their neighbours. Domestic service engineer Graham Watkinson - who has worked with electrical appliances for over 40 years - believes the modification does not totally remove the risk. Charlie Pugsley, deputy assistant commissioner at the London Fire Brigade, said he was seriously concerned about the reports of modified dryers catching fire. ""There is going to be a time delay between the modification and the fires occurring so if we are starting to see one or two, I would imagine it is only going to get worse,"" he said. ""Each fire has got the potential to do huge damage to someone's home and risk lives."" The damage caused to a seventh floor flat in Shepherd's Bush, London In August 2016, a dryer - awaiting modification - was blamed for a huge fire in a West London tower block, with more than 50 people forced to flee their homes. Despite that incident the company continued to state the machines were safe to use as long as someone was in the property. Which? threatened to bring judicial review proceedings against Trading Standards over the advice being given. Trading Standards instructed Whirlpool to issue new guidance earlier last year that the dryers should be unplugged and not be used until they had been repaired. Andy Slaughter, the MP in the area of the tower block fire, said: ""I am really worried that people now think that the problem is solved - that they can go out, go to sleep and leave machines on - because they have been modified or replaced, but actually there is still a real danger that they could catch fire."" In a statement Whirlpool said: ""We have total confidence in the modification. Extensive testing and analysis of the modification both before and since its implementation has shown it provides an effective solution for the issue. ""An external review with the input from three independent experts in fire safety, product safety, and engineering, concluded that the modification remains the most effective way of rectifying this issue for consumers. ""There have been no reported incidents where the modification has shown to be ineffective. Recent criticisms of the effectiveness of the modification are based on fundamental technical misunderstandings of what it addresses. We are concerned that such misinformed criticism risks discouraging consumers from registering for this important safety modification. ""We continue to urge consumers to contact us immediately if they believe they still own an affected appliance. We can assure consumers that if they contact us now, they can receive a resolution within one week.""

"Theresa May went head-to-head with Jeremy Corbyn in the House of Commons. Here's what happened. The main clash was between the two leaders over Brexit and the current debate going on in the cabinet over which form of customs arrangement the UK wants with the EU after Brexit. The Labour leader went straight in with a joke that Mrs May, amongst others, enjoyed. He asked the PM that when she said she wanted ""as little friction as possible...  was she talking about EU trade or the next cabinet meeting?"" Allow Twitter content?

Mrs May replied that the government had a policy of leaving the customs union and ensuring that in doing so there was as frictionless trade as possible with the EU, no hard Northern Ireland border and also an independent trade policy. Then, referring to friction, she quoted shadow ministers who had backed a second EU referendum and asked Mr Corbyn to ""put minds at rest"" and rule out a second referendum. Mr Corbyn ignored that and said that divisions in the cabinet meant there had been no progress in Brexit negotiations for five months. He said that the PM's trade goal had gone from ""frictionless"" to ""as frictionless as possible"", and asked how much friction she was willing to accept. Mrs May replied that even as a member of the EU trade was not frictionless - presumably explaining why the wording of the goal had changed. The two then clashed over business and the economy with Mr Corbyn listing companies including Airbus who have warned, he said, that uncertainty and the proposed Brexit solutions meant they may be moving jobs out of the UK. Mrs May hit back by attacking Labour's record. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mrs May said that her government had created more jobs and delivered on the Brexit talks so far. She accused Labour of broken promises and said ""it is only the Conservative Party which can be trusted by the British people to deliver a Brexit that is in the interests of British people and to deliver opportunity for all in a Britain fit for the future"".

Here's the BBC's Mark D'Arcy's take on it: This was a marathon PMQs, finally juddering to a halt at 12:52. And Jeremy Corbyn continued hammering away at the government's internal deadlock over the critical question of post-Brexit customs arrangements. It's just an impression, really, but something about the Labour leader's tone and body language suggests that he is edging, more and more, toward a very ""soft Brexit"" policy. Maybe this is the inexorable logic of opposition, pushing Labour towards the policy most likely to damage the government and split the Conservatives. Some on his benches - arch-remainer Stephen Kinnock for one - want to waft him towards their favoured policy of keeping Britain inside the EEA, the European Economic Area. Theresa May, as last week, stuck to her familiar formula about the trade arrangements she seeks, without giving much indication of how the government's open dissention will be resolved. But perhaps she gave a hint that ministers recognise how much trouble they are in, in the Commons. Challenged by Labour's Karen Buck to provide an early vote on the EEA option, she suggested that the vote could come on a number of bills, and then name-checked one that has not yet been fed into Parliament, the promised Implementation and Withdrawal Bill, that will put the divorce deal into UK legislation. What is interesting about that is that the EU Withdrawal Bill, due to clear the Lords today, would provide a much earlier opportunity for an EEA vote. And indeed lots of other awkward votes for the government. Peers have already inserted an EEA requirement into that Bill, and MPs will have to decide to accept or reject it. There is a rumour that ministers are so concerned about a series of possible Commons defeats on this Bill that they might shelve it indefinitely, and maybe put parts of it into that promised Withdrawal and Implementation Bill in the autumnâ¦ at least kicking the can down the road for some months. It underlines the government's continuing problem that there does not appear to be a Commons majority for the PM's version of Brexit. So a combination of Jeremy Corbyn and his pro-EU backbenchers gave the PM an uncomfortable interlude. For the SNP, Ian Blackford opened another Brexit front, by highlighting the opposition to the government's plans in the Scottish Parliament. But that was a predictable line of attack and Theresa May was prepared. Both sides put their line on the record. And the PM also got in a pre-emptive concession on the Grenfell Tower issue - announcing new government funding in advance of the Labour Opposition Day debate this afternoon. A neat piece of choreography with backbencher Bob Blackman, aimed at taking some wind out of Labour's sails this afternoon.

"Oxfam chief executive Mark Goldring is to stand down following the scandal involving claims of sexual misconduct by staff in Haiti, the charity says. Mr Goldring, who was criticised for his handling of the claims that aid workers used prostitutes in 2011, said someone else should ""rebuild"" the charity. He has held the position since 2013 and will leave at the end of the year. In a statement Mr Goldring said: ""This journey will best be led by someone bringing fresh vision and energy."" Oxfam deputy quits over Haiti sex claims How will the Haiti scandal affect Oxfam? Oxfam boss denies Haiti 'cover-up' The British charity was accused of concealing the findings of an inquiry into claims staff sexually exploited female victims of the 2010 earthquake in Haiti. An Oxfam spokeswoman said his resignation was ""absolutely not to do with his handling"" of the crisis. Oxfam chairwoman Caroline Thomson said it was with ""great sadness"" she accepted his resignation, adding that he ""faced the test of a lifetime managing the crisis which hit us in February and related to events before he joined"". Mr Goldring appeared in front of MPs that month, apologising for the actions of staff and also for his own comment to the Guardian that the charity was being attacked as if it had ""murdered babies in their cots"". He denied there had been a cover-up and also said he would not step down unless the charity's board lost faith in his leadership. This video can not be played Mark Goldring: 'We are sorry for the damage done to Haiti and the wider aid efforts' Oxfam's deputy chief executive, Penny Lawrence, resigned in February over the handling of the claims. The allegations,reported in The Times,,externalsaid Oxfam's country director for Haiti, Roland van Hauwermeiren, used the services of prostitutes at a villa rented for him by Oxfam in the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake. According to the paper, Oxfam knew about concerns over the conduct of Mr van Hauwermeiren and another man when they worked in Chad before they were given senior roles in Haiti. The charity's own investigation in 2011 led to four people being sacked and three others resigning, including Mr van Hauwermeiren. It produced a public report, which said ""serious misconduct"" had taken place in Haiti - but did not give details of the allegations. In announcing his resignation, Mr Goldring said: ""Following the very public exposure of Oxfam's past failings, we have redoubled our efforts to ensure that Oxfam is a safe and respectful place for all who have contact with us. ""We are now laying strong foundations for recovery. I am personally totally committed to seeing this phase through. ""However, what is important in 2019 and beyond is that Oxfam rebuilds and renews in a way that is most relevant for the future and so continues to help as many people as possible around the world build better lives.""

"The Russian lawyer who attended the meeting denies working on behalf of the Russian government A Senate panel has released documents on a June 2016 meeting between top Trump campaign aides and a Russian delegation promising political ""dirt"". The 2,500 pages of transcripts include interviews with Donald Trump's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr, who met a Russian lawyer ahead of the 2016 election. The lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, denies working on behalf of Moscow. The meeting is a part of an ongoing probe by the US Department of Justice into alleged Russia meddling in 2016. What are the key things the documents tell us? After the British music publicist who arranged the meeting, Rob Goldstone, suggested he had access to ""official documents and information that would incriminate"" Democrat Hillary Clinton, Mr Trump Jr replied in an email saying ""if it's what you say, I love it, especially later in the summer"". In his Senate interview, Mr Trump Jr called his use of the phrase a ""colloquial term"" to say ""great, thank you"" for ""potential information about an opponent"" - namely, Hillary Clinton. The BBC'sAnthonyZurcher:Mr Trump Jr's ""If it's what you say, I love it"" email was one of the most explosive revelations when news of the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting was first made public. He says he doesn't recall how he felt about being told that Russia and its government wanted to support his father's campaign. He also doesn't go into detail about why he would love it ""especially later in the summer"". Details of the emails and documents hacked from the Democratic National Committee server would first start becoming public, through Wikileaks and similar channels, later in the summer. All you need to know about Trump Russia story Russia-Trump: Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? Donald Trump Jr's June meeting with the Russians has been a key event in the investigation of alleged Russian collusion Donald Trump Jr received a call from a blocked number on 6 June, three days before the meeting. It lasted four minutes and came sandwiched between two phone calls Mr Trump Jr had with Emin Agalarov, an Azerbaijani-Russian businessman and music star who was pushing for the Trump Tower meeting. When asked whether the call might have been his father, who is known to use a blocked number, Mr Trump Jr replied: ""I don't know."" AZ analysis: Mr Trump Jr denies any communications with his father about the meeting before or after it took place. But the day after the blocked call - and two days before the Trump Tower meeting - the elder Mr Trump announces that he would be making a ""major speech"" the following week ""discussing all of the things that have taken place with the Clintons"". That speech never happened. Mr Trump Jr has repeatedly said he did not know of any direct involvement by his father in drafting an explanation for the meeting that subsequently turned out to be untrue. But he did say ""he may have commented through Hope Hicks"", his former spokeswoman. AZ analysis:Trump Jr's memory once again fails him, this time when it comes to exactly how involved his father was in helping craft the original - misleading - explanation that the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting was to discuss adoption policy. That, certainly, was one of the topics - but as Trump Jr's email chain revealed, the presidential son was initially more interested in learning what dirt the Russians might have on Mrs Clinton. Trump Jr doesn't completely close the door on Mr Trump's involvement in the White House damage control operation, however, suggesting that he may have offered edits on the original statement through his long-time communications aide, Hope Hicks. The reason this is relevant is that it could be evidence that the president was engaging in a cover-up to hide the nature of the Trump Tower meeting. Mr Mueller is reportedly reviewing the actions taken as part of his investigation into whether anyone in the White House - including the president himself - took actions that could constitute obstruction of justice. Misleading the public or the media itself is not illegal, but attempts at deception could be evidence of a larger effort to conceal potentially incriminating actions. The June meeting at Trump Tower involved Donald Trump Jr, Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort Mr Manafort, who was the campaign manager at the time of the meeting, took brief notes during the meeting, which included words like ""Offshore - Cyprus"", ""133m shares"" and ""Illici"". AZ analysis:What is ""Illici""? Is it a typo? A super-secret society? Who or what are the ""active sponsors of RNC"" - and does RNC stand for the Republican National Committee? The island nation of Cyprus pops up twice in the list, which is where American-born financier Bill Browder - also named on the list - conducted much of his Russia-related business. Browder, who renounced his US citizenship and currently lives in the UK, was a leading advocate for the Magnitsky Act through which the US Congress imposed sanctions on Russia for human rights violations. Sergie Magnitsky was a Browder accountant who died in a Russian prison under questionable circumstances. Manafort's list is cryptic, and he declined an opportunity to speak to Senate investigators. The former Trump campaign chair is currently under indictment by Robert Mueller on charges of money laundering and unregistered foreign lobbying conducted before he joined the Trump team. Mr Goldstone said his client Emin Agalarov, Azerbaijan's biggest pop star and son of Russian billionaire Aras Agalarov, pressured him into setting up the meeting with Mr Trump Jr - even after Mr Goldstone said it was ""a really bad idea"". ""He said, 'it doesn't matter. You just need to get the meeting.'"" AZ analysis:One of the things that comes through in the committee documents is exactly how eager the Agalarovs were to set up this meeting with the Trump campaign's senior staff. Emin Agalarov exchanged voicemails with Mr Trump Jr. They may have actually spoken (Mr Trump Jr says his memory is fuzzy.) The Agalarovs also pushed Mr Goldstone to make the meeting happen. Did that cause Mr Goldstone to exaggerate what the Russians had to offer Mr Trump Jr as far as information on Hillary Clinton went? Perhaps. On the other hand, it seems like the Agalarovs - and Mr Goldstone - went through an awful lot of work to set up a meeting where Natalya Veslinstkaya and her associates only wanted to talk about adoption policy and sanctions imposed by the Magnitsky Act.

AZ analysis:What is ""Illici""? Is it a typo? A super-secret society? Who or what are the ""active sponsors of RNC"" - and does RNC stand for the Republican National Committee? The island nation of Cyprus pops up twice in the list, which is where American-born financier Bill Browder - also named on the list - conducted much of his Russia-related business. Browder, who renounced his US citizenship and currently lives in the UK, was a leading advocate for the Magnitsky Act through which the US Congress imposed sanctions on Russia for human rights violations. Sergie Magnitsky was a Browder accountant who died in a Russian prison under questionable circumstances. Manafort's list is cryptic, and he declined an opportunity to speak to Senate investigators. The former Trump campaign chair is currently under indictment by Robert Mueller on charges of money laundering and unregistered foreign lobbying conducted before he joined the Trump team. Mr Goldstone said his client Emin Agalarov, Azerbaijan's biggest pop star and son of Russian billionaire Aras Agalarov, pressured him into setting up the meeting with Mr Trump Jr - even after Mr Goldstone said it was ""a really bad idea"". ""He said, 'it doesn't matter. You just need to get the meeting.'"" AZ analysis:One of the things that comes through in the committee documents is exactly how eager the Agalarovs were to set up this meeting with the Trump campaign's senior staff. Emin Agalarov exchanged voicemails with Mr Trump Jr. They may have actually spoken (Mr Trump Jr says his memory is fuzzy.) The Agalarovs also pushed Mr Goldstone to make the meeting happen. Did that cause Mr Goldstone to exaggerate what the Russians had to offer Mr Trump Jr as far as information on Hillary Clinton went? Perhaps. On the other hand, it seems like the Agalarovs - and Mr Goldstone - went through an awful lot of work to set up a meeting where Natalya Veslinstkaya and her associates only wanted to talk about adoption policy and sanctions imposed by the Magnitsky Act.

"Victoria Cilliers almost died in the 2015 parachute jump An Army sergeant accused of trying to murder his wife by tampering with her parachute has told a court he ""would never"" do anything to harm her. Emile Cilliers, 38, of the Royal Army Physical Training Corps, denies sabotaging Victoria Cilliers' parachute in 2015 in a bid to kill her. The prosecution alleges he planned to start a new life with his girlfriend. Mr Cilliers denies two counts of attempted murder and causing a gas leak at the family home in Amesbury. At Winchester Crown Court, defence barrister Elizabeth Marsh QC asked Mr Cilliers whether he had ""harboured any wish to harm"" his wife or children. He replied: ""No. Never. I would never do anything to harm any of them."" Prosecutors allege the defendant was Â£22,000 in debt and believed he was set to receive a Â£120,000 insurance payout in the event of his wife's accidental death. Mrs Cilliers sent a text to her husband on 30 March 2015 saying she could smell gas and had found blood around a gas lever in a kitchen cupboard. The army sergeant told the court he could not remember cutting his hand and had not touched the valve as he ""really doesn't have any experience of gas"". He suggested to the jury that vibrations caused by nearby building work could have opened the valve. Mr Cilliers left work early on the day of the gas leak and on his way home he sent Mrs Cilliers a text message to suggest they go parachuting the following weekend. His wife, an experienced skydiver, survived the 4,000ft (1,220m) fall at Netheravon airfield in Wiltshire in April 2015. Mr Cilliers described how he went on an all-inclusive holiday in the Czech Republic with his girlfriend Stefanie Goller while Mrs Cilliers, then pregnant, was left at home. The prosecution alleges Mr Cilliers sabotaged his wife's main and reserve parachutes, causing them to fail during a jump at the Army Parachute Association at Netheravon, Wiltshire He told the jury he knew he could not afford it, but he ""was being stupid and wasn't thinking properly"". Mr Cilliers said he had not told Ms Goller of his ""completely out of control"" financial problems. Messages between Mr Cilliers and Ms Goller indicated he was considering leaving his job, but he told the court he was merely ""stringing Stefanie along"". As well as having a sexual relationship with his wife and Ms Goller, Mr Cilliers was sleeping with his ex-wife Carly Cillers and had contacted prostitutes. Days after the birth of his second child with his wife, he arranged to go away for the weekend with a former lover called Wanda, although this ""never materialised"". He said he was unhappy in his relationship with Mrs Cilliers, as he thought they may have married ""too soon"". But he said he had planned to stay with his wife until their newborn baby was six weeks old, when he would make a decision. The trial continues.

"Cladding on the Grenfell Tower was blamed for the spread of the fire Survivors of the Grenfell Tower fire will still be living in emergency accommodation 12 months after the tragedy, the government has confirmed. Housing Secretary James Brokenshire told MPs that of the 210 households affected, 201 had accepted offers of temporary or permanent accommodation. Labour said only a third of families affected were in a permanent home. Meanwhile, the government announced it will fund a Â£400m operation to remove dangerous cladding from tower blocks. Only buildings owned by councils and housing associations will qualify. Duke of Cambridge joins DIY SOS Grenfell crew Visual guide to the Grenfell Tower fire Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? Grenfell: Inside the 21st floor Mr Brokenshire told a Labour-led debate that of the 201 households which had accepted offers of temporary or permanent accommodation, 138 have moved into their accommodation. Of these 138, 64 are in temporary accommodation and 74 in permanent homes. Weeks after the fire on 14 June last year, which killed 71 people, the government said survivors would be offered permanent furnished social housing within 12 months. Mr Brokenshire acknowledged that progress had been ""too slow"" and that it was ""understandable"" that some in the community would feel ""let down"" but said the local council now had 300 properties available ""to those who need them"". Shadow housing secretary John Healey said residents had spoken about being offered properties which were damp, with insufficient bedrooms or on tenancy terms which were different to those they had in Grenfell. ""No-one wants to bring up children in a hotel room,"" he said. During the debate, Labour former minister David Lammy paid tribute to family friend Khadija Saye, a 24-year-old artist who died in the fire. ""She died, frankly, because the state failed her,"" he said. ""The state told her to stay put and she stayed put and when she did leave, even though she got split up from her mother, she didn't quite make it out. ""Had she set about leaving earlier, she probably would be with us today."" Conservative backbencher Kwasi Kwarteng said the government will be judged on its response to the tragedy and warned that the Tory party was at risk of losing the good will of victims of the fire. He told the debate that there was an issue of a ""polarised society"". ""The suspicion today is that as the royal borough has got wealthier and wealthier, the political class, the people running the borough have really forgotten some of the less advantaged members of their community,"" he said. Announcing the funding for replacing cladding during Prime Minister's Questions, Theresa May told MPs that fire and rescue services had visited more than 1,250 tower blocks around the country since the fire. Another resident - who suffered from long-term health issues prior to the disaster - was rescued from the fire but died in hospital in January. Cladding on 228 buildings failed safety testsafter the disaster. On Thursday, Dame Judith Hackitt, the senior engineer responsible for reviewing the building regulations in the wake of the Grenfell fire, will publish her final report. ""As we approach the anniversary of the appalling tragedy that was the Grenfell Tower fire, our thoughts are with the victims and survivors and all those affected by that tragedy,"" added Mrs May. The prime minister said that while councils and housing associations ""must remove dangerous cladding quickly"", the new scheme should not undermine other ""important maintenance and repair work"". Privately-owned tower blocks will not be covered by government funding with residents in some buildings covered in the cladding initially being asked to cover the costs. Leaseholder residents in the Citiscape building in Croydon, south London, wereasked to pay up to Â£31,300 eachin order for the cladding to be replaced butthe tower's developer, Barratt Developments, then said it would pay instead.

"Sir Richard Branson and team on East Coast For the third time in just over a decade the government has called a halt to the East Coast Main Line rail franchise. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling says it will be run by his department until 2020 after which it will be in the hands of a public-private partnership. So what led to the decision to ditch the current franchise arrangement? The London to Edinburgh line had been run by a joint venture between Stagecoach, which owns 90% of the franchise, and Virgin, which owns 10% since 2015. The firms agreed to pay Â£3.3bn for the right to run the line, to be paid in instalments over the course of the franchise until 2023. In return for paying those premiums, Stagecoach and Virgin operated trains on the line which runs from London's Kings Cross station, up through Peterborough and passes through York and Newcastle on its way to Edinburgh. Three years into its eight-year franchise, Virgin and Stagecoach made it clear the arrangement was unsustainable: they weren't making enough money. The government says the firms were over-optimistic about an expected increase in passenger numbers when they made their initial bid. The firms themselves and Sir Richard Branson, boss of Virgin in particular, said the two companies had been promised a huge upgrade of the tracks by Network Rail, which would have improved reliability and allowed more services to run, carrying more passengers. Sir Richard said delays to the upgrade had ""torpedoed"" the assumptions behind the original bid. In February Mr Grayling said the franchise would be replaced with an alternative arrangement and began looking at options. On the face of it, the government will lose the remaining Â£2.3bn of the Â£3.3bn promised by the franchise. However, the amount it will lose or gain ultimately will depend on what sort of money the replacement service can generate. The East Coast mainline was government-run until Stagecoach and Virgin's bid Because Stagecoach and Virgin are escaping some of their scheduled payments, critics said halting the franchise early amounted to ""a bail-out"" by the taxpayer of the private sector operators. Both the firms and the government reject that suggestion. Stagecoach and Virgin Trains have lost in the region of Â£200m to keep up their franchise payments. Although the line is profitable, it isn't bringing in enough revenues to cover those commitments. Mr Grayling said Stagecoach and Virgin, as well as the financial losses, had suffered reputational damage. But he added they wouldn't be excluded from bidding to run other parts of the network in future. For two years the line will be state-run, by an operator of last resort, set up and overseen by the department of transport but involving private sector firms including engineering firm Arup. Passengers and staff shouldn't see any disruption to day-to-day services, according to the transport secretary. After 2020 the aim is that there will be much closer cooperation between state-owned Network Rail, which owns the track infrastructure, and whoever is operating the train service. The East Coast Mainline, which is being renamed London and North Eastern Railway (LNER), a brand that has been resurrected from the 1940s, will then be run by a public-private partnership. This is the third franchise on this route to run into trouble. In 2005, GNER signed a Â£1.35bn, 10-year deal in what was then the biggest contract in European railway history. One year later it was stripped of the route. In August 2007, National Express agreed a Â£1.4bn deal, but then handed it back to the government in 2009 against the particularly challenging background of the financial crisis. It was then government-run until Stagecoach and Virgin's Â£3.3bn bid in 2015. What would you like to know about the future of East Coast Mainline rail franchise?

"This video can not be played Why North Korea is angry at this man North Korea has said it may pull out of a summit with US President Donald Trump if the US insists it gives up its nuclear weapons unilaterally. The highly anticipated meeting between Mr Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong-un is due to take place on 12 June. But in an angry statement, North Korea's vice-foreign minister accused the US of making reckless statements and of harbouring sinister intentions. He pointed the finger squarely at US National Security Adviser John Bolton. ""We do not hide our feeling of repugnance towards him,"" Kim Kye-gwan said. The White House has responded by saying it is still hopeful the meeting will go ahead. ""The president is ready if the meeting takes place. If it doesn't, we'll continue the maximum pressure campaign that's been ongoing,"" said spokesperson Sarah Sanders. The groundbreaking agreement for Mr Kim and Mr Trump to meet came about as North Korea said it was committed to denuclearising the Korean peninsula. Exactly what that would entail has remained unclear, but North Korea has invited foreign media to witness the dismantling of its main nuclear test site later this month. What Kim wants Read North Korea's statement in full Mr Bolton recently said North Korea could follow a ""Libya model"" of verifiable denuclearisation, but this alarms Pyongyang, which watched Libya's Colonel Gaddafi give up his nuclear programme only for him to be killed by Western-backed rebels a few years later. The BBC's Laura Bicker in Seoul says North Korea - which had long said its nuclear arsenal is essential for its survival as a state - is now making its demands clear. Laura Bicker, BBC News, Seoul Nuclear weapons have been central to North Korean ideology for its entire history The whole reason it has spent years building up a nuclear arsenal, at such a great cost, is for survival. So to compare denuclearisation in North Korea with Libya or indeed Iraq as John Bolton did on Sunday is not going to offer much comfort.Both regimes collapsed. This is also a warning shot to the Trump administration. They will be aware how much Mr Trump wants this summit and how it is being spun as a success brought about by his maximum pressure strategy. There were signs this boasting irritated Pyongyang, but now it has decided to speak out through someone in a position of power. The release of three Americans from prison was a major concession by North Korea North Korea wants the world to know that it is coming to the negotiating table from a position of strength, and they may feel that they are making all the concessions. They've suspended all missile tests,released the three US detainees, Kim Jong-un met President Moonand the pair signed a declaration, and they're about to dismantle a nuclear test site in front of international media. So to hear the Trump administration claiming credit for a deal they don't like has been a step too far. These statements more than hint that North Korea is prepared to walk away from President Trump's summit in Singapore until it does hear a deal it does like. Mr Kim's statement, carried by state media, said that if the US ""corners us and unilaterally demands we give up nuclear weapons we will no longer have an interest in talks"" and ""will have to reconsider"" attending the 12 June summit in Singapore. He said North Korea did have ""high hopes"" but that it was ""very unfortunate that the US is provoking us ahead of the summit by spitting out ludicrous statements"". North Korea crisis in 300 words Will historic Koreas summit lead to peace? Kim Kye-gwan is known to be highly respected in the North Korean leadership and has taken part in negotiations with the US before. There is very little chance his comments were not personally endorsed by Kim Jong-un. Hours before the announcement, in a sign of growing problems,North Korea had also pulled out of a meeting scheduled with South Korea on Wednesday.because of anger over the start of US-South Korea joint military drills. North Korea had earlier said it would allow them to go ahead, but then called them ""a provocative military ruckus"" which was undermining its diplomatic efforts. This video can not be played Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un: From enemies to frenemies The sudden change in tone from Pyongyang is said to have taken US officials by surprise. Analysts said North Korea could be trying to strengthen its hand before talks. The US state department said it was continuing to plan the Trump-Kim meeting, and Mr Trump is yet to comment. A Chinese government spokesman urged North Korea and the US to ""meet each other halfway"" ahead of negotiations. The hawkish conservative is a firm defender of US power and a confrontational advocate for wielding that strength abroad. He has previously said it would be ""perfectly legitimate"" to carry out a pre-emptive strike on North Korea. In media interviews over the weekend, he said North Korea could follow a Libyan model of nuclear disarmament - Libya gave up its weapons' programmes in the early 2000s and only then secured economic aid and normalised relations with the US. However during the 2011 uprising against Colonel Gaddafi's regime, Western powers intervened in Libya in favour of the rebels, and Gaddafi was captured and killed. North Korea has in the past suggested that Libya may have escaped Western military intervention had it kept its nuclear weapons programme. John Bolton: Bush-era war hawk makes comeback Five things Trump's security chief believes The Muammar Gaddafi story Kim Kye-gwan said in his statement that this was ""not an expression of intention to address the issue through dialogue"". ""It is essentially a manifestation of awfully sinister moves to impose on our dignified state the destiny of Libya or Iraq which had been collapsed due to yielding the whole of their countries to big powers. ""We do not hide our feeling of repugnance towards [Bolton]."" Mr Kim also warns Mr Trump that if he ""follows in the footsteps of his predecessors"" - refusing to engage with North Korea unless it gives up its nuclear weapons - ""he will be recorded as more tragic and unsuccessful president than his predecessors, far from his initial ambition to make unprecedented success"".

Everton,externalalso paid tribute to their former player, saying Wilson was ""unquestionably one of the finest footballers to wear the royal blue jersey"". Former Toffees boss Joe Royle, who made his Everton debut the year Wilson helped them to FA Cup success, said: ""He is a World Cup winner and played in the last England team that had four, maybe five, world-class players. He was certainly one of those. ""He was the best of his kind at the time. And he was a top guy, always there with a smile or a helpful word. I played a few reserve games with Ray and it was like listening to a maestro. He knew his stuff."" Ray Wilson (right) celebrates winning the FA Cup with Everton Wilson's England team-mate Sir Bobby Charlton also paid tribute to his ""close friend"". The 80-year-old said: ""Lady Norma and I are deeply saddened by the awful news that Ray has passed away ""We shared some wonderful memories throughout our career and I had the pleasure of being his room-mate. Ray was a great man and he will be missed by so many people."" Another of Wilson's England team-mates, goalkeeper Gordon Banks, described him as ""a wonderful guy, on and off the field"" and a ""world-class player"". ""It's very, very sad, horrible news,"" Banks said. ""He was always one of the lads who wanted to have a laugh in the dressing room and whenever we went out for a drink. ""He was such a wonderful guy, on and off the field. ""As a player, he really was superb. He wasn't a big, strapping guy, but he was so quick. ""He was a world-class player without any question. There were players we just couldn't do without, they were terrific players, and he was one of them."" This video can not be played The story of the 1966 World Cup Wilson was born in Shirebrook on 17 December 1934, and was given the name Ramon, in tribute to Mexican Hollywood actor Ramon Novarro. He joined Huddersfield at the age of 17 in 1952, having previously worked on the railways. Wilson played in a forward role and in central defence before trying his hand at left-back, where he was advised to remain by reserve-team coach Bill Shankly. It was when Liverpool's legendary manager took charge of the first team in 1956 that the defender's career flourished. Wilson went on to win the first of his 63 England caps in 1960 when he featured in the 1-1 draw against Scotland. He remains the last Terrier to play at a World Cup while at the club, having played at the 1962 tournament. After 283 appearances Wilson joined Everton in 1964. Silverware came in a memorable 1966 when Wilson helped the Toffees beat Sheffield Wednesday 3-2 in the FA Cup final before helping England to World Cup success a few weeks later. The defender played 154 matches for the Merseyside club before joining Oldham in 1969. He finished his career in 1971 at Bradford, a team he also managed for just 10 games. Wilson, who went on to open an undertaker business in Huddersfield, was appointed an MBE in 2000. BBC Sport chief football writer Phil McNulty Ray Wilson may have been one of the more unsung members of England's 1966 World Cup-winning team - but he was a left-back of undoubted world class. Wilson was the consummate defender but also blessed with lightning pace that would have made him a master even in the modern era, when an attacking edge is called for. He made his name at his beloved Huddersfield Town but it was at Everton, who he joined at the relatively late age of 29 in 1964, where he enjoyed his greatest successes. And they all came in the space of two months at Wembley in 1966, playing in the Everton side that came from two goals down to beat Sheffield Wednesday 3-2 in the FA Cup final and then that historic day when West Germany were beaten 4-2 in the World Cup final. Ray Wilson can take his place in history as one of only 11 Englishmen to possess a World Cup winners' medal.

"Lebanon is more tolerant than most Arab countries The organiser of a gay pride week in Lebanon says authorities have forced him to cancel the remaining events. Last year, Lebanon became the first Arab country to hold a gay pride week. But the organiser of this year's Beirut Pride, Hadi Damien, says he was taken to a police station overnight after security services came to an event. Mr Damien says he was asked to sign a pledge that he would cancel what was left of the week - which started on Saturday - in order to be released.

"This video can not be played Rachel Reeves says Carillion directors 'destroyed a British company' Carillion's board presided over a ""rotten corporate culture"" and was culpable for its ""costly collapse"", two committees of MPs have concluded. They also called for a potential break-up of the big four audit firms, after they ""waved through"" the indebted construction firm's accounts. And they attacked the government for lacking ""decisiveness and bravery"" to tackle corporate regulation failures. The MPs said regulators should consider disqualifying the directors. Carillion collapsed under a Â£1.5bn debt pile in January. It employed 43,000 people, about 20,000 of them in the UK, thousands of whom have lost their jobs. It also held numerous public contracts, such as the maintenance of schools and prisons, all of which had to be brought under government control, at a cost to the taxpayer. In a damning 100-page report, the Work and Pensions and the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy committees said: The Big Four accountancy firms were a ""cosy club incapable of providing the degree of independent challenge needed"" Carillion's collapse had exposed ""systemic flaws"" in corporate Britain and showed regulators were ""toothless"" And warned ""Carillion could happen again, and soon"" Rachel Reeves, chair of the business committee, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""The directors are culpable for the mess that Carillion got into and drove the company off a cliff."" She accused them of a ""relentless dash for cash"" by taking on low-margin contracts which didn't make money. ""And when we had the directors in front of our Select Committee, they seemed to be in total denial about what happened to their company,"" she said. In their report, the two committees called Carillion's rise and fall ""a story of recklessness, hubris and greed"". Carillion: Six charts that explain what happened Where did Carillion's problems come from? They singled out former directors Richard Adam, Richard Howson and Philip Green for particular scrutiny, saying the men had grown the firm through ill-judged acquisitions while hiding Carillion's financial problems from shareholders. They added that even as the company publicly began to unravel, the board was ""concerned with increasing and protecting generous executive bonuses"". ""Long term obligations, such as adequately funding Carillion's pension schemes, were treated with contempt,"" they said. Former Carillion chairman Philip Green at a parliamentary hearing They said the directors had presented themselves during parliamentary hearings as victims of ""unforeseeable mishaps"". But Carillion's former finance director, Richard Adam, said he rejected the committees' conclusions and objected to quotes in the MPs' report, which he said had been misattributed to him. Former chairman Philip Green said the board had ""always strived to act in the interests of the company and all its stakeholders"". The two select committees also attacked the big four accounting firms for approving Carillion's accounts despite its spiralling debts. They said Ernst & Young was paid Â£10.8m for ""six months of failed turnaround advice"" Deloitte received Â£10m to be Carillion's internal auditor, but was either ""unable or unwilling"" to identify failings in financial controls, or ""too readily ignored them"" KPMG failed to question Carillion's financial judgements while PwC continues ""to gain"" as its official receiver ""without adequate scrutiny"". Ms Reeves said the competition authorities should consider breaking up the big four accountancy firms to ""help increase competition and deal with conflicts of interest"". Carillion collapse sparks 'big four' probe Carillion pension scheme was 'ignored' But a KPMG spokesman said it had conducted its audits of Carillion ""appropriately"", and Ernst & Young said it was ""disappointed that despite all efforts the business was not rescued"". Deloitte said it was ""disappointed"" with committees' conclusions while PwC said it was helping save ""thousands of jobs"" as official receiver. Carillion delivered ""swathes"" of public services, MPs said Michael Izza, chief executive of the Institute of Chartered Accountants, told the Today programme the report felt like a watershed moment for the industry. ""It gives us an opportunity to think again about what we need to do to fix this. Because if we don't fix this I don't think we're going to have a profession in 20 years time."" The MPs also accused regulators of being too ""passive"" in tackling Carillion's problems, and said government failures had made the collapse of the outsourcing firm ""if not inevitable, then at least a distinct possibility"". They said contractors that handled ""swathes"" of public services needed to be closely monitored But they said the government had failed to spot the risks because of its ""semi-professional part-time"" system of oversight. Frank Field, chair of the Work and Pensions Committee, said: ""Government urgently needs to come to Parliament with radical reforms to our creaking system of corporate accountability."" A Cabinet Office spokeswoman said it had recently announced measures to support government suppliers, including strengthening its commitment to ""protecting staff, businesses and small suppliers from irresponsible directors"". It said it would ""respond fully"" to the committees' report in due course.

"This video can not be played Samantha Markle told Good Morning Britain their father had suffered a heart attack More doubt has been cast on whether Meghan Markle's father will attend his daughter's wedding to Prince Harry on Saturday, as it is reported he is due to have heart surgery. Thomas Markle had told US website TMZ he would not go amid a row overpaparazzi photographs,external; then that he would; then that he could not, due to a planned heart procedure. Kensington Palace declined to comment. Ms Markle's estranged half-sister said he had faced an ""unbelievable stress"". Speaking to Australia's Sunrise morning TV programme from Orlando, Florida, Samantha Markle said she was not sure if Mr Markle would be travelling to Windsor. ""He sent me a message that he was undergoing heart surgery,"" she said. ""We're all hoping he pulls through this now."" Meanwhile, Kensington Palace has announcedPrincess Charlotte will be among the bridesmaidsand her brother Prince George will be a pageboy at the wedding this weekend. Royal wedding: All you need to know Who is Meghan Markle? Princess Charlotte to be bridesmaid Who else could walk Meghan Markle down the aisle? Mr Markle became embroiled in controversy at the weekend, following reports that he staged paparazzi photographs of himself in the run-up to the wedding. The pictures showed Mr Markle - apparently unaware he was being photographed - in a series of wedding-related activities, including being measured for a wedding suit. On Monday, Mr Markle reportedlytold celebrity news website TMZ,externalthat he would not attend the wedding. TMZ later reported,externalthat Mr Markle had and wanted to attend - although he might not be able to because of health concerns. Andin a third report, the website,externalsaid that the health issues and planned surgery would prevent him from attending after all. Meghan's father, Thomas, lives in Mexico On Tuesday evening, BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell said Ms Markle wanted her father to be there, but her major concern would be for his wellbeing. Kensington Palace has said events are ""a deeply personal moment for Ms Markle"". ""She and Prince Harry ask again for understanding and respect to be extended to Mr Markle in this difficult situation,"" the palace said in a statement on Monday. By Jonny Dymond, BBC royal correspondent One minute there's a perfectly scripted wedding about to reach its traditional-yet-modern, royal-yet-diverse climax in the St George's chapel at Windsor.  The next minute there's twists and turns worthy of the finest soap opera. It is difficult to believe that things are quite where the various Palaces involved in this wedding thought they would be at this stage. It is of course conceivable that Thomas Markle could have heart surgery at today, somehow find the energy to make a transatlantic flight, meet the Queen, go to the wedding and walk his daughter down the aisle. But it seems a little unlikely. So who will walk Meghan down the aisle? Who will step under the standards of the Knights of the Garter, over the vault containing the remains of Henry VIII and Charles I and past 600 of years of Royal, English and British history? Will it be Meghan's mother Doria, or will she walk alone? Now, there's a thought. Read more from Jonny Mr Markle had been due to meet Prince Harry for the first time this week,as well as the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, before walking his daughter down the aisle at St George's Chapel in Windsor Castle. Samantha, who has not spoken to her famous sibling in three years - and will not be attending the wedding - told Good Morning Britain the photographs had been done with ""good intention"" and not for money. She previously admitted the pictures had been her idea, in order to portray a positive image. The father of the ex-Suits actress lives in Mexico and is a former lighting director who worked on programmes including the 1980s TV show Married with Children and General Hospital, for which he and his team won two Emmy awards. He and Ms Markle's mother, Doria Ragland, divorced when Ms Markle was six years old. TMZ - which launched in 2005 - stands for Thirty-Mile Zone, an old Hollywood expression that describes the area where the studios are based and where most celebrities happen to live. The US celebrity news site, which scooped the world's media on Thomas Markle's wedding plans, is no stranger to a-list exclusives (albeit not without controversy): Deaths- The showbiz site broke the news of Michael Jackson's death in June 2009 and was the first to report Prince had died in April 2016. But in 2008, TMZ was forced to remove an article wrongly reporting singer Miley Cyrus had died in a car accident and in 2013, it falsely reported rapper Lil Wayne was on his death bed Break-ups- In November 2006, TMZ revealed pop princess Britney Spears was to divorce her then husband Keven Federline and ten years later, broke the news of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie's split Babies- In September 2017, TMZ revealed reality star Kylie Jenner was pregnant and that Travis Scott was the father Mr Markle, who has two children - including Samantha - from his first marriage, filed for bankruptcy two years ago. Ms Markle has previously said: ""It's safe to say I have always been a daddy's girl - he taught me how to fish, to appreciate Busby Berkeley films, write thank-you notes, and spend my weekends in Little Tokyo eating chicken teriyaki with vegetable tempura."" Royal fans are already camped outside Windsor Castle in preparation for the big day The wedding will take place on 19 May at 12:00 BST at St George's Chapel in Windsor. With five days to go, Kensington Palace revealed that Ms Markle will spend her last night before getting married at a luxury Buckinghamshire hotel with her mother, Doria. Prince Harry will be staying 15 miles away at the Dorchester Collection's Coworth Park in Ascot, with his brother, the Duke of Cambridge.

"The Five Star Movement of Luigi Di Maio (L) and Matteo Salvini's League hope to finalise their deal on Wednesday Italy's two populist parties will try to reach a deal on forming a government after a leaked draft revealed plans to defy EU rules on migration and debt. One of the draft ideas is to demand the cancellation of â¬250bn (Â£220bn; $295bn) of Italian bonds bought by the European Central Bank. Italy has the second highest public debt in the eurozone. The two party leaders also launched an attack on EU officials, accusing them of interfering in the talks process. Three EU commissioners have already stressed there is no appetite for any change in the rules. Right-wing League leader Matteo Salvini attacked ""unacceptable interference from the EU"" while Luigi Di Maio, of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, spoke of ""continuous attacks... from Eurocrats"". They also condemned the leak of the draft deal by HuffPost Italia and said the proposals, dated 09:30 on 14 May, were out of date. Why Italy is still searching for a leader Italian economy in charts Mr Di Maio took aim at the UK's Financial Times for a story headlined ""Rome opens its gates to the modern barbarians,external"". The paper warned that Italy was on the verge of forming ""the most unconventional, inexperienced government to rule a western European democracy since the EU's founding Treaty of Rome in 1957"". The parties say much of the 39-page draft has radically changed. But some of the details have not been denied and will alarm the European Union. Five Star and The League want billions of euros of bonds bought up by the ECB as part of its quantitative easing programme to be scrapped. This would lower Italy's public debt, currently at 130% of national output. If a deal is reached, Luigi Di Maio says it will have to be put to an online vote of his party's members They have not confirmed this plan but do say they want to get together with EU partners to rethink the EU's stability and growth pact, which has strict rules on keeping budget deficits below 3% of economic output. The two parties are planning a budget worth tens of billions of euros, with plans for a minimum universal income and a flat tax of 15% for low and middle earners. Italy's populist leaders set to name PM Italy country profile They are still discussing how they want to tighten immigration which they describe in the leaked draft as ""unsustainable for Italy"". These plans could also challenge EU rules. Then there are proposals to scrap EU sanctions on Russia immediately, while confirming Italy's place in Nato. Both populist parties are seen as friendly to President Vladimir Putin. There is still no word on who the parties want to lead the government. Neither Mr Di Maio nor Mr Salvini will take the job of prime minister. By Gillian Hazell, BBC News, Rome Luigi Di Maio and Matteo Salvini have been working day and night to find a common way through their very different policy promises to the Italian electorate. Five Star and The League once sought to leave the EU and return to Italy's old currency, the lira. Now they say they will try and reform the EU from within. Both have strong ideas about how to deal with Italy's ongoing migrant crisis and crushing debt without sticking to EU regulations. Italy is one of the eurozone's founding members and its third-biggest economy but the populist parties want to put Italians first and foremost in their government pact. It is still not clear if, or when, this coalition government might be formed and both parties want to check back with their supporters. Five Star would put the pact to an online vote of its members and The League says it will take the deal to the streets.  If this fails they want to go back to the polls immediately. Three European commissioners have already made clear where they stand on trying to change the rules on debt and migration. ""I don't see any signs that member states would like to change the rules at least any time soon or give exemptions to any member state,"" said Commission Vice-President Jyrki Katainen on Tuesday. Another vice-president, Valdis Dombrovskis, said the Commission still expected Italy to bring down its debt. Immigration Commissioner said he hoped that Italy would not ""change the line on migration policy"".

Now you have the chance to choose with our team selector. Marseille v Atletico Madrid (19:45 BST) Marseille captain Dimitri Payet wants his side to ""write their names"" in the history books by beating Atletico Madrid in tonight's Europa League final. The French side reached their first European final since 2005, when they lost in the Uefa Cup to Valencia. Spaniards Atletico won the competition in 2010 and 2012, and have lost in two Champions League finals since. ""We believe against Atletico because this season has shown that we are a real team,"" said Payet. The former West Ham midfielder set up both goals to inspire his side tovictory over Red Bull Salzburgin the semi-finals, whileAtletico edged past Premier League side Arsenal. Payet added: ""Those who won the Champions League in 1993 are still heroes because nobody else has done it since. We know how tough it is. Of course, that is an added source of motivation, and if we do win the final, our names will be written into the club's history books forever."" Gareth Southgate names England World Cup squad Jonathan Fearby:Those calling for Wilshere need to get a grip - a World Cup Group is three games in 10 days and you need to play five in three weeks to make a quarter-final. When has he ever looked like doing that? Jack Casey:Dier and Henderson the only two central midfielders in the squad. Seen that before and it has never been pretty. Why such an abundance of players in other positions? Surely Wilshere or Shelvey had to go. Etnaâ:Not bringing Lallana, Wilshere or Shelvey to the World Cup is a huge mistake.
Where`s the creative force? Sterling will probably be on the wing. Gareth Southgate names England World Cup squad This man was always going to be included in Gareth Southgate's England World Cup squad and Tottenham striker Harry Kane, who scored 30 Premier League goals for his club this season, is crucial to England's hopes of doing well in Russia.

The 80-year-old said: ""Lady Norma and I are deeply saddened by the awful news that Ray has passed away ""We shared some wonderful memories throughout our career and I had the pleasure of being his room-mate. Ray was a great man and he will be missed by so many people."" Huddersfield saidin a statement,externalthey were ""devastated"" to learn of Ray Wilson's death and added: ""He was a regular supporter at home matchdays alongside his eldest son Russell despite battling Alzheimer's disease."" Everton,externalalso paid tribute to their former player, saying Wilson was ""unquestionably one of the finest footballers to wear the royal blue jersey"". Former Toffees boss Joe Royle, who made his Everton debut the year Wilson helped them to FA Cup success, said: ""He is a World Cup winner and played in the last England team that had four, maybe five, world-class players. He was certainly one of those. ""He was the best of his kind at the time. And he was a top guy, always there with a smile or a helpful word. I played a few reserve games with Ray and it was like listening to a maestro. He knew his stuff."" Ray Wilson, a member of England's World Cup-winning side,has died, aged 83. At 31, the left-back was the oldest player in Sir Alf Ramsey's starting XI which overcame West Germany 4-2 in the 1966 final at Wembley. He spent most of his club career at Huddersfield Town before moving to Everton, where he helped the Toffees win the 1966 FA Cup.

"The reduction in charges follow a period of cuts for the police The number of criminal charges being brought in England and Wales has been falling - despite more crimes being recorded in the same period. BBC analysis of Home Office data for Panorama shows 527,000 charges were brought in 2016-17 - a fall of 65,000 on 2014-15. Meanwhile, the number of crimes recorded rose by nearly 750,000. Police say a squeeze on resources is making crime harder to investigate. The Home Office says it is working with police to find a solution. You need a modern browser to view the interactive content in this page. If the police force lookup does not load clickhere,external. The picture in Northern Ireland and Scotland is different. Charges have fallen at the same rate as recorded crime in Northern Ireland. In Scotland where the criminal justice system is different, they record clear-ups, a broader category than charges  - these have fallen in line with recorded crime. West Yorkshire Police Chief Constable Dee Collins says things are stretched. ""My officers and staff, I think do a fantastic job with the resource that we have, but I realise that we are letting some people down,"" she said. ""Since 2010 we've had a 35% real-term cut and what that has meant in terms of officers and staff numbers is I have 1,400 fewer people."" Fewer charges means victims such as Richard Bolland are not getting justice. Last year he was attacked in the fish and chip shop he runs in Wyke, near Bradford. He was so severely beaten he passed out and says the attack left him looking ""like Frankenstein"". Then he was robbed. ""He took my wallets, the company money, the money to pay the suppliers, the till float, he took everything,"" Mr Bolland said. Richard Bolland was beaten about the head He says the initial response from the police was good, but he feels let down by CID. No-one was ever caught and he was told by the police that if he could come up with a lead to help them, then he should let them know. ""Other than that it was on the shelf. And since then I've not heard a single thing from them."" West Yorkshire Police say that despite receiving tip-offs about who attacked Mr Bolland they could not gather enough evidence to bring them in. They say they have reviewed the case and believe they responded in the right way. ""I think there is an emerging crisis and it's a crisis that's right at the heart of policing, the investigation of crime,"" says Peter Neyroud, a former chief constable. He describes the fall in charges as significant and depressing. Home Office minister Victoria Atkins says the government is looking at this problem ""very carefully"" to see whether there is a problem at force level or if there is something it can do nationally. ""We want to ensure that when a victim reports a crime to the police that it's investigated properly and thoroughly and that any charges that are appropriate are made,"" she said. The number of crimes recorded by police in England and Wales has risen by nearly 750,000 in the last three years. Some of this rise is because police are recording crime better. In early 2014 an investigation by the House of Commons Public Administration Select Committee found that forces had been under-recording crime. As a result data audits are being carried out on each force by the Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary. But some crimes are genuinely up. If you look at the more accurate Crime Survey for England and Wales, offences such as burglary, robbery and some violent crimes are rising. Either way the police have more cases to investigate than they did in 2014. Knife crime rises 22% Reality Check - Is crime up or down? The reduction in charges follow a period of cuts for the police. There are about 20,000 fewer police officers in England and Wales than there were in 2010. ""That's four and a half million policing days of investigation,"" said Mr Neyroud. He says there is also an increased demand for the police service to investigate more rapes, modern slavery, terrorism and organised crime. Forces are having to make tough choices, Dee Collins says ""That's shifting all the experienced resources into those areas and leaving a considerable drop in the expertise in dealing with the basic day-to-day crimes which are the ones that most of the public are concerned about."" He believes this is leading to police screening crimes for those they feel they can investigate successfully and those they can't. In West Yorkshire, Ms Collins admits they are having to make pragmatic decisions about which crimes to follow up. ""For example if it was an elderly victim and something that might feel fairly low-level we will probably still attend. If perhaps it had been myself ringing about a particular issue we might not. "" It has certainly shaken Mr Bolland's faith in the abilities of the police. ""The thin blue line, it's a dotted line now and the dots are getting further and further apart,"" he says. Richard Bolland back in his chip shop Tight resources and rising crime have brought back bad memories for Mr Neyroud from his time in the police. ""We spent more of our time apologising for what we weren't able to do than doing what we were able. ""The police service appears to me to be in that position again.""

Method for calculating change in recorded crime and charges: For charges we have used: 'Outcomes open data year ending March' for 2014-15, 2015-16, 2016-17 taking the data for charges recorded in each particular year. For recorded crime we have used: 'Police recorded crime open data Police Force Area tables from year ending March 2013 onwards' We calculated percentage change using the data for the first and last years in our time period. In the crime categories chart we have removed any category with fewer than 50 charges in the base year of 2014-15. This is consistent with methodology used by the Office for National Statistics.

"Disruption to the body's internal clock may put people at increased risk of mood disorders, scientists say. A clock ticks in nearly every cell of the body. And they change how the tissues work in a daily rhythm. ALancet Psychiatry,externalstudy of 91,000 people found a disrupted body clock was linked with depression, bipolar disorder and other problems. The Glasgow researchers said it was a warning to societies becoming less in tune with these natural rhythms. Although the study did not look at mobile phone use, Prof Daniel Smith, one of the University of Glasgow researchers, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that it was ""likely"" that some of the people in the study who had difficulties might be using social media at night. ""For me absolutely my mobile phone goes off before 22:00 at night and that's it, because obviously we didn't evolve to be looking at screens when we should be sleeping,"" he said. Six tips for a good night's sleep Should I pay more attention to my body clock? What I learned by living without artificial light Should we all become early risers? WATCH: How does a lack of sleep impact your brain? People in the study wore activity monitors for a week to see how disrupted their clocks were. Those who were highly active at night or inactive during the day were classed as being disrupted. And they were between 6% and 10% more likely to have been diagnosed with a mood disorder than people who had a more typical - active in the day, inactive at night - pattern. Prof Smith, a psychiatrist, told the BBC: ""These are not huge differences. ""But what is striking is it is pretty robust across lots of interesting outcomes."" The study found higher rates of major depression, bipolar disorder, more loneliness, lower happiness, worse reaction times and more mood instability in people with body-clock disruption. However, the study cannot tell if the disruption is causing the mental illness or is just a symptom of it. That will take further work. The body clock certainly exerts a powerful effect throughout the body. Mood, hormone levels, body temperature and metabolism all fluctuate in a daily rhythm. Even the risk of a heart attack soars every morning as the body gets the engine running to start a new day. Prof Smith said: ""The study tells us the body clock is really important for mood disorders and should be given greater priority in research and in way we organise societies. ""It wouldn't be too controversial to say we need to reorganise the way we learn and work to be in tune with our natural rhythms."" The study used data from the UK's Biobank research project. However, many of the participants were quite old. Dr Aiden Doherty, from the University of Oxford, said: ""The study population is not ideal to examine the causes of mental health, given that 75% of disorders start before the age of 24 years."" But he added the study showed the way for a similar research in ""adolescents and younger adults to help transform our understanding of the causes and consequences, prevention, and treatment of mental health disorders"".

"Joshua Titcombe died from sepsis nine days after being born at Furness General Hospital Avoidable deaths occurred at a hospital while regulators took too long to act on concerns about midwives, a report has said. Eleven babies and one mother died at Furness General Hospital in Barrow, Cumbria, between 2004 and 2013. AProfessional Standards Authority review said,externalthe Nursing and Midwifery Council failed to react quickly enough to concerns from police and families. The NMC has apologised and admitted its approach was ""unacceptable"". Concerns at the hospital were first raised after the death of nine-day-old Joshua Titcombe in 2008 from sepsis. This prompted a highly critical government-backed report in 2015 which said a ""lethal mix"" of failures led to a number of deaths. The Professional Standards Authority (PSA) Lessons Learned review criticised the NMC for taking up to eight years to begin fitness-to-practise hearings against a number of midwives after concerns were raised. It said the delays meant midwives who were later suspended or struck off continued to practise. ""Further avoidable deaths occurred while the NMC were considering the complaints,"" the report said. ""Its handling of the cases before 2014 generally was frequently incompetent."" Midwives at Furness General Hospital were criticised over the deaths of babies and a mother No prosecutions were brought by police, but three midwives were subsequently struck off and a fourth was suspended following the deaths at the hospital. The review said it could find no evidence of the NMC acting on information it was given by Cumbria Police about 22 cases it had investigated at the hospital, which is part of the University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust. Harry Cayton, chief executive of the PSA, said the review findings ""show that the response of the NMC was inadequate"". Head of midwives' regulator to step down 'Lethal failures' led to baby deaths Midwife admits she is unfit to practise In a joint statement, Liza Brady, Carl Hendrickson and James Titcombe, who were affected by the deaths, said the report showed ""the truly shocking scale of the NMC's failure to respond properly to the serious concerns and detailed information provided to them relating to the safety of midwifery services at Furness General Hospital"". ""We were particularly horrified that even when Cumbria Police directly raised significant issues, the NMC effectively ignored the information for almost two years,"" they added. Mr Hendrickson's wife, Nittaya, and newborn son, Chester, both died at the maternity unit in 2008 after Mrs Hendrickson suffered an amniotic fluid embolism, where amniotic fluid gets into the mother's bloodstream. He told the BBC: ""I was devastated. I needed help, I needed to find out the truth. ""The NMC at no stage offered any help, never contacted me. There was certainly no empathy or compassion. ""They were just a disgrace. They were almost not human."" The organisation declined to respond directly to Mr Hendrickson's criticisms. NMC chief executive Jackie Smith has been in her post for six years Barrow and Furness MP John Woodcock said the report ""shows how local families were systematically obstructed and failed by an organisation whose conduct has brought shame on the proud and vital profession it is supposed to represent"". The review said although the NMC's performance as a regulator is improving, it needs to ""urgently review and improve"" its engagement with patients and families who register complaints and provide them with ""appropriate information"". NMC chief executive Jackie Smith, who has announced she will leave her post in July, said their approach to the deaths ""was unacceptable and I am truly sorry for this"". She said they had made ""significant changes"" since 2014 which had ""put vulnerable witnesses and families affected by failings in care at the heart of our work"". Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the NMC ""clearly still needs a massive culture change so that families feel they are being genuinely listened to and not just made part of a process"".

"Theresa May went head-to-head with Jeremy Corbyn in the House of Commons. Here's what happened. The main clash was between the two leaders over Brexit and the current debate going on in the cabinet over which form of customs arrangement the UK wants with the EU after Brexit. The Labour leader went straight in with a joke that Mrs May, amongst others, enjoyed. He asked the PM that when she said she wanted ""as little friction as possible...  was she talking about EU trade or the next cabinet meeting?"" Allow Twitter content?

Mrs May replied that the government had a policy of leaving the customs union and ensuring that in doing so there was as frictionless trade as possible with the EU, no hard Northern Ireland border and also an independent trade policy. Then, referring to friction, she quoted shadow ministers who had backed a second EU referendum and asked Mr Corbyn to ""put minds at rest"" and rule out a second referendum. Mr Corbyn ignored that and said that divisions in the cabinet meant there had been no progress in Brexit negotiations for five months. He said that the PM's trade goal had gone from ""frictionless"" to ""as frictionless as possible"", and asked how much friction she was willing to accept. Mrs May replied that even as a member of the EU trade was not frictionless - presumably explaining why the wording of the goal had changed. The two then clashed over business and the economy with Mr Corbyn listing companies including Airbus who have warned, he said, that uncertainty and the proposed Brexit solutions meant they may be moving jobs out of the UK.

Mrs May said that her government had created more jobs and delivered on the Brexit talks so far.

Here's the BBC's Mark D'Arcy's take on it: This was a marathon PMQs, finally juddering to a halt at 12:52. And Jeremy Corbyn continued hammering away at the government's internal deadlock over the critical question of post-Brexit customs arrangements. It's just an impression, really, but something about the Labour leader's tone and body language suggests that he is edging, more and more, toward a very ""soft Brexit"" policy. Maybe this is the inexorable logic of opposition, pushing Labour towards the policy most likely to damage the government and split the Conservatives. Some on his benches - arch-remainer Stephen Kinnock for one - want to waft him towards their favoured policy of keeping Britain inside the EEA, the European Economic Area. Theresa May, as last week, stuck to her familiar formula about the trade arrangements she seeks, without giving much indication of how the government's open dissention will be resolved. But perhaps she gave a hint that ministers recognise how much trouble they are in, in the Commons. Challenged by Labour's Karen Buck to provide an early vote on the EEA option, she suggested that the vote could come on a number of bills, and then name-checked one that has not yet been fed into Parliament, the promised Implementation and Withdrawal Bill, that will put the divorce deal into UK legislation. What is interesting about that is that the EU Withdrawal Bill, due to clear the Lords today, would provide a much earlier opportunity for an EEA vote. And indeed lots of other awkward votes for the government. Peers have already inserted an EEA requirement into that Bill, and MPs will have to decide to accept or reject it. There is a rumour that ministers are so concerned about a series of possible Commons defeats on this Bill that they might shelve it indefinitely, and maybe put parts of it into that promised Withdrawal and Implementation Bill in the autumnâ¦ at least kicking the can down the road for some months. It underlines the government's continuing problem that there does not appear to be a Commons majority for the PM's version of Brexit. So a combination of Jeremy Corbyn and his pro-EU backbenchers gave the PM an uncomfortable interlude. For the SNP, Ian Blackford opened another Brexit front, by highlighting the opposition to the government's plans in the Scottish Parliament. But that was a predictable line of attack and Theresa May was prepared. Both sides put their line on the record. And the PM also got in a pre-emptive concession on the Grenfell Tower issue - announcing new government funding in advance of the Labour Opposition Day debate this afternoon. A neat piece of choreography with backbencher Bob Blackman, aimed at taking some wind out of Labour's sails this afternoon.

"Anne Frank's diary, written in hiding from the Nazis, is widely read more than 70 years after her death Two new pages from Anne Frank's diary have been published, containing a handful of dirty jokes and her thoughts on sex. The young Jewish teen's diary, written in hiding from the Nazis,  became world-famous when published after her death and at the end of the war. The hidden pages had been covered with gummed brown paper - apparently to hide her risquÃ© writing from her family. New imaging techniques have finally allowed researchers to read them. The entries were written on 28 September 1942, not long after the 13-year-old Anne went into hiding. ""I'll use this spoiled page to write down 'dirty' jokes"", she wrote on a page with a handful of crossed-out phrases - and jotted down four dirty jokes she knew. She added a few dozen lines about sex education, imagining she has to give ""the talk"" to someone else, and mentioning prostitutes - who she wrote elsewhere that her father had told her about.

""Anne Frank writes about sexuality in a disarming way,"" said Ronald Leopold of the Anne Frank House museum in Amsterdam. ""Like every adolescent she is curious about this subject."" The sentiment was echoed by Frank van Vree, director of the Niod institute, which helped decipher the pages from new photographs taken in 2016. ""Anyone who reads the passages that have now been discovered will be unable to suppress a smile,"" he said. ""The 'dirty' jokes are classics among growing children. They make it clear that Anne, with all her gifts, was above all also an ordinary girl."" The world's most-read diary as a graphic novel 'Anne Frank' costume sparks controversy The Holocaust: Who are the missing million? One of the jokes reads: ""Do you know why the German Wehrmacht girls are in the Netherlands? As mattresses for the soldiers."" The Anne Frank Museum said this was not the only time the teenage girl wrote about sex - mentioning other jokes she had heard the people in her hidden home tell, or the passages about her periods and sexuality. Writing about the decision to publish pages that Anne clearly wanted to keep hidden, the museum said that her diary - a Unesco-registered world heritage document - held significant academic interest. But it also said that the pages ""do not alter our image of Anne"". ""Over the decades Anne has grown to become the worldwide symbol of the Holocaust, and Anne the girl has increasingly faded into the background,"" it said in a statement. ""These - literally - uncovered texts bring the inquisitive and in many respects precocious teenager back into the foreground."" Anne Frank went into hiding in a secret annexe of her father's business on 5 July 1942 - about a month after she received a diary for her 13th birthday. She lived there with her family and their friends, the Van Pels, until their discovery two years later. How they were found after so long in successful hiding remains a mystery. Anne Frank died of disease in a Nazi death camp in 1945, the year the war ended. Her father, the only family member to survive, published her diary in 1947.

"Saturday marks a new chapter in the lives of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle - and the couple are expected to receive new titles ahead of their wedding. Along with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, William and Kate were given the Scottish titles Earl and Countess of Strathearn - seen as a nod to their time at the University of St Andrews - and the Northern Irish titles of Baron and Baroness of Carrickfergus. So, what are Harry and Meghan likely to receive? ""Prince William was given English, Scottish and Irish titles but it is more likely Prince Harry will only get English and Scottish titles,"" says Lucy Hume, associate editor of Debrett's Peerage and Baronetage. ""He is the younger son and not directly in line to the throne. ""There are a limited number of dormant or extinct peerages or titles available and it is most likely Prince Harry will be given the title of 'duke' in England - and it may be as well that he receives a title in Scotland such as 'earl'."" Royal wedding 2018: Meghan's father to have surgery Who else could walk Meghan down the aisle? 'Why I walked myself down the aisle' For Harry and Meghan's main title, the Queen is expected to choose from one of the vacant dukedoms. Vacancies include the dukedoms of Clarence, Connaught, Kendal, Ross, Sussex and Windsor. There are also a number of unoccupied, dormant dukedoms including Cumberland and Albany. Ms Hume continues: ""Factors that might be taken into account include who held the title previously and whether there are any negative connotations, but ultimately it is the Queen's decision based on advice from her staff."" The dukedom of Windsor is one that could be seen to have ""negative connotations"" as it was the title given to Edward VIII after his abdication in 1936. Both bookmakers and royal experts feel the dukedom of Sussex is the most likely option. The dukedom of Clarence is the bookmakers' second favourite. ""The Duke of Sussex was a title that became extinct around 200 years ago,"" says Ms Hume. ""The previous holder of the title didn't have any legitimate heirs and there is no terrible or controversial history associated with the title."" The previous Duke of Sussex lived between 1773 and 1843 The previous Duke of Sussex was Prince Augustus Frederick, the sixth son and ninth child of George III. Like Harry and Meghan, the duke lived in Kensington Palace. He died in 1843, aged 70. Augustus twice married for love but his father did not approve of either match and so did not give his consent to either marriage. As a result, neither of the duke's children were considered legitimate heirs to his title. Any titles given to Harry and Meghan are likely to be little more than that. William and Kate were each given three titles but none of them came with land or powers. Though there are currently six royal dukes in the UK, there are only two royal duchies, or territories associated with a dukedom. Ms Hume says: ""There is the Duchy of Cornwall, which belongs to the Prince of Wales, and the Duchy of Lancaster, which belongs to the Queen. ""Those do have private estates attached to them and the Queen and Prince of Wales derive an income from them but those are the only ones.""

"So you weren't invited. Don't despair. Royal weddings are a global phenomenon. And hundreds of millions of people are expected to witness Prince Harry marry Meghan Markle in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle, whether on television or online, or by listening to proceedings on the radio. The streets of Windsor, Berkshire, will also be lined with thousands of well-wishers hoping to catch a glimpse of the happy couple in person. So whether you're watching from your sofa, a community street party or a far-flung location, here's how to ensure the perfect view. Royal wedding: All you need to know Remember the previous royal weddings Nice day for a royal white wedding? A non-Brits guide to the royal wedding All the main UK broadcasters are devoting much of Saturday to the occasion. While the ceremony doesn't begin until 12:00 BST, there will be several hours of commentary beforehand - and that's even before the guests start to arrive. Special programmes begin onBBC Oneand the BBC News Channel and onSky,external(on Sky News and Sky One), starting at 09:00 BST.  The full coverage onITV,externalkicks off at 09:25. The coverage will be streamed live on theBBC News websiteor onBBC iPlayer. It is worth noting that cameras inside the chapel will provide the same pictures to all the networks, so once the ceremony starts, the footage will be identical across the channels, although they will keep their separate commentaries. The BBC haswaived the TV licence fee, meaning street parties and other special eventscan screen the wedding livewithout buying a licence. The wedding will also be covered on the BBC NewsFacebook page,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,externalaccounts throughout the day. On radio, Claire Balding will host live commentary from Windsor Castle onBBC Radio 4from 11:30 BST andRadio 5 livefrom 10:00 BST. Outside the UK, BBC America, BBC Canada and BBC World News will be broadcasting coverage. Or you can tune in on BBC World Service radio. In Windsor, viewing areas will be created along the procession route. There will be live entertainment in the town centre, which will be decorated with bunting and banners. Big screens showing live footage of the wedding will be shown on the Long Walk and in Alexandra Gardens in Windsor. At 13:00 BST, the newlyweds will travel through the town in the Ascot Landau carriage, which is used in official and ceremonial state events. The carriage will leave Castle Hill, travel through Windsor and then proceed up the Long Walk, all the way back to St George's Hall by Windsor Castle. Rail bosses advise that trains will be ""extremely busy"". Queuing systems will be introduced at several stations - most likely London Waterloo, Slough, Staines and the two stations in Windsor - to avoid overcrowding on platforms. Services between Windsor and Slough will run every 20 minutes, with trains increased from two carriages to four - the maximum that can operate on the local line. South Western Railway will double its direct Windsor services from London Waterloo to four per hour and use 10-carriage trains. Make sure you get there early, though - Thames Valley Police may order trains not to stop at Windsor if visitor numbers become a safety issue, and the wedding route could be closed off to latecomers. Passengers are also being asked to keep baggage to a minimum as security checks on excess luggage could delay journeys. People planning to travel by car are being warned by the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead tobook parking in advance,,externalas spaces are limited. Motorists should also be aware ofroad closures,externalalong the procession route which started at 22:00 BST on Friday.

"Commons begins with international trade questions Forthcoming parliamentary business announced Statement on gambling machines Statement on building safety regulations after Grenfell review Backbench business debate on plastic bottles and coffee cups Debate on International Day against homophobia, transphobia and biphobia Grenfell report author Dame Judith Hackitt questioned by MPs Esther Webber, Richard Morris and Robbie Hawkins House of CommonsParliament That's it for our live text coverage of Parliament today. The day started with trade questions before Sports Minister Tracey Crouch came to the House to update MPs on the government's decision to lower stakes on fixed-odds betting terminals. Then Housing Secretary James Brokenshire made a statement on Dame Judith Hackitt's review of building safety in the wake of the Grenfell Tower fire, announcing that he would launch a consultation on banning flammable cladding even though Dame Judith did not make that recommendation. Labour urged him to go even further, with frontbencher John Healey saying: ""Don't consult on it - do it."" There were backbench business debates this afternoon on plastics and on tackling homophobia, biphobia and transphobia. The Commons will return on Monday. The government announces a consultation on a ban, despite a review not recommending such a move. Housing, Communities and Local Government Committee Select CommitteeParliament Dame Judith says the country needs to ""get on the front foot"" in terms of building regulations and fire safety, and needs a system in place capable of flagging up concerns before they occur rather than responding to another tragedy like Grenfell. We'll be leaving our coverage there, with Dame Judith likely to be called again by the Housing, Communities and Local Government after they have fully considered her final report. Housing, Communities and Local Government Committee Select CommitteeParliament Asked why the report does not call for a ban of dangerous materialsas well asimproved systems for enforcing regulations, Dame Judith says it is because she hoped this would mean any issues that get past any banning would still be picked up. ""Making progress on this does not have to wait for regulation,"" she insists. International day against homophobia debate House of CommonsParliament Equalities Minister Victoria Atkins says ""it's worth reflecting on how far we have come"" since the decriminalisation of homosexuality. The UK is a ""world leader"" on LGBT rights but we should not be complacent, she argues. She tells the House the response to the government's national LGBT survey was ""unprecedented"" and it will be published in the next few weeks. On the Gender Recognition Act, she says many trans people are ""clear the process is not working for them"" and ""we are expecting to launch the consultation before the summer recess"". Housing, Communities and Local Government Committee Dame Judith says the whole system for testing products such as cladding ""has flaws"" and that the tests ""do not reflect real life duties"". It is ""for the people who design the test to address"", she says. ""Unless we all recognise that there are many flaws in many parts of this system and we need to fix them all, then we aren't going to change things. ""I'm sorry but simply fixing cladding is not the only solution that we need to this problem."" International development questions House of CommonsParliament Shadow equalities minister Dawn Butler urges the government to launch its promised consultation on amending the Gender Recognition Act and stop ""kicking the can down the road"". She claims the delay is creating a ""hostile environment"" for trans people in the UK. She also calls on the government to publish the results of its national LGBT survey so ""we can work together to move things forward"". International day against homophobia debate House of CommonsParliament The SNP's Hannah Bardell says comments across the chamber this afternoon demonstrate why we still need dedicated awareness-raising days. She tells MPs that many LGBT young people suffer mental health problems ""as a result of being discriminated against"" and trans teenagers are at a higher risk of self-harming. She recalls that the introduction of same-sex marriage ""helped me move forward"" and goes on to say that ""coming out has helped me tackle my anxiety"". Housing, Communities and Local Government Committee Select CommitteeParliament Dame Judith defends herself from a suggestion by Conservative Kevin Hollinrake that she has ""jumped to a conclusion"" about building regulations, rather than examining the specifics. She says that her conclusion that the regulations themselves are not the issue, but that they do not reach intended outcomes because of enforcement, is based on evidence that she has taken as part of the review. The review was not intended to examine just the regulations, but the whole regulatory system, she says. Lords tweets Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Housing, Communities and Local Government Committee Select CommitteeParliament Defending her decision not to call for a ban of flammable cladding in her report, Dame Judith says her role in carrying out the review was to look at the system as a whole. ""I'm pleased to see that the secretary of state has announced he's going to consult on whether combustible materials should be banned,"" she says. ""I think that is complementary to this review, I think it's the right thing to do, but on its own it will be insufficient... simply banning something is no guarantee of compliance. ""It is not the regulations themselves that are the principle problem, but the way in which those regulations are applied and the lack of proper enforcement."" House of CommonsParliament Conservative Bob Stewart stands up to say he voted against same-sex marriage and now realises he was wrong to do so, having seen the ""joy"" it brings to people. He adds that he now believes that the Church of England should make changes so it can marry gay couples. International day against homophobia debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative MP Justine Greening speaks briefly about her own experience of coming out. ""I needed to be part of the solution,"" she says. ""I realised I could be a step on the road to give other people confidence to be clear about who they are...I felt it was important."" She concludes: ""You can't be at your best if you can't be yourself."" Housing, Communities and Local Government Committee Select CommitteeParliament In an opening statement to the committee, Dame Judith says her final report following review is ""about making what should already be happening happen"". She acknowledges the report ""will not be sufficient"" in dealing with some concerns, such as cladding, arguing that these issues can and should be addressed in parallel with the framework her report suggests. The voice of residents, including those formerly of Grenfell Tower, has been vital in her review, she adds, and says any new system needs to include residents' views and keep them informed. Housing, Communities and Local Government Committee Select CommitteeParliament The Housing, Communities and Local Government Committee session with Dame Judith Hackitt has began, with chair Clive Betts expressing ""disappointment"" that members were not given access to an embargoed copy of the report beforehand, meaning they have been unable to read it before the session. The committee is hearing from Dame Judith after the release of the Independent Review of Building Regulations and Fire Safety final report. The report has surprised some bynot recommendinga ban on flammable cladding, although the government has said today it will open a consultation on whether a ban should be introduced. International day against homophobia debate House of CommonsParliament Labour's Peter Kyle opens a debate marking the international day against homophobia, transphobia and biphobia, stressing than when it comes to this type of discrimination ""you don't stand by quietly"". He observes that while advances towards equality have been ""profound"", ""we have not reached the destination"". He says he's never experienced homophobia in Parliament and he hopes the time will come when the same is true for trans people in the workplace.

Plastics debate House of CommonsParliament Environment Minister George Eustice draws attention to the government's ambition to be the ""first generation to leave a natural environment in a better state than we found it"". He says there's been a ""huge rise in public consciousness"" about this matter, and pays tribute to the BBC documentary Blue Planet. He tells MPs the government wants to improve the rate of recycling, reduce the number of plastics in use, and make recycling easier to understand. He also highlights plans to ban plastic straws and cotton buds, and to consider a levy on disposable cups. Â© 2025 BBC.

"North Korea's belligerent threat to call off landmark talks with the US - currently slated for 12 June in Singapore - is a remarkable turnaround. Just last month, the world watched on as North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un planted peace trees and held hands with South Korean President Moon Jae-in. At the time,Mr Kim pledged a ""new history"" in relations with his neighbourand said it was the ""starting point"" for peace between the two Koreas. Mr Kim has also said, ahead of the upcoming Singapore meeting, that North Korea would halt nuclear and missile tests immediately. (The US wants Pyongyang to give up its weapons programme completely and irreversibly.) Now though, that may not happen. But frankly, given the unpredictable nature of the North and its leader, this latest development can hardly be labelled a surprise. As I've written before, the Singapore meeting is very much a business one for Washington and Pyongyang - and so the North is now simply laying out the terms of the deal it wants, well ahead of any meeting taking place. North Korea's economy partly relies on foreign trade Kim Jong-un hasn't been shy about his focus on the North's economy.  He's repeatedly said he is committed to the so-called dual strategy of Byungjin -developing both nuclear weapons and the economy simultaneously. In April of this year though, about five years after announcing his Byungjin policy,Kim Jong-un said the North had achieved what it needed to on the nuclear front,external, and could now shift its concentration to the economy. Which is why it was no surprise the US has said that any private investment in North Koreais contingent on the country's commitment to full denuclearisation. N Korea threatens to cancel Trump summit Economic pain pushes N Korea to talks Did sanctions push N Korea into US talks? North Korea frees US detainees Focusing on the economy is something Pyongyang is under pressure to do. The implementation of UN and US sanctions have started to hurt North Korea's economy. So too have moves by the US to force other countries, including China, to cut trade with the pariah state. As I wrote earlier this year,data shows that North Korea's economy has been taking a hit from sanctions. North Korean exports may have declined by 30% in 2017. In particular, exports to China, North Korea's biggest trading partner, are down as much as 35%. That's wiped out a big chunk of the regime's revenue stream. The regime's elite, who Kim Jong-un needs to keep on his side, won't like that. But what's more unnerving for Pyongyang is that things could get much worse. The key issue expected to be discussed in Singapore is North Korea's nuclear weapons programme Still, the North isn't going to give up something for nothing. ""North Korea and the US have substantively different understandings of what denuclearisation means,"" The Diplomat's Ankit Panda told me. What the North really wants, is sanctions relief, he said. ""Currently there are around nine different sanctions resolutions that the North is under,"" Mr Panda added. ""This makes sanctions relief impossible. Even though South Korea may be positively disposed towards the North, nothing can happen without the UN and the US."" Nine charts which tell you all you need to know about North Korea US may allow private investment in N Korea What was Kim Jong-un's most used word? Which is why these latest comments from the North should be seen as diplomatic brinkmanship - or a test of the US' willingness to offer concessions, as William Newcomb, a former member of the UN Panel of Experts told me. But whether this strategy will work is questionable and many analysts say the prospect of a down payment in the form of an easing of sanctions to ensure the Singapore talks go ahead, would be surprising. ""The UN Security Council would have to act to remove, modify or suspend international sanctions,"" says Mr Newcomb. ""In my opinion, it would take considerable progress towards denuclearisation to obtain international consent for sanctions relief sufficient to make any difference. US leadership would be indispensable."" Which may be why Pyongyang is playing this game. It wants to make sure that the US knows how much is at stake and to ensure it has the leverage to get what it's really after - guarantees that its economy can survive.

"A meeting between Donald Trump (left) and Kim Jong-un has been much anticipated North Korean Deputy Foreign Minister Kim Kye-gwan has warned his country could pull out of a summit with US President Donald Trump, accusing Washington of harbouring sinister intentions. Here is his statement in full: Kim Jong-un, chairman of the State Affairs Commission of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea [DPKR], made a strategic decision to put an end to the unpleasant history of the DPRK-US relations and met [Mike] Pompeo, US secretary of state, for two times during his visit to our country and took very important and broad-minded steps for peace and stability in the Korean peninsula and the world. In response to the noble intention of Chairman Kim Jong-un, President Trump stated his position for terminating the historically deep-rooted hostility and improving the relations between the DPRK and the US. I appreciated the position positively with an expectation that the upcoming DPRK-US summit would be a big step forward for catalysing detente on the Korean peninsula and building a great future. North Korea crisis in 300 words N Korea threatens to cancel Trump summit But now prior to the DPRK-US summit, unbridled remarks provoking the other side of dialogue are recklessly made in the US and I am totally disappointed as these constitute extremely unjust behaviour. High-ranking officials of the White House and the Department of State including John Bolton, White House national security adviser, are letting loose the assertions of a so-called Libya mode of nuclear abandonment: ""complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation"", ""total decommissioning of nuclear weapons, missiles, biochemical weapons"" etc, while talking about a formula of ""abandoning nuclear weapons first, compensating afterwards"". This is not an expression of intention to address the issue through dialogue. It is essentially a manifestation of an awfully sinister move to impose on our dignified state the destiny of Libya or Iraq, which had been brought down due to yielding the whole of their countries to big powers. I cannot suppress indignation at such moves of the US, and harbour doubt about the US sincerity for improved DPRK-US relations through sound dialogue and negotiations. John Bolton: Bush-era war hawk makes comeback Will historic Koreas summit lead to peace? The world knows too well that our country is neither Libya nor Iraq which have met miserable fates. It is absolutely absurd to dare compare the DPRK, a nuclear weapon state, to Libya which had been at the initial stage of nuclear development. We shed light on the quality of Bolton already in the past, and we do not hide our feeling of repugnance towards him. If the Trump administration fails to recall the lessons learned from the past when the DPRK-US talks had to undergo twists and setbacks owing to the likes of Bolton, and turns its ear to the advice of quasi-""patriots"" who insist on a Libya mode and the like, the prospects of the forthcoming DPRK-US summit and overall DPRK-US relations will be crystal clear. This video can not be played Why North Korea is angry at this man We have already stated our intention for denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula and made clear on several occasions that precondition for denuclearisation is to put an end to the anti-DPRK hostile policy and nuclear threats and blackmail of the United States. But now, the US is miscalculating the magnanimity and broad-minded initiatives of the DPRK as signs of weakness and trying to embellish and advertise as if these are the product of its sanctions and pressure. The US is trumpeting as if it would offer economic compensation and benefit in case we abandon nukes. But we have never had any expectation of US support in carrying out our economic construction and will not at all make such a deal in future, too. It is a ridiculous comedy to see that the Trump administration, claiming to take a different road from the previous administrations, still clings to the outdated policy on the DPRK - a policy pursued by previous administrations at the time when the DPRK was at the stage of nuclear development. If President Trump follows in the footsteps of his predecessors, he will be recorded as a more tragic and unsuccessful president than his predecessors, far from his initial ambition to make unprecedented success. If the Trump administration takes an approach to the DPRK-US summit with sincerity for improved DPRK-US relations, it will receive a deserved response from us. However, if the US is trying to drive us into a corner to force our unilateral nuclear abandonment, we will no longer be interested in such dialogue and cannot but reconsider our proceeding to the DPRK-US summit. This statement was released via the state-run North Korean news agency KCNA's website. N Korea threatens to cancel Trump summit Why is North Korea angry at this man?

"This video can not be played Chris Grayling says talk of nationalising the whole rail network was ""missing the point"" Rail services on the East Coast Main Line are being brought back under government control, following the failure of the current franchise. Operators Stagecoach and Virgin Trains will hand over control from 24 June. The Department for Transport will run the service until a new public-private partnership can be appointed in 2020. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said it would smooth the transition to a new operator, but critics said it was evidence of private sector failure. Mr Grayling said the franchise had failed because Stagecoach and Virgin Trains had ""got their bid wrong"", overestimating the profitability of the line. It is the third time in a just over a decade that the government has called a halt to the East Coast franchise. Why East Coast Mainline has hit the buffers Should the UK renationalise the railways? Rail firm changes time of every train The London to Edinburgh line has been run by a joint venture between Stagecoach and Virgin, since 2015. The companies promised to pay Â£3.3bn to run the franchise until 2023, but at the end of last year it become clear they were running into trouble. In February it was announced that the franchise would end early, leading to accusations the government was bailing them out. This is the third time a franchise on the East Coast Main Line has failed. In 2005, GNER signed a Â£1.35bn, 10-year deal in what was then the biggest contract in European railway history. One year later it was stripped of the route. In August 2007, National Express agreed a Â£1.4bn deal, but then handed it back to the government in 2009 amid the financial crisis. It was then government-run until Stagecoach and Virgin's Â£3.3bn bid in 2015. Read more:What went wrong at the East Coast Main Line? Analysis: By Theo Leggett, business correspondent To have one rail company fail to fulfil its contract may be regarded as a misfortune. To lose three looks like carelessness. The government insists that the East Coast service is not failing, and will continue to generate revenue for the public purse. It says Stagecoach and Virgin have only themselves to blame for their inability to make enough money from the line. That may be true. But critics say that if operators keep over-bidding, then that suggests a problem with the tender process. The assumptions made by the DfT when inviting bids have also been widely questioned. Now the DfT wants to use the line as a model for a new type of franchise, based on a public-private partnership. That may help to solve some issues - for example, reducing the friction between the track operator, Network Rail and the train operator. But whether it will help to make the line viable for the new operator is open to question. Mr Grayling said the companies had overestimated growth in passenger numbers and revenues and were having to reach into their own pockets to fulfil the terms of the franchise. He told the Commons that Stagecoach and Virgin have lost almost Â£200m, but there had not been a loss to taxpayers ""at this time"". The rail companies have blamed their problems on Network Rail, saying it had failed to upgrade the line which would have allowed them to run more frequent services. Shadow Chancellor, John McDonnell tweeted that he welcomed the move, which he said was implementing Labour's Manifesto promise to renationalise the railways. Allow Twitter content?

For the next two years the operator of last resort, overseen by the Department of Transport will operate the East Coast Main Line. It will be advised by the engineering firm Arup. In 2020 there will be another tender process for operating the franchise. Mr Grayling would like to see closer co-operation between the state-owned Network Rail which owns the track infrastructure and the private train operators. Despite their failure on the East Coast Main Line, Virgin and Stagecoach will be allowed to bid for future rail franchises. Analysis: By Norman Smith, assistant political editor For a government wedded to the benefits of the private sector and to leaving the railways in the hands of private companies, today's decision is a significant blow. It's also further ammunition for a Corbyn Labour Party committed to renationalising the railways. Mr Grayling may protest that this is only a temporary measure - but it is still the third time in just over a decade that a private company has had to be stripped of the East Coast Main Line contract. There are also likely to be raised eyebrows that despite their failure, Virgin Stagecoach will still be able to bid to run the line again after it is transferred back into public private ownership in 2020. And while memories of British Rail's stale sandwiches may have faded - strikes, costly commuter fares, cramped carriages and failing companies are hardly likely to endear passengers to the current crop of private rail operators. After looking into problems with the service, Mr Grayling said he was advised ""that there is no suggestion of either malpractice or malicious intent in what has happened"". He added that the firms have paid a ""high financial and reputational price"" in relation to the East Coast route. Stagecoach said it had attempted to negotiate a new contract with the Department for Transport, without success. Mr Grayling said passengers and staff would not be affected by the change to the franchise arrangement. He said season tickets, timetables and employment conditions would remain unchanged.

"The manual was issued to journalists, coaches and officials heading to the World Cup in Russia The Argentine Football Association (AFA) has been panned for including a chapter about ""how to stand a chance with a Russian girl"" in a manual it handed to journalists travelling to the World Cup in Russia. It recommended that journalists ""look clean, smell nice and dress well"" in order to impress Russian ""girls"". It also urged them to treat women as ""someone of worth"". The advice caused an outcry on social media and the AFA has since removed it. The association apologised and said that an internal investigation had found that part of the material was ""printed by mistake"". The controversy comes just months after the Argentine capital, Buenos Aires, saw the biggest women's march in Latin America with protesters decrying rampant sexism and demanding an end to violence against women. Argentine journalist Nacho Catullo said he was among the dozens of reporters and football officials attending a free course on Russian language and culture held by the AFA for those travelling to the World Cup in Russia. Brazil's female sports reporters call time on sexual harassment Ukraine women's football clip prompts online sexism row Belgium drops rapper's World Cup song after sexism row On his Twitter account he described (in Spanish) how they were handed a manual in which the chapter on ""how to stand a chance with a Russian girl"" featured. He tweeted photos of the chapter which started being shared and mocked on the internet as the course was still going on. According to Catullo, officials then interrupted the course, collecting the manuals only to return them with the controversial pages torn out. Allow Twitter content?

The advice is divided into eight sections and goes straight to the point. ""Because Russian women are beautiful, many men just want to sleep with them,"" it suggests high up. ""Maybe they want that too, but they are also persons who want to feel important and unique. ""Don't ask stupid questions about sex. For Russians, sex is something very private and not discussed in public."" It also urges Argentine men to start preparing early: ""Russian women like men who take the initiative, if you're not self-confident then you need to start practicing talking to women."" To those Argentine men still doubting themselves it offers encouragement: ""Remember that many [Russian women] don't know much about your country, you're new and different, this is your advantage over Russian men."" Finally, it urges men to be choosey and to concentrate on those Russian women with whom they may stand a chance. ""Normally, Russian women care about the important things but of course you'll also find those who just care about material things, money or whether you're handsome, you name it. But don't worry, there are many beautiful women in Russia and not all are for you. Be selective!"" Sources in the AFA told local media that the controversial chapter had been lifted from a blog on the internet. It is not yet clear who decided to include it in the manual.

"This video can not be played Rachel Reeves says Carillion directors 'destroyed a British company' Carillion's board presided over a ""rotten corporate culture"" and was culpable for its ""costly collapse"", two committees of MPs have concluded. They also called for a potential break-up of the big four audit firms, after they ""waved through"" the indebted construction firm's accounts. And they attacked the government for lacking ""decisiveness and bravery"" to tackle corporate regulation failures. The MPs said regulators should consider disqualifying the directors. Carillion collapsed under a Â£1.5bn debt pile in January. It employed 43,000 people, about 20,000 of them in the UK, thousands of whom have lost their jobs. It also held numerous public contracts, such as the maintenance of schools and prisons, all of which had to be brought under government control, at a cost to the taxpayer. In a damning 100-page report, the Work and Pensions and the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy committees said: The Big Four accountancy firms were a ""cosy club incapable of providing the degree of independent challenge needed"" Carillion's collapse had exposed ""systemic flaws"" in corporate Britain and showed regulators were ""toothless"" And warned ""Carillion could happen again, and soon"" Rachel Reeves, chair of the business committee, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""The directors are culpable for the mess that Carillion got into and drove the company off a cliff."" She accused them of a ""relentless dash for cash"" by taking on low-margin contracts which didn't make money. ""And when we had the directors in front of our Select Committee, they seemed to be in total denial about what happened to their company,"" she said. In their report, the two committees called Carillion's rise and fall ""a story of recklessness, hubris and greed"". Carillion: Six charts that explain what happened Where did Carillion's problems come from? They singled out former directors Richard Adam, Richard Howson and Philip Green for particular scrutiny, saying the men had grown the firm through ill-judged acquisitions while hiding Carillion's financial problems from shareholders. They added that even as the company publicly began to unravel, the board was ""concerned with increasing and protecting generous executive bonuses"". ""Long term obligations, such as adequately funding Carillion's pension schemes, were treated with contempt,"" they said. Former Carillion chairman Philip Green at a parliamentary hearing They said the directors had presented themselves during parliamentary hearings as victims of ""unforeseeable mishaps"". But Carillion's former finance director, Richard Adam, said he rejected the committees' conclusions and objected to quotes in the MPs' report, which he said had been misattributed to him. Former chairman Philip Green said the board had ""always strived to act in the interests of the company and all its stakeholders"". The two select committees also attacked the big four accounting firms for approving Carillion's accounts despite its spiralling debts. They said Ernst & Young was paid Â£10.8m for ""six months of failed turnaround advice"" Deloitte received Â£10m to be Carillion's internal auditor, but was either ""unable or unwilling"" to identify failings in financial controls, or ""too readily ignored them"" KPMG failed to question Carillion's financial judgements while PwC continues ""to gain"" as its official receiver ""without adequate scrutiny"". Ms Reeves said the competition authorities should consider breaking up the big four accountancy firms to ""help increase competition and deal with conflicts of interest"". Carillion collapse sparks 'big four' probe Carillion pension scheme was 'ignored' But a KPMG spokesman said it had conducted its audits of Carillion ""appropriately"", and Ernst & Young said it was ""disappointed that despite all efforts the business was not rescued"". Deloitte said it was ""disappointed"" with committees' conclusions while PwC said it was helping save ""thousands of jobs"" as official receiver. Carillion delivered ""swathes"" of public services, MPs said Michael Izza, chief executive of the Institute of Chartered Accountants, told the Today programme the report felt like a watershed moment for the industry. ""It gives us an opportunity to think again about what we need to do to fix this. Because if we don't fix this I don't think we're going to have a profession in 20 years time."" The MPs also accused regulators of being too ""passive"" in tackling Carillion's problems, and said government failures had made the collapse of the outsourcing firm ""if not inevitable, then at least a distinct possibility"". They said contractors that handled ""swathes"" of public services needed to be closely monitored But they said the government had failed to spot the risks because of its ""semi-professional part-time"" system of oversight. Frank Field, chair of the Work and Pensions Committee, said: ""Government urgently needs to come to Parliament with radical reforms to our creaking system of corporate accountability."" A Cabinet Office spokeswoman said it had recently announced measures to support government suppliers, including strengthening its commitment to ""protecting staff, businesses and small suppliers from irresponsible directors"". It said it would ""respond fully"" to the committees' report in due course.

"The reduction in charges follow a period of cuts for the police The number of criminal charges being brought in England and Wales has been falling - despite more crimes being recorded in the same period. BBC analysis of Home Office data for Panorama shows 527,000 charges were brought in 2016-17 - a fall of 65,000 on 2014-15. Meanwhile, the number of crimes recorded rose by nearly 750,000. Police say a squeeze on resources is making crime harder to investigate. The Home Office says it is working with police to find a solution. You need a modern browser to view the interactive content in this page. If the police force lookup does not load clickhere,external. The picture in Northern Ireland and Scotland is different. Charges have fallen at the same rate as recorded crime in Northern Ireland. In Scotland where the criminal justice system is different, they record clear-ups, a broader category than charges  - these have fallen in line with recorded crime. West Yorkshire Police Chief Constable Dee Collins says things are stretched. ""My officers and staff, I think do a fantastic job with the resource that we have, but I realise that we are letting some people down,"" she said. ""Since 2010 we've had a 35% real-term cut and what that has meant in terms of officers and staff numbers is I have 1,400 fewer people."" Fewer charges means victims such as Richard Bolland are not getting justice. Last year he was attacked in the fish and chip shop he runs in Wyke, near Bradford. He was so severely beaten he passed out and says the attack left him looking ""like Frankenstein"". Then he was robbed. ""He took my wallets, the company money, the money to pay the suppliers, the till float, he took everything,"" Mr Bolland said. Richard Bolland was beaten about the head He says the initial response from the police was good, but he feels let down by CID. No-one was ever caught and he was told by the police that if he could come up with a lead to help them, then he should let them know. ""Other than that it was on the shelf. And since then I've not heard a single thing from them."" West Yorkshire Police say that despite receiving tip-offs about who attacked Mr Bolland they could not gather enough evidence to bring them in. They say they have reviewed the case and believe they responded in the right way. ""I think there is an emerging crisis and it's a crisis that's right at the heart of policing, the investigation of crime,"" says Peter Neyroud, a former chief constable. He describes the fall in charges as significant and depressing. Home Office minister Victoria Atkins says the government is looking at this problem ""very carefully"" to see whether there is a problem at force level or if there is something it can do nationally. ""We want to ensure that when a victim reports a crime to the police that it's investigated properly and thoroughly and that any charges that are appropriate are made,"" she said. The number of crimes recorded by police in England and Wales has risen by nearly 750,000 in the last three years. Some of this rise is because police are recording crime better. In early 2014 an investigation by the House of Commons Public Administration Select Committee found that forces had been under-recording crime. As a result data audits are being carried out on each force by the Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary. But some crimes are genuinely up. If you look at the more accurate Crime Survey for England and Wales, offences such as burglary, robbery and some violent crimes are rising. Either way the police have more cases to investigate than they did in 2014. Knife crime rises 22% Reality Check - Is crime up or down? The reduction in charges follow a period of cuts for the police. There are about 20,000 fewer police officers in England and Wales than there were in 2010. ""That's four and a half million policing days of investigation,"" said Mr Neyroud. He says there is also an increased demand for the police service to investigate more rapes, modern slavery, terrorism and organised crime. Forces are having to make tough choices, Dee Collins says ""That's shifting all the experienced resources into those areas and leaving a considerable drop in the expertise in dealing with the basic day-to-day crimes which are the ones that most of the public are concerned about."" He believes this is leading to police screening crimes for those they feel they can investigate successfully and those they can't. In West Yorkshire, Ms Collins admits they are having to make pragmatic decisions about which crimes to follow up. ""For example if it was an elderly victim and something that might feel fairly low-level we will probably still attend. If perhaps it had been myself ringing about a particular issue we might not. "" It has certainly shaken Mr Bolland's faith in the abilities of the police. ""The thin blue line, it's a dotted line now and the dots are getting further and further apart,"" he says. Richard Bolland back in his chip shop Tight resources and rising crime have brought back bad memories for Mr Neyroud from his time in the police. ""We spent more of our time apologising for what we weren't able to do than doing what we were able. ""The police service appears to me to be in that position again.""

For recorded crime we have used: 'Police recorded crime open data Police Force Area tables from year ending March 2013 onwards' We calculated percentage change using the data for the first and last years in our time period. In the crime categories chart we have removed any category with fewer than 50 charges in the base year of 2014-15. This is consistent with methodology used by the Office for National Statistics.

"The Farnese Blue diamond passed down through generations of royal families A rare blue diamond that has spent the past 300 years in Europe's royal houses has been sold at auction in Geneva for $6.7m (Â£5m). The Farnese Blue was given as a wedding present to Elizabeth Farnese, daughter of the Duke of Parma, when she married Philip V of Spain in 1715. It then passed down through the generations, moving from Spain to France, Italy and Austria. The 6.1 carat diamond comes from the famous Golconda mine of India. It sold after just four minutes of bidding at Sotheby's, easily passing the auction house's estimate of $3.5m-$5m. ""We were expecting a good result but we started from $3.5m and we ended up with $6.7m, so we exceeded our expectation,"" said Sotheby's jewellery specialist, Daniela Mascetti. ""Good jewels, well-designed, well-made, with a signature, with a perfect... slot in time, in age, do very well.""

"This video can not be played How to talk to North Korea - advice from three North Korean experts North Korea has cancelled Wednesday's high-level talks with South Korea because of anger over its joint military exercises with the US. The North's official KCNA news agency said the exercises were a ""provocation"" and a rehearsal for an invasion. It also warned the US over the fate of the historic summit between Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump that is scheduled for 12 June in Singapore. In March, Mr Trump stunned the world by accepting an invitation to meet Mr Kim. ""We will both try to make it a very special moment for World Peace!"" the US leader later tweeted. The US state department said it was continuing to prepare for the Trump-Kim summit and that it was not aware of any changes in the North Korean position. The political gamble of the 21st Century How does North Korea's Kim Jong-un travel? North Korea crisis in 300 words In short, the scheduled talks with South Korea were a follow-up to a rare summit that was held on 27 April. They were agreed earlier this week and were set to take place at Panmunjom, a military compound in the demilitarised zone between the two countries that is often referred to as the ""truce town"". Representatives had planned to discuss further details of the agreements they had made at the historic summit. This covers things like ridding the peninsula of nuclear weapons and turning the armistice that ended the Korean War in 1953 into a peace treaty. Other points the leaders agreed in a joint statement were: An end to ""hostile activities"" between the two nations Changing the demilitarised zone (DMZ) that divides the country into a ""peace zone"" by ceasing propaganda broadcasts An arms reduction in the region pending the easing of military tension To push for four-way talks involving the US and China This video can not be played Kim Jong-un issues his pledge for peace with South Korea Joint military drills between the US and South Korea have often angered the North. In the past, they have threatened an ""all-out offensive"" in response to the exercises and condemned them as pouring ""gasoline on fire"". The latest drills - known as Max Thunder - involve some 100 warplanes, including an unspecified number of B-52 bombers and F-15K jets. The North has described them as a ""provocation"" and preparation for a future invasion, which is something they have said before. But the US and South Korea have always insisted the drills are purely for defence purposes, and based out of a mutual defence agreement they signed in 1953. They also say the exercises are necessary to strengthen their readiness in case of an external attack. The US and South Korea insist their joint military drills are purely for defence purposes It depends who you ask. North Korea fired a warning shot at the US when it announced it was cancelling Wednesday's talks with the South. ""The United States will also have to undertake careful deliberations about the fate of the planned North Korea-US summit in light of this provocative military ruckus jointly conducted with the South Korean authorities,"" the KCNA report said. The BBC's South Korea correspondent Laura Bicker says the wording of the statement showedNorth Korea was casting doubt over talks, rather than saying they were about to be cancelled.,external Will historic Koreas summit lead to peace? The Koreas - the basics explained But the US was quick to resist any suggestion that the summit was now in doubt. ""We will continue to plan the meeting,"" a state department spokeswoman told reporters soon after the news of the cancelled talks broke. She added that the US had received ""no notification"" of a change in the North's position.

"This video can not be played Samantha Markle told Good Morning Britain their father had suffered a heart attack More doubt has been cast on whether Meghan Markle's father will attend his daughter's wedding to Prince Harry on Saturday, as it is reported he is due to have heart surgery. Thomas Markle had told US website TMZ he would not go amid a row overpaparazzi photographs,external; then that he would; then that he could not, due to a planned heart procedure. Kensington Palace declined to comment. Ms Markle's estranged half-sister said he had faced an ""unbelievable stress"". Speaking to Australia's Sunrise morning TV programme from Orlando, Florida, Samantha Markle said she was not sure if Mr Markle would be travelling to Windsor. ""He sent me a message that he was undergoing heart surgery,"" she said. ""We're all hoping he pulls through this now."" Meanwhile, Kensington Palace has announcedPrincess Charlotte will be among the bridesmaidsand her brother Prince George will be a pageboy at the wedding this weekend. Royal wedding: All you need to know Who is Meghan Markle? Princess Charlotte to be bridesmaid Who else could walk Meghan Markle down the aisle? Mr Markle became embroiled in controversy at the weekend, following reports that he staged paparazzi photographs of himself in the run-up to the wedding. The pictures showed Mr Markle - apparently unaware he was being photographed - in a series of wedding-related activities, including being measured for a wedding suit. On Monday, Mr Markle reportedlytold celebrity news website TMZ,externalthat he would not attend the wedding. TMZ later reported,externalthat Mr Markle had and wanted to attend - although he might not be able to because of health concerns. Andin a third report, the website,externalsaid that the health issues and planned surgery would prevent him from attending after all. Meghan's father, Thomas, lives in Mexico On Tuesday evening, BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell said Ms Markle wanted her father to be there, but her major concern would be for his wellbeing. Kensington Palace has said events are ""a deeply personal moment for Ms Markle"". ""She and Prince Harry ask again for understanding and respect to be extended to Mr Markle in this difficult situation,"" the palace said in a statement on Monday. By Jonny Dymond, BBC royal correspondent One minute there's a perfectly scripted wedding about to reach its traditional-yet-modern, royal-yet-diverse climax in the St George's chapel at Windsor.  The next minute there's twists and turns worthy of the finest soap opera. It is difficult to believe that things are quite where the various Palaces involved in this wedding thought they would be at this stage. It is of course conceivable that Thomas Markle could have heart surgery at today, somehow find the energy to make a transatlantic flight, meet the Queen, go to the wedding and walk his daughter down the aisle. But it seems a little unlikely. So who will walk Meghan down the aisle? Who will step under the standards of the Knights of the Garter, over the vault containing the remains of Henry VIII and Charles I and past 600 of years of Royal, English and British history? Will it be Meghan's mother Doria, or will she walk alone? Now, there's a thought. Read more from Jonny Mr Markle had been due to meet Prince Harry for the first time this week,as well as the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, before walking his daughter down the aisle at St George's Chapel in Windsor Castle. Samantha, who has not spoken to her famous sibling in three years - and will not be attending the wedding - told Good Morning Britain the photographs had been done with ""good intention"" and not for money. She previously admitted the pictures had been her idea, in order to portray a positive image. The father of the ex-Suits actress lives in Mexico and is a former lighting director who worked on programmes including the 1980s TV show Married with Children and General Hospital, for which he and his team won two Emmy awards. He and Ms Markle's mother, Doria Ragland, divorced when Ms Markle was six years old. TMZ - which launched in 2005 - stands for Thirty-Mile Zone, an old Hollywood expression that describes the area where the studios are based and where most celebrities happen to live. The US celebrity news site, which scooped the world's media on Thomas Markle's wedding plans, is no stranger to a-list exclusives (albeit not without controversy): Deaths- The showbiz site broke the news of Michael Jackson's death in June 2009 and was the first to report Prince had died in April 2016. But in 2008, TMZ was forced to remove an article wrongly reporting singer Miley Cyrus had died in a car accident and in 2013, it falsely reported rapper Lil Wayne was on his death bed Break-ups- In November 2006, TMZ revealed pop princess Britney Spears was to divorce her then husband Keven Federline and ten years later, broke the news of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie's split Babies- In September 2017, TMZ revealed reality star Kylie Jenner was pregnant and that Travis Scott was the father Mr Markle, who has two children - including Samantha - from his first marriage, filed for bankruptcy two years ago. Ms Markle has previously said: ""It's safe to say I have always been a daddy's girl - he taught me how to fish, to appreciate Busby Berkeley films, write thank-you notes, and spend my weekends in Little Tokyo eating chicken teriyaki with vegetable tempura."" Royal fans are already camped outside Windsor Castle in preparation for the big day The wedding will take place on 19 May at 12:00 BST at St George's Chapel in Windsor. With five days to go, Kensington Palace revealed that Ms Markle will spend her last night before getting married at a luxury Buckinghamshire hotel with her mother, Doria.

"This video can not be played Anwar Ibrahim says the opposition's election victory is ""a new dawn"" for Malaysia. Reformist politician Anwar Ibrahim has hailed a ""new dawn"" for Malaysia on his release from prison, days after a stunning opposition election win. Mr Anwar told jubilant supporters he fully backed his ally and former rival, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed. Earlier he was pardoned from what was widely seen as a politically motivated conviction for sodomy. Mr Mahathir, who sought the pardon, has promised to step aside for Mr Anwar to become prime minister within two years. Once seen as a future leader, Anwar Ibrahim then fell out with the government. He was jailed for a second time three years ago on what he said were trumped-up sodomy charges. After his release, he told a news conference he thanked the people of Malaysia, who ""stood by the principles of democracy and freedom"". ""They demand change."" Mr Anwar said he had forgiven Mr Mahathir and stressed he would give full support to the new government, though not immediately be part of it. Allow Twitter content?

""I and Mahathir have buried the hatchet already, it was a long time ago,"" Mr Anwar told the news conference at his home. For years he had headed Malaysia's opposition movement, which last week defeated the former ruling party for the first time in the country's history. Last week's shock election victory followed a reconciliation between Mr Anwar and his 92-year-old erstwhile political mentor, who sacked and jailed him 20 years ago during his first stint as prime minister. Some prison officers celebrated Mr Anwar's moment of freedom with him Mr Anwar walked free out of a hospital in the capital Kuala Lumpur where he had been undergoing treatment for a shoulder problem. Supporters camped out at the hospital trailed him to the Istana Negara royal palace where he met Mr Mahathir before being pardoned by the king. ""Long live Anwar,"" supporters on motorbikes yelled as they pulled into the royal compound in support of their newly-freed leader. ""He is a symbol of freedom to Malaysians like me,"" 59-year old Ahmad Samsuddin told the BBC. ""Finally. It feels like the tide of change is turning in Malaysia after so many years of injustice. Today is a historic day with Anwar's release and will get even better."" Anwar Ibrahim: Malaysia's leader-in-waiting What just happened in Malaysia? Corruption, money and Malaysia's election The story of the relationship between Mr Mahathir and Mr Anwar is one of extraordinary twists and turns. During the 1990s they were political allies, serving as prime minister and deputy prime minister respectively. But Mr Anwar was sacked in 1998 and jailed a year later for abuse of power. In 2000 he was convicted of sodomy and given an additional nine-year jail term. In 2004 his conviction was overturned and he led the opposition to unprecedented gains - though remained short of victory - in the 2008 and 2013 general elections. A year later when he was heading into a state election he seemed likely to win, he was sent back to jail. Events took a remarkable turn earlier this year, when Mr Mahathir announced he would join forces with the opposition and run for top office once again. This video can not be played Malaysian voters react in 2018 to Mahathir Mohamad's victory over Najib Razak Mr Mahathir said he was sick of the corruption allegations plaguing the incumbent, Najib Razak, another of his former allies. One condition for Mr Mahathir being allowed to lead the opposition coalition was that he agreed to secure a royal pardon for Mr Anwar who remained popular with his supporters.

"North Korea's belligerent threat to call off landmark talks with the US - currently slated for 12 June in Singapore - is a remarkable turnaround. Just last month, the world watched on as North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un planted peace trees and held hands with South Korean President Moon Jae-in. At the time,Mr Kim pledged a ""new history"" in relations with his neighbourand said it was the ""starting point"" for peace between the two Koreas. Mr Kim has also said, ahead of the upcoming Singapore meeting, that North Korea would halt nuclear and missile tests immediately. (The US wants Pyongyang to give up its weapons programme completely and irreversibly.) Now though, that may not happen. But frankly, given the unpredictable nature of the North and its leader, this latest development can hardly be labelled a surprise. As I've written before, the Singapore meeting is very much a business one for Washington and Pyongyang - and so the North is now simply laying out the terms of the deal it wants, well ahead of any meeting taking place. North Korea's economy partly relies on foreign trade Kim Jong-un hasn't been shy about his focus on the North's economy.  He's repeatedly said he is committed to the so-called dual strategy of Byungjin -developing both nuclear weapons and the economy simultaneously. In April of this year though, about five years after announcing his Byungjin policy,Kim Jong-un said the North had achieved what it needed to on the nuclear front,external, and could now shift its concentration to the economy. Which is why it was no surprise the US has said that any private investment in North Koreais contingent on the country's commitment to full denuclearisation. N Korea threatens to cancel Trump summit Economic pain pushes N Korea to talks Did sanctions push N Korea into US talks? North Korea frees US detainees Focusing on the economy is something Pyongyang is under pressure to do. The implementation of UN and US sanctions have started to hurt North Korea's economy. So too have moves by the US to force other countries, including China, to cut trade with the pariah state. As I wrote earlier this year,data shows that North Korea's economy has been taking a hit from sanctions. North Korean exports may have declined by 30% in 2017. In particular, exports to China, North Korea's biggest trading partner, are down as much as 35%. That's wiped out a big chunk of the regime's revenue stream. The regime's elite, who Kim Jong-un needs to keep on his side, won't like that. But what's more unnerving for Pyongyang is that things could get much worse. The key issue expected to be discussed in Singapore is North Korea's nuclear weapons programme Still, the North isn't going to give up something for nothing. ""North Korea and the US have substantively different understandings of what denuclearisation means,"" The Diplomat's Ankit Panda told me. What the North really wants, is sanctions relief, he said. ""Currently there are around nine different sanctions resolutions that the North is under,"" Mr Panda added. ""This makes sanctions relief impossible. Even though South Korea may be positively disposed towards the North, nothing can happen without the UN and the US."" Nine charts which tell you all you need to know about North Korea US may allow private investment in N Korea What was Kim Jong-un's most used word? Which is why these latest comments from the North should be seen as diplomatic brinkmanship - or a test of the US' willingness to offer concessions, as William Newcomb, a former member of the UN Panel of Experts told me. But whether this strategy will work is questionable and many analysts say the prospect of a down payment in the form of an easing of sanctions to ensure the Singapore talks go ahead, would be surprising. ""The UN Security Council would have to act to remove, modify or suspend international sanctions,"" says Mr Newcomb. ""In my opinion, it would take considerable progress towards denuclearisation to obtain international consent for sanctions relief sufficient to make any difference. US leadership would be indispensable."" Which may be why Pyongyang is playing this game. It wants to make sure that the US knows how much is at stake and to ensure it has the leverage to get what it's really after - guarantees that its economy can survive.

"There are warnings universities do not see the ""day-to-day racism"" on campus Universities are being accused of ""complacency"" over a lack of senior black academics and lower achievement among ethnic minority students. Baroness Amos, the UK's first black woman university head, says there are ""deep-seated prejudices and stereotypes which need to be overcome"". ""Not even 1% of UK professors are black,"" she will tell a conference on university leadership. The Office for Students says tackling such ""gaps"" should be a priority. Speaking ahead of the conference, Baroness Amos, director of the School of Oriental and African Studies (Soas), in London, said universities liked to see themselves as ""inclusive and internationalist"". But she said there has been ""anger and frustration"" among ethnic minority academic staff at their under-representation in senior jobs and the achievement gap for ethnic minority students. Baroness Amos was the UK's first black female university head when she became director of Soas She will address the Black and Minority Ethnic (BME) Leadership for Higher Education Summit on Wednesday, organised by Advance HE, a new agency that will promote equal opportunities in universities. Some of the examples of gaps in representation and achievement to be presented are: Out of more than 18,000 professors at UK universities, only about 110 are black Only 3.2% of academic managers, directors and senior officials are from ethnic minorities There is an average 16% pay gap between UK-domiciled white and ethnic minority academic managers, directors and senior officials There is a 15 percentage point gap between ethnic minority and white students getting first-class or upper-second degree grades There is a higher dropout rates for black undergraduates Baroness Amos says that conversations about racism are difficult, because the debate often ""degenerates"" into arguments about whether individuals or viewpoints are racist. But that misses the bigger picture of deep-rooted, ""insidious"", institutional prejudice. ""As a black person I know how hard it is to explain the pernicious and debilitating impact of day-to-day racism,"" she says. ""Many of us don't talk about it, but that doesn't mean it's not there."" There is much ""rhetoric"" about inclusivity and equality in universities, says Baroness Amos, which could cause ""complacency"" and a ""slow pace of change"". ""University leaders need to acknowledge that we are not doing enough,"" she says. Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of the Office for Students, says the new watchdog recognises ""gaps in outcomes between students in certain ethnic groups"". ""Addressing these gaps, so that students from all backgrounds are able not just to get into higher education, but get on too, is a priority for the Office for Students,"" said Ms Dandridge, who will also address the conference. There have been a series of recent claims of racism on campuses. Earlier this month Exeter University expelled students afterallegations of ""vile"" racist languageonline. The National Union of Students has claimed that universities can be ""more concerned about their reputation"" than tackling racism.

"John Bolton's nomination as US ambassador to the UN during the Bush Administration proved controversial John Bolton, a hawkish conservative who rose to prominence in the George W Bush administration, will be the new National Security Adviser to President Donald Trump. A firm defender of American power and a confrontational advocate for wielding that strength abroad, Mr Bolton has never shied away from making his strong views known - whether from a government perch, in the pages of newspapers or from a Fox News pulpit. Here are five things he believes. Mr Bolton's views on North Korea will draw intense scrutiny as he joins the White House, given a looming summit between President Trump and Kim Jong-un expected to take place by May. The incoming National Security Adviser has made it clear that he believes that North Korea and its nuclear programme pose an ""imminent threat"" to the US, dismissing those who would argue that Washington still has time for diplomacy. ""Given the gaps in US intelligence about North Korea, we should not wait until the very last minute,""he wrote in the Wall Street Journal in February of possible pre-emptive action.,external ""It is perfectly legitimate for the United States to respond to the current ""necessity"" posed by North Korea's nuclear weapons by striking first."" Donald Trump is reported to have got rid of his secretary of state Rex Tillerson due to their opposing views on the Iran nuclear deal, which the US president has been deeply critical of. In John Bolton, he will find someone whose views are much more aligned with his. Mr Bolton has lambasted Barack Obama for agreeing the 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran, writing last year that the text of the agreement ""created huge loopholes, and Iran is now driving its missile and nuclear programs straight through them"". In March 2015, a few months before the deal was agreed,he argued in the New York Times that only military action would suffice.,external ""Time is terribly short, but a strike can still succeed,"" he said, advocating Israeli action specifically. ""Such action should be combined with vigorous American support for Iran's opposition, aimed at regime change in Tehran."" Bush-era hawk makes comeback Why did Trump dump his security adviser?

""There is an international community that occasionally can be led by the only real power left in the world, and that's the United States, when it suits our interests and when we can get others to go along."" That speech was made more than a decade before he was nominated by the George W Bush administration to be US ambassador to the UN - but Mr Bolton's scepticism of a global body accountable to no one sovereign nation is deeply held. The Economist called him ""the most controversial ambassador ever sent by America to the United Nations"", but he also won praise in some quarters, for fiercely pushing for reform of the international institution. Just a few weeks ago, the president was calling the US-led invasion in 2003, ""the single worst decision ever made"". Around the same time, John Bolton, who backed it strongly, was refusing to condemn it. ""When you say the overthrow of Saddam Hussein was a mistake, it's simplistic,""he is reported to have said in a Fox News appearance.,external In 2016, when he was mulling a bid for the Republican presidential nomination, Mr Bolton was less equivocal. ""If you knew everything you do today, of course you'd make different choices, but I'd still overthrow Saddam Hussein, who was a threat to peace and stability in the region,""the Washington Post quoted him as saying.,external Mr Bolton has described Russian interference in the 2016 US election as a ""true act of war, and one Washington will never tolerate"". In July 2017, when President Trump met President Putin and the Russian leader denied Russian meddling, Mr Bolton wrote that he was ""lying with the benefit of the best KGB training"". More recently, following the poisoning of ex-spy Sergei Skripial in the UK - an attack blamed on Russia - Mr Bolton said the West should respond with a ""very strong answer"".

"Disruption to the body's internal clock may put people at increased risk of mood disorders, scientists say. A clock ticks in nearly every cell of the body. And they change how the tissues work in a daily rhythm. ALancet Psychiatry,externalstudy of 91,000 people found a disrupted body clock was linked with depression, bipolar disorder and other problems. The Glasgow researchers said it was a warning to societies becoming less in tune with these natural rhythms. Although the study did not look at mobile phone use, Prof Daniel Smith, one of the University of Glasgow researchers, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that it was ""likely"" that some of the people in the study who had difficulties might be using social media at night. ""For me absolutely my mobile phone goes off before 22:00 at night and that's it, because obviously we didn't evolve to be looking at screens when we should be sleeping,"" he said. Six tips for a good night's sleep Should I pay more attention to my body clock? What I learned by living without artificial light Should we all become early risers? WATCH: How does a lack of sleep impact your brain? People in the study wore activity monitors for a week to see how disrupted their clocks were. Those who were highly active at night or inactive during the day were classed as being disrupted. And they were between 6% and 10% more likely to have been diagnosed with a mood disorder than people who had a more typical - active in the day, inactive at night - pattern. Prof Smith, a psychiatrist, told the BBC: ""These are not huge differences. ""But what is striking is it is pretty robust across lots of interesting outcomes."" The study found higher rates of major depression, bipolar disorder, more loneliness, lower happiness, worse reaction times and more mood instability in people with body-clock disruption. However, the study cannot tell if the disruption is causing the mental illness or is just a symptom of it. That will take further work. The body clock certainly exerts a powerful effect throughout the body. Mood, hormone levels, body temperature and metabolism all fluctuate in a daily rhythm. Even the risk of a heart attack soars every morning as the body gets the engine running to start a new day. Prof Smith said: ""The study tells us the body clock is really important for mood disorders and should be given greater priority in research and in way we organise societies. ""It wouldn't be too controversial to say we need to reorganise the way we learn and work to be in tune with our natural rhythms."" The study used data from the UK's Biobank research project. However, many of the participants were quite old. Dr Aiden Doherty, from the University of Oxford, said: ""The study population is not ideal to examine the causes of mental health, given that 75% of disorders start before the age of 24 years."" But he added the study showed the way for a similar research in ""adolescents and younger adults to help transform our understanding of the causes and consequences, prevention, and treatment of mental health disorders"".

"The reduction in charges follow a period of cuts for the police The number of criminal charges being brought in England and Wales has been falling - despite more crimes being recorded in the same period. BBC analysis of Home Office data for Panorama shows 527,000 charges were brought in 2016-17 - a fall of 65,000 on 2014-15. Meanwhile, the number of crimes recorded rose by nearly 750,000. Police say a squeeze on resources is making crime harder to investigate. The Home Office says it is working with police to find a solution. You need a modern browser to view the interactive content in this page. If the police force lookup does not load clickhere,external. The picture in Northern Ireland and Scotland is different. Charges have fallen at the same rate as recorded crime in Northern Ireland. In Scotland where the criminal justice system is different, they record clear-ups, a broader category than charges  - these have fallen in line with recorded crime. West Yorkshire Police Chief Constable Dee Collins says things are stretched. ""My officers and staff, I think do a fantastic job with the resource that we have, but I realise that we are letting some people down,"" she said. ""Since 2010 we've had a 35% real-term cut and what that has meant in terms of officers and staff numbers is I have 1,400 fewer people."" Fewer charges means victims such as Richard Bolland are not getting justice. Last year he was attacked in the fish and chip shop he runs in Wyke, near Bradford. He was so severely beaten he passed out and says the attack left him looking ""like Frankenstein"". Then he was robbed. ""He took my wallets, the company money, the money to pay the suppliers, the till float, he took everything,"" Mr Bolland said. Richard Bolland was beaten about the head He says the initial response from the police was good, but he feels let down by CID. No-one was ever caught and he was told by the police that if he could come up with a lead to help them, then he should let them know. ""Other than that it was on the shelf. And since then I've not heard a single thing from them."" West Yorkshire Police say that despite receiving tip-offs about who attacked Mr Bolland they could not gather enough evidence to bring them in. They say they have reviewed the case and believe they responded in the right way. ""I think there is an emerging crisis and it's a crisis that's right at the heart of policing, the investigation of crime,"" says Peter Neyroud, a former chief constable. He describes the fall in charges as significant and depressing. Home Office minister Victoria Atkins says the government is looking at this problem ""very carefully"" to see whether there is a problem at force level or if there is something it can do nationally. ""We want to ensure that when a victim reports a crime to the police that it's investigated properly and thoroughly and that any charges that are appropriate are made,"" she said. The number of crimes recorded by police in England and Wales has risen by nearly 750,000 in the last three years. Some of this rise is because police are recording crime better. In early 2014 an investigation by the House of Commons Public Administration Select Committee found that forces had been under-recording crime. As a result data audits are being carried out on each force by the Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary. But some crimes are genuinely up. If you look at the more accurate Crime Survey for England and Wales, offences such as burglary, robbery and some violent crimes are rising. Either way the police have more cases to investigate than they did in 2014. Knife crime rises 22% Reality Check - Is crime up or down? The reduction in charges follow a period of cuts for the police. There are about 20,000 fewer police officers in England and Wales than there were in 2010. ""That's four and a half million policing days of investigation,"" said Mr Neyroud. He says there is also an increased demand for the police service to investigate more rapes, modern slavery, terrorism and organised crime. Forces are having to make tough choices, Dee Collins says ""That's shifting all the experienced resources into those areas and leaving a considerable drop in the expertise in dealing with the basic day-to-day crimes which are the ones that most of the public are concerned about."" He believes this is leading to police screening crimes for those they feel they can investigate successfully and those they can't. In West Yorkshire, Ms Collins admits they are having to make pragmatic decisions about which crimes to follow up. ""For example if it was an elderly victim and something that might feel fairly low-level we will probably still attend. If perhaps it had been myself ringing about a particular issue we might not. "" It has certainly shaken Mr Bolland's faith in the abilities of the police. ""The thin blue line, it's a dotted line now and the dots are getting further and further apart,"" he says. Richard Bolland back in his chip shop Tight resources and rising crime have brought back bad memories for Mr Neyroud from his time in the police. ""We spent more of our time apologising for what we weren't able to do than doing what we were able. ""The police service appears to me to be in that position again."" Data Analysis by Wesley Stephenson, Ransome Mpini, and William Dahlgreen.  Design and development by Sumi Senthinathan, Steven Connor, and Becky Rush. Methodology: 1. England and Wales We have looked at the outcomes data and recorded crime data for the three years between 2014-15 and 2016-17. 2016-17 is the latest full year for which we have data. Method for calculating change in recorded crime and charges: For charges we have used: 'Outcomes open data year ending March' for 2014-15, 2015-16, 2016-17 taking the data for charges recorded in each particular year. For recorded crime we have used: 'Police recorded crime open data Police Force Area tables from year ending March 2013 onwards' We calculated percentage change using the data for the first and last years in our time period. In the crime categories chart we have removed any category with fewer than 50 charges in the base year of 2014-15. This is consistent with methodology used by the Office for National Statistics. Data,external 2. Northern Ireland For the PSNI we only have two years of data 2015-16 and 2016-17. PSNI use the same crime categories and recording methods as England and Wales. To calculate the PSNI percentage change we have used the data for the first and last years in our time period. Data,external 3. Scotland Police Scotland has different crime categories to England and Wales and it also uses the broader category of 'clear ups' rather than charges. The data we use for Scotland is as follows: Scotland (data coverage dates 2015-16 to 2016-17) Data,external 4. Chart 1: Recorded crime is up but charges are down. For the years between 2007-8 and 2016-17 we have used the same data as above plus: 'Police recorded crime open data Police Force Area tables from March 2008 to March 2012'.  To calculate change we have excluded fraud offences and then calculated the year- on-year change in total recorded crime and the year on year change in total charges for England and Wales.

But in 2008, TMZ was forced to remove an article wrongly reporting singer Miley Cyrus had died in a car accident and in 2013, it falsely reported rapper Lil Wayne was on his death bed Break-ups- In November 2006, TMZ revealed pop princess Britney Spears was to divorce her then husband Keven Federline and ten years later, broke the news of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie's split Babies- In September 2017, TMZ revealed reality star Kylie Jenner was pregnant and that Travis Scott was the father Mr Markle, who has two children - including Samantha - from his first marriage, filed for bankruptcy two years ago.

But in 2008, TMZ was forced to remove an article wrongly reporting singer Miley Cyrus had died in a car accident and in 2013, it falsely reported rapper Lil Wayne was on his death bed Break-ups- In November 2006, TMZ revealed pop princess Britney Spears was to divorce her then husband Keven Federline and ten years later, broke the news of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie's split Babies- In September 2017, TMZ revealed reality star Kylie Jenner was pregnant and that Travis Scott was the father Mr Markle, who has two children - including Samantha - from his first marriage, filed for bankruptcy two years ago. Ms Markle has previously said: ""It's safe to say I have always been a daddy's girl - he taught me how to fish, to appreciate Busby Berkeley films, write thank-you notes, and spend my weekends in Little Tokyo eating chicken teriyaki with vegetable tempura."" Royal fans are already camped outside Windsor Castle in preparation for the big day The wedding will take place on 19 May at 12:00 BST at St George's Chapel in Windsor. With five days to go, Kensington Palace revealed that Ms Markle will spend her last night before getting married at a luxury Buckinghamshire hotel with her mother, Doria.

"More than 1,600 IT specialists and engineers offered jobs in the UK were denied visas between December and March, BBC News has learned. They were denied because the number applying exceeded the monthly limit allowed to enter the UK. Critics argue that the immigration policy will hamper the government's efforts to develop a high-tech economy. The government said it was important that employers look to recruit from the UK before looking overseas. The figures were obtained by the Campaign for Science and Engineering (Case). Case's executive director, Dr Sarah Main, said that job offers in areas where there were clear shortages, such as science and engineering, should be exempt from the Home Office cap. ""The tragedy is that this policy doesn't work for anyone: the government, employers or the public,"" she said. ""The government repeats its mantra that Britain should be open to the brightest and the best, and yet this policy specifically rejects those people."" Between December 2017 and March 2018, the Home Office received an unexpectedly high volume of applications from employers who had offered jobs to non-EU workers. The so-called Tier 2 visa system was introduced by Theresa May when she was home secretary as a means of capping the number of skilled workers from outside the European Union who had a job offer. Their prospective employers had to demonstrate that they had not been able to find a suitable applicant in the UK. Until December 2017, the limit had been exceeded once in almost six years this was in June 2015 when 66 applications were refused for engineering roles. The cap is set at 20,700 per year, with a monthly limit of about 1,600. Home Office figures show that in December, January and February nearly half of all applicants were denied visas and in March the number of refusals exceeded 50% for the first time. Case submitted a freedom of information request to the Home Office for a breakdown of these figures by profession. It confirms that healthcare workers are the largest group to be denied visas. But it shows for the first time that hundreds of IT specialists and engineers needed by UK firms are also being turned down. Between December and March, 1,226 IT specialists and 383 engineers were denied visas to take up jobs they had been offered. In addition 1,876 medical practitioners and healthcare workers, 197 teachers and 584 other professions were unable to take up their job offers in the UK. It is unclear why there has been this surge in applications but one possibility is that it may be because European Union workers are either leaving the UK or not applying for jobs in anticipation of Brexit. In March, Dr Main sent a letter to the prime minister, asking her to revise the current system. In it she said: ""Training and attracting talented people is critical to the success of the government's industrial strategy and to the UK's productivity. Productivity will suffer if firms cannot access the talent they need."" Matthew Fell, the CBI's UK policy director, said UK firms were suffering as a result of the policy. ""A migration system that forces a binary choice between staffing our NHS or growing the UK economy is clearly broken,"" he said. ""We need both. At a time when government is seeking to promote 'global Britain', deliberately restricting access to skilled workers from around the world is self-defeating. ""This data shows highly skilled workers, who meet the requirements of the UK's points based system, are being turned away because of an arbitrary cap that puts numbers before people's contribution. At the very least, government should remove shortage roles from the cap."" A Home Office spokesman said: ""The government fully recognises the contribution that international professionals make to the UK. ""However, it is important that our immigration system works in the national interest, ensuring that employers look first to the UK resident labour market before recruiting from overseas."" ""When demand exceeds the monthly available allocation of Tier 2 (General) places, priority is given to applicants filling a shortage or PhD-level occupations. No occupation on the Shortage Occupation List has been refused a place."" Prof Venki Ramakrishnan, the president of the UK's Royal Society said that the restrictions would hold Britain back. ""Computing underpins the modern world but for the foreseeable future we are going to need to recruit IT professionals from overseas,"" he said. ""Employers know and accept that there is a need for highly skilled immigrants as do the majority of the general public. The people standing in the way are those who set random immigration limits that seem to be plucked out of the air for political purposes."" Dr Julia Wilson, associate director of the Wellcome Sanger Institute, said that the system was harming UK science. ""The repeated problems over the past months have delayed important research at the Sanger Institute,"" she explained. ""Genomics is a sector vital for the delivery of the government's industrial strategy and for the UK economy. The failure to foresee or then remedy these problems show the system is not fit for purpose.""

"Anne Frank's diary, written in hiding from the Nazis, is widely read more than 70 years after her death Two new pages from Anne Frank's diary have been published, containing a handful of dirty jokes and her thoughts on sex. The young Jewish teen's diary, written in hiding from the Nazis,  became world-famous when published after her death and at the end of the war. The hidden pages had been covered with gummed brown paper - apparently to hide her risquÃ© writing from her family. New imaging techniques have finally allowed researchers to read them. The entries were written on 28 September 1942, not long after the 13-year-old Anne went into hiding. ""I'll use this spoiled page to write down 'dirty' jokes"", she wrote on a page with a handful of crossed-out phrases - and jotted down four dirty jokes she knew. She added a few dozen lines about sex education, imagining she has to give ""the talk"" to someone else, and mentioning prostitutes - who she wrote elsewhere that her father had told her about.

""Anne Frank writes about sexuality in a disarming way,"" said Ronald Leopold of the Anne Frank House museum in Amsterdam. ""Like every adolescent she is curious about this subject."" The sentiment was echoed by Frank van Vree, director of the Niod institute, which helped decipher the pages from new photographs taken in 2016. ""Anyone who reads the passages that have now been discovered will be unable to suppress a smile,"" he said. ""The 'dirty' jokes are classics among growing children. They make it clear that Anne, with all her gifts, was above all also an ordinary girl."" The world's most-read diary as a graphic novel 'Anne Frank' costume sparks controversy The Holocaust: Who are the missing million? One of the jokes reads: ""Do you know why the German Wehrmacht girls are in the Netherlands? As mattresses for the soldiers."" The Anne Frank Museum said this was not the only time the teenage girl wrote about sex - mentioning other jokes she had heard the people in her hidden home tell, or the passages about her periods and sexuality. Writing about the decision to publish pages that Anne clearly wanted to keep hidden, the museum said that her diary - a Unesco-registered world heritage document - held significant academic interest. But it also said that the pages ""do not alter our image of Anne"". ""Over the decades Anne has grown to become the worldwide symbol of the Holocaust, and Anne the girl has increasingly faded into the background,"" it said in a statement. ""These - literally - uncovered texts bring the inquisitive and in many respects precocious teenager back into the foreground."" Anne Frank went into hiding in a secret annexe of her father's business on 5 July 1942 - about a month after she received a diary for her 13th birthday. She lived there with her family and their friends, the Van Pels, until their discovery two years later. How they were found after so long in successful hiding remains a mystery. Anne Frank died of disease in a Nazi death camp in 1945, the year the war ended. Her father, the only family member to survive, published her diary in 1947.

"There are warnings universities do not see the ""day-to-day racism"" on campus Universities are being accused of ""complacency"" over a lack of senior black academics and lower achievement among ethnic minority students. Baroness Amos, the UK's first black woman university head, says there are ""deep-seated prejudices and stereotypes which need to be overcome"". ""Not even 1% of UK professors are black,"" she will tell a conference on university leadership. The Office for Students says tackling such ""gaps"" should be a priority. Speaking ahead of the conference, Baroness Amos, director of the School of Oriental and African Studies (Soas), in London, said universities liked to see themselves as ""inclusive and internationalist"". But she said there has been ""anger and frustration"" among ethnic minority academic staff at their under-representation in senior jobs and the achievement gap for ethnic minority students. Baroness Amos was the UK's first black female university head when she became director of Soas She will address the Black and Minority Ethnic (BME) Leadership for Higher Education Summit on Wednesday, organised by Advance HE, a new agency that will promote equal opportunities in universities. Some of the examples of gaps in representation and achievement to be presented are: Out of more than 18,000 professors at UK universities, only about 110 are black Only 3.2% of academic managers, directors and senior officials are from ethnic minorities There is an average 16% pay gap between UK-domiciled white and ethnic minority academic managers, directors and senior officials There is a 15 percentage point gap between ethnic minority and white students getting first-class or upper-second degree grades There is a higher dropout rates for black undergraduates Baroness Amos says that conversations about racism are difficult, because the debate often ""degenerates"" into arguments about whether individuals or viewpoints are racist. But that misses the bigger picture of deep-rooted, ""insidious"", institutional prejudice. ""As a black person I know how hard it is to explain the pernicious and debilitating impact of day-to-day racism,"" she says. ""Many of us don't talk about it, but that doesn't mean it's not there."" There is much ""rhetoric"" about inclusivity and equality in universities, says Baroness Amos, which could cause ""complacency"" and a ""slow pace of change"". ""University leaders need to acknowledge that we are not doing enough,"" she says. Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of the Office for Students, says the new watchdog recognises ""gaps in outcomes between students in certain ethnic groups"". ""Addressing these gaps, so that students from all backgrounds are able not just to get into higher education, but get on too, is a priority for the Office for Students,"" said Ms Dandridge, who will also address the conference. There have been a series of recent claims of racism on campuses. Earlier this month Exeter University expelled students afterallegations of ""vile"" racist languageonline. The National Union of Students has claimed that universities can be ""more concerned about their reputation"" than tackling racism.

"This video can not be played Anwar Ibrahim says the opposition's election victory is ""a new dawn"" for Malaysia. Reformist politician Anwar Ibrahim has hailed a ""new dawn"" for Malaysia on his release from prison, days after a stunning opposition election win. Mr Anwar told jubilant supporters he fully backed his ally and former rival, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed. Earlier he was pardoned from what was widely seen as a politically motivated conviction for sodomy. Mr Mahathir, who sought the pardon, has promised to step aside for Mr Anwar to become prime minister within two years. Once seen as a future leader, Anwar Ibrahim then fell out with the government. He was jailed for a second time three years ago on what he said were trumped-up sodomy charges. After his release, he told a news conference he thanked the people of Malaysia, who ""stood by the principles of democracy and freedom"". ""They demand change."" Mr Anwar said he had forgiven Mr Mahathir and stressed he would give full support to the new government, though not immediately be part of it. Allow Twitter content?

""I and Mahathir have buried the hatchet already, it was a long time ago,"" Mr Anwar told the news conference at his home. For years he had headed Malaysia's opposition movement, which last week defeated the former ruling party for the first time in the country's history. Last week's shock election victory followed a reconciliation between Mr Anwar and his 92-year-old erstwhile political mentor, who sacked and jailed him 20 years ago during his first stint as prime minister. Some prison officers celebrated Mr Anwar's moment of freedom with him Mr Anwar walked free out of a hospital in the capital Kuala Lumpur where he had been undergoing treatment for a shoulder problem. Supporters camped out at the hospital trailed him to the Istana Negara royal palace where he met Mr Mahathir before being pardoned by the king. ""Long live Anwar,"" supporters on motorbikes yelled as they pulled into the royal compound in support of their newly-freed leader. ""He is a symbol of freedom to Malaysians like me,"" 59-year old Ahmad Samsuddin told the BBC. ""Finally. It feels like the tide of change is turning in Malaysia after so many years of injustice. Today is a historic day with Anwar's release and will get even better."" Anwar Ibrahim: Malaysia's leader-in-waiting What just happened in Malaysia? Corruption, money and Malaysia's election The story of the relationship between Mr Mahathir and Mr Anwar is one of extraordinary twists and turns. During the 1990s they were political allies, serving as prime minister and deputy prime minister respectively. But Mr Anwar was sacked in 1998 and jailed a year later for abuse of power. In 2000 he was convicted of sodomy and given an additional nine-year jail term. In 2004 his conviction was overturned and he led the opposition to unprecedented gains - though remained short of victory - in the 2008 and 2013 general elections. A year later when he was heading into a state election he seemed likely to win, he was sent back to jail. Events took a remarkable turn earlier this year, when Mr Mahathir announced he would join forces with the opposition and run for top office once again. This video can not be played Malaysian voters react in 2018 to Mahathir Mohamad's victory over Najib Razak Mr Mahathir said he was sick of the corruption allegations plaguing the incumbent, Najib Razak, another of his former allies. One condition for Mr Mahathir being allowed to lead the opposition coalition was that he agreed to secure a royal pardon for Mr Anwar who remained popular with his supporters. Mr Mahathir agreed and further said he intended to hand the prime ministerial post to Mr Anwar within two years.

"This video can not be played Welcoming Kim Jong-un with pomp and ritual Friday's dramatic meeting between South Korean President Moon Jae-in and his North Korean counterpart, Chairman Kim Jong-un, represents an unambiguous historic breakthrough at least in terms of the image of bilateral reconciliation and the emotional uplift it has given to South Korea public opinion. Whether the agreement announced at the meeting - the new Panmunjeom Declaration for Peace, Prosperity and Unification of the Korean Peninsula - offers, in substance, the right mix of concrete measures to propel the two Koreas and the wider international community towards a lasting peace remains an open question. The symbolic impact of a North Korean leader setting foot for the first time on South Korean soil cannot be underestimated. Mr Kim's bold decision to stride confidently into nominally hostile territory reflects the young dictator's confidence and acute sense of political theatre and expertly executed timing. This video can not be played The moment Kim Jong-un crossed into South Korea His clever, seemingly spontaneous gesture to President Moon to reciprocate his step into the South by having him join him for an instance in stepping back into the North was an inspired way of asserting the equality of the two countries and their leaders. It also, by blurring the boundary between the two countries, hinted at the goal of unification that both Seoul and Pyongyang have long sought to realise. The rest of the day was full of visual firsts and a set of cleverly choreographed images of the two leaders chatting informally and intimately in the open air - deliberately advancing a powerful new narrative of the two Koreas as agents of their own destiny. Handshakes, broad smiles and bear hugs have amplified this message of Koreans determining their own future, in the process offsetting past memories of a peninsula all too often dominated by the self-interest of external great powers, whether China, Japan, or more recently, during the Cold War, the United States and the former Soviet Union. Historic summit as it happened Key moments from the meeting Read the Korean declaration in full,external Five conflicts that continued after they ended The two leaders' joint statements before the international media were another pitch perfect moment for Mr Kim to challenge the world's preconceptions. This video can not be played Kim Jong-un issues his pledge for peace with South Korea In an instance, Mr Kim's confident and relaxed announcement to the press dispelled the picture of a remote, rigid, autocratic leader in favour of a normal, humanised statesman, intent on working to advance the cause of peace and national reconciliation. A cynic might see this as both a simple propaganda victory for Mr Kim, and also his attempt to lock in place the nuclear and missile advances the North has already achieved by calling for ""phasedâ¦disarmament"" - by intentionally downplaying the expectation of immediate progress while emphasising the need for step-by-step negotiations. Why has Kim halted nuclear tests now? Profile: Kim Jong-un North Korea crisis in 300 words The joint declaration echoes the themes of past accords, including the previous Korean leaders summits of 2000 and 2007, and an earlier 1991 bilateral Reconciliation and Non-Aggression agreement. Plans to establish joint liaison missions, military dialogue and confidence building measures, economic co-operation, and the expansion of contact between the citizens of the two countries have featured in earlier agreements. However, Friday's declaration is more specific in its proposals, with the two countries pledging, for example, ""to cease all hostile acts against each other in every domain, including land, sea and airâ¦"" and providing a series of key dates for the early implementation by both sides of a raft of new confidence building measures. These include the cessation of ""all hostile acts"" near the demilitarised zone by 1 May, the start of bilateral military talks in May, joint participation by the two Koreas in the 2018 Asian Games, the re-establishment of family reunions by 15 August, and, perhaps most importantly of all, a return visit to the North by President Moon by as soon as the autumn of this year. Committing to early, albeit incremental, steps in the direction of peace, appears to be motivated by the Korean leaders' wish to foster an irresistible sense of momentum and urgency. The declaration also calls for future peace treaty talks involving the two Koreas, together with one or both of China and the US. The logic of binding external actors into a definite - but evolving - timetable for progress on key issues is that it lowers the risk of conflict on the peninsula - something both Koreas are keen to avoid and which they have long had reason to fear given the past bellicose language of a ""fire and fury"" Donald Trump. Playing for time is a viable option, given that President Moon is at the start of his five-year presidency - a marked contrast to the summits of 2000 and 2007, when the respective leaders of the South, Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun, were already well into their presidential terms. Mr Moon can count, therefore, on repeat meetings with Mr Kim, and the two men appear genuinely interested in sustaining their dialogue and making progress on the wide-ranging set of initiatives included in the declaration. Mr Kim's own statements at the summit have also been a vocal argument in favour of identity politics, given his stress on ""one nation, one language, one blood"", and his repeated rejection of any future conflict between the Koreas - two themes that will have played well with a South Korean public that traditionally is sympathetic to a narrative of self-confident, although not necessarily strident, nationalism. President Trump says he will continue to exert maximum pressure on North Korea For all of the stress on Koreans determining their common future, there is no escaping the decisive importance of the US. The much anticipated Trump-Kim summit in May or early June will be critical in testing the sincerity of the North's commitment to a peaceful settlement. Pyongyang's professed commitment to ""denuclearisation"" is likely to be very different from Washington's demand for ""comprehensive, verifiable and irreversible"" nuclear disarmament. Not only will the Trump-Kim summit be a way of measuring the gap between the US and North Korea on this issue; it will also be an important opportunity to gauge how far the US has developed its own strategy for narrowing the differences with the North. Korea summit sparks cold noodle craze Diplomacy on the menu: How food can shape politics President Moon has cleverly and repeatedly allowed Mr Trump to assume credit for the breakthrough in inter-Korean relations, recognising perhaps that boosting the US president's ego is the best way of minimising the risk of war and keeping Mr Trump engaged in dialogue with the North. Whatever the long-term, substantive outcome from the Panmunjeom summit, the event has memorably showcased the political astuteness, diplomatic agility and strategic vision of both Korean leaders. The dramatic events of Friday are a reminder that personality and leadership are key ingredients in effecting historical change, sometimes allowing relatively small powers to advance their interests in spite of the competing interests of larger, more influential states.

"This video can not be played The BBC's Middle East editor Jeremy Bowen sent this report from Gaza There have been angry exchanges between Israeli and Palestinian envoys at the UN, as the diplomatic fallout over deadly violence in Gaza gathered pace. Some 58 Palestinians were killed when Israeli troops fired amid protests on Monday, with funerals held on Tuesday. The Palestinian envoy spoke of a ""crime against humanity"", while Israel accused Hamas, who are in control of Gaza, of taking their own people hostage. This week was the culmination of a six-week protest against Israel. 'Hear our message': Gaza border violence in pictures Life in the Gaza Strip Monday was the 70th anniversary of the founding of the state of Israel and also the day the US made the controversial move of its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. The emergency meeting of the UN Security Council began with its president, Poland's Joanna Wronecka, calling a minute's silence for those killed in Gaza on Monday, along with ""others who have died as a result of a conflict that has endured for far too long"". After a number of nations expressed concern at the violence and some called for an inquiry, the Palestinian and Israeli envoys engaged in a fierce exchange. Riyad Mansour speaks at the UN amid a strong difference among speakers to the council Palestinian UN envoy Riyad Mansour said: ""We condemn in the most emphatic terms the odious massacre committed by Israel in the Gaza Strip."" He called for a halt to Israel's military operations and a transparent international inquiry into what he said was a ""brutal Israeli attack on Palestinian people who expressed their resistance"". UK PM urges 'greater restraint' by Israel He said it was ""a war crime, a crime against humanity"". Mr Mansour criticised the UN for not pursuing inquiries in the past, saying: ""How many Palestinians have to die before you take action? Did they deserve to die? Did children deserve to be taken away from their parents?"" What is Hamas? What makes Jerusalem so holy? Danny Danon, the Israeli envoy to the UN, said the events at the border ""were not demonstrations, they were not protests, these were violent riots"". He said that Hamas had ""taken the people of Gaza hostage"". ""They incite people to violence, place as many civilians as possible in the line of fire to maximise civilian casualties, then they blame Israel and come to the UN to complain. It is a deadly game they play at the expense of innocent children."" He added: ""When they say day of rage they mean day of terrorism; right of return means the destruction of Israel; peaceful protest means incitement and violence."" Speaking at the UN, US ambassador Nikki Haley defended the level of Israel's use of force, saying: ""No country in this chamber would act with more restraint than Israel has."" She said the US ""deplores the loss of human life"" but laid blame on Hamas, saying: ""Make no mistake, Hamas is pleased with the results from yesterday"" Germany, the UK, Ireland and Belgium all called for an independent inquiry. UK ambassador Karen Pierce said: ""The volume of live fire used in Gaza yesterday, and the consequent number of deaths is distressing and cannot be ignored by the council"" Ireland summoned the Israeli ambassador to express its shock Turkey told Israel's ambassador to temporarily leave. Israel did the same to the Turkish consul in Jerusalem French President Emmanuel Macron told Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu in a telephone call that civilians had the right to protest peacefully Kuwait is preparing a draft document aimed it said at ""providing international protection for civilians"". This video can not be played Monday was Gaza's deadliest day of violence in years Funerals were held for the 58 Palestinians killed on Monday. About 2,700 were also injured, Palestinian officials said. Two further deaths were reported on Tuesday, but despite fears of renewed violence, calm mostly prevailed as the dead were buried. Monday and Tuesday's events came after a six-week protest called the ""Great March of Return"". Monday was the anniversary of the creation of Israel while Tuesday marks the day Palestinians call ""Nakba"", or ""catastrophe"", which commemorates the more than 700,000 Palestinians who fled or were expelled from their homes in the war which followed its foundation. Monday also marked the opening of the US embassy in Jerusalem, a move that has incensed Palestinians. Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state and see the US move as backing Israeli control over the whole of the city - which Israel regards as its indivisible capital. On Tuesday, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas recalled his envoy to Washington, Saeb Erekat, in protest at the embassy move. Did Israel use excessive force at Gaza protests? Palestinian Nakba explained in 100 and 300 words Who else is moving their embassy to Jerusalem? Analysis: The real reasons behind Trump's embassy move More than 100 protesters have been killed and thousands injured by Israeli fire during the six-week protest. By Jeremy Bowen, BBC Middle East Editor, in Gaza City This video can not be played Jeremy Bowen explains why people have been protesting in Gaza At Shifa, Gaza's main hospital, men were queuing on Tuesday to give blood. They wanted to help the many wounded in Monday's violence. Inside the hospital, there were many with gunshot wounds. Across Gaza, families were burying their dead. By midday there were no reports of new demonstrations. There was shock in Gaza at the scale of the killing. The right of return to lands they lost is a highly emotional issue for Palestinians but people here questioned whether it was worth staging such a protest after the terrible death toll. In fact, this was an incident waiting to happen. Tension has been rising for weeks in Gaza. People here have been impoverished by a goods blockade imposed by Israel and by Egypt, which shuns Hamas because of its links with the Muslim Brotherhood. The only way of stopping more violence and death is to work seriously to settle the conflict. But that is not happening. Can settlement issue be solved?

"The Farnese Blue diamond passed down through generations of royal families A rare blue diamond that has spent the past 300 years in Europe's royal houses has been sold at auction in Geneva for $6.7m (Â£5m). The Farnese Blue was given as a wedding present to Elizabeth Farnese, daughter of the Duke of Parma, when she married Philip V of Spain in 1715. It then passed down through the generations, moving from Spain to France, Italy and Austria. The 6.1 carat diamond comes from the famous Golconda mine of India. It sold after just four minutes of bidding at Sotheby's, easily passing the auction house's estimate of $3.5m-$5m. ""We were expecting a good result but we started from $3.5m and we ended up with $6.7m, so we exceeded our expectation,"" said Sotheby's jewellery specialist, Daniela Mascetti. ""Good jewels, well-designed, well-made, with a signature, with a perfect... slot in time, in age, do very well.""

"Thomas Baty (left) and Thomas Howard complained of breathing difficulties on Sunday A second British amateur rugby player has died after complaining of breathing difficulties on returning from a nightclub in Sri Lanka. Thomas Howard, 25, and Thomas Baty, 26, had been touring the country with Durham-based Clems Pirates RFC when they visited the club in Colombo. Mr Howard, from Durham, died after being admitted to hospital on Sunday. Mr Baty, also from Durham, who had been critically ill in the same hospital, has also now died. Durham City Rugby Football Club, which oversees the team, confirmed Mr Howard died after ""suffering breathing problems"". A club statement said: ""It is with great sadness that the Club can now confirm that Tom Baty has died following his admission to hospital on Sunday. ""We would like to extend our sincere condolences to the Baty family."" Mr Howard's post-mortem examination did not show any injury or illness and samples have been sent for further analysis, police said. Both players died in Colombo's Nawaloka Hospital Family members of both players are in Sri Lanka and are being assisted by UK consular staff. The team arrived in Sri Lanka on 9 May and began the tour with a game against Ceylonese Rugby and Football Club (CR & FC) in Colombo. According to police in Sri Lanka, some British players went to Colombo's Cleopatra nightclub after the match and returned to their hotel in the early hours of Sunday. The two players complained of breathing difficulties to the hotel management at about 10:00 on Sunday and were taken to Nawaloka Hospital. Police are examining CCTV from the nightclub in an effort to establish the players' movements. Tributes to the pair from other rugby clubs across the UK have been made on social media.

"Joshua Titcombe died from sepsis nine days after being born at Furness General Hospital Avoidable deaths occurred at a hospital while regulators took too long to act on concerns about midwives, a report has said. Eleven babies and one mother died at Furness General Hospital in Barrow, Cumbria, between 2004 and 2013. AProfessional Standards Authority review said,externalthe Nursing and Midwifery Council failed to react quickly enough to concerns from police and families. The NMC has apologised and admitted its approach was ""unacceptable"". Concerns at the hospital were first raised after the death of nine-day-old Joshua Titcombe in 2008 from sepsis. This prompted a highly critical government-backed report in 2015 which said a ""lethal mix"" of failures led to a number of deaths. The Professional Standards Authority (PSA) Lessons Learned review criticised the NMC for taking up to eight years to begin fitness-to-practise hearings against a number of midwives after concerns were raised. It said the delays meant midwives who were later suspended or struck off continued to practise. ""Further avoidable deaths occurred while the NMC were considering the complaints,"" the report said. ""Its handling of the cases before 2014 generally was frequently incompetent."" Midwives at Furness General Hospital were criticised over the deaths of babies and a mother No prosecutions were brought by police, but three midwives were subsequently struck off and a fourth was suspended following the deaths at the hospital. The review said it could find no evidence of the NMC acting on information it was given by Cumbria Police about 22 cases it had investigated at the hospital, which is part of the University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust. Harry Cayton, chief executive of the PSA, said the review findings ""show that the response of the NMC was inadequate"". Head of midwives' regulator to step down 'Lethal failures' led to baby deaths Midwife admits she is unfit to practise In a joint statement, Liza Brady, Carl Hendrickson and James Titcombe, who were affected by the deaths, said the report showed ""the truly shocking scale of the NMC's failure to respond properly to the serious concerns and detailed information provided to them relating to the safety of midwifery services at Furness General Hospital"". ""We were particularly horrified that even when Cumbria Police directly raised significant issues, the NMC effectively ignored the information for almost two years,"" they added. Mr Hendrickson's wife, Nittaya, and newborn son, Chester, both died at the maternity unit in 2008 after Mrs Hendrickson suffered an amniotic fluid embolism, where amniotic fluid gets into the mother's bloodstream. He told the BBC: ""I was devastated. I needed help, I needed to find out the truth. ""The NMC at no stage offered any help, never contacted me. There was certainly no empathy or compassion. ""They were just a disgrace. They were almost not human."" The organisation declined to respond directly to Mr Hendrickson's criticisms. NMC chief executive Jackie Smith has been in her post for six years Barrow and Furness MP John Woodcock said the report ""shows how local families were systematically obstructed and failed by an organisation whose conduct has brought shame on the proud and vital profession it is supposed to represent"". The review said although the NMC's performance as a regulator is improving, it needs to ""urgently review and improve"" its engagement with patients and families who register complaints and provide them with ""appropriate information"". NMC chief executive Jackie Smith, who has announced she will leave her post in July, said their approach to the deaths ""was unacceptable and I am truly sorry for this"". She said they had made ""significant changes"" since 2014 which had ""put vulnerable witnesses and families affected by failings in care at the heart of our work"". Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the NMC ""clearly still needs a massive culture change so that families feel they are being genuinely listened to and not just made part of a process"".

"This video can not be played Rachel Reeves says Carillion directors 'destroyed a British company' Carillion's board presided over a ""rotten corporate culture"" and was culpable for its ""costly collapse"", two committees of MPs have concluded. They also called for a potential break-up of the big four audit firms, after they ""waved through"" the indebted construction firm's accounts. And they attacked the government for lacking ""decisiveness and bravery"" to tackle corporate regulation failures. The MPs said regulators should consider disqualifying the directors. Carillion collapsed under a Â£1.5bn debt pile in January. It employed 43,000 people, about 20,000 of them in the UK, thousands of whom have lost their jobs. It also held numerous public contracts, such as the maintenance of schools and prisons, all of which had to be brought under government control, at a cost to the taxpayer. In a damning 100-page report, the Work and Pensions and the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy committees said: The Big Four accountancy firms were a ""cosy club incapable of providing the degree of independent challenge needed"" Carillion's collapse had exposed ""systemic flaws"" in corporate Britain and showed regulators were ""toothless"" And warned ""Carillion could happen again, and soon"" Rachel Reeves, chair of the business committee, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""The directors are culpable for the mess that Carillion got into and drove the company off a cliff."" She accused them of a ""relentless dash for cash"" by taking on low-margin contracts which didn't make money. ""And when we had the directors in front of our Select Committee, they seemed to be in total denial about what happened to their company,"" she said. In their report, the two committees called Carillion's rise and fall ""a story of recklessness, hubris and greed"". Carillion: Six charts that explain what happened Where did Carillion's problems come from? They singled out former directors Richard Adam, Richard Howson and Philip Green for particular scrutiny, saying the men had grown the firm through ill-judged acquisitions while hiding Carillion's financial problems from shareholders. They added that even as the company publicly began to unravel, the board was ""concerned with increasing and protecting generous executive bonuses"". ""Long term obligations, such as adequately funding Carillion's pension schemes, were treated with contempt,"" they said. Former Carillion chairman Philip Green at a parliamentary hearing They said the directors had presented themselves during parliamentary hearings as victims of ""unforeseeable mishaps"". But Carillion's former finance director, Richard Adam, said he rejected the committees' conclusions and objected to quotes in the MPs' report, which he said had been misattributed to him. Former chairman Philip Green said the board had ""always strived to act in the interests of the company and all its stakeholders"". The two select committees also attacked the big four accounting firms for approving Carillion's accounts despite its spiralling debts. They said Ernst & Young was paid Â£10.8m for ""six months of failed turnaround advice"" Deloitte received Â£10m to be Carillion's internal auditor, but was either ""unable or unwilling"" to identify failings in financial controls, or ""too readily ignored them"" KPMG failed to question Carillion's financial judgements while PwC continues ""to gain"" as its official receiver ""without adequate scrutiny"". Ms Reeves said the competition authorities should consider breaking up the big four accountancy firms to ""help increase competition and deal with conflicts of interest"". Carillion collapse sparks 'big four' probe Carillion pension scheme was 'ignored' But a KPMG spokesman said it had conducted its audits of Carillion ""appropriately"", and Ernst & Young said it was ""disappointed that despite all efforts the business was not rescued"". Deloitte said it was ""disappointed"" with committees' conclusions while PwC said it was helping save ""thousands of jobs"" as official receiver. Carillion delivered ""swathes"" of public services, MPs said Michael Izza, chief executive of the Institute of Chartered Accountants, told the Today programme the report felt like a watershed moment for the industry. ""It gives us an opportunity to think again about what we need to do to fix this. Because if we don't fix this I don't think we're going to have a profession in 20 years time."" The MPs also accused regulators of being too ""passive"" in tackling Carillion's problems, and said government failures had made the collapse of the outsourcing firm ""if not inevitable, then at least a distinct possibility"". They said contractors that handled ""swathes"" of public services needed to be closely monitored But they said the government had failed to spot the risks because of its ""semi-professional part-time"" system of oversight. Frank Field, chair of the Work and Pensions Committee, said: ""Government urgently needs to come to Parliament with radical reforms to our creaking system of corporate accountability."" A Cabinet Office spokeswoman said it had recently announced measures to support government suppliers, including strengthening its commitment to ""protecting staff, businesses and small suppliers from irresponsible directors"". It said it would ""respond fully"" to the committees' report in due course.

"Brexit Secretary Mike Russell told MSPs that the UK government's proposal was ""unprecedented, unequal and unacceptable"" The Scottish Parliament has refused to give its consent to the UK's main piece of Brexit legislation. The Scottish and UK governments are at odds over the EU Withdrawal Bill and what it could mean for devolved powers. Labour, Green and Lib Dem MSPs united to back SNP members in rejecting the Westminster bill, saying it would restrict Holyrood's powers. The Scottish Conservatives voted against, and have blamed the SNP for the failure to find an agreement. MSPs voted by 93 to 30 that Holyrood ""does not consent to the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill"". Westminster ultimately has the power to introduce the legislation without the consent of Holyrood - but it would be politically difficult, and has never been done before. How significant is this vote? What is the row all about anyway? Look back on the debate on Holyrood Live Speaking after the vote, Scotland's Brexit secretary, Mike Russell, urged the UK government to respect the will of the Scottish Parliament and find an acceptable solution. He said: ""The Scottish Parliament has now said overwhelmingly that this attempt to undermine devolution is unacceptable. ""The UK government cannot ignore the reality of devolution or try to drown out what this parliament says. They cannot pretend that no motion has been passed."" Both the Scottish and UK governments insist that the door is still open to finding a deal, although both sides also admit they remain some distance apart. Scottish Conservative constitution spokesman Adam Tomkins said that the UK government had already made ""radical"" changes to the bill which had resulted in the Labour government in Walesdropping its opposition to it. And he said it was ""profoundly regrettable"" that a deal had not been done between Scottish and UK ministers, saying that ""the only government that hasn't compromised is the Scottish government"". Nicola Sturgeon told BBC Scotland ahead of the vote that she still hopes a deal can be reached with the UK government The Scottish government insists this is a highly significant moment, as it is the first time the Holyrood parliament has ever refused consent to a piece of Westminster legislation which is likely to be imposed anyway, without consent. It is certainly a constitutional first - but one that can be overcome by Westminster. The UK government has the authority to simply impose the Brexit legislation on Scotland, even if that is politically problematic. It would overturn 20 years of constitutional convention and precedent. This prime minister has ignored the will of the Scottish Parliament before. This time last year itvoted in favour of a second indyrefand the PMsaid no. There was no noticeable uprising of popular outrage then. And there is unlikely to be so now. Nicola Sturgeon rarely shies away from a fight with Westminster. It's generally good politics for her to say she is ""standing up for Scotland"" against ministers in London. She hopes it helps build the case for why Scotland would be better off as an independent country. Her problem is that this argument has not caught voters' attention. The right of the Scottish Parliament to have a definitive say over regulations governing the use of pesticides does not appear to cause great concern to Scots. Some may be outraged over the principle of legislation being imposed on Scotland after it has been specifically rejected by their MSPs. The practical consequences may not amount to much. Yet it is one more headache for Theresa May in the migraine-inducing process of trying to secure a Brexit deal. Read more from Sarah Months of talks between the two governments have failed to reach an agreement The UK government has published proposals that would see the ""vast majority"" of the 158 areas where policy in devolved areas is currently decided in Brussels go directly to the Scottish and Welsh parliaments after Brexit. But it has also named 24 areas where it wants to retain power temporarily in the wake of Britain's exit from the EU, including in areas such as agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and public procurement. It says the ""temporary restriction"" on the devolved governments using some of the powers returning from the EU is needed ""to help ensure an orderly departure from EU law"" and allow the same rule and regulations to remain in place across the whole of the UK. But the Scottish government argues that it would leave Holyrood unable to pass laws in some devolved areas for up to seven years. It has produced its own alternative Brexit legislation, which was passed by MSPs in March but is currently subject to a legal challenge by the UK government. Read more here The consent vote at Holyrood is the latest step in the long-running powers row between the Scottish and UK governments During the debate, Mr Russell told MSPs that they needed to defend the progress which has been made in the 20 years of devolution in Scotland. He said: ""It is our job to ensure that it is not cast aside because of a Brexit which Scotland did not vote for and which can only be damaging to our country. ""Today the challenge of Brexit - or rather the challenge of the proposed power grab by the UK government under the guise of delivering Brexit - puts our devolved settlement at risk."" Mr Russell also told MSPs that the Withdrawal Bill would add an ""unprecedented, unequal and unacceptable new legislative constraint"", taking powers away from Holyrood for up to seven years. And he said that the consent vote ""will not be the end of this process"", as it applies only to the bill ""as it stands"". The UK government's Scottish secretary, David Mundell, said he was ""disappointed"" by the vote, but said the UK parliament remains sovereign and can proceed regardless. But he said he remained hopeful that an agreement could still be reached between the two governments. Mr Mundell said: ""It's something that was envisaged by the devolution settlement, that there might be circumstances where consent wouldn't be given. ""That circumstance would permit the Westminster government to proceed with legislation on that basis, and that's what we intend to do because the bill is already in the system. ""Obviously there'll be the opportunity for debate and discussion in parliament, but also I hope between the two governments. I still think we can resolve this issue, and that remains my objective."" A Scottish Labour amendment calling for ""cross-party talksin an attempt to broker an agreed way forward"" was accepted, and Mr Russell said he would invite UK ministers to ""hear the concerns of all parties"" and to discuss ""any new ideas"". The party's Brexit spokesman, Neil Findlay, blamed the Conservatives and their ""shambolic handling"" of Brexit for the failure to reach an agreement. Scottish Greens co-convener Patrick Harvie hailed the ""unity"" displayed by SNP, Labour, Green and Lib Dem members saying they would ""stand together in defence of the parliament"". Lib Dem Europe spokesman Tavish Scott said the negotiating governments had failed to learn from the ""ongoing farce"" of Brexit, arguing that leaving the EU was ""bad for the UK and bad for Scotland"".

Von Trier had been banned from the festival for seven yearsfor comments he made in a press conference for his sci-fi film Melancholia. The Danish film-maker pushed organisers too far when he said (as a joke it was later assumed) he was a Nazi. Now, with The House That Jack Built, the offence has gone further - into the throng of the gathered press. In one scene, as the killer Jack mutilates a girlfriend, he says: ""Why is it always the man's fault... ""If you are born male you are born to be guilty. Think of the injustice of that."" Lars von Trier (centre) and some of those involved in the The House That Jack Built attended the film's Cannes premiere There is also a scene in which he practises amateur taxidermy on one of his victims. Variety reporter Ramin Setoodeh said more than 100 people walked out of the Cannes screening. The Hollywood Reporter called the film ""an autoerotic ego massage... often as inane as it is unsettling"". It said it was a direct rebuttal ""to the current climate of reckoning over gender bias and sexual misconduct"". The film also featured images of Hitler and other mass-murdering dictators. Lars von Trier at Cannes with Melancholia's star Kirsten Dunst - before he was banned Von Trier's ban in 2011 was after he said of Hitler: ""He's not what you would call a good guy but I understand him. I sympathise with him a little bit."" The film's star Kirsten Dunst, sitting beside him at the time, alsodidn't look impressedwith the director's statement The House That Jack Built's producer told the BBC on Monday: ""It's not too bloody. Of course we have some graphic images, but they're very short and very few. It's more about the psychological side of evilness. I think there'll be a huge reaction to the film.""
