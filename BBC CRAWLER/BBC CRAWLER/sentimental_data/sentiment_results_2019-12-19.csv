"Andrew Bailey has been appointed as the next governor of the Bank of England. Mr Bailey, aged 60, is currently chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the City watchdog. He will become the 121st governor of the Bank of England on 16 March, taking over from Mark Carney, and will serve a full eight-year term. The search for the new governor began in April and Mr Bailey, who spent more than 30 years at the Bank, was seen as an early favourite for the job. Andrew Bailey's 'slow and steady' rise to power What does the Bank of England governor do? Faisal Islam: Andrew Bailey's brush with animal spirits However, the FCA has faced criticism in recent months over its regulatory scrutiny of the flagship fund of one of the UK's best known money managers, Neil Woodford. The fund was suspended in June and eventually closed, with investors expected to lose large sums of money. In addition, the FCA's report into Royal Bank of Scotland's treatment of small business by its controversial restructuring division was called a ""whitewash"" after itrecommended taking no further action against the bank. It sets the official interest rate, which determines the cost of borrowing money It supervises the financial system, seeking to ensure it is stable and no banks are running out of cash It acts as the government's bank and a lender of last resort in times of financial difficulty It issues the UK's banknotes (coins are issued by the Royal Mint) It stores the UK's gold reserves, as well as those of other central banks Announcing the decision to appoint Mr Bailey, Chancellor Sajid Javid said he was ""the stand-out candidate in a competitive field"". ""He is the right person to lead the Bank as we forge a new future outside the EU and level-up opportunity across the country,"" he added. This video can not be played What does the Bank of England governor do? The BBC's Dharshini David explains Accepting the role, Mr Bailey said it was ""a tremendous honour"" to be chosen. ""The Bank has a very important job and, as governor, I will continue the work that Mark Carney has done to ensure that it has the public interest at the heart of everything it does."" CBI chief economist Rain Newton-Smith congratulated Mr Bailey, saying:  ""His strong experience, both in Threadneedle Street and at the Financial Conduct Authority, means he is particularly well placed to steer the British economy through the new course it will take after Brexit and through challenging global economic times."" But shadow chancellor John McDonnell was critical of the appointment, saying: ""As an establishment figure with what some consider is a less than inspiring record at the FCA, Andrew Bailey will need to demonstrate early that he appreciates the need to address the deep structural problems of our economy and, like Mark Carney, understands the climate change threat."" Mr Carney had been due to step down on 31 January, but has now agreed to stay on until 15 March in order to provide for a smooth transition. Mr Carney described Mr Bailey as ""an extraordinary public servant"". ""Andrew brings unparalleled experience, built over three decades of dedicated service across all policy areas of the Bank,"" he said. Minouche Shafik was seen as an early favourite to succeed Mark Carney The decision means hopes that the Bank could have been led by a female governor for the first time in its history have been dashed. Minouche Shafik, a former member of the Bank of England's interest rate-setting committee,had been hotly tipped for the role. Mr Bailey has spent almost the entirety of his career at the Bank of England, which he joined in 1985. He has held a number of roles including chief cashier, which meant that his signature appeared on all bank notes issued by the Bank of England. Mr Bailey was chief cashier during the financial crisis when,he recalled in an interview,external: ""The [RBS] treasurer, John Cummins, came in and I thought he was going to have a heart attack... and he looked at me and said: 'I need Â£25bn today, can you do it?'. I said: 'Yes, I can do that'."" Mr Bailey was also a deputy governor and head of the Bank's prudential regulation division, before joining the FCA as its chief executive in 2016. Andrew Bailey was the early frontrunner for one of the most powerful positions in the UK. However, his time as head of the City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority, was peppered with a number of high-profile controversies - including its handling of complaints intoRBS's treatment of small businesses in the aftermath of the financial crisis- which many thought might have harmed his chances for the top job. He is highly thought of by colleagues and civil servants. Former Permanent Treasury Secretary Lord McPherson described him as the most able and competent Bank of England official he had ever worked with, adding that while Bailey would not make waves for the government he had the backbone to stand up to it. Mr Bailey, who will be paid Â£495,000 a year, is taking over at a fraught time for the Bank of England. It emerged this week that an audio feed of sensitive market information from the Bank had been leaked to fund managers. The Bank admitted one of its suppliers had ""misused"" the feed which gave traders early access to information that could potentially generate large sums of money. The matter has been referred to the FCA, which Mr Bailey currently leads. The City watchdog said it was ""looking at the issue"". PA reported that the prime minister's official spokesman, when asked whether Brexit was a factor in Mr Bailey's appointment, said: ""The way it works is the chancellor recommends candidates to the PM, the PM then advises the Queen."" When pressed on the issue, the spokesman added:  ""I just went through the process and the prime minister thinks he will do an excellent job.""

"A woman who lost her job after saying that people cannot change their biological sex has lost an employment tribunal. Maya Forstater, 45, did not have her contract renewed after posting a series of tweets questioning government plans to let people declare their own gender. Ms Forstater believes trans women holding certificates that recognise their transgender identity cannot describe themselves as women. But that view is ""not worthy of respect in a democratic society"", a judge said. Gender passport rules 'unlawful', court hears Ms Forstater, who had worked as a tax expert at the think tank Center for Global Development, was not entitled to ignore the rights of a transgender person and the ""enormous pain that can be caused by misgendering"", employment judge James Tayler said. Ms Forstater was ""absolutist"" in her view,he concluded in a 26-page judgement,external. ""It is a core component of her belief that she will refer to a person by the sex she considered appropriate even if it violates their dignity and/or creates an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment,"" he continued. ""The approach is not worthy of respect in a democratic society."" Ms Forstater had argued ""framing the question of transgender inclusion as an argument that male people should be allowed into women's spaces discounts women's rights to privacy and is fundamentally illiberal (it is like forcing Jewish people to eat pork)"".

"Magdalena Lesicka and Peter Chilvers had been in a relationship since 2010 A woman stabbed her 23-month-old son to death following a mental breakdown triggered by her controlling pilot boyfriend, a court has heard. Ryanair pilot Peter Chilvers repeatedly threatened to kill Magda Lesicka, 33, before she attacked their son, James, at her home in Wythenshawe in 2017. She was jailed for 15 years last year after pleading guilty to manslaughter. Chilvers, 33, has now been jailed for 18 months after being convicted of controlling or coercive behaviour. Manchester Crown Court heard Lesicka, who met Chilvers while also working for the airline, was sentenced on the basis her mental illness emerged suddenly and without any warning, and she had no memory of committing the offence on 26 August 2017. The couple had been in a relationship since 2010 but Chilvers cheated on Lesicka from 2014 with another cabin crew member, jurors heard. Chilvers, from Northwich, Cheshire, warned Lesicka in a ""visceral"" phone call, which was played in court, that she did not have the financial resources to win a custody battle. He had repeatedly threatened to kill her if she removed James from his care and demanded they continue to live together at a new home in the Cheshire village of Wincham. In the days before the killing, Lesicka made internet searches about ""killing in self defence"" and contacted domestic abuse charity Women's Aid, the court heard. The Crown accepted her defence that she killed James following a breakdown induced by the ""deliberate, relentless and ultimately overwhelming psychological torment"" inflicted by Chilvers who had portrayed a ""landscape of unending misery if she did not comply with his demands"". James Chilvers was killed at Magda Lesicka's home in Beaford Road, Wythenshawe, in August 2017 Chilvers' controlling or coercive behaviour, between December 2015 and August 2017, included using or threatening physical violence, forcing her into degrading sexual acts, isolating her from her friends and restricting her finances. As part of the evidence, the court heard a 33-minute phone call made by Chilvers on the morning of 26 August to Lesicka - before the killing - in which at times he screamed profanities at her. Rob Hall, prosecuting, said such behaviour confirmed his ""bullying, controlling, self-centred nature"". Lesicka, a Polish national, was jailed in July last year after pleading guilty to manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility. At her sentencing hearing at Preston Crown Court, Mr Justice Dove said James was ""dearly loved and cherished"" by those around him and had been ""caught as a tragic innocent victim between two warring parents"". ""Whatever the rights and wrongs of that dispute, the last thing that should have happened is he lose his life - killed by a parent,"" he said. James's grandmother, Hilary Chilvers, read out her victim personal statement in court and described her grandson as being ""full of potential and promise"". ""We have all been deprived of James's presence in our life,"" she said. ""He was adorable, beautiful, inquisitive and loving."" Lesicka gave evidence in the prosecution of Chilvers, of Hewitt Grove, and parts of her victim personal statement composed in prison were read out. ""It's hard to see myself as a victim given the tragic outcome. I know my life has been changed forever and there is nothing I can do change it back,"" the statement said. ""When I started a relationship with Peter Chilvers I had absolutely no idea he would be the controlling monster I discovered him to be. ""It is important that the public understand what Peter Chilvers' abuse did to me. It destroyed me."" Mark Ford QC, defending, said character references for Chilvers provided to the court painted a ""very different picture"" to that given by Lesicka. He said his partner Lisa Spencer had attested to a supportive, co-operative and loving relationship with him.

"None of the original members of the breakaway group remains an MP The Independent Group for Change is being disbanded after failing to win any seats at the general election, leader Anna Soubry has said. The party was founded last March by Labour and Tory MPs unhappy with the direction their parties were going in. The 11 MPs aimed to create a new centre ground force in politics. But some left to join the Lib Dems, quit politics or run as independents, and the remaining three lost to candidates from their former parties. Eight Labour MPs left the party to form the breakaway group, citing Labour's Brexit policy and record on tackling anti-Semitism. They were later joined by three Remain-supporting Conservative MPs, Anna Soubry, Sarah Wollaston and Heidi Allen. Dr Wollaston later joined the Lib Dems - and lost her seat to a Tory candidate last Thursday - and Ms Allen did not stand for re-election. The party that didn't quite change UK politics Former Labour MPs Chuka Umunna and Luciana Berger stood as Liberal Democrat candidates but were also defeated in last Thursday's election. Independent Group for Change leader Ms Soubry came adistant third in Broxtowe,external, which was won by the Conservative candidate. Former Labour MPs Chris Leslie and Mike Gapes, who stood as Independent Group for Change candidates, also lost their seats. Gavin Shuker, who quit Labour to join Change UK before deciding to run as an independent in the Luton South poll, also failed to be elected. Earlier on Thursday, the group, which was briefly known as Change UK, tweeted: ""We came together & took a stand when others wouldn't. ""It was right to shine a spotlight on Britain's broken politics. But having taken stock and with no voice now in Parliament, we begin the process of winding up our party. Thanks to all who stood with us."" In a statement to members, Ms Soubry said the party's failure to make an impact at May's European elections, and the subsequent defection or retirement of most of its MPs, made it ""harder for us to cut through as a distinctive political force in our own right"". But, she added, ""we nevertheless believed it was important for us to have the courage of our convictions and to stand in the general election so that our constituents would have a full choice"". ""Whilst there is clearly a need for massive change in British politics,"" Ms Soubry went on, ""now that we no longer have voices within Parliament, a longer-term realignment will have to take place in a different way. ""Honesty and realism are at the core of our values, and we therefore must recognise that the political uncertainty of recent months has now given way to a settled pattern in Parliament for the next five years. So this is the right time for us to take stock.""

"The Cap of Maintenance and the Sword of State precede the Queen into the House of Lords chamber It may have been billed as a less ornate affair than usual, but even a dressed-down State Opening of Parliament is hard to mistake for a casual do. The twinkling of the tiaras and clip-clop of horses' hooves were gone, as the Queen swapped her traditional horse-drawn carriage for a Bentley. But with the glittering gold throne and bejewelled crown sitting on a velvet cushion, there was still more than enough pomp to go round. The Queen normally arrives by horse-drawn carriage This time she travelled the short journey to Parliament by Bentley The day begins in the gentle drizzle outside Parliament, as patient police officers redirect irate commuters around the cordoned-off streets, while sleek BMWs and Jaguars with personalised number plates and national flags affixed to the bonnets transport diplomats to the building. The foreign dignitaries pack out their small section of the House of Lords - a contrast to the ample elbow room available to peers on the rest of the red benches. Live: Reaction to the Queen's Speech Brexit and NHS dominate government agenda What is the Queen's Speech and why is it important? Five big things on Boris Johnson's to-do list Perhaps the relatively sparse attendance is not surprising - it is, after all, only two months since the last Queen's Speech. On that occasion, the Queen read out the list of her government's priorities - but it was far from clear if any of the proposed laws would be passed by such a divided Parliament. Things are very different now. After last Thursday's general election, the government has a healthy majority of 80 and is likely to have no trouble getting its policies into law. The Queen is accompanied by her son Prince Charles, who sits on an imperceptibly smaller throne The snap general election meant less time to prepare for the ceremony and, therefore, certain elements were dropped - the Queen wore a day dress instead of sparkly court dress and tiara. The 93-year-old monarchno longer wears the heavy, jewel-encrustedImperial State Crown for state openings, describing it in a documentary last year as ""unwieldy"". She also arrived by car rather than horse and carriage - a sort of Cinderella in reverse. Despite these changes, the event, which can be traced back to the 16th Century and marks the formal start of the Parliamentary year, is still governed by tradition, and there is certainly nothing casual about the House of Lords chamber. Stained glass windows line the walls, ancient coats of arms hang below the balcony, while the golden throne wouldn't look out of place in a fairy tale castle or a Donald Trump hotel. The bright crimson robes trimmed with snow white ermine, worn by members of the House of Lords, gives the whole place a Christmassy feel, like a Santa Claus convention - appropriate for a rare December Queen's Speech. Watching the speech from the gloom of the upper gallery of the House of Lords The grandeur of the lower part of the Lords chamber distracts from the comparatively drab upper half, where the dark statues of those lords who signed the Magna Carta, hands resting on their swords, are just about visible through the gloom. For the Queen, it must be a slightly strange experience to read out a speech setting out your government's priorities beneath the stern gaze of those men who demanded the monarch of the day - King John - share more of his powers with them. Nevertheless, Her Majesty is treated with absolute reverence as she enters the chamber. The audience rises and only sits down again when the Queen grants permission. There is total silence as she sits awaiting the arrival of the MPs. A sign outside the Strangers' Gallery - ""all demonstrations are out of order and will be treated accordingly"" - offers an ominously vague warning to would-be hecklers. Black Rod Sarah Clarke, Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle and Serjeant at Arms Ugbana Oyet As the elected politicians - from both the victorious party and those that were defeated - arrive in the chamber, the Queen begins her eponymous speech. After weeks of hearing politicians passionately repeat their election pledges in the hurly burly of the campaign trail, it feels strange to hear those same phrases filtered through the clipped, neutral tones of the monarch to a solemn, respectful audience. She concludes her speech, picks up her black handbag and heads for the exit. And with that Parliament is officially opened, the tricky business of getting to power is over, the even-trickier business of governing begins.

"King Charles has delivered the Labour government's first King's Speech in the House of Lords. Part of the State Opening of Parliament ceremony, the speech marks the start of the parliamentary year. The King's Speech set out the new Labour government's priorities for the months ahead, following the party's general election victory. Formally called the Speech from the Throne, Charles gavehis first King's Speech in November 2023. He also delivered the Queen's Speech on behalf of his mother, the late Queen Elizabeth, in May 2022. The quirks and crowns of the King's State Opening The speech is written by the government, and the monarch delivers it in a neutral tone, to avoid any appearance of political support. Its length depends on the number of proposed laws and other announcements - such as foreign policy objectives - but it normally lasts about 10 minutes. The 2024 Kings Speech outlined the draft laws which Labour plan to introduce in the coming months. These include bills on workers' rights, the renationalisation of the railways, illegal immigration, housing and planning and House of Lords reform. Key points in King's Speech at a glance Traditionally, the State Opening begins with a procession in which the King travels from Buckingham Palace to Westminster by carriage. On arrival, he uses the Sovereign's Entrance, reserved for the monarch. The King then processes to the throne in the House of Lords. MPs are summoned to the Lords by Black Rod,an official position currently held by Sarah Clarke,external. Before entering the House of Commons, Black Rod has the door shut in their face. They then have to knock three times on the door with the rod to gain entry before it is opened, and MPs follow Black Rod back to the House of Lords to hear the speech. MPs, peers and other dignitaries generally listen in silence. Traditionally, the government MP holding the position ofvice-chamberlain of the household,external- currently Samantha Dixon - is ""held hostage"" in Buckingham Palace while the King is in Parliament, to ensure the monarch's safe return. Who is Black Rod and what do they do in Parliament? What does the King do? Yes. About two hours after the speech is delivered, MPs reassemble in the House of Commons to begin debating its contents. After introductory speeches by two MPs, the prime minister will ""sell"" the speech to the Commons, setting out a vision for the country. The leader of the opposition then gets the chance to respond, before other MPs are allowed to contribute. The last prime minister to lose a vote on the speech was Stanley Baldwin in 1924 The debate on what is known as ""the Humble Address"" normally lasts about five days. At the end of the debate there is a vote. It is normally seen as symbolic, as it is extremely rare for a government to lose it. The last time this happened was in January 1924, under Conservative Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin. Mr Baldwin proceeded with a King's Speech - George V was the monarch at the time - despite having lost his majority in the previous month's general election. He was forced to resign, and Labour formed a short-lived government. The speech outlined21 laws that ministers had intended to pass in the 2023 Parliamentary session. They included plans to boost investment in transport, laws to stop people smoking, and tougher sentences for serious offenders. However, when former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced the 4 July general election, the government was forced to abandon many of its planned bills. Which laws were passed in final days of the previous Parliament?

"Magdalena Lesicka and Peter Chilvers had been in a relationship since 2010 A woman stabbed her 23-month-old son to death following a mental breakdown triggered by her controlling pilot boyfriend, a court has heard. Ryanair pilot Peter Chilvers repeatedly threatened to kill Magda Lesicka, 33, before she attacked their son, James, at her home in Wythenshawe in 2017. She was jailed for 15 years last year after pleading guilty to manslaughter. Chilvers, 33, has now been jailed for 18 months after being convicted of controlling or coercive behaviour. Manchester Crown Court heard Lesicka, who met Chilvers while also working for the airline, was sentenced on the basis her mental illness emerged suddenly and without any warning, and she had no memory of committing the offence on 26 August 2017. The couple had been in a relationship since 2010 but Chilvers cheated on Lesicka from 2014 with another cabin crew member, jurors heard. Chilvers, from Northwich, Cheshire, warned Lesicka in a ""visceral"" phone call, which was played in court, that she did not have the financial resources to win a custody battle. He had repeatedly threatened to kill her if she removed James from his care and demanded they continue to live together at a new home in the Cheshire village of Wincham. In the days before the killing, Lesicka made internet searches about ""killing in self defence"" and contacted domestic abuse charity Women's Aid, the court heard. The Crown accepted her defence that she killed James following a breakdown induced by the ""deliberate, relentless and ultimately overwhelming psychological torment"" inflicted by Chilvers who had portrayed a ""landscape of unending misery if she did not comply with his demands"". James Chilvers was killed at Magda Lesicka's home in Beaford Road, Wythenshawe, in August 2017 Chilvers' controlling or coercive behaviour, between December 2015 and August 2017, included using or threatening physical violence, forcing her into degrading sexual acts, isolating her from her friends and restricting her finances. As part of the evidence, the court heard a 33-minute phone call made by Chilvers on the morning of 26 August to Lesicka - before the killing - in which at times he screamed profanities at her. Rob Hall, prosecuting, said such behaviour confirmed his ""bullying, controlling, self-centred nature"". Lesicka, a Polish national, was jailed in July last year after pleading guilty to manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility. At her sentencing hearing at Preston Crown Court, Mr Justice Dove said James was ""dearly loved and cherished"" by those around him and had been ""caught as a tragic innocent victim between two warring parents"". ""Whatever the rights and wrongs of that dispute, the last thing that should have happened is he lose his life - killed by a parent,"" he said. James's grandmother, Hilary Chilvers, read out her victim personal statement in court and described her grandson as being ""full of potential and promise"". ""We have all been deprived of James's presence in our life,"" she said. ""He was adorable, beautiful, inquisitive and loving."" Lesicka gave evidence in the prosecution of Chilvers, of Hewitt Grove, and parts of her victim personal statement composed in prison were read out. ""It's hard to see myself as a victim given the tragic outcome. I know my life has been changed forever and there is nothing I can do change it back,"" the statement said. ""When I started a relationship with Peter Chilvers I had absolutely no idea he would be the controlling monster I discovered him to be. ""It is important that the public understand what Peter Chilvers' abuse did to me. It destroyed me."" Mark Ford QC, defending, said character references for Chilvers provided to the court painted a ""very different picture"" to that given by Lesicka. He said his partner Lisa Spencer had attested to a supportive, co-operative and loving relationship with him.

"The government has laid out its legislative plans for the year in the Queen's Speech. From Brexit to health, trade to the environment, it gives us a sense of what politicians will be debating over the next few months. Our experts analyse what was, and wasn't, said and what it all means for you. As well as the withdrawal agreement bill, which will pave the way for the UK's departure from the EU on 31 January, the government will have to pass a series of bills next year in other policy areas as a direct result of Brexit. Some of them will be major undertakings: a new way to run agriculture, to replace membership of the Common Agricultural Policy a fisheries bill to replace the Common Fisheries policy and turn the UK into an independent coastal state a new immigration system which will treat EU citizens the same as people from elsewhere in the world, once the policy of free movement comes to an end. There will also be bills covering trade, financial services and cross-border legal disputes. But passing legislation will be the easy bit - implementing it all will be the big challenge. New systems will need to be up and running by the end of the post-Brexit transition period in just over a year's time, new staff will have to be trained, and businesses and consumers will have to be ready too. Civil servants will be under enormous pressure to deliver everything that is required under the tight timetable the government has imposed. The Ministry of Justice and the Home Office will be among the busiest departments under Boris Johnson's new administration - a reflection of the importance he attaches to law and order. A number of measures, including those relating to domestic abuse, victims and policing, have been put forward before, but there are also new proposals on sentencing which could lead to a significant increase in the prison population among those jailed for violence, sexual assault and terrorism. Plans to extend the use of ""whole-life"" tariffs, where offenders can be ordered to spend the rest of their lives behind bars, are vaguely worded, indicating ministers are open-minded about the range of crimes for which offenders should be locked away for ever. The idea which has the most potential to alter the criminal justice landscape is for a Royal Commission to examine the process from arrest to sentence. The last time there was such a review was in 1991. The terms of reference and the chairperson have not been announced - they will be key to understanding which destination the government wishes the commission to steer towards.  Interesting times lie ahead. Environmentalists have welcomed many of the provisions of the new environment bill. But they point out that ministers are still committed to North Sea drilling, building roads that experts say will generate traffic, and blocking onshore wind power. They have stayed silent on aviation expansion, and have imposed a moratorium on fracking, rather than the permanent ban which some in the north of England were demanding. Critics point out that the planned new green watchdog won't have the sort of powers to take legal action that prompted the UK to improve air quality under the threat of fines. Action on business rates was billed as a measure to ""keep town centres vibrant"" - but what's on the table for now will only bring limited relief. Business groups have long been calling for a revamp of the rates system, which raises more than Â£31bn for the government each year. A quarter of that burden falls on retailers, who pay regardless of profit, says the British Retail Consortium. So a one-year extension of a discount for some retailers and an extension of the scheme to pubs, music venues and cinemas - with a saving of Â£320m - may feel tokenistic. This is especially so as thecancellation of planned corporation tax rate cutsmeans that business across the country will have to fork out Â£3.2bn more in bills next year than envisaged prior to the election, rising to more than Â£6bn by 2024. For greater relief, retailers will be looking ahead to the Budget and the much-touted overhaul of the rates system. However, it is questionable whether the government will be able to afford to relinquish much of what's become a key revenue raiser. Meanwhile, both business and the public sector will have to grapple with the government's plans to raise the national living wage to two-thirds median earnings by 2025 (projected to be Â£10.50), and lower the eligible age for the main rate. While the plans would in theory benefit more than four million people, alleviating in-work poverty, they have been given a cautious welcome by business groups and low-pay campaigners alike, who urge careful implementation and monitoring. While the increase in minimum wage to date hasn't had an impact on employment growth, these plans go into uncharted waters - at a time when there are already signs that the hiring spree of recent years is levelling off. Schools in England are promised more funding, rising by Â£7.1bn by 2022-23, which the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank says will reverse the budget cuts of the austerity years. Minimum levels of per pupil spending are increasing to Â£5,000 in secondary and Â£3,750 in primary schools, and then Â£4,000 in the following year. Most schools already get significantly more than this - for instance, the average for secondary schools is currently about Â£6,200 per year and Â£5,000 in primary. Only about one in five primary schools and a third of secondary schools are below the proposed new minimum, with the biggest number of these in the South East and South West and the lowest number in London. But the overall increase should mean an uplift across schools which have been complaining loudly about funding shortages. So far there is no decision on whether to cut university tuition fees, other than a promise of ""better value"" for students. The future of the NHS in England has been put front and centre of the Queen's Speech. This is understandable given that, behind the scenes, ministers and advisers are saying there has to be an improvement in English NHS performance for the government to keep hold of the voters that backed it at the election. Ministers are making big play of the extra funding, but experts within the health service have warned even with the above-inflation sums going in, it will take years to turn the NHS around and get it back to where it was a decade ago in terms of waiting times and performance - perhaps even a decade. The idea of enshrining into law the multi-year NHS funding settlement sounds more significant than it actually is. Ministers want to put a law in place compelling them to keep to their promises, but it makes little difference in reality. There are also measures promising to make it easier to recruit doctors from abroad, and the government knows it faces a tough task filling the vacancy rates and growing the workforce. There is little detail about social care - despite Boris Johnson's promise to fix the ""crisis"" in the system in his first speech as PM. Instead, he wants to seek cross-party agreement on the way forward - something that is unlikely to happen quickly, given both Labour and the Liberal Democrats have been plunged into leadership races following the election. Read more from Nick here. There are no big surprises in the busy environmental agenda outlined by the government. The headline commitment to reduce the UK's carbon emissions to ""net zero"" by 2050 is there, as are the key elements of an environment bill and new measures on animal welfare. Left unspecified, so far, are the details of many of the initiatives. A plan to increase the power of local authorities to tackle air pollution makes no mention of whether there's new money to go with it (which is what many councils have been clamouring for). Campaign promises of new cash for flood defences, electric vehicles, and energy efficiency in homes, schools and hospitals are repeated - a key test will be how they are delivered. Opposition parties are already saying the government is failing to take the radical action needed. For ministers, here's a moment of intense scrutiny on the horizon - COP26, the massive UN climate summit planned for Glasgow next November, when the eyes of the world will judge the sincerity of the UK's green ambitions. The government has announced the first Royal Commission on the criminal justice system since 1991. The last one met 44 times, took evidence from more than 600 organisations and groups, commissioned 22 research studies and lasted for more than two years. It was part of a response to the miscarriage of justice cases, which included the Guildford Four and Birmingham Six and led to the establishment of Criminal Cases Review Commission, which investigates miscarriage of justice cases. These are different times. Many will welcome the new commission addressing the problems of what is widely seen to be a criminal justice system under extreme stress, if not in crisis. Much of the blame for that is put down to swingeing cuts to the police and Crown Prosecution Service, as well as modern-day challenges such as getting on top of vast amounts of digital evidence obtained from mobile devices. However, there is real fear that the commission could be a way of kicking immediate and solvable problems into the long grass and delaying across the board investment, which many lawyers see as critical to improving a complex system in its entirety.

"Mark De Kretser said he faced 'relentless' racism during his time serving in the armed forces ""Racism is prevalent"" within the armed forces, the independent ombudsman overseeing complaints has warned. In an exclusive interview with the BBC, Nicola Williams, the first person to hold the office of Service Complaints Ombudsman, said ""incidents of racism are occurring with increasing and depressing frequency"". She urged the Ministry of Defence (MoD) to do more to root it out. The MoD has insisted it has a range of measures in place to tackle racism. Cases of bullying, harassment and discrimination account for 25% of all the complaints the armed forces receive, and Ms Williams says a ""disproportionate"" number of those come from ethnic minorities who make up just 7% of service personnel. The BBC has interviewed one former soldier whose complaint of racism was at first dismissed by the Ministry of Defence, but then upheld by the Ombudsman. The 'changing face' of the British Army Paratroopers win barracks racial harassment claim Complaints by female and BAME military staff a 'serious concern' Mark De Kretser, whose father came from Sri Lanka, served as a regular soldier and then as a reserve for nearly 30 years. He did tours of both Iraq and Afghanistan. But it wasn't combat which left him with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, it was racism. This video can not be played Former soldier Mark de Kretser: ""People called me Apu from The Simpsons"" He describes it as ""relentless"". He says he was asked whether someone in his family ran a corner shop. ""I'd be referred to as Apu, out of the Simpsons, I'd be referred to as Gary Coleman, Buddhaâ¦ and there's a common theme to all of them. ""It got to the point where I wasn't worried about how I performed at work. I was worried about what was going to be said to me next"". Mark had a breakdown and was medically discharged from the Army in 2017. He sued the MoD and has now received a financial settlement. His solicitor, Ahmed Al-Nahhas, the head of military claims at Bolt Burdon Kemp, says he sees many more servicemen and women who ask about their legal rights, but who don't make a formal complaint ""because they're afraid for their careers or they don't have faith in the system"". His point was reinforced in areport by MPs earlier this yearwhich expressed ""concern"" that pressure had been put on some complainants not to proceed. That lack of trust in the system was highlighted earlier this year when two former paratroopers took their complaint of racism to an employment tribunal instead. Hani Gue (L) and Nkululeko Zulu claimed they were subjected to racial harassment The court found that Hani Gue and Nkululeko Zulu has been working in a""degrading, humiliating and offensive environment""at their Colchester barracks with racist graffiti written across personal photos. Mr Nkululeko said he believed the army suffered from ""systemic racism"". Nicola Williams says she ""would not go as far"" as to describe the army as ""institutionally racist"". But she adds ""I would absolutely say the Army and the armed forces have issues with racism which need to be tackled"". Despite improvements she says the complaints system is still not operating efficiently and fairly. Her office is still short staffed. She's still waiting for the MoD to follow up on a number of her recommendations. Nicola Williams said the armed forces have racism issues they must tackle Ms Williams has repeatedly called on the MoD to commission an independent report to find out why so many people with BAME backgrounds and women are making complaints. The MoD insists it's committed to stamping out racism. It says it has a range of measures to ensure the issue is tackled including regular diversity and inclusion training. The Army has also set up a unit and a help-line to deal with ""unacceptable behaviours"". Lt. Colonel Jonathan Buxton , who runs the unit, says the fact the Army has invested in his team of six shows ""it is taking the problem seriously"". In a statement the MoD said ""racism has no place in the military and anyone found to be behaving in such a way can expect to be disciplined, discharged or dismissed"". Solicitor Ahmed Al-Nahhas says he's seen no evidence that any action was taken against those responsible for bullying Mark De Kretser. As for Mark himself, he's still trying to put his life back together. He says the Army ""broke me. I was really quite a strong character.

Minimum levels of per pupil spending are increasing to Â£5,000 in secondary and Â£3,750 in primary schools, and then Â£4,000 in the following year. Most schools already get significantly more than this - for instance, the average for secondary schools is currently about Â£6,200 per year and Â£5,000 in primary. Only about one in five primary schools and a third of secondary schools are below the proposed new minimum, with the biggest number of these in the South East and South West and the lowest number in London. But the overall increase should mean an uplift across schools which have been complaining loudly about funding shortages. So far there is no decision on whether to cut university tuition fees, other than a promise of ""better value"" for students. The future of the NHS in England has been put front and centre of the Queen's Speech. This is understandable given that, behind the scenes, ministers and advisers are saying there has to be an improvement in English NHS performance for the government to keep hold of the voters that backed it at the election. Ministers are making big play of the extra funding, but experts within the health service have warned even with the above-inflation sums going in, it will take years to turn the NHS around and get it back to where it was a decade ago in terms of waiting times and performance - perhaps even a decade. The idea of enshrining into law the multi-year NHS funding settlement sounds more significant than it actually is. Ministers want to put a law in place compelling them to keep to their promises, but it makes little difference in reality. There are also measures promising to make it easier to recruit doctors from abroad, and the government knows it faces a tough task filling the vacancy rates and growing the workforce. There is little detail about social care - despite Boris Johnson's promise to fix the ""crisis"" in the system in his first speech as PM. Instead, he wants to seek cross-party agreement on the way forward - something that is unlikely to happen quickly, given both Labour and the Liberal Democrats have been plunged into leadership races following the election. Read more from Nick here. There are no big surprises in the busy environmental agenda outlined by the government. The headline commitment to reduce the UK's carbon emissions to ""net zero"" by 2050 is there, as are the key elements of an environment bill and new measures on animal welfare. Left unspecified, so far, are the details of many of the initiatives. A plan to increase the power of local authorities to tackle air pollution makes no mention of whether there's new money to go with it (which is what many councils have been clamouring for). Campaign promises of new cash for flood defences, electric vehicles, and energy efficiency in homes, schools and hospitals are repeated - a key test will be how they are delivered. Opposition parties are already saying the government is failing to take the radical action needed. For ministers, here's a moment of intense scrutiny on the horizon - COP26, the massive UN climate summit planned for Glasgow next November, when the eyes of the world will judge the sincerity of the UK's green ambitions. The government has announced the first Royal Commission on the criminal justice system since 1991. The last one met 44 times, took evidence from more than 600 organisations and groups, commissioned 22 research studies and lasted for more than two years. It was part of a response to the miscarriage of justice cases, which included the Guildford Four and Birmingham Six and led to the establishment of Criminal Cases Review Commission, which investigates miscarriage of justice cases. These are different times. Many will welcome the new commission addressing the problems of what is widely seen to be a criminal justice system under extreme stress, if not in crisis. Much of the blame for that is put down to swingeing cuts to the police and Crown Prosecution Service, as well as modern-day challenges such as getting on top of vast amounts of digital evidence obtained from mobile devices. However, there is real fear that the commission could be a way of kicking immediate and solvable problems into the long grass and delaying across the board investment, which many lawyers see as critical to improving a complex system in its entirety.

"This video can not be played Queen's Speech: Brexit, the NHS and what happened next Boris Johnson has claimed his programme for government is the ""most radical Queen's Speech in a generation"". The prime minister said planned new laws to toughen up criminal justice and increase NHS spending would deliver on the ""people's priorities"". But his main priority is the UK's exit from the EU on 31 January. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said many of the PM's promises mimicked the ""language of Labour policy but without the substance"". ""They say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, even when it's a very pale imitation, but I fear those swayed by the prime minister's promises will be sorely disappointed,"" added the Labour leader. And SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford accused the PM of ""denying [Scotland] the right to choose our own future"" referring to the SNP's desire for another referendum on Scottish independence. ""Why did democracy stop in the prime minister's world with the independence referendum in 2014?"" he asked. But Boris Johnson said he felt a ""colossal sense of obligation"" to the voters. He told MPs that ""a new golden age for this United Kingdom is now within reach"" adding that the government would ""work flat out to deliver it"". LIVE: Reaction to State Opening of Parliament What does the Queen's Speech mean for you? What is the Queen's Speech and why is it important? Addressing Parliament for the second time in less than three months, the Queen said the priority for her government was to deliver Brexit on 31 January, but ministers also had an ""ambitious programme of domestic reform that delivers on the people's priorities"". Of the more than 30 bills announced in the Queen's Speech, seven were on Brexit. This video can not be played Queen's speech outlines plans for Brexit and NHS It comes as the government says it will close its Department for Exiting the European Union on 31 January. The seven bills announced that were devoted to Brexit cover legislation on trade, agriculture, fisheries, immigration, financial services and private international law. The first to be put to Parliament will be the Withdrawal Agreement Bill - the legislation that enables the UK to leave the EU - on Friday before the Christmas recess. Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn walked to the House of Lords together in silence Following last week's general election, the prime minister has a Commons majority of 80 - the largest enjoyed by a Conservative leader since Margaret Thatcher in 1987. Five big things on Boris Johnson's to-do list What is in Boris Johnson's Brexit deal? The prime minister's increased parliamentary authority and command of his party means it is likely to pass without major changes in the New Year in time to meet the 31 January deadline. In another move welcomed by Tory MPs, the bill willalso enable more British judgesto depart from previous rulings of the EU's top court. On the NHS, the government says it will enshrine in law a commitment on the health service's funding, with an extra Â£33.9bn per year provided by 2023/24. The PM's commitment on the NHS amounts to a 3.4% year-on-year increase in expenditure, a significant increase on what the NHS received during the five year Tory-Lib Dem coalition government as well as under his predecessors David Cameron and Theresa May. But it is significantly lower than the 6% average annual increases seen under Labour leaders Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. And when adjusted for inflation, and factoring in the increased cost of equipment, medicines and staff pay, it could actually be worth Â£20.5bn by 2023-4. The Tories' environmental plans analysed Do the Tories' broadband plans add up? Why do prisoners only serve half their sentence? Labour's health spokesman Jonathan Ashworth said: ""If the Conservatives' plans to put funding increases into law is to be anything other than an empty gimmick, we would urge them to pledge the extra Â£6bn a year which experts say is needed to start to make up the cuts they've imposed for a decade."" There was also a commitment announced for ministers to seek cross-party consensus for long-term reform of the social care system and the government will continue work to reform the Mental Health Act. This government wants to try to give the appearance that they are completely new, completely different, even though the Conservatives have been in power for nearly a full decade. That is quite a political stunt to try to pull off. But it's clear also that Boris Johnson came to the Commons today to present a vision that he hopes can straddle left and right, or what has traditionally been seen as Labour's place in politics and the Conservatives' place in politics. That is what the results of the general election gave him as an opportunity. And the challenge for Boris Johnson is not just to hold onto that for five years, but show to people who voted Tory for the first time that the party was worth the risk - that their vote was the right decision. The test will be enormous - whether or not all that rhetoric actually matches up to the reality of the actions and decisions that this government will make. Mr Johnson has had a reputation for years of being hungry with ambition to get to this place. We're going to find out in the next months and years whether he's hungry to take the decisions that actually will cement his place in history. Plans for longer sentences for violent criminals, were also unveiled, as well as the establishment of a Royal Commission to improve the ""efficiency and effectiveness"" of the criminal justice process and there are bills that will ensure the most serious violent offenders serve longer prison terms. And those charged with knife possession will face ""swift justice"". Other announcements in the Queen's Speech included: A ""points-based immigration system"", allowing the UK to welcome skilled workers On housing, landlords will get more rights to gain possession of their property and a new ""lifetime deposit"" scheme has been proposed which will mean tenants do not have to find a new deposit every time they move A pledge to cut business rates for thousands of retailers, pubs and restaurants across England and Wales. With the aim of helping struggling high streets, the government promised to increase the retail discount on rates by a third to 50%, costing Â£320m A new visa to ""ensure qualified doctors, nurses and health professionals have fast-track entry to the United Kingdom"" The removal of hospital car parking charges ""for those in greatest need"" New laws to ""accelerate the delivery of gigabit capable broadband"" The government will continue to take steps to meet net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 Work will be taken forward to repeal the Fixed-term Parliaments Act - which would enable the prime minister to call an election without the consent of MPs Thursday's State Opening of Parliament was the 66th time the Queen has opened Parliament - and has come only weeks after the last one on 14 October. There was less pageantry than usual, as was the case the last time a snap election was held in 2017.

"This video can not be played Australians on the heatwave: 'It's so hot, I feel like dying' A state of emergency has been declared in New South Wales, Australia, amid fears a record-breaking heatwave will exacerbate the state's bushfire crisis. The nation endured its hottest-ever day on Tuesday, but that record was smashed again on Wednesday - which saw an average maximum of 41.9C (107.4F). Tuesday's 40.9C had eclipsed the previous record of 40.3C, set in 2013. Authorities in New South Wales (NSW) are currently fighting about 100 fires, in a crisis that has lasted months. Premier Gladys Berejiklian announced a seven-day state of emergency due to forecasts of worsening conditions. ""The biggest concern over the next few days is the unpredictability, with extreme wind conditions [and] extremely hot temperatures,"" she told reporters on Thursday. How do you fight extreme wildfires? NZ cancel warm-up because of heat Why Australia will see a long summer PM Morrison faces anger over bushfires Parts of NSW, of which Sydney is the capital, hit temperatures in the early 40s on Thursday. More intense heat was forecast for the rest of the week. A state of emergency gives fire authorities additional powers to cope with the crisis.It is the second such declaration in NSWsince last month. The Bureau of Meteorology (Bom) said individual December temperature records had been broken in a number of places - with temperatures in the southern city of Adelaide  hitting 45.3C. Nullarbor, also in southern Australia, reached the scorching temperature of 49.9C. Thousands of firefighters have been deployed to tackle the blazes Bushfires have been raging in Australia for months, killing six people, destroying hundreds of homes and burning millions of hectares of land. The crisis - worsened by tinder-dry conditions from a severe drought - has spurred criticism of the nation's climate policies. A lot of outrage on social media has also been directed at Prime Minister Scott Morrison for going on an overseas holiday during the emergency. According to local media, he is in Hawaii with his family. Some 500 people on Thursday protested outside his Sydney residence, demanding action on climate change. In one widely shared tweet, the model who in 2006 became the face of the famous Australian tourism campaign slogan ""Where the bloody hell are you?"" directed the phrase at Mr Morrison.

Australia heated up this week as a mass of hot air swept east across the continent. The dominant climate driver behind the heat has been a positive Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) - an event where sea surface temperatures are warmer in the western half of the ocean, cooler in the east. The difference between the two temperatures is currently the strongest in 60 years. This video can not be played Australia heatwave: All-time temperature record broken again The warmer waters cause higher-than-average rains in the western Indian Ocean region, leading to flooding, and drier conditions across South East Asia and Australia. Australian politicians have faced criticism recently for failing to link the bushfire crisis to climate change. The science around climate change is complex - it is not the cause of bushfires, butscientists have long warned that a hotter, drier climate would contribute to Australia's firesbecoming more frequent and more intense. According to Bom, Australia has warmed overall by slightly more than 1C since 1910, with most of the heating occurring since 1950. Officials predict that 2019, on the temperatures recorded so far, will be among the four warmest years on record. Australia's deadly relationship with heat The phenomenon linking floods and bushfires Bom has urged people to keep cool, drink lots of water and follow the advice of emergency services amid the latest heatwave. Temperatures are expected to exceed 45C in NSW, Victoria and South Australia. Heatwaves are Australia's deadliest natural disaster and have killed thousands more people than bushfires or floods. Officials have warned that the combination of high temperatures and strong winds could heighten the crisis. Two major fires are currently burning near the outskirts of Sydney, including a ""mega blaze"" which has burnt over 400,000 hectares. Heavy smoke was seen blanketing the city's famous tourist sites On Thursday, three firefighters suffered serious burns after being ""enveloped by fire"" near the town of Bargo, officials said. They added it was too early to say how many houses had been razed. Smoke from the fires blanketed Sydney again, pushing air quality beyond ""hazardous"" levels in parts of the city. Sydney 'choking' on thick smoke from bushfires Protesters demand action on climate change Is climate change to blame for Australia's fires? A state-wide ""total fire ban"" has been put in place across NSW until midnight on Saturday. Emergency services in the state of Queensland evacuated residents from dozens of homes on Wednesday as they battled to contain an out-of-control fire. ""You need to be ready to follow your bushfire survival plan. If you do not have a plan, or intend to leave, you should be ready to leave the area because the situation could get worse quickly,"" they warned. Have you been affected by the heat or bushfires?

"Bank of England chief operating officer Joanna Place is responsible for information security A former member of the Bank of England has called for the resignation of its chief operating officer after it emerged an audio feed of sensitive information had been leaked to traders. The Bank admitted one of its suppliers had ""misused"" the feed to give hedge funds early access to information. Danny Blanchflower, who previously served on the rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee, said Joanna Place should step down following the breach. The Bank of England refused to comment. Many Bank press conferences are broadcast via video, but there is also a back-up audio feed in case of problems. The audio is available between five and eight seconds before the video. It meant that high-speed financial traders had access to the words of Governor Mark Carney and his officials before their remarks were more widely broadcast. Ms Place reports directly to Mr Carney and has had responsibility for information security since July 2017. Mr Blanchflower said: ""The question I ask is did the chief operating officer at the Bank of England know that access was being sold? If so, she should resign. And if she didn't know she should resign as well. ""I just don't know how her position is maintained because this could have created a lot of harm. People could have made a lot of money."" The Bank of England said it had disabled the audio supplier's access. Bank governor Mark Carney is due to stand down at the end of January The hijacking of the audio feed, first reportedin the Times,external, gave an advantage to high-speed traders, such as currency speculators, who can make millions of pounds on tiny market moves. Comments from Bank officials about market sensitive matters such as interest rate decisions can affect the value of sterling and other market assets within fractions of a second. The Times said it understood that the eavesdropping on the press conferences had been happening at least since the beginning of this year. Mr Blanchflower said the ""astonishing"" revelation was ""a stain"" on Mr Carney as he prepares to step down as Governor on 31 January. Commenting on who could be in line to replace Mr Carney, Mr Blanchflower said his ""old graduate school room mate"" Gerard Lyons, who was Prime Minister Boris Johnson's former chief economist when he was Mayor of London, may ""rise to the top of pack"". The Bank of England said the leak ""was wholly unacceptable use of the audio feed"" and the way hedge funds were allowed to make use of it was ""without the Bank's knowledge or consent, and is being investigated further"". The matter has been referred to the market regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, which told the BBC it was ""looking at the issue"". Being able to hear the press conference early would provide an unfair advantage. Interest rates, economic guidance, and the financial health of banks and the markets are frequently discussed at the press conferences. The Bank sets rates eight times a year and holds a press conference on four of those occasions. A report on financial stability comes out twice, which also includes a press conference. All of this is broadcast on video provided by Bloomberg, which is shared to other news outlets. The company that provides the audio feed, which is separate from the video feed, has not been identified. A spokesperson from Bloomberg confirmed to the BBC that the company does not provide the audio. ""Bloomberg provides a distinct and independent video feed for the BoE's press conferences. This is completely separate to the backup audio feed."" The pronouncements of central bank chiefs can sound like boring technical gobbledy-gook. But every word, every nuance, is carefully studied by financial markets for the slightest hint about the Bank's intentions and can cause big movements in the value of the pound and government bonds. So getting wind of any potential future changes, even a few seconds ahead of the rest of the market, could be extremely valuable. Computerised trading programs can execute thousands of transactions a second, so the four-to-eight second advantage enjoyed by those traders accessing the back-up audio feed is a vast amount of time in terms of market movements. The Bank of England is usually very careful in managing the dissemination of sensitive information and the Bank was keen to stress that the information breach did not apply to the release of decisions on interest rates - just the press conferences afterwards. But those press conferences can - and do - move markets so this is still an embarrassing admission. The Times said it had seen documents revealing how the service was sold on to traders. The supply cost between Â£2,500 and Â£5,000 each press conference for each client in addition to a subscription fee. It is unclear whether the leaked audio feed was used by traditional traders at their desks to steal a march on rivals, or whether algorithm-driven software, that can conduct thousands of transactions a second, could be used to exploit those few seconds advantage. Hypothetically a computer program could be designed to pick out key words from the Bank Governor's comments and trade on them. But central bankers are notoriously euphemistic. ""[Early access] would be more important to a traditional voice trader or hedge fund,"" says Malcolm Baker, co-Founder at FX FWD, a trading firm. ""Central bankers can speak in language that is hard to understand and there is a lot that's implied. It's like old Elizabethan language and can be misleading. A trader like me just wants to understand - is it hawkish? Or dovish?"" The Bank has not named the audio supplier, but market intelligence firm Statisma has posted a denial that it offers its customers information not available to the public. Statisma, operating under the same management as a production firm called Encoded Media, advertises on Twitter a service where traders can hear central bank announcements first. Statisma offers on Twitter its audio feeds for several central bank announcements Press conferences from the European Central Bank, the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of Canada were also on offer to trading firms. Traders signed up to Statisma's service receive an email detailing the speeches with dial in numbers. In a response to several calls made from the BBC and other media outlets, it posted on its website this statement: ""We DO NOT carry embargoed information and we DO NOT release information without it first being made available to the public"". An ECB spokesman said the central bank moved to address possible issues with audio broadcasts in September, effectively delaying the feed. ""Since September this year the ECB offers a low latency audio feed for each monetary policy press conference to address exactly the issues that were in the news today. ""Therefore, it doesn't make any sense for anyone to use commercially offered solutions because the solution we offer is the fastest option available and it is free for everyone,"" the spokesman said.

LIVE: Reaction to State Opening of Parliament What does the Queen's Speech mean for you? What is the Queen's Speech and why is it important? Addressing Parliament for the second time in less than three months, the Queen said the priority for her government was to deliver Brexit on 31 January, but ministers also had an ""ambitious programme of domestic reform that delivers on the people's priorities"". Of the more than 30 bills announced in the Queen's Speech, seven were on Brexit. This video can not be played Queen's speech outlines plans for Brexit and NHS It comes as the government says it will close its Department for Exiting the European Union on 31 January. The seven bills announced that were devoted to Brexit cover legislation on trade, agriculture, fisheries, immigration, financial services and private international law. The first to be put to Parliament will be the Withdrawal Agreement Bill - the legislation that enables the UK to leave the EU - on Friday before the Christmas recess. Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn walked to the House of Lords together in silence Following last week's general election, the prime minister has a Commons majority of 80 - the largest enjoyed by a Conservative leader since Margaret Thatcher in 1987. Five big things on Boris Johnson's to-do list What is in Boris Johnson's Brexit deal? The prime minister's increased parliamentary authority and command of his party means it is likely to pass without major changes in the New Year in time to meet the 31 January deadline. In another move welcomed by Tory MPs, the bill willalso enable more British judgesto depart from previous rulings of the EU's top court. On the NHS, the government says it will enshrine in law a commitment on the health service's funding, with an extra Â£33.9bn per year provided by 2023/24. The PM's commitment on the NHS amounts to a 3.4% year-on-year increase in expenditure, a significant increase on what the NHS received during the five year Tory-Lib Dem coalition government as well as under his predecessors David Cameron and Theresa May. But it is significantly lower than the 6% average annual increases seen under Labour leaders Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. And when adjusted for inflation, and factoring in the increased cost of equipment, medicines and staff pay, it could actually be worth Â£20.5bn by 2023-4. The Tories' environmental plans analysed Do the Tories' broadband plans add up? Why do prisoners only serve half their sentence? Labour's health spokesman Jonathan Ashworth said: ""If the Conservatives' plans to put funding increases into law is to be anything other than an empty gimmick, we would urge them to pledge the extra Â£6bn a year which experts say is needed to start to make up the cuts they've imposed for a decade."" There was also a commitment announced for ministers to seek cross-party consensus for long-term reform of the social care system and the government will continue work to reform the Mental Health Act. This government wants to try to give the appearance that they are completely new, completely different, even though the Conservatives have been in power for nearly a full decade. That is quite a political stunt to try to pull off. But it's clear also that Boris Johnson came to the Commons today to present a vision that he hopes can straddle left and right, or what has traditionally been seen as Labour's place in politics and the Conservatives' place in politics. That is what the results of the general election gave him as an opportunity. And the challenge for Boris Johnson is not just to hold onto that for five years, but show to people who voted Tory for the first time that the party was worth the risk - that their vote was the right decision. The test will be enormous - whether or not all that rhetoric actually matches up to the reality of the actions and decisions that this government will make. Mr Johnson has had a reputation for years of being hungry with ambition to get to this place. We're going to find out in the next months and years whether he's hungry to take the decisions that actually will cement his place in history. Plans for longer sentences for violent criminals, were also unveiled, as well as the establishment of a Royal Commission to improve the ""efficiency and effectiveness"" of the criminal justice process and there are bills that will ensure the most serious violent offenders serve longer prison terms. And those charged with knife possession will face ""swift justice"". Other announcements in the Queen's Speech included: A ""points-based immigration system"", allowing the UK to welcome skilled workers On housing, landlords will get more rights to gain possession of their property and a new ""lifetime deposit"" scheme has been proposed which will mean tenants do not have to find a new deposit every time they move A pledge to cut business rates for thousands of retailers, pubs and restaurants across England and Wales. With the aim of helping struggling high streets, the government promised to increase the retail discount on rates by a third to 50%, costing Â£320m A new visa to ""ensure qualified doctors, nurses and health professionals have fast-track entry to the United Kingdom"" The removal of hospital car parking charges ""for those in greatest need"" New laws to ""accelerate the delivery of gigabit capable broadband"" The government will continue to take steps to meet net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 Work will be taken forward to repeal the Fixed-term Parliaments Act - which would enable the prime minister to call an election without the consent of MPs Thursday's State Opening of Parliament was the 66th time the Queen has opened Parliament - and has come only weeks after the last one on 14 October. There was less pageantry than usual, as was the case the last time a snap election was held in 2017. The Queen travelled by car from Buckingham Palace to Parliament, rather than by horse-drawn carriage, and she did not wear ceremonial dress.

"Universities in England have been told to be more transparent about how they recruit students and not to make exaggerated marketing claims. The Office for Students' annual report warns against sales tactics such as financial inducements or ""unconditional"" exam-grade offers.

Ms Dandridge called for more openness in the admissions process - such as whether students were being given accurate information about what A-level grades were really needed to get on to a course. The OFS could impose fines - and, in recent years, a number of universities have beencriticised by the Advertising Standards Authority for marketing claims that could be misleading. The annual report also reveals a number of universities do not have adequate plans in place for students in the event of a university, or a department or a course, having to shut down.

"The Prison Service and G4S could not decide who should pay for the CCTV system, the report said A troubled jail has been making ""steady progress"" under new leadership but CCTV ""promised for years"" has still not been installed, inspectors have said. HMP Birmingham used to be run by security firm G4S butwas taken back into government control this year. CCTV has never been fitted on wings because both G4S and the Prison Service felt the other should fund it, the Independent Monitoring Board said. The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said CCTV would be installed within six weeks. G4S took on the running of the category B prison, which houses just under 1,000 inmates, in 2011. It lost the contract in April after the chief inspector of prisonsdescribed the jail last year as the worst he had ever been to, two years after a huge riot. A new governor was appointed and the board's latest annual report published on Thursday said a ""reduced prison population and the much-needed capital investment"" since had enabled the prison to start making improvements. Highlighting the lack of CCTV cameras for so many years, the report said ""given the prison had the highest level of staff assaults and prisoner violence in previous years in England and Wales, the failure of the two parties to settle the funding of CCTV deserves criticism"". The delay in installing a body scanner in reception, promised last year, was also criticised. The jail'sfailure to secure funding for the scanner was ""inexplicable"", the chief inspector of prisons saidearlier this year. The MoJ said it would now be fully operational in the new year. However, 14 mobile phones, 133g of tobacco and 14g of cannabis hidden in two pairs of trainers were among items found on visitors by new dedicated search teams over the past year, the report added. Senior leaders have become more visible on wings at key times Senior leaders are held to account and challenged daily in meetings There has been a clear daily focus on the most vulnerable, especially those who self-harm and self-isolate Incidents of self-harm have fluctuated with no clear trend up or down The closure of three Victorian wings was overdue and welcome 'I lived in a sewer for four months' First Christmas at home for premature twins The real story behind Channel 4's The Cure A drop in violence and self-harm had also now made the prison one of the best performing compared with jails of a similar category and population, monitors said. Conditions had also improved and it was now ""unusual"" to find men in ""uninhabitable"" cells with leaking pipework or toilets, the report said. Roger Swindells, chair of the board said: ""Looking ahead, there are clear, encouraging signs of further progress and evidence that HMP Birmingham is working hard to become a more decent and respectful place for all who live and work there,  with the intention of ensuring that prisoners are better prepared for release."" The MoJ said violence was down by two-thirds this year and it welcomed the fact the ""tireless"" work by staff was being recognised. ""The prison will benefit from our Â£100m investment in new security measures like body scanners, part of an additional Â£2.75bn that will be spent on our jails,"" it said.

"Bank of England chief operating officer Joanna Place is responsible for information security A former member of the Bank of England has called for the resignation of its chief operating officer after it emerged an audio feed of sensitive information had been leaked to traders. The Bank admitted one of its suppliers had ""misused"" the feed to give hedge funds early access to information. Danny Blanchflower, who previously served on the rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee, said Joanna Place should step down following the breach. The Bank of England refused to comment. Many Bank press conferences are broadcast via video, but there is also a back-up audio feed in case of problems. The audio is available between five and eight seconds before the video. It meant that high-speed financial traders had access to the words of Governor Mark Carney and his officials before their remarks were more widely broadcast. Ms Place reports directly to Mr Carney and has had responsibility for information security since July 2017. Mr Blanchflower said: ""The question I ask is did the chief operating officer at the Bank of England know that access was being sold? If so, she should resign. And if she didn't know she should resign as well. ""I just don't know how her position is maintained because this could have created a lot of harm. People could have made a lot of money."" The Bank of England said it had disabled the audio supplier's access. Bank governor Mark Carney is due to stand down at the end of January The hijacking of the audio feed, first reportedin the Times,external, gave an advantage to high-speed traders, such as currency speculators, who can make millions of pounds on tiny market moves. Comments from Bank officials about market sensitive matters such as interest rate decisions can affect the value of sterling and other market assets within fractions of a second. The Times said it understood that the eavesdropping on the press conferences had been happening at least since the beginning of this year. Mr Blanchflower said the ""astonishing"" revelation was ""a stain"" on Mr Carney as he prepares to step down as Governor on 31 January. Commenting on who could be in line to replace Mr Carney, Mr Blanchflower said his ""old graduate school room mate"" Gerard Lyons, who was Prime Minister Boris Johnson's former chief economist when he was Mayor of London, may ""rise to the top of pack"". The Bank of England said the leak ""was wholly unacceptable use of the audio feed"" and the way hedge funds were allowed to make use of it was ""without the Bank's knowledge or consent, and is being investigated further"". The matter has been referred to the market regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, which told the BBC it was ""looking at the issue"". Being able to hear the press conference early would provide an unfair advantage. Interest rates, economic guidance, and the financial health of banks and the markets are frequently discussed at the press conferences. The Bank sets rates eight times a year and holds a press conference on four of those occasions. A report on financial stability comes out twice, which also includes a press conference. All of this is broadcast on video provided by Bloomberg, which is shared to other news outlets. The company that provides the audio feed, which is separate from the video feed, has not been identified. A spokesperson from Bloomberg confirmed to the BBC that the company does not provide the audio. ""Bloomberg provides a distinct and independent video feed for the BoE's press conferences. This is completely separate to the backup audio feed."" The pronouncements of central bank chiefs can sound like boring technical gobbledy-gook. But every word, every nuance, is carefully studied by financial markets for the slightest hint about the Bank's intentions and can cause big movements in the value of the pound and government bonds. So getting wind of any potential future changes, even a few seconds ahead of the rest of the market, could be extremely valuable. Computerised trading programs can execute thousands of transactions a second, so the four-to-eight second advantage enjoyed by those traders accessing the back-up audio feed is a vast amount of time in terms of market movements. The Bank of England is usually very careful in managing the dissemination of sensitive information and the Bank was keen to stress that the information breach did not apply to the release of decisions on interest rates - just the press conferences afterwards. But those press conferences can - and do - move markets so this is still an embarrassing admission. The Times said it had seen documents revealing how the service was sold on to traders. The supply cost between Â£2,500 and Â£5,000 each press conference for each client in addition to a subscription fee. It is unclear whether the leaked audio feed was used by traditional traders at their desks to steal a march on rivals, or whether algorithm-driven software, that can conduct thousands of transactions a second, could be used to exploit those few seconds advantage. Hypothetically a computer program could be designed to pick out key words from the Bank Governor's comments and trade on them. But central bankers are notoriously euphemistic. ""[Early access] would be more important to a traditional voice trader or hedge fund,"" says Malcolm Baker, co-Founder at FX FWD, a trading firm. ""Central bankers can speak in language that is hard to understand and there is a lot that's implied. It's like old Elizabethan language and can be misleading. A trader like me just wants to understand - is it hawkish? Or dovish?"" The Bank has not named the audio supplier, but market intelligence firm Statisma has posted a denial that it offers its customers information not available to the public. Statisma, operating under the same management as a production firm called Encoded Media, advertises on Twitter a service where traders can hear central bank announcements first. Statisma offers on Twitter its audio feeds for several central bank announcements Press conferences from the European Central Bank, the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of Canada were also on offer to trading firms. Traders signed up to Statisma's service receive an email detailing the speeches with dial in numbers. In a response to several calls made from the BBC and other media outlets, it posted on its website this statement: ""We DO NOT carry embargoed information and we DO NOT release information without it first being made available to the public"". An ECB spokesman said the central bank moved to address possible issues with audio broadcasts in September, effectively delaying the feed. ""Since September this year the ECB offers a low latency audio feed for each monetary policy press conference to address exactly the issues that were in the news today. ""Therefore, it doesn't make any sense for anyone to use commercially offered solutions because the solution we offer is the fastest option available and it is free for everyone,"" the spokesman said.

"This video can not be played Australians on the heatwave: 'It's so hot, I feel like dying' A state of emergency has been declared in New South Wales, Australia, amid fears a record-breaking heatwave will exacerbate the state's bushfire crisis. The nation endured its hottest-ever day on Tuesday, but that record was smashed again on Wednesday - which saw an average maximum of 41.9C (107.4F). Tuesday's 40.9C had eclipsed the previous record of 40.3C, set in 2013. Authorities in New South Wales (NSW) are currently fighting about 100 fires, in a crisis that has lasted months. Premier Gladys Berejiklian announced a seven-day state of emergency due to forecasts of worsening conditions. ""The biggest concern over the next few days is the unpredictability, with extreme wind conditions [and] extremely hot temperatures,"" she told reporters on Thursday. How do you fight extreme wildfires? NZ cancel warm-up because of heat Why Australia will see a long summer PM Morrison faces anger over bushfires Parts of NSW, of which Sydney is the capital, hit temperatures in the early 40s on Thursday. More intense heat was forecast for the rest of the week. A state of emergency gives fire authorities additional powers to cope with the crisis.It is the second such declaration in NSWsince last month. The Bureau of Meteorology (Bom) said individual December temperature records had been broken in a number of places - with temperatures in the southern city of Adelaide  hitting 45.3C. Nullarbor, also in southern Australia, reached the scorching temperature of 49.9C. Thousands of firefighters have been deployed to tackle the blazes Bushfires have been raging in Australia for months, killing six people, destroying hundreds of homes and burning millions of hectares of land. The crisis - worsened by tinder-dry conditions from a severe drought - has spurred criticism of the nation's climate policies. A lot of outrage on social media has also been directed at Prime Minister Scott Morrison for going on an overseas holiday during the emergency. According to local media, he is in Hawaii with his family. Some 500 people on Thursday protested outside his Sydney residence, demanding action on climate change. In one widely shared tweet, the model who in 2006 became the face of the famous Australian tourism campaign slogan ""Where the bloody hell are you?"" directed the phrase at Mr Morrison.

Australia heated up this week as a mass of hot air swept east across the continent. The dominant climate driver behind the heat has been a positive Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) - an event where sea surface temperatures are warmer in the western half of the ocean, cooler in the east. The difference between the two temperatures is currently the strongest in 60 years. This video can not be played Australia heatwave: All-time temperature record broken again The warmer waters cause higher-than-average rains in the western Indian Ocean region, leading to flooding, and drier conditions across South East Asia and Australia. Australian politicians have faced criticism recently for failing to link the bushfire crisis to climate change. The science around climate change is complex - it is not the cause of bushfires, butscientists have long warned that a hotter, drier climate would contribute to Australia's firesbecoming more frequent and more intense. According to Bom, Australia has warmed overall by slightly more than 1C since 1910, with most of the heating occurring since 1950. Officials predict that 2019, on the temperatures recorded so far, will be among the four warmest years on record. Australia's deadly relationship with heat The phenomenon linking floods and bushfires Bom has urged people to keep cool, drink lots of water and follow the advice of emergency services amid the latest heatwave. Temperatures are expected to exceed 45C in NSW, Victoria and South Australia. Heatwaves are Australia's deadliest natural disaster and have killed thousands more people than bushfires or floods. Officials have warned that the combination of high temperatures and strong winds could heighten the crisis. Two major fires are currently burning near the outskirts of Sydney, including a ""mega blaze"" which has burnt over 400,000 hectares. Heavy smoke was seen blanketing the city's famous tourist sites On Thursday, three firefighters suffered serious burns after being ""enveloped by fire"" near the town of Bargo, officials said. They added it was too early to say how many houses had been razed. Smoke from the fires blanketed Sydney again, pushing air quality beyond ""hazardous"" levels in parts of the city. Sydney 'choking' on thick smoke from bushfires Protesters demand action on climate change Is climate change to blame for Australia's fires? A state-wide ""total fire ban"" has been put in place across NSW until midnight on Saturday. Emergency services in the state of Queensland evacuated residents from dozens of homes on Wednesday as they battled to contain an out-of-control fire. ""You need to be ready to follow your bushfire survival plan. If you do not have a plan, or intend to leave, you should be ready to leave the area because the situation could get worse quickly,"" they warned. Have you been affected by the heat or bushfires?

"This video can not be played Australians on the heatwave: 'It's so hot, I feel like dying' A state of emergency has been declared in New South Wales, Australia, amid fears a record-breaking heatwave will exacerbate the state's bushfire crisis. The nation endured its hottest-ever day on Tuesday, but that record was smashed again on Wednesday - which saw an average maximum of 41.9C (107.4F). Tuesday's 40.9C had eclipsed the previous record of 40.3C, set in 2013. Authorities in New South Wales (NSW) are currently fighting about 100 fires, in a crisis that has lasted months. Premier Gladys Berejiklian announced a seven-day state of emergency due to forecasts of worsening conditions. ""The biggest concern over the next few days is the unpredictability, with extreme wind conditions [and] extremely hot temperatures,"" she told reporters on Thursday. How do you fight extreme wildfires? NZ cancel warm-up because of heat Why Australia will see a long summer PM Morrison faces anger over bushfires Parts of NSW, of which Sydney is the capital, hit temperatures in the early 40s on Thursday. More intense heat was forecast for the rest of the week. A state of emergency gives fire authorities additional powers to cope with the crisis.It is the second such declaration in NSWsince last month. The Bureau of Meteorology (Bom) said individual December temperature records had been broken in a number of places - with temperatures in the southern city of Adelaide  hitting 45.3C. Nullarbor, also in southern Australia, reached the scorching temperature of 49.9C. Thousands of firefighters have been deployed to tackle the blazes Bushfires have been raging in Australia for months, killing six people, destroying hundreds of homes and burning millions of hectares of land. The crisis - worsened by tinder-dry conditions from a severe drought - has spurred criticism of the nation's climate policies. A lot of outrage on social media has also been directed at Prime Minister Scott Morrison for going on an overseas holiday during the emergency. According to local media, he is in Hawaii with his family. Some 500 people on Thursday protested outside his Sydney residence, demanding action on climate change. In one widely shared tweet, the model who in 2006 became the face of the famous Australian tourism campaign slogan ""Where the bloody hell are you?"" directed the phrase at Mr Morrison.

Australia heated up this week as a mass of hot air swept east across the continent. The dominant climate driver behind the heat has been a positive Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) - an event where sea surface temperatures are warmer in the western half of the ocean, cooler in the east. The difference between the two temperatures is currently the strongest in 60 years. This video can not be played Australia heatwave: All-time temperature record broken again The warmer waters cause higher-than-average rains in the western Indian Ocean region, leading to flooding, and drier conditions across South East Asia and Australia.

"This video can not be played Queen's Speech: Brexit, the NHS and what happened next Boris Johnson has claimed his programme for government is the ""most radical Queen's Speech in a generation"". The prime minister said planned new laws to toughen up criminal justice and increase NHS spending would deliver on the ""people's priorities"". But his main priority is the UK's exit from the EU on 31 January. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said many of the PM's promises mimicked the ""language of Labour policy but without the substance"". ""They say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, even when it's a very pale imitation, but I fear those swayed by the prime minister's promises will be sorely disappointed,"" added the Labour leader. And SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford accused the PM of ""denying [Scotland] the right to choose our own future"" referring to the SNP's desire for another referendum on Scottish independence. ""Why did democracy stop in the prime minister's world with the independence referendum in 2014?"" he asked. But Boris Johnson said he felt a ""colossal sense of obligation"" to the voters. He told MPs that ""a new golden age for this United Kingdom is now within reach"" adding that the government would ""work flat out to deliver it"". LIVE: Reaction to State Opening of Parliament What does the Queen's Speech mean for you? What is the Queen's Speech and why is it important? Addressing Parliament for the second time in less than three months, the Queen said the priority for her government was to deliver Brexit on 31 January, but ministers also had an ""ambitious programme of domestic reform that delivers on the people's priorities"". Of the more than 30 bills announced in the Queen's Speech, seven were on Brexit. This video can not be played Queen's speech outlines plans for Brexit and NHS It comes as the government says it will close its Department for Exiting the European Union on 31 January. The seven bills announced that were devoted to Brexit cover legislation on trade, agriculture, fisheries, immigration, financial services and private international law. The first to be put to Parliament will be the Withdrawal Agreement Bill - the legislation that enables the UK to leave the EU - on Friday before the Christmas recess. Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn walked to the House of Lords together in silence Following last week's general election, the prime minister has a Commons majority of 80 - the largest enjoyed by a Conservative leader since Margaret Thatcher in 1987. Five big things on Boris Johnson's to-do list What is in Boris Johnson's Brexit deal? The prime minister's increased parliamentary authority and command of his party means it is likely to pass without major changes in the New Year in time to meet the 31 January deadline. In another move welcomed by Tory MPs, the bill willalso enable more British judgesto depart from previous rulings of the EU's top court. On the NHS, the government says it will enshrine in law a commitment on the health service's funding, with an extra Â£33.9bn per year provided by 2023/24. The PM's commitment on the NHS amounts to a 3.4% year-on-year increase in expenditure, a significant increase on what the NHS received during the five year Tory-Lib Dem coalition government as well as under his predecessors David Cameron and Theresa May. But it is significantly lower than the 6% average annual increases seen under Labour leaders Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. And when adjusted for inflation, and factoring in the increased cost of equipment, medicines and staff pay, it could actually be worth Â£20.5bn by 2023-4. The Tories' environmental plans analysed Do the Tories' broadband plans add up? Why do prisoners only serve half their sentence? Labour's health spokesman Jonathan Ashworth said: ""If the Conservatives' plans to put funding increases into law is to be anything other than an empty gimmick, we would urge them to pledge the extra Â£6bn a year which experts say is needed to start to make up the cuts they've imposed for a decade."" There was also a commitment announced for ministers to seek cross-party consensus for long-term reform of the social care system and the government will continue work to reform the Mental Health Act. This government wants to try to give the appearance that they are completely new, completely different, even though the Conservatives have been in power for nearly a full decade. That is quite a political stunt to try to pull off. But it's clear also that Boris Johnson came to the Commons today to present a vision that he hopes can straddle left and right, or what has traditionally been seen as Labour's place in politics and the Conservatives' place in politics. That is what the results of the general election gave him as an opportunity. And the challenge for Boris Johnson is not just to hold onto that for five years, but show to people who voted Tory for the first time that the party was worth the risk - that their vote was the right decision. The test will be enormous - whether or not all that rhetoric actually matches up to the reality of the actions and decisions that this government will make. Mr Johnson has had a reputation for years of being hungry with ambition to get to this place. We're going to find out in the next months and years whether he's hungry to take the decisions that actually will cement his place in history. Plans for longer sentences for violent criminals, were also unveiled, as well as the establishment of a Royal Commission to improve the ""efficiency and effectiveness"" of the criminal justice process and there are bills that will ensure the most serious violent offenders serve longer prison terms. And those charged with knife possession will face ""swift justice"". Other announcements in the Queen's Speech included: A ""points-based immigration system"", allowing the UK to welcome skilled workers On housing, landlords will get more rights to gain possession of their property and a new ""lifetime deposit"" scheme has been proposed which will mean tenants do not have to find a new deposit every time they move A pledge to cut business rates for thousands of retailers, pubs and restaurants across England and Wales. With the aim of helping struggling high streets, the government promised to increase the retail discount on rates by a third to 50%, costing Â£320m A new visa to ""ensure qualified doctors, nurses and health professionals have fast-track entry to the United Kingdom"" The removal of hospital car parking charges ""for those in greatest need"" New laws to ""accelerate the delivery of gigabit capable broadband"" The government will continue to take steps to meet net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 Work will be taken forward to repeal the Fixed-term Parliaments Act - which would enable the prime minister to call an election without the consent of MPs Thursday's State Opening of Parliament was the 66th time the Queen has opened Parliament - and has come only weeks after the last one on 14 October. There was less pageantry than usual, as was the case the last time a snap election was held in 2017. The Queen travelled by car from Buckingham Palace to Parliament, rather than by horse-drawn carriage, and she did not wear ceremonial dress.

"The Prison Service and G4S could not decide who should pay for the CCTV system, the report said A troubled jail has been making ""steady progress"" under new leadership but CCTV ""promised for years"" has still not been installed, inspectors have said. HMP Birmingham used to be run by security firm G4S butwas taken back into government control this year. CCTV has never been fitted on wings because both G4S and the Prison Service felt the other should fund it, the Independent Monitoring Board said. The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said CCTV would be installed within six weeks. G4S took on the running of the category B prison, which houses just under 1,000 inmates, in 2011. It lost the contract in April after the chief inspector of prisonsdescribed the jail last year as the worst he had ever been to, two years after a huge riot. A new governor was appointed and the board's latest annual report published on Thursday said a ""reduced prison population and the much-needed capital investment"" since had enabled the prison to start making improvements. Highlighting the lack of CCTV cameras for so many years, the report said ""given the prison had the highest level of staff assaults and prisoner violence in previous years in England and Wales, the failure of the two parties to settle the funding of CCTV deserves criticism"". The delay in installing a body scanner in reception, promised last year, was also criticised. The jail'sfailure to secure funding for the scanner was ""inexplicable"", the chief inspector of prisons saidearlier this year. The MoJ said it would now be fully operational in the new year. However, 14 mobile phones, 133g of tobacco and 14g of cannabis hidden in two pairs of trainers were among items found on visitors by new dedicated search teams over the past year, the report added. Senior leaders have become more visible on wings at key times Senior leaders are held to account and challenged daily in meetings There has been a clear daily focus on the most vulnerable, especially those who self-harm and self-isolate Incidents of self-harm have fluctuated with no clear trend up or down The closure of three Victorian wings was overdue and welcome 'I lived in a sewer for four months' First Christmas at home for premature twins The real story behind Channel 4's The Cure A drop in violence and self-harm had also now made the prison one of the best performing compared with jails of a similar category and population, monitors said. Conditions had also improved and it was now ""unusual"" to find men in ""uninhabitable"" cells with leaking pipework or toilets, the report said. Roger Swindells, chair of the board said: ""Looking ahead, there are clear, encouraging signs of further progress and evidence that HMP Birmingham is working hard to become a more decent and respectful place for all who live and work there,  with the intention of ensuring that prisoners are better prepared for release."" The MoJ said violence was down by two-thirds this year and it welcomed the fact the ""tireless"" work by staff was being recognised. ""The prison will benefit from our Â£100m investment in new security measures like body scanners, part of an additional Â£2.75bn that will be spent on our jails,"" it said.
