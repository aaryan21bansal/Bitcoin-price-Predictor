"A cache of Facebook documents has been seized by MPs investigating the Cambridge Analytica data scandal. Rarely used parliamentary powers were used to demand that the boss of a US software firm hand over the details. The Observer,which first reported the story,external, said the documents included data about Facebook's privacy controls. MP Damian Collins later told the BBC that he believed the documents were ""highly relevant"" to his inquiry. Facebook has demanded their return. The documents were intercepted when an executive of US tech firm Six4Three was on a trip to London. In a highly unusual move the House of Commons serjeant-at-arms was sent to the businessman's hotel and he was given a final warning and a two-hour deadline to comply with the order. When the executive failed to do so he was escorted to Parliament and warned he risked fines and imprisonment if the documents were not surrendered, the paper said. The firm is involved in court action against Facebook in the US, where the documents were obtained through legal procedures. Facebook v Soros: 'Congress must probe' Facebook appeals Cambridge Analytica fine Facebook treated voters with 'disrespect' Facebook told the Observer: ""The materials obtained by the DCMS committee are subject to a protective order of the San Mateo Superior Court restricting their disclosure. ""We have asked the DCMS committee to refrain from reviewing them and to return them to counsel or to Facebook."" But Damian Collins, chairman of the Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) Committee, said he believes the documents - which include emails - contain important information about how Facebook and other parties handle user data. He said he had written to Facebook stressing the House of Commons had powers to seize documents within UK jurisdiction. In his email to Facebook public policy vice president Richard Allen, which he posted on Twitter on Sunday evening, Mr Collins said a committee of the House can publish these documents under parliamentary privilege.

In an email to Mr Collins, also shared on Twitter, Mr Allen said that Six4Three's case against Facebook was ""entirely without merit"" and should not be taken at ""face value"". ""We hope you will want to reflect on the core issue behind the complaint... The case being brought by Six4Three is a challenge against our efforts to restrict access to data by apps in 2014/2015. ""On earlier occasions, your committee appeared to endorse this more restrictive approach. If this has now changed, it would be useful to understand why,"" he wrote. Mr Allan is due to appear before a DCMS committee hearing on Tuesday where details from the documents could be made public. Facebook and its founder Mark Zuckerberg have faced intense pressure over the social media giant's use of personal data, the spread of fake news, and, this month, allegations that it hired a PR firm to make claims about the financier George Soros. Last month the UK data watchdog fined Facebook Â£500,000 following its investigation into the Cambridge Analytica affair. Facebook has appealed against the fine, claiming that the watchdog found no evidence that UK users' personal data had been shared inappropriately and the penalty was therefore unjustified. The Cambridge Analytica scandal stems from the discovery that an academic at the University of Cambridge - Dr Aleksandr Kogan - used a personality quiz to harvest up to 87 million Facebook users' details. Some of this was subsequently shared with the political consultancy Cambridge Analytica, which used it to target political advertising in the US. It was initially reportedthat about 1.1 million UK-based users had had their details exposed.

"This video can not be played US closes border crossing after migrant rush Mexico says it has deported nearly 100 Central American migrants a day after they tried to storm the US border. The group, among thousands of migrants heading towards the US, was rounded up after trying to cross the border ""violently"" and ""illegally"" on Sunday, said the interior ministry. Video footage shows dozens of people running towards the border fence near the city of Tijuana. US border officers used tear gas to repel them and said some threw rocks. US President Donald Trump hasreiterated a threat he made last weekto close the border completely. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

On Monday US officials confirmed that 42 people who managed to cross on Sunday had been arrested, accused of disturbing the peace and other charges. And Gerardo Garcia Benavente, of Mexico's migration office, said: ""98 foreigners were returned to their country last night following the violent incident at the border post."" Tension has been running high on the US-Mexican border since the arrival of almost 7,500 migrants over the past weeks. Humanitarian crisis develops in Tijuana What is the migrant caravan heading to US? The migrants, who are mostly from Honduras, but also from Guatemala and El Salvador, say they are fleeing the threat of violence in their home countries and looking to make a better life for themselves and their families. They have travelled in large groups, dubbed ""caravans"", for more than 4,000km (2,500 miles) from Central America and most want to reach the United States, where they say they plan to ask for asylum. Among them are many families with young children. President Trump has vowed to keep each migrant on the Mexican side of the border until courts have decided their cases, meaning some face a long wait. They have been spending the past two weeks in temporary shelters in the Mexican border city of Tijuana and in Mexicali, 180km to the east along the border. A group of at least 500 migrants joined a march from their shelter in Tijuana towards the border on Sunday. The march started peacefully Mexican Interior Minister Alfonso Navarrete said the migrants had asked for help to organise the demonstration but were then reportedly encouraged by some of the movement's leaders to split into different groups so they could make a run for the border and try to cross into the US. The march started peacefully with migrants carrying pro-immigration banners and shouting: ""We aren't criminals! We are hard workers!"" But once they managed to get past the security cordon, the march quickly turned into a dash for the border, BBC correspondent Will Grant reports. But when a group split off and made a dash for the border, US border patrol reacted Some migrants managed to climb the border fence But they were driven back by tear gas Several hundred managed to climb over the first barrier, according to AFP news agency. It was as they tried to cross a second, spike-topped wall that officials on the US side began firing tear gas. An AFP journalist saw the migrants - including mothers and children - trying to protect themselves from the gas. Associated Press Mexico correspondentChris Sherman said he had seen parents running away with choking toddlers,external. Among them was Honduran migrant Ana Zuniga, 23, and her three-year-old child: ""We ran but when you run, the smoke smothers you more."" US Customs and Border Protection, which polices the border, said its personnel had been assaulted and hit by rocks. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Chief Patrol Agent Rodney Scott told CNN on Monday: ""There were sections that had dilapidated border wall that was made out of scrap metal the military gave us. ""The group breached a couple of sections of that, actually tore down one small section."" As a result of Sunday's action, the US closed the San Ysidro border crossing near Tijuana to vehicles and pedestrians for a number of hours, causing long delays in both directions. The San Ysidro border crossing is the busiest between Mexico and the US US Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said the migrants had tried to harm US border guards ""by throwing projectiles at them"". She said the department would ""not tolerate this type of lawlessness and will not hesitate to shut down ports of entry for security and public safety reasons"" and that US officials would ""seek to prosecute"" offenders. Mr Trump has said he has given troops at the border the go-ahead to use lethal force if needed, but no soldiers were involved in Sunday's confrontation. Mexico's interior ministry said that, ""far from helping their objectives"", the migrants' actions had violated the legal migration framework and could have led to a ""serious incident"". The ministry also said on Sunday it has deported 11,000 Central Americans since 19 October, when this influx of migrants first entered the country. The mood in the migrant shelter is likely to darken, says the BBC's Will Grant. And with many in the shelters realising how long the wait for asylum could be, some, like Honduran Joseph GarcÃ­a, are growing increasingly desperate: ""My little girl is sick and I don't even have money for milk. I can't stand it anymore."" Mexican officials deny US border deal What is the migrant caravan heading to US?

"This video can not be played Who are the Sentinelese? Indian officials are facing a difficult task to retrieve the body of an American missionary reportedly killed by an endangered tribe in the Andaman and Nicobar islands. A police boat faced off with Sentinelese tribesmen on Saturday but withdrew to avoid confrontation. John Allen Chau was said to have been killed with arrows when he landed on North Sentinel. He was trying to convert the protected people to Christianity. The fishermen who ferried Chau, 27, to North Sentinel on 17 November said they saw tribesmen drag a body along a beach and bury it. The fishermen later accompanied police back to the point on the island where they believed the body was buried. Six fishermen and one other person have been arrested over the incident. What we could learn from remote tribes Who was US man killed in remote islands? On Saturday, police stationed their boat about 400m (437 yards) offshore and, using binoculars, saw tribesmen on the beach armed with bows and arrows. Regional police chief Dependra Pathak told Agence France-Presse: ""They stared at us and we were looking at them."" The boat then withdrew. ""We have mapped the area with the help of these fishermen. We have not spotted the body yet but we roughly know the area where he is believed to be buried,"" Mr Pathak said. Few images of the endangered tribe exist The Sentinelese stand guard on an island beach in 2005 Outsiders are banned from even approaching the island so as to protect the people who live there, and their way of life. The complete isolation of the Sentinelese people means contact with the outside world could put them at risk, as they are likely to have no immunity to even common illnesses such as flu and measles. The tribesmen have treated outsiders with hostility for years. In 2006, two fishermen were killed and their bodies placed on bamboo stakes, Mr Pathak said. Those bodies were recovered but fears remain that Chau's may never be retrieved. A murder case has been registered against unknown persons but it has not been suggested tribesmen will face any charges. Chau's family have said they forgive those who killed him.

"Jaydon James, 16, was described by local residents as a ""quiet"", ""lovely boy"" A 16-year old boy has died after being stabbed in Coventry. The victim, named by police as Jaydon Washington James, was found in Deedmore Road, Wood End, at about 23:40 GMT on Saturday. He died in hospital later. Police said Jaydon was attacked while with friends, who were also seriously injured and are in hospital. A murder investigation has been launched and West Midlands Police said officers were ""following a number of active lines of inquiry"". Jaydon's family said they were ""deeply saddened"" by what had happened and called for anyone with information to come forward. Deedmore Road was cordoned off near the Moat House and Castle Wood School Forensic officers have been checking drains as well as around bins and vehicles on Deedmore Road. Searches have also been carried out in the grounds of the nearby St Patrick's Catholic Church. Bunches of flowers have been left against a wall of the church in tribute to Jaydon, also known as JJ. Det Supt Matt Markham described the death as a ""terrible loss"" and said officers were ""working round the clock to find who was responsible"". Det Ch Insp Edward Foster, from the force's homicide unit, added: ""Jaydon had only just turned 16 with his whole life ahead of him. ""Words cannot describe the anguish that his family are going through, and we will leave no stone unturned in the hunt for his killer."" Forensics officers have been checking drains, bins and the grounds of a nearby school A family friend told the BBC the community had been ""completely shocked"" and described Jaydon as a quiet boy who was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Another local resident, Rebecca Rushton-Nesbitt, said: ""He was just an ordinary young boy. He wouldn't do anything to hurt anybody."" The road by Moat House Leisure Centre was blocked off by police, with a cordon about 200 yards (180m) further down the road at the entrance to the Moat House and Castle Wood School.

"Dozens of people in Aleppo were treated with breathing difficulties overnight Russia has carried out air strikes against Syrian rebels it accuses of launching a chemical attack on the government-held city of Aleppo. Both Syria and its Russian allies say shells carrying toxic gas injured about 100 people late on Saturday. State media showed images of Aleppo residents being treated in hospital as they struggled to breathe. The rebels deny carrying out a chemical strike and say the claims are a pretext for an attack on opposition-held areas. Parts of the Aleppo region, as well as the neighbouring provinces of Hama and Idlib, are controlled by Turkish-backed rebels and jihadists. The long-distance learners of Aleppo Aleppo family finds home in Wales On Sunday the Russian defence ministry said warplanes had launched strikes on ""the identified positions of terrorist artillery in the area that shelled civilians in the city of Aleppo"" the previous evening. It added that all ""militant"" targets had been ""destroyed"". There is no word on any casualties. Earlier, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based group that monitors the war via a network of activists on the ground, said about 100 people, including women and children, had been treated for breathing difficulties following a strike on western parts of Aleppo on Saturday. The Damascus government and Russia say rebels used chlorine gas in the attack. Why does the battle for Idlib matter? How chemical weapons have helped Assad Zaher Batal, the head of the Aleppo Doctors Syndicate, told Reuters news agency that it was the first gas attack against civilians in the city since the start of the conflict in 2011. But Abdel-Salam Abdel-Razak, an official from the Nour al-Din al-Zinki, an influential jihadist group in the area, dismissed the reports as ""purely a lie"", Reuters news agency reported. Western countries and the UN have accused government forces of using chemical and nerve agents on numerous occasions since the start of the civil war. There has been no major offensive in northern Syria since September, whenRussia and Turkey agreed to create a buffer zone to separate government forces from rebel fightersin Idlib province.

"An average of 137 women across the world are killed by a partner or family member every day, according to new data released by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). They say it makes ""the home the most likely place for a woman to be killed"". More than half of the 87,000 women killed in 2017 were reported as dying at the hands of those closest to them. Of that figure, approximately30,000 women were killed by an intimate partner,externaland another 20,000 by a relative. BBC 100 Womenwanted to find out more about the women behind the numbers. We spent October monitoring reports of gender-related killings of women on the first day of that month. We will share some of their stories below and find out more about how these killings were reported. The data collected by UNODC highlights that ""men are around four times more likely than women to lose their lives as a result of intentional homicide"". The UN indicates that men accounted for eight out of 10 homicide victims worldwide. However, the same report suggests that more than eight out of 10 victims of homicides committed by intimate partners are female. ""Intimate partner violence continues to take a disproportionately heavy toll on women,"" the report states. The UN statistics summarise the findings for 2017,externalbased on homicide statistics provided by government sources. The figures for ""gender-related killings of women and girls"", or ""femicide"", are collated using the criteria of intimate partner/family-related homicide. BBC 100 Women and BBC Monitoring set out to find out more about the women behind the numbers. We monitored press coverage of women killed by another person on 1 October 2018 around the world. Our regional specialists counted 47 women reported killed, apparently for gender-related reasons, in 21 different countries. Most of these killings are still being investigated.  Here are five of these cases, reported initially by local media and then verified by local authorities the BBC contacted. On Monday 1 October, Judith Chesang and her sister Nancy were out in the fields harvesting their sorghum crop. Judith, a mother of three, had recently separated from her husband, Laban Kamuren, and had decided to return to her parents' village in the north of the country. Soon after the sisters began their duties, he arrived at the family farm where he attacked and killed Judith. Local police say he has since been killed by villagers. Africa was where women ran the greatest risk of being killed by their intimate partner or family member, the UN report says. It occurred at a rate of 3.1 deaths per 100,000 people. Asia had the greatest number of women killed by intimate partners or family members in 2017, with a total of 20,000. Neha Sharad Chaudury died in a suspected ""honour"" killing on her 18th birthday. She had been out celebrating with her boyfriend. Police confirmed to the BBC that her parents did not approve of the relationship. Her parents and another male relative are accused of killing her in their home that evening. The investigation continues and the three remain in judicial custody awaiting trial. The BBC has learned from the lawyer representing Neha's parents and her male relative that they intend to deny the charges. Hundreds of people are killed each year for falling in love or marrying against their families' wishes. Official data on so-called honour killings is hard to come by as such crimes are often unrecorded or unreported. Zeinab Sekaanvan was executed by the Iranian authorities for murdering her husband. Zeinab was born in the north-west of Iran into a poor conservative family of Kurdish origin. She ran away as a teenager to marry in the hope of finding a better life. Amnesty International saysher husband was abusive and had refused to grant her a divorce,external, and that her complaints were ignored by police. She was arrested for the killing of her husband at the age of 17. Her supporters, including Amnesty, say she wastortured to confess to the killing of her husband, beaten by police and did not receive a fair trial,external. The UNODC report suggests women who kill intimate partners have often experienced ""extended periods of suffering physical violence"". Meanwhile, the motivations typically expressed by male perpetrators include ""possessiveness, jealousy and fear of abandonment"", the report says. This appears to be the case with another long-term couple who were found dead in Brazil on the same day that Zeinab was executed. Sandra Lucia Hammer Moura married Augusto Aguiar Ribeiro at the age of 16. The couple had been separated for five months when she was killed by him. Police in Jardim Taquari confirmed to BBC Brasil that she was stabbed in the neck. They found a video of her husband confessing to the crime on his mobile phone. In it, he said that Sandra was already dating another man and he felt betrayed. He also said in the video that he would not be arrested as the couple would go to the ""glory of the Lord"" together. He then hanged himself in what had been their bedroom. Sandra's case highlights a form of killing known as a ""murder-suicide"" - when an individual kills one or more people before killing themselves. BBC Monitoring found 14 cases of women killed on 1 October this year in Latin America. Two were in El Salvador. Authorities in El Salvador have told the BBC that at least 300 women have been killed so far in 2018. Karla Turcios is one of them. Watch her story here. This video can not be played Is El Salvador the worst country to be a woman? Marie-AmÃ©lie was stabbed to death by her husband, SÃ©bastien Vaillat. The couple had separated after four years of marriage. He attacked her with a knife before confessing to the police. A few days later, he killed himself in prison. Outside the door of Marie-AmÃ©lie Vaillat's lingerie shop on Rue Bichat, residents left a sea of flowers and organised a march in her memory. The killing of Marie-AmÃ©lie came onthe same day that the French government announced new plans to tackle domestic abuse,external. A march in memory of Marie-AmÃ©lie Vaillat To collect these stories, BBC Monitoring's international network of journalists and researchers analysed TV, radio, print, online and social media around the world, looking for reports of women killed, apparently for gender-related reasons, on 1 October 2018. They found a total of 47 reports of women killed on that one day around the world. We have shared just some of those cases. There are many more where the motives were unclear, or the perpetrators unidentified. The new UNODC report suggests that a large share of violence against women is ""widely underreported to authorities and that a large share of such violence is hidden"". Rebecca Skippage, who led the project for BBC Monitoring, found that behind the numbers, ""the way in which the media reported their lives and deaths revealed a huge amount about how women are viewed by different societies around the world"". She explains: ""We were looking for deaths within one day, but we searched for that day's stories for a month. We found that the time-lag in reporting, the tone of the coverage or the scarcity of information often told a wider tale about the status of women in that region."" Maryam Azwer works for BBC Monitoring and drew much of the final data together. ""This is as much about the deaths that aren't reported, as those that are,"" she says. ""Those whose stories never reached the media, that went unreported, were unverified, or were not or could not be investigated. It makes you wonder: what does it take to make a woman's killing important enough to be reported?"" Find out more about how BBC Monitoring carried out the research.

"EU leaders who gathered in Brussels put on a united front to back Theresa May's argument that the withdrawal agreement they endorsed was the ""best and only"" Brexit deal available. But there was no sense of celebration, and there were plenty of signs of how tough negotiations on the future EU-UK relationship are likely to be. Alongside the withdrawal agreement, and the political declaration on future ties, the remaining 27 EU leaders published a separate statement (without the UK) that vowed to protect their own interests, on a range of issues from fishing to fair competition to the rights of citizens. ""The European Council,"" it said, ""will demonstrate particular vigilance as regards safeguarding the rights and interests of citizens, the necessity to maintain ambitious level playing field conditions, and to protect fishing enterprises and coastal communities."" It emphasised in particular that a fisheries agreement that builds on ""existing reciprocal access and quota shares"" is a matter of priority. EU leaders still hope for fishing access 'Fairer share' of UK fish promised UK's Brexit deal agreed by EU leaders The statement was a clear sign that the UK will not have things all its own way, when it comes to balancing the competing demands of access to EU markets for UK fish produce, and access to UK fishing waters for EU boats. Several EU leaders highlighted fishing as a particularly sensitive issue. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said talks on fisheries were ""undoubtedly going to be an area where negotiations are going to be tough"". But the bluntest warning came from the French President Emmanuel Macron, who suggested that if the UK was unwilling to compromise in negotiations on fishing, which would need to make rapid progress, then talks on a wider trade deal would be slow. ""We as 27 have a clear position on fair competition, on fish, and on the subject of the EU's regulatory autonomy, and that forms part of our position for the future relationship talks,"" he said. The president implied that without sufficient progress on trade,the backstop planto avoid a hard border in Ireland would have to be implemented, including a temporary customs union for the whole of the UK. ""It is a lever because it is in our mutual interest to have this future relationship,"" Mr Macron said. ""I can't imagine that the desire of Theresa May or her supporters is to remain for the long term in a customs union, but (instead) to define a proper future relationship that resolves this problem."" This video can not be played Disputes over fishing aren't new. This was Reality Check's take earlier this year. It is a warning that the prime minister could have done without, as she seeks to appeal to the British public for support for her deal in advance of a vote in Parliament next month. But it is also a reminder - if any were needed - that other countries have domestic political concerns that will have to be taken into account. If anything, the negotiations on the future relationship - which can only begin formally after the UK has left the EU - will be even harder than the 18 months of negotiations that produced the withdrawal agreement which has just been endorsed.

"The Scottish National Party (SNP) has consistently voted against Theresa May's Brexit deal in Westminster. The party has also pushed the UK government to rule out leaving the European Union (EU) with no deal, arguing that such an outcome would have a ""severe and disproportionate"" impact on Scotland. So what is the SNP's Brexit policy? The Scottish government's ultimate objective, of course, is for an independent Scotland that is a full member of the European Union. If the UK ended up leaving the EU, which it is currently scheduled to do by 31 October, the SNP says it would seek a second referendum on Scottish independence by 2021. The party is strongly opposed to Brexit, and points out that Scotland voted ""overwhelmingly"" in favour of staying in the EU in the referendum -with the result 62% Remain and 38% Leave. Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has previously said that the 35 SNP MPs at Westminster would back any proposals for a confirmatory referendum on the Brexit terms - a so-called ""People's Vote"". But if the option to remain is not available, the SNP says it could not support any Brexit deal that does not include Scotland remaining a member of both the EU single market and customs union. It says this could be done either through a differentiated deal that would see Scotland stay in both when the rest of the UK leaves -or through its preferred option of the UK as a whole retaining full membership of them,external. So what would it mean in practice if the SNP's policy was adopted and the UK remained in the single market and customs union? Please upgrade your browser Under this version of Brexit, the UK would continue to have full access to the single market and very few trade barriers with the EU. That means there would be the same friction-free flow of goods to and from the remaining 27 member countries. The SNP says remaining in the single market would""protect jobs, living standards, our economy and public services"".,external But by remaining part of the customs union, the UK would not be allowed to negotiate its own free trade deals with countries outside the EU. The UK would also be tied to EU rules and regulations and it would have very little capacity to change them. That's because having left the EU, the UK would no longer have any MEPs or representation on the European Commission. Also, despite no longer being an EU member, the UK would have to abide by freedom of movement rules. So EU citizens would still be allowed to live and work in the UK and vice versa. Why is the backstop a big deal in Scotland? Brexit withdrawal agreement: what it all means Brexit: what is the Norway model? The UK would also have to continue to make a contribution to the EU budget, although the exact amount would be subject to negotiation. Currently, the UK pays about Â£10.8bn net a year. The UK would, though, be able to leave both the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) which would save money in EU budget contributions and allow the UK to set its own policy in these areas. But the more the UK restricts access for EU boats to UK fishing waters, the more the EU is likely to restrict access for UK fish produce to EU markets. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. At the moment, there is no country in Europe that is a member of both the single market and the customs union, but not part of the EU. So the SNP is arguing for an arrangement that would be unique. The closest equivalent would be Norway, which is not part of the EU, but is part of the single market, through its membership of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA). Theother EFTA members are Iceland, Liechtenstein and Switzerland.,external In order to continue to have access to the single market, the UK would need to formally apply to EFTA to become its fifth member. The EFTA has its own court, but it still needs to pay heed to European Court of Justice rulings when it comes to disputes involving EU law. But Norway is not part of the customs union, something which the SNP also wants the UK to retain. Mrs May has resisted any previous attempts to go along with a Norway-style Brexit model, arguing that it ""wouldn't deliver on the vote of the British people"". However, it would alleviate the problem of preventing a possible hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic - something for which negotiators on both sides are still trying to find a long-term solution. Speaking of Northern Ireland, the SNP is unhappy with the Irish ""backstop"" proposal contained in the draft withdrawal agreement which Theresa May has negotiated. The backstop would be triggered if the transition period expires without a new trade deal being ready in time. The SNP argues that if this happens, Northern Ireland will gain a competitive advantage over Scotland. That's because Northern Ireland would be in a deeper customs relationship with the EU, and it would be closer entwined with the rules of the single market than the rest of the UK. Ms Sturgeon says this would mean Northern Ireland businesses would get easier access to the single market, which she fears would have a ""devastating"" impact on Scottish jobs and investment. The SNP's argument is: if Northern Ireland can have such arrangements, why can't Scotland? The UK government's answer is that the backstop is needed to protect the Good Friday peace agreement and that Northern Ireland is in a unique situation, given it shares a physical border with an EU country. This amounts to another reason why the SNP favours continued membership of the customs union and the single market for the whole of the UK.

"The abandoned village has attracted huge numbers of sightseers Graffiti has been scratched on buildings and stones pulled from walls at a rarely seen abandoned village. ""Unprecedented"" numbers of visitors have flocked to Ladybower Reservoir in Derbyshire since low water levels revealed the ruins of Derwent. But park rangers say they have had to stop people trying to remove material from the site. The Peak District National Park authority said it was shocked by the damage to the ""iconic"" structures. Derwent was flooded in the 1940s to make way for Ladybower Reservoir, which was built between 1935 and 1943. But this year's long dry spring and summer hasreduced the water levels so low that remains of the village have been exposed, which had drawn crowds of people in recent weeks. This video can not be played Ladybower Reservoir's low water reveals 'drowned' village One visitor, Clare Whittaker from Sheffield, was left ""upset and mad"" when she saw both children and parents taking ""beautiful"" stones from the walls and throwing them into the mud. ""My Sunday visit to Ladybower left me very upset,"" she said. ""We're very lucky to get to see some good history but people were deliberately destroying that history."" Dr Steve Rowe, team leader of the Edale Mountain Rescue Team, said he had also seen vandalism at the site. ""There's a fair amount of graffiti and defacement on the ruins. It's a huge part of our history and now 'Cheryl' and 'Steve' have scratched their names in the rock. ""We need to look after it, we have a responsibility like you would at any historical site."" Stones taken from buildings and thrown into the mud at Ladybower A pump house from Derwent village has been exposed by the low water levels Anna Badcock, the park authority's cultural heritage manager, said: ""Whilst we understand that people are fascinated by the appearance of these usually hidden ruins, the structures remain an iconic archaeological feature of the Peak District National Park. ""As we wouldn't expect people to vandalise any of the National Park's many heritage buildings or other archaeological features, the remains of the homes and other submerged buildings are no exception. ""We urge people to leave these features intact to open a valuable window on to history, not just today, but for future generations to enjoy."" People are also being urged to look at the ruins of Derwent from the banks of the reservoir, rather than walking on the mud, which can be dangerous. Derwent before it was flooded to make way for Ladybower Reservoir Edale Mountain Rescue said they had already saved one man who was stuck up to his chest for almost two hours. Dr Rowe said: ""It's exciting and interesting; come and have a look but appreciate the risk. 'The first time I had sex I contracted HIV' Prince Harry and Meghan to move to Windsor Castle 'A wig makes you feel unstoppable' ""Visitor numbers are unprecedented at the moment. There are some areas of unstable mud - as someone said to me it's like walking on the skin of a rice pudding. ""You can see most of the stuff from the bank - we advise you stay there,"" he added.

"Hundreds gathered to watch Camborne's new Christmas tree get switched on A town has unveiled an ""amazing"" new Christmas tree after last year's fake one was dubbed ""the worst in Britain"". The ridiculed tree in Camborne, west Cornwall, did not even make it to the big day as it had to be removed when its star was stolen and wires exposed. Earlier, hundreds watched the switch on of a ""beautiful"" 25ft traditional spruce. Last year's cone-shaped tree,damaged at least 10 times, was described as ""absolutely rubbish"". Mocking around the Christmas tree - last year's effort was branded ""absolutely rubbish"" Organiser of this year's big switch-on, Sharron Lipscombe-Manley described the ""wonderful real tree"" as the centre piece of Christmas celebrations.

"Nigel Dodds was addressing the Democratic Unionist Party conference Thewithdrawal agreement approved by the UK and EU leadersis ""worse than no deal"", DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds has said. The DUP, which props up the government, has repeatedly said it will vote against it in Parliament. There has been political opposition to the plan because of the backstop, which aims to avoid a hard Irish border. But Sinn FÃ©in, which campaigned against Brexit, has described the deal as ""the least worst option"" on the table. A number of business and farming groups in NIhave also urged the DUP to support the dealand provide certainty. EU leaders agree Brexit deal Reality Check: Brexit withdrawal agreement - what it all means Live: Reaction as EU signs off Brexit deal Speaking to BBC 5 Live's Pienaar's Politics, Mr Dodds said his party's ""one red line"" had been ignored by the government. The agreement on the backstop would see only Northern Ireland stay aligned to some EU rules, if it took effect. The DUP is concerned that the backstop could threaten the integrity of the union and place a trade border down the Irish Sea. ""What Theresa may has succeeded in doing is putting a proposition on the table which is worse than no deal and worse than staying in the EU, whatever else is put on the table,"" said the North Belfast MP. ""The government is going to spend the next fortnight engaged in all sorts of project fear initiatives in order to try to get MPs to vote for something that is clearly unsatisfactory."" This video can not be played Speaking to Andrew Marr, Arlene Foster called on Theresa May to look for a ""better deal"". The DUP has repeatedly said it will vote against the deal, as it stands, when it comes to Parliament to be ratified in a few weeks' time. Mr Dodds said his party would not be ""bought off"", he said, adding that ""there is absolutely no way this deal can go through on the basis of side offers."" ""The DUP has been very clear all along - we have core beliefs and principles and we're sticking by those,"" he said. Mary Lou McDonald said the deal agreed by the UK and EU would not resolve her party's concerns about Brexit Sinn FÃ©in President Mary Lou McDonald backed the withdrawal deal, but said: ""The agreement endorsed today between the EU27 and the British government does not resolve Brexit. ""It is the least worst option - there is no good Brexit."" ""It must be clear that under no scenario will there be a hardening of the border in Ireland or the abandonment of the Good Friday Agreement, which we must all work to fully implement and defend,"" she added. Earlier, DUP leader Arlene Foster said her party is ""disappointed"" with Theresa May and the government's decision to press ahead with the Brexit deal. Mrs Foster said the the agreement ""goes against everything"" the DUP had been promised. Speaking onThe Andrew Marr Showon Sunday, Arlene Foster said: ""We're disappointed with the way this has progressed. ""She (Theresa May) is a unionist, but this deal goes against everything she has said about all of that."" Mrs Foster said there is still time to negotiate for a ""better deal"". The importance of being unionist? Business 'on brink of chaos' if no deal ""We should use the time now to look for a third way. I recognise we are negotiating with a fatigue, there comes a time when everybody is tired and just wants to get on with it but we shouldn't accept the outcome for the sake of it,"" she added. Several newspapers have reported that the DUP is involved in discussions with several cabinet ministers about a secret ""Brexit plan B"", if Mrs May's deal does not get passed in the Commons. Mrs Foster did not explicitly deny the report, but said her party was having ""conversations right across government"" about the deal. The Irish border was the trickiest issue in the Brexit withdrawal negotiations She also said she did not see any circumstances right now where Mrs May's deal would have enough support to get through parliament. The DUP holds the balance of power at Westminster, as the government relies on the votes of its 10 MPs to have a working majority in parliament. It signed a confidence and supply pact with the Conservatives in June 2017 and negotiated an extra Â£1bn in spending for Northern Ireland - but the rift between the parties over the Brexit plan has put the arrangement under significant pressure. Mrs Foster has already said if the government's deal gets passed in the Commons,the DUP will have to review the confidence and supply pact. ""We'll review it at that point in time: things are fluid, things change - we'll have to see where we are,"" she added. The government has insisted that it will not renegotiate the current plan, and has urged MPs to back it or risk a no deal scenario.

"This video can not be played Theresa May: ""I will make the case for this deal with all my heart"" EU leaders have approved an agreement on the UK's withdrawal and future relations - insisting it is the ""best and only deal possible"". After 20 months of negotiations, the 27 leaders gave the deal their blessing after less than an hour's discussion. They said the deal - which needs to be approved by the UK Parliament - paved the way for an ""orderly withdrawal"".

Mr Juncker said it was a ""sad day"" and no-one should be ""raising champagne glasses"" at the prospect of the UK leaving. While it was not his place to tell MPs how to vote, he said they should bear in mind that ""this is the best deal possible...this is the only deal possible"". His message was echoed by Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar who said ""any other deal really only exists in people's imagination"". But Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite suggested there were a number of possible outcomes if the UK Parliament rejected the deal, including an extension of the negotiations, or another referendum. By Laura Kuenssberg, BBC political editor It's a compromise. It was always going to be. It's not a happy compromise either. People on both sides of the Brexit argument are already screaming their protests. And although the prime minister must be relieved, she didn't exactly say that she was pleased about the deal when I asked her at a news conference this lunchtime. Instead, she said she was sure the country's best days are ahead. But however she really feels about it - and with this prime minister it is hard to tell - her strategy for the next couple of weeks is crystal clear. Her case? This is all there is. Read Laura's blog in full No member states raised objections to the Brexit withdrawal deal and it was approved in a matter of seconds, according to a senior EU official. Around seven leaders spoke in the session of the 27 member states, mostly to say this was a sad day and they wanted the future relationship with the UK to be as close as possible. After Mrs May's address, roughly half of the leaders spoke. Several wished her good luck with the meaningful vote in Parliament. No ""what ifs"" were discussed. This video can not be played Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt appealed to so-called ""Bobs"" - people who he said are ""bored of Brexit"" - to support the agreement Mrs May will now need to persuade MPs in the UK Parliament to back it. She is expected to spend the next fortnight travelling the country trying to sell the deal before a parliamentary vote in the second week of December. If MPs reject the deal, a number of things could happen - including leaving with no deal, an attempt to renegotiate or a general election. What happens if MPs reject Brexit deal? Taoiseach 'regrets' UK is leaving EU 'Wales less prosperous after Brexit deal' Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the parliamentary arithmetic was ""looking challenging"" and warned ""nothing could be ruled out"" if Mrs May lost the vote, including the government collapsing. He told the BBC's Andrew Marr that the UK was getting ""between 70% and 80%"" of what it wanted, while the agreement ""mitigated"" most of the negative economic impacts. Asked if the UK would be better off than if it stayed in, he said the country would not be ""significantly worse or better off but it does mean we get our independence back"". The agreement will also have to go back to the European Council, where a majority of countries (20 out of 27 states) will need to vote for it. It will also need to be ratified by the European Parliament, in a vote expected to take place in early 2019. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn responded to Sunday's summit by calling the deal ""the worst of all worlds"". He said his party would oppose it, but would work with others ""to block a no deal outcome"" and ensure ""a sensible deal"" was on the table. Former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith said he would find it ""very, very difficult"" to support the agreement as it stood. ""I don't believe that, so far, this deal delivers on what the British people really voted for,"" he told Sky's Sophy Ridge show. ""I think it has ceded too much control."" SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon - who wanted to stay in the EU -said it was a ""bad deal""and Parliament should consider ""better alternatives"", such as remaining in the single market and customs union permanently. And Democratic Unionist leader Arlene Foster - who wants to leave the EU -said her party's parliamentary pact with the Conservatives would be reviewedif MPs approved the deal. She told the BBC's Andrew Marr show the agreement as it stood would leave Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK ""still within European structures with no say in its rules"".

Scottish Secretary David Mundell has previously said he could not support any extension of CFP rules beyond 2020. Ms Sturgeon tweeted: ""I'll be interested to hear David Mundell explain how this - 'existing reciprocal access and quota shares' - can be squared with the promises made to the Scottish fishing industry. (Hint - it can't)."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Brexit deal has implications for the debate over Scottish independence and the future of fishing. The withdrawal agreement does not let Scottish Conservatives off the hook over the fishing industry. All 13 Scottish Tory MPs demanded exit from the common fisheries policy by 2020 and insisted ""access and quota shares cannot be included"" in the future economic partnership. Both the UK and EU say they'll use ""best endeavours"" to conclude a new fisheries agreement by 2020 but the EU has certainly not given up on keeping its current share of the UK catch. A statement agreed by the EU27 makes clear they will prioritise an agreement that builds on ""existing reciprocal access and quota shares"". In short, the fight over fishing is deferred. Read Glenn's analysis in full Mr Mundell later responded, saying any future deal on fishing had still to be agreed, and that the prime minister had made clear she would defend the UK's fishing interests robustly. He tweeted: ""The Prime Minister made clear earlier today, the UK will be an independent coastal state once again, in full sovereign control of our waters, able to decide for ourselves who we allow to fish in them, with that access not tied to any other aspect of our economic partnership."" Nicola Sturgeon has also criticised Theresa May's appeal to the public to get behind the Brexit deal. In a letter to the nation Mrs May has said leaving the EU next year would be ""a moment of renewal and reconciliation for our whole country"". The800-word messagesaid the UK would ""take back control"" of laws and money which, it suggested, could be spent on the NHS."" But Ms Sturgeon said that ""almost nothing in this desperate letter is true"". She said the UK Parliament should consider ""better alternatives"", such as remaining in the single market and customs union permanently - and she urged MPs to reject it. What is the SNP's position on Brexit? In Brussels, French president Emmanuel Macron stressed the importance his country placed on fishing in future talks. He said ""all of our fishermen will be protected"", with the French planning to ""defend access as part of the indispensable balance"". The Aberdeen South MP Ross Thomson, the only Scottish Tory who has so far said he will vote against the Brexit deal in the House of Commons, said the EU27 document was ""troubling"". He told the BBC's Sunday Politics Scotland: ""The arrangement that we have on fisheries has been devastating to fishing communities across Scotland and across the whole of the UK. ""It's in the interest of the EU to keep it going and they want to build on those existing arrangements, so to my mind that can only mean the continuation of some form of common fisheries policy. ""It may not be called that but if it looks like the CFP and behaves like the CFP, it is the CFP."" Mrs May, in her letter to the nation, insisted that the UK would become an independent coastal state with ""full control over our waters"". She wrote: ""We will be out of EU programmes that do not work in our interests: out of the Common Agricultural Policy that has failed our farmers, and out of the Common Fisheries Policy that has failed our coastal communities."" Labour, however, has written to Scottish Secretary David Mundell asking him to clarify his position in light of the EU document. Shadow Scottish Secretary  Lesley Laird wrote: ""I do not need to tell you that this is a clear breach of your red line on fishing. ""I would therefore be grateful if you were able to clarify that you will not be voting for the deal on this basis.

"Feeling a little lost on Brexit? Never really got your head around it in the first place? Let us walk you through it. Brexit is short for ""British exit"" - and is the word people use to talk about the United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union (EU). The EU is a political and economic union of 28 countries that trade with each other and allow citizens to move easily between the countries to live and work(click here if you want to see the full list).,external The UK joined the EU, then known as the EEC (European Economic Community), in 1973. A public vote - calleda referendum- was held on Thursday 23 June 2016 when voters were asked just one question - whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. TheLeave side won by nearly 52% to 48% - 17.4m votes to 16.1m- but the exit didn't happen straight away. It was due to take place on 29 March 2019 - but the departure date has been delayed (we will explain in more detail below). The 2016 vote was just the start. Since then, negotiations have been taking place between the UK and the other EU countries. The discussions have been mainly over the ""divorce"" deal, which sets out exactly how the UK leaves - not what will happen afterwards. This deal is known as theWithdrawal Agreement. The withdrawal agreement covers some of these key points: How much money the UK will have to pay the EU in order to break the partnership - that's about Â£39bn What will happen to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and, equally, what will happen to EU citizens living in the UK How to avoid the return of a physical border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland when it becomes the frontier between the UK and the EU This video can not be played Adam Fleming summarises the Brexit agreement in one minute(ish) It also includes atransition period,which has been agreed to allow the UK and EU to agree a trade deal and to give businesses the time to adjust. That means that if the withdrawal agreement gets the green light, there will be no huge changes between the date of Brexit and 31 December 2020. Click here for more on the draft withdrawal agreement Another, much shorter, document has also been drawn up that gives an overview of what the UK and EU's future relationship will be in the longer term. This is thepolitical declaration.However, neither side has to stick exactly to what it says - it is a set of ambitions for future talks. Click here for more on the political declaration The deal was agreed by the UK and the EU in November 2018, but it also has to be approved by British MPs. Well, no. They have voted against it three times. On 15 January they rejected the dealby 432 votes to 202- a record defeat. Then on 12 March, after Theresa May - the prime minister at the time - had gone back to the EU to secure further legal assurances,they rejected it again. And on 29 March - the original day that the UK was due to leave the EU -MPs rejected it for a third time(this vote was slightly different as it did not include the political declaration). Yes. As MPs did not approve Mrs May's withdrawal deal, she was forced to ask other EU leaders to delay Brexit. The deadline was delayed until 31 October- but, unable to see a way forward, Mrs May stepped down as PM and was replaced by Boris Johnson. There isa broad range of complaints, many of which claim the deal fails to give back to the UK control of its own affairs from the EU. One of the biggest sticking points has been over what happens at the Irish border. Both the EU and UK want to avoid the return of guard posts and checks (here's why), so something calledthe backstop- a sort of safety net - was included in the deal. The backstop is meant to be a last resort to keep an open border on the island of Ireland - whatever happens in the Brexit negotiations. It would mean that Northern Ireland, but not the rest of the UK, would still follow some EU rules on things such as food products. Theresa May insisted that, if all went as planned, it would never be used. Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop But it has annoyed some MPs, who are angry that the UK would not be able to end it without the EU's permission and so EU rules could remain in place for good. Other MPs would prefer the UK to stay closer to the EU - or even still in it. And others say Northern Ireland should not be treated separately from the rest of the UK. Boris Johnson has said he wants to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement with the EU - and remove the backstop. If he succeeds in doing this, it will still have to be approved by MPs before being passed into UK law. However, EU leaders have consistently said they will not renegotiate the withdrawal agreement and that the backstop is an essential part of any deal. If the prime minister fails to convince the EU to change the withdrawal agreement, he has promised to take the UK out of the EU without a deal on 31 October. Leaving the EU without a withdrawal agreement would be known as a ""no-deal Brexit"". New PM Boris Johnson has promised to take the UK out of the EU with or without a deal ""No deal"" means the UK will have failed to agree a withdrawal agreement. It would mean there would be no transition period after the UK leaves and EU laws would stop applying to the UK immediately(more on that here). The government says it is preparing for this potential situation. It expects some food prices could rise and customs checks at borders could cost businesses billions of pounds.(Read the government's report here),external. It has published a series of guides,external- which cover everything from mobile roaming on holiday to the impact on electricity supplies. Here is a list of10 ways you could be affectedby a no-deal Brexit. It is still written into law that the UK will be leaving, even though the deadline has shifted. The European Court of Justice has said the UK couldcancel Brexit altogether without the agreement of other nations- but few politicians publicly back this option.

"The Scottish National Party (SNP) has consistently voted against Theresa May's Brexit deal in Westminster. The party has also pushed the UK government to rule out leaving the European Union (EU) with no deal, arguing that such an outcome would have a ""severe and disproportionate"" impact on Scotland. So what is the SNP's Brexit policy? The Scottish government's ultimate objective, of course, is for an independent Scotland that is a full member of the European Union. If the UK ended up leaving the EU, which it is currently scheduled to do by 31 October, the SNP says it would seek a second referendum on Scottish independence by 2021. The party is strongly opposed to Brexit, and points out that Scotland voted ""overwhelmingly"" in favour of staying in the EU in the referendum -with the result 62% Remain and 38% Leave. Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has previously said that the 35 SNP MPs at Westminster would back any proposals for a confirmatory referendum on the Brexit terms - a so-called ""People's Vote"". But if the option to remain is not available, the SNP says it could not support any Brexit deal that does not include Scotland remaining a member of both the EU single market and customs union. It says this could be done either through a differentiated deal that would see Scotland stay in both when the rest of the UK leaves -or through its preferred option of the UK as a whole retaining full membership of them,external. So what would it mean in practice if the SNP's policy was adopted and the UK remained in the single market and customs union? Please upgrade your browser Under this version of Brexit, the UK would continue to have full access to the single market and very few trade barriers with the EU. That means there would be the same friction-free flow of goods to and from the remaining 27 member countries. The SNP says remaining in the single market would""protect jobs, living standards, our economy and public services"".,external But by remaining part of the customs union, the UK would not be allowed to negotiate its own free trade deals with countries outside the EU. The UK would also be tied to EU rules and regulations and it would have very little capacity to change them. That's because having left the EU, the UK would no longer have any MEPs or representation on the European Commission. Also, despite no longer being an EU member, the UK would have to abide by freedom of movement rules. So EU citizens would still be allowed to live and work in the UK and vice versa. Why is the backstop a big deal in Scotland? Brexit withdrawal agreement: what it all means Brexit: what is the Norway model? The UK would also have to continue to make a contribution to the EU budget, although the exact amount would be subject to negotiation. Currently, the UK pays about Â£10.8bn net a year. The UK would, though, be able to leave both the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) which would save money in EU budget contributions and allow the UK to set its own policy in these areas. But the more the UK restricts access for EU boats to UK fishing waters, the more the EU is likely to restrict access for UK fish produce to EU markets. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. At the moment, there is no country in Europe that is a member of both the single market and the customs union, but not part of the EU. So the SNP is arguing for an arrangement that would be unique. The closest equivalent would be Norway, which is not part of the EU, but is part of the single market, through its membership of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA). Theother EFTA members are Iceland, Liechtenstein and Switzerland.,external In order to continue to have access to the single market, the UK would need to formally apply to EFTA to become its fifth member. The EFTA has its own court, but it still needs to pay heed to European Court of Justice rulings when it comes to disputes involving EU law. But Norway is not part of the customs union, something which the SNP also wants the UK to retain. Mrs May has resisted any previous attempts to go along with a Norway-style Brexit model, arguing that it ""wouldn't deliver on the vote of the British people"". However, it would alleviate the problem of preventing a possible hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic - something for which negotiators on both sides are still trying to find a long-term solution. Speaking of Northern Ireland, the SNP is unhappy with the Irish ""backstop"" proposal contained in the draft withdrawal agreement which Theresa May has negotiated. The backstop would be triggered if the transition period expires without a new trade deal being ready in time. The SNP argues that if this happens, Northern Ireland will gain a competitive advantage over Scotland. That's because Northern Ireland would be in a deeper customs relationship with the EU, and it would be closer entwined with the rules of the single market than the rest of the UK. Ms Sturgeon says this would mean Northern Ireland businesses would get easier access to the single market, which she fears would have a ""devastating"" impact on Scottish jobs and investment. The SNP's argument is: if Northern Ireland can have such arrangements, why can't Scotland? The UK government's answer is that the backstop is needed to protect the Good Friday peace agreement and that Northern Ireland is in a unique situation, given it shares a physical border with an EU country. This amounts to another reason why the SNP favours continued membership of the customs union and the single market for the whole of the UK.

"Now the Brexit deal has been signed off in Brussels, attention turns to Westminster. MPs will get their say on whether they approve of the deal or not. Several days of debate will be followed by what's known as the ""meaningful vote"". This is expected to take place in the week beginning 10 December. Any attempt to work out the parliamentary arithmetic can only be an estimate so all numbers should be treated with caution. As things stand, though, there seems to be a majority against the proposed deal. What happens if MPs reject Brexit deal? Who has written no confidence letters? A guide to where we are with Brexit Theresa May relies on the 10 Democratic Unionist Party MPs for her majority in the House of Commons. Their opposition to the proposed deal alone could make winning the vote tricky but the prime minister's problems don't end there. Some 57 Conservative MPs have signed up to the StandUp4Brexit campaign which argues that the proposed deal leaves the UK too close to the EU. (That includes Charlie Elphicke who is currently suspended from the party but generally votes with the government.) Added to those are the seven pro-Brexit MPs who resigned from government or party jobs on 15 November. And several more who have publicly stated they are opposed to the deal. Then there are, perhaps, a further dozen or so Conservative MPs from the Remain wing of the party who support the People's Vote campaign for another referendum or would like a closer relationship with the EU. All in all, there are around 80-90 Tories currently set to defy the government. Some of them have only said they can't support the deal which, perhaps, suggests, they might abstain when it comes to the crucial vote. But others are more hardline. On the other side of the calculation, there are a handful of pro-Brexit Labour MPs who might back the deal. And a further group who could vote for it to stop the possible alternative of a ""no deal"" Brexit. There's also one Liberal Democrat MP, Stephen Lloyd, who says he'll vote in favour of the deal to fulfil a pledge he made to his constituents. As things stand, though, this group isn't big enough to outweigh the DUP and Conservative rebels. Things can change of course. Mrs May will hope to persuade some of the rebels and more opposition MPs. But she has a long way to go.

"This video can not be played Magec rods were fitted into Anthony's back, but snapped A new therapy for children with curved spines was approved for general use after tests only on pigs and dead bodies, an investigation has revealed. Magec rods are supposed to help straighten the spine. But experts say the rods appear to snap too easily and say they are ""very surprised"" at how little evidence was needed to get them approved. The manufacturers Nuvasive said there was always risk in treating scoliosis and Magec had rebuilt families' lives. BBC Panorama has been working with theInternational Consortium of Investigative Journalists,externaland 58 media organisations around the world includingThe Guardian,externalnewspaper and theBritish Medical Journal,external. Anthony Wainess, from California in the US, had a severely twisted and curved spine from the disease scoliosis. ""All the time I bend down it's like a shark's fin at the back,"" he said back when he was nine and before having treatment. Patients given potentially dangerous implants The standard treatment would have involved surgery to insert metal rods around the spine to straighten it. But the rods need to be lengthened as children grow, which means operations every six months. Magec rods and magnetic remote adjuster (L), from a promotional video, and an X-ray of a curved spine then partially straightened by the rods Anthony was given Magec rods in 2013. They are marketed as a safer and cheaper alternative because they can be lengthened with magnets while still in the body. Anthony's dad Steven did not want his son to have to face repeat operations to lengthen the rods in his spine and Magec rods seemed ideal. But a year after they were fitted, one of the rods snapped inside him. The rods were replaced, but a year later they snapped again and had to be permanently removed. Steven said: ""It was a very low point for me. And it made me wonder just how good was it to have these Magec rods in to begin with? Did we make a mistake?"" The inventors got them approved for use across Europe via Germany - five years before the US - after studies on pigs and dead bodies. In the UK, the rodswere recommended by NICE,external, the body that decides best practice for the National Health Service, in 2014 based on ""limited"" evidence from a ""small"" studies in patients. But before long, surgeons in the north-east of England began to raise concerns. Mike Gibson, a consultant spinal surgeon at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle and a former president of the British Scoliosis Society, has put the rods into 10 children. But he does not think they work properly. ""When NICE turned around and said that it should be your implant of choice, I was frankly staggered,"" he said. Initially he gave rods he removed to the manufacturer, Nuvasive, to analyse, but heard nothing back. So he sent rods to engineers at Newcastle University, led by Prof Tom Joyce, who found titanium metal debris had been leaking into children's spines. The rods were analysed by engineers at Newcastle University Prof Joyce says nobody knows how the titanium might affect the children: ""There's a big question mark there. What are the long term effects of this?"" The Newcastle team has analysed 100 rods. Around 80 of them did not work as they should including problems lengthening. Mr Gibson also thinks the rods become more vulnerable to breaking as they extend. He questions why they were ever approved: ""It's very surprising they needed so little data,"" he says. The UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said it could not comment on the safety and effectiveness of specific devices because of issues around confidentiality. Graeme Tunbridge, a senior figure at the regulator, said: ""It's important to remember that before any implant is put into anyone, there's a decision making process and there's a discussion between a clinician and a patient to understand the risks involved in that."" NICE says the decision to recommend Magec was taken after careful consideration of the clinical and economic evidence and that the company has not highlighted any safety issues to them. The manufacturer Nuvasive says Magec rods have been shown to be effective and that they avoid the pain and complications of the regular operations required by conventional treatment. ""We see every day the challenges brought on by early-onset scoliosis and, while no technology in these patients is without risk, we have also seen Magec rebuild patient and family lives.""

"The Ukrainian navy accuses Russia of ramming and damaging one of its tugs Ukraine has accused Russia of ramming one of its boats off the coast of the annexed Crimea, amid rising tensions. The ""aggressive actions"" occurred as three Ukrainian ships sailed from the Black Sea port of Odessa to Mariupol in the Sea of Azov, Kiev said. Russia said the Ukrainian vessels were in its waters and blocked access to the Sea of Azov with a tanker. The Ukrainian navy later said the Russians opened fire on one of its ships and wounded a crew member. There has been no response from Russia on the allegation. Tensions have risen in the seas off the Crimean peninsula - annexed by Russia in 2014 - in recent months. Eastern Ukraine: A new, bloody chapter Ukraine names Russia as 'aggressor' state The Ukrainian navy said in a statement that its boats - two gunboats and the tug - were being monitored by two Russian helicopters scrambled by Moscow. Two Russian fighter jets were also seen flying low over the huge arch of the bridge, which Russia constructed earlier this year. A tanker under the bridge shut all navigation from and into the Sea of Azov The Ukrainian navy said the boats were waiting to cross into the Sea of Azov through the Kerch Strait, which Russia had shut off. A tanker was placed under the Russian-built bridge that spans the narrow Kerch Strait - the only access to the sea. Russia said the traffic was suspended for security reasons. Meanwhile, a Russian FSB security service official was quoted by Ria Novosti news agency as saying that Ukraine had sent naval reinforcements to the area. Russia earlier said the Ukrainian vessels - two small warships named as the Berdyansk and the Nikopol, and the tug - were trying ""to create a conflict situation in this region"" after they left Odessa. The ships ""illegally entered a temporarily closed area of Russian territorial waters"", the FSB reportedly said in a statement. But Ukraine said it had informed the Russians of its plan to move its ships through the sea to Mariupol. The navy statement said the Russian actions marked a breach of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. In recent weeks, a Ukrainian vessel was escorted by Russian tugs under the bridge in the Kerch Strait without an incident. The shallow Sea of Azov lies east of Crimea, and south of the Ukrainian regions partially seized by pro-Russian separatists. In 2003, Ukraine and Russia signed a treaty on the Sea of Azov, which defined it as internal waters of the two countries. The treaty guaranteed free navigation to all Ukrainian and Russian vessels. This video can not be played Jonah Fisher talks to a commander of the Ukrainian Navy about the tensions in the Azov Sea But Russia has recently increased its military presence and begun inspecting all vessels going to or from Ukrainian ports, with some calling Moscow's actions an ""economic blockade"". Earlier this month, the EU warned it would take ""targeted measures"" to address the issue. ""The situation in the Sea of Azov is damaging not only the Ukrainian economy, but also so many vessels that are flying the European Union member states' flags,"" EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said. The Russian inspections began soon after Ukraine detained a fishing vessel from Russian-annexed Crimea in March. Moscow also says the inspections of the vessels are necessary for security reasons, pointing to a potential threat to the bridge from Ukrainian radicals. The government in Kiev has repeatedly stated that the construction of the bridge was illegal. More than 10,000 people have been killed in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk region since separatists moved against the Ukrainian state in April 2014. Ukraine and the West accuse Russia of sending its troops to the region and arming the separatists. Moscow denies this, but admits that Russian ""volunteers"" are helping the rebels.

"A cache of Facebook documents has been seized by MPs investigating the Cambridge Analytica data scandal. Rarely used parliamentary powers were used to demand that the boss of a US software firm hand over the details. The Observer,which first reported the story,external, said the documents included data about Facebook's privacy controls. MP Damian Collins later told the BBC that he believed the documents were ""highly relevant"" to his inquiry. Facebook has demanded their return. The documents were intercepted when an executive of US tech firm Six4Three was on a trip to London. In a highly unusual move the House of Commons serjeant-at-arms was sent to the businessman's hotel and he was given a final warning and a two-hour deadline to comply with the order. When the executive failed to do so he was escorted to Parliament and warned he risked fines and imprisonment if the documents were not surrendered, the paper said. The firm is involved in court action against Facebook in the US, where the documents were obtained through legal procedures. Facebook v Soros: 'Congress must probe' Facebook appeals Cambridge Analytica fine Facebook treated voters with 'disrespect' Facebook told the Observer: ""The materials obtained by the DCMS committee are subject to a protective order of the San Mateo Superior Court restricting their disclosure. ""We have asked the DCMS committee to refrain from reviewing them and to return them to counsel or to Facebook."" But Damian Collins, chairman of the Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) Committee, said he believes the documents - which include emails - contain important information about how Facebook and other parties handle user data. He said he had written to Facebook stressing the House of Commons had powers to seize documents within UK jurisdiction. In his email to Facebook public policy vice president Richard Allen, which he posted on Twitter on Sunday evening, Mr Collins said a committee of the House can publish these documents under parliamentary privilege.

In an email to Mr Collins, also shared on Twitter, Mr Allen said that Six4Three's case against Facebook was ""entirely without merit"" and should not be taken at ""face value"". ""We hope you will want to reflect on the core issue behind the complaint... The case being brought by Six4Three is a challenge against our efforts to restrict access to data by apps in 2014/2015. ""On earlier occasions, your committee appeared to endorse this more restrictive approach. If this has now changed, it would be useful to understand why,"" he wrote. Mr Allan is due to appear before a DCMS committee hearing on Tuesday where details from the documents could be made public. Facebook and its founder Mark Zuckerberg have faced intense pressure over the social media giant's use of personal data, the spread of fake news, and, this month, allegations that it hired a PR firm to make claims about the financier George Soros. Last month the UK data watchdog fined Facebook Â£500,000 following its investigation into the Cambridge Analytica affair. Facebook has appealed against the fine, claiming that the watchdog found no evidence that UK users' personal data had been shared inappropriately and the penalty was therefore unjustified. The Cambridge Analytica scandal stems from the discovery that an academic at the University of Cambridge - Dr Aleksandr Kogan - used a personality quiz to harvest up to 87 million Facebook users' details. Some of this was subsequently shared with the political consultancy Cambridge Analytica, which used it to target political advertising in the US. It was initially reportedthat about 1.1 million UK-based users had had their details exposed.

The North's leader, Kim Jong-un, sent the two dogs to his counterpart Moon Jae-in in a bid to promote peace amid thawing ties on the Korean peninsula. Gomi, a Pungsan hunting dog, gave birth to three female and three male puppies. President Moon shared photos of the dogs on the official Blue House twitter feed on Sunday. ""As the pregnancy period of dogs is about two months, Gomi must have come to us pregnant,"" he reportedly tweeted when the pups were born. ""I hope inter-Korean affairs will be like this.""

"The talking in Brussels is done. After nearly two years of negotiations, arguments - and the inevitable moments where it felt like the process would explode - there is, now, a deal. It's a compromise. It was always going to be. It's not a happy compromise either. People on both sides of the Brexit argument are already screaming their protests. And although the prime minister must be relieved, she didn't exactly say that she was pleased about the deal when I asked her at a news conference this lunchtime. Instead, she said she was sure the country's best days are ahead. But however she really feels about it - and with this prime minister it is hard to tell - her strategy for the next couple of weeks is crystal clear. Her case? This is all there is. UK's Brexit deal agreed by EU leaders Brexit deal 'worse than no deal' - DUP Theresa May's 'letter to the nation' in full With the explicit backing of almost every European leader who has opened their mouth today, this is the ""only deal"", the ""best possible deal"", ""the max"". The message to MPs from Theresa May and her counterparts: don't kid yourselves if you think something else might magically appear if you vote it down. And the message to the public? Just let me get on with it, then we can all stop talking about Brexit - please. Again today she used the platform to ""talk directly to the British public"", to explain how her (now rather pink) red lines, on ""money, laws and borders"", have been followed. It's her Brexit with caveats, with a lot to be sorted out about the future, in the future.You can remind yourself what's actually in the deal here. And No 10 is all too aware that dozens and dozens of their own MPs hate it. Theresa May has reached her imperfect compromise at a moment when in Parliament both sides are hardening against the idea of compromising at all. What happens if MPs reject Brexit deal? Brexit: All you need to know 'Wales less prosperous after Brexit deal' For two years Theresa May has survived by tacking one way, then another. But now the deal is on paper, in black and white, that approach can't go on. A senior government figure said privately that No 10 was past the point of trying to please everyone. And of course, everyone in government is all too aware that it is likely that the deal will be rejected by Parliament in any case. But the only potential route through for the prime minister is through the middle, to look like, as one senior Whitehall official describes it, ""the adult in a world of children"". However the prime minister looks, however she sounds in the next fortnight, the levels of unhappiness at home are so profound that her pleas may fall on deaf ears. If the deal falls, she - and her government - may fall with it. Scrape it through then she'll have pulled off a feat far harder than getting the actual deal done. PS: Here's a great explanation from my colleague Ben Wright about what might happen if the vote, which we expect on 12 December, doesn't pass the deal.

"Feeling a little lost on Brexit? Never really got your head around it in the first place? Let us walk you through it. Brexit is short for ""British exit"" - and is the word people use to talk about the United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union (EU). The EU is a political and economic union of 28 countries that trade with each other and allow citizens to move easily between the countries to live and work(click here if you want to see the full list).,external The UK joined the EU, then known as the EEC (European Economic Community), in 1973. A public vote - calleda referendum- was held on Thursday 23 June 2016 when voters were asked just one question - whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. TheLeave side won by nearly 52% to 48% - 17.4m votes to 16.1m- but the exit didn't happen straight away. It was due to take place on 29 March 2019 - but the departure date has been delayed (we will explain in more detail below). The 2016 vote was just the start. Since then, negotiations have been taking place between the UK and the other EU countries. The discussions have been mainly over the ""divorce"" deal, which sets out exactly how the UK leaves - not what will happen afterwards. This deal is known as theWithdrawal Agreement. The withdrawal agreement covers some of these key points: How much money the UK will have to pay the EU in order to break the partnership - that's about Â£39bn What will happen to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and, equally, what will happen to EU citizens living in the UK How to avoid the return of a physical border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland when it becomes the frontier between the UK and the EU This video can not be played Adam Fleming summarises the Brexit agreement in one minute(ish) It also includes atransition period,which has been agreed to allow the UK and EU to agree a trade deal and to give businesses the time to adjust. That means that if the withdrawal agreement gets the green light, there will be no huge changes between the date of Brexit and 31 December 2020. Click here for more on the draft withdrawal agreement Another, much shorter, document has also been drawn up that gives an overview of what the UK and EU's future relationship will be in the longer term. This is thepolitical declaration.However, neither side has to stick exactly to what it says - it is a set of ambitions for future talks. Click here for more on the political declaration The deal was agreed by the UK and the EU in November 2018, but it also has to be approved by British MPs. Well, no. They have voted against it three times. On 15 January they rejected the dealby 432 votes to 202- a record defeat. Then on 12 March, after Theresa May - the prime minister at the time - had gone back to the EU to secure further legal assurances,they rejected it again. And on 29 March - the original day that the UK was due to leave the EU -MPs rejected it for a third time(this vote was slightly different as it did not include the political declaration). Yes. As MPs did not approve Mrs May's withdrawal deal, she was forced to ask other EU leaders to delay Brexit. The deadline was delayed until 31 October- but, unable to see a way forward, Mrs May stepped down as PM and was replaced by Boris Johnson. There isa broad range of complaints, many of which claim the deal fails to give back to the UK control of its own affairs from the EU. One of the biggest sticking points has been over what happens at the Irish border. Both the EU and UK want to avoid the return of guard posts and checks (here's why), so something calledthe backstop- a sort of safety net - was included in the deal. The backstop is meant to be a last resort to keep an open border on the island of Ireland - whatever happens in the Brexit negotiations. It would mean that Northern Ireland, but not the rest of the UK, would still follow some EU rules on things such as food products. Theresa May insisted that, if all went as planned, it would never be used. Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop But it has annoyed some MPs, who are angry that the UK would not be able to end it without the EU's permission and so EU rules could remain in place for good. Other MPs would prefer the UK to stay closer to the EU - or even still in it. And others say Northern Ireland should not be treated separately from the rest of the UK. Boris Johnson has said he wants to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement with the EU - and remove the backstop. If he succeeds in doing this, it will still have to be approved by MPs before being passed into UK law. However, EU leaders have consistently said they will not renegotiate the withdrawal agreement and that the backstop is an essential part of any deal. If the prime minister fails to convince the EU to change the withdrawal agreement, he has promised to take the UK out of the EU without a deal on 31 October. Leaving the EU without a withdrawal agreement would be known as a ""no-deal Brexit"". New PM Boris Johnson has promised to take the UK out of the EU with or without a deal ""No deal"" means the UK will have failed to agree a withdrawal agreement. It would mean there would be no transition period after the UK leaves and EU laws would stop applying to the UK immediately(more on that here). The government says it is preparing for this potential situation. It expects some food prices could rise and customs checks at borders could cost businesses billions of pounds.(Read the government's report here),external. It has published a series of guides,external- which cover everything from mobile roaming on holiday to the impact on electricity supplies. Here is a list of10 ways you could be affectedby a no-deal Brexit. It is still written into law that the UK will be leaving, even though the deadline has shifted. The European Court of Justice has said the UK couldcancel Brexit altogether without the agreement of other nations- but few politicians publicly back this option.

"The Scottish National Party (SNP) has consistently voted against Theresa May's Brexit deal in Westminster. The party has also pushed the UK government to rule out leaving the European Union (EU) with no deal, arguing that such an outcome would have a ""severe and disproportionate"" impact on Scotland. So what is the SNP's Brexit policy? The Scottish government's ultimate objective, of course, is for an independent Scotland that is a full member of the European Union. If the UK ended up leaving the EU, which it is currently scheduled to do by 31 October, the SNP says it would seek a second referendum on Scottish independence by 2021. The party is strongly opposed to Brexit, and points out that Scotland voted ""overwhelmingly"" in favour of staying in the EU in the referendum -with the result 62% Remain and 38% Leave. Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has previously said that the 35 SNP MPs at Westminster would back any proposals for a confirmatory referendum on the Brexit terms - a so-called ""People's Vote"". But if the option to remain is not available, the SNP says it could not support any Brexit deal that does not include Scotland remaining a member of both the EU single market and customs union. It says this could be done either through a differentiated deal that would see Scotland stay in both when the rest of the UK leaves -or through its preferred option of the UK as a whole retaining full membership of them,external. So what would it mean in practice if the SNP's policy was adopted and the UK remained in the single market and customs union? Please upgrade your browser Under this version of Brexit, the UK would continue to have full access to the single market and very few trade barriers with the EU. That means there would be the same friction-free flow of goods to and from the remaining 27 member countries. The SNP says remaining in the single market would""protect jobs, living standards, our economy and public services"".,external But by remaining part of the customs union, the UK would not be allowed to negotiate its own free trade deals with countries outside the EU. The UK would also be tied to EU rules and regulations and it would have very little capacity to change them. That's because having left the EU, the UK would no longer have any MEPs or representation on the European Commission. Also, despite no longer being an EU member, the UK would have to abide by freedom of movement rules. So EU citizens would still be allowed to live and work in the UK and vice versa. Why is the backstop a big deal in Scotland? Brexit withdrawal agreement: what it all means Brexit: what is the Norway model? The UK would also have to continue to make a contribution to the EU budget, although the exact amount would be subject to negotiation. Currently, the UK pays about Â£10.8bn net a year. The UK would, though, be able to leave both the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) which would save money in EU budget contributions and allow the UK to set its own policy in these areas. But the more the UK restricts access for EU boats to UK fishing waters, the more the EU is likely to restrict access for UK fish produce to EU markets. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. At the moment, there is no country in Europe that is a member of both the single market and the customs union, but not part of the EU. So the SNP is arguing for an arrangement that would be unique. The closest equivalent would be Norway, which is not part of the EU, but is part of the single market, through its membership of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA). Theother EFTA members are Iceland, Liechtenstein and Switzerland.,external In order to continue to have access to the single market, the UK would need to formally apply to EFTA to become its fifth member. The EFTA has its own court, but it still needs to pay heed to European Court of Justice rulings when it comes to disputes involving EU law. But Norway is not part of the customs union, something which the SNP also wants the UK to retain. Mrs May has resisted any previous attempts to go along with a Norway-style Brexit model, arguing that it ""wouldn't deliver on the vote of the British people"". However, it would alleviate the problem of preventing a possible hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic - something for which negotiators on both sides are still trying to find a long-term solution. Speaking of Northern Ireland, the SNP is unhappy with the Irish ""backstop"" proposal contained in the draft withdrawal agreement which Theresa May has negotiated. The backstop would be triggered if the transition period expires without a new trade deal being ready in time. The SNP argues that if this happens, Northern Ireland will gain a competitive advantage over Scotland. That's because Northern Ireland would be in a deeper customs relationship with the EU, and it would be closer entwined with the rules of the single market than the rest of the UK. Ms Sturgeon says this would mean Northern Ireland businesses would get easier access to the single market, which she fears would have a ""devastating"" impact on Scottish jobs and investment. The SNP's argument is: if Northern Ireland can have such arrangements, why can't Scotland? The UK government's answer is that the backstop is needed to protect the Good Friday peace agreement and that Northern Ireland is in a unique situation, given it shares a physical border with an EU country. This amounts to another reason why the SNP favours continued membership of the customs union and the single market for the whole of the UK.

"The European Union has endorsed the Brexit deal after 18 months of negotiations 'This is the best deal possible, this is the only deal possible,' says European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker Theresa May says it allows the country to 'move forward together into a brighter future' But the UK Parliament must also approve the deal - MPs are expected to vote in December A number of MPs from all sides have criticised the agreement Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt says the parliamentary arithmetic is 'challenging' Laurence Peter and Robbie Hawkins A European Union summit in Brusselshas backed the Brexit dealreached between the UK and EU. It took leaders just 40 minutes to endorse nearly 600 pages of legal text and a 20-page roadmap for the EU's future relationship with Britain. Calling it a sad day, the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker,  said that it was the ""best"" and ""only deal possible"". He warned that if British MPs thought they could get a better one next month by voting against the current offer, they would be disappointed. Prime Minister Theresa May said the deal ""delivered for the British people"" and set the UK ""on course for a prosperous future"", urging both Leave and Remain voters to get behind the agreement. Focus now returns to Westminster, with the deal expected to be put to MPs in the House of Commons before Christmas. Approval is far from guaranteed, with Labour, the Lib Dems, the SNP, the DUP and many Conservatives MPsall set to vote against it. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned ""nothing could be ruled out"" if Mrs May loses the vote - including the government collapsing. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said however the PM really feels about this deal, her strategy for the next couple of weeks is crystal clear. Her case? This is all there is.

That was the message from the SNP's leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford, to Theresa May at Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday. Mrs May responded by saying such a Brexit outcome would ""frustrate the vote of the British people"". But what is the SNP's Brexit policy and what would it mean? Read the full BBC Reality Check piecehere. The EU leaders have approved the two key Brexit documents: There was no formal vote on Sunday, with the EU proceeding by consensus. There's more relief among businesses about today's agreement - and a warning to MPs. The head of the EEF manufacturing group, Stephen Phipson, said the uncertainty had hit firms ""particularly hard"", with investment delayed, jobs lost and growth hit. ""Todayâs agreement finally
provides a clear pathway to a stable and sensible transition from full membership
of the EU and avoids the horrific consequences of leaving without a deal,"" he said. Which is why, he added, MPs should take note as the vote in Parliament approaches. ""I
would strongly advise all MPs to look closely at this deal, the consequences of
the alternative and make a pragmatic decision that provides our economy
and business with the clarity and certainty we need,"" he said. Politicians in Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrat (CDU) party welcomed today's deal with the UK, while criticising Brexit itself. Quoted by Sueddeutsche Zeitung (in German),external, CDU parliamentary deputy leader Katja Leikert said it was ""the best possible result under very difficult circumstances"". ""There could be no perfect solution for Brexit, which is a fundamentally wrong decision, in our opinion."" A leading CDU MEP, David McAllister, called Brexit ""an historic mistake with heavy consequences for the UK"". Social Democrat (SPD) politician Christian Petry said the Brexit deal ""enables an orderly withdrawal"" for the UK. But the Greens' Europe spokeswoman Franziska Brantner called the deal ""far too weak"" on the environment and social welfare. She warned there was a risk of the UK undermining EU standards in those areas.  Toyota, which has a huge car plant near Derby, said it was now important for the UK and EU to press on and secure free and frictionless trade deal. The Japanese giant, which warned about the uncertainty around Brexit, said the agreement should ""avoid
the significant production disruption a âNo Dealâ outcome would have for âJust
in Timeâ supply chains in the automotive industry"". A Toyota statement added: âWe
appreciate that these have been challenging negotiations."" This video can not be played Brexit: 'I'm never changing my mind' says Juncker Adam FlemingBrussels reporter No member states raised objections
to the Brexit withdrawal deal and it was approved in a matter of seconds, a senior EU official told BBC Brussels reporter Adam Fleming. Around seven leaders spoke in the
session of the EU27, mostly to say that it was a sad day and
that they wanted the future relationship with the UK to be as close as possible. After Theresa Mayâs address,
roughly half of the leaders spoke. Several wished her good luck with the ""meaningful"" vote yet to come in Parliament. The senior official wouldnât
confirm or deny whether Mrs May had conceded privately that she
didnât have a majority for her deal in Parliament, but said no ""what ifs"" were discussed. The EUâs only Plan B was its
existing contingency planning, the official said. President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker insists that the deal reached between the UK and EU ""isthedeal"". ""I'm never changing my mind"", he told BBC Europe Editor Katya Adler. ""This is the best deal possible, this is the only deal possible."" As a result, if MPs were to reject the deal when it is put to the House of Commons, ""we would have no deal"". Brexit was not the result of a failure by the EU, he added, ""it's the responsibility of Britain"". ""You are telling people year after year, month after month, day after day, that the membership of the European Union is a bad thing for British citizens, so I don't think the European Union is guilty for the result.""

Shadow Scotland secretary Lesley Laird has written to David Mundell, calling on him to clarify his position on the withdrawal deal. The deal, she says, ""is a clear breach of your red line on fishing"", with some concerned there is insufficient clarity that the UK will not remain part of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) after Brexit. Secretary of State for Scotland David Mundell previously threatened to quit Theresa May's Cabinet if UK participation in the CFP continued beyond 2020.

All 13 Scottish Conservative MPs - including Scottish Secretary David Mundell - threatened mutiny earlier this month unless the Brexit deal ensured the UK left the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). The CFP is the shared fisheries policy of the European Union, which sets quotas for the amount of fish countries are allowed to catch, as well as controlling what kind of fish are caught and where. The policy is deeply unpopular with fishing crews across the UK. Read more here about the impactof Brexit on the UK's fisheries. Scottish Conservative MP Ross Thomson has called the EU position on a future fisheries agreement with the UK ""deeply troubling"". Mr Thomson, who says he intends to vote against Theresa May's deal, says the EU have made clear in adocument published today,externalthat they want to maintain the unpopular Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). ""The current arrangement is very good for the EU, the arrangement we have on fisheries has been devastating for fishing communities across Scotland and the UK"", he says. ""It's in the interests of the EU to keep it going...It may not be called that, but if  it looks like the CFP and  behaves like the CFP then it is the CFP, and that's why we need to resist it as we go into these negotiations.""

"Maureen McCleave was fitted with a new type of pacemaker Medical devices that are unsafe and have not been adequately tested are ending up inside patients' bodies, an investigation has revealed. The devices include heart pacemakers, rods to correct spines, and artificial knees and hips. The investigation found implants that had failed in baboons, or were tested only on pigs and dead bodies, were coming onto the market. The industry says it has transformed millions of lives for the better. BBC Panorama has been working with theInternational Consortium of Investigative Journalists,externaland 58 media organisations around the world includingThe Guardian,externalnewspaper and theBritish Medical Journal,external. The therapy tested on pigs and corpses The investigation found a lax system of regulation in Europe that allows companies to ""shop around"" dozens of safety organisations until one of them approves their product. It also found that doctors can be left in the dark about the true risk of treatments they are recommending to their patients. Maureen McCleave, 82 from Essex, was the first person in the UK to be fitted with the ""Nanostim"" pacemaker because of an irregular heartbeat. Pacemakers are life-saving implants that deliver electrical pulses to the heart to keep them beating regularly. Traditional ones have leads from a battery to the heart that deliver the electrical pulse, but the cables can break. The Nanostim was the first leadless pacemaker that sat inside the heart. Maureen said she was ""over the moon"" to be the first and felt like a ""good guinea pig"" when she was implanted with the device at Bart's hospital in London. ""I was so grateful that I'd been chosen, because it sounded too good to be true."" But three years after it was fitted, the battery in Maureen's Nanostim failed and surgeons could not get it out. She now has a traditional pacemaker keeping her alive. The Nanostim is still sitting inside her heart. She says: ""I don't like the thought I've got a piece of metal or whatever in my heart that's doing nothing and it's just laying there."" Maureen was not alone - a number of batteries failed and parts fell off inside patients. The pacemaker was withdrawn for safety reasons. At least two people died and ninety events were recorded in which patients were seriously harmed by the device. The Nanostim heart pacemaker was turned down by safety bodies in Germany because of a lack of evidence. Yet it was approved by the British Standards Institute in the UK. Not all medical devices are dangerous. Many save lives or dramatically improve quality of life. But the investigation has found that some devices are failing patients including: implants that cracked inside people's backs and had failed in baboon tests birth control implants that caused internal damage and bleeding misfiring implantable defibrillators mesh implants for incontinence that caused abdominal pain The BBC also uncovered a treatment for children with a severely curved spine, or scoliosis, which was allowed on to the market following tests only on pigs and dead bodies. Yet, due to a lack of transparency and data collection, the scale of any problem across the medical device industry remains a mystery to both patients and doctors. If you are worried, a panel of experts put together by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists has put together some advice. It recommends: ""Your first point of call should be the medical team that performed the operation. ""If you cannot go back to them for whatever reason, you should consult your primary care doctor. ""The doctor should be able to refer you to a specialist who is familiar with the device and the surgery you had."" International Consortium of Investigative Journalists: The Implant Files,external Patients in the UK can alsoreport problems to the regulator,external. Europe does not have a governmental body that checks medical devices before they are put onto the market. Instead a series of companies called notified bodies issue CE marks - the same mark of approval given to devices like toasters and kettles. There are 58 of them in Europe and approval by one means a product can be used anywhere in the European Economic Area (the EU plus Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway). But if one body says no, a company can shop around and ask another. Less than patients might think. And there is so much secrecy that even surgeons implanting these devices do not always see the evidence upon which a device has been approved for its safety and effectiveness. The British Standards Institution said it could not discuss the evidence for Nanostim due to ""confidentiality requirements"". Even the UK's regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, says it is ""bound by confidentiality when it comes to some of the actions that we've taken around individual devices"". But the investigation discovered there was only one clinical study before Nanostim was approved for use on the public. It followed just 33 patients for 90 days. Prof Rita Redberg Prof Rita Redberg, one of the world's leading cardiologists and from the University of California, San Francisco, said: ""We're talking about a permanently implanted pacemaker, so I think that's a very tiny study. ""They're supposed to last 10, 20 years. A 90-day follow up is not enough to learn much about the pacemaker."" MedTech Europe, the body the represents the medical devices industry, said: ""Millions of people have safely benefited from medical devices and can now live healthier, more productive and more independent lives. ""Life is unimaginable today without the hundreds of thousands of medical devices in our hospitals and in our homes."" And it defended the system of notified bodies which were ""selected for the expertise, impartiality, transparency and independence of their staff"". Abbott, which manufactured Nanostim, says that many patients have been helped by leadless pacemakers and many more will benefit from this technology in the future. It said: ""In accordance with the European CE Mark approval process, the Nanostim leadless pacing system was approved based on strong performance and safety data. ""In addition, upon CE Mark approval Nanostim was further assessed through a European post market clinical follow-up study."" The UK's Royal College of Surgeons has called for ""drastic regulatory changes"". Prof Derek Alderson, president of the Royal College of Surgeons, said: ""All implantable devices should be registered and tracked to monitor efficacy and patient safety in the long-term."" But when the European Union suggested tightening the rules, the industry ran a campaign called ""Don't lose the 3"". It referred to the fact that manufacturers can get new products to patients three years quicker in Europe then they can in the United States. New medical device regulation will come into forcein Europe in 2020,external, but campaigners say the new rules do not go far enough. German MEP Dagmar Roth Behrendt told Panorama that an intensive lobbying campaign by the industry undermined the proposed reforms. ""It's a success for them and a failure for the European parliament and for European patients, I have no doubt about it. ""It is like an open wound for me, that we could not do more for European patients and for the safety of European patients hurts.""

Ashopton and the neighbouring village of Derwent were both sacrificed in the 1940s to create Ladybower Reservoir in Derbyshire. Some descendants of the villagers of Ashopton now live in nearby Bamford. The collection has been bought by Bamford and District History Group for Â£310 and will be put on display. The album contains more than 160 postcards showing life in the late 19th century and early 20th century The postcards will join the history group's archive of photos and documents and will go on display at meetings at Bamford Village Institute Kathleen Hearnshaw, chair of the history group, was one of three phone bidders who battled to buy the collection. ""I have never done anything like this before and I am so pleased,"" she said. ""We were excited about the prospect of buying the postcards but also anxious about securing them. Lots of people rang us offering donations to help the group buy them."" The villages were flooded in the 1940s to make way for Ladybower Reservoir One of the postcards shows construction of a dam They were collected over three decades by the seller, who wishes to remain anonymous. ""Ashopton postcards were like gold dust because they were so rare,"" she said. ""I dealt in postcards myself in the early 1980s and liked to collect them because I was fascinated by the story of the village."" One of the postcards shows the spire of Derwent's church emerging from the water There was said to be ""strong opposition"" to the flooding of the villages Historical buildings, limestone cottages and entire communities were lost when the valley was flooded to serve the growing cities of Derby, Sheffield, Nottingham and Leicester with water. Charles Hanson, from auctioneers Hansons, said there was ""strong opposition"" to the move but the authorities insisted on going ahead.

"The abandoned village has attracted huge numbers of sightseers Graffiti has been scratched on buildings and stones pulled from walls at a rarely seen abandoned village. ""Unprecedented"" numbers of visitors have flocked to Ladybower Reservoir in Derbyshire since low water levels revealed the ruins of Derwent. But park rangers say they have had to stop people trying to remove material from the site. The Peak District National Park authority said it was shocked by the damage to the ""iconic"" structures. Derwent was flooded in the 1940s to make way for Ladybower Reservoir, which was built between 1935 and 1943. But this year's long dry spring and summer hasreduced the water levels so low that remains of the village have been exposed, which had drawn crowds of people in recent weeks. This video can not be played Ladybower Reservoir's low water reveals 'drowned' village One visitor, Clare Whittaker from Sheffield, was left ""upset and mad"" when she saw both children and parents taking ""beautiful"" stones from the walls and throwing them into the mud. ""My Sunday visit to Ladybower left me very upset,"" she said. ""We're very lucky to get to see some good history but people were deliberately destroying that history."" Dr Steve Rowe, team leader of the Edale Mountain Rescue Team, said he had also seen vandalism at the site. ""There's a fair amount of graffiti and defacement on the ruins. It's a huge part of our history and now 'Cheryl' and 'Steve' have scratched their names in the rock. ""We need to look after it, we have a responsibility like you would at any historical site."" Stones taken from buildings and thrown into the mud at Ladybower A pump house from Derwent village has been exposed by the low water levels Anna Badcock, the park authority's cultural heritage manager, said: ""Whilst we understand that people are fascinated by the appearance of these usually hidden ruins, the structures remain an iconic archaeological feature of the Peak District National Park. ""As we wouldn't expect people to vandalise any of the National Park's many heritage buildings or other archaeological features, the remains of the homes and other submerged buildings are no exception. ""We urge people to leave these features intact to open a valuable window on to history, not just today, but for future generations to enjoy."" People are also being urged to look at the ruins of Derwent from the banks of the reservoir, rather than walking on the mud, which can be dangerous. Derwent before it was flooded to make way for Ladybower Reservoir Edale Mountain Rescue said they had already saved one man who was stuck up to his chest for almost two hours. Dr Rowe said: ""It's exciting and interesting; come and have a look but appreciate the risk. 'The first time I had sex I contracted HIV' Prince Harry and Meghan to move to Windsor Castle 'A wig makes you feel unstoppable' ""Visitor numbers are unprecedented at the moment. There are some areas of unstable mud - as someone said to me it's like walking on the skin of a rice pudding. ""You can see most of the stuff from the bank - we advise you stay there,"" he added.

Trooper Ross Woodward was off duty when he helped treat people with gunshot wounds and guided others to safety. He said receiving the honour came as a ""total surprise"". The 24-year-old from Beeston, Nottinghamshire had been enjoying a trip to the city with other soldiers after a desert training exercise in Nevada. The group had been in the Tropicana hotel opposite and abandoned their meal when they heard gunfire. ""Anyone in the military would have done the same,"" Trooper Woodward said. ""To me it just felt like the right thing to do, because people were there and needed my help. I just did not want to walk away and leave them. ""If I ever need help, I hope and pray that someone would help me."" The massacre was the biggest shooting in modern US history The father-of-one from 1st The Queen's Dragoon Guards described ""a lot of chaos"" and hearing people ""screaming, shouting, looking for loved ones"". One of the people he helped was a man in his 30s who had been shot in the back and struggling to breathe. ""I tried to reassure him that I wasn't going to leave him,"" he said. Troopers Stuart Finlay and Ross Woodward (right) abandoned a birthday meal to help victims ""I stayed by him, and a few moments passed and there was no response from him - I found out that he had passed away."" Six soldiers from the same regiment helped in the wake of the shooting and were praised by the Prime Minister for helping victims. Trooper Woodward received the Queen's Commendation for Bravery, which states he ""displayed conspicuous bravery, outstanding leadership and unwavering selflessness"". ""He consciously, deliberately and repeatedly advanced towards danger, moving people to safety and treating casualties,"" it adds.

"Jaydon James, 16, was described by local residents as a ""quiet"", ""lovely boy"" A 16-year old boy has died after being stabbed in Coventry. The victim, named by police as Jaydon Washington James, was found in Deedmore Road, Wood End, at about 23:40 GMT on Saturday. He died in hospital later. Police said Jaydon was attacked while with friends, who were also seriously injured and are in hospital. A murder investigation has been launched and West Midlands Police said officers were ""following a number of active lines of inquiry"". Jaydon's family said they were ""deeply saddened"" by what had happened and called for anyone with information to come forward. Deedmore Road was cordoned off near the Moat House and Castle Wood School Forensic officers have been checking drains as well as around bins and vehicles on Deedmore Road. Searches have also been carried out in the grounds of the nearby St Patrick's Catholic Church. Bunches of flowers have been left against a wall of the church in tribute to Jaydon, also known as JJ. Det Supt Matt Markham described the death as a ""terrible loss"" and said officers were ""working round the clock to find who was responsible"". Det Ch Insp Edward Foster, from the force's homicide unit, added: ""Jaydon had only just turned 16 with his whole life ahead of him. ""Words cannot describe the anguish that his family are going through, and we will leave no stone unturned in the hunt for his killer."" Forensics officers have been checking drains, bins and the grounds of a nearby school A family friend told the BBC the community had been ""completely shocked"" and described Jaydon as a quiet boy who was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Another local resident, Rebecca Rushton-Nesbitt, said: ""He was just an ordinary young boy. He wouldn't do anything to hurt anybody."" The road by Moat House Leisure Centre was blocked off by police, with a cordon about 200 yards (180m) further down the road at the entrance to the Moat House and Castle Wood School.

"A cache of Facebook documents has been seized by MPs investigating the Cambridge Analytica data scandal. Rarely used parliamentary powers were used to demand that the boss of a US software firm hand over the details. The Observer,which first reported the story,external, said the documents included data about Facebook's privacy controls. MP Damian Collins later told the BBC that he believed the documents were ""highly relevant"" to his inquiry. Facebook has demanded their return. The documents were intercepted when an executive of US tech firm Six4Three was on a trip to London. In a highly unusual move the House of Commons serjeant-at-arms was sent to the businessman's hotel and he was given a final warning and a two-hour deadline to comply with the order. When the executive failed to do so he was escorted to Parliament and warned he risked fines and imprisonment if the documents were not surrendered, the paper said. The firm is involved in court action against Facebook in the US, where the documents were obtained through legal procedures. Facebook v Soros: 'Congress must probe' Facebook appeals Cambridge Analytica fine Facebook treated voters with 'disrespect' Facebook told the Observer: ""The materials obtained by the DCMS committee are subject to a protective order of the San Mateo Superior Court restricting their disclosure. ""We have asked the DCMS committee to refrain from reviewing them and to return them to counsel or to Facebook."" But Damian Collins, chairman of the Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) Committee, said he believes the documents - which include emails - contain important information about how Facebook and other parties handle user data. He said he had written to Facebook stressing the House of Commons had powers to seize documents within UK jurisdiction. In his email to Facebook public policy vice president Richard Allen, which he posted on Twitter on Sunday evening, Mr Collins said a committee of the House can publish these documents under parliamentary privilege.

In an email to Mr Collins, also shared on Twitter, Mr Allen said that Six4Three's case against Facebook was ""entirely without merit"" and should not be taken at ""face value"". ""We hope you will want to reflect on the core issue behind the complaint... The case being brought by Six4Three is a challenge against our efforts to restrict access to data by apps in 2014/2015. ""On earlier occasions, your committee appeared to endorse this more restrictive approach. If this has now changed, it would be useful to understand why,"" he wrote. Mr Allan is due to appear before a DCMS committee hearing on Tuesday where details from the documents could be made public. Facebook and its founder Mark Zuckerberg have faced intense pressure over the social media giant's use of personal data, the spread of fake news, and, this month, allegations that it hired a PR firm to make claims about the financier George Soros. Last month the UK data watchdog fined Facebook Â£500,000 following its investigation into the Cambridge Analytica affair. Facebook has appealed against the fine, claiming that the watchdog found no evidence that UK users' personal data had been shared inappropriately and the penalty was therefore unjustified. The Cambridge Analytica scandal stems from the discovery that an academic at the University of Cambridge - Dr Aleksandr Kogan - used a personality quiz to harvest up to 87 million Facebook users' details. Some of this was subsequently shared with the political consultancy Cambridge Analytica, which used it to target political advertising in the US. It was initially reportedthat about 1.1 million UK-based users had had their details exposed.

"The problem was worst among babies born in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde area Nearly 600 babies have been born ""addicted"" to drugs in Scotland since 2015, health boards have revealed. The problem was worst in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde area, with 178 cases over the three years. The Liberal Democrats, who obtained the figures using Freedom of Information, said they showed why Scotland needed a ""more progressive"" drug abuse policy. The Scottish government said it was ""committed to giving every child the best start in life"". Data from health boards showed 584 infants - the equivalent of almost four a week - were delivered suffering from neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) over the three-year period. Lib Dem health spokesman Alex Cole-Hamilton said: ""On average, a baby is born every other day in Scotland addicted to harmful substances. ""These are terrible circumstances under which to take your first breath."" Babies born with NAS, which is caused by drugs passing from the mother to her unborn child during pregnancy, can suffer from a range of symptoms, including uncontrollable trembling, hyperactivity, and high-pitched crying. The number of infants recorded as being affected by this fluctuated from 203 in 2015-16, to 190 in 2016-17 and 191 in 2017-18. There were 120 such births in the Grampian region over this period and 63 in NHS Lothian between 2015 and 2017 - the board having only provided data for that period. NHS Tayside gave figures for births in the calendar years 2015, 2016 and 2017, with the number of infants born addicted totalling 61 over this period. Mr Cole-Hamilton said the problem could be avoided ""with the right combination of policies and support to help those misusing drugs"". He added: ""If the Scottish government is committed to giving every Scottish child the best start in life, it needs to take a progressive approach to drug policy and tackle the horrendous levels of drug misuse, life-long addictions and unnecessary deaths. ""Alcohol and drug partnerships were set back massively by the Scottish government's brutal Â£20m funding cuts. It was rightly overturned two years later but the sector is still in recovery. It can't happen again. ""We also need a new national strategy that is finally focused on treating drug misuse as a health issue, supporting people instead of criminalising and penalising them."" The Scottish government said its new combined drug and alcohol strategy would focus on ""how services can adapt to meet the needs of those most in need"". A spokesman said: ""We have recently released further funding to reduce the harms caused by alcohol and drugs, bringing the total provided to more than Â£70m this financial year. ""This is in addition to the Â£746m we have invested to tackle alcohol and drug use since 2008.""

"Nicola Sturgeon has warned of broken promises over fishing as EU leaders agreed to Theresa May's Brexit deal. A document published by the remaining 27 EU countries made clear they hoped to negotiate access to UK waters based on existing rights. Ms Sturgeon said that could not be squared with promises made to the UK fishing industry. Theresa May has said her deal would take the UK out of the controversial Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). Reality Check: What is the SNP's Brexit policy? Theresa May's letter to the nation Brexit: A really simple guide What happens if MPs reject Brexit deal? The prime minister and EU27 leaders approved the Brexit deal on Sunday after less than an hour's discussion at a meeting in Brussels. But a document published online made clear the remaining EU members were still seeking to negotiate continued access to UK fishing grounds during the two-year transition period. Thedocument,externalsaid a fishing deal was a priority and ""should build on, inter alia, existing reciprocal access and quota shares"". Scottish Secretary David Mundell has previously said he could not support any extension of CFP rules beyond 2020. Ms Sturgeon tweeted: ""I'll be interested to hear David Mundell explain how this - 'existing reciprocal access and quota shares' - can be squared with the promises made to the Scottish fishing industry. (Hint - it can't)."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Brexit deal has implications for the debate over Scottish independence and the future of fishing. The withdrawal agreement does not let Scottish Conservatives off the hook over the fishing industry. All 13 Scottish Tory MPs demanded exit from the common fisheries policy by 2020 and insisted ""access and quota shares cannot be included"" in the future economic partnership. Both the UK and EU say they'll use ""best endeavours"" to conclude a new fisheries agreement by 2020 but the EU has certainly not given up on keeping its current share of the UK catch. A statement agreed by the EU27 makes clear they will prioritise an agreement that builds on ""existing reciprocal access and quota shares"". In short, the fight over fishing is deferred. Read Glenn's analysis in full Mr Mundell later responded, saying any future deal on fishing had still to be agreed, and that the prime minister had made clear she would defend the UK's fishing interests robustly. He tweeted: ""The Prime Minister made clear earlier today, the UK will be an independent coastal state once again, in full sovereign control of our waters, able to decide for ourselves who we allow to fish in them, with that access not tied to any other aspect of our economic partnership."" Nicola Sturgeon has also criticised Theresa May's appeal to the public to get behind the Brexit deal. In a letter to the nation Mrs May has said leaving the EU next year would be ""a moment of renewal and reconciliation for our whole country"". The800-word messagesaid the UK would ""take back control"" of laws and money which, it suggested, could be spent on the NHS."" But Ms Sturgeon said that ""almost nothing in this desperate letter is true"". She said the UK Parliament should consider ""better alternatives"", such as remaining in the single market and customs union permanently - and she urged MPs to reject it. What is the SNP's position on Brexit? In Brussels, French president Emmanuel Macron stressed the importance his country placed on fishing in future talks. He said ""all of our fishermen will be protected"", with the French planning to ""defend access as part of the indispensable balance"". The Aberdeen South MP Ross Thomson, the only Scottish Tory who has so far said he will vote against the Brexit deal in the House of Commons, said the EU27 document was ""troubling"". He told the BBC's Sunday Politics Scotland: ""The arrangement that we have on fisheries has been devastating to fishing communities across Scotland and across the whole of the UK. ""It's in the interest of the EU to keep it going and they want to build on those existing arrangements, so to my mind that can only mean the continuation of some form of common fisheries policy. ""It may not be called that but if it looks like the CFP and behaves like the CFP, it is the CFP."" Mrs May, in her letter to the nation, insisted that the UK would become an independent coastal state with ""full control over our waters"". She wrote: ""We will be out of EU programmes that do not work in our interests: out of the Common Agricultural Policy that has failed our farmers, and out of the Common Fisheries Policy that has failed our coastal communities."" Labour, however, has written to Scottish Secretary David Mundell asking him to clarify his position in light of the EU document. Shadow Scottish Secretary  Lesley Laird wrote: ""I do not need to tell you that this is a clear breach of your red line on fishing. ""I would therefore be grateful if you were able to clarify that you will not be voting for the deal on this basis.

"Lewis Hamilton won the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix to end the season in which he clinched his fifth World Championship on a high. It was the 11th victory of the year for Hamilton, who dominated the race with a controlled drive. Hamilton performed 'doughnut' spins after crossing the line, before he and former title rival Sebastian Vettel flanked the retiring two-time world champion Fernando Alonso, and all three performed more doughnuts on the start-finish straight. Hamilton and Vettel then each shared an embrace with Alonso, demonstrating their respect for each other's abilities. The three drivers hold 11 of some of the most recent World Championships won in a golden era for driving talent in the sport. Vettel took second after Hamilton's team-mate Valtteri Bottas faded to fifth, which means the Finn ends the season without a victory. Red Bull's Max Verstappen and Daniel Ricciardo took third and fourth. Abu Dhabi Grand Prix results Hamilton wins in Abu Dhabi - reaction Hamilton ends season in style - Abu Dhabi post-race podcast A sweet moment: Hamilton, Vettel and Alonso indulge in a triple doughnut Hamilton goes topless on the podium, and we thought Raikkonen refusing to remove his sunglasses was controversial... Renault's Nico Hulkenberg emerged unhurt from a frightening-looking accident in which he was pitched into a roll and landed upside down in a first-lap clash with Romain Grosjean's Haas. Hulkenberg sounded scared as he said to the team: ""I'm hanging here like a cow. Get me out. There's fire."" But once the fire was extinguished and the car righted, he was able to climb out unaided. Hulkenberg appeared trapped in his car as it caught fire Hamilton's evening under the lights of the attractive but characterless Yas Marina circuit was complicated when Mercedes pitted him earlier than expected during a caution period caused when Kimi Raikkonen's Ferrari stopped on the pit straight. That was on lap seven of 55 - nine laps earlier than Bottas' first stop - but Mercedes were covering one of their rivals potentially doing the same thing. It meant a race of careful driving and tyre management, but Hamilton handled it well, to re-claim the positions he had lost one by one as his rivals pitted. This video can not be played Was Fernando Alonso a pantomime villain? Behind him, the race came to a tense climax as the differing strategies of Vettel and the two Red Bull drivers converged. Max Verstappen was closing on Vettel as the second Red Bull of Daniel Ricciardo closed on the Dutchman. But both Red Bull drivers lost time when they came upon the lapped car of Pierre Gasly as it was suffering an imminent engine failure with smoke pouring out of it. That gave Vettel breathing space and locked the Red Bulls in their positions. It was a disappointing end to a bold attempt by Ricciardo and Red Bull to benefit from a different strategy by running very long to their first pit stops, but in the end it made little difference. Will Smith was guest of honour of Lewis Hamilton as part of his 50th birthday bucket list - and filmed it all for social media Fernando Alonso's illustrious career ended with an 11th place, just out of the points. The McLaren, which started 15th, was just not quick enough for him to do any more. There was time for one more bit of radio magic, though, when his engineer in the closing laps said: ""Go and get a point."" Alonso, 37, replied: ""I've already got 1,800."" Actually, he has 1,899 so it would have made a round 1,900, but he could not catch Kevin Magnussen's Haas - not helped by a five-second time penalty for cutting a chicane when he missed his braking point pushing while chasing the Dane. Max Verstappen did a great job in keeping his hyper-soft tyres alive for a longer first stint than either Mercedes on the ultra-softs, pressured Bottas and took a third place that lifted him to fourth in the championship. Lots of hard work designing and building new cars, pre-season testing and then a new season starts in Melbourne, Australia in March next year. It'll be there before you know it.

"Saturday's accident occurred off Uganda's Mukono district, near Kampala At least 29 people are now known to have died after a cruise boat carrying party revellers capsized on Lake Victoria, Ugandan police say. The vessel was carrying close to 100 people when it sank on Saturday near Uganda's capital, Kampala. Ugandan media named a number of well-known people said to be on the boat, adding that the prince of a traditional kingdom had survived. Lake Victoria sees regular accidents, often involving overcrowded vessels. Scores of people died when a ferry sank on the lakeoff Tanzania in September. Saturday's accident occurred off Uganda's Mukono district. Deputy police spokesman Patrick Onyango told Reuters news agency: ""The boat was overloaded and secondly there was bad weather."" More than 20 people have been rescued from the water, police say, but an unknown number remain missing. The BBC's Catherine Byaruhanga, at the scene The families and friends of some of the people involved gathered by the shoreline. They sat under trees, looking through the wire fence and every time a body was pulled out of the water, there were screams and cries as some people recognised their loved ones. On the grass some personal items were laid out - shoes, sweaters, wallets, keys - anything that could be used to identify the victims. Overhead the police deployed a helicopter to help search for more bodies that might have washed up by the shoreline - but they have given up hope that they will find any more survivors. Among those rescued was Prince Daudi Kintu Wasajja, a brother of the king of Uganda's largest traditional kingdom, Buganda. Ugandan media said musical artist Iryn Namubiru also survived. A number of other popular artists and socialites were believed to be on board. The boat was reportedly hired out for weekend parties. Many of those on board had no lifejackets. Local officials said two small fishing boats that came to the rescue also became overloaded and sank. With a surface area greater than Switzerland, Lake Victoria is the world's second-biggest lake and the largest in Africa Shared by Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania, some 30 million people depend on its resources Challenges include pollution and falling water levels - biodiversity in Lake Victoria has dropped by 50% since the 1980s English colonialist John Hanning Speke named it after Britain's Queen Victoria when he travelled there in 1858 Some have called for the lake's name to be changed - proposals include its Luganda-language name Nalubaale, and Lake Jumuiya which means ""togetherness"" in Swahili Scientists warn Lake Victoria is dying.

"Thousands of migrants are now waiting at the border in Mexico Mexico's incoming foreign minister has said discussions on how to deal with migrants travelling to the United States are continuing despite reports a deal has been reached. Marcelo Ebrard denied reaching an agreement which would see asylum seekers waiting in Mexico while their claims were processed in US courts. Mr Ebrard's words seem to contradict US President Donald Trump's latest tweet. He said migrants would not be allowed entry until their claims were approved. ""Migrants at the Southern Border will not be allowed into the United States untiltheir claims are individually approved in court,"" Mr Trump wrote,external, adding: ""No 'releasing' into the US. All will stay in Mexico."" Humanitarian crisis develops in Tijuana What is the migrant caravan heading to US? The conflicting statements emerged after the Washington Post reported Mexican officials had agreed to let migrants trying to enter the US stay in Mexico while their asylum claims were heard. According to the newspaper, the plan was called ""Remain in Mexico"". But Mr Ebrard, who will become foreign minister in December after Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's administration takes power, said the US had yet to even send ""a specific proposal"" on how to deal with the issue. He said conversations were still taking place with Washington. There are fears migrants could be stuck in temporary shelters for months Incoming Interior Minister Olga Sanchez Cordero also told news agency Reuters no agreement had been reached - although the Washington Post article initially quoted her as saying it was a ""short term solution"" to deal with the migrant caravan. Thousands of migrants - including women and children - are currently at the US-Mexico border after travelling more than 4,000km (2,500 miles) from Central America. They say they are fleeing persecution, poverty and violence in their home countries of Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador. Many are now waiting in temporary shelters in the border city of Tijuana, leading the mayor declare a humanitarian crisis. There are fears as many as 9,000 may be stuck in the city for months. Meanwhile, Mr Trump has deployed about 5,800 troops to the border and has previously described the migrants as an ""invasion"". What is the migrant caravan heading to US?

"The talking in Brussels is done. After nearly two years of negotiations, arguments - and the inevitable moments where it felt like the process would explode - there is, now, a deal. It's a compromise. It was always going to be. It's not a happy compromise either. People on both sides of the Brexit argument are already screaming their protests. And although the prime minister must be relieved, she didn't exactly say that she was pleased about the deal when I asked her at a news conference this lunchtime. Instead, she said she was sure the country's best days are ahead. But however she really feels about it - and with this prime minister it is hard to tell - her strategy for the next couple of weeks is crystal clear. Her case? This is all there is. UK's Brexit deal agreed by EU leaders Brexit deal 'worse than no deal' - DUP Theresa May's 'letter to the nation' in full With the explicit backing of almost every European leader who has opened their mouth today, this is the ""only deal"", the ""best possible deal"", ""the max"". The message to MPs from Theresa May and her counterparts: don't kid yourselves if you think something else might magically appear if you vote it down. And the message to the public? Just let me get on with it, then we can all stop talking about Brexit - please. Again today she used the platform to ""talk directly to the British public"", to explain how her (now rather pink) red lines, on ""money, laws and borders"", have been followed. It's her Brexit with caveats, with a lot to be sorted out about the future, in the future.You can remind yourself what's actually in the deal here. And No 10 is all too aware that dozens and dozens of their own MPs hate it. Theresa May has reached her imperfect compromise at a moment when in Parliament both sides are hardening against the idea of compromising at all. What happens if MPs reject Brexit deal? Brexit: All you need to know 'Wales less prosperous after Brexit deal' For two years Theresa May has survived by tacking one way, then another. But now the deal is on paper, in black and white, that approach can't go on. A senior government figure said privately that No 10 was past the point of trying to please everyone. And of course, everyone in government is all too aware that it is likely that the deal will be rejected by Parliament in any case. But the only potential route through for the prime minister is through the middle, to look like, as one senior Whitehall official describes it, ""the adult in a world of children"". However the prime minister looks, however she sounds in the next fortnight, the levels of unhappiness at home are so profound that her pleas may fall on deaf ears. If the deal falls, she - and her government - may fall with it. Scrape it through then she'll have pulled off a feat far harder than getting the actual deal done. PS: Here's a great explanation from my colleague Ben Wright about what might happen if the vote, which we expect on 12 December, doesn't pass the deal.

"Thedraft political declaration,externalon the future relationship between the EU and the UK, after Brexit, is out. Theresa May describes it as the right deal for the UK. A few points to rememberâ¦ This is not a legally binding document. It's not very long either, but it has grown from last week's seven-page outline to 26 pages. It sits alongside the 585-page Draft Withdrawal Agreement (which will be legally binding if it gets ratified). This is also a draft, agreed by negotiators, but it still needs to be approved by the leaders of all 28 EU countries at a summit scheduled to take place on Sunday. Don't expect major changes. Formal negotiations on everything it contains can only begin after Brexit has actually happened - currently after 29 March 2019. It contains plenty of aspirations involving shared interests, close partnerships and ambitious co-operation, but many of the details are still to come. Here's an initial look at what's in the text: A reminder that this really is about everything, not just about trade: the entire scope of the future relationship between the UK and its nearest neighbours. Both sides want that relationship to be as close and co-operative as possible but that aspiration will be tested in the years ahead. Again, it's worth emphasising that this is not a legally binding document, so there are no guarantees about what the post-Brexit world will look like. And no-one can say for certain how long it will all take to negotiate. The bottom line of both parties is included early on. Anything that is negotiated must be consistent with the EU's four freedoms - the free movement of goods, services, capital and people. And nothing will be agreed that threatens the sovereignty of the United Kingdom. As we've seen for months now, the issue of the Irish border is where the combination of these core principles becomes most complicated. So trade in goods should be ""as close as possible"", but that's not the same as being frictionless. It leaves a lot of wriggle room in negotiations, with no guarantee of the final outcome. The two sides are committing themselves to an ""ambitious, wide-ranging and balanced"" economic partnership, based on a comprehensive free trade agreement. But there is also repeated emphasis that there must be a level playing field, which ensures open and fair competition. The more economic rights you retain, the EU is reminding the UK, the more obligations to which you have to sign up. When the outline of this draft emerged last week, this was a notion that raised alarm bells for many supporters of Brexit. Dominic Raab mentioned it in his resignation statement. Their fear, which will not be dispelled by this draft text, is that temporary customs arrangements could easily turn into some form of permanent customs union, preventing the UK from doing its own trade deals on goods around the world. The government denies this, and argues that there is nothing wrong in wanting ambitious customs arrangements in the future, including the need to avoid checks on what are known as ""rules of origin"". The declaration also mentions explicitly an ""independent trade policy"" for the UK in the future. We are, this emphasises, open to any solution that will avoid the proposed backstop solution, to keep the Irish border open. That includes technological and other solutions that critics of the Brexit negotiations say have been ignored for too long. The trouble is that technological solutions that avoid the need for any border infrastructure are not in operation anywhere in the world. UK officials see this as a key sentence, which suggests there is plenty of room for manoeuvre in the negotiations to come. It makes clear, they argue, that it is not the case that the UK can only have either a basic free trade agreement (like Canada) or membership of the single market (like Norway), with nothing in-between. But none of the language here commits the EU to anything specific. As expected, the regulation of financial services will be based on a system of ""equivalence"" and the aim is to negotiate the details in this key sector before the end of June 2020. There's nothing in the language here to suggest that the UK will get better terms than any other third country dealing with the EU - but that will be a key negotiating aim. There are also plenty of aspirational words on ""ambitious and comprehensive"" plans for the service sector in general, but there is an awful lot to negotiate. There are plenty of nods towards the way the world economy is changing, and the importance of comprehensive agreements on data. The UK hopes that in the negotiations to come, it can be well positioned to take advantage of new technologies and the digital economy. But the EU has already made it clear that the UK cannot expect to have the same access to all EU databases - in various economic and security areas - as it would have as an EU member state. This fulfils the prime minister's pledge that the UK will take back control of its borders and free movement of EU citizens to the UK will come to an end. But it means, of course, that free movement for UK citizens travelling to the EU will also stop. The document says both sides want to preserve visa-free travel for short-term visits (don't worry about your holidays) but it suggests by implication that visas could be introduced for longer stays. There is neutral language here, including the ""best endeavours"" principle that commits both sides to doing everything they can to reach a deal. But that disguises the fact that there are still deep disagreements on fishing, and on getting the right balance between access for UK produce to EU markets, and access for EU boats to UK fishing waters. Expect this one to run and run, because the UK is not alone in having a vocal fishing lobby with more political power than its overall contribution to the economy might suggest. There is a lot in this document on security - both on internal police co-operation and on broader foreign policy and defence co-operation. The EU needs the UK in many of these areas, but the draft makes clear that - on internal security matters in particular - there is a variety of legal and technical issues to overcome. We can expect, though, that UK and EU foreign policy will be co-ordinated as closely as possible in the future. Rather like the Draft Withdrawal Agreement, the political declaration envisages a system of dispute resolution involving a joint committee and an arbitration panel. But once again, on matters of EU law (and there will be a lot of that involved in any future relationship) the final word will rest with the European Court of Justice. The government will point out that after Brexit the direct jurisdiction of the ECJ in the UK will come to an end. There is a plethora of other issues in the draft document that this article hasn't covered: transport, energy, intellectual property and so on. Both sides say they hope all these issues and more can be wrapped up by the end of 2020. It's an ambitious timetable.

"We all do it - we don't quite understand something, so we reach for our phones and Google it. And Brexit is no different. Here we answer the five most-googled questions to do with Brexit over the past 24 hours. Don't worry, we promise to keep it simple. Brexit - short for ""British exit"" - is the process of the UK leaving the EU (European Union). The EU is a group of 28 countries which trade with each other and allow anyone to easily move between the countries to live and work. The UK had a referendum in June 2016 where it voted to leave the EU, which it's been part of for more than 40 years. But the exit didn't happen straight away - it's happening on 29 March 2019. Click here for more on Brexit This video can not be played Adam Fleming summarises the Brexit agreement in one minute(ish) After Brexit was voted for, negotiations started between the UK and the EU. The negotiations are over the ""divorce"" deal. This is a withdrawal agreement which sets out how exactly we leave the EU - not what will happen after we leave. On Wednesday, Prime Minister Theresa May presentedthat deal.Here are some key points: Payment: The UK will pay Â£39bn to the EU to cover what it owes Transition period: Between 29 March 2019 and 31 December 2020 nothing much changes to allow the UK and EU to strike a trade deal and to give businesses the time to adjust Immigration: EU citizens and their families can continue to move to the UK freely before 31 December 2020 Trade: There won't be any changes to trade in the transition period Northern Ireland: Neither the UK or the EU wants there to be a physical border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland (here's why). But in the deal, there's an agreement for a backstop. Click here for more on the draft withdrawal agreement This has been one of the biggest sticking points of the whole thing. Neither the UK or the EU want a visible or ""hard"" border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland with guard posts and checks. So they've agreed to put in place a ""backstop"" - that's just another word for a deal to make sure a hard border never happens. It would mean that Northern Ireland - but not the rest of the UK - would still follow some EU rules on things like food products and goods standards. The backstop would only be introduced if a trade deal between the EU and the UK isn't sorted out during the transitional period. But this bit is controversial. Some people say it means the UK would still be tied to EU rules while others don't like the idea of Northern Ireland having different regulations to the rest of the UK. Click here for more on the backstop On 25 November, the prime minister will try and get European leaders to officially back the deal. If approved, she then has to take it to MPs for a vote in Parliament. That's expected to happen in December. At the moment it looks like her deal would be defeated. She doesn't have enough Conservative MPs to force it through and there are MPs from all parties who aren't happy with what's being suggested. Click here for Brexit in eight charts Can May get Brexit deal through Commons? There was a big rally in October demanding a second referendum Well, it is written into UK law that Brexit is going to happen. But some people arecalling fora second referendum (they call it a ""People's Vote""), which would basically ask the question: ""Do you want the UK to leave the EU, now we know what the deal is?"" If that happened, then Brexit could potentially be reversed - but Theresa May has repeatedly said there won't be another referendum.

"A man has been charged with the attempted murder of a police officer after an alleged knife attack outside a train station in east London. Daniel Adeyemi, 24, is accused of trying to kill the officer at Ilford railway station on Friday night. Adeyemi, of Bedford Road, Ilford, has also been charged with possession of a bladed article and common assault against another police officer. He will appear before magistrates in London on Monday. The officer was taken to hospital but discharged the following day to continue his recovery at home, police said. The alleged attack comes amid an increase in concern over the safety of police officers in London and a rise in violent crime in the capital, particularly knife crime. The officer was taken to hospital and later discharged British Transport Police Federation chairman Nigel Goodband said.

"South Korea's president has revealed the first pictures of puppies mothered by one of North Korea's ""peace gift"" dogs, Gomi. The North's leader, Kim Jong-un, sent the two dogs to his counterpart Moon Jae-in in a bid to promote peace amid thawing ties on the Korean peninsula. Gomi, a Pungsan hunting dog, gave birth to three female and three male puppies. President Moon shared photos of the dogs on the official Blue House twitter feed on Sunday. ""As the pregnancy period of dogs is about two months, Gomi must have come to us pregnant,"" he reportedly tweeted when the pups were born. ""I hope inter-Korean affairs will be like this.""

"The Ukrainian navy accuses Russia of ramming and damaging one of its tugs Ukraine has accused Russia of ramming one of its boats off the coast of the annexed Crimea, amid rising tensions. The ""aggressive actions"" occurred as three Ukrainian ships sailed from the Black Sea port of Odessa to Mariupol in the Sea of Azov, Kiev said. Russia said the Ukrainian vessels were in its waters and blocked access to the Sea of Azov with a tanker. The Ukrainian navy later said the Russians opened fire on one of its ships and wounded a crew member. There has been no response from Russia on the allegation. Tensions have risen in the seas off the Crimean peninsula - annexed by Russia in 2014 - in recent months. Eastern Ukraine: A new, bloody chapter Ukraine names Russia as 'aggressor' state The Ukrainian navy said in a statement that its boats - two gunboats and the tug - were being monitored by two Russian helicopters scrambled by Moscow. Two Russian fighter jets were also seen flying low over the huge arch of the bridge, which Russia constructed earlier this year. A tanker under the bridge shut all navigation from and into the Sea of Azov The Ukrainian navy said the boats were waiting to cross into the Sea of Azov through the Kerch Strait, which Russia had shut off. A tanker was placed under the Russian-built bridge that spans the narrow Kerch Strait - the only access to the sea. Russia said the traffic was suspended for security reasons. Meanwhile, a Russian FSB security service official was quoted by Ria Novosti news agency as saying that Ukraine had sent naval reinforcements to the area. Russia earlier said the Ukrainian vessels - two small warships named as the Berdyansk and the Nikopol, and the tug - were trying ""to create a conflict situation in this region"" after they left Odessa. The ships ""illegally entered a temporarily closed area of Russian territorial waters"", the FSB reportedly said in a statement. But Ukraine said it had informed the Russians of its plan to move its ships through the sea to Mariupol. The navy statement said the Russian actions marked a breach of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. In recent weeks, a Ukrainian vessel was escorted by Russian tugs under the bridge in the Kerch Strait without an incident. The shallow Sea of Azov lies east of Crimea, and south of the Ukrainian regions partially seized by pro-Russian separatists. In 2003, Ukraine and Russia signed a treaty on the Sea of Azov, which defined it as internal waters of the two countries. The treaty guaranteed free navigation to all Ukrainian and Russian vessels. This video can not be played Jonah Fisher talks to a commander of the Ukrainian Navy about the tensions in the Azov Sea But Russia has recently increased its military presence and begun inspecting all vessels going to or from Ukrainian ports, with some calling Moscow's actions an ""economic blockade"". Earlier this month, the EU warned it would take ""targeted measures"" to address the issue. ""The situation in the Sea of Azov is damaging not only the Ukrainian economy, but also so many vessels that are flying the European Union member states' flags,"" EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said. The Russian inspections began soon after Ukraine detained a fishing vessel from Russian-annexed Crimea in March. Moscow also says the inspections of the vessels are necessary for security reasons, pointing to a potential threat to the bridge from Ukrainian radicals. The government in Kiev has repeatedly stated that the construction of the bridge was illegal. More than 10,000 people have been killed in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk region since separatists moved against the Ukrainian state in April 2014. Ukraine and the West accuse Russia of sending its troops to the region and arming the separatists. Moscow denies this, but admits that Russian ""volunteers"" are helping the rebels.

"A man has been charged with the attempted murder of a police officer after an alleged knife attack outside a train station in east London. Daniel Adeyemi, 24, is accused of trying to kill the officer at Ilford railway station on Friday night. Adeyemi, of Bedford Road, Ilford, has also been charged with possession of a bladed article and common assault against another police officer. He will appear before magistrates in London on Monday. The officer was taken to hospital but discharged the following day to continue his recovery at home, police said. The alleged attack comes amid an increase in concern over the safety of police officers in London and a rise in violent crime in the capital, particularly knife crime. The officer was taken to hospital and later discharged British Transport Police Federation chairman Nigel Goodband said.

"This video can not be played Tear gas and water cannon fired on fuel price protesters by Paris police French President Emmanuel Macron has lashed out at demonstrators who clashed with police in Paris during the latest protests sparked by rising fuel prices. ""Shame on those who attacked"" officers, he tweeted,external. ""There is no place for violence in the [French] Republic."" There was chaos on the Champs-ElysÃ©es on Saturday as police used tear gas and water cannon to disperse protesters. The demonstrations had been billed by the ""yellow vest"" movement as ""act two"" in a campaign that began a week ago. Named after their distinctive high-visibility attire, the protests initially focused on a rise in a fuel duty on diesel. They later grew to reflect anger at rising living costs, particularly in rural areas, and other grievances against President Macron's policies. Will Macron face down French fuel protesters? 'Gauls' resistant to change - Macron Jobseeker: Macron should help me find work More than 100,000 people took part in about 1,600 protests across France on Saturday, the interior ministry said. Most passed off peacefully - except in the capital, where 8,000 demonstrators gathered. On Tuesday, Mr Macron is due to address the nation and announce new measures as part of a speech on ecological transition. He is expected to mention the protests and call for nationwide ""grassroot debates"" on government policies. Five thousand police had been deployed in Paris. They had set up metal barriers around the Champs-ÃlysÃ©es to stop protesters reaching key buildings such as the president's office and the national assembly. A spokesperson for the demonstrators insisted that they were peaceful. ""We are not here to pick a fight with cops. We just want the government to listen to us,"" Laetitia Dewalle told AFP news agency. But in the morning, some tried to break through the police cordon. They lit fires, tore down street signs, erected barricades, pulled up paving stones and hurled them at police while shouting slogans against Mr Macron. The chaos continued into the evening, when police cleared most of the area. Protesters gathered on the Champs-ÃlysÃ©es many demanding Mr Macron's resignation Officials say 19 people were injured in the clashes, including four officers. Forty people were arrested. Demonstrations were staged around the country. Roadblocks were set up to slow down traffic. Some motorway toll booths were taken over to let vehicles through. There were a number of minor clashes. Overall 130 arrests were made. The protests and the violence were on a much smaller scale than the previous week. Last Saturday more than 280,000 people took part, two people were killed and more than 600 people injured. The barricades were still burning into the evening In his tweet, the president praised the security forces for ""their courage and their professionalism"". He added: ""Shame on those who attacked them. Shame on those who assaulted other citizens and journalists."" French state media reported that several reporters had been attacked in the southern cities of Toulouse and BÃ©ziers. Interior Minister Christophe Castaner accused the protesters of being influenced by the leader of the far-right National Rally party, Marine Le Pen. But she accused him, on Twitter, of dishonesty. The price of diesel, the most commonly used fuel in French cars, has risen by around 23% over the past 12 months to an average of â¬1.51 (Â£1.32; $1.71) per litre, its highest point since the early 2000s, AFP reports. World oil prices did rise before falling back again, but the Macron government raised its hydrocarbon tax this year by 7.6 cents per litre on diesel and 3.9 cents on petrol, as part of a campaign for cleaner cars and fuel. The decision to impose a further increase of 6.5 cents on diesel and 2.9 cents on petrol on 1 January 2019 was seen as the final straw. The president has blamed world oil prices for three-quarters of the price rise. He also said more tax on fossil fuels was needed to fund renewable energy investments. Analysis by Lucy Williamson, BBC News, Paris The spark for the protest is clear, but there's not much that unites the ""yellow vests"" beyond their high-visibility gear and their anger at rising taxes and living costs. In a country where protests are often tightly managed by one political party or trade union, this is a movement with no recognised national leader, no formal structure or affiliation, which unites voters of all ages, from the far-left, the far-right, even those who once supported President Macron. Their new co-operation is a sign that Mr Macron has failed to restore their faith in politicians, and that deep divisions remain. These are not France's most marginalised citizens, but those who say they struggle even while working, who feel they're bearing the brunt of France's economic problems, while businesses and the rich get tax breaks. The government has blamed ultra-right gangs for the violence in Paris, but there are many peaceful citizens - both at the barricades and at home - who support the movement too. Its diversity and democracy has been its strength so far, but also makes its ultimate vision unclear, and its membership hard to control. All drivers in France have to carry the jackets in their cars as part of safety equipment for use in a breakdown. Along with the familiar red reflective triangle which must be placed behind a broken-down vehicle on the side of a road, the high-visibility jacket - or ""gilet jaune"" - must be worn by the driver outside the car. Failure to wear the jacket after a breakdown or accident can result in a â¬135 (Â£120; $153) fine under a law introduced in 2008. Will Macron face down French fuel protesters?

"Nigel Dodds was addressing the Democratic Unionist Party conference Thewithdrawal agreement approved by the UK and EU leadersis ""worse than no deal"", DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds has said. The DUP, which props up the government, has repeatedly said it will vote against it in Parliament. There has been political opposition to the plan because of the backstop, which aims to avoid a hard Irish border. But Sinn FÃ©in, which campaigned against Brexit, has described the deal as ""the least worst option"" on the table. A number of business and farming groups in NIhave also urged the DUP to support the dealand provide certainty. EU leaders agree Brexit deal Reality Check: Brexit withdrawal agreement - what it all means Live: Reaction as EU signs off Brexit deal Speaking to BBC 5 Live's Pienaar's Politics, Mr Dodds said his party's ""one red line"" had been ignored by the government. The agreement on the backstop would see only Northern Ireland stay aligned to some EU rules, if it took effect. The DUP is concerned that the backstop could threaten the integrity of the union and place a trade border down the Irish Sea. ""What Theresa may has succeeded in doing is putting a proposition on the table which is worse than no deal and worse than staying in the EU, whatever else is put on the table,"" said the North Belfast MP. ""The government is going to spend the next fortnight engaged in all sorts of project fear initiatives in order to try to get MPs to vote for something that is clearly unsatisfactory."" This video can not be played Speaking to Andrew Marr, Arlene Foster called on Theresa May to look for a ""better deal"". The DUP has repeatedly said it will vote against the deal, as it stands, when it comes to Parliament to be ratified in a few weeks' time. Mr Dodds said his party would not be ""bought off"", he said, adding that ""there is absolutely no way this deal can go through on the basis of side offers."" ""The DUP has been very clear all along - we have core beliefs and principles and we're sticking by those,"" he said. Mary Lou McDonald said the deal agreed by the UK and EU would not resolve her party's concerns about Brexit Sinn FÃ©in President Mary Lou McDonald backed the withdrawal deal, but said: ""The agreement endorsed today between the EU27 and the British government does not resolve Brexit. ""It is the least worst option - there is no good Brexit."" ""It must be clear that under no scenario will there be a hardening of the border in Ireland or the abandonment of the Good Friday Agreement, which we must all work to fully implement and defend,"" she added. Earlier, DUP leader Arlene Foster said her party is ""disappointed"" with Theresa May and the government's decision to press ahead with the Brexit deal. Mrs Foster said the the agreement ""goes against everything"" the DUP had been promised. Speaking onThe Andrew Marr Showon Sunday, Arlene Foster said: ""We're disappointed with the way this has progressed. ""She (Theresa May) is a unionist, but this deal goes against everything she has said about all of that."" Mrs Foster said there is still time to negotiate for a ""better deal"". The importance of being unionist? Business 'on brink of chaos' if no deal ""We should use the time now to look for a third way. I recognise we are negotiating with a fatigue, there comes a time when everybody is tired and just wants to get on with it but we shouldn't accept the outcome for the sake of it,"" she added. Several newspapers have reported that the DUP is involved in discussions with several cabinet ministers about a secret ""Brexit plan B"", if Mrs May's deal does not get passed in the Commons. Mrs Foster did not explicitly deny the report, but said her party was having ""conversations right across government"" about the deal. The Irish border was the trickiest issue in the Brexit withdrawal negotiations She also said she did not see any circumstances right now where Mrs May's deal would have enough support to get through parliament. The DUP holds the balance of power at Westminster, as the government relies on the votes of its 10 MPs to have a working majority in parliament. It signed a confidence and supply pact with the Conservatives in June 2017 and negotiated an extra Â£1bn in spending for Northern Ireland - but the rift between the parties over the Brexit plan has put the arrangement under significant pressure. Mrs Foster has already said if the government's deal gets passed in the Commons,the DUP will have to review the confidence and supply pact. ""We'll review it at that point in time: things are fluid, things change - we'll have to see where we are,"" she added. The government has insisted that it will not renegotiate the current plan, and has urged MPs to back it or risk a no deal scenario.

"French troops helped the Malian army to push back jihadists from northern Mali in 2013 One of Mali's top jihadist leaders has been killed in a raid by French forces, the Malian army says. It says Amadou Koufa died in Friday's operation in the central Mopti region. France earlier suggested that Koufa might be among about 30 Islamists ""put out of action"" in the raid. The radical preacher is described as a senior member of the Jamaat Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM) group that has carried out frequent attacks in Mali and neighbouring Burkina Faso. The women keeping peace... in the deadliest place Mali country profile ""I confirm that Amadou Koufa was killed during the operation,"" Malian army spokesman Col Diarran Kone told Reuters news agency on Saturday. He declined to provide any further details. The French army had earlier said that its operation targeted a base controlled by Koufa. JNIM has so far made no public comments on the latest reports. Large swathes of northern Mali were seized by jihadists in 2012 until they were pushed back in a French-led military operation the following year. But parts of the country are still out of the government's control. France, the former colonial power, has thousands of troops in the volatile region to stem the insurgency.

"Prime Minister Theresa May has written a letter to the nation setting out why she thinks the public should back her Brexit deal. Here is the full letter. ""When I became your prime minister, the United Kingdom had just voted to leave the European Union. ""From my first day in the job, I knew I had a clear mission before me - a duty to fulfil on your behalf: to honour the result of the referendum and secure a brighter future for our country by negotiating a good Brexit deal with the EU. ""Throughout the long and complex negotiations that have taken place over the last year and a half, I have never lost sight of that duty. ""Today, I am in Brussels with the firm intention of agreeing a Brexit deal with the leaders of the other 27 EU nations. ""It will be a deal that is in our national interest - one that works for our whole country and all of our people, whether you voted 'Leave' or 'Remain'. ""It will honour the result of the referendum. ""We will take back control of our borders, by putting an end to the free movement of people once and for all. ""Instead of an immigration system based on where a person comes from, we will build one based on the skills and talents a person has to offer. Brexit: A really simple guide The five Brexit questions everyone's asking Google Can May get Brexit deal through Commons? ""We will take back control of our money, by putting an end to vast annual payments to the EU. ""Instead, we will be able to spend British taxpayers' money on our own priorities, like the extra Â£394 million per week that we are investing in our long-term plan for the NHS. ""And we will take back control of our laws, by ending the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the UK. ""In future, our laws will be made, interpreted and enforced by our own courts and legislatures. ""We will be out of EU programmes that do not work in our interests: out of the Common Agricultural Policy that has failed our farmers, and out of the Common Fisheries Policy that has failed our coastal communities. ""Instead, we will be able to design a system of agricultural support that works for us, and we will be an independent coastal state once again, with full control over our waters. The PM - here writing her conference speech in 2017 - has penned a letter to the British people about Brexit ""The deal also protects the things we value. ""EU citizens who have built their lives in the United Kingdom will have their rights protected, as will UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU. ""A free trade area will allow goods to flow easily across our borders, protecting the many skilled jobs right across the country that rely on integrated supply-chains. ""Because our European friends will always be our allies in the fight against terrorism and organised crime, the deal will ensure that security co-operation will continue, so we can keep our people safe. ""As prime minister of the United Kingdom, I have from day one been determined to deliver a Brexit deal that works for every part of our country - for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, for our Overseas Territories like Gibraltar, and also for the Crown Dependencies. ""This deal will do that. ""Crucially, it will protect the integrity of our United Kingdom and ensure that there will be no hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland - so people can live their lives as they do now. ""It is a deal for a brighter future, which enables us to seize the opportunities that lie ahead. ""Outside the EU, we will be able to sign new trade deals with other countries and open up new markets in the fastest-growing economies around the world. ""With Brexit settled, we will be able to focus our energies on the many other important issues facing us here at home: keeping our economy strong, and making sure every community shares in prosperity; securing our NHS for the future, giving every child a great start in life, and building the homes that families need; tackling the burning injustices that hold too many people back, and building a country for the future that truly works for everyone. The withdrawal agreement - what it all means What happens if MPs reject Brexit deal? ""On 29 March next year, the United Kingdom will leave the European Union. ""We will then begin a new chapter in our national life. I want that to be a moment of renewal and reconciliation for our whole country. ""It must mark the point when we put aside the labels of 'Leave' and 'Remain' for good and we come together again as one people.

"Prime Minister Theresa May has written a letter to the nation setting out why she thinks the public should back her Brexit deal. Here is the full letter. ""When I became your prime minister, the United Kingdom had just voted to leave the European Union. ""From my first day in the job, I knew I had a clear mission before me - a duty to fulfil on your behalf: to honour the result of the referendum and secure a brighter future for our country by negotiating a good Brexit deal with the EU. ""Throughout the long and complex negotiations that have taken place over the last year and a half, I have never lost sight of that duty. ""Today, I am in Brussels with the firm intention of agreeing a Brexit deal with the leaders of the other 27 EU nations. ""It will be a deal that is in our national interest - one that works for our whole country and all of our people, whether you voted 'Leave' or 'Remain'. ""It will honour the result of the referendum. ""We will take back control of our borders, by putting an end to the free movement of people once and for all. ""Instead of an immigration system based on where a person comes from, we will build one based on the skills and talents a person has to offer. Brexit: A really simple guide The five Brexit questions everyone's asking Google Can May get Brexit deal through Commons? ""We will take back control of our money, by putting an end to vast annual payments to the EU. ""Instead, we will be able to spend British taxpayers' money on our own priorities, like the extra Â£394 million per week that we are investing in our long-term plan for the NHS. ""And we will take back control of our laws, by ending the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the UK. ""In future, our laws will be made, interpreted and enforced by our own courts and legislatures. ""We will be out of EU programmes that do not work in our interests: out of the Common Agricultural Policy that has failed our farmers, and out of the Common Fisheries Policy that has failed our coastal communities. ""Instead, we will be able to design a system of agricultural support that works for us, and we will be an independent coastal state once again, with full control over our waters. The PM - here writing her conference speech in 2017 - has penned a letter to the British people about Brexit ""The deal also protects the things we value. ""EU citizens who have built their lives in the United Kingdom will have their rights protected, as will UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU. ""A free trade area will allow goods to flow easily across our borders, protecting the many skilled jobs right across the country that rely on integrated supply-chains. ""Because our European friends will always be our allies in the fight against terrorism and organised crime, the deal will ensure that security co-operation will continue, so we can keep our people safe. ""As prime minister of the United Kingdom, I have from day one been determined to deliver a Brexit deal that works for every part of our country - for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, for our Overseas Territories like Gibraltar, and also for the Crown Dependencies. ""This deal will do that. ""Crucially, it will protect the integrity of our United Kingdom and ensure that there will be no hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland - so people can live their lives as they do now. ""It is a deal for a brighter future, which enables us to seize the opportunities that lie ahead. ""Outside the EU, we will be able to sign new trade deals with other countries and open up new markets in the fastest-growing economies around the world. ""With Brexit settled, we will be able to focus our energies on the many other important issues facing us here at home: keeping our economy strong, and making sure every community shares in prosperity; securing our NHS for the future, giving every child a great start in life, and building the homes that families need; tackling the burning injustices that hold too many people back, and building a country for the future that truly works for everyone. The withdrawal agreement - what it all means What happens if MPs reject Brexit deal? ""On 29 March next year, the United Kingdom will leave the European Union. ""We will then begin a new chapter in our national life. I want that to be a moment of renewal and reconciliation for our whole country. ""It must mark the point when we put aside the labels of 'Leave' and 'Remain' for good and we come together again as one people. ""To do that, we need to get on with Brexit now by getting behind this deal. ""Parliament will have the chance to do that in a few weeks' time when it has a meaningful vote on the deal I hope to strike today. ""I will be campaigning with my heart and soul to win that vote and to deliver this Brexit deal, for the good of our United Kingdom and all of our people.""

There's more relief among businesses about today's agreement - and a warning to MPs. The head of the EEF manufacturing group, Stephen Phipson, said the uncertainty had hit firms ""particularly hard"", with investment delayed, jobs lost and growth hit. ""Todayâs agreement finally
provides a clear pathway to a stable and sensible transition from full membership
of the EU and avoids the horrific consequences of leaving without a deal,"" he said. Which is why, he added, MPs should take note as the vote in Parliament approaches. ""I
would strongly advise all MPs to look closely at this deal, the consequences of
the alternative and make a pragmatic decision that provides our economy
and business with the clarity and certainty we need,"" he said. Politicians in Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrat (CDU) party welcomed today's deal with the UK, while criticising Brexit itself.

""There could be no perfect solution for Brexit, which is a fundamentally wrong decision, in our opinion.""

Social Democrat (SPD) politician Christian Petry said the Brexit deal ""enables an orderly withdrawal"" for the UK.

She warned there was a risk of the UK undermining EU standards in those areas.

Shadow Scotland secretary Lesley Laird has written to David Mundell, calling on him to clarify his position on the withdrawal deal. The deal, she says, ""is a clear breach of your red line on fishing"", with some concerned there is insufficient clarity that the UK will not remain part of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) after Brexit. Secretary of State for Scotland David Mundell previously threatened to quit Theresa May's Cabinet if UK participation in the CFP continued beyond 2020. ""I would be therefore be grateful if you were able to clarify that you will not be voting for the deal on this basis,"" Ms Laird wrote. ""If that is the case, I really must ask why you have not resigned your position in the Cabinet?"" Dutch Finance Minister Wopke Hoekstra cautiously has welcomed the Brexit deal, but said ""Brexit itself is a disaster"". Speaking on the Dutch TV news programme Buitenhof, he said the UK exit was bad news for Europe, ""but in the end it will also turn out to be bad for the UK itself"". Brexit ""will have an impact on the Netherlands"", he said, as the UK is an important trade partner for the Dutch. You can listen tothe minister's comments here (in Dutch),external. The chance of Theresa Mayâs deal getting through parliament

"The European Union has endorsed the Brexit deal after 18 months of negotiations 'This is the best deal possible, this is the only deal possible,' says European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker Theresa May says it allows the country to 'move forward together into a brighter future' But the UK Parliament must also approve the deal - MPs are expected to vote in December A number of MPs from all sides have criticised the agreement Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt says the parliamentary arithmetic is 'challenging' Laurence Peter and Robbie Hawkins A European Union summit in Brusselshas backed the Brexit dealreached between the UK and EU. It took leaders just 40 minutes to endorse nearly 600 pages of legal text and a 20-page roadmap for the EU's future relationship with Britain. Calling it a sad day, the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker,  said that it was the ""best"" and ""only deal possible"". He warned that if British MPs thought they could get a better one next month by voting against the current offer, they would be disappointed. Prime Minister Theresa May said the deal ""delivered for the British people"" and set the UK ""on course for a prosperous future"", urging both Leave and Remain voters to get behind the agreement. Focus now returns to Westminster, with the deal expected to be put to MPs in the House of Commons before Christmas. Approval is far from guaranteed, with Labour, the Lib Dems, the SNP, the DUP and many Conservatives MPsall set to vote against it. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned ""nothing could be ruled out"" if Mrs May loses the vote - including the government collapsing. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said however the PM really feels about this deal, her strategy for the next couple of weeks is crystal clear. Her case? This is all there is.

Read the full BBC Reality Check piecehere. The EU leaders have approved the two key Brexit documents: There was no formal vote on Sunday, with the EU proceeding by consensus. There's more relief among businesses about today's agreement - and a warning to MPs. The head of the EEF manufacturing group, Stephen Phipson, said the uncertainty had hit firms ""particularly hard"", with investment delayed, jobs lost and growth hit. ""Todayâs agreement finally
provides a clear pathway to a stable and sensible transition from full membership
of the EU and avoids the horrific consequences of leaving without a deal,"" he said. Which is why, he added, MPs should take note as the vote in Parliament approaches. ""I
would strongly advise all MPs to look closely at this deal, the consequences of
the alternative and make a pragmatic decision that provides our economy
and business with the clarity and certainty we need,"" he said. Politicians in Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrat (CDU) party welcomed today's deal with the UK, while criticising Brexit itself. Quoted by Sueddeutsche Zeitung (in German),external, CDU parliamentary deputy leader Katja Leikert said it was ""the best possible result under very difficult circumstances"". ""There could be no perfect solution for Brexit, which is a fundamentally wrong decision, in our opinion."" A leading CDU MEP, David McAllister, called Brexit ""an historic mistake with heavy consequences for the UK"". Social Democrat (SPD) politician Christian Petry said the Brexit deal ""enables an orderly withdrawal"" for the UK. But the Greens' Europe spokeswoman Franziska Brantner called the deal ""far too weak"" on the environment and social welfare. She warned there was a risk of the UK undermining EU standards in those areas.  Toyota, which has a huge car plant near Derby, said it was now important for the UK and EU to press on and secure free and frictionless trade deal. The Japanese giant, which warned about the uncertainty around Brexit, said the agreement should ""avoid

appreciate that these have been challenging negotiations."" This video can not be played Brexit: 'I'm never changing my mind' says Juncker Adam FlemingBrussels reporter No member states raised objections
to the Brexit withdrawal deal and it was approved in a matter of seconds, a senior EU official told BBC Brussels reporter Adam Fleming. Around seven leaders spoke in the
session of the EU27, mostly to say that it was a sad day and
that they wanted the future relationship with the UK to be as close as possible. After Theresa Mayâs address,
roughly half of the leaders spoke. Several wished her good luck with the ""meaningful"" vote yet to come in Parliament. The senior official wouldnât
confirm or deny whether Mrs May had conceded privately that she
didnât have a majority for her deal in Parliament, but said no ""what ifs"" were discussed. The EUâs only Plan B was its
existing contingency planning, the official said. President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker insists that the deal reached between the UK and EU ""isthedeal"". ""I'm never changing my mind"", he told BBC Europe Editor Katya Adler. ""This is the best deal possible, this is the only deal possible."" As a result, if MPs were to reject the deal when it is put to the House of Commons, ""we would have no deal"". Brexit was not the result of a failure by the EU, he added, ""it's the responsibility of Britain"". ""You are telling people year after year, month after month, day after day, that the membership of the European Union is a bad thing for British citizens, so I don't think the European Union is guilty for the result.""

"Feeling a little lost on Brexit? Never really got your head around it in the first place? Let us walk you through it. Brexit is short for ""British exit"" - and is the word people use to talk about the United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union (EU). The EU is a political and economic union of 28 countries that trade with each other and allow citizens to move easily between the countries to live and work(click here if you want to see the full list).,external The UK joined the EU, then known as the EEC (European Economic Community), in 1973. A public vote - calleda referendum- was held on Thursday 23 June 2016 when voters were asked just one question - whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. TheLeave side won by nearly 52% to 48% - 17.4m votes to 16.1m- but the exit didn't happen straight away. It was due to take place on 29 March 2019 - but the departure date has been delayed (we will explain in more detail below). The 2016 vote was just the start. Since then, negotiations have been taking place between the UK and the other EU countries. The discussions have been mainly over the ""divorce"" deal, which sets out exactly how the UK leaves - not what will happen afterwards. This deal is known as theWithdrawal Agreement. The withdrawal agreement covers some of these key points: How much money the UK will have to pay the EU in order to break the partnership - that's about Â£39bn What will happen to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and, equally, what will happen to EU citizens living in the UK How to avoid the return of a physical border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland when it becomes the frontier between the UK and the EU This video can not be played Adam Fleming summarises the Brexit agreement in one minute(ish) It also includes atransition period,which has been agreed to allow the UK and EU to agree a trade deal and to give businesses the time to adjust. That means that if the withdrawal agreement gets the green light, there will be no huge changes between the date of Brexit and 31 December 2020. Click here for more on the draft withdrawal agreement Another, much shorter, document has also been drawn up that gives an overview of what the UK and EU's future relationship will be in the longer term. This is thepolitical declaration.However, neither side has to stick exactly to what it says - it is a set of ambitions for future talks. Click here for more on the political declaration The deal was agreed by the UK and the EU in November 2018, but it also has to be approved by British MPs. Well, no. They have voted against it three times. On 15 January they rejected the dealby 432 votes to 202- a record defeat. Then on 12 March, after Theresa May - the prime minister at the time - had gone back to the EU to secure further legal assurances,they rejected it again. And on 29 March - the original day that the UK was due to leave the EU -MPs rejected it for a third time(this vote was slightly different as it did not include the political declaration). Yes. As MPs did not approve Mrs May's withdrawal deal, she was forced to ask other EU leaders to delay Brexit. The deadline was delayed until 31 October- but, unable to see a way forward, Mrs May stepped down as PM and was replaced by Boris Johnson. There isa broad range of complaints, many of which claim the deal fails to give back to the UK control of its own affairs from the EU. One of the biggest sticking points has been over what happens at the Irish border. Both the EU and UK want to avoid the return of guard posts and checks (here's why), so something calledthe backstop- a sort of safety net - was included in the deal. The backstop is meant to be a last resort to keep an open border on the island of Ireland - whatever happens in the Brexit negotiations. It would mean that Northern Ireland, but not the rest of the UK, would still follow some EU rules on things such as food products. Theresa May insisted that, if all went as planned, it would never be used. Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop But it has annoyed some MPs, who are angry that the UK would not be able to end it without the EU's permission and so EU rules could remain in place for good. Other MPs would prefer the UK to stay closer to the EU - or even still in it. And others say Northern Ireland should not be treated separately from the rest of the UK. Boris Johnson has said he wants to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement with the EU - and remove the backstop. If he succeeds in doing this, it will still have to be approved by MPs before being passed into UK law. However, EU leaders have consistently said they will not renegotiate the withdrawal agreement and that the backstop is an essential part of any deal. If the prime minister fails to convince the EU to change the withdrawal agreement, he has promised to take the UK out of the EU without a deal on 31 October. Leaving the EU without a withdrawal agreement would be known as a ""no-deal Brexit"". New PM Boris Johnson has promised to take the UK out of the EU with or without a deal ""No deal"" means the UK will have failed to agree a withdrawal agreement. It would mean there would be no transition period after the UK leaves and EU laws would stop applying to the UK immediately(more on that here). The government says it is preparing for this potential situation. It expects some food prices could rise and customs checks at borders could cost businesses billions of pounds.(Read the government's report here),external. It has published a series of guides,external- which cover everything from mobile roaming on holiday to the impact on electricity supplies. Here is a list of10 ways you could be affectedby a no-deal Brexit. It is still written into law that the UK will be leaving, even though the deadline has shifted. The European Court of Justice has said the UK couldcancel Brexit altogether without the agreement of other nations- but few politicians publicly back this option.

"Now the Brexit deal has been signed off in Brussels, attention turns to Westminster. MPs will get their say on whether they approve of the deal or not. Several days of debate will be followed by what's known as the ""meaningful vote"". This is expected to take place in the week beginning 10 December. Any attempt to work out the parliamentary arithmetic can only be an estimate so all numbers should be treated with caution. As things stand, though, there seems to be a majority against the proposed deal. What happens if MPs reject Brexit deal? Who has written no confidence letters? A guide to where we are with Brexit Theresa May relies on the 10 Democratic Unionist Party MPs for her majority in the House of Commons. Their opposition to the proposed deal alone could make winning the vote tricky but the prime minister's problems don't end there. Some 57 Conservative MPs have signed up to the StandUp4Brexit campaign which argues that the proposed deal leaves the UK too close to the EU. (That includes Charlie Elphicke who is currently suspended from the party but generally votes with the government.) Added to those are the seven pro-Brexit MPs who resigned from government or party jobs on 15 November. And several more who have publicly stated they are opposed to the deal. Then there are, perhaps, a further dozen or so Conservative MPs from the Remain wing of the party who support the People's Vote campaign for another referendum or would like a closer relationship with the EU. All in all, there are around 80-90 Tories currently set to defy the government. Some of them have only said they can't support the deal which, perhaps, suggests, they might abstain when it comes to the crucial vote. But others are more hardline. On the other side of the calculation, there are a handful of pro-Brexit Labour MPs who might back the deal. And a further group who could vote for it to stop the possible alternative of a ""no deal"" Brexit. There's also one Liberal Democrat MP, Stephen Lloyd, who says he'll vote in favour of the deal to fulfil a pledge he made to his constituents. As things stand, though, this group isn't big enough to outweigh the DUP and Conservative rebels. Things can change of course. Mrs May will hope to persuade some of the rebels and more opposition MPs. But she has a long way to go.

"It feels like Westminster is tumbling towards a political crisis without modern precedent. On Tuesday 11 December, the House of Commons will conclude five days of debate with a vote on a government motion to approve the EU withdrawal agreement and accompanying political declaration. The terms of the UK's departure from the EU. But at the moment, it looks as if Theresa May faces an incredibly hard job getting it passed. She leads a government with a working majority of just 13. Only seven Tory rebels are needed to defeat it. EU won't offer 'better deal' on Brexit - May DUP may revisit Tory deal says Foster Brexit vote will be honoured, says Abbott But according to the latest number-crunching by BBC researchers, 81 Tory MPs have said they object to the deal Mrs May hopes to sign off with EU leaders on Sunday. With Labour, the Liberal Democrats, the SNP and even perhaps the DUP set to vote against the motion too, the withdrawal agreement looks set to be torpedoed in the Commons. Between now and then Theresa May will exhaustively insist the deal is in the national interest and the only way of ensuring Brexit happens. But if the withdrawal agreement is defeated, what happens then? The default position in that scenario would be for the UK to leave without a deal. Under both EU law and the UK's Withdrawal Act, Brexit day is chiselled into the diary for 11pm on 29 March, 2019. That's when the EU Treaties will stop applying to the UK. If Parliament rejects the deal, the same Withdrawal Act sets out what the government must do next. Ministers would have up to 21 days to make a statement to the Commons on ""how it proposes to proceed"". The government would then have a further seven days to move a motion in the Commons, allowing MPs to express their view on the government's course of action. This video can not be played Radio 4 The World at One asks: What will happen if Parliament rejects the Brexit plan? Crucially though, this would not be opportunity for MPs to throw a road-block in the way of a no-deal Brexit if that's what the government wanted to happen. Whatever motion the government brings back to Parliament will now have to be amendable, after MPs backed a change to it tabled by Conservative MP Dominic Grieve. MPs are hoping this will allow them to vote to rule-out a no-deal Brexit. The government would find it hard to ignore such a vote - but it would not carry the legal force to stop the UK leaving without a deal next March. Instead, the government would have to put new legislation before Parliament and secure the approval of MPs if it did not want the UK to leave without a deal. As the clerk of the House of Commons, Sir David Natzler, told a committee of MPs last month, ""there is no House procedure that can overcome statute. Statute is overturned by statute."" Can May get Brexit deal through Commons? Sir David Natzler (seated, front left) says MPs could vote again But in addition to the rigid legal position there would be the frenzied political reality. The maximum three-week window between the government's deal being defeated and the requirement on ministers to propose a way forward would see several alternative scenarios come into play. The prime minister could make a second attempt at getting the withdrawal deal through the Commons. Sir David Natzler said, in procedural terms, that would be possible. ""The words might be the same but the underlying reality would be self-evidently be different"", Sir David said. Brussels might be persuaded to tweak the political declaration on the future relationship to meet the concerns of MPs. Theresa May could try to return to Brussels to renegotiate the Northern Irish ""backstop"" - the main sticking point for many MPs. The government has long insisted this is not an option, because the EU has said the existing deal is final and there is no alternative. Might Brussels give Mrs May some leeway if she loses the vote by a narrowish margin? Some MPs hope she could get behind another version of Brexit at this point. There is support on the Tory benches for a membership of the European Free Trade Area, which would see the UK staying closely linked to the EU, like Norway. This would not be a straightforward move - and would require extensive renegotiation, even if the EU was prepared to contemplate it, and the extension of Article 50, delaying Brexit day. Then there is Labour's proposal for a permanent customs union - Mrs May has always ruled that out, but if enough MPs get behind it, it might be an option, although, again, it would need Article 50 to be extended to allow for more talks. Unlikely, given her track record of doggedly ploughing on against the odds - but if she is defeated by a heavy margin on 11 December she may feel she has no other option. There would then be a Tory leadership contest, which would turn into a fight to the death between the Leave and Remain wings of the party, with profound effects on the future of Brexit and, indeed, the country. Jacob Rees-Mogg's band of Brexiteers famously failed to reach the magic 48 letters of no confidence in the PM to trigger a leadership contest last month. But if she tries to cling on after a significant defeat on 11 December, more MPs could add their names to the list, forcing a no-confidence vote that she might struggle to win. MPs might suddenly shift in large numbers towards the idea of another referendum to break the Parliamentary impasse and open the possibility of stopping Brexit. At the moment, about eight Tory and 44 Labour MPs have publicly committed to another referendum. Theresa May is dead set against another referendum and it's hard to see an alternative Tory leader picking up that baton. But the Labour leadership has said all options should remain on the table (including another referendum) and the SNP and Lib Dems say there should be one too. However, a second referendum can only happen if the government brings forward legislation to hold one and a majority in the Commons supports it. There would have to be legislation. The rules for referendums are set out by thePolitical Parties, Elections & Referendums Act 2000,external. TheElectoral Commission's,externalrecommendation is that there should be six months between the legislation being passed and referendum day. This could be shortened but, realistically, not by all that much. The UCL Constitution Unit, a research centre on constitutional change, suggests that could be 22 weeks. So for the referendum to happen there would have to be a delay to Brexit - and that would require all 27 EU member states and the UK to agree. This is Labour's preferred outcome to the deal being rejected. But as Dr Jack Simson Caird from the Bingham Centre for the Rule of Law says, ""with the ticking clock of Article 50 it's very difficult to see that this represents a solution to the problem"" of a deadlocked parliament. That will be the other critical factor at play. Unless the government asks for an extension to the negotiating period - ie Brexit being delayed - the time for parliament and the government to agree a way forward is incredibly tight.  The clock won't wait. There are two routes to a general election through the Fixed Term Parliament Act. Two-thirds of MPs could vote for one. This is the quickest route - a poll could be held as soon as 25 working days later. Alternatively MPs could go for a no confidence motion in the government - Labour has said they will table such a motion if Mrs May loses on 11 December. This is a straight majority rather than requiring two thirds of MPs to vote for it. This gives two weeks for someone to demonstrate they can command a majority in the Commons. If that does not happen, the 25 working days countdown to a general election kicks in. Any election now would be on the existing constituency boundaries. The new ones have to be approved by the Commons and the Lords. And that has been put on hold until after Brexit. Another idea that has been floated is a ""negotiated no deal"" in the which the UK would ask the EU for a (paid) one year extension of membership before leaving on World Trade Organisation terms. Some Brexiteers might like the idea but it's hard to see Parliament supporting such a move - with or without an explicit vote. Because Parliament will have to come to a view. As Maddy Thimont Jack, from the Institute for Government think tank says: ""We do have Parliamentary sovereignty and there are clear ways for Parliament to express a very strong political view. ""I cannot see how a government can get through a legislative programme, for no deal, for example, if you don't have the support of Parliament."" Theresa May might have neutralised the chance of defeat in the Commons if she had found a Parliamentary consensus for the Brexit she planned to negotiate right at the start of the process. Instead, she faces a fraught few days and a vote that will define the country's future for many years. Right now, it looks like the government's deal cannot get through the Commons.

"Prime Minister Theresa May has written a letter to the nation setting out why she thinks the public should back her Brexit deal. Here is the full letter. ""When I became your prime minister, the United Kingdom had just voted to leave the European Union. ""From my first day in the job, I knew I had a clear mission before me - a duty to fulfil on your behalf: to honour the result of the referendum and secure a brighter future for our country by negotiating a good Brexit deal with the EU. ""Throughout the long and complex negotiations that have taken place over the last year and a half, I have never lost sight of that duty. ""Today, I am in Brussels with the firm intention of agreeing a Brexit deal with the leaders of the other 27 EU nations. ""It will be a deal that is in our national interest - one that works for our whole country and all of our people, whether you voted 'Leave' or 'Remain'. ""It will honour the result of the referendum. ""We will take back control of our borders, by putting an end to the free movement of people once and for all. ""Instead of an immigration system based on where a person comes from, we will build one based on the skills and talents a person has to offer. Brexit: A really simple guide The five Brexit questions everyone's asking Google Can May get Brexit deal through Commons? ""We will take back control of our money, by putting an end to vast annual payments to the EU. ""Instead, we will be able to spend British taxpayers' money on our own priorities, like the extra Â£394 million per week that we are investing in our long-term plan for the NHS. ""And we will take back control of our laws, by ending the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the UK. ""In future, our laws will be made, interpreted and enforced by our own courts and legislatures. ""We will be out of EU programmes that do not work in our interests: out of the Common Agricultural Policy that has failed our farmers, and out of the Common Fisheries Policy that has failed our coastal communities. ""Instead, we will be able to design a system of agricultural support that works for us, and we will be an independent coastal state once again, with full control over our waters. The PM - here writing her conference speech in 2017 - has penned a letter to the British people about Brexit ""The deal also protects the things we value. ""EU citizens who have built their lives in the United Kingdom will have their rights protected, as will UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU. ""A free trade area will allow goods to flow easily across our borders, protecting the many skilled jobs right across the country that rely on integrated supply-chains. ""Because our European friends will always be our allies in the fight against terrorism and organised crime, the deal will ensure that security co-operation will continue, so we can keep our people safe. ""As prime minister of the United Kingdom, I have from day one been determined to deliver a Brexit deal that works for every part of our country - for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, for our Overseas Territories like Gibraltar, and also for the Crown Dependencies. ""This deal will do that. ""Crucially, it will protect the integrity of our United Kingdom and ensure that there will be no hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland - so people can live their lives as they do now. ""It is a deal for a brighter future, which enables us to seize the opportunities that lie ahead. ""Outside the EU, we will be able to sign new trade deals with other countries and open up new markets in the fastest-growing economies around the world. ""With Brexit settled, we will be able to focus our energies on the many other important issues facing us here at home: keeping our economy strong, and making sure every community shares in prosperity; securing our NHS for the future, giving every child a great start in life, and building the homes that families need; tackling the burning injustices that hold too many people back, and building a country for the future that truly works for everyone. The withdrawal agreement - what it all means What happens if MPs reject Brexit deal? ""On 29 March next year, the United Kingdom will leave the European Union. ""We will then begin a new chapter in our national life. I want that to be a moment of renewal and reconciliation for our whole country. ""It must mark the point when we put aside the labels of 'Leave' and 'Remain' for good and we come together again as one people. ""To do that, we need to get on with Brexit now by getting behind this deal. ""Parliament will have the chance to do that in a few weeks' time when it has a meaningful vote on the deal I hope to strike today.

"The problem was worst among babies born in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde area Nearly 600 babies have been born ""addicted"" to drugs in Scotland since 2015, health boards have revealed. The problem was worst in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde area, with 178 cases over the three years. The Liberal Democrats, who obtained the figures using Freedom of Information, said they showed why Scotland needed a ""more progressive"" drug abuse policy. The Scottish government said it was ""committed to giving every child the best start in life"". Data from health boards showed 584 infants - the equivalent of almost four a week - were delivered suffering from neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) over the three-year period. Lib Dem health spokesman Alex Cole-Hamilton said: ""On average, a baby is born every other day in Scotland addicted to harmful substances. ""These are terrible circumstances under which to take your first breath."" Babies born with NAS, which is caused by drugs passing from the mother to her unborn child during pregnancy, can suffer from a range of symptoms, including uncontrollable trembling, hyperactivity, and high-pitched crying. The number of infants recorded as being affected by this fluctuated from 203 in 2015-16, to 190 in 2016-17 and 191 in 2017-18. There were 120 such births in the Grampian region over this period and 63 in NHS Lothian between 2015 and 2017 - the board having only provided data for that period. NHS Tayside gave figures for births in the calendar years 2015, 2016 and 2017, with the number of infants born addicted totalling 61 over this period. Mr Cole-Hamilton said the problem could be avoided ""with the right combination of policies and support to help those misusing drugs"". He added: ""If the Scottish government is committed to giving every Scottish child the best start in life, it needs to take a progressive approach to drug policy and tackle the horrendous levels of drug misuse, life-long addictions and unnecessary deaths. ""Alcohol and drug partnerships were set back massively by the Scottish government's brutal Â£20m funding cuts. It was rightly overturned two years later but the sector is still in recovery. It can't happen again. ""We also need a new national strategy that is finally focused on treating drug misuse as a health issue, supporting people instead of criminalising and penalising them."" The Scottish government said its new combined drug and alcohol strategy would focus on ""how services can adapt to meet the needs of those most in need"". A spokesman said: ""We have recently released further funding to reduce the harms caused by alcohol and drugs, bringing the total provided to more than Â£70m this financial year. ""This is in addition to the Â£746m we have invested to tackle alcohol and drug use since 2008.""

All 13 Scottish Conservative MPs - including Scottish Secretary David Mundell - threatened mutiny earlier this month unless the Brexit deal ensured the UK left the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). The CFP is the shared fisheries policy of the European Union, which sets quotas for the amount of fish countries are allowed to catch, as well as controlling what kind of fish are caught and where. The policy is deeply unpopular with fishing crews across the UK. Read more here about the impactof Brexit on the UK's fisheries. Scottish Conservative MP Ross Thomson has called the EU position on a future fisheries agreement with the UK ""deeply troubling"". Mr Thomson, who says he intends to vote against Theresa May's deal, says the EU have made clear in adocument published today,externalthat they want to maintain the unpopular Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). ""The current arrangement is very good for the EU, the arrangement we have on fisheries has been devastating for fishing communities across Scotland and the UK"", he says. ""It's in the interests of the EU to keep it going...It may not be called that, but if  it looks like the CFP and  behaves like the CFP then it is the CFP, and that's why we need to resist it as we go into these negotiations."" The prime minister has repeatedly stated that the deal will put the UK in ""full sovereign control of our waters"", with fishing not ""tied to any other aspect of our economic partnership"".

"The abandoned village has attracted huge numbers of sightseers Graffiti has been scratched on buildings and stones pulled from walls at a rarely seen abandoned village. ""Unprecedented"" numbers of visitors have flocked to Ladybower Reservoir in Derbyshire since low water levels revealed the ruins of Derwent. But park rangers say they have had to stop people trying to remove material from the site. The Peak District National Park authority said it was shocked by the damage to the ""iconic"" structures. Derwent was flooded in the 1940s to make way for Ladybower Reservoir, which was built between 1935 and 1943. But this year's long dry spring and summer hasreduced the water levels so low that remains of the village have been exposed, which had drawn crowds of people in recent weeks. This video can not be played Ladybower Reservoir's low water reveals 'drowned' village One visitor, Clare Whittaker from Sheffield, was left ""upset and mad"" when she saw both children and parents taking ""beautiful"" stones from the walls and throwing them into the mud. ""My Sunday visit to Ladybower left me very upset,"" she said. ""We're very lucky to get to see some good history but people were deliberately destroying that history."" Dr Steve Rowe, team leader of the Edale Mountain Rescue Team, said he had also seen vandalism at the site. ""There's a fair amount of graffiti and defacement on the ruins. It's a huge part of our history and now 'Cheryl' and 'Steve' have scratched their names in the rock. ""We need to look after it, we have a responsibility like you would at any historical site."" Stones taken from buildings and thrown into the mud at Ladybower A pump house from Derwent village has been exposed by the low water levels Anna Badcock, the park authority's cultural heritage manager, said: ""Whilst we understand that people are fascinated by the appearance of these usually hidden ruins, the structures remain an iconic archaeological feature of the Peak District National Park. ""As we wouldn't expect people to vandalise any of the National Park's many heritage buildings or other archaeological features, the remains of the homes and other submerged buildings are no exception. ""We urge people to leave these features intact to open a valuable window on to history, not just today, but for future generations to enjoy."" People are also being urged to look at the ruins of Derwent from the banks of the reservoir, rather than walking on the mud, which can be dangerous. Derwent before it was flooded to make way for Ladybower Reservoir Edale Mountain Rescue said they had already saved one man who was stuck up to his chest for almost two hours. Dr Rowe said: ""It's exciting and interesting; come and have a look but appreciate the risk.

"A warning has been issued about a potentially dangerous batch of cocaine following the death of a man. Essex Police said the 22-year-old and a woman, 20, both from Colchester, were taken to hospital at 02:50 GMT after becoming unwell at a property in Egerton Green Road in the town. The man later died and his death is being treated as unexplained, a spokesperson for the force added. The woman remains in hospital in a stable condition. Two men, a 20-year-old from Elmstead and a 35-year-old from Colchester, were arrested at the scene on suspicion of drugs offences and remain in police custody.

""I have concerns for the safety of anyone whom may have bought cocaine in Colchester or surrounding areas in the last 24 hours or so, and would appeal to you not to take it.""

"European Council President Donald Tusk has recommended that the EU approve the Brexit deal at a summit on Sunday. It comes after Spanish PM Pedro Sanchez received assurances from the UK government over Gibraltar, and dropped his threat to boycott the summit. He said he had received the written guarantees he needed over Spain's role in the future of the British territory. UK Prime Minister Theresa May has arrived in Brussels and held talks with top EU officials, ahead of the summit. Meanwhile, former UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said the UK would become a ""satellite state"" under the deal. 'Junk the backstop' - Boris Johnson Brexit: A really simple guide What happens if MPs reject Brexit deal? The UK is scheduled to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. The terms of the UK's withdrawal have been under negotiation since June 2016 following a referendum in which 51.9% voted to leave the EU. Even if the EU approves the deal, it still has to be passed by the UK Parliament, with many MPs having stated their opposition. Spain had raised last-minute objections ahead of the summit about how the issue of Gibraltar had been handled in the Brexit talks so far. But EU leaders secured a compromise with the Spanish prime minister, who said that Europe and the UK ""had accepted the conditions set down by Spain"" and so would ""vote in favour of Brexit"". Mr Tusk, who represents EU leaders on the world stage, said he recommended ""that we approve on Sunday the outcome of the Brexit negotiations"" in a letter to members of the European Council. He added: ""No-one has reasons to be happy. But at least at this critical time, the EU 27 has passed the test of unity and solidarity."" Mrs May met the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, and Mr Tusk for talks on Saturday evening. Then on Sunday, EU leaders will meet for the special Brexit summit. They will be asked to approve two key Brexit documents: The political declaration, which sets out what the UK and EU's relationship may be like after Brexit - outlining how things like UK-EU trade and security will work. The EU withdrawal agreement: a 585-page, legally binding document setting out the terms of the UK's exit from the EU. It covers the UK's Â£39bn ""divorce bill"", citizens' rights and the Northern Ireland ""backstop"" - a way to keep the border with the Republic of Ireland open, if trade talks stall. There is no formal vote on Sunday but the EU expects to proceed after reaching a consensus. This video can not be played What's in the political declaration? If the EU signs off the withdrawal deal, Mrs May will then need to persuade MPs in the UK Parliament to back it. A vote is expected in December.Labour, theLiberal Democrats,the SNPandthe DUPhave all said they will vote against the government's deal, as well as many Conservatives. BBC News political correspondent Ben Wrighthas said Mrs May ""faces an incredibly hard job""getting the deal passed by MPs. Spain threatened to derail the Brexit deal over concerns about its role in future trade arrangements involving Gibraltar - a British Overseas Territory with 30,000 residents. But the UK published a letter it had sent to Spain reassuring it over the withdrawal agreement. After holding emergency talks with Mr Tusk and Mr Juncker, the Spanish prime minister dropped his threat. Will EU Brexit summit crash on The Rock? Gibraltar: What's it got to do with Brexit? Mr Sanchez said: ""Gibraltar is excluded from the general negotiation of the European Union with the United Kingdom. ""This gives the chance to Spain to have direct negotiations with the United Kingdom over Gibraltar."" This video can not be played 'I will always stand by Gibraltar' - May Spain's foreign minister Josep Borrell said the assurance was""the most important"" development since the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713,external, which ceded Gibraltar to Britain. But BBC Europe correspondent Kevin Connolly said that the UK's letter does not contain anything substantially different from the withdrawal agreement. He said there was a suspicion that Spanish ministers were ""showboating a little for the domestic electorate"" on the eve of elections in Andalusia, in the south of Spain, where Gibraltar is a significant issue. Theresa May said discussions with Spain have been ""constructive and sensible"" but that the UK's position on Gibraltar will not change. She said: ""I'm proud that Gibraltar is British and I will always stand by Gibraltar."" This video can not be played Why Gibraltar is British - in 60 seconds Gibraltar's chief minister Fabian Picardo also played down Spain's claims about the UK's guarantees. He said: ""What you have heard from the Spanish prime minister was not a reflection of any new position, however much he tried to present it as such."" The former foreign secretary told Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) conference that the UK was on the verge of ""making a historic mistake"". Mr Johnson said the UK had an ""absolute duty to get this right"" and there was still time to work for a better deal. This video can not be played Boris Johnson told the DUP conference that agreeing to the Brexit deal would be an historic mistake Mrs May relies on the support of the DUP's 10 MPs in key votes because she does not have a majority in the House of Commons. The DUP has threatened to look again at the agreement with the Conservatives if the Brexit deal gets through Parliament. But Mr Johnson said it was ""absolutely vital that we keep this partnership going"" to avoid Labour coming to power. The DUP opposes the Brexit deal because of the ""backstop"" - the back-up plan to make sure a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland never happens. It will only come into effect if the UK and EU fail to agree a long-term trade deal. But the backstop would mean that Northern Ireland - but not the rest of the UK - would still follow some EU rules on things such as food products. Please upgrade your browser DUP leader Arlene Foster told her party conference that the prime minister had not been able to guarantee that the backstop would not have to be used. She urged the government to secure a better deal for Northern Ireland, adding: ""The choice is not between this deal and no deal, despite what the government spin machine may say."" Chancellor Philip Hammond insisted that the prime minister's Brexit deal is better than remaining in the EU. He said the deal respected the result of the 2016 referendum and offered ""the best compromise possible"". He added that he was hopeful of a solution with the DUP. This video can not be played Michael: ""What in your honest opinion is better for the UK, your deal or the deal we had if we stayed in the EU?"" On Friday, the PM said the UK should not hope for a ""better deal"" from the EU if MPs reject her Brexit agreement.

"Thousands of migrants are now waiting at the border in Mexico Mexico's incoming foreign minister has said discussions on how to deal with migrants travelling to the United States are continuing despite reports a deal has been reached. Marcelo Ebrard denied reaching an agreement which would see asylum seekers waiting in Mexico while their claims were processed in US courts. Mr Ebrard's words seem to contradict US President Donald Trump's latest tweet. He said migrants would not be allowed entry until their claims were approved. ""Migrants at the Southern Border will not be allowed into the United States untiltheir claims are individually approved in court,"" Mr Trump wrote,external, adding: ""No 'releasing' into the US.

The conflicting statements emerged after the Washington Post reported Mexican officials had agreed to let migrants trying to enter the US stay in Mexico while their asylum claims were heard. According to the newspaper, the plan was called ""Remain in Mexico"". But Mr Ebrard, who will become foreign minister in December after Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's administration takes power, said the US had yet to even send ""a specific proposal"" on how to deal with the issue. He said conversations were still taking place with Washington. There are fears migrants could be stuck in temporary shelters for months Incoming Interior Minister Olga Sanchez Cordero also told news agency Reuters no agreement had been reached - although the Washington Post article initially quoted her as saying it was a ""short term solution"" to deal with the migrant caravan. Thousands of migrants - including women and children - are currently at the US-Mexico border after travelling more than 4,000km (2,500 miles) from Central America.

"Theresa May has written a letter to the British public pleading for their support for her Brexit deal, as the EU prepares to sign it off. The prime minister said her agreement promises a ""brighter future"" for the UK and leaving the EU next year will be ""a moment of renewal and reconciliation for our whole country"". EU leaders are in Brussels for a summit to decide whether to endorse the deal. European Council chief Donald Tusk has recommended all countries approve it. The president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, said saying goodbye to the UK was ""not a moment of jubilation"" but a ""tragedy"" for the EU. He added that, although this was the ""best possible deal"" for both sides, there were ""no smooth divorces"". Spain - which had threatened to boycott the summit - will attend after a last-minute disagreement over Gibraltar was resolved on Saturday. However, even if the EU agrees to the deal, it needs to be passed by the UK Parliament. Many MPs -  including in Mrs May's own Conservative Party - have stated they will vote against it. Brexit: A really simple guide What happens if MPs reject Brexit deal? The five Brexit questions everyone's asking Google In Mrs May's ""letter to the nation"" - published on the eve of the EU summit where she hopes the 27 other EU countries will back her deal - the PM claims the deal is ""in our national interest"" and works for all parts of the UK.

But not the end of the arguments Theresa May has to make about our relationship with the rest of the continent. Today - Number 10 hopes - marks the end of months and years of negotiations, not just with Brussels. But, with a bigger aspiration: to bring the country together. But, while a deal is expected to be signed off in Brussels today, whatever the last minute jitters, Theresa May will know, pitching her agreement to the EU is one thing, persuading Parliament another, and ultimately what will determine her and all of our futures is whether the public is willing to come on board.

Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar said the negotiations had been ""very difficult"" but the deal reached would allow for the UK's ""orderly withdrawal"".

Labour, the Liberal Democrats, the SNP and the DUP have all said they will vote against the government's deal, as well as many Conservatives.

He said there was a suspicion that Spanish ministers were ""showboating a little for the domestic electorate"" on the eve of elections in the south of Spain.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson told the DUP conference that agreeing to the Brexit deal would be an historic mistake The UK is on the verge of making a historic mistake if it does not ""junk the backstop"", Boris Johnson has said. He told the DUP conference the EU had made NI an ""indispensable bargaining chip"" in the Brexit negotiations. DUP leader Arlene Foster said a Brexit deal that includes the backstop plan is ""not in the national interest"". There has been political opposition among unionists to the government's plan because of the backstop, which aims to avoid a hard Irish border. It would see only Northern Ireland stay aligned to some EU rules if it took effect. European Council President Donald Tusk has recommended that the EU approve the Brexit deal at a summit on Sunday. The DUP is concerned that the backstop could threaten the integrity of the union and place a trade border down the Irish Sea. Brexit deal: NI business and farming community reacts to proposals Reality Check: Brexit withdrawal agreement - what it all means Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Mr Johnson is one of two senior Conservative MPs to appear at the conference this weekend, after Chancellor Philip Hammond spoke on Friday night. ""We must agree that neither side will introduce a hard border in Northern Ireland,"" he said. The former foreign secretary said the UK had an ""absolute duty to get this right"" and that there is still time to work for a better deal. ""In the words of that great Northern Irish singer Van Morrison, it is time we all moved from the dark end of the street to the bright side of the road,"" he added, to applause. He said he hoped the DUP and Conservatives could continue working together, ""backing our union against all those who would seek to divide us"". by Jayne McCormack, BBC News NI political reporter What do Star Wars, sardines and the Titanic all have in common? Answer: They all somehow ended up getting a mention in Boris Johnson's speech at the DUP conference (yes, really). It certainly wasn't a normal party conference, but these are unusual times. There was standing room only as the politician, who often brings a rock star flavour to events, took to the stage. That being said, while much of what he said received roars of applause, my colleague Gareth Gordon noticed one woman asleep in the front row. But even getting Mr Johnson to appear at the conference will be seen as a victory for the DUP, in its attempt to resist the government's path for Brexit. Before party leader Arlene Foster was announced to the stage, one DUP councillor described her as ""a lady who's not for turning"". But with Theresa May also holding firm against the DUP's opposition to the backstop so far, soon enough someone's going to have to give. Mr Johnson also suggested the creation of a secretary of state for ""no deal"" on World Trade Organisation terms, ""with real powers across Whitehall to make things happen"". ""I do not believe that we will exit without a deal - that is totally unnecessary - but it is only responsible of government to make the proper preparations,"" he added. Mrs Foster told her party's conference that the prime minister had not been able to guarantee that the backstop would not have to be used. The government has said it is looking at alternative arrangements to ensure the backstop is a last resort. This video can not be played Brexit: Arlene Foster says choice 'not between this deal and no deal' But, Mrs Foster said there were ""many contradictions"" in the draft withdrawal agreement. She said she understood the position of many in the business community, who have urged DUP MPs to back the deal. But she added that the party could not wish away proposals that it believes are not in the best interests of Northern Ireland's economy or interests. ""The choice is not between this deal and no deal, despite what the government spin machine may say,"" she said. Ahead of the party conference, Mrs Foster warned that if the deal gets passed in parliament, her party may have to revisit its confidence-and-supply pact with the Conservatives. The DUP holds the balance of power at Westminster, as the government relies on the votes of its 10 MPs to have a working majority in parliament. It signed a confidence and supply pact with the Conservatives in June 2017 and negotiated an extra Â£1bn in spending for Northern Ireland - but the rift between the parties over the Brexit plan has put the arrangement under significant pressure. On Saturday, she said ""the DUP had never been afraid to say yes when it is right to do so, nor to say no when required"". Earlier, the DUP's deputy leader Nigel Dodds said the party would ""stand firm in the face of inevitable onslaught"" in opposing the government's Brexit plan. Mr Dodds told the party's conference: ""Prime minister - bin the backstop."" Nigel Dodds was addressing the Democratic Unionist Party conference Mr Dodds told the conference that the union is ""non-negotiable"". He described Theresa May's draft plan as portraying a ""pitiful and pathetic place for the United Kingdom"". The government has insisted that it will not renegotiate the current plan, and has urged MPs to back it or risk a no deal scenario. Mr Dodds added that the DUP wanted to leave the EU with a deal, but ""not a deal at any price"". Philip Hammond had a series of engagements in Northern Ireland on Friday before attending the DUP conference On Friday, the Chancellor, Philip Hammond, told the BBC that the government is looking at ways to provide extra assurances to the DUP over the Irish border backstop. He was speaking during a visit to an integrated school in Moira, County Down. The government of Gibraltar is also represented at the DUP conference. Gibraltar has become involved in the Brexit debateas Spain sought written assurances from the UK that it would be directly consulted over its future trade negotiations with the EU which relate to Gibraltar, a British Overseas Territory. This video can not be played Brexit agreement: What does the 585-page document say? Donald Tusk recommended that the EU approve the Brexit deal after Spanish PM Pedro Sanchez received assurances from the UK government over Gibraltar, and dropped his threat to boycott the summit. On Saturday, the government of Gibraltar said the territory ""will not fold"" over Brexit and staunchly supports the union. Housing and equality minister Samantha Sacramento told the DUP conference Gibraltar would ""not be bullied"". The chief minister of Gibraltar, Fabian Picardo, was due to attend but could not make it because of the ongoing Brexit negotiations. Gibraltar voted overwhelmingly (96%) to remain in the EU.

"Ex-President Robert Mugabe went to vote in July's elections with his wife Grace (left) Zimbabwe's former President Mugabe, 94, is unable to walk because of ill health, President Emmerson Mnangagwa has said. Mr Mugabe has been in Singapore for treatment for an undisclosed illness for the past two months, he added. The former president also made several medical trips there towards the end of his time in power. Mr Mnangagwa became head of state a year ago afterMr Mugabe was ousted following the intervention of the army. Up to that point, Mr Mugabe had been in power for 37 years, first as prime minister, then as president. He led the movement for Zimbabwean independence from white minority rule. President Emmerson Mnangagwa told supporters that his predecessor would be back in the country next week President Mnangagwa was addressing a rally in his predecessor's home area when he talked about the former leader's health. ""He is now old. Of course, he now is unable to walk but whatever he asks for we will provide,"" the AFP news agency quotes him as saying. When Mr Mugabe was in power officials said he was being treated for eye problems, denying rumours that he had cancer. Despite being unable to walk, Mr Mnangagwa said the former leader was feeling better and would be back in the country next week. ""We are looking after him. He is the founding father of the nation of Zimbabwe. He is our founding father of free Zimbabwe,"" the president added, AFP reports. The government is paying for Mr Mugabe's treatment.

"This video can not be played Football final postponed after team bus attack A ""shameful"" attack on the Boca Juniors team bus by River Plate supporters has led to the postponement of the final of the Copa Libertadores second leg. The game between the two fierce Argentine rivals will now take place on Sunday at 20:00 GMT in Buenos Aires, 24 hours later than originally scheduled. The announcement -made by River Plate on Twitter,external- came after more than two hours of confusion at River's Monumental stadium, during which the kick-off was put back twice - first to 21:00 GMT and then to 22:15 GMT. Boca players suffered cuts from the glass from broken windows and were also affected by the tear gas used by police to disperse the crowds. A number of players, including Boca's former Manchester City, Manchester United and Juventus striker Carlos Tevez, reportedly suffered from dizziness and vomiting and were being treated by club doctors. Boca Juniors midfielder Pablo Perez (centre) and defender Leonardo Balerdi were pictured wearing eye patches Footage apparently from inside the Boca dressing room showed the players groggy and disorientated. Reports said Boca's Pablo Perez and Gonzalo Lamardo had been taken by ambulance to hospital, the former with slivers of broken glass in his eyes and the latter a cut on his head. ""Pablo has just returned from hospital and has a bandage on his eye,"" Tevez told reporters before the postponement was confirmed. ""Other team-mates have cuts. We've only just been able to breathe well because we were affected by the gas. We can't play like this,"" he added. ""In these conditions the game was distorted. One team couldn't play and the other doesn't want to play against a rival that isn't in the right conditions,"" explained Alejandro Dominguez, the head of South American football's governing body, Conmebol. ""This should shame us as a society and I find it very sad that we have to reschedule such an important match,"" said Boca president Daniel Angelici. ""It's not easy to take this decision when there are 60,000 people in the stadium and the television rights have been sold to a ton of countries. But the most important thing is to look after the physical and psychological condition of the team."" River president Rodolfo D'Onofrio added: ""As an Argentine and as a football leader, I find this shameful. [But] it's the right decision and we hope to be able to play in peace on Sunday."" The attack occurred as the team made its way to River's Estadio Monumental in Buenos Aires for the second leg of the final. Last week's first leg at Boca's groundended in a 2-2 draw. Former Argentina striker Gabriel Batistuta,externalalso branded the scenes ""shameful"", saying on Twitter: ""Another opportunity lost in front of the whole world that observes us, shameful, lamentable."" The Copa Libertadores is the showpiece club competition in South America, equivalent to the Champions League in Europe. The clubs had agreed to a ban on away fans which mirrors an existing ban in domestic football in Argentina. Three years ago, a last-16 Copa tie between River and Boca at the latter's La Bombonera ground was abandoned at half-time after Boca fans attacked the River players with pepper spray in the tunnel. Boca were kicked out of the competition, while River were given a bye into the quarter-finals. River fans were left waiting for updates inside the stadium following the attack on the Boca bus BBC Americas editor Leonardo Rocha reports: The head of South America's football confederation, Alejandro Dominguez, said several players had been injured and officials from both River Plate and Boca Juniors agreed to postpone the match. This was the most anticipated game in the history of the two Argentine football giants. They were facing each other for the first time in a big South American final. But there's a sense of frustration and embarrassment now in Buenos Aires. And concern about the prospect of further violence. The whole world was watching, wrote one of the country's main newspapers, and Argentina showed them the ugliest side of its football. There was a very heavy police presence outside the stadium World Service radio producer Richard Padula at the Estadio Monumental: It was the final nobody wanted - a rivalry too intense for a match this big. Three hours before kick-off, the stadium was almost full. The songs were loud and heartfelt. But slowly the news of the attack on the Boca team bus began to filter through. And then the pictures. No announcements, just rumours on social media. Kick-off was delayed. But, we were told, the game would go on. Time passed. Still no sign of the players or team sheets. At one stage cones and balls were laid out for the pre-match warm-up. But the warm-up never took place - and neither did the match. Overseas visitors love Argentine football. The passion, the fervour, the colour, the characters. It's easy to romanticise the game here. But for those who live with it everyday it can be tiresome, dangerous and idiotic. And now this. The Superclasico between Buenos Aires clubs River and Boca is regarded as one of the most famous derbies in world football. Their bitter rivalry dates back to when the two clubs where situated just a few miles from one another - in the city's La Boca region - between 1905 and 1923. When football in Argentina became professional in 1931, River - who had relocated to Buenos Aires' Recoleta district eight years earlier - opted to spend big on new acquisitions, earning themselves the nickname 'Los Millonarios'. River's spending only stoked the already heated rivalry between themselves and Boca, who have never left the city's working-class La Boca neighbourhood. Since then, the two clubs have collected 69 league titles between them - River have won the Argentine top flight 36 times, while Boca have 33 titles to their name. This is the first time in the 58-year history of the Copa Libertadores the two teams have faced each other in the final of the competition.

"Director Nicolas Roeg, whose films include Don't Look Now and Performance, has died at the age of 90. In a career spanning six decades, he was celebrated for his original and controversial film-making. His 1973 psychological thriller Don't Look Now caused controversy for its graphic sex scenes. Roeg also directed Mick Jagger in the crime drama Performance and David Bowie in the science fiction movie The Man Who Fell To Earth. His son, Nicolas Roeg Jr, said his father died on Friday night. ""He was a genuine dad,"" he said. ""He just had his 90th birthday in August,"" he added. Donald Sutherland, who starred in Don't Look Now and named one of his sons Roeg, paid tribute to him. ""He is a fearless visionary, always was, always will be,"" he said. ""He was a liberating joy to work for. I fell in love with him then and will love him forever."" Nicholas Roeg in London in 1991 Nicolas Roeg was one of the most original film-makers the UK has ever produced. His early experience as a cinematographer brought a stunning visual quality to his work. He often exasperated the critics and gained a reputation as being hard on his actors. And he took a delight in jumbling scenes and time to both bewitch and bewilder his audiences. Read the full obituary here Born in St John's Wood in north London in 1928, Roeg started in the film industry making tea and operating the clapper board at Marylebone Studios. His directorial debut came in 1970 when he filmed Performance, sharing the director's role with Donald Cammell. The explicit scenes of violence and drug-taking caused the film's release to be delayed by two years. Speaking to the BBC's Front Row in 2013, he said false rumours that Don't Look Now included a real sex scene were ""very flattering"" because it meant audiences thought the film was authentic. ""What you are looking for in anything is some sort of truth,"" he said. Edgar Wright, the British director of Shaun of the Dead and Baby Driver, was among those who paid tribute to ""a master of the art"". Allow Twitter content?

"Anne argues societal innate inequalities mean that splitting the bill isn't fair Anne Rucchetto, 27, is a writer living in Toronto, Canada. As part of the BBC's 100 Women series, she writes about why it matters who picks up the bill. When I first began dating, my mother warned me that there was ""no such thing as a free drink"". She would elaborate gravely: ""Men will think you owe them something."" I know my mother didn't mean to fill me with dread, but her statement left me troubled each time I met someone new. It took me time to relinquish the sense of obligation I felt to men who covered the cost of my $5 beer - but since then, I've never looked back. As someone who's been dating since the age of 14, I've spent a lot of time thinking and talking about ways to find a great partner, as well as what behaviours to look for when meeting someone for the first time. These days finding a date is easier than ever, with apps and online communities for people of every conceivable orientation, identity, and background. But who should pay for the first date always sparks a spirited conversation. US 'dine-and-dash' dater sentenced Aiming high key to online dating success 'I transitioned and lost my male privilege' I used to embrace the logic that for women to be treated as equal to men, we should pay for our own share, and split the bill with our date. To make sure that's never a problem, I've always suggested affordable dating venues - cheap and cheerful restaurants, dive bars, gigs, parks. About five years ago my friends and teachers introduced me to ideas that made me question that approach. I became aware of feminist writers like Gloria Jean Watkins (known by her pen name bell hooks) who made me think about who benefits most from the current structure of society. She and others got me thinking about the way power functions at the every level, including small individual exchanges. People benefit differently based on the current structure of society, so depending on who we're spending time with, it shouldn't be expected for both parties to pay equal amounts. Women, on average, earn less than men.Canadian women, on average, earn C$0.69 for every dollar a man makes,externalat work. This doesn't mean that our cost of living is cheaper - in many cases, it can be more expensive. The woman who draws Tinder dates Your worst dating app experiences Expectations around women's appearances and behaviour have material and personal costs. Women's physical appearances are held to impossibly high standards and a routine subject of ridicule everywhere from the entertainment industry to The White House. We are expected to be calmer, more attentive, understanding, flexible, and accommodating than men in every area of our lives - in family, work, relationships, and friendships. Meeting these norms is costly - materially and emotionally. Furthermore, who pays cannot be reduced to an issue of men versus women. We all have different experiences based on our gender, social and economic status, race, citizenship, and more. Ultimately, equality is not the same as equity. Equality is everyone getting the exact same pair of shoes. Equity is everyone getting a pair of shoes that fits them. In good relationships, people will strive for equity. When I went on a first date with a man who spent most of the time boasting about his sports car and travels, it confused me when he wanted to split the bill. Curiously, it is often these privileged men that have declared to my friends and I: ""I'm a feminist, so we'll split it"" Whether or not men believe women's labour is underpaid, it is. Further, whether or not men agree with women being underpaid, they directly benefit from it. This isn't to say that men don't work hard or should always pay - when I've been in situations where it is obvious that I have more income than the man I'm dating, I am happy to split or cover the bill. If I sense that a man correlates his paying for a first date with me ""owing"" him in some way, I will insist on paying for both of us and shut down any chance of further communication. This kind of primitive thinking shows a lack of perspective, respect, and consent. I have dated both men and women, and funnily enough, anytime I've dated a woman, or gender-diverse person we've ended up competing to pay the bill. I've been with my partner, Zac, for over a year now. I had a good feeling about him when he told me he loved animals, described his appreciation for his friends, and shared his views about labour rights. He paid for our first date and I paid for our second. Now, we share expenses based on what we can afford when we go out together or visit each other's homes. This might change in the future, but we've found a balance that works for both of us. Our most important goal is to make sure that both of us feel respected and that neither of us feel underappreciated or taken advantage of. First dates are one small opportunity to recognise that people in society have different access to resources. If we want to be good company and good partners, challenging power imbalances is an important part of every relationship. Who pays on a first date doesn't define the terms of the relationship. As bonds develop, the people involved can work to find terms that suit them. Regardless of the expectations we might have about who should (or shouldn't) pay on a first date, it's always good to be considerate.

"Nicole, now in her mid-40s, reflects on experiencing early menopause Nicole Evans was diagnosed with premature menopause at the age of 30. She writes for BBC 100 Women about the shock of infertility and how she has come to terms with the diagnosis. My periods had been getting lighter for a couple of years, but when I mentioned it to health workers here in my native New Zealand they brushed it off as a natural effect of the pill. When one month I missed a period altogether, I went to the doctor excited that I might be pregnant. I had been married for a year and we had just started talking about having a baby. But the pregnancy test came back negative. My doctor got blood tests done, and brought me back to explain my hormone levels weren't normal. She referred me to a hormone specialist and I was diagnosed with premature menopause. I didn't know ovaries could stop working at this age - it came as an incredible shock. Today's feminism tells us we can have it all and we should want it all, on our terms and in our timeframe. But this lie costs us greatly when circumstances interfere with the path we had planned. Nicole on her wedding day with her partner I believe celebrity culture has a lot to answer for when it comes to fertility awareness. When a woman's fertility is, directly or indirectly, erroneously portrayed as something that easily continues into her 50s, signs of problems are easy to overlook. I had no idea that, generally speaking,female fertility starts to decline in your mid 30s,external. We decided to go through a donor egg IVF cycle with a wonderful friend and felt very hopeful and expected it to be the answer to all our problems. But we ended up with only one viable embryo to transfer and that didn't lead to a pregnancy. It was extremely upsetting for everyone involved. 'I went through the menopause at 11' High carb diet may hasten menopause Staff urged to say 'menopause' more often A year later another friend offered to help us, but this time I was very hesitant. It would be the last government-funded cycle, and psychologically I felt safer in between treatment. In the midst of fertility treatment it can take a great deal of courage simply to walk out the door each morning. But we gave the second cycle a go because I was now aged 32. Time was marching on. Menopause is the biological stage in a woman's life that occurs when she stops having periods Periods can become less frequent over months or years before the stop Other symptoms include hot flushes, poor concentration, headaches, anxiety, reduced sex drive and difficulty sleeping Menopause usually occurs between the ages of 45 and 55 - the UK average is 51 About one in every 100 women under the age of 40 go through premature menopause, also known as premature ovarian insufficiency Source:NHS UK,external Sadly the two separate embryo transfers we did from this cycle didn't become pregnancies either, and we didn't have the financial or emotional resources to invest in a third cycle. I couldn't face adoption. Having just finished being poked and prodded physically, I would then have to start on a journey of more prodding - into our relationship, jobs, home life, finances - as part of a gruelling vetting process. Of course I understood why it was necessary, but I just couldn't face it on top of the trauma I'd already experienced. I hit rock bottom. The emotional heartache for the loss of our potential children was there no matter how hard we tried to rationalise it away. And this heartache remained for me until one particular evening. I'd spent it with a girlfriend and her newborn, and after she left I noticed that the longing to have a baby of my own was gone. Simply erased. I couldn't explain it other than I believe God took away the longing deep in my heart. And looking back now I know it's because he had something better planned for me - a closer relationship with him. A great number of doctors seem to be unaware of premature menopause. I've spoken to many women in the support group I run who, when they tell their doctor their periods have become irregular, are only referred to specialists after a delay, if at all. I have been on HRT ever since I was diagnosed. I'm very grateful for this treatment because even in your early 40s, as I now am, it's very hard to discuss menopausal hot flushes, moodiness and brain fog with anyone. You feel too embarrassed to say anything because you feel you have to explain yourself to any age group. It's a nice bonus to be rid of the expense and the hassle of sanitary products each month. But it's taken me a while to recognise silver linings like this. I believe the ageing-averse, hardship-averse culture of the West hinders us from dealing well with natural life processes. We have become so good at distracting ourselves from hard realities, feeding ourselves comforting lies, that we have a very narrow idea of what makes a truly satisfying life. Premature menopause may have given me much heartache, but it also uncovered the deception that true satisfaction is found in health and youth and perfection. Our infertility journey was a life crisis and our world had to be rebuilt from the ground up, but it has certainly made us stronger both individually and as a couple. It taught us many lessons: that our true identity transcends our circumstances; to count our blessings; to have more compassion for others; and to approach life with an open mind, to name a few. We may not have it all, but we have everything we need. BBC 100 Womennames 100 influential and inspirational women around the world every year and shares their stories.
