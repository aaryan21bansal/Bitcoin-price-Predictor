"The legal action follows months of disputes between the two sides The European Union has launched legal action against the coronavirus vaccine manufacturer AstraZeneca. The European Commission - the EU's executive branch - said it was suing the company for not respecting its vaccine supply contract, and for not having a ""reliable"" plan to ensure timely deliveries. AstraZeneca said the move was ""without merit"". It said it would ""strongly defend itself in court"". The legal action marks an escalation in a long-running dispute between the two sides over the supply of coronavirus vaccines. Some in the bloc have claimed that AstraZeneca has shown preferential treatment to the UK - but the company has denied this. Why is the EU unhappy with AstraZeneca? Covid map: Where are cases the highest? EU hints at summer return for US travellers Meanwhile, the US has announced thatit will share up to 60 million doses of its AstraZeneca vaccine with other countries as they become available.The doses will be able to be exported in the coming months after a federal safety review, AP news agency reports. A European Commission spokesman said the action was launched on Friday, with the backing of all 27 member states. It stems from a deal the commission signed last August for 300 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, with an option for 100 million more. Earlier this year, AstraZeneca said its supplies would be reduced because of production problems. Of 80 million doses planned for delivery in the first quarter of 2021, only about 30 million were sent. According to the European Commission, the company is set to provide 70 million doses in the second quarter of 2021 instead of the 180 million that were initially arranged. ""The terms of the contract, or some terms of the contract, have not been respected,"" the spokesman said. ""We want to make sure that there's a speedy delivery of a sufficient number of doses... which have been promised on the basis of the contract."" Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides tweeted that the commission's priority was to ""ensure Covid-19 vaccine deliveries take place to protect the health of the European Union"". ""Every vaccine dose counts. Every vaccine dose saves lives,"" she wrote. One EU official told Reuters news agency that the move was taken to ""send a message"" to AstraZeneca's chief executive Pascal Soriot. Percent of people fully vaccinated Please upgrade your browser to see the full interactive This information is regularly updated but may not reflect the latest totals or vaccines administered for each location. Total doses may include booster doses in addition to those required for full vaccination. The definition of full vaccination varies by location and vaccine type and is subject to change over time. Full vaccination can refer to a person receiving all required doses of a specific vaccine or sometimes recovery from infection plus one dose of a vaccine. Definitions have not yet been updated to account for booster campaigns to control the spread of new variants. Some locations may reach vaccination rates over 100%, such as Gibraltar, due to population estimates that are lower than the number of people who have now been vaccinated in that place. Source: Our World in Data Last updated: 5 July 2022, 13:28 BST In a statement responding to the announcement, AstraZeneca said it had ""fully complied"" with its agreement with the EU, and hoped to resolve the dispute as soon as possible. ""Following an unprecedented year of scientific discovery, very complex negotiations, and manufacturing challenges, our company is about to deliver almost 50m doses to European countries by the end of April, in line with our forecast,"" the British-Swedish company said. ""We are making progress addressing the technical challenges and our output is improving, but the production cycle of a vaccine is very long which means these improvements take time to result in increased finished vaccine doses,"" the statement read. AstraZeneca had previously said that the contract obliged the company to make its ""best effort"" to meet EU demand, without compelling it to stick to a specific timetable. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson's spokesman told reporters he was unaware of the specifics around the legal action. He said AstraZeneca had been a ""hugely strong partner for the UK and in fact, globally, for the work they're doing"". Under the contract, any legal action would need to be resolved by Belgian courts. The EU originally planned to use AstraZeneca as the main vaccine in its rollout, but following the supply issues, the bloc now relies mostly on the Pfizer-BioNTech jab. Despite vaccine delays, the EU is still aiming for ""a minimum of 70% of the entire adult population"" to have received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine by this summer. The announcement of legal action on Monday came as some countries began to ease restrictions. Millions of French children returned to the classroom, as primary schools and nurseries reopened following a three-week shutdown. In Italy, restaurants and bars in much of the country were allowed to serve customers outside, while hairdressers in Belgium reopened their doors. Meanwhile, the mayor of the Spanish city of Pamplona announced that the annual SanfermÃ­n fiesta in July - with its famous running of the bulls - would be cancelled for a second year. Outside of the EU, Turkey announced a coronavirus lockdown until 17 May in a bid to curb a surge in coronavirus cases and deaths.

"Greek islands such as Mykonos are proving popular, says Thomas Cook People are increasingly putting off their summer holidays and booking autumn breaks instead due to uncertainty over international travel, tour operators say. Thomas Cook said autumn bookings were up 50% on normal levels, while luxury tour operator Kuoni said customers were ""holding out for October half term"". Greece and the Caribbean are among the most popular destinations. But some fear prices will rise due to fewer countries being open to tourism. International travel is due to resume from 17 May under the government's roadmap to reopening, with plans for a ""traffic-light"" system categorising different countries. However, the list of countries that Britons can travel to will not be known until nearer 17 May and will be subject to change. This has prompted a surge in autumn holiday bookings, with breaks in September and October accounting for 30% of Thomas Cook's live bookings for the year. That is up 50% on what the group normally sees in these months. A spokesman said there was a ""clear preference for September and October compared to what we normally expect"". He said many people had already booked domestic breaks for July and August and were looking for a ""week of sun in the Med"" later in the year. ""Devon is lovely, but Devon in October is not Devon in July,"" he added. Holiday bookings jump despite 'unclear rules' EasyJet sees summer holiday bookings surge 250% According to Thomas Cook, Greece is the most popular destination for autumn breaks, with Rhodes the most in-demand island followed by Crete, Santorini and Mykonos. The Canary Islands, a popular winter-sun destination, are the second most popular destination. Kuoni did not share booking figures but said the majority of 2021 sales have been from October onwards. It added that customers were ""saving and upgrading"" for long-haul winter sun breaks. Antigua is another popular destination ""We've chatted to lots of customers who have written off any hope of getting away in the summer but are holding out for October half-term,"" the company said. Its most popular destinations are the Maldives and the Caribbean, including Antigua, Barbados and Saint Lucia. Other travel firms are seeing evidence of the trend in searches on their websites. British Airways Holidays said there was a lot of ""pent-up demand"" for foreign holidays and it has seen a spike in searches for trips to long-haul beach destinations this autumn. Searches for December holidays have also seen a ""notable increase"", with New York proving popular. Meanwhile travel deals website Travelzoo predicts September and October will be ""big months for travel"". A survey of 2,000 of its members carried out last week found the majority said they plan to take a trip around that time. However, the company warned that prices could increase if demand continues and there is a limited number of destinations open for travel. ""Right now we are seeing some good prices for September and October, but there's every indication it will start to prove more challenging for [package-holiday customers],"" the company said. Under the government's proposed traffic-light system, counties will be categorised as red, amber or green depending their infection rates, vaccination coverage and the prevalence of variants of concern. Covid testing and quarantine requirements will vary from category to category. All passengers will have to take Covid tests before leaving and on returning - even from low-risk ""green"" countries. There will also be a green ""watchlist"" which will identify countries that are most at risk of moving from green to amber. Covid cases in some European countries remain high and vaccination programmes in the bloc have lagged behind the UK. The Association of Independent Tour Operators said: ""Would-be travellers are nervous without certainty. We need those government traffic lights to be confirmed to give us all confidence.""

"Ajay and Atul Gupta have been sanctioned, along with their brother Rajesh, accused of corruption in South Africa The UK has imposed sanctions on 22 individuals, 14 of them Russians, involved in notorious corruption cases under a new anti-corruption regime. Individuals across South Africa, South Sudan and Latin America were also targeted with the asset freezes and travel bans. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told MPs the UK had an important role to play in combating corruption. He also described the country as a ""honey pot"" for ""corrupt actors"". The new regime means individuals ""involved in some of the world's most serious cases of corruption"" will no longer be able to channel their money through UK banks or enter the country, a statement from the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office said. Sanctions were imposed on people from six countries, including: 14 Russians involved in a massive tax fraud uncovered by the lawyer,Sergei Magnitsky, who later died in custody Three businessmen - the brothers Ajay, Atul and Rajesh Gupta - accused of serious corruption in South Africa Sudanese businessman Ashraf Seed Ahmed Hussein Ali - dubbed Al Cardinal - accused of misappropriating state assets in South Sudan And three individuals accused of serious corruption in Honduras, Nicaragua and Guatemala This is the first time the UK has imposed sanctions for international corruption. Russian lawyer Sergei Magnitsky died in prison after revealing tax fraud Announcing the sanctions in the House of Commons, Mr Raab said: ""Corruption has an immensely corrosive effect on the rule of law, on trust in institutions, it slows development, it drains the wealth of poorer nations, it keeps their people trapped in poverty. It poisons the well of democracy around the world."" He added: ""Our status as a global financial centre makes us an attractive location for investment... but it also makes us a honey pot, a lightning rod for corrupt actors who seek to launder their dirty money through British banks or through British businesses."" Mr Raab said the new sanctions regime, taken partly in tandem with measures in the US, would provide ""an additional powerful tool to hold the corrupt to account"". Labour welcomed the announcement, but said law enforcement needed the resources to support investigations, describing the current rate of prosecutions for economic crime as ""woefully low"". Shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy said: ""If he's serious about what he's saying today he needs to put his money where his mouth is."" She also criticised a ""tangled network of financial interests and cosy relationships in the heart of government"". ""We need to know that this announcement isn't just a gloss on the surface of a grubby system which underneath signals business as usual,"" she said. Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken backed the new regime, as the country also introduced its own corruption sanctions. He said: ""Together, along with other allies and partners, we will seek to promote our shared values with similar tools. Corrupt actors, and their facilitators, will not have access to our financial systems."" More than 2% of global GDP is lost to corruption every year, and corruption increases the cost of doing business for individual companies by as much as 10%, according to government figures. ""Corruption also threatens our national security by exacerbating conflict and facilitating serious and organised crime, creating space for terrorist and criminal groups like Daesh and Boko Haram to operate,"" a Foreign Office statement said. It added: ""This new regime will allow the UK to combat serious corruption, in particular bribery and misappropriation. It will promote effective governance, robust democratic institutions and the rule of law - demonstrating our power as a force for good around the world.""

"This video can not be played Pubs and restaurants reopen for the first time in four months Shops, gyms, swimming pools, pubs, restaurants and cafes in Scotland have reopened after a four month-long winter lockdown. Early morning queues formed at fashion retailers in Glasgow and Edinburgh as shoppers waited for doors opening. Travel restrictions have also been eased, allowing trips to other parts of the UK for non-essential reasons. Ministers say restrictions can be eased as the most vulnerable people have been offered their first vaccine dose. Scotland has been in level four lockdown since 26 December, with all non-essential shops, leisure facilities, and hospitality venues closed. New draft hospitality Covid guidance a 'bombshell' How many people are not taking the Covid vaccine? Driving lessons and tests can resume, while nail salons, museums and holiday accommodation can also reopen. As the mainland moves into level three restrictions many businesses will still be subject to strict rules on capacity and social distancing. Unlike England, pubs and restaurants will be able open indoors until 20:00 - but they will only be able to serve alcohol to customers seated outside. Queues formed on Glasgow's Argyle Street early on Monday ahead of the shops reopening A number of shops across Scotland opened early to mark the easing of restrictions with queues outside many larger retailers. Braehead Shopping Centre near Glasgow opened at 07:00, with some customers outside for an hour beforehand. Katie Moody, of the city's Princes Square shopping centre, said: ""People do seem a bit more comfortable about coming out this time. ""Glaswegians love to shop, we have seen queues in the city and I think there are just some things you want to experience in person and we are giving them that back."" In Inverness, restaurateur Norman MacDonald MBE opened his Cafe 1 restaurant for the first time since Christmas Eve. He said: ""It is great we are open, and the team is back in and champing at the bit to look after their customers."" Lush on Edinburgh's Princes Street had a small queue waiting. Manager Alan Brown said: ""We're just really excited to be speaking to people again after such a long time."" Liz Cameron from the Scottish Chamber of Commerce said the excitement was ""fantastic"" for businesses. She added: ""We must remember it's been a long time, and we have a lot of costs we have to be able to recoup and it will not happen in a day or a week. ""It's the start of our journey but let's remember this is about trying to save as many jobs as possible. "" Friends enjoyed the chance to meet up over a pint outside the Three Sisters in Edinburgh Small groups of people, some with blankets over their laps, gathered for post-work drinks on Edinburgh's George Street Early pub customers enjoy an outside drink in Glasgow city centre Public Health expert Prof Devi Sridhar said infection numbers were low enough to support the opening up of a large part of society. She told BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotland: ""The end is in sight within weeks. We can see the full adult population getting vaccines by the summer."" She said Covid testing would also make a difference. ""I would really encourage people to get tested both the PCR and at home lateral flow testing,"" she added. ""The safest way to keep bars and pubs and indoor hospitality open is to make sure that nobody inside is infectious."" Up to six people from two households can socialise indoors in a public place such as a cafÃ© or restaurant Unrestricted travel within Scotland, England and Wales (subject to other local restrictions in place) All shops and close contact services (like nail salons and tattoo parlours) can open Hospitality venues like cafes, pubs and restaurants can open until 20:00 indoors (no alcohol) They can serve alcohol outdoors according to local licensing laws Non-essential childcare permitted Non-essential in-house work (like painter and decorators) permitted Tourist accommodation to reopen (self-catering accommodation to be restricted in line with rules on indoor gathering) Driving lessons and tests can take place Funerals and weddings including wakes and receptions can take place with up to 50 people (alcohol permitted) Gyms and swimming pools can reopen for individual exercise Indoor attractions and public buildings such as galleries, museums and libraries can open Takeaway food can be collected indoors Rapid testing kits are being madeavailable to everyone in the country.The lateral flow tests can be picked up without an appointment from walk-in or drive through test sites from 15:30 every day. And the Scottish government is launching a new app - Check In Scotland - making it easier for businesses to collect contact tracing details. Among those reopening their business is Barry Cowan from The Walled Garden Touring Park, near Maybole in Ayrshire. He had to open his gates four hours earlier than usual to meet demand. He said the caravan park would be operating at half capacity so holiday-makers have more space.  But with restrictions on foreign travel still in place, Mr Cowan is booked into August and September. ""We can't wait, we're really, really excited and we're sure we're going to have a good season,"" he said. Kurt McGonigle is excited about reopening his tattoo studio Hepcat Tattoos in Glasgow is one of the ""close contact businesses"" that will be open for the first time in four months. Pent-up demand means most of Kurt McGonigle's tattooists are booked up for months to come. ""We were closed for four months so most of our income stopped, so we're all really excited to be going back to work and get back to normal,"" Mr McGonigle said. Steven Annand wants to see people able to enjoy alcohol inside pubs and restaurants Steve Annand, of drinks wholesaler Inverarity Morton, said the lifting of lockdown was ""a bit of light at the end of the tunnel - but there's still a good way to travel before we're back to normal levels"". Permitting bars and restaurants to serve drinks indoors will be the key to rebuilding after a ""really difficult"" few months. ""I think we need to get back to enjoying alcohol inside, in an indoor environment, in bars and restaurants,"" he said.

"This video can not be played 'You take the small things for granted' People in Wales have been visiting pubs and restaurants for the first time in almost five months. From Monday, pubs, cafes and restaurants in Wales are able to reopen to customers outdoors. Up to six people from six households are now able to meet, with social distancing and hygiene measures in place. Outdoor attractions, such as zoos and theme parks, can also reopen under the latest easing of lockdown. Wedding receptions and funerals can again be held outdoors at regulated premises with up to 30 people. What are the latest lockdown rules in Wales? Friends reunited as restrictions ease Organised outdoor activities, such as sport activities limited to 30 people, are also able to resume. Protests are also now allowed but will need to be organised by a ""responsible body with appropriate mitigations, including undertaking a risk assessment"". After an almost five month wait, people enjoyed a drink in this Pembrokeshire beer garden Hospitality is set to reopen indoors from 17 May, along with increased limits on those who can attend organised events, but this depends on case rates and the make-up of the Welsh government after the election on 6 May. Wales' rolling seven-day case rate is now12.9 per 100,000 people, the lowest level since 3 September. More than a fifth of peoplein Wales have now had a full Covid vaccine. Volunteers and those who are unable to work from home can alsoorder a lateral flow self-test kit to be delivered to their home,externalfrom Monday. First Minister Mark Drakeford said because ""meeting outdoors continues to be lower risk than meeting indoors"" the lockdown easing was able to go ahead. The Welsh Conservatives said it was a ""welcome but long overdue"" reopening for these sectors. Plaid Cymru said it was thanks to ""the collective effort of the people of Wales"" that the changes could happen. The Welsh Liberal Democrats described it as a ""cautious but welcome"" first step to reopening.

""It is so lovely just to be out in the open and in the sun again,"" said Ms Trollope. ""First drink of the year, we couldn't wait for it to open again, even if it is outside."" ""I wish I wore a t-shirt, instead of my winter jumper. We're celebrating in style,"" added Ms Cooper. Jean Ellis (far right) was relieved to be out after spending much of the past year at home Jean Ellis, from Rhyl, Denbighshire, was at the Dinorben Arms in Bodfari celebrating her son's birthday. ""It's lovely,"" she said. ""I was restricted to my own home for so long because I have heart problems and I have to be very careful, but I've had both my vaccinations now, so I'm hopefully clear now."" Nick Saunders, director of an entertainment and food venue in Cardiff, said he was ""delighted to be back open"" after being shut for the past five months. He said it was ""crucial"" to get more than 60 members of staff who have been on furlough back to work. Nick Saunders says the entertainment he can provide is still limited From Monday, the venue will be operating 40 tables offering street food, with table service carried out via an app. However, Mr Saunders said he was ""still limited"" by the entertainment he could offer, saying ""there's no real entertainment we can do apart from background music"". ""We'd be delighted to get back to entertaining people in the way that we have done previously,"" he said. Elen Morris reopened her pub in Bala on Monday Meanwhile, Elen Morris said there would be ""a lot to do"" to prepare for reopening her pub in Bala, Gwynedd, after five months of being shut. Ms Morris said opening outdoors would not be ""financially viable"" because there would be ""triple the staff, and a quarter of the capacity"", but once they could open indoors customers would be there ""day in, day out"". ""People used to go out and have a pint on their own and talk to bar staff until somebody else came in - and by the end of the night they would know who is who in the pub and all get along,"" she said. Locals headed to the beer garden to enjoy a pint and have a catch up in the sunshine in Ystalyfera Suzanne Hallmark-Powell, who was preparing for a busy day in her beer garden in Ystalyfera, near Swansea, told BBC Radio Wales that if the sunny weather continued everything would be OK. ""If it's like during the last lockdown when we reopened, all it did was rain for two weeks, and that put us even further back,"" she said. 'Can I host a music festival?' Could fans be back in Welsh stadiums this summer? She added she was looking forward to seeing her regulars again, saying: ""A lot of my regulars are elderly people that live on their own, so that walk to their pub or shop, that's their only socialisation."" Friends Vicky Evans and Lauren Ing enjoyed a cup of coffee in the sunshine at Barry Island As cafes and pubs could start serving customers outside, people enjoyed a drink in the sunshine at Barry Island. Friends Vicky Evans and Lauren Ing enjoyed a cup of coffee in the sunshine after travelling from Herefordshire, and said they might go for ""something stronger later"". After bringing his deck chair to the beach every day, to be able to sit outside, Jim Kennedy said it was ""wonderful"" to finally be able to meet friends for a drink. The sun was shining as people enjoyed pints at the Lamb and Flag in Rhayader, Powys Thomas Jones, who grabbed a pint at 11:00 BST when the Lamb and Flag in Rhayader reopened, said it had been ""a long winter"" for the industry. ""It's good to get out and support them,"" he said, ""We are hoping for a better summer in the town and looking forward to visitors."" People enjoyed soaking up the sunshine as the Liverpool Arms reopened in Conwy Meanwhile, in neighbouring county Conwy, Nick Jackson's zoo is also preparing to open its doors again to visitors. He said he was ""over the moon"" to reopen and staff had been working ""frantically"". ""We're so pleased to be opening and getting income back, but it still hangs over our heads the worry as to what the future holds."" Nick Jackson thinks many of his zoo's animals will enjoy the company of visitors again He said the zoo's closure to the public - including being shut for two Easter periods - has been ""very difficult, in a direct practical way because of the loss of income"". ""Although we're back on Monday we're not back to the level of normality we would like to see."" Fears lockdown dogs may be given up Goats roam in seaside town in lockdown The zoo will have a visitor number cap of 1,500 people who can enter per day. Mr Jackson said the site would only be able to reopen its outdoor areas, while its cafe is just operating for takeaways. However, he said he thought that many of the zoo's animals - including primates and monkeys - would ""enjoy the company of the visitors coming in"" because they find them entertaining and amusing. Adults will be able to take up watersports courses again - such as stand-up paddleboarding The lockdown changes also mean adults will also be able to return to outdoor activity centres. Alison Yates, operations and programme manager at a centre in Caernarfon, said the team was pleased visitors ""will now be able to experience the huge benefits that come from being out on the water, especially after a period which has been tough for many reasons, including on mental health"". Man's cold sea challenge 'to get out of bed' The attraction - which offers outdoor activities and watersports courses - initially reopened on 2 April for under-18s living in Wales, but from Monday it is able to welcome all visitors from across the UK. Alan Thompson had played bowls for 30 years but played his last game just a day before he had a stroke in 2018 For Alan Thompson, 74, the easing of restrictions means he will be able to step back on the bowling green for the first time in over three years after recovering from a stroke. While playing was banned, Mr Thompson, from Llantrisant, had been practicing by taking part in virtual games during lockdown. ""I honestly didn't think I'd ever be able to play bowls again, but playing virtual bowls helped me ease back into it and I've found my confidence again,"" he said. ""I've done the rehearsal and now it's time for the real performance out on the green."" Wedding receptions with 30 people can be held outdoors from Monday in Wales However, Bre Carrington-Sykes said despite restrictions easing to allow 30 at outdoor weddings, many of the bookings at her wedding venue still cannot go ahead. The venue in Llandyrnog, Denbighshire, typically accommodates up to 150 people for a wedding booking. The couple who stopped shielding to plan a wedding She said so far she just has two weddings able to go ahead in June, but there are at least 70 weddings still waiting to happen because couples want more than 30 people present. ""Until we open up properly, many of our weddings can't go ahead. ""On a wedding day, we could have roughly 40 staff - including caterers, florists - working here."" Bre Carrington-Sykes says just two of her wedding bookings can go ahead under the new rules ""Usually we'd have a wedding every weekend from March to the end of October. Last year we had 43 weddings booked. ""We're maintaining the place and desperate to get open, refurbishing different pieces, but an outdoor wedding even for 30 people - you can't guarantee the weather,"" she said. Tracey Owen, who owns a wedding venue, in Llangollen, Denbighshire, said three weeks notice was ""pretty pointless"" for most couples and many venues were already booked up. ""Weddings need a couple of months to prepare... and our couples are making decisions for weddings due to take place months away,"" she told BBC Radio Wales. She repeated calls for clarity for couples and the industry, saying people were ""desperate"" to know when receptions would be able to be held indoors. ""We've lost all of our weddings to postponements to later dates... our couples have been so patient we really need that clarity,"" she said. The Welsh government said it had provided the ""most generous offer of help anywhere in the UK"" with a package of financial assistance for firms worth more than Â£2bn. A spokeswoman said it was looking to run a number of pilot events in May and June, connected to the test events programme happening in England. ""We will assess these results and will work closely with the events sector with the aim of restoring activities safely and successfully in Wales as soon as we're able to do so,"" she said. Mr Drakeford, the Welsh Labour leader, said the reopening of hospitality outdoors would provide more opportunities for people to meet and have a ""significant positive impact on people's well-being"". A Welsh Conservative spokesman said the reopening of sectors such as outdoor hospitality was ""welcome but long overdue, particularly when clarity could've been afforded to these businesses some time ago"". ""Regrettably, Labour ministers have chosen to play politics at the expense of people's businesses and livelihoods, and that's why the Welsh Conservatives pledge to cut the confusion and end the political games in Cardiff Bay after May's Senedd election."" Adam Price, leader of Plaid Cymru, said it was ""thanks to the collective effort of the people of Wales"" and NHS staff that rules could be eased. ""Like people all over Wales, I can't wait to support local businesses by enjoying a socially distanced drink after a long day campaigning for Plaid Cymru."" Welsh Liberal Democrat leader Jane Dodds said the reopening was a ""cautious but welcome"" first step to the recovery of the hospitality sector, which it ""desperately needs"". ""For many firms, takings will be significantly down as they can only operate at a reduced capacity and it's important that financial assistance from the government continues,"" she said.

"Students were evacuated from the college as armed police continued to search the area Staff and students were evacuated from a college amid reports of shots being fired on the campus.

"Greek islands such as Mykonos are proving popular, says Thomas Cook People are increasingly putting off their summer holidays and booking autumn breaks instead due to uncertainty over international travel, tour operators say. Thomas Cook said autumn bookings were up 50% on normal levels, while luxury tour operator Kuoni said customers were ""holding out for October half term"". Greece and the Caribbean are among the most popular destinations. But some fear prices will rise due to fewer countries being open to tourism. International travel is due to resume from 17 May under the government's roadmap to reopening, with plans for a ""traffic-light"" system categorising different countries. However, the list of countries that Britons can travel to will not be known until nearer 17 May and will be subject to change. This has prompted a surge in autumn holiday bookings, with breaks in September and October accounting for 30% of Thomas Cook's live bookings for the year. That is up 50% on what the group normally sees in these months. A spokesman said there was a ""clear preference for September and October compared to what we normally expect"". He said many people had already booked domestic breaks for July and August and were looking for a ""week of sun in the Med"" later in the year. ""Devon is lovely, but Devon in October is not Devon in July,"" he added. Holiday bookings jump despite 'unclear rules' EasyJet sees summer holiday bookings surge 250% According to Thomas Cook, Greece is the most popular destination for autumn breaks, with Rhodes the most in-demand island followed by Crete, Santorini and Mykonos. The Canary Islands, a popular winter-sun destination, are the second most popular destination. Kuoni did not share booking figures but said the majority of 2021 sales have been from October onwards. It added that customers were ""saving and upgrading"" for long-haul winter sun breaks. Antigua is another popular destination ""We've chatted to lots of customers who have written off any hope of getting away in the summer but are holding out for October half-term,"" the company said. Its most popular destinations are the Maldives and the Caribbean, including Antigua, Barbados and Saint Lucia. Other travel firms are seeing evidence of the trend in searches on their websites. British Airways Holidays said there was a lot of ""pent-up demand"" for foreign holidays and it has seen a spike in searches for trips to long-haul beach destinations this autumn. Searches for December holidays have also seen a ""notable increase"", with New York proving popular. Meanwhile travel deals website Travelzoo predicts September and October will be ""big months for travel"". A survey of 2,000 of its members carried out last week found the majority said they plan to take a trip around that time. However, the company warned that prices could increase if demand continues and there is a limited number of destinations open for travel. ""Right now we are seeing some good prices for September and October, but there's every indication it will start to prove more challenging for [package-holiday customers],"" the company said. Under the government's proposed traffic-light system, counties will be categorised as red, amber or green depending their infection rates, vaccination coverage and the prevalence of variants of concern. Covid testing and quarantine requirements will vary from category to category. All passengers will have to take Covid tests before leaving and on returning - even from low-risk ""green"" countries. There will also be a green ""watchlist"" which will identify countries that are most at risk of moving from green to amber. Covid cases in some European countries remain high and vaccination programmes in the bloc have lagged behind the UK. The Association of Independent Tour Operators said: ""Would-be travellers are nervous without certainty. We need those government traffic lights to be confirmed to give us all confidence.""

"Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been sentenced to a further year in prison and a one-year travel ban after being found guilty of propaganda against the Iranian government. Her lawyer saidshe was accused of taking part in a protest in London 12 years agoand speaking to the BBC Persian service. The prime minister said the UK would ""redouble"" efforts to free her. The British-Iranian charity worker was first jailed in Tehran in 2016. She has always denied the spying charges levelled against her. Confirming the latest sentence, her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, said the court's decision was a bad sign and ""clearly a negotiating tactic"" by the Iranian authorities - who are in the middle of discussions over the country's nuclear activities. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe appears in Iran court Who is Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe? 'My wife has been used as a bargaining chip' Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe has not been taken to prison yet, her husband said, and plans to appeal against the sentence. ""The threat is there, and the threat is bigger than we were fearing."" Mr Ratcliffe told the BBC. Referring to the possibility of being separated from his wife until summer 2023, he said: ""I think the worst case got a bit closer."" Mr Ratcliffe has not seen his wife in person since her imprisonment in 2016. Their daughter, Gabriella, who was with her mother in Tehran when she was arrested, has been with him in the UK since 2019. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""I don't think it is right at all that Nazanin should be sentenced to any more time in jail."" He said it was ""wrong that she is there in the first place"" and pledged to work hard to secure her release so she could return to her family, ""just as we work for all our dual national cases in Iran"". ""The government will not stop, we will redouble our efforts, and we are working with our American friends on this issue as well,"" Mr Johnson said. Mr Ratcliffe maintains his wife was imprisoned as leverage for a debt owed by the UK over its failure to deliver tanks to Iran in 1979. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's daughter Gabriella, now six, had counted down the days to her mother's release He says the case may also be caught up in negotiations over the international agreement to limit Iran's enrichment of nuclear material, whichthe UK and others are trying to revive. The sentencing may mean that part of the Iranian regime is unhappy with the direction of the negotiations taking place in Vienna and is signalling that things can get worse for Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe andother jailed dual nationals, Mr Ratcliffe said Last year, Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was moved from prison due to the coronavirus crisis and held under house arrest in Tehran until March, when her ankle tag was removed. But she returned to court later that month to face the latest propaganda charges. by Caroline Hawley, BBC diplomatic correspondent The new sentence is a bitter blow to Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and her family, who have campaigned relentlessly to get her home for five years. Mr Ratcliffe says the sentence is worse than he'd expected - but that a guilty verdict was guaranteed. He has consistently said that she's being held as a hostage on trumped-up charges - and fears that she will only be freed if Iran gets something in exchange. In this, the Iranian regime certainly has form. Last November, it released the British-Australian academic Kylie Moore Gilbert, who'd been sentenced to 10 years for spying. That was in exchange for three Iranian prisoners in Thailand - two of whom had been convicted over a bomb plot. And back in early 2016, when Iran's nuclear agreement came into force, Iran freed an American journalist, Jason Rezaian, in a prisoner swap. It's no coincidence, Mr Ratcliffe believes, that this verdict has come just as negotiations are taking place to revive the deal. Labour MP Tulip Siddiq, who represents the family's north London constituency, said they had been ""hoping and praying"" she would soon be free but instead she was ""being abusively used as a bargaining chip"". Ms Siddiq said the UK government's behind-the-scenes efforts to secure her release had ""clearly failed"", saying, ""We deserve an urgent explanation from ministers about what has happened."" Former foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt said, ""Iran's cruelty seems to know no bounds,"" but he questioned why the UK had not simply settled the tank debt, given it accepted it owed the money. Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesperson Layla Moran called for the government to impose targeted sanctions against the officials responsible in Iran. A medical evaluation carried out for the human rights charity Redress recently foundMrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and obsessive stress disorder due to ""traumatising experiences in the prisons of Iran"" and the uncertainty about her fate. This video can not be played Richard Ratcliffe: ""I think it was worse than I was expecting"" She told doctors that, during solitary confinement at the beginning of her sentence in 2016, she was interrogated - often while blindfolded - for eight to nine hours a day. Redress director Rupert Skilbeck said a further sentence could cause ""irreparable damage to her health"" after the ""torture and ill-treatment"" she had already been subjected to. ""Nazanin has never received a fair trial in Iran and is innocent of the allegations made against her. Her detention has always been illegal under international law,"" he said. ""The case must be dismissed and she should be allowed to return to her husband and daughter in the UK immediately."" Amnesty International UK's director, Kate Allen, said Mrs Zagari-Ratcliffe had twice had to face a ""sham trial"" in Iran. ""We fear that going back to jail will be almost too much for Nazanin to bear,"" she said. UNCONVENTIONAL WAYS TO EARN A LIVING:Stream Young, Welsh and Bossin' It now OH!

"The US will share up to 60 million doses of its AstraZeneca vaccine with other countries as they become available, the White House has said. The doses will be able to be exported in the coming months after a federal safety review. The US has a stockpile of the vaccine even though its regulators have not yet authorised it for public use. Critics have accused the government of hoarding the vaccine, while other countries are in desperate need. India sets another Covid record as crisis deepens EU sues AstraZeneca over Covid vaccine delays Covid map: Where are cases the highest? Last month President Joe Biden pledged to share aboutfour million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine with Mexico and Canada- both of which have approved the jab. The crisis in Indiahas also piled pressure on the Biden administration to share US health resources. On Monday, the White House said it expected that about 10 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine could be released when the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) finishes its review in the coming weeks. It said that another 50 million doses were in various stages of production. At a news briefing, White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said FDA officials would carry out quality checks on doses before they were exported. ""Our team will share more details about our planning and who will be receiving offers from here, but we're in the planning process at this point in time,"" she added. The US has already announced that it will provide raw materials for Indian vaccine manufacturers as the country battles a devastating surge in cases. In a ""warm and positive"" phone call with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday, President Biden promised more emergency assistance ""including oxygen-related supplies, vaccine materials and therapeutics"", a White House statement said. Washington is also looking at supplying oxygen, Covid tests, personal protective equipment (PPE) and the antiviral drug remdesivir to India's health service. The FDA has so far authorised three vaccines against Covid- 19 - Pfizer BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson (Janssen). Experts say it looks likely that these will provide all the country's needs and the AstraZeneca jab may not be needed. According to the latest figures, more than 53% of adults have so far received at least one dose of vaccine. The US handling of the coronavirus pandemic has had plenty of shortcomings, but vaccine production isn't one of them. The Biden administration has an abundance of jabs, and now it is sharing some of that bounty with other countries. The decision to ship as many as 60 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine - which have yet to be approved for use in the US - comes at a critical moment, with US neighbours Canada and Mexico continuing to struggle and India facing a devastating surge in cases. It gives the Biden administration the opportunity to engage in ""vaccine diplomacy"" - using the shipments to pressure other nations to follow suit and engender goodwill that might help advance other US foreign policy priorities. At the very least it inoculates Joe Biden from criticism that the US has turned its back on the world as it sat on millions of doses that weren't needed - or wanted - when they could be saving lives. The domestic risk for the president seems minimal, as long as the US supply holds up. It signals the administration's growing confidence that the domestic challenge ahead isn't one of having enough jabs, but convincing all Americans to receive vaccinations that are already available.

"Ajay and Atul Gupta have been sanctioned, along with their brother Rajesh, accused of corruption in South Africa The UK has imposed sanctions on 22 individuals, 14 of them Russians, involved in notorious corruption cases under a new anti-corruption regime. Individuals across South Africa, South Sudan and Latin America were also targeted with the asset freezes and travel bans. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told MPs the UK had an important role to play in combating corruption. He also described the country as a ""honey pot"" for ""corrupt actors"". The new regime means individuals ""involved in some of the world's most serious cases of corruption"" will no longer be able to channel their money through UK banks or enter the country, a statement from the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office said. Sanctions were imposed on people from six countries, including: 14 Russians involved in a massive tax fraud uncovered by the lawyer,Sergei Magnitsky, who later died in custody Three businessmen - the brothers Ajay, Atul and Rajesh Gupta - accused of serious corruption in South Africa Sudanese businessman Ashraf Seed Ahmed Hussein Ali - dubbed Al Cardinal - accused of misappropriating state assets in South Sudan And three individuals accused of serious corruption in Honduras, Nicaragua and Guatemala This is the first time the UK has imposed sanctions for international corruption. Russian lawyer Sergei Magnitsky died in prison after revealing tax fraud Announcing the sanctions in the House of Commons, Mr Raab said: ""Corruption has an immensely corrosive effect on the rule of law, on trust in institutions, it slows development, it drains the wealth of poorer nations, it keeps their people trapped in poverty. It poisons the well of democracy around the world."" He added: ""Our status as a global financial centre makes us an attractive location for investment... but it also makes us a honey pot, a lightning rod for corrupt actors who seek to launder their dirty money through British banks or through British businesses."" Mr Raab said the new sanctions regime, taken partly in tandem with measures in the US, would provide ""an additional powerful tool to hold the corrupt to account"". Labour welcomed the announcement, but said law enforcement needed the resources to support investigations, describing the current rate of prosecutions for economic crime as ""woefully low"". Shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy said: ""If he's serious about what he's saying today he needs to put his money where his mouth is."" She also criticised a ""tangled network of financial interests and cosy relationships in the heart of government"". ""We need to know that this announcement isn't just a gloss on the surface of a grubby system which underneath signals business as usual,"" she said. Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken backed the new regime, as the country also introduced its own corruption sanctions. He said: ""Together, along with other allies and partners, we will seek to promote our shared values with similar tools. Corrupt actors, and their facilitators, will not have access to our financial systems."" More than 2% of global GDP is lost to corruption every year, and corruption increases the cost of doing business for individual companies by as much as 10%, according to government figures. ""Corruption also threatens our national security by exacerbating conflict and facilitating serious and organised crime, creating space for terrorist and criminal groups like Daesh and Boko Haram to operate,"" a Foreign Office statement said. It added: ""This new regime will allow the UK to combat serious corruption, in particular bribery and misappropriation. It will promote effective governance, robust democratic institutions and the rule of law - demonstrating our power as a force for good around the world.""

"Boris Johnson's former chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, has alleged that the prime minister once planned for Conservative donors to ""secretly pay"" for the revamp of the flat where he and fiancÃ©e Carrie Symonds live. But the defence secretary has responded by saying Mr Johnson ""personally"" footed the bill. What is the row over Boris Johnson's flat about? It's not clear whether any of the work - reportedly costing up to Â£200,000 - was initially paid for by another source, whom the prime minister then repaid. It was reported that Conservative Lord Brownlow said he was making a donation to the party, which included ""Â£58,000 to cover the payments"" already made. Asked whether he had ever discussed using donations to pay for refurbishments, Mr Johnson said: ""If there's anything to be said about that, any declaration to be made, that will of course be made in due course."" Why it matters:If Lord Brownlow, or other donors, contributed to the fund or made a loan, this should have been reported to the Electoral Commission, the body which ensures transparency in political funding. Details of the second lockdown were released before the government announced it on 31 October. Dominic Cummings has denied responsibility for those leaks. He also claimed the prime minister had considered stopping an inquiry into who was responsible for the leak after it was found that ""all the evidence"" pointed to Henry Newman - who was a Cabinet Office adviser at the time and now works in Downing Street. Carrie Symonds oversaw the redecoration of the flat she shares with the PM Mr Johnson allegedly said Mr Newman and Carrie Symonds were ""best friends"" and he would have to fire Mr Newman if the inquiry concluded that he was to blame - and that this could cause problems in his family life. The government said the PM had ""never interfered in a government leak inquiry"". And Cabinet Secretary Simon Case warned it was ""probable"" it would ""not successfully"" identify the person responsible, given the time that's elapsed. Why it matters:The inquiry still has not reported its findings, almost six months after being launched. If Mr Johnson wanted to stop it because it might conclude his fiancee's friend was the leaker, this would contravene the ministerial code, laying out rules of behaviour. Last week, messages sent between Mr Johnson and the businessman came to light. They revealed that, early in the pandemic, the prime minister had promised to ""fix"" a tax issue so that Sir James's Singapore-based staff could work for longer in the UK in order to help build more ventilators for sick patients. Johnson told Dyson he would 'fix' tax issue Mr Johnson promised to publish the full exchange on Friday, but while some details of the correspondence were released, this did not happen. Why it matters:The prime minister said there would be transparency over the texts and is therefore under pressure to give more information. Plans for a football competition in which six of the UK's clubs were guaranteed a place - whatever their Premier League performance - were announced last week. Mr Johnson was among its heaviest critics, calling it a ""cartel"". Edward Woodward came to Downing Street a few days before the European Super League was announced But it was later revealed that Manchester United chief executive Edward Woodward - whose club was one of those behind the European Super League (ESL) - had met the PM's chief of staff in Downing Street five days earlier. The Sunday Times reported that the plans had been discussed in the meeting. But Downing Street denied that, saying it had specifically been about the safe reopening of stadiums and what forms of Covid registration needed to be in place. Labour is pushing for fuller details of what happened in the meeting. Why it matters:The UK government welcomed the end of the ESL, from which the English clubs have withdrawn. But were some in Downing Street aware of the clubs' plan in advance? Mohammed bin Salman is accused of having authorised the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi It's been reported that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman contacted Mr Johnson to say relations between his country and the UK would be damaged if he did not try to ""correct"" the Premier League's decision not to allow a Â£300m takeover of Newcastle United. It is claimed the prime minister asked an aide, Lord Udny-Lister, to look into the matter. Government 'not involved' in Newcastle United sale But the government has denied any involvement with the takeover, a position backed up by Newcastle United. Why it matters:The Premier League had been scrutinising the takeover attempt over concerns that the consortium behind the bid was not properly independent from the Saudi government. Prince Mohammed is also accused of having approved themurder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggiat the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey, in 2018.

"The US will share up to 60 million doses of its AstraZeneca vaccine with other countries as they become available, the White House has said. The doses will be able to be exported in the coming months after a federal safety review. The US has a stockpile of the vaccine even though its regulators have not yet authorised it for public use. Critics have accused the government of hoarding the vaccine, while other countries are in desperate need. India sets another Covid record as crisis deepens EU sues AstraZeneca over Covid vaccine delays Covid map: Where are cases the highest? Last month President Joe Biden pledged to share aboutfour million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine with Mexico and Canada- both of which have approved the jab. The crisis in Indiahas also piled pressure on the Biden administration to share US health resources. On Monday, the White House said it expected that about 10 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine could be released when the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) finishes its review in the coming weeks. It said that another 50 million doses were in various stages of production. At a news briefing, White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said FDA officials would carry out quality checks on doses before they were exported. ""Our team will share more details about our planning and who will be receiving offers from here, but we're in the planning process at this point in time,"" she added. The US has already announced that it will provide raw materials for Indian vaccine manufacturers as the country battles a devastating surge in cases. In a ""warm and positive"" phone call with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday, President Biden promised more emergency assistance ""including oxygen-related supplies, vaccine materials and therapeutics"", a White House statement said. Washington is also looking at supplying oxygen, Covid tests, personal protective equipment (PPE) and the antiviral drug remdesivir to India's health service. The FDA has so far authorised three vaccines against Covid- 19 - Pfizer BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson (Janssen). Experts say it looks likely that these will provide all the country's needs and the AstraZeneca jab may not be needed. According to the latest figures, more than 53% of adults have so far received at least one dose of vaccine. The US handling of the coronavirus pandemic has had plenty of shortcomings, but vaccine production isn't one of them. The Biden administration has an abundance of jabs, and now it is sharing some of that bounty with other countries. The decision to ship as many as 60 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine - which have yet to be approved for use in the US - comes at a critical moment, with US neighbours Canada and Mexico continuing to struggle and India facing a devastating surge in cases. It gives the Biden administration the opportunity to engage in ""vaccine diplomacy"" - using the shipments to pressure other nations to follow suit and engender goodwill that might help advance other US foreign policy priorities. At the very least it inoculates Joe Biden from criticism that the US has turned its back on the world as it sat on millions of doses that weren't needed - or wanted - when they could be saving lives. The domestic risk for the president seems minimal, as long as the US supply holds up. It signals the administration's growing confidence that the domestic challenge ahead isn't one of having enough jabs, but convincing all Americans to receive vaccinations that are already available.

"Students were evacuated from the college as armed police continued to search the area Staff and students were evacuated from a college amid reports of shots being fired on the campus. An 18-year-old man was arrested and a knife and firearm recovered after armed police swooped on Crawley College. Unconfirmed reports suggest a staff member tackled the suspect. Video seen by the BBC appears to show a person being held on the ground by several others. Sussex Police said two staff members sustained minor injuries. No-one is thought to have been seriously hurt. Counter-terror police are working with local officers and ""all lines of inquiry are open,"" the force said. An 18-year-old student, who did not want to be named, said the ""frightening experience"" had left him feeling shaken up. ""It was quite hectic and it seemed liked something out of a game, like Call of Duty,"" he continued. ""Everyone was just shouting and screaming and bangs in the background, which some people assumed were gunshots."" Teachers told students to ""get under the table and shut the door, just as a precautionary measure,"" he said. They later left the college to a ""large police presence and police shouting and asking people to show their hands and evacuate the building in an orderly manner,"" he added. Video appearing to show a suspect being pinned to the ground has been shared by students on Snapchat. A student said he believed the footage showed a member of staff tackling the suspect before police ""swarmed the area"" and made an arrest. Police snipers were seen outside Crawley College Specialist counter-terror firearms officers were sent to the scene, alongside armed from Sussex and the Metropolitan Police. Officers searched a property about a mile from the college and helicopters patrolled the area. Ch Supt Howard Hodges said two members of college staff had ""suffered minor injuries and presented themselves to a walk-in medical centre"". The college said it would remain closed on Tuesday and further education provider Chichester College Group, said: ""Our priority remains the safety of students and staff."" Allow Twitter content?

"Senior minister Michael Gove is answering MPs' questions about allegations relating to Downing St controversies Mr Gove says he finds it 'incredible' that Boris Johnson is quoted as saying he would prefer bodies 'piling up in the streets' rather than order a third lockdown MPs are also raising lobbying, PM's flat refurbishment and the ministerial code Senior civil servant Cabinet Secretary Simon Case is also responding to MPs' questions He says he is conducting a review into whether private donations have been used to refurbish the PM's flat Labour has urged a ""full and transparent investigation"" into allegations about the renovations Mr Case says ""work is ongoing"" on the Downing St leak inquiry - but says the leaker might not be found Edited by Julian Joyce That's all for our live coverage on this story today. But before we go, a word from our political correspondent Helen Catt. She says there have been an awful lot of allegations made in recent days, but the most striking is that Boris Johnson suggested that ""bodies could pile high"" during a discussion about lockdown. She says Michael Gove put up ""a robust defence"" against criticism of this in the Commons. And on Simon Case's questioning over the leak inquiry, she says it was ""interesting"" he said that given the amount of time had gone he didn't think it would be probable that they would actually find the source.   Labour's Rachel Hopkins says the public deserve to know what the prime minister said to Manchester United chief executive Ed Woodward in a meeting before the failed European Super League was announced. She asks if Michael Gove will commit to publishing all details of the meeting. Gove says that his understanding was the conversation was about the more broad opening up of sporting events and said that the Boris Johnson and Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden were ""wholly opposed"" to the super league. SNP MP Hannah Bardell quotes figures saying 53% of people in Scotland think that the PM is corrupt. She says the PM is leading a government that is ""rotten to the core"" and asks Michael Gove if he will ensure a public inquiry happens and recognise that people in Scotland have a right to decide their own future. Gove says it's important to stress ""that on each of the detailed questions raised I explained the position and it is not as the SNP would wish it to be"". Labour's Wes Streeting says the delay in locking down the country ""led to a higher toll in both in terms of lives and livelihoods"". ""What I don't think anyone expected was to read on the front of the Daily Mail today the quote that the prime minister said 'let the bodies pile high in their thousands"","" he says. He asks if Michael Gove if he has ever heard the prime minister say these words and that the prime minister has never said those words. Gove says that he ""never heard the prime minister say any such thing"". ""We were all wrestling with an incredibly difficult decision, the decision to lockdown necessarily raises costs in other ways, as we are all aware, but the prime minister not only concluded at the end of discussion we had...that it was necessary to have a second lockdown but also sadly that it was to have a third lockdown as well,"" he says. Conservative MP for Calder Valley Craig Whittaker says that while these matters should be transparent ""one could only muse what other world leaders think of the UK prime minister having to pay for his own refurbishment"". ""The ridiculous situation is why the prime minister should be paying anything at all personally, unlike other world leaders, when it is us the tax payer who demands that they live above the shop,"" he says. Michael Gove says that Downing Street is a working building and there is some money which is allocated so that prime ministers who work in that building can perform their duties. SNP MP Stephen Flynn also cites reports that the prime minister suggested ""bodies could pile high"" during a heated discussion about lockdown in Downing Street in the autumn. He asks whether Michael Gove accepts that a ""prime minister that does not put public health first is no prime minister at all? Gove says he was in the meeting that afternoon. He adds: ""We are dealing with one of the most serious decisions this PM and any government has had to face. ""The prime minister made a decision in that meeting to trigger a second lockdown. He made a subsequent decision to trigger a third lockdown. ""This is a prime minister who was in hospital himself in intensive care. ""The idea that he would say any such thing I find incredible. Referring to Mr Flynn's allegations Mr Gove adds: ""By seeking to make the points in the way that he does diverts attention from the fact that so many people that have been affected by this pandemic rely on the government, the NHS and others to strain every sinew. ""These decisions are never easy. But the government and the PM made the decision to have a second and third lockdown and I think we can see the evidence of the leadership that he showed then. ""Not just in the courage that he showed but also in the success of the vaccination programme."" Green MP Caroline Lucas says concerns about the prime minister and the ministerial code are not ""tittle tattle"" - referring to comments by the International Trade Secretary Liz Truss at the weekend. She says: ""If, as seems to be the case with our archaic and dysfunctional rules, it is the prime minister himself who decides if the ministerial code has been broken, should we be trusting this one with marking his own homework or should the whole system be revised?"" Michael Gove says there is an opportunity with the appointment of a new independent adviser on ministerial interests to look again at how that role may be strengthened if deemed necessary. Liberal Democrat Vera Hobhouse asks if the minister agrees that the best way forward would be an independent public inquiry into the government's handling of the pandemic in ""order to get all the facts right"". Michael Gove agrees that we need a public inquiry but ""it is important that we concentrate now on the successful vaccine rollout, on the roadmap and the lifting of restrictions"". ""There will be a time for an independent public inquiry, and there will be lessons to be learnt, mistakes have been made,"" he says. Labour MP Dame Margaret Hodge also brings up the cost of refurbishing the prime minister's flat. She cites differing statements within the last week about the upfront cost of the refurbishment, and asks: ""How many more times will government ministers accept that their leader has misled the public, the press and Parliament before they declare him unfit for office?"" Michael Gove says he thinks that the specific allegation Dame Margaret makes against the PM is one she may wish to reflect on. He says ""the PM paid for the costs of renovation, declarations are properly made about political donations and the cabinet secretary pointed out that he is making sure that everything that was done was done in accordance with the rules"". Shadow Minister for the Cabinet Office Rachel Reeves is up next. She begins by quoting the PM's forward to the ministerial code, and says he is ""corrupting the standard of life expected in high office"". She asks:  On the Downing Street refurbishment, Michael Gove says that previous prime ministers have used tax-payers' money to repair the flat. He says: ""This prime minister has spent his own money on refurbishing Downing Street."" On dealing with the pandemic, Gove says the government has initiated three lockdowns in response to medical and scientific advice. Gove says it is right to say that we should appoint an independent adviser on ministerial interests as soon as possible. He says the appointment is due within days, and the adviser will have the freedom to carry out their role ""in exactly the way they should"". Replying to Ms Thewliss, Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove says that the government ""operating at a time when the pandemic was raging"" did everything it could to make sure those on the front line got the equipment they needed. He says that Ms Thewliss repeated the line on ""bodies in the street"" from a newspaper but did not mention that the prime minister did introduce a third lockdown. ""What she doesn't acknowledge is the determined effort by public servants into his government and others to deal with the pandemic and save lives, instead she tries to score political points,"" he says. In the Commons main chamber the SNP's Alison Thewliss begins the urgent question by saying that Prime Minister Boris Johnson's alleged comments that he would rather see ""bodies pile up in the streets"" then introduce another lockdown are ""despicable, cruel and callous"" and says they are not befitting of the office of prime minister. She says that government contracts have been handed to those with known political connections and says that ""we need to know who has benefited and what their links are to ministers"". ""Will ministers stop hiding behind commercial confidentiality and publish full details of these VIP contracts along with who recommended them?"" she says, adding that it is ""our money"". She says in absence of an independent adviser on standards ""we can no longer trust them to investigate themselves"" and calls for a full independent public inquiry. Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent The bonnet is up and we're having a good old peer in. The inner workings of government - how it works, rather than to what end - is most often the preserve of the insufferably nerdy. I plead guilty. But the last few days act as an illustration of why this stuff matters. It is about what happens when those on the inside might assume no one is looking - and how good the rules are to regulate this behaviour. This afternoon we've heard from two of Westminster's most senior figures as far as all this is concerned. Two figures we rarely hear from in public: Simon Case, the country's top civil servant, and Darren Tierney, who is in charge of ""Propriety and Ethics"" at the Cabinet Office. If Mr Case did the same amount of physical stonewalling as he has rhetorical stonewalling in the last few hours, he'd have biceps like Popeye's. He's said - ad nauseam - that there's a limit to what he can say because of ongoing internal investigations. But bit by bit, inch by inch, new nuggets are emerging about what on earth has been going on.  Just before we  leave the committee hearing there have been more details on Mr Greensill's role in government. Darren Tierney says that while hisn team have not been able to find any contract there is ""some evidence that his appointment was signed off by the then-minister of the cabinet office and the then secretary of the cabinet office"". That would have been Francis Maude and Ian Watmore, he says. David Jones says he finds it ""rather alarming"" that Simon Case and Tierney come before the committee ""not knowing anything about the terms upon which Mr Greensill managed to be installed in Downing Street"". Case agrees that he finds it alarming as well. The cabinet secretary says that this is the purpose of the inquiry led by Nigel Boardman. We move now to the main chamber in the House of Commons. Michael Gove is now answering an urgent question on ministerial code from SNP MP Alison Thewliss in the House of Commons. Now on to questions about Greensill.You can read more on that here. Links between former Prime Minister David Cameron, the government and the finance company, Greensill Capital, have come under scrutiny from MPs and official bodies. Mr Cameron has been criticised for lobbying ministers on behalf of the company, in which he had a commercial interest. It's also been revealedhe contacted Treasury officials and the Bank of Englandin an attempt to gain Greensill access to a Covid loan scheme. David Jones asks: ""Was Lex Greensill employed as a special adviser at Downing Street?"" Simon Case replies: ""He wasn't employed as a special adviser."" Jones presses further on the nature of Greensill's role. David Tierney replies that his exact status is ""unclear"". He says: ""He was appointed as an unpaid adviser on supply chain finance in January 2012. He did that until 2015. ""In 2013 he also became a crime representative which lasted until 2016 when he left the Cabinet Office. ""His status as an adviser it's unclear what basis that has, that's something that we've asked Nigel Boardman to specifically look into. ""We've been unable to find a contract. What we've found so far are an appointment letter and then subsequent reappointment letters which set out some conditions on his appointment... 

So far we've been unable to identify a contract.""  Asked what there is to stop the prime minister being lobbied or blackmailed over a personal mobile phone, Simon Case says there are security packages ""around all the communications that ministers have by whatever means"". ""The level of security is increasing all the time,"" he says. Government-issued IT is generally more secure, he adds, with highly-classified material ""very secure"". Case says he thinks the idea of problems coming from ministers having personal phones is a ""bit of a red herring"". ""If it is government business then it is government business and needs to be declared and set out in the same way,"" he says. ""It is the means of technology which is changing rather than the fundamentals of needing to record government procedure."" John McDonnell asks Darren Tierney about how proactive the Cabinet Office's propriety and ethics team are in scenarios such as the chancellor's texts being published. Tierney says the team ""does not just wait for things to come to us"". He adds: ""The ministerial code is clear that it is for ministers to satisfy themselves that they are following the code, it's not for the Cabinet Secretary or I to police the code. ""That said we don't just sit there and let things go by, we will get involved in specific cases as necessary or at the advice of the PM. McDonnell asks Darren Tierney if he provided advice on any of the examples given. Tierney says: ""I don't think I want to get into individual cases. ""I don't think I want to comment on any ongoing case work that the team are doing. ""We're engaged on a range of issues that are live at the moment."" SNP MP Ronnie Cowan asks about what the impact has been of the resignation of the prime minister's independent adviser on the ministerial code five months ago. Sir Alex Allanquit after Boris Johnson backed Priti Patel over bullying claimsand has not yet been replaced. Simon Case says it is an important role but in his experience ""it has not had a particularly significant impact"" but said the prime minister was clear he needed to get a new adviser in post as soon as possible. Cowan then asks if the ""Greensill affair"" would have been different with an adviser in post. Case says the majority of issues to do with Greensill ""have related to former government ministers"" which would not have related to the independent adviser. He adds that he hopes a replacement will be appointed in ""days rather than weeks"" but says not to hold him to that. Tory MP David Jones asks about the cost of refurbishing the prime minister's flat, and whether it will be paid for through private donations. Simon Case says any costs beyond the annual Â£30,000 allowance ""are met by the prime minister privately"". On the use of a trust to pay for costs, Case says ""there's work been going on on this for 12 months"". He says that Chequers and other buildings are supported by trusts but that no trust for Downing Street ""currently exists"". He adds: ""Work was begun last spring and Lord Brownlow agreed to be chair of a putative trust. There was work done to identify cross-party potential trustees. ""On the trust itself, when I became aware of this earlier this year... we've been looking at this question in much more detail of how a trust could work, building on the models from elsewhere.

"Senior minister Michael Gove is answering MPs' questions about allegations relating to Downing St controversies Mr Gove says he finds it 'incredible' that Boris Johnson is quoted as saying he would prefer bodies 'piling up in the streets' rather than order a third lockdown MPs are also raising lobbying, PM's flat refurbishment and the ministerial code Senior civil servant Cabinet Secretary Simon Case is also responding to MPs' questions He says he is conducting a review into whether private donations have been used to refurbish the PM's flat Labour has urged a ""full and transparent investigation"" into allegations about the renovations Mr Case says ""work is ongoing"" on the Downing St leak inquiry - but says the leaker might not be found Edited by Julian Joyce That's all for our live coverage on this story today. But before we go, a word from our political correspondent Helen Catt. She says there have been an awful lot of allegations made in recent days, but the most striking is that Boris Johnson suggested that ""bodies could pile high"" during a discussion about lockdown. She says Michael Gove put up ""a robust defence"" against criticism of this in the Commons. And on Simon Case's questioning over the leak inquiry, she says it was ""interesting"" he said that given the amount of time had gone he didn't think it would be probable that they would actually find the source.   Labour's Rachel Hopkins says the public deserve to know what the prime minister said to Manchester United chief executive Ed Woodward in a meeting before the failed European Super League was announced. She asks if Michael Gove will commit to publishing all details of the meeting. Gove says that his understanding was the conversation was about the more broad opening up of sporting events and said that the Boris Johnson and Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden were ""wholly opposed"" to the super league. SNP MP Hannah Bardell quotes figures saying 53% of people in Scotland think that the PM is corrupt. She says the PM is leading a government that is ""rotten to the core"" and asks Michael Gove if he will ensure a public inquiry happens and recognise that people in Scotland have a right to decide their own future. Gove says it's important to stress ""that on each of the detailed questions raised I explained the position and it is not as the SNP would wish it to be"". Labour's Wes Streeting says the delay in locking down the country ""led to a higher toll in both in terms of lives and livelihoods"". ""What I don't think anyone expected was to read on the front of the Daily Mail today the quote that the prime minister said 'let the bodies pile high in their thousands"","" he says. He asks if Michael Gove if he has ever heard the prime minister say these words and that the prime minister has never said those words. Gove says that he ""never heard the prime minister say any such thing"". ""We were all wrestling with an incredibly difficult decision, the decision to lockdown necessarily raises costs in other ways, as we are all aware, but the prime minister not only concluded at the end of discussion we had...that it was necessary to have a second lockdown but also sadly that it was to have a third lockdown as well,"" he says. Conservative MP for Calder Valley Craig Whittaker says that while these matters should be transparent ""one could only muse what other world leaders think of the UK prime minister having to pay for his own refurbishment"". ""The ridiculous situation is why the prime minister should be paying anything at all personally, unlike other world leaders, when it is us the tax payer who demands that they live above the shop,"" he says. Michael Gove says that Downing Street is a working building and there is some money which is allocated so that prime ministers who work in that building can perform their duties. SNP MP Stephen Flynn also cites reports that the prime minister suggested ""bodies could pile high"" during a heated discussion about lockdown in Downing Street in the autumn. He asks whether Michael Gove accepts that a ""prime minister that does not put public health first is no prime minister at all? Gove says he was in the meeting that afternoon. He adds: ""We are dealing with one of the most serious decisions this PM and any government has had to face. ""The prime minister made a decision in that meeting to trigger a second lockdown. He made a subsequent decision to trigger a third lockdown. ""This is a prime minister who was in hospital himself in intensive care. ""The idea that he would say any such thing I find incredible. Referring to Mr Flynn's allegations Mr Gove adds: ""By seeking to make the points in the way that he does diverts attention from the fact that so many people that have been affected by this pandemic rely on the government, the NHS and others to strain every sinew. ""These decisions are never easy. But the government and the PM made the decision to have a second and third lockdown and I think we can see the evidence of the leadership that he showed then. ""Not just in the courage that he showed but also in the success of the vaccination programme."" Green MP Caroline Lucas says concerns about the prime minister and the ministerial code are not ""tittle tattle"" - referring to comments by the International Trade Secretary Liz Truss at the weekend. She says: ""If, as seems to be the case with our archaic and dysfunctional rules, it is the prime minister himself who decides if the ministerial code has been broken, should we be trusting this one with marking his own homework or should the whole system be revised?"" Michael Gove says there is an opportunity with the appointment of a new independent adviser on ministerial interests to look again at how that role may be strengthened if deemed necessary. Liberal Democrat Vera Hobhouse asks if the minister agrees that the best way forward would be an independent public inquiry into the government's handling of the pandemic in ""order to get all the facts right"". Michael Gove agrees that we need a public inquiry but ""it is important that we concentrate now on the successful vaccine rollout, on the roadmap and the lifting of restrictions"". ""There will be a time for an independent public inquiry, and there will be lessons to be learnt, mistakes have been made,"" he says. Labour MP Dame Margaret Hodge also brings up the cost of refurbishing the prime minister's flat. She cites differing statements within the last week about the upfront cost of the refurbishment, and asks: ""How many more times will government ministers accept that their leader has misled the public, the press and Parliament before they declare him unfit for office?"" Michael Gove says he thinks that the specific allegation Dame Margaret makes against the PM is one she may wish to reflect on. He says ""the PM paid for the costs of renovation, declarations are properly made about political donations and the cabinet secretary pointed out that he is making sure that everything that was done was done in accordance with the rules"". Shadow Minister for the Cabinet Office Rachel Reeves is up next. She begins by quoting the PM's forward to the ministerial code, and says he is ""corrupting the standard of life expected in high office"". She asks:  On the Downing Street refurbishment, Michael Gove says that previous prime ministers have used tax-payers' money to repair the flat. He says: ""This prime minister has spent his own money on refurbishing Downing Street."" On dealing with the pandemic, Gove says the government has initiated three lockdowns in response to medical and scientific advice. Gove says it is right to say that we should appoint an independent adviser on ministerial interests as soon as possible. He says the appointment is due within days, and the adviser will have the freedom to carry out their role ""in exactly the way they should"". Replying to Ms Thewliss, Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove says that the government ""operating at a time when the pandemic was raging"" did everything it could to make sure those on the front line got the equipment they needed. He says that Ms Thewliss repeated the line on ""bodies in the street"" from a newspaper but did not mention that the prime minister did introduce a third lockdown. ""What she doesn't acknowledge is the determined effort by public servants into his government and others to deal with the pandemic and save lives, instead she tries to score political points,"" he says. In the Commons main chamber the SNP's Alison Thewliss begins the urgent question by saying that Prime Minister Boris Johnson's alleged comments that he would rather see ""bodies pile up in the streets"" then introduce another lockdown are ""despicable, cruel and callous"" and says they are not befitting of the office of prime minister. She says that government contracts have been handed to those with known political connections and says that ""we need to know who has benefited and what their links are to ministers"". ""Will ministers stop hiding behind commercial confidentiality and publish full details of these VIP contracts along with who recommended them?"" she says, adding that it is ""our money"". She says in absence of an independent adviser on standards ""we can no longer trust them to investigate themselves"" and calls for a full independent public inquiry. Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent The bonnet is up and we're having a good old peer in. The inner workings of government - how it works, rather than to what end - is most often the preserve of the insufferably nerdy. I plead guilty. But the last few days act as an illustration of why this stuff matters. It is about what happens when those on the inside might assume no one is looking - and how good the rules are to regulate this behaviour. This afternoon we've heard from two of Westminster's most senior figures as far as all this is concerned. Two figures we rarely hear from in public: Simon Case, the country's top civil servant, and Darren Tierney, who is in charge of ""Propriety and Ethics"" at the Cabinet Office. If Mr Case did the same amount of physical stonewalling as he has rhetorical stonewalling in the last few hours, he'd have biceps like Popeye's. He's said - ad nauseam - that there's a limit to what he can say because of ongoing internal investigations. But bit by bit, inch by inch, new nuggets are emerging about what on earth has been going on.  Just before we  leave the committee hearing there have been more details on Mr Greensill's role in government. Darren Tierney says that while hisn team have not been able to find any contract there is ""some evidence that his appointment was signed off by the then-minister of the cabinet office and the then secretary of the cabinet office"". That would have been Francis Maude and Ian Watmore, he says. David Jones says he finds it ""rather alarming"" that Simon Case and Tierney come before the committee ""not knowing anything about the terms upon which Mr Greensill managed to be installed in Downing Street"". Case agrees that he finds it alarming as well. The cabinet secretary says that this is the purpose of the inquiry led by Nigel Boardman. We move now to the main chamber in the House of Commons. Michael Gove is now answering an urgent question on ministerial code from SNP MP Alison Thewliss in the House of Commons. Now on to questions about Greensill.You can read more on that here. Links between former Prime Minister David Cameron, the government and the finance company, Greensill Capital, have come under scrutiny from MPs and official bodies. Mr Cameron has been criticised for lobbying ministers on behalf of the company, in which he had a commercial interest. It's also been revealedhe contacted Treasury officials and the Bank of Englandin an attempt to gain Greensill access to a Covid loan scheme. David Jones asks: ""Was Lex Greensill employed as a special adviser at Downing Street?"" Simon Case replies: ""He wasn't employed as a special adviser."" Jones presses further on the nature of Greensill's role. David Tierney replies that his exact status is ""unclear"". He says: ""He was appointed as an unpaid adviser on supply chain finance in January 2012. He did that until 2015. ""In 2013 he also became a crime representative which lasted until 2016 when he left the Cabinet Office. ""His status as an adviser it's unclear what basis that has, that's something that we've asked Nigel Boardman to specifically look into. ""We've been unable to find a contract. What we've found so far are an appointment letter and then subsequent reappointment letters which set out some conditions on his appointment... 

So far we've been unable to identify a contract.""  Asked what there is to stop the prime minister being lobbied or blackmailed over a personal mobile phone, Simon Case says there are security packages ""around all the communications that ministers have by whatever means"". ""The level of security is increasing all the time,"" he says. Government-issued IT is generally more secure, he adds, with highly-classified material ""very secure"". Case says he thinks the idea of problems coming from ministers having personal phones is a ""bit of a red herring"". ""If it is government business then it is government business and needs to be declared and set out in the same way,"" he says. ""It is the means of technology which is changing rather than the fundamentals of needing to record government procedure."" John McDonnell asks Darren Tierney about how proactive the Cabinet Office's propriety and ethics team are in scenarios such as the chancellor's texts being published. Tierney says the team ""does not just wait for things to come to us"". He adds: ""The ministerial code is clear that it is for ministers to satisfy themselves that they are following the code, it's not for the Cabinet Secretary or I to police the code. ""That said we don't just sit there and let things go by, we will get involved in specific cases as necessary or at the advice of the PM. McDonnell asks Darren Tierney if he provided advice on any of the examples given. Tierney says: ""I don't think I want to get into individual cases. ""I don't think I want to comment on any ongoing case work that the team are doing. ""We're engaged on a range of issues that are live at the moment."" SNP MP Ronnie Cowan asks about what the impact has been of the resignation of the prime minister's independent adviser on the ministerial code five months ago. Sir Alex Allanquit after Boris Johnson backed Priti Patel over bullying claimsand has not yet been replaced. Simon Case says it is an important role but in his experience ""it has not had a particularly significant impact"" but said the prime minister was clear he needed to get a new adviser in post as soon as possible. Cowan then asks if the ""Greensill affair"" would have been different with an adviser in post. Case says the majority of issues to do with Greensill ""have related to former government ministers"" which would not have related to the independent adviser. He adds that he hopes a replacement will be appointed in ""days rather than weeks"" but says not to hold him to that. Tory MP David Jones asks about the cost of refurbishing the prime minister's flat, and whether it will be paid for through private donations. Simon Case says any costs beyond the annual Â£30,000 allowance ""are met by the prime minister privately"". On the use of a trust to pay for costs, Case says ""there's work been going on on this for 12 months"". He says that Chequers and other buildings are supported by trusts but that no trust for Downing Street ""currently exists"". He adds: ""Work was begun last spring and Lord Brownlow agreed to be chair of a putative trust. There was work done to identify cross-party potential trustees. ""On the trust itself, when I became aware of this earlier this year... we've been looking at this question in much more detail of how a trust could work, building on the models from elsewhere. ""This is a genuinely complicated legal policy proprietary issue. ""A charitable trust can't cover private areas of Downing Street, so it's clear that that can't be done."" Asked whether he is aware of any private donations made to fund the refurbishment of the PM's flat, Case says: ""The prime minister has asked me to conduct a review because I've not been involved directly in this.""

"Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been sentenced to a further year in prison and a one-year travel ban after being found guilty of propaganda against the Iranian government. Her lawyer saidshe was accused of taking part in a protest in London 12 years agoand speaking to the BBC Persian service. The prime minister said the UK would ""redouble"" efforts to free her. The British-Iranian charity worker was first jailed in Tehran in 2016. She has always denied the spying charges levelled against her. Confirming the latest sentence, her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, said the court's decision was a bad sign and ""clearly a negotiating tactic"" by the Iranian authorities - who are in the middle of discussions over the country's nuclear activities. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe appears in Iran court Who is Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe? 'My wife has been used as a bargaining chip' Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe has not been taken to prison yet, her husband said, and plans to appeal against the sentence. ""The threat is there, and the threat is bigger than we were fearing."" Mr Ratcliffe told the BBC. Referring to the possibility of being separated from his wife until summer 2023, he said: ""I think the worst case got a bit closer."" Mr Ratcliffe has not seen his wife in person since her imprisonment in 2016. Their daughter, Gabriella, who was with her mother in Tehran when she was arrested, has been with him in the UK since 2019. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""I don't think it is right at all that Nazanin should be sentenced to any more time in jail."" He said it was ""wrong that she is there in the first place"" and pledged to work hard to secure her release so she could return to her family, ""just as we work for all our dual national cases in Iran"". ""The government will not stop, we will redouble our efforts, and we are working with our American friends on this issue as well,"" Mr Johnson said. Mr Ratcliffe maintains his wife was imprisoned as leverage for a debt owed by the UK over its failure to deliver tanks to Iran in 1979. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's daughter Gabriella, now six, had counted down the days to her mother's release He says the case may also be caught up in negotiations over the international agreement to limit Iran's enrichment of nuclear material, whichthe UK and others are trying to revive. The sentencing may mean that part of the Iranian regime is unhappy with the direction of the negotiations taking place in Vienna and is signalling that things can get worse for Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe andother jailed dual nationals, Mr Ratcliffe said Last year, Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was moved from prison due to the coronavirus crisis and held under house arrest in Tehran until March, when her ankle tag was removed. But she returned to court later that month to face the latest propaganda charges. by Caroline Hawley, BBC diplomatic correspondent The new sentence is a bitter blow to Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and her family, who have campaigned relentlessly to get her home for five years. Mr Ratcliffe says the sentence is worse than he'd expected - but that a guilty verdict was guaranteed. He has consistently said that she's being held as a hostage on trumped-up charges - and fears that she will only be freed if Iran gets something in exchange. In this, the Iranian regime certainly has form. Last November, it released the British-Australian academic Kylie Moore Gilbert, who'd been sentenced to 10 years for spying. That was in exchange for three Iranian prisoners in Thailand - two of whom had been convicted over a bomb plot. And back in early 2016, when Iran's nuclear agreement came into force, Iran freed an American journalist, Jason Rezaian, in a prisoner swap. It's no coincidence, Mr Ratcliffe believes, that this verdict has come just as negotiations are taking place to revive the deal. Labour MP Tulip Siddiq, who represents the family's north London constituency, said they had been ""hoping and praying"" she would soon be free but instead she was ""being abusively used as a bargaining chip"". Ms Siddiq said the UK government's behind-the-scenes efforts to secure her release had ""clearly failed"", saying, ""We deserve an urgent explanation from ministers about what has happened."" Former foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt said, ""Iran's cruelty seems to know no bounds,"" but he questioned why the UK had not simply settled the tank debt, given it accepted it owed the money. Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesperson Layla Moran called for the government to impose targeted sanctions against the officials responsible in Iran. A medical evaluation carried out for the human rights charity Redress recently foundMrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and obsessive stress disorder due to ""traumatising experiences in the prisons of Iran"" and the uncertainty about her fate. This video can not be played Richard Ratcliffe: ""I think it was worse than I was expecting"" She told doctors that, during solitary confinement at the beginning of her sentence in 2016, she was interrogated - often while blindfolded - for eight to nine hours a day. Redress director Rupert Skilbeck said a further sentence could cause ""irreparable damage to her health"" after the ""torture and ill-treatment"" she had already been subjected to. ""Nazanin has never received a fair trial in Iran and is innocent of the allegations made against her. Her detention has always been illegal under international law,"" he said. ""The case must be dismissed and she should be allowed to return to her husband and daughter in the UK immediately."" Amnesty International UK's director, Kate Allen, said Mrs Zagari-Ratcliffe had twice had to face a ""sham trial"" in Iran. ""We fear that going back to jail will be almost too much for Nazanin to bear,"" she said. UNCONVENTIONAL WAYS TO EARN A LIVING:Stream Young, Welsh and Bossin' It now OH!

"Boris Johnson lives in Downing Street with his fiancee Carrie Symonds The UK's top civil servant says Boris Johnson has asked him to review how the refurbishment of his Downing Street flat was paid for. Cabinet Secretary Simon Case was responding to MPs' questions about how the work was funded. The row escalated after Mr Johnson's ex-adviser Dominic Cummings claimed the PM once planned to have donors ""secretly pay"" for the revamp. The PM has said any relevant donations will be declared ""in due course"". Labour has called on the Electoral Commission, which regulates political donations in the UK, to launch a formal investigation. The watchdog has said it is talking to the Conservative Party about whether the spending on the flat falls within its remit. PM's flat refurbishment: What is the row about? Johnson's 'bodies pile high' comments prompt criticism Five questions for the PM and why the answers matter Appearing before a Commons committeeon Monday, Mr Case said a review into the refurbishment would look at ""how this has been done"". Asked repeatedly whether he was aware if private donations covered any of the costs, he said he had ""not been involved directly in this"". ""I do not have all of the facts and details at my disposal,"" he said, adding that his review would probably take ""a matter of weeks"". Another day, another denial.  Another 24 hours when rather than making their arguments, the government is embroiled in arguments about the past. Whether it's the prime minister's alleged frustrations about lockdown, attacks from his former adviser Dominic Cummings, or the mystery over his expensive flat renovation, as one senior Tory put it, it matters, because it all relates to Boris Johnson's judgement. Many Conservatives have been confident however that the prime minister's reputation, his enjoyment for pushing convention, is something that many voters are even attracted to. But there's a risk that confidence could turn to complacency. There is a belief in the Labour Party that the unhappy mess is starting to be noticed by voters. And no one knows when, or what might next emerge. One cabinet minister told me ""there's nothing we can do to control it."" The claims about the flat are contained in a blog posted by Mr Cummings on Friday, his first since leaving his role in No 10. In the blog, Mr Cummingsalso deniedhe was behind the leaking of details of November's second coronavirus lockdown in England. Mr Case told MPs that an internal inquiry into that leak was ongoing, but it was ""probable"" officials working on it would fail to identify any sources. Meanwhile, Mr Johnson has denied reports he said he would rather ""let the bodies pile high in their thousands"" than order a third lockdown. TheDaily Mail reported,externalthe prime minister made the remarks during heated conversations within government in the autumn over lockdown restrictions. Sources familiar with the conversationhave told the BBCMr Johnson suggested he would rather see ""bodies pile high"" during the discussions. This video can not be played Simon Case was asked whether private donations funded work at the flat Like several of his recent predecessors, the PM is living in the flat above No 11 Downing Street, which is larger than the one above No 10. Speaking earlier, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said the prime minister had paid for the revamp ""from his own money"" . He said this came ""on top of"" public money from the annual Â£30,000 taxpayer grant available to all prime ministers for the upkeep of their accommodation. In awritten statement on Friday,external, the government said no money from this grant was spent in the 2019/20 financial year. Figures for this year are expected to be published in the summer. ""At all times the prime minister has complied with the rules. He's paid for it out of his own money, "" he said. Michelle Obama visited Samantha Cameron in the 11 Downing St flat back in 2011 Speaking to reporters on Monday, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer urged a ""full and transparent investigation"" into the allegations about the Downing Street flat, arguing they risked undermining trust in government. ""It's all very well the prime minister saying now 'I paid for it', the critical question was: what was the original arrangement - and why is it so complicated?"" ""If there's a straightforward answer, well give it. And if there isn't, then there are very serious questions to be asked,"" he added. A No 10 spokesperson said: ""At all times, the government and ministers have acted in accordance with the appropriate codes of conduct and electoral law."" Donations and loans to political parties of more than Â£7,500 must be reported to the Electoral Commission. The Conservative Party has previously said that all ""reportable donations"" are ""correctly declared to the Electoral Commission, published by them and comply fully with the law"". The party said ""gifts and benefits received in a ministerial capacity"" are declared in government transparency returns. Mr Case was also asked by MPs about the case of businessman Lex Greensill who was a part-time unpaid government adviser in David Cameron's government. The civil servant boss said that situation was not ""acceptable"" and that it ""looks like there were conflicts"". He added that he didn't think there was anything of that equivalent happening in the civil service now. The prime minister has already appointed the lawyer Nigel Boardman to hold a review into all the issues surrounding Greensill Capital. What is the David Cameron lobbying row about?

"This video can not be played Pubs and restaurants reopen for the first time in four months Shops, gyms, swimming pools, pubs, restaurants and cafes in Scotland have reopened after a four month-long winter lockdown. Early morning queues formed at fashion retailers in Glasgow and Edinburgh as shoppers waited for doors opening. Travel restrictions have also been eased, allowing trips to other parts of the UK for non-essential reasons. Ministers say restrictions can be eased as the most vulnerable people have been offered their first vaccine dose. Scotland has been in level four lockdown since 26 December, with all non-essential shops, leisure facilities, and hospitality venues closed. New draft hospitality Covid guidance a 'bombshell' How many people are not taking the Covid vaccine? Driving lessons and tests can resume, while nail salons, museums and holiday accommodation can also reopen. As the mainland moves into level three restrictions many businesses will still be subject to strict rules on capacity and social distancing. Unlike England, pubs and restaurants will be able open indoors until 20:00 - but they will only be able to serve alcohol to customers seated outside. Queues formed on Glasgow's Argyle Street early on Monday ahead of the shops reopening A number of shops across Scotland opened early to mark the easing of restrictions with queues outside many larger retailers. Braehead Shopping Centre near Glasgow opened at 07:00, with some customers outside for an hour beforehand. Katie Moody, of the city's Princes Square shopping centre, said: ""People do seem a bit more comfortable about coming out this time. ""Glaswegians love to shop, we have seen queues in the city and I think there are just some things you want to experience in person and we are giving them that back."" In Inverness, restaurateur Norman MacDonald MBE opened his Cafe 1 restaurant for the first time since Christmas Eve. He said: ""It is great we are open, and the team is back in and champing at the bit to look after their customers."" Lush on Edinburgh's Princes Street had a small queue waiting. Manager Alan Brown said: ""We're just really excited to be speaking to people again after such a long time."" Liz Cameron from the Scottish Chamber of Commerce said the excitement was ""fantastic"" for businesses. She added: ""We must remember it's been a long time, and we have a lot of costs we have to be able to recoup and it will not happen in a day or a week. ""It's the start of our journey but let's remember this is about trying to save as many jobs as possible. "" Friends enjoyed the chance to meet up over a pint outside the Three Sisters in Edinburgh Small groups of people, some with blankets over their laps, gathered for post-work drinks on Edinburgh's George Street Early pub customers enjoy an outside drink in Glasgow city centre Public Health expert Prof Devi Sridhar said infection numbers were low enough to support the opening up of a large part of society. She told BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotland: ""The end is in sight within weeks. We can see the full adult population getting vaccines by the summer."" She said Covid testing would also make a difference. ""I would really encourage people to get tested both the PCR and at home lateral flow testing,"" she added. ""The safest way to keep bars and pubs and indoor hospitality open is to make sure that nobody inside is infectious."" Up to six people from two households can socialise indoors in a public place such as a cafÃ© or restaurant Unrestricted travel within Scotland, England and Wales (subject to other local restrictions in place) All shops and close contact services (like nail salons and tattoo parlours) can open Hospitality venues like cafes, pubs and restaurants can open until 20:00 indoors (no alcohol) They can serve alcohol outdoors according to local licensing laws Non-essential childcare permitted Non-essential in-house work (like painter and decorators) permitted Tourist accommodation to reopen (self-catering accommodation to be restricted in line with rules on indoor gathering) Driving lessons and tests can take place Funerals and weddings including wakes and receptions can take place with up to 50 people (alcohol permitted) Gyms and swimming pools can reopen for individual exercise Indoor attractions and public buildings such as galleries, museums and libraries can open Takeaway food can be collected indoors Rapid testing kits are being madeavailable to everyone in the country.The lateral flow tests can be picked up without an appointment from walk-in or drive through test sites from 15:30 every day. And the Scottish government is launching a new app - Check In Scotland - making it easier for businesses to collect contact tracing details. Among those reopening their business is Barry Cowan from The Walled Garden Touring Park, near Maybole in Ayrshire. He had to open his gates four hours earlier than usual to meet demand. He said the caravan park would be operating at half capacity so holiday-makers have more space.  But with restrictions on foreign travel still in place, Mr Cowan is booked into August and September. ""We can't wait, we're really, really excited and we're sure we're going to have a good season,"" he said. Kurt McGonigle is excited about reopening his tattoo studio Hepcat Tattoos in Glasgow is one of the ""close contact businesses"" that will be open for the first time in four months. Pent-up demand means most of Kurt McGonigle's tattooists are booked up for months to come. ""We were closed for four months so most of our income stopped, so we're all really excited to be going back to work and get back to normal,"" Mr McGonigle said. Steven Annand wants to see people able to enjoy alcohol inside pubs and restaurants Steve Annand, of drinks wholesaler Inverarity Morton, said the lifting of lockdown was ""a bit of light at the end of the tunnel - but there's still a good way to travel before we're back to normal levels"". Permitting bars and restaurants to serve drinks indoors will be the key to rebuilding after a ""really difficult"" few months. ""I think we need to get back to enjoying alcohol inside, in an indoor environment, in bars and restaurants,"" he said.

BBC Radio 5 Live This video can not be played Micheala says her condition means she is still worried about Covid. Michaela, who has spinal muscular atrophy, has said people should remember people who are shielding as lockdown restrictions ease. The condition puts her at very high risk if she were to get Covid. Michaela has gone from being very active to hardly leaving the house in over 400 days. She told BBC Radio 5 Live's Stephen Nolan: ""I think people donât understand that itâs their behaviourâ¦ which drives up community transmission."" Although she has had both vaccines, Michaela plans to keep shielding until cases have gone down further. Listen to 5 Live on the free BBC Sounds app. The Spanish city of Pamplona has cancelled the famous bull
running festival for the second year in a row. The San Fermin festival, which also features singing,
dancing and drinking, was due to be held in July. Mayor Enrique Maya made
the announcement in a news conference, telling reporters that the event would
be âvery high riskâ as the number of people vaccinated is still too low. Last yearâs cancellation
was the first in more than 40 years. More details now on news that the European Union has launched legal action against vaccine
manufacturer AstraZeneca. The European Commission â the EUâs executive branch â said it
was suing the company for not respecting its vaccine supply contract, and for
not having a âreliableâ plan to ensure timely deliveries. AstraZeneca said the move was âwithout meritâ and said it
would âstrongly defend itself in courtâ. The EU is struggling with the slow pace of its vaccine
rollout. A deal last August between the EU and AstraZeneca foresaw 300 million
doses for the bloc. However earlier this year AstraZeneca said its supplies
would be reduced due to production issues. Read

Gove denies the PM made any such comment. Labour MP Wes Street says: ""Can I ask him again to be absolutely categorical that he has
never heard the prime minister say those words?"" Gove says: ""I never heard the
prime minister say any such thing."" Plaid Cymru MP Hywel Williams asks: ""Is he confident that [the PM's] answer today is sufficiently comprehensive and sufficiently robust to lay these matters to rest?"" Gove replies: ""Yes"". Labour MP, Rachel Reeves, says the prime minister ""would rather that the bodies piled high than act on scientific advice"". She asks Gove to apologise for the ""the stomach-churning comments that have come out today."" Gove says Reeves suggestion that the government did not act on scientific advice is ""completely wrong"". He says: ""This government has initiated not just a second but a third lockdown in response to medical and scientific advice"" and ""ensured that we have had the fastest vaccine rollout in Europe"". He says: ""The ventilators that this government played a part in procuring are now saving lives in India."" Liberal Democrat Vera Hobhouse asks if the best way forward would be an independent public inquiry into the government's handling of the pandemic in ""order to get all the facts right"". Gove says: ""There will be a time for an independent public inquiry, and there will be lessons to be learnt, mistakes have been made."" Linda and Pat have been enjoying drinks in Bargoed, Caerphilly People in Wales have been making the most of the sunshine and the opening of pubs outdoors after rules were relaxed. Up to six people from six households are able to meet outdoors. Friends Linda Trollope and Pat Cooper have been enjoying a gin on the terrace of Murray's Sports Bar in Bargoed, Caerphilly county. ""It is so lovely just to be out in the open and in the sun again,"" said Ms Trollope. ""First drink of the year, we couldn't wait for it to open again, even if it is outside."" ""I wish I wore a t-shirt, instead of my winter jumper. We're celebrating in style,"" added Ms Cooper. Vaccine production needs highly specialised raw materials The US is making available crucial raw materials needed for
vaccine production in India, which is battling surging coronavirus cases. Less than 10% of Indiaâs population has so far received an initial
vaccination and Indian manufacturers have complained of shortages of vital raw
ingredients as they struggle to meet demand. Read

spread the infection of Covid-19 within Sweden in order to achieve herd
immunity? âNever, never ever,â was the answer given by the Swedish Prime
Minister Stefan LÃ¶fven today. He was facing questions from Swedenâs Committee on the Constitution, which has the job of
scrutinising the country's government and ministers and has been questioning a
range of high-profile officials and politicians in recent weeks. Last year Swedenâs Public Health Agency did suggest that by
leaving more of society open, higher levels of immunity would be a beneficial
side effect. But the government has repeatedly stressed that its initial
approach was to adopt measures designed to work in the longer term, rather than
going in and out of lockdown. LÃ¶fven told the committee that there was a clear
goal to limit the spread of infection and protect the most vulnerable. But the Swedish PM admitted that although his ministers had
agreed on a general approach to handling the pandemic, the government never
formalised or voted on a Covid-19 strategy. Sweden is currently experiencing a third wave of infection.
Almost 14,000 people have died since the start of the pandemic, and close to 1
million people have tested positive for Covid-19, in a country of just 10
million. Six people were reported on Monday to have died with coronavirus within 28 days of a positive test and there were 2,064 new cases, according to government figures. European countries have restricted non-essential travel from the US for more than a year Americans may be able to travel to the EU this summer if
they are fully vaccinated against coronavirus. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told the
New York Times this should be possible as both sides have approved the same jabs. However she did not give an exact timetable and said it
would depend on the âepidemiological situationâ. European countries have restricted non-essential travel from
the US for more than a year. The US still bans leisure travel from the EU and UK. There
have been some suggestions it could reciprocate in lifting restrictions but
nothing has yet been announced. The UK, which is now outside of the EU, is introducing a
traffic light system on 17 May that will set out its travel restrictions on
countries around the world. Read more here Nick BeakeBrussels Corrspondent Italy has relaxed restrictions on restaurants, coffee bars and cinemas Some of Romeâs most picturesque
locations have more of a buzz today. In Piazza Navona, American students Cora,
Mary Clare and Brianna were enjoying lunch outside for the first time in more
than six weeks â a moment that tasted even better as theyâd just finished an
architecture exam. But many tables nearby were empty. Dorian, their waiter who
was trying his best to coax any passers-by onto the terrace, said heâs been
encouraged by news that vaccinated American tourists would be welcomed to the
EU this summer. But theyâre not here yet and this is a country where many Covid
rules remain in place, including the 10pm curfew (for at least another month,
it seems) and the wearing of masks in public places. Christian, a dad of two who works in an hotel which has been hit hard by the lack of visitors, told us todayâs openings were âa sign that better days were on the wayâ. The famous marbled figures
that look out on Romeâs piazzas for centuries would still not recognise
this as being normal life. In her urgent question, the SNP's Alison Thewliss also says the public needed to know who benefitted from government contracts during the pandemic and what their links were to ministers. In response, Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove says every single recommendation for procurement of personal protective equipment went through an independent process and was verified by independent civil servants. He adds that the government did ""everything possible"" to make sure equipment got to the frontline and makes ""no apology"" for that. In an urgent question in the House of Commons the SNP's Alison Thewliss raises allegations that the prime minister said he would rather see ""the bodies pile high in their thousands""
than order a third lockdown. The Daily Mail reported,externalthat Boris Johnson had made the comments in Downing Street last November. The PM has denied making the comment -but sources familiar with the talks have told the BBC
he did. Thewliss describes the comments as ""despicable, cruel and callous"" and ""not befitting the office of prime minister"". In response, Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove says the SNP MP ""repeats a line from a newspaper but she ignores the fact
that the prime minister not only instituted a second lockdown but also a third
lockdown to keep us safe"". Dozens of puppies died with canine coronavirus after being transported in crammed cages, a court has been told. The dogs were found malnourished and dehydrated while being transported in a van from Cheltenham to Stoke-on-Trent, in England. Patrick Stokes, 24, who lives on a traveller site in Durham, was driving the unventilated vehicle and told police he ""wasn't selling the puppies"". Appearing at Cheltenham Magistrates' Court he admitted failing to ensure the welfare of animals in his care. Mr Stokes was found to have 44 puppies and two dogs. They were later tested for canine coronavirus and 20 results came back positive. Prosecutor Cathy Thornton said the infected puppies died in the following weeks, many by euthanasia. Read more. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst State media has recently tried to dispel fears about being vaccinated Today, Chinaâs
National Health Commission says that 224.9 millionvaccine
doses have been administered,external. China is onlyfive million
doses behind the US,external, and may soon overtake the States to become the country that has
administered more vaccine doses than anywhere else in the world. Despite this
momentum, in recent days, China has signalled concern that vaccination has not
been progressing as quickly as it would like. The country hasaims of vaccinating 40% of the population by the end of June, which at its current pace of around 3-4 million a day, would still be tens of thousands of doses short. State media
have recently tried to dispel fears about being vaccinated, noting concerns
among the public over adverse reactions and the safety and efficacy of Chinaâs
vaccines. Today,
however, the national Global Times newspaper says that more than 80% of people
surveyed out of some 12,000expressed
willingness to get vaccinated,external. Media have
increasingly tried to pin slim uptake on staff shortages, given thata
number of people have recently complained of difficulties at booking their
second dose. It is unlikely that there are
vaccine shortages; China says it has the capacity to produce 5bn doses
annually. Last week, the National Health Commission said that it would
âstrengthen supervisionâ over the accurate deployment of personnel for vaccine
administration. Alan Thompson had played bowls for 30 years but played his last game just a day before he had a stroke in 2018 The easing of restrictions in Wales from today means Alan Thompson, 74, will be able to step back on the bowling green for the first time in over three years after recovering from a stroke. While playing was banned, Alan, from Llantrisant, had been taking part in virtual games hosted by Sport Wales. ""I honestly didn't think I'd ever be able to play bowls again, but playing virtual bowls helped me ease back into it and I've found my confidence again,"" he says. ""I've done the rehearsal and now it's time for the real performance out on the green."" Meanwhile, in county Conwy, Nick Jackson's zoo is preparing to open its doors again to visitors. He said he was ""over the moon"" to reopen and staff had been working ""frantically"". He says: ""We're so pleased to be opening and getting income back, but it still hangs over our heads the worry as to what the future holds."" However, he thinks many of the zoo's animals - including primates and monkeys - will ""enjoy the company of the visitors coming in"" because they find them entertaining and amusing, he says. We're expecting an urgent question in the Commons at around 15:30 BST from the SNP on the Ministerial Code. Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove is expected to respond. He's likely to face questions about the prime minister allegedly suggesting that ""bodies could pile high"" during a heated discussion about lockdown in Downing Street last November. On Monday,the Daily Mail reported,externalthat Boris Johnson had said he would rather see ""the bodies pile high in their thousands"" than order a third lockdown. The PM has denied making the comment -but sources familiar with the talks have told the BBC he did. The Ministerial Code sets out the standards of conduct expected of ministers.

"The former chief executive of the Post Office has quit her roles on the boards of Morrisons and Dunelm following the IT scandal which led to the wrongful convictions of former postmasters. Morrisons announced Paula Vennells would leave after serving as a non-executive director since 2016. She is relinquishing her non-executive position at home furnishing retailer Dunelm with immediate effect. She is also stopping her duties as an ordained Church of England minister. Ms Vennells said: ""It is obvious that my involvement with the Post Office has become a distraction from the good work undertaken by the boards I serve. ""I have therefore stepped down with immediate effect from all of my board positions."" Ms Vennells was chief executive of the Post Office between 2012 and 2019. On Friday, 39 former Post Office workers saw their criminal convictions overturned by the Court of Appeal. Why were hundreds of sub-postmasters prosecuted? The convictions had been based on the flawed software system Horizon, which showed shortfalls in the sub-postmasters' accounts where they did not exist. The IT system was installed in 1999 under former chief executive John Roberts. Other appeals are expected to follow in what is the most widespread miscarriage of justice in the UK's history. The government has launched an inquiryinto the prosecution of the former Post Office workers. Ms Vennells said: ""I am truly sorry for the suffering caused to the 39 sub-postmasters as a result of their convictions which were overturned last week."" This video can not be played ""How do you die knowing that you've done nothing wrong?"" Ms Vennells said she now intended ""to focus fully on working with the ongoing government inquiry to ensure the affected sub-postmasters and wider public get the answers they deserve"". Dunelm's chairman Andy Harrison said: ""We respect Paula's decision to step down from the board and I would like to thank her for the positive contribution she has made to the business since her appointment in September 2019."" The chairman of Morrisons, Andrew Higginson, said: ""Paula has been an insightful, effective and hardworking non-executive director, and, on behalf of the Board, I want to thank her for her significant contribution over the last five years."" More than 700 people were wrongly convicted of offences of theft, fraud and false accounting, in prosecutions between 2000 and 2014, and some of them were imprisoned. Convicted Post Office workers have names cleared 'Post Office took us to hell and back but we won' Questions had been raised about the behaviour of Post Office directors during this time, and Ms Vennells, 62, faced calls to have her bonuses clawed back and be stripped of her CBE title, which had been given for ""services to the Post Office and to charity"". Jo Hamilton, one of the 39 former Post Office workers whose convictions were quashed on Friday, said Ms Vennells' role at Morrisons and Dunelm was ""untenable and I don't think she could stay"". Jo Hamilton saw her conviction quashed by the Court of Appeal last week She added that she would now consider shopping at the retailers after boycotting both when Ms Vennells joined their boards. Even during the pandemic when many supermarket online delivery slots were booked up, Ms Hamilton said ""I'd rather starve to death"" than shop at Morrisons. In a statement issued on Sunday evening, Ms Vennells, an associate Anglican minister in Bromham, Oakley and Stagsden, Bedfordshire,said she would be stepping back from her ""regular parochial duties"",external. Ms Vennells said: ""It is obvious that my involvement with the Post Office has become a distraction from the good work undertaken in the Diocese of St Albans and in the parishes I serve. ""I have therefore stepped back with immediate effect from regular parish ministry."" For the sub-postmasters and postmistresses who faced prison, criminal convictions and financial ruin after being wrongly pursued by the Post Office, one of the hardest elements has been confronting a faceless institution. But the name that has been repeated to me again and again by victims I've spoken to is that of Paula Vennells. Although the computer problems began before her tenure as chief executive, under her leadership, the glitches within the system became widely reported on. But she insisted the system was ""robust"", defending the technology and her organisation's actions to a committee of MPs. As chief executive, she chose to fight lengthy and expensive legal battles against sub-postmasters seeking redress. When more than 500 sub-postmasters won a civil court case against the Post Office in December 2020, the judge said that under her leadership the actions of the Post Office had been ""both cruel and incompetent"". She received a CBE for ""services to the Post Office"" in 2019. Since Ms Vennells stepped down as boss, there has been a dramatic shift in tone from the Post Office. It did not contest the vast majority of individuals who managed to overturn their convictions in the Court of Appeal last week. It has issued an apology and is already mentioning compensation. The Bishop of St Albans, the Right Reverend Dr Alan Smith, said that his father had been a sub-postmaster, adding: "" I express my distress at the miscarriage of justice that so many sub-postmasters have suffered."" He said: ""I am aware that there are still legal processes and inquiries to take place during which it is right that Ms Vennells stands back from public ministry."" Following the legal decision on Friday, Ms Vennells said she was ""deeply saddened"" by the sub-postmasters' accounts. She said she would cooperate with the government inquiry ""as I did with last year's select committee inquiry"". Tom Hedges (centre) was one 39 former postmasters celebrating as their convictions were quashed on Friday The Horizon IT system, installed by the Post Office in branches across the UK, was flawed from the start. At the Court of Appeal on Friday, Lord Justice Holroyde said the Post Office ""knew there were serious issues"" and had a ""clear duty to investigate"". But the Post Office ""consistently asserted that Horizon was robust and reliable"" and ""effectively steamrolled over any sub-postmaster who sought to challenge its accuracy"". Those affected have long called for a judge-led, full, public inquiry, rather than the government's own inquiry which is set to report in the summer. The Criminal Cases Review Commission, which investigates potential miscarriages of justice, is reviewing another 22 cases. There were more than 700 prosecutions based on Horizon evidence. The commission and the Post Office are asking anyone else who believes their conviction to be unsafe to come forward. Why were hundreds of Post Office workers wrongly prosecuted?

"Boris Johnson lives in Downing Street with his fiancee Carrie Symonds The UK's top civil servant says Boris Johnson has asked him to review how the refurbishment of his Downing Street flat was paid for. Cabinet Secretary Simon Case was responding to MPs' questions about how the work was funded. The row escalated after Mr Johnson's ex-adviser Dominic Cummings claimed the PM once planned to have donors ""secretly pay"" for the revamp. The PM has said any relevant donations will be declared ""in due course"". Labour has called on the Electoral Commission, which regulates political donations in the UK, to launch a formal investigation. The watchdog has said it is talking to the Conservative Party about whether the spending on the flat falls within its remit. PM's flat refurbishment: What is the row about? Johnson's 'bodies pile high' comments prompt criticism Five questions for the PM and why the answers matter Appearing before a Commons committeeon Monday, Mr Case said a review into the refurbishment would look at ""how this has been done"". Asked repeatedly whether he was aware if private donations covered any of the costs, he said he had ""not been involved directly in this"". ""I do not have all of the facts and details at my disposal,"" he said, adding that his review would probably take ""a matter of weeks"". Another day, another denial.  Another 24 hours when rather than making their arguments, the government is embroiled in arguments about the past. Whether it's the prime minister's alleged frustrations about lockdown, attacks from his former adviser Dominic Cummings, or the mystery over his expensive flat renovation, as one senior Tory put it, it matters, because it all relates to Boris Johnson's judgement. Many Conservatives have been confident however that the prime minister's reputation, his enjoyment for pushing convention, is something that many voters are even attracted to. But there's a risk that confidence could turn to complacency. There is a belief in the Labour Party that the unhappy mess is starting to be noticed by voters. And no one knows when, or what might next emerge. One cabinet minister told me ""there's nothing we can do to control it."" The claims about the flat are contained in a blog posted by Mr Cummings on Friday, his first since leaving his role in No 10. In the blog, Mr Cummingsalso deniedhe was behind the leaking of details of November's second coronavirus lockdown in England. Mr Case told MPs that an internal inquiry into that leak was ongoing, but it was ""probable"" officials working on it would fail to identify any sources. Meanwhile, Mr Johnson has denied reports he said he would rather ""let the bodies pile high in their thousands"" than order a third lockdown. TheDaily Mail reported,externalthe prime minister made the remarks during heated conversations within government in the autumn over lockdown restrictions. Sources familiar with the conversationhave told the BBCMr Johnson suggested he would rather see ""bodies pile high"" during the discussions. This video can not be played Simon Case was asked whether private donations funded work at the flat Like several of his recent predecessors, the PM is living in the flat above No 11 Downing Street, which is larger than the one above No 10. Speaking earlier, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said the prime minister had paid for the revamp ""from his own money"" . He said this came ""on top of"" public money from the annual Â£30,000 taxpayer grant available to all prime ministers for the upkeep of their accommodation. In awritten statement on Friday,external, the government said no money from this grant was spent in the 2019/20 financial year. Figures for this year are expected to be published in the summer. ""At all times the prime minister has complied with the rules. He's paid for it out of his own money, "" he said. Michelle Obama visited Samantha Cameron in the 11 Downing St flat back in 2011 Speaking to reporters on Monday, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer urged a ""full and transparent investigation"" into the allegations about the Downing Street flat, arguing they risked undermining trust in government. ""It's all very well the prime minister saying now 'I paid for it', the critical question was: what was the original arrangement - and why is it so complicated?"" ""If there's a straightforward answer, well give it. And if there isn't, then there are very serious questions to be asked,"" he added. A No 10 spokesperson said: ""At all times, the government and ministers have acted in accordance with the appropriate codes of conduct and electoral law."" Donations and loans to political parties of more than Â£7,500 must be reported to the Electoral Commission. The Conservative Party has previously said that all ""reportable donations"" are ""correctly declared to the Electoral Commission, published by them and comply fully with the law"". The party said ""gifts and benefits received in a ministerial capacity"" are declared in government transparency returns. Mr Case was also asked by MPs about the case of businessman Lex Greensill who was a part-time unpaid government adviser in David Cameron's government. The civil servant boss said that situation was not ""acceptable"" and that it ""looks like there were conflicts"". He added that he didn't think there was anything of that equivalent happening in the civil service now. The prime minister has already appointed the lawyer Nigel Boardman to hold a review into all the issues surrounding Greensill Capital. What is the David Cameron lobbying row about?

"Senior minister Michael Gove is answering MPs' questions about allegations relating to Downing St controversies Mr Gove says he finds it 'incredible' that Boris Johnson is quoted as saying he would prefer bodies 'piling up in the streets' rather than order a third lockdown MPs are also raising lobbying, PM's flat refurbishment and the ministerial code Senior civil servant Cabinet Secretary Simon Case is also responding to MPs' questions He says he is conducting a review into whether private donations have been used to refurbish the PM's flat Labour has urged a ""full and transparent investigation"" into allegations about the renovations Mr Case says ""work is ongoing"" on the Downing St leak inquiry - but says the leaker might not be found Edited by Julian Joyce That's all for our live coverage on this story today. But before we go, a word from our political correspondent Helen Catt. She says there have been an awful lot of allegations made in recent days, but the most striking is that Boris Johnson suggested that ""bodies could pile high"" during a discussion about lockdown. She says Michael Gove put up ""a robust defence"" against criticism of this in the Commons. And on Simon Case's questioning over the leak inquiry, she says it was ""interesting"" he said that given the amount of time had gone he didn't think it would be probable that they would actually find the source.   Labour's Rachel Hopkins says the public deserve to know what the prime minister said to Manchester United chief executive Ed Woodward in a meeting before the failed European Super League was announced. She asks if Michael Gove will commit to publishing all details of the meeting. Gove says that his understanding was the conversation was about the more broad opening up of sporting events and said that the Boris Johnson and Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden were ""wholly opposed"" to the super league. SNP MP Hannah Bardell quotes figures saying 53% of people in Scotland think that the PM is corrupt. She says the PM is leading a government that is ""rotten to the core"" and asks Michael Gove if he will ensure a public inquiry happens and recognise that people in Scotland have a right to decide their own future. Gove says it's important to stress ""that on each of the detailed questions raised I explained the position and it is not as the SNP would wish it to be"". Labour's Wes Streeting says the delay in locking down the country ""led to a higher toll in both in terms of lives and livelihoods"". ""What I don't think anyone expected was to read on the front of the Daily Mail today the quote that the prime minister said 'let the bodies pile high in their thousands"","" he says. He asks if Michael Gove if he has ever heard the prime minister say these words and that the prime minister has never said those words. Gove says that he ""never heard the prime minister say any such thing"". ""We were all wrestling with an incredibly difficult decision, the decision to lockdown necessarily raises costs in other ways, as we are all aware, but the prime minister not only concluded at the end of discussion we had...that it was necessary to have a second lockdown but also sadly that it was to have a third lockdown as well,"" he says. Conservative MP for Calder Valley Craig Whittaker says that while these matters should be transparent ""one could only muse what other world leaders think of the UK prime minister having to pay for his own refurbishment"". ""The ridiculous situation is why the prime minister should be paying anything at all personally, unlike other world leaders, when it is us the tax payer who demands that they live above the shop,"" he says. Michael Gove says that Downing Street is a working building and there is some money which is allocated so that prime ministers who work in that building can perform their duties. SNP MP Stephen Flynn also cites reports that the prime minister suggested ""bodies could pile high"" during a heated discussion about lockdown in Downing Street in the autumn. He asks whether Michael Gove accepts that a ""prime minister that does not put public health first is no prime minister at all? Gove says he was in the meeting that afternoon. He adds: ""We are dealing with one of the most serious decisions this PM and any government has had to face. ""The prime minister made a decision in that meeting to trigger a second lockdown. He made a subsequent decision to trigger a third lockdown. ""This is a prime minister who was in hospital himself in intensive care. ""The idea that he would say any such thing I find incredible. Referring to Mr Flynn's allegations Mr Gove adds: ""By seeking to make the points in the way that he does diverts attention from the fact that so many people that have been affected by this pandemic rely on the government, the NHS and others to strain every sinew. ""These decisions are never easy. But the government and the PM made the decision to have a second and third lockdown and I think we can see the evidence of the leadership that he showed then. ""Not just in the courage that he showed but also in the success of the vaccination programme."" Green MP Caroline Lucas says concerns about the prime minister and the ministerial code are not ""tittle tattle"" - referring to comments by the International Trade Secretary Liz Truss at the weekend. She says: ""If, as seems to be the case with our archaic and dysfunctional rules, it is the prime minister himself who decides if the ministerial code has been broken, should we be trusting this one with marking his own homework or should the whole system be revised?"" Michael Gove says there is an opportunity with the appointment of a new independent adviser on ministerial interests to look again at how that role may be strengthened if deemed necessary. Liberal Democrat Vera Hobhouse asks if the minister agrees that the best way forward would be an independent public inquiry into the government's handling of the pandemic in ""order to get all the facts right"". Michael Gove agrees that we need a public inquiry but ""it is important that we concentrate now on the successful vaccine rollout, on the roadmap and the lifting of restrictions"". ""There will be a time for an independent public inquiry, and there will be lessons to be learnt, mistakes have been made,"" he says. Labour MP Dame Margaret Hodge also brings up the cost of refurbishing the prime minister's flat. She cites differing statements within the last week about the upfront cost of the refurbishment, and asks: ""How many more times will government ministers accept that their leader has misled the public, the press and Parliament before they declare him unfit for office?"" Michael Gove says he thinks that the specific allegation Dame Margaret makes against the PM is one she may wish to reflect on. He says ""the PM paid for the costs of renovation, declarations are properly made about political donations and the cabinet secretary pointed out that he is making sure that everything that was done was done in accordance with the rules"". Shadow Minister for the Cabinet Office Rachel Reeves is up next. She begins by quoting the PM's forward to the ministerial code, and says he is ""corrupting the standard of life expected in high office"". She asks:  On the Downing Street refurbishment, Michael Gove says that previous prime ministers have used tax-payers' money to repair the flat. He says: ""This prime minister has spent his own money on refurbishing Downing Street."" On dealing with the pandemic, Gove says the government has initiated three lockdowns in response to medical and scientific advice. Gove says it is right to say that we should appoint an independent adviser on ministerial interests as soon as possible. He says the appointment is due within days, and the adviser will have the freedom to carry out their role ""in exactly the way they should"". Replying to Ms Thewliss, Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove says that the government ""operating at a time when the pandemic was raging"" did everything it could to make sure those on the front line got the equipment they needed. He says that Ms Thewliss repeated the line on ""bodies in the street"" from a newspaper but did not mention that the prime minister did introduce a third lockdown. ""What she doesn't acknowledge is the determined effort by public servants into his government and others to deal with the pandemic and save lives, instead she tries to score political points,"" he says. In the Commons main chamber the SNP's Alison Thewliss begins the urgent question by saying that Prime Minister Boris Johnson's alleged comments that he would rather see ""bodies pile up in the streets"" then introduce another lockdown are ""despicable, cruel and callous"" and says they are not befitting of the office of prime minister. She says that government contracts have been handed to those with known political connections and says that ""we need to know who has benefited and what their links are to ministers"". ""Will ministers stop hiding behind commercial confidentiality and publish full details of these VIP contracts along with who recommended them?"" she says, adding that it is ""our money"". She says in absence of an independent adviser on standards ""we can no longer trust them to investigate themselves"" and calls for a full independent public inquiry. Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent The bonnet is up and we're having a good old peer in. The inner workings of government - how it works, rather than to what end - is most often the preserve of the insufferably nerdy. I plead guilty. But the last few days act as an illustration of why this stuff matters. It is about what happens when those on the inside might assume no one is looking - and how good the rules are to regulate this behaviour. This afternoon we've heard from two of Westminster's most senior figures as far as all this is concerned. Two figures we rarely hear from in public: Simon Case, the country's top civil servant, and Darren Tierney, who is in charge of ""Propriety and Ethics"" at the Cabinet Office. If Mr Case did the same amount of physical stonewalling as he has rhetorical stonewalling in the last few hours, he'd have biceps like Popeye's. He's said - ad nauseam - that there's a limit to what he can say because of ongoing internal investigations. But bit by bit, inch by inch, new nuggets are emerging about what on earth has been going on.  Just before we  leave the committee hearing there have been more details on Mr Greensill's role in government. Darren Tierney says that while hisn team have not been able to find any contract there is ""some evidence that his appointment was signed off by the then-minister of the cabinet office and the then secretary of the cabinet office"". That would have been Francis Maude and Ian Watmore, he says. David Jones says he finds it ""rather alarming"" that Simon Case and Tierney come before the committee ""not knowing anything about the terms upon which Mr Greensill managed to be installed in Downing Street"". Case agrees that he finds it alarming as well. The cabinet secretary says that this is the purpose of the inquiry led by Nigel Boardman. We move now to the main chamber in the House of Commons. Michael Gove is now answering an urgent question on ministerial code from SNP MP Alison Thewliss in the House of Commons. Now on to questions about Greensill.You can read more on that here. Links between former Prime Minister David Cameron, the government and the finance company, Greensill Capital, have come under scrutiny from MPs and official bodies. Mr Cameron has been criticised for lobbying ministers on behalf of the company, in which he had a commercial interest. It's also been revealedhe contacted Treasury officials and the Bank of Englandin an attempt to gain Greensill access to a Covid loan scheme. David Jones asks: ""Was Lex Greensill employed as a special adviser at Downing Street?"" Simon Case replies: ""He wasn't employed as a special adviser."" Jones presses further on the nature of Greensill's role. David Tierney replies that his exact status is ""unclear"". He says: ""He was appointed as an unpaid adviser on supply chain finance in January 2012. He did that until 2015. ""In 2013 he also became a crime representative which lasted until 2016 when he left the Cabinet Office. ""His status as an adviser it's unclear what basis that has, that's something that we've asked Nigel Boardman to specifically look into. ""We've been unable to find a contract. What we've found so far are an appointment letter and then subsequent reappointment letters which set out some conditions on his appointment... 

So far we've been unable to identify a contract.""  Asked what there is to stop the prime minister being lobbied or blackmailed over a personal mobile phone, Simon Case says there are security packages ""around all the communications that ministers have by whatever means"". ""The level of security is increasing all the time,"" he says. Government-issued IT is generally more secure, he adds, with highly-classified material ""very secure"". Case says he thinks the idea of problems coming from ministers having personal phones is a ""bit of a red herring"". ""If it is government business then it is government business and needs to be declared and set out in the same way,"" he says. ""It is the means of technology which is changing rather than the fundamentals of needing to record government procedure."" John McDonnell asks Darren Tierney about how proactive the Cabinet Office's propriety and ethics team are in scenarios such as the chancellor's texts being published. Tierney says the team ""does not just wait for things to come to us"". He adds: ""The ministerial code is clear that it is for ministers to satisfy themselves that they are following the code, it's not for the Cabinet Secretary or I to police the code. ""That said we don't just sit there and let things go by, we will get involved in specific cases as necessary or at the advice of the PM. McDonnell asks Darren Tierney if he provided advice on any of the examples given. Tierney says: ""I don't think I want to get into individual cases. ""I don't think I want to comment on any ongoing case work that the team are doing. ""We're engaged on a range of issues that are live at the moment."" SNP MP Ronnie Cowan asks about what the impact has been of the resignation of the prime minister's independent adviser on the ministerial code five months ago. Sir Alex Allanquit after Boris Johnson backed Priti Patel over bullying claimsand has not yet been replaced. Simon Case says it is an important role but in his experience ""it has not had a particularly significant impact"" but said the prime minister was clear he needed to get a new adviser in post as soon as possible. Cowan then asks if the ""Greensill affair"" would have been different with an adviser in post. Case says the majority of issues to do with Greensill ""have related to former government ministers"" which would not have related to the independent adviser. He adds that he hopes a replacement will be appointed in ""days rather than weeks"" but says not to hold him to that. Tory MP David Jones asks about the cost of refurbishing the prime minister's flat, and whether it will be paid for through private donations. Simon Case says any costs beyond the annual Â£30,000 allowance ""are met by the prime minister privately"". On the use of a trust to pay for costs, Case says ""there's work been going on on this for 12 months"". He says that Chequers and other buildings are supported by trusts but that no trust for Downing Street ""currently exists"". He adds: ""Work was begun last spring and Lord Brownlow agreed to be chair of a putative trust. There was work done to identify cross-party potential trustees. ""On the trust itself, when I became aware of this earlier this year... we've been looking at this question in much more detail of how a trust could work, building on the models from elsewhere. ""This is a genuinely complicated legal policy proprietary issue. ""A charitable trust can't cover private areas of Downing Street, so it's clear that that can't be done."" Asked whether he is aware of any private donations made to fund the refurbishment of the PM's flat, Case says: ""The prime minister has asked me to conduct a review because I've not been involved directly in this.""

"Google design Google Argentina's domain name was bought by a web designer while the site was out of action for two hours in the country last Wednesday. Nicolas Kurona, aged 30, said he managed to buy Google.com.ar through a normal, legal process. ""I never imagined that it was going to allow me to buy it,"" he told the BBC. Google Argentina told the BBC: ""For a short term, the domain was acquired by someone else."" It added it had regained control of the domain very quickly. The story started when Nicolas was at his desk on the outskirts of Buenos Aires on Wednesday night, designing a website for a client. He started getting messages on WhatsApp that Google was down. ""I entered www.google.com.ar into my browser and it didn't work,"" he said.  ""I thought something strange was happening."" He decided to go on to the Network Information Center Argentina (NIC) - the organisation responsible for operating the .ar country code domains. He searched for Google - and up popped Argentina's Google domain available for purchase. Nicolas Kurona Despite thinking it would not work, he ""followed the steps and then I received an email with the purchase invoice"", he said. Nicolas shared the NIC invoice with the BBC. Google Argentina's domain name was acquired for 270 pesos (Â£2.08/$2.90). Dumbfounded, he tapped www.google.com.ar into his search bar and pressed enter. ""My personal data appeared,"" he said. ""I was frozen looking at the screen. I could not believe what had just happened."" At 21.52 local time on Wednesday, Nicolas bought Google Argentina's domain name. All of those millions of Google searches, and people coming to www.google.com.ar, were now in theory, coming to him. Screengrab of NIC page, allowing Nicolas to buy www.google.com.ar ""I want to make it clear that I never had any bad intentions, I just tried to buy it and the NIC allowed me to,"" he said. Nicolas's night had, in just a few minutes, turned into a major news story. ""When the purchase process was completed and my data appeared, I knew that something was going to happen... I was really anxious,"" he said. Nicolas tweeted what had happened - to try to clarify how events had gone down, he said. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Well, one theory is that Google had simply forgotten to renew its domain name. However, Google says its licence for the domain hadn't expired - and was not due to expire until July 2021. Open Data CÃ³rdoba,externalgroup (which is dedicated to tracking expired Argentine domains, and tracking registered ones) backs this up. It's still unclear why Google's domain name was released. Nicolas says he has no idea what happened, but it feels ""slightly strange"" to have so much media attention. He has been hailed as a hero in some corners of Twitter, and his tweet clarifying what happened has racked up 80,000 likes. Nicolas says he's just relieved that he didn't get into trouble. He says the NIC took the domain name away from him shortly after he purchased it, but his 270 pesos have not been returned. He says Google didn't get in touch, and that he wasn't paid. Google has yet to clear up how they got the domain name back. The company is investigating what went down on Wednesday.

"Britain is set for a ""sharp snap back"" in spending by shoppers as restrictions ease, according to experts at Deloitte. The firm found ""going to a shop"" topped the list of leisure activities people are most likely to do after lockdown. Separate research suggested that the UK's economy will grow at its fastest rate on record this year, helped by the rebound in consumer spending. The EY Item Club said the economy had ""proven to be more resilient than seemed possible"". The forecasting body has upgraded its 2021 growth forecast from 5% to 6.8%, which would mark the fastest rate seen since Office for National Statistics (ONS) records began. The UK's GDP, which measures all the activity of companies, governments and individuals in the economy, shrank by a record 9.9% last year as coronavirus restrictions hit output,according to the ONS.,external But EY expects that the UK economy will return to its pre-pandemic size in the second quarter of 2022 - three months earlier than previously forecast. Deloitte's research also suggested that the UK could be on track for a faster economic rebound than previously thought. Consumer confidence increased at the fastest rate in a decade in the first three months of 2021, according to its survey of 3,000 adults between 19 and 22 March. The survey found that six out of 10 people said they planned to return to the shops within a month of restrictions lifting. Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, said: ""The UK is primed for a sharp snap back in consumer activity. ""High levels of saving, the successful vaccination rollout and the easing of the lockdown set the stage for a surge in spending over the coming months."" Clothes sales boosted UK retailers ahead of reopening House sales and prices see early spring surge What is GDP and how is it measured? The economists at EY's Item Club also revised down their unemployment forecasts. The rate is now expected to reach 5.8% towards the end of this year, down from the 7% predicted in January. EY's chief economic adviser, Howard Archer, said that the latest forecast suggested the economy would ""emerge from the pandemic with much less long-term 'scarring' than was originally envisaged and looks set for a strong recovery over the rest of the year and beyond"". He added : ""While restrictions have caused disruption, lessons learned over the last 12 months have helped minimise the economic impact.""

Shops in Scotlandwill be allowed to reopen fully from Monday, whileNorthern Irelandis due to see non-essential retail reopen on 30 April. Separate research published last Friday suggested that the recent easing of lockdown measures had triggered a surge in activity among UK firms. A closely watched survey, produced by IHS Markit/CIPS, indicated that the looser restrictions had led to the fastest UK private sector growth since late 2013. The IHS Markit/CIPS Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 60 in April, according to initial findings, up from 56.4 in March. Any figure above 50 indicates expansion. The service sector grew faster than manufacturing for the first time since the Covid crisis began, the survey found, largely down to the reopening of non-essential shops seen in April.

Gove says that his understanding was the conversation was about the more broad opening up of sporting events and said that the Boris Johnson and Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden were ""wholly opposed"" to the super league. SNP MP Hannah Bardell quotes figures saying 53% of people in Scotland think that the PM is corrupt. She says the PM is leading a government that is ""rotten to the core"" and asks Michael Gove if he will ensure a public inquiry happens and recognise that people in Scotland have a right to decide their own future. Gove says it's important to stress ""that on each of the detailed questions raised I explained the position and it is not as the SNP would wish it to be"". Labour's Wes Streeting says the delay in locking down the country ""led to a higher toll in both in terms of lives and livelihoods"". ""What I don't think anyone expected was to read on the front of the Daily Mail today the quote that the prime minister said 'let the bodies pile high in their thousands"","" he says. He asks if Michael Gove if he has ever heard the prime minister say these words and that the prime minister has never said those words. Gove says that he ""never heard the prime minister say any such thing"". ""We were all wrestling with an incredibly difficult decision, the decision to lockdown necessarily raises costs in other ways, as we are all aware, but the prime minister not only concluded at the end of discussion we had...that it was necessary to have a second lockdown but also sadly that it was to have a third lockdown as well,"" he says. Conservative MP for Calder Valley Craig Whittaker says that while these matters should be transparent ""one could only muse what other world leaders think of the UK prime minister having to pay for his own refurbishment"". ""The ridiculous situation is why the prime minister should be paying anything at all personally, unlike other world leaders, when it is us the tax payer who demands that they live above the shop,"" he says. Michael Gove says that Downing Street is a working building and there is some money which is allocated so that prime ministers who work in that building can perform their duties. SNP MP Stephen Flynn also cites reports that the prime minister suggested ""bodies could pile high"" during a heated discussion about lockdown in Downing Street in the autumn. He asks whether Michael Gove accepts that a ""prime minister that does not put public health first is no prime minister at all? Gove says he was in the meeting that afternoon. He adds: ""We are dealing with one of the most serious decisions this PM and any government has had to face. ""The prime minister made a decision in that meeting to trigger a second lockdown. He made a subsequent decision to trigger a third lockdown. ""This is a prime minister who was in hospital himself in intensive care. ""The idea that he would say any such thing I find incredible. Referring to Mr Flynn's allegations Mr Gove adds: ""By seeking to make the points in the way that he does diverts attention from the fact that so many people that have been affected by this pandemic rely on the government, the NHS and others to strain every sinew. ""These decisions are never easy. But the government and the PM made the decision to have a second and third lockdown and I think we can see the evidence of the leadership that he showed then. ""Not just in the courage that he showed but also in the success of the vaccination programme."" Green MP Caroline Lucas says concerns about the prime minister and the ministerial code are not ""tittle tattle"" - referring to comments by the International Trade Secretary Liz Truss at the weekend. She says: ""If, as seems to be the case with our archaic and dysfunctional rules, it is the prime minister himself who decides if the ministerial code has been broken, should we be trusting this one with marking his own homework or should the whole system be revised?"" Michael Gove says there is an opportunity with the appointment of a new independent adviser on ministerial interests to look again at how that role may be strengthened if deemed necessary. Liberal Democrat Vera Hobhouse asks if the minister agrees that the best way forward would be an independent public inquiry into the government's handling of the pandemic in ""order to get all the facts right"". Michael Gove agrees that we need a public inquiry but ""it is important that we concentrate now on the successful vaccine rollout, on the roadmap and the lifting of restrictions"". ""There will be a time for an independent public inquiry, and there will be lessons to be learnt, mistakes have been made,"" he says. Labour MP Dame Margaret Hodge also brings up the cost of refurbishing the prime minister's flat. She cites differing statements within the last week about the upfront cost of the refurbishment, and asks: ""How many more times will government ministers accept that their leader has misled the public, the press and Parliament before they declare him unfit for office?"" Michael Gove says he thinks that the specific allegation Dame Margaret makes against the PM is one she may wish to reflect on. He says ""the PM paid for the costs of renovation, declarations are properly made about political donations and the cabinet secretary pointed out that he is making sure that everything that was done was done in accordance with the rules"". Shadow Minister for the Cabinet Office Rachel Reeves is up next. She begins by quoting the PM's forward to the ministerial code, and says he is ""corrupting the standard of life expected in high office"". She asks:  On the Downing Street refurbishment, Michael Gove says that previous prime ministers have used tax-payers' money to repair the flat. He says: ""This prime minister has spent his own money on refurbishing Downing Street."" On dealing with the pandemic, Gove says the government has initiated three lockdowns in response to medical and scientific advice. Gove says it is right to say that we should appoint an independent adviser on ministerial interests as soon as possible. He says the appointment is due within days, and the adviser will have the freedom to carry out their role ""in exactly the way they should"". Replying to Ms Thewliss, Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove says that the government ""operating at a time when the pandemic was raging"" did everything it could to make sure those on the front line got the equipment they needed. He says that Ms Thewliss repeated the line on ""bodies in the street"" from a newspaper but did not mention that the prime minister did introduce a third lockdown. ""What she doesn't acknowledge is the determined effort by public servants into his government and others to deal with the pandemic and save lives, instead she tries to score political points,"" he says. In the Commons main chamber the SNP's Alison Thewliss begins the urgent question by saying that Prime Minister Boris Johnson's alleged comments that he would rather see ""bodies pile up in the streets"" then introduce another lockdown are ""despicable, cruel and callous"" and says they are not befitting of the office of prime minister. She says that government contracts have been handed to those with known political connections and says that ""we need to know who has benefited and what their links are to ministers"". ""Will ministers stop hiding behind commercial confidentiality and publish full details of these VIP contracts along with who recommended them?"" she says, adding that it is ""our money"". She says in absence of an independent adviser on standards ""we can no longer trust them to investigate themselves"" and calls for a full independent public inquiry. Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent The bonnet is up and we're having a good old peer in. The inner workings of government - how it works, rather than to what end - is most often the preserve of the insufferably nerdy. I plead guilty. But the last few days act as an illustration of why this stuff matters. It is about what happens when those on the inside might assume no one is looking - and how good the rules are to regulate this behaviour. This afternoon we've heard from two of Westminster's most senior figures as far as all this is concerned. Two figures we rarely hear from in public: Simon Case, the country's top civil servant, and Darren Tierney, who is in charge of ""Propriety and Ethics"" at the Cabinet Office. If Mr Case did the same amount of physical stonewalling as he has rhetorical stonewalling in the last few hours, he'd have biceps like Popeye's. He's said - ad nauseam - that there's a limit to what he can say because of ongoing internal investigations. But bit by bit, inch by inch, new nuggets are emerging about what on earth has been going on.  Just before we  leave the committee hearing there have been more details on Mr Greensill's role in government. Darren Tierney says that while hisn team have not been able to find any contract there is ""some evidence that his appointment was signed off by the then-minister of the cabinet office and the then secretary of the cabinet office"". That would have been Francis Maude and Ian Watmore, he says. David Jones says he finds it ""rather alarming"" that Simon Case and Tierney come before the committee ""not knowing anything about the terms upon which Mr Greensill managed to be installed in Downing Street"". Case agrees that he finds it alarming as well. The cabinet secretary says that this is the purpose of the inquiry led by Nigel Boardman. We move now to the main chamber in the House of Commons. Michael Gove is now answering an urgent question on ministerial code from SNP MP Alison Thewliss in the House of Commons. Now on to questions about Greensill.You can read more on that here. Links between former Prime Minister David Cameron, the government and the finance company, Greensill Capital, have come under scrutiny from MPs and official bodies. Mr Cameron has been criticised for lobbying ministers on behalf of the company, in which he had a commercial interest. It's also been revealedhe contacted Treasury officials and the Bank of Englandin an attempt to gain Greensill access to a Covid loan scheme. David Jones asks: ""Was Lex Greensill employed as a special adviser at Downing Street?"" Simon Case replies: ""He wasn't employed as a special adviser."" Jones presses further on the nature of Greensill's role. David Tierney replies that his exact status is ""unclear"". He says: ""He was appointed as an unpaid adviser on supply chain finance in January 2012. He did that until 2015. ""In 2013 he also became a crime representative which lasted until 2016 when he left the Cabinet Office. ""His status as an adviser it's unclear what basis that has, that's something that we've asked Nigel Boardman to specifically look into. ""We've been unable to find a contract. What we've found so far are an appointment letter and then subsequent reappointment letters which set out some conditions on his appointment... 

So far we've been unable to identify a contract.""  Asked what there is to stop the prime minister being lobbied or blackmailed over a personal mobile phone, Simon Case says there are security packages ""around all the communications that ministers have by whatever means"". ""The level of security is increasing all the time,"" he says. Government-issued IT is generally more secure, he adds, with highly-classified material ""very secure"". Case says he thinks the idea of problems coming from ministers having personal phones is a ""bit of a red herring"". ""If it is government business then it is government business and needs to be declared and set out in the same way,"" he says. ""It is the means of technology which is changing rather than the fundamentals of needing to record government procedure."" John McDonnell asks Darren Tierney about how proactive the Cabinet Office's propriety and ethics team are in scenarios such as the chancellor's texts being published. Tierney says the team ""does not just wait for things to come to us"". He adds: ""The ministerial code is clear that it is for ministers to satisfy themselves that they are following the code, it's not for the Cabinet Secretary or I to police the code. ""That said we don't just sit there and let things go by, we will get involved in specific cases as necessary or at the advice of the PM. McDonnell asks Darren Tierney if he provided advice on any of the examples given. Tierney says: ""I don't think I want to get into individual cases. ""I don't think I want to comment on any ongoing case work that the team are doing. ""We're engaged on a range of issues that are live at the moment."" SNP MP Ronnie Cowan asks about what the impact has been of the resignation of the prime minister's independent adviser on the ministerial code five months ago. Sir Alex Allanquit after Boris Johnson backed Priti Patel over bullying claimsand has not yet been replaced. Simon Case says it is an important role but in his experience ""it has not had a particularly significant impact"" but said the prime minister was clear he needed to get a new adviser in post as soon as possible. Cowan then asks if the ""Greensill affair"" would have been different with an adviser in post. Case says the majority of issues to do with Greensill ""have related to former government ministers"" which would not have related to the independent adviser. He adds that he hopes a replacement will be appointed in ""days rather than weeks"" but says not to hold him to that. Tory MP David Jones asks about the cost of refurbishing the prime minister's flat, and whether it will be paid for through private donations. Simon Case says any costs beyond the annual Â£30,000 allowance ""are met by the prime minister privately"". On the use of a trust to pay for costs, Case says ""there's work been going on on this for 12 months"". He says that Chequers and other buildings are supported by trusts but that no trust for Downing Street ""currently exists"". He adds: ""Work was begun last spring and Lord Brownlow agreed to be chair of a putative trust. There was work done to identify cross-party potential trustees. ""On the trust itself, when I became aware of this earlier this year... we've been looking at this question in much more detail of how a trust could work, building on the models from elsewhere. ""This is a genuinely complicated legal policy proprietary issue. ""A charitable trust can't cover private areas of Downing Street, so it's clear that that can't be done."" Asked whether he is aware of any private donations made to fund the refurbishment of the PM's flat, Case says: ""The prime minister has asked me to conduct a review because I've not been involved directly in this.""

"Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been sentenced to a further year in prison and a one-year travel ban after being found guilty of propaganda against the Iranian government. Her lawyer saidshe was accused of taking part in a protest in London 12 years agoand speaking to the BBC Persian service. The prime minister said the UK would ""redouble"" efforts to free her. The British-Iranian charity worker was first jailed in Tehran in 2016. She has always denied the spying charges levelled against her. Confirming the latest sentence, her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, said the court's decision was a bad sign and ""clearly a negotiating tactic"" by the Iranian authorities - who are in the middle of discussions over the country's nuclear activities. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe appears in Iran court Who is Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe? 'My wife has been used as a bargaining chip' Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe has not been taken to prison yet, her husband said, and plans to appeal against the sentence. ""The threat is there, and the threat is bigger than we were fearing."" Mr Ratcliffe told the BBC. Referring to the possibility of being separated from his wife until summer 2023, he said: ""I think the worst case got a bit closer."" Mr Ratcliffe has not seen his wife in person since her imprisonment in 2016. Their daughter, Gabriella, who was with her mother in Tehran when she was arrested, has been with him in the UK since 2019. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""I don't think it is right at all that Nazanin should be sentenced to any more time in jail."" He said it was ""wrong that she is there in the first place"" and pledged to work hard to secure her release so she could return to her family, ""just as we work for all our dual national cases in Iran"". ""The government will not stop, we will redouble our efforts, and we are working with our American friends on this issue as well,"" Mr Johnson said. Mr Ratcliffe maintains his wife was imprisoned as leverage for a debt owed by the UK over its failure to deliver tanks to Iran in 1979. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's daughter Gabriella, now six, had counted down the days to her mother's release He says the case may also be caught up in negotiations over the international agreement to limit Iran's enrichment of nuclear material, whichthe UK and others are trying to revive. The sentencing may mean that part of the Iranian regime is unhappy with the direction of the negotiations taking place in Vienna and is signalling that things can get worse for Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe andother jailed dual nationals, Mr Ratcliffe said Last year, Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was moved from prison due to the coronavirus crisis and held under house arrest in Tehran until March, when her ankle tag was removed. But she returned to court later that month to face the latest propaganda charges. by Caroline Hawley, BBC diplomatic correspondent The new sentence is a bitter blow to Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and her family, who have campaigned relentlessly to get her home for five years. Mr Ratcliffe says the sentence is worse than he'd expected - but that a guilty verdict was guaranteed. He has consistently said that she's being held as a hostage on trumped-up charges - and fears that she will only be freed if Iran gets something in exchange. In this, the Iranian regime certainly has form. Last November, it released the British-Australian academic Kylie Moore Gilbert, who'd been sentenced to 10 years for spying. That was in exchange for three Iranian prisoners in Thailand - two of whom had been convicted over a bomb plot. And back in early 2016, when Iran's nuclear agreement came into force, Iran freed an American journalist, Jason Rezaian, in a prisoner swap. It's no coincidence, Mr Ratcliffe believes, that this verdict has come just as negotiations are taking place to revive the deal. Labour MP Tulip Siddiq, who represents the family's north London constituency, said they had been ""hoping and praying"" she would soon be free but instead she was ""being abusively used as a bargaining chip"". Ms Siddiq said the UK government's behind-the-scenes efforts to secure her release had ""clearly failed"", saying, ""We deserve an urgent explanation from ministers about what has happened."" Former foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt said, ""Iran's cruelty seems to know no bounds,"" but he questioned why the UK had not simply settled the tank debt, given it accepted it owed the money. Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesperson Layla Moran called for the government to impose targeted sanctions against the officials responsible in Iran. A medical evaluation carried out for the human rights charity Redress recently foundMrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and obsessive stress disorder due to ""traumatising experiences in the prisons of Iran"" and the uncertainty about her fate. This video can not be played Richard Ratcliffe: ""I think it was worse than I was expecting"" She told doctors that, during solitary confinement at the beginning of her sentence in 2016, she was interrogated - often while blindfolded - for eight to nine hours a day. Redress director Rupert Skilbeck said a further sentence could cause ""irreparable damage to her health"" after the ""torture and ill-treatment"" she had already been subjected to. ""Nazanin has never received a fair trial in Iran and is innocent of the allegations made against her. Her detention has always been illegal under international law,"" he said. ""The case must be dismissed and she should be allowed to return to her husband and daughter in the UK immediately."" Amnesty International UK's director, Kate Allen, said Mrs Zagari-Ratcliffe had twice had to face a ""sham trial"" in Iran. ""We fear that going back to jail will be almost too much for Nazanin to bear,"" she said. UNCONVENTIONAL WAYS TO EARN A LIVING:Stream Young, Welsh and Bossin' It now OH!

"Senior minister Michael Gove is answering MPs' questions about allegations relating to Downing St controversies Mr Gove says he finds it 'incredible' that Boris Johnson is quoted as saying he would prefer bodies 'piling up in the streets' rather than order a third lockdown MPs are also raising lobbying, PM's flat refurbishment and the ministerial code Senior civil servant Cabinet Secretary Simon Case is also responding to MPs' questions He says he is conducting a review into whether private donations have been used to refurbish the PM's flat Labour has urged a ""full and transparent investigation"" into allegations about the renovations Mr Case says ""work is ongoing"" on the Downing St leak inquiry - but says the leaker might not be found Edited by Julian Joyce That's all for our live coverage on this story today. But before we go, a word from our political correspondent Helen Catt. She says there have been an awful lot of allegations made in recent days, but the most striking is that Boris Johnson suggested that ""bodies could pile high"" during a discussion about lockdown. She says Michael Gove put up ""a robust defence"" against criticism of this in the Commons. And on Simon Case's questioning over the leak inquiry, she says it was ""interesting"" he said that given the amount of time had gone he didn't think it would be probable that they would actually find the source.   Labour's Rachel Hopkins says the public deserve to know what the prime minister said to Manchester United chief executive Ed Woodward in a meeting before the failed European Super League was announced.

Simon Case says it is an important role but in his experience ""it has not had a particularly significant impact"" but said the prime minister was clear he needed to get a new adviser in post as soon as possible. Cowan then asks if the ""Greensill affair"" would have been different with an adviser in post. Case says the majority of issues to do with Greensill ""have related to former government ministers"" which would not have related to the independent adviser. He adds that he hopes a replacement will be appointed in ""days rather than weeks"" but says not to hold him to that. Tory MP David Jones asks about the cost of refurbishing the prime minister's flat, and whether it will be paid for through private donations. Simon Case says any costs beyond the annual Â£30,000 allowance ""are met by the prime minister privately"". On the use of a trust to pay for costs, Case says ""there's work been going on on this for 12 months"". He says that Chequers and other buildings are supported by trusts but that no trust for Downing Street ""currently exists"". He adds: ""Work was begun last spring and Lord Brownlow agreed to be chair of a putative trust. There was work done to identify cross-party potential trustees. ""On the trust itself, when I became aware of this earlier this year... we've been looking at this question in much more detail of how a trust could work, building on the models from elsewhere. ""This is a genuinely complicated legal policy proprietary issue. ""A charitable trust can't cover private areas of Downing Street, so it's clear that that can't be done."" Asked whether he is aware of any private donations made to fund the refurbishment of the PM's flat, Case says: ""The prime minister has asked me to conduct a review because I've not been involved directly in this.""

It was the first excursion of the year for the train as Covid restrictions eased in Scotland. The train will run twice a day on the 84-mile round trip between Fort William and Mallaig. Tourist accommodation and visitor attractions can all now open again, and you can travel anywhere in Scotland. See other waysScotland got back on track today, here. BBC Radio 5 Live This video can not be played Micheala says her condition means she is still worried about Covid. Michaela, who has spinal muscular atrophy, has said people should remember people who are shielding as lockdown restrictions ease. The condition puts her at very high risk if she were to get Covid. Michaela has gone from being very active to hardly leaving the house in over 400 days. She told BBC Radio 5 Live's Stephen Nolan: ""I think people donât understand that itâs their behaviourâ¦ which drives up community transmission."" Although she has had both vaccines, Michaela plans to keep shielding until cases have gone down further. Listen to 5 Live on the free BBC Sounds app. The Spanish city of Pamplona has cancelled the famous bull
running festival for the second year in a row. The San Fermin festival, which also features singing,
dancing and drinking, was due to be held in July. Mayor Enrique Maya made
the announcement in a news conference, telling reporters that the event would
be âvery high riskâ as the number of people vaccinated is still too low. Last yearâs cancellation
was the first in more than 40 years. More details now on news that the European Union has launched legal action against vaccine
manufacturer AstraZeneca. The European Commission â the EUâs executive branch â said it
was suing the company for not respecting its vaccine supply contract, and for
not having a âreliableâ plan to ensure timely deliveries. AstraZeneca said the move was âwithout meritâ and said it
would âstrongly defend itself in courtâ. The EU is struggling with the slow pace of its vaccine
rollout. A deal last August between the EU and AstraZeneca foresaw 300 million
doses for the bloc. However earlier this year AstraZeneca said its supplies
would be reduced due to production issues. Read

Gove denies the PM made any such comment. Labour MP Wes Street says: ""Can I ask him again to be absolutely categorical that he has
never heard the prime minister say those words?"" Gove says: ""I never heard the
prime minister say any such thing."" Plaid Cymru MP Hywel Williams asks: ""Is he confident that [the PM's] answer today is sufficiently comprehensive and sufficiently robust to lay these matters to rest?"" Gove replies: ""Yes"". Labour MP, Rachel Reeves, says the prime minister ""would rather that the bodies piled high than act on scientific advice"". She asks Gove to apologise for the ""the stomach-churning comments that have come out today."" Gove says Reeves suggestion that the government did not act on scientific advice is ""completely wrong"". He says: ""This government has initiated not just a second but a third lockdown in response to medical and scientific advice"" and ""ensured that we have had the fastest vaccine rollout in Europe"". He says: ""The ventilators that this government played a part in procuring are now saving lives in India."" Liberal Democrat Vera Hobhouse asks if the best way forward would be an independent public inquiry into the government's handling of the pandemic in ""order to get all the facts right"". Gove says: ""There will be a time for an independent public inquiry, and there will be lessons to be learnt, mistakes have been made."" Linda and Pat have been enjoying drinks in Bargoed, Caerphilly People in Wales have been making the most of the sunshine and the opening of pubs outdoors after rules were relaxed. Up to six people from six households are able to meet outdoors. Friends Linda Trollope and Pat Cooper have been enjoying a gin on the terrace of Murray's Sports Bar in Bargoed, Caerphilly county. ""It is so lovely just to be out in the open and in the sun again,"" said Ms Trollope. ""First drink of the year, we couldn't wait for it to open again, even if it is outside."" ""I wish I wore a t-shirt, instead of my winter jumper. We're celebrating in style,"" added Ms Cooper. Vaccine production needs highly specialised raw materials The US is making available crucial raw materials needed for
vaccine production in India, which is battling surging coronavirus cases. Less than 10% of Indiaâs population has so far received an initial
vaccination and Indian manufacturers have complained of shortages of vital raw
ingredients as they struggle to meet demand. Read

spread the infection of Covid-19 within Sweden in order to achieve herd
immunity? âNever, never ever,â was the answer given by the Swedish Prime
Minister Stefan LÃ¶fven today. He was facing questions from Swedenâs Committee on the Constitution, which has the job of
scrutinising the country's government and ministers and has been questioning a
range of high-profile officials and politicians in recent weeks. Last year Swedenâs Public Health Agency did suggest that by
leaving more of society open, higher levels of immunity would be a beneficial
side effect. But the government has repeatedly stressed that its initial
approach was to adopt measures designed to work in the longer term, rather than
going in and out of lockdown. LÃ¶fven told the committee that there was a clear
goal to limit the spread of infection and protect the most vulnerable. But the Swedish PM admitted that although his ministers had
agreed on a general approach to handling the pandemic, the government never
formalised or voted on a Covid-19 strategy. Sweden is currently experiencing a third wave of infection.
Almost 14,000 people have died since the start of the pandemic, and close to 1
million people have tested positive for Covid-19, in a country of just 10
million. Six people were reported on Monday to have died with coronavirus within 28 days of a positive test and there were 2,064 new cases, according to government figures. European countries have restricted non-essential travel from the US for more than a year Americans may be able to travel to the EU this summer if
they are fully vaccinated against coronavirus. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told the
New York Times this should be possible as both sides have approved the same jabs. However she did not give an exact timetable and said it
would depend on the âepidemiological situationâ. European countries have restricted non-essential travel from
the US for more than a year. The US still bans leisure travel from the EU and UK. There
have been some suggestions it could reciprocate in lifting restrictions but
nothing has yet been announced. The UK, which is now outside of the EU, is introducing a
traffic light system on 17 May that will set out its travel restrictions on
countries around the world. Read more here Nick BeakeBrussels Corrspondent Italy has relaxed restrictions on restaurants, coffee bars and cinemas Some of Romeâs most picturesque
locations have more of a buzz today. In Piazza Navona, American students Cora,
Mary Clare and Brianna were enjoying lunch outside for the first time in more
than six weeks â a moment that tasted even better as theyâd just finished an
architecture exam. But many tables nearby were empty. Dorian, their waiter who
was trying his best to coax any passers-by onto the terrace, said heâs been
encouraged by news that vaccinated American tourists would be welcomed to the
EU this summer. But theyâre not here yet and this is a country where many Covid
rules remain in place, including the 10pm curfew (for at least another month,
it seems) and the wearing of masks in public places. Christian, a dad of two who works in an hotel which has been hit hard by the lack of visitors, told us todayâs openings were âa sign that better days were on the wayâ. The famous marbled figures
that look out on Romeâs piazzas for centuries would still not recognise
this as being normal life. In her urgent question, the SNP's Alison Thewliss also says the public needed to know who benefitted from government contracts during the pandemic and what their links were to ministers. In response, Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove says every single recommendation for procurement of personal protective equipment went through an independent process and was verified by independent civil servants. He adds that the government did ""everything possible"" to make sure equipment got to the frontline and makes ""no apology"" for that. In an urgent question in the House of Commons the SNP's Alison Thewliss raises allegations that the prime minister said he would rather see ""the bodies pile high in their thousands""
than order a third lockdown. The Daily Mail reported,externalthat Boris Johnson had made the comments in Downing Street last November. The PM has denied making the comment -but sources familiar with the talks have told the BBC
he did. Thewliss describes the comments as ""despicable, cruel and callous"" and ""not befitting the office of prime minister"". In response, Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove says the SNP MP ""repeats a line from a newspaper but she ignores the fact
that the prime minister not only instituted a second lockdown but also a third
lockdown to keep us safe"". Dozens of puppies died with canine coronavirus after being transported in crammed cages, a court has been told. The dogs were found malnourished and dehydrated while being transported in a van from Cheltenham to Stoke-on-Trent, in England. Patrick Stokes, 24, who lives on a traveller site in Durham, was driving the unventilated vehicle and told police he ""wasn't selling the puppies"". Appearing at Cheltenham Magistrates' Court he admitted failing to ensure the welfare of animals in his care. Mr Stokes was found to have 44 puppies and two dogs. They were later tested for canine coronavirus and 20 results came back positive. Prosecutor Cathy Thornton said the infected puppies died in the following weeks, many by euthanasia. Read more. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst State media has recently tried to dispel fears about being vaccinated Today, Chinaâs
National Health Commission says that 224.9 millionvaccine
doses have been administered,external. China is onlyfive million
doses behind the US,external, and may soon overtake the States to become the country that has
administered more vaccine doses than anywhere else in the world. Despite this
momentum, in recent days, China has signalled concern that vaccination has not
been progressing as quickly as it would like. The country hasaims of vaccinating 40% of the population by the end of June, which at its current pace of around 3-4 million a day, would still be tens of thousands of doses short. State media
have recently tried to dispel fears about being vaccinated, noting concerns
among the public over adverse reactions and the safety and efficacy of Chinaâs
vaccines. Today,
however, the national Global Times newspaper says that more than 80% of people
surveyed out of some 12,000expressed
willingness to get vaccinated,external. Media have
increasingly tried to pin slim uptake on staff shortages, given thata
number of people have recently complained of difficulties at booking their
second dose. It is unlikely that there are
vaccine shortages; China says it has the capacity to produce 5bn doses
annually. Last week, the National Health Commission said that it would
âstrengthen supervisionâ over the accurate deployment of personnel for vaccine
administration. Alan Thompson had played bowls for 30 years but played his last game just a day before he had a stroke in 2018 The easing of restrictions in Wales from today means Alan Thompson, 74, will be able to step back on the bowling green for the first time in over three years after recovering from a stroke. While playing was banned, Alan, from Llantrisant, had been taking part in virtual games hosted by Sport Wales. ""I honestly didn't think I'd ever be able to play bowls again, but playing virtual bowls helped me ease back into it and I've found my confidence again,"" he says. ""I've done the rehearsal and now it's time for the real performance out on the green."" Meanwhile, in county Conwy, Nick Jackson's zoo is preparing to open its doors again to visitors. He said he was ""over the moon"" to reopen and staff had been working ""frantically"". He says: ""We're so pleased to be opening and getting income back, but it still hangs over our heads the worry as to what the future holds."" However, he thinks many of the zoo's animals - including primates and monkeys - will ""enjoy the company of the visitors coming in"" because they find them entertaining and amusing, he says. We're expecting an urgent question in the Commons at around 15:30 BST from the SNP on the Ministerial Code. Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove is expected to respond. He's likely to face questions about the prime minister allegedly suggesting that ""bodies could pile high"" during a heated discussion about lockdown in Downing Street last November. On Monday,the Daily Mail reported,externalthat Boris Johnson had said he would rather see ""the bodies pile high in their thousands"" than order a third lockdown. The PM has denied making the comment -but sources familiar with the talks have told the BBC he did. The Ministerial Code sets out the standards of conduct expected of ministers. This yearsâ Oscars has not been received positively by critics. TV Line deemed the event ""a painfully earnest

"Daniel Kaluuya, Sir Anthony Hopkins and Chloe Zhao all triumphed at the awards Film drama Nomadland has scooped three Oscars including best picture, while British stars Sir Anthony Hopkins and Daniel Kaluuya have won acting awards. Nomadland's ChloÃ© Zhao made history as the first non-white woman and second woman overall to win best director. At 83, Sir Anthony is the oldest ever recipient of best actor; while best supporting actor Kaluuya is the first black British actor to win an Oscar. ""I did not expect to get this,"" said Sir Anthony, who missed the ceremony. British actress-turned-writer/director Emerald Fennell also won a screenplay award. The star, who plays Camilla Parker Bowles in The Crown, won best original screenplay for Promising Young Woman, which she also directed. The winners and nominations in full 'Sluggish' Oscars ceremony leaves critics cold 6 backstage bites from the Oscar winners 13 major looks from the red carpet Frances McDormand won best actress for her role in Nomadland, while veteran South Korean actress Yuh-Jung Youn won best supporting actress for Minari. The trophies were handed out in one of the grand halls at Los Angeles's stylish Union Station to allow for a Covid-safe ceremony, while many UK-based nominees were at a venue in London - although Sir Anthony was at neither. Olivia Colman and Sir Anthony Hopkins star in The Father Sir Anthony won best actor for his masterful performance as a man suffering with dementia in The Father, 29 years after he won his first Oscar for The Silence of the Lambs. His victory was the biggest surprise of the night. The award had been tipped to go to the late Chadwick Boseman, who died aged 43 last August, for Ma Rainey's Black Bottom. Sir Anthony was neither in LA nor at the British Film Institute in London, the ceremony's UK venue,so instead posted a message on Instagram on Monday morning,external. ""At 83 years of age I did not expect to get this award, I really didn't,"" he said in a video filmed in his ""homeland"" of Wales. ""I'm very grateful to the Academy, and thank you."" This video can not be played British Oscar winners celebrated with parties and sausage rolls Sir Anthony went on to pay tribute to Boseman, whom he said had been ""taken from us far too early"", and said he felt ""very privileged and honoured"". The Father, which will be released in the UK on 11 June, also won best adapted screenplay for Sir Christopher Hampton and director Florian Zeller, who called Sir Anthony ""the greatest living actor"". Why The Father will leave you disorientated The slow-burning drama about a woman living in her van in the American West after the financial crash won the top prize for best film, plus best director and best actress. McDormand, who now has three best actress Oscars, is one of the only professional performers in the film. Most of the rest of the cast is made up of real people playing fictionalised versions of themselves. In her acceptance speech, Zhao thanked the real-life nomads ""for teaching us the power of resilience and hope"". Before Zhao, the only woman to have won the directing prize in the Oscars' 92-year history was Kathryn Bigelow for The Hurt Locker in 2010. Director ChloÃ© Zhao makes history at the Oscars The Oscars as they happened A very different Oscars - small, muted and serious How to see the films in this year's Oscars race McDormand spoke of her hopes for the revival of big-screen cinema, asking viewers: ""One day very, very soon, take everyone you know into a theatre, shoulder to shoulder in that dark space and watch every film that's represented here tonight."" She then said: ""We give this one to our Wolf,"" and howled like a wolf - a tribute to the film's sound mixer Michael Wolf Snyder, who took his own life at the age of 35 last month. Meanwhile, black-and-white film Mank, which led the nominations with 10, picked up two awards, as did Sound of Metal, Judas and the Black Messiah, Ma Rainey's Black Bottom and Soul. The 32-year-old Londoner won best supporting actor for his incendiary performance as Black Panthers leader Fred Hampton in Judas and the Black Messiah. ""What a man. How blessed we are that we live in a lifetime where he existed,"" the actor said. ""I am humbled to be nominated for portraying a man whose principles I deeply respect and for guiding me to walk in his footsteps."" Kaluuya also paid tribute to his mother, who was watching at the BFI, who he said ""gave me my factory settings so I can stand at my fullest height"". But she could be seen asking ""What is he talking about?"" when her excited son told the global audience of millions: ""My mum met my dad, they had sex, it's amazing. I'm here. I'm so happy to be alive so I'm going to celebrate that tonight."" Yuh-Jung Youn with her Oscar Yuh-Jung Youn became the first South Korean actress to win an Oscar, for her role as the grandmother in Korean-American family drama Minari. She beat Olivia Colman, Amanda Seyfried, Maria Bakalova and Glenn Close to the prize for best supporting actress. It was Close's eighth nomination without a win. Youn told the crowd she ""doesn't believe in competition"" and paid tribute to her fellow nominee, asking: ""How can I win over Glenn Close?"" How a Korean family chases the American Dream in Minari The night's other British winners included Emerald Fennell for her first film as writer and director. Until now, Fennell has been best-known for appearing in front of the camera, playing Patsy in BBC drama Call the Midwife and Camilla Parker-Bowles in Netflix's The Crown. Her satirical thriller stars Carey Mulligan as a woman avenging the rape of her best friend. In her speech, Fennell recalled how they shot it in 23 days while she was heavily pregnant. She thanked her family, including her young son, ""who did not arrive until a couple of weeks after shooting, thank God, because I was crossing my legs the whole way through"". She is the first British woman to win the best original screenplay award since it was established in its current form in 1958. Mulligan rape revenge film 'deeply troubling' The other UK winners included Sir Christopher Hampton, who shared the best adapted screenplay award with Florian Zeller for The Father; and Atticus Ross, who shared the best score prize with Trent Reznor and Jon Batiste for Soul. Fellow Brits Andrew Jackson and Andrew Lockley won best visual effects for Tenet; James Reed won best documentary feature for My Octopus Teacher; and Martin Desmond Roe won best live action short for Two Distant Strangers, which addresses the police killings of black people in the US. Why Two Distant Strangers is 'important and necessary' Left-right: Mia Neal, Jamika Wilson and Sergio Lopez-Rivera won best make-up and hairstyling Mia Neal and Jamika Wilson became the first black winners of the best make-up and hairstyling award, triumphing for their work on Ma Rainey's Black Bottom. They shared the award with Spaniard Sergio Lopez-Rivera. In an impassioned acceptance speech, Neal said: ""Jamika and I break this glass ceiling with so much excitement for the future because I can picture black trans women standing up here and Asian sisters and Latinx sisters, and one day it won't be unusual and groundbreaking, it will just be normal."" The film also won best costume design for 89-year-old Ann Roth, making her the oldest woman to win an Oscar. Will Gompertz reviews Ma Rainey's Black Bottom The red carpet was set up outside LA's Union Station The ceremony was delayed by two months and was inevitably different this year. At Union Station, nominees walked an unusually sparse red carpet before sitting, spaced out but mostly maskless, in one of the station's converted halls. Like last year, there was no single host, so the show was introduced by director and Oscar-winning actress Regina King, who began on a political note. Referring to the conviction of former police officer Derek Chauvin of the murder of George Floyd, she said: ""If things had gone any different in Minneapolis I might have traded in my heels for marching boots."" Most nominees and winners were there in person, but some were in London, while others appeared by satellite from locations including Paris, Prague and Sydney.

"Senior minister Michael Gove is answering MPs' questions about allegations relating to Downing St controversies Mr Gove says he finds it 'incredible' that Boris Johnson is quoted as saying he would prefer bodies 'piling up in the streets' rather than order a third lockdown MPs are also raising lobbying, PM's flat refurbishment and the ministerial code Senior civil servant Cabinet Secretary Simon Case is also responding to MPs' questions He says he is conducting a review into whether private donations have been used to refurbish the PM's flat Labour has urged a ""full and transparent investigation"" into allegations about the renovations Mr Case says ""work is ongoing"" on the Downing St leak inquiry - but says the leaker might not be found Edited by Julian Joyce That's all for our live coverage on this story today. But before we go, a word from our political correspondent Helen Catt. She says there have been an awful lot of allegations made in recent days, but the most striking is that Boris Johnson suggested that ""bodies could pile high"" during a discussion about lockdown. She says Michael Gove put up ""a robust defence"" against criticism of this in the Commons. And on Simon Case's questioning over the leak inquiry, she says it was ""interesting"" he said that given the amount of time had gone he didn't think it would be probable that they would actually find the source.   Labour's Rachel Hopkins says the public deserve to know what the prime minister said to Manchester United chief executive Ed Woodward in a meeting before the failed European Super League was announced. She asks if Michael Gove will commit to publishing all details of the meeting. Gove says that his understanding was the conversation was about the more broad opening up of sporting events and said that the Boris Johnson and Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden were ""wholly opposed"" to the super league. SNP MP Hannah Bardell quotes figures saying 53% of people in Scotland think that the PM is corrupt. She says the PM is leading a government that is ""rotten to the core"" and asks Michael Gove if he will ensure a public inquiry happens and recognise that people in Scotland have a right to decide their own future. Gove says it's important to stress ""that on each of the detailed questions raised I explained the position and it is not as the SNP would wish it to be"". Labour's Wes Streeting says the delay in locking down the country ""led to a higher toll in both in terms of lives and livelihoods"". ""What I don't think anyone expected was to read on the front of the Daily Mail today the quote that the prime minister said 'let the bodies pile high in their thousands"","" he says. He asks if Michael Gove if he has ever heard the prime minister say these words and that the prime minister has never said those words. Gove says that he ""never heard the prime minister say any such thing"". ""We were all wrestling with an incredibly difficult decision, the decision to lockdown necessarily raises costs in other ways, as we are all aware, but the prime minister not only concluded at the end of discussion we had...that it was necessary to have a second lockdown but also sadly that it was to have a third lockdown as well,"" he says. Conservative MP for Calder Valley Craig Whittaker says that while these matters should be transparent ""one could only muse what other world leaders think of the UK prime minister having to pay for his own refurbishment"". ""The ridiculous situation is why the prime minister should be paying anything at all personally, unlike other world leaders, when it is us the tax payer who demands that they live above the shop,"" he says. Michael Gove says that Downing Street is a working building and there is some money which is allocated so that prime ministers who work in that building can perform their duties. SNP MP Stephen Flynn also cites reports that the prime minister suggested ""bodies could pile high"" during a heated discussion about lockdown in Downing Street in the autumn. He asks whether Michael Gove accepts that a ""prime minister that does not put public health first is no prime minister at all? Gove says he was in the meeting that afternoon. He adds: ""We are dealing with one of the most serious decisions this PM and any government has had to face. ""The prime minister made a decision in that meeting to trigger a second lockdown. He made a subsequent decision to trigger a third lockdown. ""This is a prime minister who was in hospital himself in intensive care. ""The idea that he would say any such thing I find incredible. Referring to Mr Flynn's allegations Mr Gove adds: ""By seeking to make the points in the way that he does diverts attention from the fact that so many people that have been affected by this pandemic rely on the government, the NHS and others to strain every sinew. ""These decisions are never easy. But the government and the PM made the decision to have a second and third lockdown and I think we can see the evidence of the leadership that he showed then. ""Not just in the courage that he showed but also in the success of the vaccination programme."" Green MP Caroline Lucas says concerns about the prime minister and the ministerial code are not ""tittle tattle"" - referring to comments by the International Trade Secretary Liz Truss at the weekend. She says: ""If, as seems to be the case with our archaic and dysfunctional rules, it is the prime minister himself who decides if the ministerial code has been broken, should we be trusting this one with marking his own homework or should the whole system be revised?"" Michael Gove says there is an opportunity with the appointment of a new independent adviser on ministerial interests to look again at how that role may be strengthened if deemed necessary. Liberal Democrat Vera Hobhouse asks if the minister agrees that the best way forward would be an independent public inquiry into the government's handling of the pandemic in ""order to get all the facts right"". Michael Gove agrees that we need a public inquiry but ""it is important that we concentrate now on the successful vaccine rollout, on the roadmap and the lifting of restrictions"". ""There will be a time for an independent public inquiry, and there will be lessons to be learnt, mistakes have been made,"" he says. Labour MP Dame Margaret Hodge also brings up the cost of refurbishing the prime minister's flat. She cites differing statements within the last week about the upfront cost of the refurbishment, and asks: ""How many more times will government ministers accept that their leader has misled the public, the press and Parliament before they declare him unfit for office?"" Michael Gove says he thinks that the specific allegation Dame Margaret makes against the PM is one she may wish to reflect on. He says ""the PM paid for the costs of renovation, declarations are properly made about political donations and the cabinet secretary pointed out that he is making sure that everything that was done was done in accordance with the rules"". Shadow Minister for the Cabinet Office Rachel Reeves is up next. She begins by quoting the PM's forward to the ministerial code, and says he is ""corrupting the standard of life expected in high office"". She asks:  On the Downing Street refurbishment, Michael Gove says that previous prime ministers have used tax-payers' money to repair the flat. He says: ""This prime minister has spent his own money on refurbishing Downing Street."" On dealing with the pandemic, Gove says the government has initiated three lockdowns in response to medical and scientific advice. Gove says it is right to say that we should appoint an independent adviser on ministerial interests as soon as possible. He says the appointment is due within days, and the adviser will have the freedom to carry out their role ""in exactly the way they should"". Replying to Ms Thewliss, Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove says that the government ""operating at a time when the pandemic was raging"" did everything it could to make sure those on the front line got the equipment they needed. He says that Ms Thewliss repeated the line on ""bodies in the street"" from a newspaper but did not mention that the prime minister did introduce a third lockdown. ""What she doesn't acknowledge is the determined effort by public servants into his government and others to deal with the pandemic and save lives, instead she tries to score political points,"" he says. In the Commons main chamber the SNP's Alison Thewliss begins the urgent question by saying that Prime Minister Boris Johnson's alleged comments that he would rather see ""bodies pile up in the streets"" then introduce another lockdown are ""despicable, cruel and callous"" and says they are not befitting of the office of prime minister. She says that government contracts have been handed to those with known political connections and says that ""we need to know who has benefited and what their links are to ministers"". ""Will ministers stop hiding behind commercial confidentiality and publish full details of these VIP contracts along with who recommended them?"" she says, adding that it is ""our money"". She says in absence of an independent adviser on standards ""we can no longer trust them to investigate themselves"" and calls for a full independent public inquiry. Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent The bonnet is up and we're having a good old peer in. The inner workings of government - how it works, rather than to what end - is most often the preserve of the insufferably nerdy. I plead guilty. But the last few days act as an illustration of why this stuff matters. It is about what happens when those on the inside might assume no one is looking - and how good the rules are to regulate this behaviour. This afternoon we've heard from two of Westminster's most senior figures as far as all this is concerned. Two figures we rarely hear from in public: Simon Case, the country's top civil servant, and Darren Tierney, who is in charge of ""Propriety and Ethics"" at the Cabinet Office. If Mr Case did the same amount of physical stonewalling as he has rhetorical stonewalling in the last few hours, he'd have biceps like Popeye's. He's said - ad nauseam - that there's a limit to what he can say because of ongoing internal investigations. But bit by bit, inch by inch, new nuggets are emerging about what on earth has been going on.  Just before we  leave the committee hearing there have been more details on Mr Greensill's role in government. Darren Tierney says that while hisn team have not been able to find any contract there is ""some evidence that his appointment was signed off by the then-minister of the cabinet office and the then secretary of the cabinet office"". That would have been Francis Maude and Ian Watmore, he says. David Jones says he finds it ""rather alarming"" that Simon Case and Tierney come before the committee ""not knowing anything about the terms upon which Mr Greensill managed to be installed in Downing Street"". Case agrees that he finds it alarming as well. The cabinet secretary says that this is the purpose of the inquiry led by Nigel Boardman. We move now to the main chamber in the House of Commons. Michael Gove is now answering an urgent question on ministerial code from SNP MP Alison Thewliss in the House of Commons. Now on to questions about Greensill.You can read more on that here. Links between former Prime Minister David Cameron, the government and the finance company, Greensill Capital, have come under scrutiny from MPs and official bodies. Mr Cameron has been criticised for lobbying ministers on behalf of the company, in which he had a commercial interest. It's also been revealedhe contacted Treasury officials and the Bank of Englandin an attempt to gain Greensill access to a Covid loan scheme. David Jones asks: ""Was Lex Greensill employed as a special adviser at Downing Street?"" Simon Case replies: ""He wasn't employed as a special adviser."" Jones presses further on the nature of Greensill's role. David Tierney replies that his exact status is ""unclear"". He says: ""He was appointed as an unpaid adviser on supply chain finance in January 2012. He did that until 2015. ""In 2013 he also became a crime representative which lasted until 2016 when he left the Cabinet Office. ""His status as an adviser it's unclear what basis that has, that's something that we've asked Nigel Boardman to specifically look into. ""We've been unable to find a contract. What we've found so far are an appointment letter and then subsequent reappointment letters which set out some conditions on his appointment... 

So far we've been unable to identify a contract.""  Asked what there is to stop the prime minister being lobbied or blackmailed over a personal mobile phone, Simon Case says there are security packages ""around all the communications that ministers have by whatever means"". ""The level of security is increasing all the time,"" he says. Government-issued IT is generally more secure, he adds, with highly-classified material ""very secure"". Case says he thinks the idea of problems coming from ministers having personal phones is a ""bit of a red herring"". ""If it is government business then it is government business and needs to be declared and set out in the same way,"" he says. ""It is the means of technology which is changing rather than the fundamentals of needing to record government procedure."" John McDonnell asks Darren Tierney about how proactive the Cabinet Office's propriety and ethics team are in scenarios such as the chancellor's texts being published. Tierney says the team ""does not just wait for things to come to us"". He adds: ""The ministerial code is clear that it is for ministers to satisfy themselves that they are following the code, it's not for the Cabinet Secretary or I to police the code. ""That said we don't just sit there and let things go by, we will get involved in specific cases as necessary or at the advice of the PM. McDonnell asks Darren Tierney if he provided advice on any of the examples given. Tierney says: ""I don't think I want to get into individual cases. ""I don't think I want to comment on any ongoing case work that the team are doing. ""We're engaged on a range of issues that are live at the moment."" SNP MP Ronnie Cowan asks about what the impact has been of the resignation of the prime minister's independent adviser on the ministerial code five months ago. Sir Alex Allanquit after Boris Johnson backed Priti Patel over bullying claimsand has not yet been replaced. Simon Case says it is an important role but in his experience ""it has not had a particularly significant impact"" but said the prime minister was clear he needed to get a new adviser in post as soon as possible. Cowan then asks if the ""Greensill affair"" would have been different with an adviser in post. Case says the majority of issues to do with Greensill ""have related to former government ministers"" which would not have related to the independent adviser. He adds that he hopes a replacement will be appointed in ""days rather than weeks"" but says not to hold him to that. Tory MP David Jones asks about the cost of refurbishing the prime minister's flat, and whether it will be paid for through private donations. Simon Case says any costs beyond the annual Â£30,000 allowance ""are met by the prime minister privately"". On the use of a trust to pay for costs, Case says ""there's work been going on on this for 12 months"". He says that Chequers and other buildings are supported by trusts but that no trust for Downing Street ""currently exists"". He adds: ""Work was begun last spring and Lord Brownlow agreed to be chair of a putative trust. There was work done to identify cross-party potential trustees. ""On the trust itself, when I became aware of this earlier this year... we've been looking at this question in much more detail of how a trust could work, building on the models from elsewhere. ""This is a genuinely complicated legal policy proprietary issue. ""A charitable trust can't cover private areas of Downing Street, so it's clear that that can't be done."" Asked whether he is aware of any private donations made to fund the refurbishment of the PM's flat, Case says: ""The prime minister has asked me to conduct a review because I've not been involved directly in this.""

BBC Radio 5 Live This video can not be played Micheala says her condition means she is still worried about Covid. Michaela, who has spinal muscular atrophy, has said people should remember people who are shielding as lockdown restrictions ease. The condition puts her at very high risk if she were to get Covid. Michaela has gone from being very active to hardly leaving the house in over 400 days. She told BBC Radio 5 Live's Stephen Nolan: ""I think people donât understand that itâs their behaviourâ¦ which drives up community transmission."" Although she has had both vaccines, Michaela plans to keep shielding until cases have gone down further. Listen to 5 Live on the free BBC Sounds app. The Spanish city of Pamplona has cancelled the famous bull
running festival for the second year in a row. The San Fermin festival, which also features singing,
dancing and drinking, was due to be held in July. Mayor Enrique Maya made
the announcement in a news conference, telling reporters that the event would
be âvery high riskâ as the number of people vaccinated is still too low. Last yearâs cancellation
was the first in more than 40 years. More details now on news that the European Union has launched legal action against vaccine
manufacturer AstraZeneca. The European Commission â the EUâs executive branch â said it
was suing the company for not respecting its vaccine supply contract, and for
not having a âreliableâ plan to ensure timely deliveries. AstraZeneca said the move was âwithout meritâ and said it
would âstrongly defend itself in courtâ. The EU is struggling with the slow pace of its vaccine
rollout. A deal last August between the EU and AstraZeneca foresaw 300 million
doses for the bloc. However earlier this year AstraZeneca said its supplies
would be reduced due to production issues. Read

Gove denies the PM made any such comment. Labour MP Wes Street says: ""Can I ask him again to be absolutely categorical that he has
never heard the prime minister say those words?"" Gove says: ""I never heard the
prime minister say any such thing."" Plaid Cymru MP Hywel Williams asks: ""Is he confident that [the PM's] answer today is sufficiently comprehensive and sufficiently robust to lay these matters to rest?"" Gove replies: ""Yes"". Labour MP, Rachel Reeves, says the prime minister ""would rather that the bodies piled high than act on scientific advice"". She asks Gove to apologise for the ""the stomach-churning comments that have come out today."" Gove says Reeves suggestion that the government did not act on scientific advice is ""completely wrong"". He says: ""This government has initiated not just a second but a third lockdown in response to medical and scientific advice"" and ""ensured that we have had the fastest vaccine rollout in Europe"". He says: ""The ventilators that this government played a part in procuring are now saving lives in India."" Liberal Democrat Vera Hobhouse asks if the best way forward would be an independent public inquiry into the government's handling of the pandemic in ""order to get all the facts right"". Gove says: ""There will be a time for an independent public inquiry, and there will be lessons to be learnt, mistakes have been made."" Linda and Pat have been enjoying drinks in Bargoed, Caerphilly People in Wales have been making the most of the sunshine and the opening of pubs outdoors after rules were relaxed. Up to six people from six households are able to meet outdoors. Friends Linda Trollope and Pat Cooper have been enjoying a gin on the terrace of Murray's Sports Bar in Bargoed, Caerphilly county. ""It is so lovely just to be out in the open and in the sun again,"" said Ms Trollope. ""First drink of the year, we couldn't wait for it to open again, even if it is outside."" ""I wish I wore a t-shirt, instead of my winter jumper. We're celebrating in style,"" added Ms Cooper. Vaccine production needs highly specialised raw materials The US is making available crucial raw materials needed for
vaccine production in India, which is battling surging coronavirus cases. Less than 10% of Indiaâs population has so far received an initial
vaccination and Indian manufacturers have complained of shortages of vital raw
ingredients as they struggle to meet demand. Read

spread the infection of Covid-19 within Sweden in order to achieve herd
immunity? âNever, never ever,â was the answer given by the Swedish Prime
Minister Stefan LÃ¶fven today. He was facing questions from Swedenâs Committee on the Constitution, which has the job of
scrutinising the country's government and ministers and has been questioning a
range of high-profile officials and politicians in recent weeks. Last year Swedenâs Public Health Agency did suggest that by
leaving more of society open, higher levels of immunity would be a beneficial
side effect. But the government has repeatedly stressed that its initial
approach was to adopt measures designed to work in the longer term, rather than
going in and out of lockdown. LÃ¶fven told the committee that there was a clear
goal to limit the spread of infection and protect the most vulnerable. But the Swedish PM admitted that although his ministers had
agreed on a general approach to handling the pandemic, the government never
formalised or voted on a Covid-19 strategy. Sweden is currently experiencing a third wave of infection.
Almost 14,000 people have died since the start of the pandemic, and close to 1
million people have tested positive for Covid-19, in a country of just 10
million. Six people were reported on Monday to have died with coronavirus within 28 days of a positive test and there were 2,064 new cases, according to government figures. European countries have restricted non-essential travel from the US for more than a year Americans may be able to travel to the EU this summer if
they are fully vaccinated against coronavirus. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told the
New York Times this should be possible as both sides have approved the same jabs. However she did not give an exact timetable and said it
would depend on the âepidemiological situationâ. European countries have restricted non-essential travel from
the US for more than a year. The US still bans leisure travel from the EU and UK. There
have been some suggestions it could reciprocate in lifting restrictions but
nothing has yet been announced. The UK, which is now outside of the EU, is introducing a
traffic light system on 17 May that will set out its travel restrictions on
countries around the world. Read more here Nick BeakeBrussels Corrspondent Italy has relaxed restrictions on restaurants, coffee bars and cinemas Some of Romeâs most picturesque
locations have more of a buzz today. In Piazza Navona, American students Cora,
Mary Clare and Brianna were enjoying lunch outside for the first time in more
than six weeks â a moment that tasted even better as theyâd just finished an
architecture exam. But many tables nearby were empty. Dorian, their waiter who
was trying his best to coax any passers-by onto the terrace, said heâs been
encouraged by news that vaccinated American tourists would be welcomed to the
EU this summer. But theyâre not here yet and this is a country where many Covid
rules remain in place, including the 10pm curfew (for at least another month,
it seems) and the wearing of masks in public places. Christian, a dad of two who works in an hotel which has been hit hard by the lack of visitors, told us todayâs openings were âa sign that better days were on the wayâ. The famous marbled figures
that look out on Romeâs piazzas for centuries would still not recognise
this as being normal life. In her urgent question, the SNP's Alison Thewliss also says the public needed to know who benefitted from government contracts during the pandemic and what their links were to ministers. In response, Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove says every single recommendation for procurement of personal protective equipment went through an independent process and was verified by independent civil servants. He adds that the government did ""everything possible"" to make sure equipment got to the frontline and makes ""no apology"" for that. In an urgent question in the House of Commons the SNP's Alison Thewliss raises allegations that the prime minister said he would rather see ""the bodies pile high in their thousands""
than order a third lockdown. The Daily Mail reported,externalthat Boris Johnson had made the comments in Downing Street last November. The PM has denied making the comment -but sources familiar with the talks have told the BBC
he did. Thewliss describes the comments as ""despicable, cruel and callous"" and ""not befitting the office of prime minister"". In response, Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove says the SNP MP ""repeats a line from a newspaper but she ignores the fact
that the prime minister not only instituted a second lockdown but also a third
lockdown to keep us safe"". Dozens of puppies died with canine coronavirus after being transported in crammed cages, a court has been told. The dogs were found malnourished and dehydrated while being transported in a van from Cheltenham to Stoke-on-Trent, in England. Patrick Stokes, 24, who lives on a traveller site in Durham, was driving the unventilated vehicle and told police he ""wasn't selling the puppies"". Appearing at Cheltenham Magistrates' Court he admitted failing to ensure the welfare of animals in his care. Mr Stokes was found to have 44 puppies and two dogs. They were later tested for canine coronavirus and 20 results came back positive. Prosecutor Cathy Thornton said the infected puppies died in the following weeks, many by euthanasia. Read more. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst State media has recently tried to dispel fears about being vaccinated Today, Chinaâs
National Health Commission says that 224.9 millionvaccine
doses have been administered,external. China is onlyfive million
doses behind the US,external, and may soon overtake the States to become the country that has
administered more vaccine doses than anywhere else in the world. Despite this
momentum, in recent days, China has signalled concern that vaccination has not
been progressing as quickly as it would like. The country hasaims of vaccinating 40% of the population by the end of June, which at its current pace of around 3-4 million a day, would still be tens of thousands of doses short. State media
have recently tried to dispel fears about being vaccinated, noting concerns
among the public over adverse reactions and the safety and efficacy of Chinaâs
vaccines. Today,
however, the national Global Times newspaper says that more than 80% of people
surveyed out of some 12,000expressed
willingness to get vaccinated,external. Media have
increasingly tried to pin slim uptake on staff shortages, given thata
number of people have recently complained of difficulties at booking their
second dose. It is unlikely that there are
vaccine shortages; China says it has the capacity to produce 5bn doses
annually. Last week, the National Health Commission said that it would
âstrengthen supervisionâ over the accurate deployment of personnel for vaccine
administration. Alan Thompson had played bowls for 30 years but played his last game just a day before he had a stroke in 2018 The easing of restrictions in Wales from today means Alan Thompson, 74, will be able to step back on the bowling green for the first time in over three years after recovering from a stroke. While playing was banned, Alan, from Llantrisant, had been taking part in virtual games hosted by Sport Wales. ""I honestly didn't think I'd ever be able to play bowls again, but playing virtual bowls helped me ease back into it and I've found my confidence again,"" he says. ""I've done the rehearsal and now it's time for the real performance out on the green."" Meanwhile, in county Conwy, Nick Jackson's zoo is preparing to open its doors again to visitors. He said he was ""over the moon"" to reopen and staff had been working ""frantically"". He says: ""We're so pleased to be opening and getting income back, but it still hangs over our heads the worry as to what the future holds."" However, he thinks many of the zoo's animals - including primates and monkeys - will ""enjoy the company of the visitors coming in"" because they find them entertaining and amusing, he says. We're expecting an urgent question in the Commons at around 15:30 BST from the SNP on the Ministerial Code. Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove is expected to respond. He's likely to face questions about the prime minister allegedly suggesting that ""bodies could pile high"" during a heated discussion about lockdown in Downing Street last November. On Monday,the Daily Mail reported,externalthat Boris Johnson had said he would rather see ""the bodies pile high in their thousands"" than order a third lockdown.

"Boris Johnson lives in Downing Street with his fiancee Carrie Symonds The UK's top civil servant says Boris Johnson has asked him to review how the refurbishment of his Downing Street flat was paid for. Cabinet Secretary Simon Case was responding to MPs' questions about how the work was funded. The row escalated after Mr Johnson's ex-adviser Dominic Cummings claimed the PM once planned to have donors ""secretly pay"" for the revamp. The PM has said any relevant donations will be declared ""in due course"". Labour has called on the Electoral Commission, which regulates political donations in the UK, to launch a formal investigation. The watchdog has said it is talking to the Conservative Party about whether the spending on the flat falls within its remit. PM's flat refurbishment: What is the row about? Johnson's 'bodies pile high' comments prompt criticism Five questions for the PM and why the answers matter Appearing before a Commons committeeon Monday, Mr Case said a review into the refurbishment would look at ""how this has been done"". Asked repeatedly whether he was aware if private donations covered any of the costs, he said he had ""not been involved directly in this"". ""I do not have all of the facts and details at my disposal,"" he said, adding that his review would probably take ""a matter of weeks"". Another day, another denial.  Another 24 hours when rather than making their arguments, the government is embroiled in arguments about the past. Whether it's the prime minister's alleged frustrations about lockdown, attacks from his former adviser Dominic Cummings, or the mystery over his expensive flat renovation, as one senior Tory put it, it matters, because it all relates to Boris Johnson's judgement. Many Conservatives have been confident however that the prime minister's reputation, his enjoyment for pushing convention, is something that many voters are even attracted to. But there's a risk that confidence could turn to complacency. There is a belief in the Labour Party that the unhappy mess is starting to be noticed by voters. And no one knows when, or what might next emerge. One cabinet minister told me ""there's nothing we can do to control it."" The claims about the flat are contained in a blog posted by Mr Cummings on Friday, his first since leaving his role in No 10. In the blog, Mr Cummingsalso deniedhe was behind the leaking of details of November's second coronavirus lockdown in England. Mr Case told MPs that an internal inquiry into that leak was ongoing, but it was ""probable"" officials working on it would fail to identify any sources. Meanwhile, Mr Johnson has denied reports he said he would rather ""let the bodies pile high in their thousands"" than order a third lockdown. TheDaily Mail reported,externalthe prime minister made the remarks during heated conversations within government in the autumn over lockdown restrictions. Sources familiar with the conversationhave told the BBCMr Johnson suggested he would rather see ""bodies pile high"" during the discussions. This video can not be played Simon Case was asked whether private donations funded work at the flat Like several of his recent predecessors, the PM is living in the flat above No 11 Downing Street, which is larger than the one above No 10. Speaking earlier, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said the prime minister had paid for the revamp ""from his own money"" . He said this came ""on top of"" public money from the annual Â£30,000 taxpayer grant available to all prime ministers for the upkeep of their accommodation. In awritten statement on Friday,external, the government said no money from this grant was spent in the 2019/20 financial year. Figures for this year are expected to be published in the summer. ""At all times the prime minister has complied with the rules. He's paid for it out of his own money, "" he said. Michelle Obama visited Samantha Cameron in the 11 Downing St flat back in 2011 Speaking to reporters on Monday, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer urged a ""full and transparent investigation"" into the allegations about the Downing Street flat, arguing they risked undermining trust in government. ""It's all very well the prime minister saying now 'I paid for it', the critical question was: what was the original arrangement - and why is it so complicated?"" ""If there's a straightforward answer, well give it. And if there isn't, then there are very serious questions to be asked,"" he added. A No 10 spokesperson said: ""At all times, the government and ministers have acted in accordance with the appropriate codes of conduct and electoral law."" Donations and loans to political parties of more than Â£7,500 must be reported to the Electoral Commission. The Conservative Party has previously said that all ""reportable donations"" are ""correctly declared to the Electoral Commission, published by them and comply fully with the law"". The party said ""gifts and benefits received in a ministerial capacity"" are declared in government transparency returns. Mr Case was also asked by MPs about the case of businessman Lex Greensill who was a part-time unpaid government adviser in David Cameron's government. The civil servant boss said that situation was not ""acceptable"" and that it ""looks like there were conflicts"". He added that he didn't think there was anything of that equivalent happening in the civil service now. The prime minister has already appointed the lawyer Nigel Boardman to hold a review into all the issues surrounding Greensill Capital. What is the David Cameron lobbying row about?

"Daniel Kaluuya, Sir Anthony Hopkins and Chloe Zhao all triumphed at the awards Film drama Nomadland has scooped three Oscars including best picture, while British stars Sir Anthony Hopkins and Daniel Kaluuya have won acting awards. Nomadland's ChloÃ© Zhao made history as the first non-white woman and second woman overall to win best director. At 83, Sir Anthony is the oldest ever recipient of best actor; while best supporting actor Kaluuya is the first black British actor to win an Oscar. ""I did not expect to get this,"" said Sir Anthony, who missed the ceremony. British actress-turned-writer/director Emerald Fennell also won a screenplay award. The star, who plays Camilla Parker Bowles in The Crown, won best original screenplay for Promising Young Woman, which she also directed. The winners and nominations in full 'Sluggish' Oscars ceremony leaves critics cold 6 backstage bites from the Oscar winners 13 major looks from the red carpet Frances McDormand won best actress for her role in Nomadland, while veteran South Korean actress Yuh-Jung Youn won best supporting actress for Minari. The trophies were handed out in one of the grand halls at Los Angeles's stylish Union Station to allow for a Covid-safe ceremony, while many UK-based nominees were at a venue in London - although Sir Anthony was at neither. Olivia Colman and Sir Anthony Hopkins star in The Father Sir Anthony won best actor for his masterful performance as a man suffering with dementia in The Father, 29 years after he won his first Oscar for The Silence of the Lambs. His victory was the biggest surprise of the night. The award had been tipped to go to the late Chadwick Boseman, who died aged 43 last August, for Ma Rainey's Black Bottom. Sir Anthony was neither in LA nor at the British Film Institute in London, the ceremony's UK venue,so instead posted a message on Instagram on Monday morning,external. ""At 83 years of age I did not expect to get this award, I really didn't,"" he said in a video filmed in his ""homeland"" of Wales. ""I'm very grateful to the Academy, and thank you."" This video can not be played British Oscar winners celebrated with parties and sausage rolls Sir Anthony went on to pay tribute to Boseman, whom he said had been ""taken from us far too early"", and said he felt ""very privileged and honoured"". The Father, which will be released in the UK on 11 June, also won best adapted screenplay for Sir Christopher Hampton and director Florian Zeller, who called Sir Anthony ""the greatest living actor"". Why The Father will leave you disorientated The slow-burning drama about a woman living in her van in the American West after the financial crash won the top prize for best film, plus best director and best actress. McDormand, who now has three best actress Oscars, is one of the only professional performers in the film. Most of the rest of the cast is made up of real people playing fictionalised versions of themselves. In her acceptance speech, Zhao thanked the real-life nomads ""for teaching us the power of resilience and hope"". Before Zhao, the only woman to have won the directing prize in the Oscars' 92-year history was Kathryn Bigelow for The Hurt Locker in 2010. Director ChloÃ© Zhao makes history at the Oscars The Oscars as they happened A very different Oscars - small, muted and serious How to see the films in this year's Oscars race McDormand spoke of her hopes for the revival of big-screen cinema, asking viewers: ""One day very, very soon, take everyone you know into a theatre, shoulder to shoulder in that dark space and watch every film that's represented here tonight."" She then said: ""We give this one to our Wolf,"" and howled like a wolf - a tribute to the film's sound mixer Michael Wolf Snyder, who took his own life at the age of 35 last month. Meanwhile, black-and-white film Mank, which led the nominations with 10, picked up two awards, as did Sound of Metal, Judas and the Black Messiah, Ma Rainey's Black Bottom and Soul. The 32-year-old Londoner won best supporting actor for his incendiary performance as Black Panthers leader Fred Hampton in Judas and the Black Messiah. ""What a man. How blessed we are that we live in a lifetime where he existed,"" the actor said. ""I am humbled to be nominated for portraying a man whose principles I deeply respect and for guiding me to walk in his footsteps."" Kaluuya also paid tribute to his mother, who was watching at the BFI, who he said ""gave me my factory settings so I can stand at my fullest height"". But she could be seen asking ""What is he talking about?"" when her excited son told the global audience of millions: ""My mum met my dad, they had sex, it's amazing. I'm here. I'm so happy to be alive so I'm going to celebrate that tonight."" Yuh-Jung Youn with her Oscar Yuh-Jung Youn became the first South Korean actress to win an Oscar, for her role as the grandmother in Korean-American family drama Minari. She beat Olivia Colman, Amanda Seyfried, Maria Bakalova and Glenn Close to the prize for best supporting actress. It was Close's eighth nomination without a win. Youn told the crowd she ""doesn't believe in competition"" and paid tribute to her fellow nominee, asking: ""How can I win over Glenn Close?"" How a Korean family chases the American Dream in Minari The night's other British winners included Emerald Fennell for her first film as writer and director. Until now, Fennell has been best-known for appearing in front of the camera, playing Patsy in BBC drama Call the Midwife and Camilla Parker-Bowles in Netflix's The Crown. Her satirical thriller stars Carey Mulligan as a woman avenging the rape of her best friend. In her speech, Fennell recalled how they shot it in 23 days while she was heavily pregnant. She thanked her family, including her young son, ""who did not arrive until a couple of weeks after shooting, thank God, because I was crossing my legs the whole way through"". She is the first British woman to win the best original screenplay award since it was established in its current form in 1958. Mulligan rape revenge film 'deeply troubling' The other UK winners included Sir Christopher Hampton, who shared the best adapted screenplay award with Florian Zeller for The Father; and Atticus Ross, who shared the best score prize with Trent Reznor and Jon Batiste for Soul. Fellow Brits Andrew Jackson and Andrew Lockley won best visual effects for Tenet; James Reed won best documentary feature for My Octopus Teacher; and Martin Desmond Roe won best live action short for Two Distant Strangers, which addresses the police killings of black people in the US. Why Two Distant Strangers is 'important and necessary' Left-right: Mia Neal, Jamika Wilson and Sergio Lopez-Rivera won best make-up and hairstyling Mia Neal and Jamika Wilson became the first black winners of the best make-up and hairstyling award, triumphing for their work on Ma Rainey's Black Bottom. They shared the award with Spaniard Sergio Lopez-Rivera. In an impassioned acceptance speech, Neal said: ""Jamika and I break this glass ceiling with so much excitement for the future because I can picture black trans women standing up here and Asian sisters and Latinx sisters, and one day it won't be unusual and groundbreaking, it will just be normal."" The film also won best costume design for 89-year-old Ann Roth, making her the oldest woman to win an Oscar. Will Gompertz reviews Ma Rainey's Black Bottom The red carpet was set up outside LA's Union Station The ceremony was delayed by two months and was inevitably different this year. At Union Station, nominees walked an unusually sparse red carpet before sitting, spaced out but mostly maskless, in one of the station's converted halls. Like last year, there was no single host, so the show was introduced by director and Oscar-winning actress Regina King, who began on a political note. Referring to the conviction of former police officer Derek Chauvin of the murder of George Floyd, she said: ""If things had gone any different in Minneapolis I might have traded in my heels for marching boots."" Most nominees and winners were there in person, but some were in London, while others appeared by satellite from locations including Paris, Prague and Sydney.

"Boris Johnson lives in Downing Street with his fiancee Carrie Symonds The UK's top civil servant says Boris Johnson has asked him to review how the refurbishment of his Downing Street flat was paid for. Cabinet Secretary Simon Case was responding to MPs' questions about how the work was funded. The row escalated after Mr Johnson's ex-adviser Dominic Cummings claimed the PM once planned to have donors ""secretly pay"" for the revamp.

"The former chief executive of the Post Office has quit her roles on the boards of Morrisons and Dunelm following the IT scandal which led to the wrongful convictions of former postmasters. Morrisons announced Paula Vennells would leave after serving as a non-executive director since 2016. She is relinquishing her non-executive position at home furnishing retailer Dunelm with immediate effect. She is also stopping her duties as an ordained Church of England minister. Ms Vennells said: ""It is obvious that my involvement with the Post Office has become a distraction from the good work undertaken by the boards I serve. ""I have therefore stepped down with immediate effect from all of my board positions."" Ms Vennells was chief executive of the Post Office between 2012 and 2019. On Friday, 39 former Post Office workers saw their criminal convictions overturned by the Court of Appeal. Why were hundreds of sub-postmasters prosecuted? The convictions had been based on the flawed software system Horizon, which showed shortfalls in the sub-postmasters' accounts where they did not exist. The IT system was installed in 1999 under former chief executive John Roberts. Other appeals are expected to follow in what is the most widespread miscarriage of justice in the UK's history. The government has launched an inquiryinto the prosecution of the former Post Office workers. Ms Vennells said: ""I am truly sorry for the suffering caused to the 39 sub-postmasters as a result of their convictions which were overturned last week."" This video can not be played ""How do you die knowing that you've done nothing wrong?"" Ms Vennells said she now intended ""to focus fully on working with the ongoing government inquiry to ensure the affected sub-postmasters and wider public get the answers they deserve"". Dunelm's chairman Andy Harrison said: ""We respect Paula's decision to step down from the board and I would like to thank her for the positive contribution she has made to the business since her appointment in September 2019."" The chairman of Morrisons, Andrew Higginson, said: ""Paula has been an insightful, effective and hardworking non-executive director, and, on behalf of the Board, I want to thank her for her significant contribution over the last five years."" More than 700 people were wrongly convicted of offences of theft, fraud and false accounting, in prosecutions between 2000 and 2014, and some of them were imprisoned. Convicted Post Office workers have names cleared 'Post Office took us to hell and back but we won' Questions had been raised about the behaviour of Post Office directors during this time, and Ms Vennells, 62, faced calls to have her bonuses clawed back and be stripped of her CBE title, which had been given for ""services to the Post Office and to charity"". Jo Hamilton, one of the 39 former Post Office workers whose convictions were quashed on Friday, said Ms Vennells' role at Morrisons and Dunelm was ""untenable and I don't think she could stay"". Jo Hamilton saw her conviction quashed by the Court of Appeal last week She added that she would now consider shopping at the retailers after boycotting both when Ms Vennells joined their boards. Even during the pandemic when many supermarket online delivery slots were booked up, Ms Hamilton said ""I'd rather starve to death"" than shop at Morrisons. In a statement issued on Sunday evening, Ms Vennells, an associate Anglican minister in Bromham, Oakley and Stagsden, Bedfordshire,said she would be stepping back from her ""regular parochial duties"",external. Ms Vennells said: ""It is obvious that my involvement with the Post Office has become a distraction from the good work undertaken in the Diocese of St Albans and in the parishes I serve. ""I have therefore stepped back with immediate effect from regular parish ministry."" For the sub-postmasters and postmistresses who faced prison, criminal convictions and financial ruin after being wrongly pursued by the Post Office, one of the hardest elements has been confronting a faceless institution. But the name that has been repeated to me again and again by victims I've spoken to is that of Paula Vennells. Although the computer problems began before her tenure as chief executive, under her leadership, the glitches within the system became widely reported on. But she insisted the system was ""robust"", defending the technology and her organisation's actions to a committee of MPs. As chief executive, she chose to fight lengthy and expensive legal battles against sub-postmasters seeking redress. When more than 500 sub-postmasters won a civil court case against the Post Office in December 2020, the judge said that under her leadership the actions of the Post Office had been ""both cruel and incompetent"". She received a CBE for ""services to the Post Office"" in 2019. Since Ms Vennells stepped down as boss, there has been a dramatic shift in tone from the Post Office. It did not contest the vast majority of individuals who managed to overturn their convictions in the Court of Appeal last week. It has issued an apology and is already mentioning compensation. The Bishop of St Albans, the Right Reverend Dr Alan Smith, said that his father had been a sub-postmaster, adding: "" I express my distress at the miscarriage of justice that so many sub-postmasters have suffered."" He said: ""I am aware that there are still legal processes and inquiries to take place during which it is right that Ms Vennells stands back from public ministry."" Following the legal decision on Friday, Ms Vennells said she was ""deeply saddened"" by the sub-postmasters' accounts. She said she would cooperate with the government inquiry ""as I did with last year's select committee inquiry"". Tom Hedges (centre) was one 39 former postmasters celebrating as their convictions were quashed on Friday The Horizon IT system, installed by the Post Office in branches across the UK, was flawed from the start. At the Court of Appeal on Friday, Lord Justice Holroyde said the Post Office ""knew there were serious issues"" and had a ""clear duty to investigate"". But the Post Office ""consistently asserted that Horizon was robust and reliable"" and ""effectively steamrolled over any sub-postmaster who sought to challenge its accuracy"". Those affected have long called for a judge-led, full, public inquiry, rather than the government's own inquiry which is set to report in the summer. The Criminal Cases Review Commission, which investigates potential miscarriages of justice, is reviewing another 22 cases. There were more than 700 prosecutions based on Horizon evidence. The commission and the Post Office are asking anyone else who believes their conviction to be unsafe to come forward. Why were hundreds of Post Office workers wrongly prosecuted?

"ChloÃ© Zhao with her Oscar for best director ChloÃ© Zhao has made history by becoming the first woman from an ethnic minority background- and only the second woman at all - to win the best director award at the Oscars. Chinese-born, British-educated, US-based Zhao also won best picture for Nomadland, her third feature film. All three have been quietly compelling portraits of people, often played by non-professional actors, in the margins of society in the American West. But her next film will be a departure - aMarvel comic blockbuster, Eternals,external. Frances McDormand and ChloÃ© Zhao on the set of Nomadland With her Oscar triumph, which comes 11 years after Kathryn Bigelow became the first woman to win best director for The Hurt Locker, 39-year-old Zhao has been recognised as one of the most distinctive and talented film-makers to emerge in recent years. Born in Beijing, her father was a successful steel executive and her step-mother is the well-known Chinese comedy actress Song Dandan. In her best director acceptance speech on Sunday, Zhao said: ""I've been thinking a lot lately of how I keep going when things get hard. I think it goes back to something I learned when I was a kid. ""When I was growing up in China, my Dad and I used to play this game. We would memorise classic Chinese poems and texts, and we would recite them together and try to finish each other's sentences. Chloe Zhao took Nomadland's Charlene Swankie to the Oscars ""There's one that I remember so dearly, it's called the Three Character Classics. The first phrase goes... 'People at birth are inherently good.' Those six letters had such a great impact on me when I was a kid, and I still truly believe them today. ""Even though sometimes it might seem like the opposite is true, I have always found goodness in the people I met, everywhere I went in the world. ""So this is for anyone who had the faith, and the courage to hold on to the goodness in themselves, and to hold on to the goodness in each other, no matter how difficult is to do that. ""And this is for you. You inspire me to keep going."" Nomadland, Hopkins and Kaluuya share Oscars glory The Oscars as they happened The winners and nominations in full She has had a tricky relationship with her home country, especially since a 2013 interview resurfaced in which she said there were ""lies everywhere"" when she was growing up. ""A lot of info I received when I was younger was not true, and I became very rebellious toward my family and my background,"" she said. Chinese authorities reportedly reacted by censoring marketing and mentions of Nomadland on social media, with questions raised about the film's release in the country. However, there was praise on Monday - after her win was announced - with users on Chinese microblogging platform Weibo calling her ""the light of China"" after her speech referenced her Chinese heritage. One person commented that her speech appeared to have deeper political meaning, adding that ""no smart person would think of abandoning the Chinese market"". But other users noted how ""strange"" it was that neither her name or the Oscars made it to the top trending search list on Weibo. In China, the Oscars are reportedly not being broadcast due to the controversies surrounding Zhao, as well as the documentary short Do Not Split, about the Hong Kong pro-democracy movement. Zhao moved to England to study in Brighton at the age of 14 in the mid-1990s, despite speaking little English. ""What I remember most about her was that she loved a challenge, in a good way,"" Alison Withers, a former teacher at Brighton College, a boarding school, told BBC South East Today. ""She came to a different country, a different culture, was always questioning why we did things, and just was willing to get stuck in. She was clearly very bright and picked up English terribly quickly."" She met her British partner and cinematographer Joshua James Richards while studying in New York Zhao herself has fondly remembered her time ""being very emo"" on Brighton beach. ""A lot of teenage angst, but those were some creative years,""she told the i newspaper,external. After Brighton, she went to the US and studied political science in Massachusetts before moving to New York in 2010 to enrol in NYU's Tisch School of the Arts' graduate film programme, whose artistic director is Spike Lee. It was a pivotal time for Zhao. She started working on her first feature film, Songs My Brothers Taught Me, a slow-burning coming-of-age story shot on a Native American reservation in South Dakota, shot using non-professional actors. Zhao with Brady and Tim Jandreau, who starred in her 2017 film The Rider While at NYU, she also embarked on a partnership - professional and personal - with fellow grad student Joshua James Richards, from Penzance, Cornwall, who has worked as cinematographer on all three of Zhao's films. ""There was a bond formed just through our taste and visually what we were drawn to,""he told IndieWire,external. Richards was nominated for an Oscar of his own for best cinematography for Nomadland. While working on Songs My Brothers Taught Me, Zhao met a rodeo rider called Brady Jandreau, and decided to construct her next film around him. The Rider, which came out in 2017 (and listed Zhao's father as an executive producer), followed a young man called Brady coming to terms with the aftermath of a bad rodeo accident, mirroring the real Brady's own story. It was named the year's best film by the US National Society of Film Critics and BBC Radio 4's Film Programme. The Rider refined what have become Zhao and Richards' hallmarks - casting non-actors to deliver compassionate, deeply moving personal drama in a form of fictionalised reality, often shot in wide open spaces bathed in golden sunlight.

""So I'm naturally drawn towards other people who live on the periphery, or don't live mainstream lifestyles.""

Fern finds a new life on the road - and a new community among her fellow nomadic van-dwellers - after the death of her husband and the decline of both the company where she worked and the town she called home. It has been an Oscars frontrunnersince September, when it became the first movie to win the top prizes at both the Toronto and Venice film festivals.

"Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been sentenced to a further year in prison and a one-year travel ban after being found guilty of propaganda against the Iranian government. Her lawyer saidshe was accused of taking part in a protest in London 12 years agoand speaking to the BBC Persian service. The prime minister said the UK would ""redouble"" efforts to free her. The British-Iranian charity worker was first jailed in Tehran in 2016. She has always denied the spying charges levelled against her. Confirming the latest sentence, her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, said the court's decision was a bad sign and ""clearly a negotiating tactic"" by the Iranian authorities - who are in the middle of discussions over the country's nuclear activities. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe appears in Iran court Who is Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe? 'My wife has been used as a bargaining chip' Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe has not been taken to prison yet, her husband said, and plans to appeal against the sentence. ""The threat is there, and the threat is bigger than we were fearing."" Mr Ratcliffe told the BBC. Referring to the possibility of being separated from his wife until summer 2023, he said: ""I think the worst case got a bit closer."" Mr Ratcliffe has not seen his wife in person since her imprisonment in 2016. Their daughter, Gabriella, who was with her mother in Tehran when she was arrested, has been with him in the UK since 2019. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""I don't think it is right at all that Nazanin should be sentenced to any more time in jail."" He said it was ""wrong that she is there in the first place"" and pledged to work hard to secure her release so she could return to her family, ""just as we work for all our dual national cases in Iran"". ""The government will not stop, we will redouble our efforts, and we are working with our American friends on this issue as well,"" Mr Johnson said. Mr Ratcliffe maintains his wife was imprisoned as leverage for a debt owed by the UK over its failure to deliver tanks to Iran in 1979. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's daughter Gabriella, now six, had counted down the days to her mother's release He says the case may also be caught up in negotiations over the international agreement to limit Iran's enrichment of nuclear material, whichthe UK and others are trying to revive. The sentencing may mean that part of the Iranian regime is unhappy with the direction of the negotiations taking place in Vienna and is signalling that things can get worse for Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe andother jailed dual nationals, Mr Ratcliffe said Last year, Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was moved from prison due to the coronavirus crisis and held under house arrest in Tehran until March, when her ankle tag was removed. But she returned to court later that month to face the latest propaganda charges. by Caroline Hawley, BBC diplomatic correspondent The new sentence is a bitter blow to Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and her family, who have campaigned relentlessly to get her home for five years. Mr Ratcliffe says the sentence is worse than he'd expected - but that a guilty verdict was guaranteed. He has consistently said that she's being held as a hostage on trumped-up charges - and fears that she will only be freed if Iran gets something in exchange. In this, the Iranian regime certainly has form. Last November, it released the British-Australian academic Kylie Moore Gilbert, who'd been sentenced to 10 years for spying. That was in exchange for three Iranian prisoners in Thailand - two of whom had been convicted over a bomb plot. And back in early 2016, when Iran's nuclear agreement came into force, Iran freed an American journalist, Jason Rezaian, in a prisoner swap. It's no coincidence, Mr Ratcliffe believes, that this verdict has come just as negotiations are taking place to revive the deal. Labour MP Tulip Siddiq, who represents the family's north London constituency, said they had been ""hoping and praying"" she would soon be free but instead she was ""being abusively used as a bargaining chip"". Ms Siddiq said the UK government's behind-the-scenes efforts to secure her release had ""clearly failed"", saying, ""We deserve an urgent explanation from ministers about what has happened."" Former foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt said, ""Iran's cruelty seems to know no bounds,"" but he questioned why the UK had not simply settled the tank debt, given it accepted it owed the money. Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesperson Layla Moran called for the government to impose targeted sanctions against the officials responsible in Iran. A medical evaluation carried out for the human rights charity Redress recently foundMrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and obsessive stress disorder due to ""traumatising experiences in the prisons of Iran"" and the uncertainty about her fate. This video can not be played Richard Ratcliffe: ""I think it was worse than I was expecting"" She told doctors that, during solitary confinement at the beginning of her sentence in 2016, she was interrogated - often while blindfolded - for eight to nine hours a day. Redress director Rupert Skilbeck said a further sentence could cause ""irreparable damage to her health"" after the ""torture and ill-treatment"" she had already been subjected to. ""Nazanin has never received a fair trial in Iran and is innocent of the allegations made against her. Her detention has always been illegal under international law,"" he said. ""The case must be dismissed and she should be allowed to return to her husband and daughter in the UK immediately."" Amnesty International UK's director, Kate Allen, said Mrs Zagari-Ratcliffe had twice had to face a ""sham trial"" in Iran. ""We fear that going back to jail will be almost too much for Nazanin to bear,"" she said. UNCONVENTIONAL WAYS TO EARN A LIVING:Stream Young, Welsh and Bossin' It now OH!

"Google design Google Argentina's domain name was bought by a web designer while the site was out of action for two hours in the country last Wednesday. Nicolas Kurona, aged 30, said he managed to buy Google.com.ar through a normal, legal process. ""I never imagined that it was going to allow me to buy it,"" he told the BBC. Google Argentina told the BBC: ""For a short term, the domain was acquired by someone else."" It added it had regained control of the domain very quickly. The story started when Nicolas was at his desk on the outskirts of Buenos Aires on Wednesday night, designing a website for a client. He started getting messages on WhatsApp that Google was down. ""I entered www.google.com.ar into my browser and it didn't work,"" he said.  ""I thought something strange was happening."" He decided to go on to the Network Information Center Argentina (NIC) - the organisation responsible for operating the .ar country code domains. He searched for Google - and up popped Argentina's Google domain available for purchase. Nicolas Kurona Despite thinking it would not work, he ""followed the steps and then I received an email with the purchase invoice"", he said. Nicolas shared the NIC invoice with the BBC. Google Argentina's domain name was acquired for 270 pesos (Â£2.08/$2.90). Dumbfounded, he tapped www.google.com.ar into his search bar and pressed enter. ""My personal data appeared,"" he said. ""I was frozen looking at the screen. I could not believe what had just happened."" At 21.52 local time on Wednesday, Nicolas bought Google Argentina's domain name.

Screengrab of NIC page, allowing Nicolas to buy www.google.com.ar ""I want to make it clear that I never had any bad intentions, I just tried to buy it and the NIC allowed me to,"" he said. Nicolas's night had, in just a few minutes, turned into a major news story. ""When the purchase process was completed and my data appeared, I knew that something was going to happen... I was really anxious,"" he said. Nicolas tweeted what had happened - to try to clarify how events had gone down, he said. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Britain is set for a ""sharp snap back"" in spending by shoppers as restrictions ease, according to experts at Deloitte. The firm found ""going to a shop"" topped the list of leisure activities people are most likely to do after lockdown. Separate research suggested that the UK's economy will grow at its fastest rate on record this year, helped by the rebound in consumer spending. The EY Item Club said the economy had ""proven to be more resilient than seemed possible"". The forecasting body has upgraded its 2021 growth forecast from 5% to 6.8%, which would mark the fastest rate seen since Office for National Statistics (ONS) records began. The UK's GDP, which measures all the activity of companies, governments and individuals in the economy, shrank by a record 9.9% last year as coronavirus restrictions hit output,according to the ONS.,external But EY expects that the UK economy will return to its pre-pandemic size in the second quarter of 2022 - three months earlier than previously forecast. Deloitte's research also suggested that the UK could be on track for a faster economic rebound than previously thought. Consumer confidence increased at the fastest rate in a decade in the first three months of 2021, according to its survey of 3,000 adults between 19 and 22 March. The survey found that six out of 10 people said they planned to return to the shops within a month of restrictions lifting. Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, said: ""The UK is primed for a sharp snap back in consumer activity. ""High levels of saving, the successful vaccination rollout and the easing of the lockdown set the stage for a surge in spending over the coming months."" Clothes sales boosted UK retailers ahead of reopening House sales and prices see early spring surge What is GDP and how is it measured? The economists at EY's Item Club also revised down their unemployment forecasts. The rate is now expected to reach 5.8% towards the end of this year, down from the 7% predicted in January. EY's chief economic adviser, Howard Archer, said that the latest forecast suggested the economy would ""emerge from the pandemic with much less long-term 'scarring' than was originally envisaged and looks set for a strong recovery over the rest of the year and beyond"". He added : ""While restrictions have caused disruption, lessons learned over the last 12 months have helped minimise the economic impact.""

Shops in Scotlandwill be allowed to reopen fully from Monday, whileNorthern Irelandis due to see non-essential retail reopen on 30 April. Separate research published last Friday suggested that the recent easing of lockdown measures had triggered a surge in activity among UK firms. A closely watched survey, produced by IHS Markit/CIPS, indicated that the looser restrictions had led to the fastest UK private sector growth since late 2013. The IHS Markit/CIPS Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 60 in April, according to initial findings, up from 56.4 in March. Any figure above 50 indicates expansion. The service sector grew faster than manufacturing for the first time since the Covid crisis began, the survey found, largely down to the reopening of non-essential shops seen in April.

"A number of emergency contracts were awarded in the height of the pandemic to cover PPE and other items Labour is calling for ministers to publish all contacts and links they have with firms awarded government contracts during the Covid crisis. In March 2020, emergency measures let the government speed up buying things like PPE and ventilators by directly awarding contracts rather than tenders. But since then, ministers have faced accusations of offering a ""VIP fast-track"" to the contracts for friends. The government said ""due diligence is carried out on every contract"". The call comes as a lobbying row continues to surround Westminster, following revelations thatformer prime minister David Cameron texted ministerson behalf of a firm he worked for - Greensill Capital - during the crisis. Last week, the BBC also revealed thatbusinessman Sir James Dyson directly texted Boris Johnsonabout tax issues during the pandemic, which the PM then said he would ""fix"". What is going on with government Covid contracts? VIP fast-track for PPE contracts back in court What is lobbying? A brief guide In the months following coronavirus hitting the UK in 2020, the government awarded thousands of contracts to private companies, spending billions of pounds of public money in the process. They covered everything from masks, gowns and gloves, to services such as researching public opinion about the government's Covid measures. But rather than going through the usual competitive tendering process for such contracts - which can take months or even years - the government was allowed to go directly to a preferred supplier without any competition, speeding up the process. Since then, questions have arisen over the decisions made by government, with accusations from Labour of ""cronyism"" andinvestigations by the BBC and others showing links between some of the firms and Whitehall. A case is also going through the High Court- brought forward by the Good Law Project - arguing that several of these deals were handled as part of a so-called VIP lane, reserved for leads endorsed by government officials or politicians. A Downing Street spokesperson said: ""We have been dealing with an unprecedented global pandemic and our approach throughout has been to act quickly to save lives, and we make no apology for that."" While the government had to award contracts at speed, ""due diligence is carried out on every contract"" and ""ministers have no role in awarding them"", the spokesman said. Number 10 said it is committed to transparency in procurement and notices of contracts awarded are published online. Labour is now calling for all ministers to publish any communications they had with their business contacts or links who were awarded contracts over the pandemic under the emergency rules - as well as details of any firms who were part of the ""VIP fast track"". Shadow Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Rachel Reeves, has written to her government counterpart, Michael Gove, saying there is ""a growing impression that there is one set of rules for ministers and their close friends, and another for the rest of the British public"". As well as details on ministers and their contacts, she asked Mr Gove when the prime minister would share his own messages with Mr Dyson and other business leaders -which he pledged to do last week- and when a new independent advisor for ministerial standards would be appointed,following the resignation of Sir Alex Allan in November 2020. In a statement, Ms Reeves added that there was an ""increasing spread of Tory sleaze"" creating ""increasingly serious questions for government"". Why have Covid contracts been challenged?

"The pandemic has led to the biggest annual fall in employment for older workers since the 1980s, according to a new report. The decline in the employment rate for the over-50s has been twice as big as for those aged between 25 and 49. The Resolution Foundation also found that after losing work, older workers take the longest to return. It called on the government to tailor retraining opportunities to over-50s. The report suggests that the Covid-19 crisis has created a ""U-shaped"" employment shock, with older and younger workers affected more than those who are middle-aged. Although workers aged under 25 have seen by far the largest fall in employment in the past year, the fall in employment among those aged over 50 has been twice as big as those aged between 25 and 49, a 1.4 percentage point declined compared to 0.7 percentage point dip. Latest stats from the ONS show there were 109,000 more unemployed workers aged 50-64 between December and February 2021 than the same period a year before, the Resolution Foundation says. The Resolution Foundation found that fewer than two in three managed to find return to work within six months. And when older workers do return to the workplace, they face the highest income hit of all age groups, it said. Typical hourly earnings fell by 9.5%, compared with what they were earning before being made unemployed. Kathleen Henehan, senior policy analyst at the Resolution Foundation, told the BBC: ""One of the more worrying things about losing your job when you're older is that on average, it takes a lot longer to find a job. ""A lot of that will be down to the fact you have more skills and experience, as well as more financial commitments you need to meet. ""When [older workers] do find that job - it tends to pay a lot less than the previous job... with big implications for retirement savings and how long they may need to work."" ""Initially when we opened years ago, it was an incredibly successful store, with huge turnover and the footfall was great. It was a really exciting time to be in retail,"" says Mandy Reynolds. The 51-year-old from Stoke-on-Trent was a store manager at one of Arcadia's Outfit stores, before the group collapsed into administration. Mandy Reynolds was a store manager at one of Arcadia's Outfit stores, before the group collapsed into administration ""It became more obvious, as there was a switch to online shopping, the struggles that the business was up against. ""When we went into administration at the end of the last lockdown in November, we were under the impression we would continue to trade."" But Mandy lost her job in February after 13 years with the group. Having worked in retail for a long time, she was confident in her experience and skills - but has found the job market tough to crack. ""The job market was a bit stagnant because of lockdown, but there are a lot of jobs out there and I'm really struggling to find one. ""I feel the experience and knowledge [older workers] have can be transitioned to a different role, but it's trying to convince other industries and people that that is the case on a piece of paper. ""The opportunities that are out there are plenty - it's just finding a way in and that's what's difficult."" She has applied for at least 30 jobs, on top of learning new online interview skills and updating her CV. But the mother-of-four is feeling optimistic: ""This has given me an amazing opportunity to stand back and consider what I have to offer, what I'd like to do... maybe stretch myself a bit and look for work that would be satisfying in a different way. ""I've still got more to do."" Nye Cominetti, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation, added: ""In the face of the current crisis, unemployed older workers may have to either work for longer to make up for these negative employment effects, or retire earlier than they planned to. ""The government must ensure that older workers are not forgotten in the design and implementation of schemes created in the wake of the crisis to help people back into work."" Alex Beer, head of the welfare programme at the Nuffield Foundation, which supported the report, also urged the government to offer tailored support to older workers, such as opportunities to retrain or extra support to find new jobs. A spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions said: ""Older workers are a huge asset to this country, and heading into the pandemic a record number of over 50s were in work. ""As we build back better we're helping hundreds of thousands of older workers to retrain, build new skills and get back into work through our Plan for Jobs and our 50 Plus: Choices Offer.""

"Boris Johnson lives in Downing Street with his fiancee Carrie Symonds The UK's top civil servant says Boris Johnson has asked him to review how the refurbishment of his Downing Street flat was paid for. Cabinet Secretary Simon Case was responding to MPs' questions about how the work was funded. The row escalated after Mr Johnson's ex-adviser Dominic Cummings claimed the PM once planned to have donors ""secretly pay"" for the revamp. The PM has said any relevant donations will be declared ""in due course"". Labour has called on the Electoral Commission, which regulates political donations in the UK, to launch a formal investigation. The watchdog has said it is talking to the Conservative Party about whether the spending on the flat falls within its remit. PM's flat refurbishment: What is the row about? Johnson's 'bodies pile high' comments prompt criticism Five questions for the PM and why the answers matter Appearing before a Commons committeeon Monday, Mr Case said a review into the refurbishment would look at ""how this has been done"". Asked repeatedly whether he was aware if private donations covered any of the costs, he said he had ""not been involved directly in this"". ""I do not have all of the facts and details at my disposal,"" he said, adding that his review would probably take ""a matter of weeks"". Another day, another denial.  Another 24 hours when rather than making their arguments, the government is embroiled in arguments about the past. Whether it's the prime minister's alleged frustrations about lockdown, attacks from his former adviser Dominic Cummings, or the mystery over his expensive flat renovation, as one senior Tory put it, it matters, because it all relates to Boris Johnson's judgement. Many Conservatives have been confident however that the prime minister's reputation, his enjoyment for pushing convention, is something that many voters are even attracted to. But there's a risk that confidence could turn to complacency. There is a belief in the Labour Party that the unhappy mess is starting to be noticed by voters. And no one knows when, or what might next emerge. One cabinet minister told me ""there's nothing we can do to control it."" The claims about the flat are contained in a blog posted by Mr Cummings on Friday, his first since leaving his role in No 10. In the blog, Mr Cummingsalso deniedhe was behind the leaking of details of November's second coronavirus lockdown in England. Mr Case told MPs that an internal inquiry into that leak was ongoing, but it was ""probable"" officials working on it would fail to identify any sources. Meanwhile, Mr Johnson has denied reports he said he would rather ""let the bodies pile high in their thousands"" than order a third lockdown. TheDaily Mail reported,externalthe prime minister made the remarks during heated conversations within government in the autumn over lockdown restrictions. Sources familiar with the conversationhave told the BBCMr Johnson suggested he would rather see ""bodies pile high"" during the discussions. This video can not be played Simon Case was asked whether private donations funded work at the flat Like several of his recent predecessors, the PM is living in the flat above No 11 Downing Street, which is larger than the one above No 10. Speaking earlier, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said the prime minister had paid for the revamp ""from his own money"" . He said this came ""on top of"" public money from the annual Â£30,000 taxpayer grant available to all prime ministers for the upkeep of their accommodation. In awritten statement on Friday,external, the government said no money from this grant was spent in the 2019/20 financial year. Figures for this year are expected to be published in the summer. ""At all times the prime minister has complied with the rules. He's paid for it out of his own money, "" he said. Michelle Obama visited Samantha Cameron in the 11 Downing St flat back in 2011 Speaking to reporters on Monday, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer urged a ""full and transparent investigation"" into the allegations about the Downing Street flat, arguing they risked undermining trust in government. ""It's all very well the prime minister saying now 'I paid for it', the critical question was: what was the original arrangement - and why is it so complicated?"" ""If there's a straightforward answer, well give it. And if there isn't, then there are very serious questions to be asked,"" he added. A No 10 spokesperson said: ""At all times, the government and ministers have acted in accordance with the appropriate codes of conduct and electoral law."" Donations and loans to political parties of more than Â£7,500 must be reported to the Electoral Commission. The Conservative Party has previously said that all ""reportable donations"" are ""correctly declared to the Electoral Commission, published by them and comply fully with the law"". The party said ""gifts and benefits received in a ministerial capacity"" are declared in government transparency returns. Mr Case was also asked by MPs about the case of businessman Lex Greensill who was a part-time unpaid government adviser in David Cameron's government. The civil servant boss said that situation was not ""acceptable"" and that it ""looks like there were conflicts"". He added that he didn't think there was anything of that equivalent happening in the civil service now. The prime minister has already appointed the lawyer Nigel Boardman to hold a review into all the issues surrounding Greensill Capital. What is the David Cameron lobbying row about?

"Catalytic converter thefts have surged in lockdown amid a spike in the value of precious metals, research shows. The RAC and insurer Ageas found the crime now accounts for three-in-10 thefts from private vehicles in the UK, up from two-in-10 before the pandemic. Catalytic converters contain metals such as platinum and rhodium which fetch high prices on the black market. When values of these metals go up it usually leads to a spate of thefts, the RAC and Ageas said. They pointed out that prices of rhodium hit record highs earlier this year, having climbed more than 200% since March 2020. The research compared thefts during the first three months of the year, compared with the period between October and December 2019. RAC spokesman Simon Williams said: ""Drivers are often oblivious of their vehicle's catalytic converter being stolen. Our patrols are often called to attend cars that have suddenly become excessively noisy. ""On investigation it's very often the case that the car's catalytic converter has been stolen."" Lockdown surge in catalytic converter thefts Reality Check: Thefts of catalytic converters According to the research, most thefts happen while cars are parked at home, either on the driveway or the road. But converters have occasionally been stolen in supermarket car parks while the driver is shopping, the research said. Mr Williams recommended motorists take extra precautions, parking their vehicle in well-lit residential locations, or ideally a garage. ""When away from home, look for car parks that have security patrols and are covered by CCTV,"" he said. Because thieves slide under the car to get at the catalytic converters, parking against a wall can also help. Catalytic converters form part of a car's exhaust system. They contain a honeycomb coated with precious metals such as platinum, palladium and rhodium which help to reduce and filter harmful gases from the vehicles' exhaust systems. While converters are just one component of a car, their theft can often result in a driver's car being written off.

Michaela, who has spinal muscular atrophy, has said people should remember people who are shielding as lockdown restrictions ease. The condition puts her at very high risk if she were to get Covid. Michaela has gone from being very active to hardly leaving the house in over 400 days. She told BBC Radio 5 Live's Stephen Nolan: ""I think people donât understand that itâs their behaviourâ¦ which drives up community transmission."" Although she has had both vaccines, Michaela plans to keep shielding until cases have gone down further. Listen to 5 Live on the free BBC Sounds app. The Spanish city of Pamplona has cancelled the famous bull
running festival for the second year in a row. The San Fermin festival, which also features singing,
dancing and drinking, was due to be held in July. Mayor Enrique Maya made
the announcement in a news conference, telling reporters that the event would
be âvery high riskâ as the number of people vaccinated is still too low. Last yearâs cancellation
was the first in more than 40 years. More details now on news that the European Union has launched legal action against vaccine
manufacturer AstraZeneca. The European Commission â the EUâs executive branch â said it
was suing the company for not respecting its vaccine supply contract, and for
not having a âreliableâ plan to ensure timely deliveries. AstraZeneca said the move was âwithout meritâ and said it
would âstrongly defend itself in courtâ. The EU is struggling with the slow pace of its vaccine
rollout. A deal last August between the EU and AstraZeneca foresaw 300 million
doses for the bloc. However earlier this year AstraZeneca said its supplies
would be reduced due to production issues. Read

Gove denies the PM made any such comment. Labour MP Wes Street says: ""Can I ask him again to be absolutely categorical that he has
never heard the prime minister say those words?"" Gove says: ""I never heard the
prime minister say any such thing."" Plaid Cymru MP Hywel Williams asks: ""Is he confident that [the PM's] answer today is sufficiently comprehensive and sufficiently robust to lay these matters to rest?"" Gove replies: ""Yes"". Labour MP, Rachel Reeves, says the prime minister ""would rather that the bodies piled high than act on scientific advice"". She asks Gove to apologise for the ""the stomach-churning comments that have come out today."" Gove says Reeves suggestion that the government did not act on scientific advice is ""completely wrong"". He says: ""This government has initiated not just a second but a third lockdown in response to medical and scientific advice"" and ""ensured that we have had the fastest vaccine rollout in Europe"". He says: ""The ventilators that this government played a part in procuring are now saving lives in India."" Liberal Democrat Vera Hobhouse asks if the best way forward would be an independent public inquiry into the government's handling of the pandemic in ""order to get all the facts right"". Gove says: ""There will be a time for an independent public inquiry, and there will be lessons to be learnt, mistakes have been made.""

Vaccine production needs highly specialised raw materials The US is making available crucial raw materials needed for

spread the infection of Covid-19 within Sweden in order to achieve herd
immunity? âNever, never ever,â was the answer given by the Swedish Prime
Minister Stefan LÃ¶fven today. He was facing questions from Swedenâs Committee on the Constitution, which has the job of
scrutinising the country's government and ministers and has been questioning a
range of high-profile officials and politicians in recent weeks. Last year Swedenâs Public Health Agency did suggest that by
leaving more of society open, higher levels of immunity would be a beneficial
side effect. But the government has repeatedly stressed that its initial
approach was to adopt measures designed to work in the longer term, rather than
going in and out of lockdown. LÃ¶fven told the committee that there was a clear
goal to limit the spread of infection and protect the most vulnerable. But the Swedish PM admitted that although his ministers had
agreed on a general approach to handling the pandemic, the government never
formalised or voted on a Covid-19 strategy. Sweden is currently experiencing a third wave of infection.
Almost 14,000 people have died since the start of the pandemic, and close to 1
million people have tested positive for Covid-19, in a country of just 10
million. Six people were reported on Monday to have died with coronavirus within 28 days of a positive test and there were 2,064 new cases, according to government figures. European countries have restricted non-essential travel from the US for more than a year Americans may be able to travel to the EU this summer if
they are fully vaccinated against coronavirus. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told the
New York Times this should be possible as both sides have approved the same jabs. However she did not give an exact timetable and said it
would depend on the âepidemiological situationâ. European countries have restricted non-essential travel from
the US for more than a year. The US still bans leisure travel from the EU and UK. There
have been some suggestions it could reciprocate in lifting restrictions but
nothing has yet been announced. The UK, which is now outside of the EU, is introducing a
traffic light system on 17 May that will set out its travel restrictions on
countries around the world. Read more here Nick BeakeBrussels Corrspondent Italy has relaxed restrictions on restaurants, coffee bars and cinemas Some of Romeâs most picturesque

Mary Clare and Brianna were enjoying lunch outside for the first time in more
than six weeks â a moment that tasted even better as theyâd just finished an

was trying his best to coax any passers-by onto the terrace, said heâs been
encouraged by news that vaccinated American tourists would be welcomed to the
EU this summer. But theyâre not here yet and this is a country where many Covid
rules remain in place, including the 10pm curfew (for at least another month,
it seems) and the wearing of masks in public places. Christian, a dad of two who works in an hotel which has been hit hard by the lack of visitors, told us todayâs openings were âa sign that better days were on the wayâ. The famous marbled figures

The dogs were found malnourished and dehydrated while being transported in a van from Cheltenham to Stoke-on-Trent, in England. Patrick Stokes, 24, who lives on a traveller site in Durham, was driving the unventilated vehicle and told police he ""wasn't selling the puppies"". Appearing at Cheltenham Magistrates' Court he admitted failing to ensure the welfare of animals in his care. Mr Stokes was found to have 44 puppies and two dogs. They were later tested for canine coronavirus and 20 results came back positive. Prosecutor Cathy Thornton said the infected puppies died in the following weeks, many by euthanasia. Read more.

National Health Commission says that 224.9 millionvaccine

Alan Thompson had played bowls for 30 years but played his last game just a day before he had a stroke in 2018 The easing of restrictions in Wales from today means Alan Thompson, 74, will be able to step back on the bowling green for the first time in over three years after recovering from a stroke. While playing was banned, Alan, from Llantrisant, had been taking part in virtual games hosted by Sport Wales.

Michaela, who has spinal muscular atrophy, has said people should remember people who are shielding as lockdown restrictions ease. The condition puts her at very high risk if she were to get Covid. Michaela has gone from being very active to hardly leaving the house in over 400 days. She told BBC Radio 5 Live's Stephen Nolan: ""I think people donât understand that itâs their behaviourâ¦ which drives up community transmission."" Although she has had both vaccines, Michaela plans to keep shielding until cases have gone down further.

running festival for the second year in a row. The San Fermin festival, which also features singing,
dancing and drinking, was due to be held in July. Mayor Enrique Maya made
the announcement in a news conference, telling reporters that the event would
be âvery high riskâ as the number of people vaccinated is still too low. Last yearâs cancellation
was the first in more than 40 years. More details now on news that the European Union has launched legal action against vaccine
manufacturer AstraZeneca. The European Commission â the EUâs executive branch â said it
was suing the company for not respecting its vaccine supply contract, and for
not having a âreliableâ plan to ensure timely deliveries. AstraZeneca said the move was âwithout meritâ and said it
would âstrongly defend itself in courtâ. The EU is struggling with the slow pace of its vaccine
rollout. A deal last August between the EU and AstraZeneca foresaw 300 million
doses for the bloc. However earlier this year AstraZeneca said its supplies
would be reduced due to production issues. Read

Gove denies the PM made any such comment. Labour MP Wes Street says: ""Can I ask him again to be absolutely categorical that he has
never heard the prime minister say those words?"" Gove says: ""I never heard the
prime minister say any such thing."" Plaid Cymru MP Hywel Williams asks: ""Is he confident that [the PM's] answer today is sufficiently comprehensive and sufficiently robust to lay these matters to rest?"" Gove replies: ""Yes"". Labour MP, Rachel Reeves, says the prime minister ""would rather that the bodies piled high than act on scientific advice"". She asks Gove to apologise for the ""the stomach-churning comments that have come out today."" Gove says Reeves suggestion that the government did not act on scientific advice is ""completely wrong"". He says: ""This government has initiated not just a second but a third lockdown in response to medical and scientific advice"" and ""ensured that we have had the fastest vaccine rollout in Europe"". He says: ""The ventilators that this government played a part in procuring are now saving lives in India."" Liberal Democrat Vera Hobhouse asks if the best way forward would be an independent public inquiry into the government's handling of the pandemic in ""order to get all the facts right"". Gove says: ""There will be a time for an independent public inquiry, and there will be lessons to be learnt, mistakes have been made."" Linda and Pat have been enjoying drinks in Bargoed, Caerphilly People in Wales have been making the most of the sunshine and the opening of pubs outdoors after rules were relaxed. Up to six people from six households are able to meet outdoors. Friends Linda Trollope and Pat Cooper have been enjoying a gin on the terrace of Murray's Sports Bar in Bargoed, Caerphilly county.

""I wish I wore a t-shirt, instead of my winter jumper. We're celebrating in style,"" added Ms Cooper. Vaccine production needs highly specialised raw materials The US is making available crucial raw materials needed for
vaccine production in India, which is battling surging coronavirus cases. Less than 10% of Indiaâs population has so far received an initial

"ChloÃ© Zhao with her Oscar for best director ChloÃ© Zhao has made history by becoming the first woman from an ethnic minority background- and only the second woman at all - to win the best director award at the Oscars. Chinese-born, British-educated, US-based Zhao also won best picture for Nomadland, her third feature film. All three have been quietly compelling portraits of people, often played by non-professional actors, in the margins of society in the American West. But her next film will be a departure - aMarvel comic blockbuster, Eternals,external. Frances McDormand and ChloÃ© Zhao on the set of Nomadland With her Oscar triumph, which comes 11 years after Kathryn Bigelow became the first woman to win best director for The Hurt Locker, 39-year-old Zhao has been recognised as one of the most distinctive and talented film-makers to emerge in recent years. Born in Beijing, her father was a successful steel executive and her step-mother is the well-known Chinese comedy actress Song Dandan. In her best director acceptance speech on Sunday, Zhao said: ""I've been thinking a lot lately of how I keep going when things get hard. I think it goes back to something I learned when I was a kid. ""When I was growing up in China, my Dad and I used to play this game. We would memorise classic Chinese poems and texts, and we would recite them together and try to finish each other's sentences. Chloe Zhao took Nomadland's Charlene Swankie to the Oscars ""There's one that I remember so dearly, it's called the Three Character Classics. The first phrase goes... 'People at birth are inherently good.' Those six letters had such a great impact on me when I was a kid, and I still truly believe them today. ""Even though sometimes it might seem like the opposite is true, I have always found goodness in the people I met, everywhere I went in the world. ""So this is for anyone who had the faith, and the courage to hold on to the goodness in themselves, and to hold on to the goodness in each other, no matter how difficult is to do that. ""And this is for you. You inspire me to keep going."" Nomadland, Hopkins and Kaluuya share Oscars glory The Oscars as they happened The winners and nominations in full She has had a tricky relationship with her home country, especially since a 2013 interview resurfaced in which she said there were ""lies everywhere"" when she was growing up. ""A lot of info I received when I was younger was not true, and I became very rebellious toward my family and my background,"" she said. Chinese authorities reportedly reacted by censoring marketing and mentions of Nomadland on social media, with questions raised about the film's release in the country. However, there was praise on Monday - after her win was announced - with users on Chinese microblogging platform Weibo calling her ""the light of China"" after her speech referenced her Chinese heritage. One person commented that her speech appeared to have deeper political meaning, adding that ""no smart person would think of abandoning the Chinese market"". But other users noted how ""strange"" it was that neither her name or the Oscars made it to the top trending search list on Weibo. In China, the Oscars are reportedly not being broadcast due to the controversies surrounding Zhao, as well as the documentary short Do Not Split, about the Hong Kong pro-democracy movement. Zhao moved to England to study in Brighton at the age of 14 in the mid-1990s, despite speaking little English. ""What I remember most about her was that she loved a challenge, in a good way,"" Alison Withers, a former teacher at Brighton College, a boarding school, told BBC South East Today. ""She came to a different country, a different culture, was always questioning why we did things, and just was willing to get stuck in. She was clearly very bright and picked up English terribly quickly."" She met her British partner and cinematographer Joshua James Richards while studying in New York Zhao herself has fondly remembered her time ""being very emo"" on Brighton beach. ""A lot of teenage angst, but those were some creative years,""she told the i newspaper,external. After Brighton, she went to the US and studied political science in Massachusetts before moving to New York in 2010 to enrol in NYU's Tisch School of the Arts' graduate film programme, whose artistic director is Spike Lee. It was a pivotal time for Zhao. She started working on her first feature film, Songs My Brothers Taught Me, a slow-burning coming-of-age story shot on a Native American reservation in South Dakota, shot using non-professional actors. Zhao with Brady and Tim Jandreau, who starred in her 2017 film The Rider While at NYU, she also embarked on a partnership - professional and personal - with fellow grad student Joshua James Richards, from Penzance, Cornwall, who has worked as cinematographer on all three of Zhao's films. ""There was a bond formed just through our taste and visually what we were drawn to,""he told IndieWire,external. Richards was nominated for an Oscar of his own for best cinematography for Nomadland. While working on Songs My Brothers Taught Me, Zhao met a rodeo rider called Brady Jandreau, and decided to construct her next film around him. The Rider, which came out in 2017 (and listed Zhao's father as an executive producer), followed a young man called Brady coming to terms with the aftermath of a bad rodeo accident, mirroring the real Brady's own story. It was named the year's best film by the US National Society of Film Critics and BBC Radio 4's Film Programme. The Rider refined what have become Zhao and Richards' hallmarks - casting non-actors to deliver compassionate, deeply moving personal drama in a form of fictionalised reality, often shot in wide open spaces bathed in golden sunlight. Zhao recently told The Telegraph about the stories that appeal to her. ""Wherever I've gone in life, I've always felt like an outsider,""she said,external. ""So I'm naturally drawn towards other people who live on the periphery, or don't live mainstream lifestyles."" She was drawn to the stories of people whose homes are vans, and whose transient, unpredictable but often liberated lives on the road were documented in the 2017 non-fiction book Nomadland: Surviving America in the Twenty-First Century by Jessica Bruder. This video can not be played Meet the Americans nomads whose lives on the road inspired the Oscar-nominated Nomadland Zhao got to know many of the people from the book, and cast some of them to play versions of themselves in the film of Nomadland alongside the lead character Fern, a fictional role played by Frances McDormand. Fern finds a new life on the road - and a new community among her fellow nomadic van-dwellers - after the death of her husband and the decline of both the company where she worked and the town she called home. It has been an Oscars frontrunnersince September, when it became the first movie to win the top prizes at both the Toronto and Venice film festivals. The film has had its share of controversy, however, with some criticising Zhao for glossing over some of the problems documented by Bruder about work in an Amazon warehouse, one of several temporary jobs that Fern and her friends find. Zhao with Nomadland cast members, Frances McDormand, Charlene Swankie and Linda May But that did not derail its award momentum or stop Zhao becoming one of Hollywood's most feted film-makers. She has already made the move into the world of blockbusters. She will use her distinctive vision and voice in Marvel's Eternals, about immortal superheroes played by Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek, Richard Madden and Kumail Nanjiani. She has been a fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe for a decade. ""I put the word out there I wanted to make a Marvel movie, and the right project came to me,"" she said. Eternals is due out in November. After that, she is reportedly scheduled to work on a ""futuristic, sci-fi Western"" take on Dracula. She has said building a rich, convincing world on film is her ""favourite thing"", whether that's the world of rodeo riders or comic book heroes. Speaking about her Marvel movieto Variety,external, she said she planned to ""put a spin on it while still being true to the essence of it"". ""That's exciting to me.

"This video can not be played Scottish election 2021: Sturgeon faces questions over 'hard border' Nicola Sturgeon says she wants to keep trade flowing across an England-Scotland border if an independent Scotland re-joined the European Union. Speaking on theBBC's Andrew Marr programme, the SNP leader accepted there would have to be a border if an independent Scotland was in the EU. But she said Scotland would try to negotiate arrangements to ""keep trade flowing freely"". Opponents say a hard border with England would be ""dreadful for trade"". The SNP want to hold a referendum on Scottish independence if they win a majority in the Scottish Parliament elections on 6 May. SIGN UP FOR SCOTLAND ALERTS:Get extra updates on BBC election coverage Ms Sturgeon was questioned on the practical details of an independent Scotland re-joining the EU. ""Of course we want to keep trade flowing across the England-Scotland border, that would be in the interests of Scotland as well and we would work to make sure that happened,"" she said. ""We will keep trade flowing freely, we will comply with all of the requirements of EU membership."" EU regulations set out that 30% of poultry, eggs, milk and fish, as well as 100% of live animals, need to be inspected when entering the single market. Asked how she would police such a border, Ms Sturgeon said: ""I am not denying what the EU regulations say. I am not denying because of the absurdity of Brexit that all sorts of issues are raised for Scotland completely against our democratic will. ""We would work as a country to make sure that for our businesses, there is no difficulties in terms of their day to day experiences in trading."" Ms Sturgeon was pressed further on whether she had modelled the impact of Scottish independence on people's incomes. She responded: ""If I was do to all of that modelling now we'd have to redo it when we were asking people to make that choice. I believe it's right to only ask people to make a choice of that magnitude on the basis of quality up to date information."" Scottish election 2021: Who should I vote for? How will pupils catch up on lost education? Final design for Inverness hydro scheme Orkney 'smart energy' grid project launched The Scottish Liberal Democrats treasury spokeswoman Christine Jardine said it was time the SNP ""came clean on whether they are planning tax rises or spending cuts"". ""This week has not only exposed the SNP as desperately confused over the economics of independence but revealed that they are contemplating a hard border with England,"" she added. ""This would not only be dreadful for trade but throw up barriers between friends and families."" Willie Rennie was on the campaign trail at a dry ski slope On the election campaign trail, the Liberal Democrats have been highlighting mental health support for police officers. Party leader Willie Rennie said the emergency services in Scotland were suffering a mental health crisis because they were working under a government that was ""distracted"". SCOTLAND'S ELECTION: THE BASICS What's happening?On 6 May, people across Scotland will vote to elect 129 Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs). The party that wins the most seats will form the government.Find out more here. What powers do they have?MSPs pass laws on aspects of life in Scotland such as health, education and transport - and have some powers over tax and welfare benefits. Scottish Labour it was ""reckless beyond imagining"" for the SNP to call for a referendum during the recovery from the pandemic, while economists warned Scotland was headed for a jobs crisis. Commenting on Ms Sturgeon's Andrew Marr interview, the party's Scotland spokesman Ian Murray said: ""Hearing the casual way with which Nicola Sturgeon dismisses those independent experts that she is so fond of quoting when they agree with her and her failure to answer any of the tough questions on separation - from effects on income to the border - is playing fast and loose with people's futures. ""Scotland deserves better than this. Scottish Labour is opposed to independence and a second referendum."" On the campaign trail in Fife, party leader Anas Sarwar said only Labour could hold the SNP to account and ensure that the next parliament was focused on the ""national recovery"". Anas Sarwar was on the campaign trail in Dunfermline Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said Ms Sturgeon's plans for a ""post-referendum border"" with England would be a ""hammer-blow"" for Scottish businesses. ""By Nicola Sturgeon's own admission, the SNP are clueless about the economic impact of independence. They've done no analysis on how many jobs it would put at risk or how much damage would be done to Scotland's economy,"" he said. ""She floundered and didn't have a single convincing answer to dispel the overwhelming evidence that separating Scotland from the rest of the UK would be devastating for jobs and businesses."" Meanwhile, the party has been campaigning on the need to protect Scottish jobs and the economy by reopening safely at a slightly faster pace. Lorna Slater, the Scottish Greens co-leader, has been litter-picking in a canal in Edinburgh The Scottish Greens have been focusing on ""pointless plastics"" in their campaign, with the party pledging to phase out single use ""non-essential"" plastics by 2025 in a move towards a ""circular economy"". Speaking ahead of a litter pick on a canal in Edinburgh, Scottish Greens co-leader Lorna Slater said: ""Plastic pollution is choking our planet, and we need to act. ""The Scottish Greens will deliver a dramatic reduction in the use of single use plastics where suitable alternatives are available.""
