"Khuram Butt (left) was known to police and the security service Two of the three men who carried out Saturday night's terror attack in London have been named by police. They said Pakistan-born Khuram Butt, 27, of Barking, London, had been known to police and MI5 but there had not been any intelligence about an attack. The other attacker was Rachid Redouane, 30, from Barking, who police said had claimed to be Moroccan-Libyan. The attackers were shot dead by police. All 12 people arrested after the attack have now been released without charge. The seven women and five men were arrested in Barking on Sunday following the attack in which seven people were killed and 48 injured. The attackers drove a hired van into pedestrians on London Bridge before stabbing people in the area around Borough Market. A vigil was held at Potters Field Park near London Bridge on Monday evening to remember the victims. NHS England said 36 people remained in hospital, with 18 in a critical condition. Latest updates In pictures: Tributes to victims Quiet but defiant mood at London Bridge How are UK extremists radicalised? Redouane, who was a chef, also used the name Rachid Elkhdar. He had not been known to police. Metropolitan Police assistant commissioner Mark Rowley said: ""Inquiries are ongoing to confirm the identity of their accomplice."" He said the investigation into Butt had begun two years ago but ""there was no intelligence to suggest that this attack was being planned and the investigation had been prioritised accordingly"". He added: ""Work is ongoing to understand more about them, their connections and whether they were assisted or supported by anyone else."" A vigil was held in Potters Field Park, close to London Bridge Butt featured in a Channel 4 documentary last year about Islamist extremists with links to the jailed preacher Anjem Choudary. The attacker, who had older siblings and was married with at least one child, could be seen in the programme arguing with police officers in the street. An online CV seen by the BBC shows that Butt had achieved an NVQ Level 2 in business administration. This video can not be played Khuram Butt was shown in a documentary about extremists He went on to work in an administrative role for a company called Auriga Holdings, based in East Ham, which manages Kentucky Fried Chicken outlets. He had also worked for London Underground for just under six months as a trainee customer services assistant, before leaving in October last year, Transport for London said. And Butt was the sole director of a now-dissolved company called Kool Kosmetics. (L to R) Badeiyah Islam, 14, Hanyah Casam, 14 and Zahra Salamut, 15 were among the crowd at Potters Field Park The vigil began as a sombre and quiet gathering under the trees in Potters Field Park, where people stood in quiet contemplation looking out over the Thames. So many spoke of their desire to stand together with others and show love. London Mayor Sadiq Khan's speech roused the quiet crowd of thousands into hearty applause when he spoke of his disgust and defiance over the horror of Saturday's events. After a minute's silence, many went forward to lay flowers beneath the flagpoles of City Hall. It was a dignified show of solidarity and strength in the face of fear and hate. Read more here. BBC home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani said two people in Barking had raised concerns about Butt. One man called the anti-terrorism hotline in 2015, while a woman went to the local police station because she was scared Butt was trying to radicalise her children. Security officials made him a lower priority than other targets because of a lack of information that he was involved in attack-planning, our correspondent said. Sources in Dublin said Redouane was understood to have been carrying an identification card issued in the Republic of Ireland when he was shot dead, the Press Association reported. Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny said he was not a member of a ""small group"" being monitored by Irish police in respect of radicalisation. Canadian national Chrissy Archibald, 30, was the first victim to be named. Herfamily said she had died in her fiancÃ©'s armsafter being struck by the attackers' speeding van. The sister of 32-year-old James McMullan, from Hackney, east London, said he was believed to be amongthose who died, after his bank card was found on a body at the scene. James McMullan is believed to have been killed in the attack, as well as Chrissy Archibald A French national was also killed in the attack, according to foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian.

Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor Asked about the scale of challenge facing the government, Laura Kuenssberg says: ""It's not a very tempting inbox. ""A lot of people are anxious - living standards, wages are sluggish, there are huge uncertainties around the world, whoever is in charge will have to watch the pennies carefully. ""Above all the other issues, how will they take us out of the EU? Whoever ends up in Number 10 will be the one negotiator up against 27 other countries. ""The deal they get - or don't get - will shape our future for decades."" Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg says: ""In many ways it does remind us of a kind of politics that went some time ago because the gulf between the two main parties - between Labour and the Tories  - is the biggest contrast we have seen for many years. ""It is a wide choice and we've seen people around the country responding to that. Whatever the result, in the last few elections we have seen a splintering of the control of the main two parties. ""But I suspect we will see the biggest share for the two main parties that we've seen for quite some time - a return for the two ""tribes"" is something that has developed over the last couple of weeks. ""There's a sense of something quite retro about this campaign even in this 21st Century volatility. ""Labour have had a better time than was expected. Watching both parties on the road today, the Tories appeared to have recovered some of their sheen of their early self-confidence."" Tim Farron goes on to tell the Oxford rally that if you vote for Theresa May she will assume ""you meant you are OK with the dementia tax, with schools sacking teachers, with cripplingly low police numbers"". He says: ""If you are someone who has traditionally voted Conservative and you're not OK with that, vote Lib Dem.

Mr Corbyn returns to his message that politics is about a choice - to re-elect a Tory government which will continue austerity and continue the tax relief and giveaways to the richest in our society. The Labour government will do things very differently, he says, repeating a pledge that 95% will pay no more in taxes and 5% will be asked to pay a little bit more. Voting Labour tomorrow is voting to look at things the other way round, he continues. For the interests of all of the people, not the very few, he adds, almost drowned out by cheering supporters.

"Police say the death toll from Saturday's attacks has risen to eight Australian au pair Sara Zelenak is named as the latest victim of the attacks Police searching for French national Xavier Thomas have recovered a body from the Thames A 30-year-old man was arrested for terrorism offences in the early hours of Wednesday Police casualty bureau can be contacted on 0800 096 1233 and 020 7158 0197 How the events unfolded at London Bridge two years ago and who was caught up in the terror attack. Sara Zelenak was a 'beautiful daughter' her family says, as all eight killed in the attack are named. Fundraisers are urging people to take to the capital's restaurants and bars on
Saturday night in a show of ""unity and resilience"" a week on from the terror attack. The British Red Cross is calling for people to come together in a ""Saturday Night for
London"" where they can take a ""ride for London, eat a dish for London and say
cheers to London."" Restaurants, including those in the area of the attack, will donate money from
a chosen dish, while cafes, pubs and bars will ask for donations of the price of
a drink. Donald Hyslop, Borough Market chairman of trustees, said: ""Borough Market is
not just a collection of stalls, restaurants and pubs; it is a community of
people. ""Never has that been more apparent than it is now, in this darkest of hours. ""This community has been shaken to its core by Saturday's horrific events, but
bolstered by the love, togetherness and defiance of this vibrant, diverse city
it will carry on doing what it has always done - celebrating the pleasures of
good food and conversation."" Nick BeakeHome affairs correspondent, BBC London There's been a five-fold increase in Islamophobic incidents since the attack, the mayor of London has said. There were 20 incidents reported yesterday - the 2017 daily average is 3.5. There's also been a rise in hate crime reported to the Met since the attack, with 54 reports  yesterday - the daily average in 2017 is 38. Sadiq Khan said: ""Just as
the police will do everything possible to root out extremism from our city, so
we will take a zero-tolerance approach to hate crime."" One of the victims of Saturday's terror attack has been confirmed as Sara Zelenak. In a statement, her family said: ""We are
deeply saddened at the tragic loss of our beautiful daughter and sister of
Harrison and Scott. ""Sara's
family and friends are devastated. ""We would like to thank
our friends and family who are helping us through this very difficult time."" Police say the death toll from the attacks on Saturday night has now risen to eight after they recovered a body from the River Thames on Tuesday evening. They were searching for missing French national Xavier Thomas. Mr Thomas's next of kin have been told, police said, but formal identification has not yet taken place The BBC understands Australian Sara Zelenak is among those who were killed. Sebastien Belanger 36 and Ignacio Echeverria, 39 are both still missing. Head teachers are urged to review planned school trips in the wake of recent terror attacks. A 30-year-old has been arrested for terrorism offences after a search warrant was carried out at a property in east London in the early hours. The Met said officers entered the address in Ilford at 01:30. He has been taken to a south London police station for questioning. A large part of the police cordon around the scene of Saturday night's attack has been lifted this morning. Borough High Street and the roads and area east of the high street have reopened to the public, although Borough Market and a small surrounding area remain closed. Allow Twitter content?

"The boss of British Airways' parent company says that human error caused an IT meltdown that led to travel chaos for 75,000 passengers. Willie Walsh, chief executive of IAG, said an engineer disconnected a power supply, with the major damage caused by a surge when it was reconnected. He said there would now be an independent investigation ""to learn from the experience"". However, some experts say that blaming a power surge is too simplistic. Mr Walsh, appearing at an annual airline industry conference in Mexico on Monday, said: ""It's very clear to me that you can make a mistake in disconnecting the power. ""It's difficult for me to understand how to make a mistake in reconnecting the power,"" he said. He told reporters that the engineer was authorised to be in the data centre, but was not authorised ""to do what he did"". IAG has commissioned an ""independent company to conduct a full investigation"" into the IT crash and is ""happy to disclose details"" of its findings, Mr Walsh said. The name of the company involved had not been disclosed. The BBC reported last week that senior company executives at IAG werepushing for an external probe into the computer meltdown. BA had said that a power surge caused the computer problem, but gave little further explanation. However, an email leaked to the media last week suggested that a contractor doing maintenance work inadvertently switched off the power supply. The email said: ""This resulted in the total immediate loss of power to the facility, bypassing the backup generators and batteries... After a few minutes of this shutdown, it was turned back on in an unplanned and uncontrolled fashion, which created physical damage to the systems and significantly exacerbated the problem."" But the BBC's transport correspondent, Richard Westcott,has spoken to IT expertswho are sceptical that a power surge could wreak such havoc on the data centres. BA has two data centres about a kilometre apart. There are question marks over whether a power surge could hit both. Also, there should be fail-safes in place, our correspondent said. BA has already launched its own internal investigation, led by its chief executive Alex Cruz. Following the computer crash, which caused travel chaos for people travelling from Heathrow and Gatwick, Mr Walsh gave his full backing to Mr Cruz. BA and IAG also rejected claims that the incident was due to Mr Cruz's decision to outsource the airline's IT department to India as part of cost-cutting measures. Also on Monday, Mr Walsh apologised again for the incident, saying: ""When you see customers who suffered, you wouldn't want it to happen to any airline or any business."" He added: ""I wouldn't suggest for one minute we got communications right at BA, we didn't."" Cruz control: BA's unanswered questions Why did 'power surge' hit BA computers?

"Police have named one of the attackers as Khuram Butt (pictured) Khuram Butt wore an Arsenal shirt during his murderous assault on other Londoners. Some of those whom he wanted to kill may too have been wearing the club's colours. But his real colours were the same as many other major terror suspects of the last few years. He was a follower of the banned al-Muhajiroun network, led by the now-jailed preacher Anjem Choudary. How are UK extremists radicalised? How people in London fought back In pictures: Crowds gather for vigil Butt was 27 years old, born in April 1990 in Pakistan. He was a British citizen and had lived in east London for a number of years. He was married with two children. His online CV describes him as having an NVQ Level 2 in business administration and he went on to work in 2012 for a company that manages Kentucky Fried Chicken outlets. Transport for London has confirmed he worked for almost six months in 2016 as a trainee customer services assistant, leaving in October. He was also once the sole director of a now-dissolved company called Kool Kosmetics. Mourners have been laying tributes to the victims near London Bridge It's still not clear when he got involved in radical Islamist politics, but there is ample evidence that he was involved in the al-Muhajiroun network - certainly in 2015 and potentially at least two years earlier still. The main evidence comes from his appearance in a Channel 4 documentary, The Jihadis Next Door, broadcast last year. The film was a close encounter with part of the ALM network and one of its subjects was Siddhartha Dhar, one of Anjem Choudary's right-hand men. Dhar later skipped bail for Syria. Once there, he appeared in a black mask in an IS execution video. In the documentary, Butt appears in one of the key scenes with others from the group angrily arguing with a police officer who said there had been a call that the men had displayed an ""ISIS-looking flag"" in one of London's parks. Another key figure in the film is Abu Haleema, who has been subject to intensive monitoring by the security services after they discovered his close contacts with a teenager - later to becomethe youngest child in Britain to be convicted of a terrorism offence. Butt's links may go back further still. Mohammed Shafiq of the Manchester-based Ramadhan Foundation, an anti-extremism group, says that he believes he was verbally assaulted by Butt in 2013 - the day after another ALM follower killed Fusilier Lee Rigby in Woolwich, south-east London. ""Khuram Butt called me a 'Murtad', which means traitor in Arabic, and accused me of being a government stooge when I confronted Anjem Choudary about him supporting terrorism,"" he says. ""The police turned up and Anjem, Khuram Butt and two other men were escorted away. I am not surprised that Khuram Butt carried out the terrorist attack and there are serious questions for the authorities."" This video can not be played Khuram Butt was shown in a documentary about extremists In Barking, east London, one resident, Erica Gasparri, told the BBC she had her own concerns that Butt and three other men had been attempting to radicalise her children. She told our team that she went to Barking police station about a year to a year-and-a-half ago with photos of the men and explained her concerns. Another man - who did not want to be identified - told the BBC that Butt had expressed his disgust at the ""scantily clad"" way some women were dressed during his time at Transport for London. That man was so worried by his extreme views - including apparent support for an American online advocate for the Syrian jihad - that he called the anti-terror hotline. Butt also appears to have taken part in a confrontational ALM network campaign in 2015 to intimidate Muslims into not voting, on the basis that it was forbidden by God. When he interrupted an Imam at the local Jabir Bin Zayid Mosque after the subject of voting was raised, he was asked to leave. So did the police or MI5 miss something? According to Scotland Yard, he became known to both in the summer of 2015 - but there was no intelligence that he was then plotting. An investigation was opened into his behaviour after concerns had reached counter-terrorism officers. He became one of the 500 active investigations on the go at any one time. After that file was opened, there was a call from a member of the public about Butt's radicalisation - but it didn't lead to any intelligence that there was definitely something going on. It's not clear when that call came in - and what other cases were pressing - but ultimately Butt was not considered a priority and he was placed in the lower echelons of the long list of individuals under investigation. Critically, that meant Butt would attract less investigatory resources. The question is whether there was, at the time, anything in his covert communications that might have led to a different decision, had it been known.

"This video can not be played Donald Trump challenged London Mayor Sadiq Khan to an IQ test US President Donald Trump has again lashed out at London Mayor Sadiq Khan over his assurances to Londoners following Saturday's terror attack. He accused Mr Khan of offering a ""pathetic excuse"" for saying there was no reason for people to be alarmed. Mr Khan had in fact said people should not be alarmed by an increased police presence. After a vigil for the victims of the attack, Mr Khan said he would not allow Mr Trump to ""divide our communities"". Seven people were killed and 48 others injured in the attack on Saturday. Mr Trump took issue with Mr Khan's statement in the aftermath of the attack, when the mayor said: ""Londoners will see an increased police presence today and over the course of the next few days. No reason to be alarmed."" The US president responded: ""At least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is 'no reason to be alarmed!'"" He followed this up with another tweet on Monday, saying: ""Pathetic excuse by London Mayor Sadiq Khan who had to think fast on his ""no reason to be alarmed"" statement. MSM [mainstream media] is working hard to sell it!"" The mayor's spokesman earlier made clear that he was telling Londoners not to be worried about the increased presence of armed police officers in the city. Is Trump's thin skin to blame? A skateboard, a crate: How London fought back This video can not be played Sadiq Khan: 'This is our city, these are our values and this is our way of life'. Speaking to the BBC after the vigil, Mr Khan said: ""We've got to recognise that some people want to divide our communities, some people thrive on fuelling division. ""That's not me, that's not the London  I know, and we aren't going to allow anybody, whether it's Donald Trump or anybody else to divide our community."" His spokesperson earlier said he ""has more important things to do than respond to Donald Trump's ill-informed tweet that deliberately takes out of context"" the mayor's remarks. Mr Trump's attacks on Mr Khan have drawn condemnation from both sides of the Atlantic. His critics have accused him of being insensitive and twisting the mayor's words. Politicians in the UK on Monday called on the prime minister to withdraw the invitation for Mr Trump's state visit later this year. The leader of the Liberal Democrats, Tim Farron, said: ""This is a man insulting our national values at a time of introspection and mourning."" Over the weekend, Prime Minister Theresa May refused to criticise Mr Trump, simply saying that Mr Khan was doing a ""good job"". British voters go to the polls on Thursday in a general election. ""Try to imagine the UK prime minister attacking the Mayor of NYC the day after 9/11,"" said European Parliament cabinet member Simon O'Connor. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio was quick to defend Mr Khan, praising him for ""doing exactly the right thing"". ""I don't understand why Donald Trump is trying to undermine a man who's trying to protect the people of London. It makes no sense,"" Mr de Blasio told the BBC's Nick Bryant during a press conference in New York on Monday.Trump renews feud with mayor of London This video can not be played New York mayor on his London counterpart: ""He deserves support, not efforts to undermine him"" The US Conference of Mayors, representing more than 1,400 American cities, backed Mr Khan. ""He has risen above this crisis of death and destruction, as mayors continue to do, to alleviate fear, to bring comfort to his people of London,"" the mayorswrote in a statement on Sunday,external. Mr Khan, a Muslim, has previously criticised the president's plans to temporarily restrict travel to the US from six mainly Muslim countries. After Mr Trump as a presidential candidate announced his plan, Mr Khan told the BBC he hoped he would""lose badly"", adding that he was a ""buffoon"". He also called Mr Trump's views on Islam ""ignorant"", leading the New York billionaire tochallenge him to an IQ test. In the wake of the London attack, Mr Trump has been tweeting about his stalled travel ban. This video can not be played Sadiq Khan: ""[Donald Trump's] views are divisive, they're outrageous and I hope he loses - badly"" Federal courts struck down the first proposal in January. The administration replaced it with a less stringent version order in March, but that also ended up in limbo after legal defeats. On Monday, the president attacked the Justice Department for revising the original measure, leaving it ""watered down"" and ""politically correct"". The Trump administration is expected to take the proposal to the Supreme Court next week. He argues the measure is needed to prevent attacks in the US, but critics say the policy is discriminatory and has little national security justification. Trump challenges Khan to IQ test.

"John Robert Neumann had a history of misdemeanour criminal offences A disgruntled US employee walked back into the factory that fired him and fatally shot five ex-colleagues, before killing himself, police say.

"Police bomb experts arrive at the scene in Melbourne Australian police are treating as a ""terrorist incident"" a Melbourne siege in which a gunman was killed. Heavily armed officers arrived at an apartment building on Monday after reports of an explosion and found one man already dead in the foyer. Another man, Yacqub Khayre, was armed with a shotgun and holding a woman inside the building against her will. Khayre, 29, called a broadcaster during the siege to say he was acting in the name of the Islamic State (IS) group. This video can not be played Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull says the siege was ""a shocking and cowardly crime"" A news outlet for the group claimed it had carried out the attack, but police said there was no evidence of it co-ordinating with Khayre. Three police officers suffered injuries after Khayre engaged them in a firefight in which he was shot dead. The hostage was rescued unharmed. Yacqub Khayre at a court appearance in Melbourne in 2010 Victoria Police Chief Commissioner Graham Ashton said the victim who died, a building employee, was ""in the wrong place at the wrong time"". Authorities were investigating whether Khayre, a Somali-born Australian citizen, may have lured officers to the wealthy suburb of Brighton with the aim of confronting them. Mr Ashton said comments Khayre made referencing IS and al-Qaeda had prompted the terrorism investigation. Two London attackers named by police Sydney cafe siege police 'waited too long' ""We do not yet know if this was something he was really planning or whether it was just an ad hoc decision that he has made just to go off tap like this,"" Mr Ashton said. ""They (IS) always tend to jump up and claim responsibility every time something happens,"" Mr Ashton said. He said Khayre had been acquitted over a foiled plot to attack a Sydney army barracks in 2009. He had ""a long criminal history"" and was on parole after being released from jail on a separate offence last year, Mr Ashton said. The gunman had arranged to meet the woman through an escort service before taking her hostage, he said. Neighbours and people in the area described hearing loud gunfire at the scene. ""Everyone just panicked,"" one witness, Luke Fourniotis, told theHerald Sun,external. ""I started running but I didn't know where the shots were coming from so I had this thought: 'Are they shooting at us?' My heart was in my throat."" Nearby resident Graeme Hisgrove said heavily armed police officers went through his backyard during the operation. Police closed surrounding streets as the incident unfolded ""We were just in the front room of the house and all the rapid fire started, so we all hit the deck on the floor and just didn't know what was going on,"" he told theAustralian Broadcasting Corp,external. On Tuesday, police raided a house reportedly shared by Khayre and his mother, seizing computers, other electronic devices and books. Prime Minster Malcolm Turnbull said the case raised ""grave concerns"" about the parole system which he said would be addressed. ""How was this man on parole? He had a long record of violence. A very long record of violence,"" Mr Turnbull said. ""These are important issues and Australians need to be assured that people who are a threat to their safety are not being released on parole."" Mr Turnbull said Australia's official terror threat level would remain at ""probable"".

"Qatar has been accused of supporting terror On Monday 5 June 2017, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt, the UAE, and the internationally recognised Yemeni government severed their diplomatic relations with Qatar, accusing Doha of supporting terrorism. In addition, the states announced that they were suspending air, sea, and land transport with Qatar, while Qatari citizens are required to return home within two weeks. Qatar's support of the Saudi and UAE-led operations in Yemen is also suspended. This might seem familiar. These states (aside from Yemen) withdrew their diplomats from Doha in 2014 over a similar set of concerns. That spat was resolved within nine months. But the core issues remain. On this occasion, though similar motives fuel the dispute, the fact that Qatar's land border with Saudi Arabia - its only land crossing - will be suspended shows a severe escalation, given just how critical this border is for Qatar's imports, including food. Reports emerged in late May 2017 of a speech given by the Qatari Emir, Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, where he was purported to have criticised America, offered support for Iran, reaffirmed Qatar's support for Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood, and said that Qatar's relations with Israel were ""good"". Qatar's official news agency then also reported that Qatar was withdrawing its ambassadors from Saudi, Bahrain, Egypt, and the UAE after discovering a ""conspiracy"" against Qatar. Subsequently, Qatari officials furiously denied that there was any truth behind these reports, but the damage was done. Arab countries cut links with Qatar All you need to know about Qatar Food, flights and football at risk The key problem was that these comments simply voiced out loud what many have long understood as Qatar's true policy positions. Qatar has long had a tense relationship with the US. On a military-to-military level, the two countries co-operate well generally. But the US has long been angered by what it sees as slanted coverage in the Middle East by Qatar-owned Al Jazeera, Qatar's apparent support for a range of Islamist groups around the region, and lax anti-terrorist financing laws. Similarly, Qatar has been bold in its support of Hamas, the Palestinian militant group affiliated to the Muslim Brotherhood. In May 2017, Qatar used its influence topush,externalHamas to issue a policy document seen by some as an attempt to soften its extremist image. But support for Hamas places Qatar deeply at odds with many states, such as the US, who view Hamas as a terrorist organization. And the other Gulf monarchies prefer to deal with its secular rival Fatah as representatives for the Palestinians. But the problem is that Qatar is just too bold, too often. The core issue presently is Qatar's support of Islamists around the Middle East region, which emerged quite evidently during the Arab Spring. This is as much a result of the personalised politics of Qatar's foreign policy and elite bureaucracy as it is an active decision by Qatar to support Islamists. Moreover, Qatar argues vociferously that it does not support Islamists because the state prefers to, but because such groups like the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood enjoy significant public support. Qatar's Emir Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani is alleged to have given a speech in May criticising the US Either way, the UAE inparticular,external, but also Saudi Arabia, do not agree at all with this approach of emboldening Islamist groups around the region. They tried to get Qatar to stop doing this in 2014, but, a few concessions aside, the broad tenor of Qatar's foreign policy approach did not change. Otherwise, particularly under the leadership of the former Emir Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, Qatar sought to carve out a unique niche for itself and its policies, such as augmenting relations with Israel or Iran, and rejecting the wider consensus of the regional group of the monarchies, the Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC). Saudi Arabia withdrew its ambassador to Doha from 2002 to 2008 to try to pressure Qatar to curb its individualistic tendencies. This approach broadly failed too. Saudi Arabia and the UAE, the leaders of this current move, will not want to fail again. And their position is strong, while Qatar's is weak. Saudi Arabia and the UAE are emboldened. Leading the intervention in Yemen in 2015 displayed a newfound desire to truly lead on matters of regional security. And the UAE has, not least with a decade's operations alongside Isaf forces in Afghanistan, forged a reputation for itself as one of the US's most reliable Arab partners. Then President Trump unprecedentedly took his first foreign visit to Saudi Arabia, and signed the largest weapons deal in history. The only real card that Qatar holds with Washington is that it has, since the early 1990s, hosted a critical US base at al-Udeid. But this may no longer be enough. Other Gulf states may stand ready to replace this key base, though the logistics of this would not be straightforward. The argument to President Trump may be compelling: with US help, Qatar might be persuaded to evict Hamas leadership from Doha and genuinely cut back on funding Islamist groups. It seems that the time of Qatar's individualistic foreign policy may be up. Dr David Roberts is a lecturer in the Defence Studies Department at King's College London.

"A number of people put their safety at risk and helped others during Saturday's attack on London Bridge and Borough Market, which left eight people dead and 48 injured. Among them was a baker who wielded a bread crate at the attackers, as well as a man who used his skateboard to protect people, with supermarket workers offering free food and drink to emergency workers. Sunday Express business editor Geoff Ho was injured trying to help a bouncer Sunday Express business editor Geoff Ho dragged his wounded friend to safety while at the Black & Blue restaurant in Southwark - despite himself being stabbed in the neck. Earlier that night, he had helped a bouncer at the Southwark Tavern being attacked by two unarmed men, but said in astatement on Tuesday that the incident happened before he confronted the terrorists,external. ""At that point I thought 'job done, now for beer and food',"" he said. ""Within two minutes of my leaving the Southwark Tavern and posting 'not on my watch' on Facebook, the terrorist attackers arrived at the restaurant. ""Most of my friends and the staff hid under tables but one of my friends was frozen behind me."" The journalist said he ""tried to slow"" the attackers, who appeared to be wearing suicide vests. Victims of the attack What we know so far Who were the attackers? ""I think I got a hit in on one of them, but either he or his accomplice got me with a shot to the throat. ""They got my friend who was behind me with a minor stab wound in the face and hands and ran off. ""I picked up my friend and bundled him into the store room. I called the police and within moments they arrived. I gave the police descriptions of the three and we were evacuated."" Footage of him being escorted to an ambulance,externalby police has been posted on the Daily Express website. In it he is clutching his neck and using his shirt as a bandage. Mr Ho said he would make a full recovery and thanked staff at the Royal London Hospital. Ignacio had been cycling back from a park with two friends he had been skateboarding with when the attack began A Spanish man who used his skateboard to try to defend a woman who was being stabbed by one of the attackers has now been named as being one of the eight people killed. Ignacio EcheverrÃ­a, 39, saw the attack unfolding at London Bridge andrushed to help the woman. According to his father, friends saw the HSBC employee from Madrid, ""lying on the floor on the sidewalk after defending someone with his skateboard"".

PC Charlie Guenigault, pictured on the night of the London attack Off-duty police officer Charlie Guenigault - an amateur rugby player - was stabbed after tackling one of the three men. He was injured after rushing to the aid of a British Transport Police officer who had faced the attackers with only a baton. The family of the 25-year-old, who serves as an emergency response officer for the Southwark borough, said he ""showed immense bravery"". In a statement, they added: ""Given the opportunity again, Charlie would no doubt do exactly the same if faced with the same situation; helping a fellow police officer in need and protecting the public. ""He is immensely proud to work for the Metropolitan Police Service and serving the Southwark community, and this is an example of that. ""Charlie is described by his peers as a dedicated police officer, who is a diligent, hardworking and respected member of his team"". Met Police commissioner Cressida Dick praised the ""utterly heroic"" actions of the officer, who is in a stable condition in hospital. She said: ""It's hard to pick out individual stories but I am immensely proud of him and what he did."" The BTP officer, who has not been named, was seriously injured but is now in a stable condition. Chief Constable Paul Crowther from the BTP said the bravery he showed was ""outstanding"". The officer, who was stabbed in the attack, has said he has been ""truly moved and overwhelmed by all the support"".

When they told him that three men were stabbing people in the market, he headed outside with two crates to tackle the attackers. Speaking to the Victoria Derbyshire show, he said: ""I felt pity for the victims, I didn't know how to handle things or react, I thought to myself I'm also in danger. ""I just threw the crate at [one of the attackers]. ""I threw the first crate and I knew he was going to dodge it. While he was dodging it, I walked towards him and hit him in the head with the other crate."" He said a policeman then shouted at him to stand back, before discharging a stun grenade. Roy Larner was stabbed five times while attempting to shield people from the attackers. Friends have raised more than Â£10,000 for Mr Larner, who say he is now in intensive care, to go towards his recovery. Jayne Jacob, who set up a JustGiving page on Sunday, said: ""Roy got caught up in the terror attack at London Bridge and was badly injured whilst protecting lives.

Carlos (left) and Giovanni were in a restaurant where an attacker stabbed a woman Giovanni Sagristani, 38, and his friends were in the El Pastor restaurant on Stoney Street when one of the attackers came in and stabbed a woman in the chest.

Mr Sagristani's partner Carlos Pinto, 33, who works as a critical care nurse in London, looked after the woman, with the help of his friend, another nurse. ""They took some ice and cloths and tried to stop the bleeding. She lost half a litre of blood in the beginning. He was keeping pressure on the wound,"" Mr Sagristani said. He said fellow diners had managed to push the attacker out of the restaurant by throwing chairs and bottles at him. Once the attacker was outside, staff lowered a security gate and locked people inside. Diners threw chairs and bottles at the attacker ""After the initial moment of panic, everyone tried to help this girl and stay calm. We were all at the back of the restaurant.

Justin Bieber was on stage at the moment PC Taylor was seen dancing ""We were just there to play our part helping our Greater Manchester Police colleagues after such an enormous and tragic event."" It may only have lasted for a few seconds on screen, but it was seized upon by fans as a symbol of Manchester's spirit of resilience. And it's fair to say the city feels a certain bond with Ariana, as many of the tweets on Sunday night proved. ""So impressed with Ariana Grande's strength and love for her fans. Seems they have an unbreakable bond in Manchester now,""said,externalfan Graeme Shield. The concert was watched by an average of 10.9 million viewers, peaking at 14.5 million as the gig drew to a close - making it the most watched TV show of the year so far. It also broke iPlayer records for the most watched non-sporting live event in the catch-up service's history. The BBC said more than 1.07 million viewers requested to watch the gig live via iPlayer on Sunday evening. The dancing policeman was one ofseveral momentswhich made concertgoers and viewers emotional. Katy Perry's performance was one of the highlights of the evening. She perfectly captured the mood of the night by performing Part of Me and Roar - probably the two most lyrically poignant songs from her back catalogue she could choose to sing. But music aside, there was one other seriously classy touch which went unnoticed by many. When she took off her white-feathered gown, it became apparent the singer was wearing a dress which had photographs printed on it - which appeared to include some of the victims of the Manchester attack. Taking to social media, fansdescribed,externalit as a ""beautiful gesture"". Joan Grande, the singer's mother, was spotted in the crowd, supporting her daughter and meeting members of the audience. She was seen walking around the edge of the crowd, stopping for selfies and hugs with several fans on the way and telling one: ""Do not be afraid."" She had previouslytweeted,external: ""I stand with you all in the face of evil and we stand together to never let it ruin our lives."" Viewers certainly noticed the love flowing between Miley Cyrus and Ariana Grande as they took to the stage to perform Don't Dream its Over as a duet. The pair exchanged looks of pure love, shared hugs and got the whole audience to wave their hands in unison to the Crowded House song. Speaking afterwards, Miley said she wanted to turn such events into a regular occurrence. She told Nick Grimshaw: ""I plan on making music for the rest of my life, and I think that's [Ariana's] plan too, and I think we can be this team until we're old, continue to do things like this, let's not stop today. ""I spoke to her about whether this is going to become an annual thing, let's make it a plan that her and I always do it, so we're always going to make sure that we keep doing this for the rest of our lives."" Crowded House front man Neil Finn tweeted his approval of the them joining forces. Ariana Grande's manager Scooter Braun introduced the singer on stage at the show, and took the opportunity to pay a graceful and emotional tribute to those who were caught up in the attack. He made reference to the terrorist attack on London Bridge on Saturday evening, in which seven people were killed and 48 injured. Speaking from the stage at One Love Manchester, Braun said: ""Last night this nation was challenged, and you had a decision to make if you were going to come out here tonight. ""And this is so beautiful. You guys made that decision, you looked fear right in the face and said: 'No, we are Manchester and the world is watching'."" Grande performed with the Black Eyed Peas at the benefit gig Braun also told the audience about a 15-year-old boy named Adam, who was injured in the Manchester Arena attack, whom he met on Friday in hospital. He explained: ""After surgery we met him, and just as I was about to leave the room, Adam looked at me and he said, 'Hey Scooter, make sure you tell them, don't go forward in anger, love spreads'. Adam - if you're watching, you're our hero tonight. ""This tragedy has made us throw away our divides, or politics, and look to our children. Manchester, your bravery is our hope.""

"Salman Abedi (pictured) carried out the bombing in Manchester Ismail Abedi, the brother of Manchester bomber Salman Abedi, has been released without charge. The 24-year-old was arrested after the attack at Manchester Arena, as police looked for evidence of a terror network in the area. A total of 18 people were arrested after the suicide attack on 22 May that killed 22 people and injured 116 as they left an Ariana Grande concert. Ten men still remain in custody. Manchester attack: What we know so far Arena attack victim loss 'immeasurable' Policeman captures Manchester's spirit Attacker Abedi, 22, detonated a home-made bomb in the arena's foyer just after 22:30 BST. The blast killed young people attending the event and friends and family who were waiting to meet them. Abedi was one of three siblings and was born in Manchester to a family of Libyan origin. His older brother, Ismail, was arrested the day after the bombing after a raid by police in Whalley Range, but was released without charge on Monday. Abedi's younger brother Hasham, 20, was detained in Tripoli on suspicion of links with the so-called Islamic State group on the same day. Reuters news agency told the BBC that Abedi's father, Ramadan, had also been detained in Libya.

Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg says: ""In many ways it does remind us of a kind of politics that went some time ago because the gulf between the two main parties - between Labour and the Tories  - is the biggest contrast we have seen for many years. ""It is a wide choice and we've seen people around the country responding to that. Whatever the result, in the last few elections we have seen a splintering of the control of the main two parties. ""But I suspect we will see the biggest share for the two main parties that we've seen for quite some time - a return for the two ""tribes"" is something that has developed over the last couple of weeks.

"Police have identified the three attackers who killed seven people and injured 48 in London on Saturday. What do we know of how UK extremists become radicalised? In her statement following the attack at London Bridge, Prime Minister Theresa May once againhighlighted the role of the internet as a ""safe space""for terrorist recruitment and radicalisation. Over the past five years, we have tracked the flow of foreign fighters into Syria and Iraq, collecting information on nearly 800 Western recruits - often including their social media footprints. Our experience and research suggests that radicalisation rarely happens exclusively online, and that the role of the internet is complex. What we know of the radicalisation trajectory of one of the alleged attackers in London Bridge demonstrates this. A former friend told the BBC's Asian Network that he had reported the man to the authorities after he had become a follower of Ahmad Musa Jibril through the internet. Mr Jibril is a Palestinian-American radical cleric based in Michigan, who developed a prolific online following among Western recruits to the Syrian jihad. More than half of recruits to the so-called Islamic State who we studied for a 2014 report,externalwere following him on Facebook or Twitter - making him an important figure. We found that he did not openly incite his followers to violence, or explicitly encourage them to join the Syrian jihad. Instead, he adopted the role of ideological cheerleader, supporting the principles of armed opposition to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and making people feel guilty for not joining the fight. What we know so far 'I reported the attacker' How has armed policing changed? Tributes left for victims However, our research suggests that the decisive factor in moving people from being extremists in terms of their thoughts and beliefs to becoming terrorists is not online propaganda but offline social networks. It now seems likely that at least one of the attackers had been part of the extremist network al-Muhajiroun - based around the notorious British extremist Anjem Choudary, who wasconvicted of inviting others to support ISin 2016. Choudary also had a YouTube channel, but practically all of his followers were known to him personally and were recruited face to face. Anjem Choudary was jailed for inviting others to support IS What he offered was a sense of community, belonging, and camaraderie within a circle of peers. This builds strong interpersonal bonds based on what has been called ""in-group love"". The internet plays an important role in terms of disseminating information and building the brand of organisations such as IS, but it is rarely sufficient in replacing the potency and charm of a real-world recruiter. Perhaps more than any other radical cluster, the network around Choudary has been linked to scores of attacks, both at home and abroad, and dozens of foreign fighters joining IS in Syria. It is one thing for the internet companies to pull down radical propaganda. But they face an uphill battle while preachers such as Choudary have spent years spreading their message virtually unchallenged on British streets.

"The PM says internet giants have provided a ""safe space"" for extremist ideology Prime Minister Theresa May has said more must be done to tackle terror online. In a speech on Sunday, following the terrorist attack in London, she said the internet provided a ""safe space"" for extremist ideology to breed. But technology companies and cyber-security experts have warned that tighter regulation of the internet will not solve this problem. Messages sent online can be scrambled as they leave one device and they remain scrambled until they are deciphered by the recipient's device. This is end-to-endencryption,and it stops messages being read by third parties - be it criminals or law enforcement - if they are intercepted. This adds valuable security to the messages we send online, which could contain private information, bank details and personal photographs. Some apps such as WhatsApp already add end-to-end encryption to messages automatically. WhatsApp messages are end-to-end encrypted However, this does mean that theoretically messages can be sent that police or other authorities cannot read if they intercept them. On Sunday, Mrs May said there should be no messages that law enforcement ""cannot read"", while Home Secretary Amber Rudd said she wanted tech companies to ""limit the use of end-to-end encryption"". Critics say disabling encryption in popular apps will not deter criminals - they could simply switch from one app to another, or create their own messaging apps. Meanwhile, messages sent by law-abiding citizens would become ""easy for criminals, voyeurs and foreign spies to intercept"", journalist and former digital rights activist Cory Doctorowwrote in a blog.,external Cyber-security experts are particularly critical of the notion that messaging apps should have a ""back door"" in their systems, to let authorities read users' messages. ""It's impossible to overstate how bonkers the idea of sabotaging cryptography is to people who understand information security,"" said Mr Doctorow. ""Use deliberately compromised cryptography, that has a back door that only the 'good guys' are supposed to have the keys to, and you have effectively no security."" Even if app-makers were ordered to stop using encryption, it would be very difficult to stop criminals encrypting their messages manually, or writing them in code. On Sunday, Mrs May said large internet companies provided a ""safe space"" for extremist ideology to breed. Earlier this year, aHome Affairs Select Committee reportsaid social networks were ""shamefully far"" from tackling illegal and dangerous content and took too long to remove offending posts. The volume of material uploaded to Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and other social networks is astonishing, making it difficult to moderate. YouTube says 400 hours worth of video are uploaded to its platform every minute, making it impossible to review every clip a user posts. Hundreds of hours of video are uploaded to YouTube every minute The Open Rights Group, which campaigns for online freedoms, said governments and companies should ""take sensible measures to stop abuse"" but warned that ""attempts to control the internet"" would be difficult to enforce. Technology companies have defended their handling of extremist content following the London terror attack. YouTube told the BBC that it received 200,000 reports of inappropriate content a day, but managed to review 98% of them within 24 hours. It said hate speech made up a small proportion of the ""tens of millions"" of videos it removed every year. Facebook said: ""Using a combination of technology and human review, we work aggressively to remove terrorist content from our platform as soon as we become aware of it - and if we become aware of an emergency involving imminent harm to someone's safety, we notify law enforcement."" It said it actively worked to identify extremist accounts and worked with rivals Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube to help identify such content. Both Facebook and Google have stated that extremist content has no place on their websites. Germany hastried to further motivateinternet giants, by threatening them with fines of up to 50m euros (Â£43.5m) if they fail to remove hate speech quickly. However, the Open Rights Group warned that tough regulation by governments ""could push these vile networks into even darker corners of the web, where they will be even harder to observe"".

""When you're 19, you're Superman - you can walk through walls, you are indestructible, you are the master of the universe, you've got everything in front of you."" Mick Hermanis was one of 26,000 men and women who were sent from the UK to defend the Falkland Islands in 1982.

Now in their 50s, as teenagers these men knew little of what they were getting themselves into. Yet their lives have been shaped by their Falklands experience. Mick says it broke his heart to be given a ""heroes welcome"" on his return from the Falklands Mick Hermanis survived theattack on the Sir Galahadlanding ship - where the Welsh Guards suffered their heaviest losses, and where many of his friends died. This, combined with the fact that he never fired a bullet during the war, has left him with a strong feeling of survivor guilt. On his return home from war, he says: ""All the neighbours in the street were out and [I had] a bloody big hero's welcome"". He says it ""broke my heart"" to be given such a welcome when some of his mates would never return. Mick was extremely nervous and apprehensive about returning to the Falklands. He had planned to go back in 2008 but bottled it at the last minute. He says: ""Not a single day that goes by when you don't think about it... think about the boysâ¦ friends that we lost... some bloody fantastic boys.""

Nigel saw his trip back to the Falklands as his last chance to get his life back on track Nigel O'Keefe was 18 when he served in the infantry in the Falklands. At first, he says he ""blanked"" his experiences, ""but as I grew older it started eating away at me"". Nigel's defining memory was when his platoon found itself in one of the many minefields laid by the Argentines. He told Panorama: ""We were advancing, it was pitch black, there was tracer flying everywhere and a guy from the SAS came running out the single fire line and told everyone to stop - he said we're in a minefield. ""And as soon as he's told us that I could hear this screaming, high-pitched, really, really high-pitched screaming and I said: 'What the hell are women and kids doing out here?', like. ""I found out then it was two Royal Marines who'd stepped on anti-personnel mines. ""I've never heard a grown man scream so high-pitched like that."" Having never really addressed his PTSD and depression, he still suffers from terrible nightmares, and he masks his problems with alcohol. It has caused him to lose both his job and his family; he is divorced and his four children rarely come to visit. Nigel saw his trip back to the Falklands as his last chance to get his life back on track - since the trip he has given up alcohol and is working on repairing his relationship with his children. Will says he is lucky to have his art as a ""safety valve"" to help alleviate painful memories Will Kevans rarely talks about the Falklands, unless he's had a few drinks. He was 19 when he went to war and his memories still haunt him. ""I remember walking up and seeing something in the road and it was the body of a dead Argentine soldier and, for reasons I still don't understand today, I put my hand down and wanted to look at the guy's face. ""I picked his head up and it had no face. No face at all and it was just a cross section of his skull. ""All of his teeth were all over the place, bone fragments and blood all over the place and it was something that has haunted me for a very long time. ""Some of the lads were looking through his possessions and they found photographs of his family and it just made me think immediately that this man could have been me."" After the war Will stayed in the Army for a couple of years as a parachutist, but then went on to become a singer-songwriter and successful cartoonist. He has drawn Dennis the Menace and worked for the Telegraph newspaper. He says: ""I think a lot of the pain that I suffered from the Falklands, I've kind of alleviated it by being able to do art connected with itâ¦ so I'm lucky I have that safety valve"". Paul says that after the war ""inside I was hurting a lot, so much, I'd lost too many good friends"" Paul Bromwell has suffered from bouts of aggression and severe insomnia. He says the Falklands ""marked me for the rest of my life"". He spent the war in the recce platoon, meaning he was always the first one into battle. He saw a lot of action and was involved in the fighting at Goose Green and Mount Harriet. He told Panorama: ""I'd been through hell, and when I went home it just seemed nothing had changed - everybody was carrying on with their life and yet inside I was hurting a lot, so much, I'd lost too many good friends"". Almost immediately he began to suffer from PTSD and a severe feeling of not belonging in society. He drank his way through it and completed a treatment programme, but he remains very affected by the conflict. ""It's a devil really, because you can't see the injury, everyone thinks you're all right but underneath you're screaming,"" he says. Today, he runs veteran self-help groups and takes care of mistreated horses which often exhibit similar signs of anxiety and stress.

"Fifty years ago, war broke out between Israel and its neighbours. The conflict lasted just six days but its effect would last to the present day. At the end of 1948, Israel's Arab neighbours had invaded to try to destroy the new state, and failed. The Egyptian army had been beaten, but a force surrounded in a piece of land known as the Falluja pocket refused to surrender. A group of young Egyptian and Israeli officers tried to break the impasse. Among them was Yitzhak Rabin, a 26-year-old Israeli military prodigy who was head of operations on the southern front, and the 30-year-old Egyptian Major Gamal Abdel Nasser. Just a few years after the Nazis had killed six million Jews, the dream of establishing a state in their biblical homeland had come true. Palestinians call 1948 ""al-Nakba"", or ""the Catastrophe"". Up to 750,000 Palestinians fled or were expelled from the land that became Israel, and were never allowed back. For the Arabs, defeat at the hands of the fledgling Israeli state was a seismic political moment that led to years of upheaval. Nasser became a hero in the Arab world in the wake of the Suez crisis Feeling betrayed, humiliated army officers seized power. Syria had regular military coups. Four years after the end of the war, Nasser led a group of young officers who overthrew the king of Egypt. By 1956, Nasser was president. In the same year, he defied Britain, France and Israel in the Suez crisis, and became the hero and leader of the Arab world. In Israel, Rabin continued his military career. By 1967, he was chief-of-staff, the most senior officer. Arabs could not get over the pain of defeat; the Israelis never forgot that their neighbours tried to destroy them. Both sides knew that another war would come, sooner or later. Israel and its Arab neighbours had plenty of reasons for hatred or mutual suspicion. But the Cold War in the 1950s and 1960s added extra fuel. The Soviet Union provided Egypt with a modern air force. Israel had warm relations with the United States, but it was not yet the biggest recipient of American military aid; in the 1960s Israel also bought aircraft from France and tanks from Britain. What the war meant to Israelis and Arabs The friendship that grew out of war What makes Jerusalem so holy Why aren't the Israelis and Palestinians talking? After 1948 Israel had worked endlessly to make the best of its exposed strategic position. It also absorbed more than one million immigrants - military service was an important part of making the new arrivals into Israelis. Israel built a speedy, flexible and deadly military. And by 1967 it was close to acquiring its own nuclear weapons. Yitzhak Rabin (left) was Israel's chief of staff by 1967 The new, native-born Israelis, known as ""sabras"" - the Hebrew word for prickly pear - were determined not to repeat what they believed had been the mistakes of Jews in the diaspora. They would always fight back, and sometimes fight first. Rabin was confident that Israel's armed forces were in good shape. Their mission was to win every war, on the grounds that Israel could not afford a single defeat. Egyptian forces and those of its ally Syria, trained less, boasted more and forgot that the political victory that emerged after the 1956 Suez crisis was preceded by a military defeat. Nasser concentrated on building a pan-Arab nationalist movement that his supporters fully expected would recreate Arab greatness, and exact revenge on Israel. He made his closest ally, Field Marshal Abdul Hakim Amer, commander-in-chief of the armed forces. Abdul Hakim Amir was the commander of Egypt's armed forces Egypt was an ancient country without the sense of insecurity that underlay Israel's swagger.  Amer's most important mission, which he did very well, was to make sure that the army stayed loyal by stamping out plots and keeping the officer corps happy. The military arts were much less of a priority. By 1967, Egypt was bogged down in a war in Yemen that had become its own Vietnam. It had not fought well. But Nasser could not replace Amer with a better soldier. The Syrian army was equally politicised, and like Egypt was a client of the Soviet Union. A series of generals were rotated into power by a series of coups d'Ã©tat. Arabs talked a lot about unity, socialism and nationalism, but in reality they were deeply disunited. The Syrian and Egyptian leaderships fretted about plots allegedly instigated by the monarchies in Jordan and Saudi Arabia. Kings worried that the military populists who led Syria and Egypt would incite revolution. Jordan's ruler, King Hussein, was a close ally of Britain and the US. Jordan was the only Arab state that emerged from 1948 as a winner. King Hussein of Jordan Hussein's grandfather, King Abdullah, had secret contacts with the Jewish Agency, the main body representing Jews in British Mandate Palestine; they discussed carving up the land between them in the wake of Britain's planned departure in 1948. In 1951 a Palestinian nationalist assassinated Abdullah at the al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem. Fifteen-year-old Prince Hussein saw his grandfather die, and the next day carried a gun for the first time. A year later he was king. After the 1948 war, Jordan and Israel came close, but not close enough, to making peace. Secret talks continued into Hussein's reign.  He was aware of Jordan's weaknesses - it was mainly desert and had a large and restive population of Palestinian refugees. War in 1967 came as a result of years of increasing tension and vicious border skirmishes between Arabs and Israelis. The border between Egypt and Israel was relatively quiet. The biggest flashpoint was Israel's northern border with Syria, where they fought over disputed territory and Syria's attempts to divert the River Jordan away from Israel's national water grid. The Syrians sheltered Palestinian guerrillas, who were mounting raids into Israel. Western powers had no doubt which side in the Middle East was stronger on the eve of war in 1967. The US military's Joint Chiefs of Staff judged ""that Israel will be militarily unchallengeable by any combination of Arab states at least during the next five years."" In a report on the Israeli army in January 1967, the British defence attachÃ© in Tel Aviv assessed that ""in command, training, equipment and services the Israel army is more prepared for war than ever before. Well-trained, tough, self-reliant, the Israeli soldier has a strong fighting spirit and would willingly go to war in defence of his country."" The border wars stoked the tension. Palestinian guerrillas broke through the border fence. Israel condemned them as terrorists; it believed that to deter and punish, it had to hit back hard. Jerusalem, 1965 A big Israeli raid into the Jordanian-occupied West Bank targeting the village of Samua in November 1966, followed a land mine attack inside Israel. The raid caused uproar among Palestinians in the West Bank. Hussein was aghast. He told the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) that for three years he had been in secret talks with Israel; his Israeli contacts had sent him assurances there would be no reprisals on the morning of the raid. The Americans were sympathetic. They supported a resolution at the UN Security Council condemning the Samua raid. Hussein imposed martial law on the West Bank and became more convinced than ever that his throne was in jeopardy, and that he could be overthrown by angry Palestinians. He feared a coup by radical pro-Nasser officers in the army that Israel could use as a pretext to swallow the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The king did not want to share the fate of the other Hashemite monarch in the Middle East, his cousin and friend King Faisal of Iraq. He had been shot in the yard of his palace in a military coup in 1958. The march to war continued with escalating trouble on the Israel-Syrian border. Unlike Hussein, who the Americans believed was doing all he could to stop Palestinian infiltration, Syria actively encouraged it; Israel was pushing its claims to disputed territory in the border area aggressively by cultivating fields in demilitarised areas with armoured tractors. It came to a head with a full-scale air and artillery battle between Israel and Syria on 7 April, 1967.  Israel routed the Syrians. The next morning young Palestinians in Jerusalem, according to British diplomats, showed ""a stunned awe at the Israeli competence and Arab helplessness in the face of it"" and they asked ""where were the Egyptians?"" Pressure was growing on Nasser to add action to his talk. Israel basked in a mood of national self-congratulation. But some elder statesmen and soldiers were alarmed. In a corridor in the Israeli parliament (the Knesset), the military's former chief-of-staff Moshe Dayan bumped into General Ezer Weizmann, the former head of the air force and now Rabin's number two. ""Are you out of your minds?"" Dayan said. ""You're leading the country to war!"" Moshe Dayan pushed for a quick attack Syria, and the Palestinian guerrillas it sponsored, tried even harder to provoke the Israelis, who obliged them by rising to every provocation. It looked to Syria and Egypt, as well as to Britain and the US, that Israel was planning a bigger move. An exaggerated news agency report, quoting ""a high Israeli source"" said that Israel ""would take limited military action designed to topple the Damascus army regime if Syrian terrorists continued sabotage raids inside Israel"". The source was Brigadier General Aharon Yariv, the head of military intelligence. He mentioned toppling the regime only as the most extreme of a range of possibilities. But the report was taken seriously in Syria - and also in the Israeli press. Then an intervention by the Soviet Union changed everything. On 13 May, Moscow delivered a warning to Cairo that Israel was massing troops on the border with Syria and would attack within a week. Why exactly the Soviet Union fired the starting pistol for war has been debated ever since. Two Israeli historians, Isabella Ginor and Gideon Remez, argue that the USSR deliberately instigated the crisis; they say it wanted to block Israel's nuclear weapons plans; and that the Soviets were ready to commit their own forces to the fight. At the time a ""medium-level"" Soviet official told the CIA that the Soviet Union was stirring up the Arabs to try to make trouble for the US. With the big problems in Vietnam, another war in the Middle East would be an even worse headache. In 1967 neither Israel nor its Arab neighbours needed much encouragement. They plunged straight into the crisis that they had all expected for years. Twenty-four hours after the Soviet warning, Egypt's supreme commander, Field Marshal Amer, put the army on full alert for war. Lieutenant General Anwar al-Qadi, the chief of operations, told Amer that more than half of the army, including some of its best troops, was bogged down in Yemen; it was in no condition to fight Israel. Amer reassured him that fighting was not part of the plan; it was just a ""demonstration"" in response to Israel's threats to Syria. Two days later Egypt dug itself deeper into crisis. It expelled UN peacekeepers that had patrolled the border with Israel since 1956, and moved troops into the Sinai desert. UN peacekeepers in Sinai and Gaza were expelled by Egypt The Israeli army, still obsessed with Syria, was much more patient with Egypt at first. Shlomo Gazit, who was head of analysis in military intelligence, told American diplomats that Israel had been taken by surprise by Egypt's belligerency, but it was ""an elaborate charade"", that would only get serious if Egypt blockaded the port of Eilat on the Red Sea by closing the Straits of Tiran. The mood was whipped up by Nasser's ubiquitous radio station, Sawt al-Arab, the Voice of the Arabs. Broadcasting from Cairo to the rest of the Middle East, it was a vital tool of Nasser's foreign policy. Throughout the crisis, its chief announcer, Ahmed Said, read out a series of blood-curdling threats to Israel. The Israelis did not call Nasser's bluff when he threw out the UN peacekeepers and sent more troops into the Sinai. So he doubled the stakes. On 22 May, he banned Israeli shipping from the Straits of Tiran, the entrance to the Gulf of Aqaba, effectively re-imposing the blockade of the port of Eilat that had been lifted in 1956. At an airbase in the Sinai desert Nasser announced: ""If Israel wishes to threaten war, we tell her, you are welcome."" A photo shows Nasser, looking as debonair as ever, surrounded by happy young flyers. Smiles flashed across the grainy black and white still. The image Nasser desired was pumped around the world - the leader of the Arabs challenging the Jewish state, surrounded by the symbols of a modern fighting force - jet pilots - ready for action. Nasser looks excited, almost like a child intoxicated by the enormity of the line he had just crossed. Nasser pictured with Egyptian jet pilots at Bir Gifgafa air base in Sinai, 22 May 1967 The Americans responded 42 minutes after the announcement from Cairo, dangling the prospect of a visit by the US Vice-President Hubert Humphrey if the crisis was averted. President Lyndon Johnson was angry. The UN Secretary General U Thant was in the air, flying to Cairo on a peace mission when Nasser made his new threat. Nasser repeated the promise he had already made to the Americans and the Soviets, that Egypt would not fire the first shot. But U Thant concluded gloomily that unless a way could be found around the blockade of Eilat, war was certain. The day after Nasser closed the Straits, the Israeli prime minister, Levi Eshkol, and the cabinet ordered a full mobilisation. In 48 hours, 250,000 men could be put into the field. After compulsory military service, all Israeli men were allocated to a reserve unit. In a couple of days, most Israeli men under the age of 50 were in some sort of military uniform. The pressure was crushing General Rabin. Against all the military evidence, he had convinced himself that he was leading Israel to catastrophe. Rabin smoked pack after pack of cigarettes and eventually suffered a nervous collapse. He slept for nearly 24 hours, recovered himself, and went back to work. International diplomacy attempted to settle the crisis before it descended into full-scale war. Israel's foreign minister, Abba Eban, flew to Washington for an urgent meeting with President Johnson. In 1956, when Israel attacked Egypt as part of a secret agreement with Britain and France, the Americans branded Israel an aggressor, and forced it to pull out of the land it conquered. This time Eban wanted Johnson's consent for Israel's fight. The US president warned Israel not to fire the first shot. He told Eban not to worry about an Egyptian attack. It wasn't imminent and if it came ""you'll whip the hell out of them"". US President Lyndon B Johnson warned the Israelis not to fire the first shot Johnson indicated he would work on ways of getting the Straits of Tiran open, perhaps with a multinational naval task force, but wanted time to see if it could work. Abba Eban decided Israel would have to move at America's pace, but the army was ready to attack and the generals were getting frustrated. Eban irritated the military men. His overblown style and metropolitan ways got under their skin. The generals were furious when the cabinet agreed on 28 May to wait two weeks. For them it was about much more than the Straits of Tiran. What mattered was the big picture. Nasser was uniting the entire Arab world against them. He had moved divisions into the Sinai desert, making a direct threat to Israel's borders. Nasser had been the undisputed leader of the Arab world since 1956. Now standing up to the hated Israelis, his position among Arabs as a political idol was reinforced. He held a news conference with foreign journalists in Cairo on 28 May, in which he linked the crisis in the Sinai and the Straits of Tiran with Israel's ""aggression"" towards the Palestinians. Coexistence was not possible because Israel, he said, had robbed and expelled the Palestinians in 1948. Israel would also get what was coming for threatening ""to march on Damascus, occupy Syria and overthrow the Syrian Arab regime"". Nasser's confidence forced King Hussein of Jordan into a corner. Hussein did not trust Nasser. He confided in the CIA station chief in Amman, Jack O'Connel, who had become a close confidant, that he was convinced the West Bank was Israel's strategic target. Hussein's senior officers were pressing for closer co-ordination with Nasser. 30 May 1967: Hussein and Nasser smile after signing a Jordan-Egypt defence agreement For Hussein it all came down to survival. He decided on reconciliation with Nasser. He believed that if he stayed out of the war ""an eruption"" among his Palestinian subjects might cause his regime to collapse. If he fought, Egyptian air cover might delay Israel's advance into the West Bank long enough for the UN to impose a ceasefire. On 30 May, King Hussein flew to Cairo and did the deal. When he returned to Amman deliriously happy crowds tried to lift up his Mercedes so they could carry it back to the palace. Hussein was not deluded. The crowds loved him because Nasser had accepted him, not the other way around. Later he told the historian Avi Shlaim: ""I knew that war was inevitable. I knew that we were going to lose. I knew that we in Jordan were threatened, threatened by two things: we either followed the course we did, or alternatively the country could tear itself apart if we stayed out."" If they could fight on their own terms, Israel's generals were confident they would score an overwhelming victory. But strict military censorship kept those conclusions private. At the same time, bloody threats poured out of Arab radio stations and on to the pages of Israeli newspapers. Only 22 years after the end of the Holocaust it was not surprising that the Arab propaganda hit home. A doom-laden mood overcame the country. People made black jokes: ""Let's meet after the war. Where? In a phone box,"" alluding to how many Israelis might be left. Civil defence preparations in Tel Aviv, June 1967 The government stockpiled coffins; rabbis consecrated parks as emergency cemeteries; tens of thousands of pints of blood were donated. The mood was not helped when Prime Minister Levi Eshkol made a disastrous broadcast to the nation on 28 May. He stammered and fluffed his way through it. At a meeting afterwards Israel's generals gave him a vicious dressing-down. Among many interventions, Brig Gen Ariel Sharon raged ""we have removed our principal weapon, fear of us"". Several of the commanders used aggressive, highly pejorative language comparing the government to Jewish leaders in the diaspora who had been forced to beg like slaves. Native-born Israelis in the 1950s and 60s were brought up to reject what they assumed was the weakness and passivity of European Jews who did not fight when the Nazis came. To the young Israeli generals, mainly native-born, mostly in their 30s and 40s, Eshkol, who liked speaking Russian and Yiddish as much as Hebrew, seemed to embody the weakness of the diaspora. That was unfair - he had arrived in Palestine as a young man and had spent his life building the state. Israeli Prime Minister Levi Eshkol was mistrusted by younger Israeli generals Brig Gen Elad Peled, one of four divisional commanders, was at the meeting. Peled told me in 2002: ""The mental generation gap was very important. We were the cowboys, frontier people. We looked at the older generation as people who were not free, they were not liberatedâ¦ the minister of education asked me 'what if you're wrong? You're playing with the existence of the state.' I told him I am 100% confident about the result of the war."" Like many Israeli prime ministers, Eshkol was also minister of defence. He was forced to give the job up, in favour of one of Israel's war heroes, the swashbuckling, one-eyed general, Moshe Dayan. The soldier had stated his essential philosophy at the funeral of Ray Rothberg, who was killed at a kibbutz near Gaza in 1956. ""It is the fate of our generation that our life requires that we be always prepared and armed, strong and determined, for if the sword be struck from our grasp, we shall die."" Nasser was gambling for high stakes. Egypt had a modern air force but the army was weak. His generals were well-aware that Nasser's brinkmanship had taken them to the edge of a disastrous war. International attempts to defuse the crisis had failed. The only idea the Americans and the British had was the so-called Red Sea Regatta, the proposed naval task force that would force open the Straits of Tiran. But the US and British admirals and politicians hated the idea. They worried it might not work, and that they would be handing Nasser another victory. On Friday 2 June, Israel's generals put the definitive case for war to the cabinet defence committee. They told the politicians that they could beat Egypt, but the longer they had to wait the harder it would be. A few days earlier Meir Amit, the head of Israel's spy agency Mossad, had travelled to Washington DC on a false passport, in disguise. He did not want to wait longer for war; he was deeply concerned about the shutdown in the economy caused by the mobilisation of most of the male population under the age of 50. Amit told me in 2002 about a crucial meeting he had with the US defence secretary, Robert McNamara. ""I saidâ¦ 'I'm going to recommend a war'. ""McNamara asked only two questions. 'How long?' I said it would take a week. 'How many casualties?' I said less than the war of independence, which was 6,000. McNamara said 'I read you loud and clear'."" The Americans had given a clear signal. They had been told that Israel would be going to war and had made no attempt to stop it happening. Amit travelled back to Israel with the Washington ambassador, Abe Harman, on an aircraft full of gas masks. They arrived in Tel Aviv on the evening of Saturday 3 June. A car took them straight to Eshkol's apartment, where he was waiting with his key ministers. Amit wanted an immediate war. Harman wanted to wait another week or so. Dayan disagreed: ""If we wait for seven to nine days, there will be thousands dead. It's not logical to wait. Let's strike first and then look after the political side."" Everyone who was there had no doubt that the decision had been taken. Israel was going to war. The cabinet ratified it the next morning. In Egypt, Nasser predicted Israel would attack on 4 or 5 June. He based his observation on the progress of an Iraqi armoured division, which was heading towards the Jordan Valley and Israel. He knew Israel would not tolerate such a change in the balance of forces. By 07:40 on 5 June, Ezer Weizman could hardly stand the suspense in the Air Force command centre in the ministry of defence in Tel Aviv. The Israeli war plan depended on a surprise attack, called Operation Focus, which would destroy the Arab air forces on the ground, starting with Egypt. They had trained for it for years and the first wave of attacks was about to go in. This video can not be played Six Day War: What happened - in 60 seconds Unlike the Egyptians and the other Arab armies, the Israelis had done their homework. They had flown hundreds of reconnaissance missions over the years to build up an accurate picture of every airbase in Egypt, Jordan and Syria.  Pilots had a target book, giving the details of their layouts, call signs and defences. From radio intercepts they even built up voice-recognition files of the main Arab commanders. It was a huge success. Field Marshal Amer and the Egyptian top brass were meeting at Bir Tamada, an airbase in Sinai. They were just starting the meeting when the first Israeli jets started their bomb runs. One of the generals was so surprised by the attack that the first thing that flashed through his mind was a coup or some other kind of Egyptian betrayal. Amer's plane was able to take off but at one point had nowhere to land as every Egyptian airbase was under attack. In Tel Aviv, Ezer Weizman was ecstatic. The attacks were going better than expected. They had achieved complete surprise over the enemy. He phoned his wife: ""We've won the war,"" he shouted. Later in the day Israel destroyed most of the Jordanian and Syrian air forces. Israel controlled the skies, and after that it was matter of finishing the job. Egypt's air force was decimated by Israel's pre-emptive strike Israel warned King Hussein not to enter the war. But his mind was already made up, and he had put Jordan's efficient army under the command of a less than capable Egyptian general. Just before midday fighting started in Jerusalem. The Jordanians opened fire. King Hussein ignored Israeli signals that Jordan would be spared if it stayed out of the war. After the Samua raid in 1966 he didn't believe Israeli assurances; and he was convinced that if he reneged on the military alliance he had entered with Egypt he would lose his throne. Further south, Israeli ground forces had pushed into the Sinai desert, and were moving forward rapidly in three broad thrusts. The Egyptians fought bravely from fixed positions but unlike the Israelis had not been trained to improvise, or to be flexible or speedy. In the army headquarters in Cairo the commanders were increasingly gripped by panic. General Salahdeen Hadidi slumped in his chair, convinced that the war was at least half lost. It was worse than that for Egypt. But outside on the streets the people were celebrating. Crowds poured into the city by evening on buses provided by the ruling party. Voice of the Arabs was their trusted source of news and truth, and it was pushing out fantasy. By 20:17 it was reporting that 86 Israeli aircraft had been destroyed and that Egyptian tanks had broken into Israel. At the headquarters of the Sinai front, General Mohamed Abdel Ghani Gamasy listened ""with growing horror"" to what he knew was a pack of nonsense. Years later I asked Ahmed Said why he had told outright lies on air. In his crumbling, once-grand apartment overlooking the Nile, he defended himself. 5 June: Egyptian warplanes destroyed on the tarmac ""You're asking people to fight, not danceâ¦ we believed the broadcasts were our most powerful weaponâ¦ many of our listeners were illiterate, so radio was the most important way to reach them."" Back in 1967, as real news of the defeats came through, Nasser and Amer had retreated to their villas. Anwar Sadat, who later as president made a historic peace deal with Israel and was assassinated by his own guards as a result, went for a long walk through the streets of Cairo. ""Dazed and broken-hearted"" he watched Nasser loyalists marching up and down the main avenue leading to the pyramids, chanting and dancing to fake reports of an imaginary victory. In the five days that followed Israel routed the armies of Egypt, Jordan and Syria. It captured the Gaza Strip and the Sinai desert from Egypt; the Golan Heights from Syria; and the West Bank and East Jerusalem, from Jordan. For the first time in almost two millennia the Jewish holy places in Jerusalem were under the control of Jews. More Palestinians were expelled, fled or were killed, though not on the scale of 1948. 7 June: Israeli soldiers approach the Dome of the Rock in East Jerusalem Nasser resigned, but changed his mind after millions went out into the streets to mourn and protest. He stayed in the job until his death in 1970. Field Marshal Amir died in mysterious circumstances. His family was convinced he was poisoned. King Hussein of Jordan lost East Jerusalem but kept his throne. He continued his secret dialogue with Israel and made peace in 1994. In Syria, the air force commander who had been in the ruling junta seized sole power in 1970. His name was Hafez al-Assad. His son, Bashar, succeeded him as president on his death in 2000. In Israel, Prime Minister Eshkol died of a heart attack in 1969. His widow, Miriam, believed that he had never recovered from being forced out of the ministry of defence on the eve of war. Eshkol's successor, Golda Meir, was warned in 1973 that Egypt and Syria were preparing a surprise attack. But the Israelis were still suffering from hubris after the crushing defeat they had inflicted in 1967. In the war that followed Israel was saved by a massive airlift of supplies from the United States. Egypt believed it had redeemed its national honour, and its president, Anwar Sadat, followed through with his historic overture for peace. After 1967 the Americans looked at Israel with new eyes. It fell in love with the young sabras who had beaten three Arab armies. The 1967 war changed many people's perception of Israel and its armed forces Like most Westerners in 1967, President Johnson's envoy Harry McPherson was deeply impressed. ""Israel at war destroys the prototype of the pale, scrawny Jew; the soldiers I saw were tough, muscular and sunburned. There is also an extraordinary combination of discipline and democracy among officers and enlisted men; the latter rarely salute and frequently argue, but there is no doubt about who will prevail."" Israel and the Palestinians felt the biggest consequences of the 1967 war. Israel began an occupation of the Palestinian territories that continues half a century later. It annexed East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in moves not recognised internationally. A 25-year-old Israeli soldier back from the war told his comrades: ""We've lost something terribly precious. We've lost our little country."" Israeli occupation replaced Jordanian occupation in the West Bank All the issues that are now depressingly familiar to anyone who follows the news - violence, occupation, settlements, the future of Jerusalem - took their current form as a result of the war. The shape of the occupation emerged very quickly. Predictions of the dangers that lay ahead were ignored. Just after the war ended, David Ben Gurion, Israel's first prime minister, warned against the seductive charms of victory. In a speech at Beit Berl, the think tank of the Israeli Left, he said that staying in the territories would distort the Jewish state and might even destroy it. Israel must keep Jerusalem, but everything else must go back to the Arabs, with or without a peace deal. Abba Eban, the foreign minister, saw maps that showed Israel stretching from the Golan to Suez and along the entire length of the River Jordan not as a ""guarantee of peace but an invitation to early war"". Israeli tanks in action on the Golan Heights But the mood in Israel blew away any suggestion of caution as decisively as the Israeli army had dealt with the Arabs. In just under a week of war the Israeli public went from despair to the joy of deliverance. Religious Jews believed that the victory was a miracle that had been given to them by God. Secular Israelis felt the electricity of the moment. Hanan Porat, a paratrooper who went on to become a leader of the settlement movement, never forgot the sight of his secular comrades weeping at the Western Wall, a remnant from the time of the second Jewish Temple, in East Jerusalem, a few minutes after they captured it. ""I had a sense that here in Jerusalem the inner truth of the Jewish nation was revealed. It was a miracle because the truth of the Bible was combined with the truth of life. An electric current ran right through the people of Israel."" Israeli paratroopers at the newly captured Western Wall - the image became iconic for Jews around the world The teaching of Rabbi Zvi Yehuda Kook inspired many of the settlers, including Porat. A leader of religious Zionism, Kook taught that the Israeli armed forces had done God's work. ""The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] is total sanctity. It represents the rule of the people of the Lord over His land."" It followed that land gifted to the Jewish people by a miracle from God could not be given up. The difficulty they faced was that Palestinians believed it was their land, and their duty to protect the holy places they venerated. President Johnson's Middle East adviser Bob Anderson warned a month after the war that Jerusalem had a special significance for Arabs. ""The Old City of Jerusalem is capable of stirring mobs in the streets to the point where the fate of our most moderate friends in the Middle East will be in jeopardy and the basis laid for a later holy war."" Some Israelis thought they might be able to trade some of the captured territory for peace, though not East Jerusalem which was enlarged with the addition of a band of territory from the West Bank and then annexed. At a summit in Khartoum at the end of August, Arab states were in no mood to go cap in the hand to the country that had humiliated them, again. Arab leaders said there would be no negotiations, no recognition and no peace with Israel. Paradoxically, defeat in 1967 helped kick start the Palestinian national movement. Before then the Palestine Liberation Organisation had been a puppet of Nasser, a way of containing the Palestinians rather than helping their fight for independence. After 1967 Yasser Arafat and his Fatah faction took matters into their own hands. After several dozen Fatah hit and run raids in only three months in 1968, the Israelis mounted a reprisal raid on the group's headquarters in Karameh refugee camp in Jordan. Members of Fatah on parade in the Jordanian capital, Amman, in August 1970 They ran into unexpected opposition from Palestinian guerrillas and Jordanian artillery. The Israelis destroyed Karameh in the end, but only after hours of street fighting that cost them at least 30 dead. Over 100 Fatah fighters were killed, and were celebrated as national heroes.  Arafat became chairman of the moribund PLO, and an international figure, the symbol of national liberation for Palestinians, the world's worst terrorist for Israelis. Yitzhak Rabinserved two terms as Israeli prime minister, firstly in the mid-1970s, and later between 1992-1995; in his second term of office he negotiated and signed historic Oslo peace accords with the Palestinians, for which he shared a Nobel Peace prize; he was assassinated by an ultra-nationalist Israeli Jew in Tel Aviv in 1995 King Hussein of Jordanordered the expulsion of PLO forces from Jordan in 1970 and rejected calls by Egypt and Syria to join their war against Israel in 1973. After years of secret talks, Jordan signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994. Hussein died in 1999 Hafez al-Assadtook power in a 1970 coup and was elected Syrian president in a referendum a year later; he ruled the country until he died in 2000. Relations with Israel remained hostile - there was an unsuccessful attempt to take back the Golan Heights in the 1973 Middle East war, and Assad continued to refuse any peace deal which did not include the return of Syrian territory Gamal Abdel Nasserdied of a heart attack in 1970; his successor, Anwar Sadat, eventually sought peace with Israel, signing an historic treaty in 1979; he wasassassinated by an Egyptian officer in 1981. The 1967 war made Israel into an occupier, which is why more than anything else it matters. The experience has been a disaster for Israelis and Palestinians. Israel built settlements for Jews, in defiance of international law that says occupiers cannot settle their people on the land they capture. Israel, though, sees it differently. Abba Eban predicted that Palestinians would not lose their ""taste for flags, honour, pride and independence."" Military occupation is by definition oppressive. The occupation has created a culture of violence that cheapens life and brutalises the people who impose and enforce the occupation and those who fight it. The ramifications of the war are still felt, 50 years on Peace negotiations started in the early 1990s to try to unwind the consequences of the 1967 war. Yitzhak Rabin, by then prime minister, shook hands with his old enemy Yasser Arafat under the gaze of a beaming President Clinton on the lawn of the White House in 1993. The peace process was flawed from the start for both sides. But it was all they had.  Extreme Israeli right-wingers took it seriously; they believed it threatened their dream of controlling all the land that God had given to the Jewish people. A Jewish extremist assassinated Rabin in Tel Aviv in 1995. His killer was so pleased that he had killed a man he saw as a traitor and a threat to Jews that during his first interrogation he picked up a cup to toast his success. Rabin was the necessary man for Israelis; they trusted him with their security. That was why he was killed. The peace process might have failed with Rabin. But without the man who had prepared and led the army to victory in 1967, and with Palestinian violence against Israelis rising in the unstable years after the assassination, peace did not have a chance. Fifty years on from 1967, President Trump - like many new American presidents - is hoping to help Israelis and Palestinians make peace. If his dreams become substantive talks, they will have to be about the future of the land that was captured in six days of war. It was an extraordinary human drama, which swept up a generation of Israelis and Arabs whose children and grandchildren still cannot live peacefully in the world the war created. The Holy Land, with Jerusalem at its heart, is a place where the great tectonic plates of religion, culture and nationalism come together. The fault lines that run between them are never quiet and always dangerous. Ignoring the legacy of 1967 is not an option. Â© 2025 BBC.

"BÃ©atrice Huret stood on a beach on the northern French coast before dawn, watching as her lover headed off across the English Channel in a rickety boat. Would she ever see him again? Had she been taken for a ride, used by a man she met just a few weeks earlier to help him fulfil his dream of a new life in England? Would he drown on the way? As the boat disappeared over the dark horizon, BÃ©atrice returned to her car, her head full of hope but also full of doubt. The 45-year-old had just a couple years previously been a card-carrying member of the far-right National Front (FN), and she was the widow of a policeman who she says was racist. Now here she was helping her migrant lover, Mokhtar, whom she had met in the so-called Jungle migrant camp in Calais, to sneak into Britain. She recounts the story of how her life changed the day she offered a lift to a teenage migrant in a new book titled Calais Mon Amour. BÃ©atrice says that before his death from cancer in 2010 her husband had been one of the huge number of police officers deployed in Calais to keep migrants from breaking into the Channel Tunnel terminal or the ferry port, in their bid to get to the UK. As a policeman he was not legally allowed to join a political party, so he got his wife to sign up instead to Marine Le Pen's FN, which paid her to distribute pamphlets. She says that, unlike her husband, she was not really racist. But she admits she was worried about ""all these foreigners, who seemed so different, and who were getting into France"". BÃ©atrice lived with her teenage son and her mother about 20km (12 miles) from the Jungle, but she had never seen the giant shantytown built of tents and shacks on waste ground on the outskirts of Calais. On her way home from work one very cold day in 2015, she took pity on a Sudanese boy and agreed to drop him off at the camp, which at its peak last year was home to 10,000 people, most of whom had fled war or poverty in Africa, the Middle East, or Afghanistan. Then, for the first time, she saw for herself what conditions there were like. ""I felt as though I was in a war zone, it was like a war camp, a refugee camp, and something went 'click' and I said to myself that I just had to help,"" she says. Suddenly migrants were no longer just a word, no longer an abstraction. BÃ©atrice, who works at a centre where young people are trained to become carers, started to bring food and clothing to people in the Jungle, roping in friends and family members to help. Slowly she got to know the camp and its people, ranging ""from shepherds to lawyers to surgeons"". Then, in February last year, she laid eyes on Mokhtar, a 34-year-old former teacher who had had to flee his native Iran, where he faced persecution, and was ostracised by his own family for having converted to Christianity. She met him just at the moment when photos of him, and of several of his compatriots, were being published in newspapers around the world, because they had sewn their lips together in protest at the appalling living conditions in the Jungle. ""I sat down and then he came over and very gently he asked me if I would like a cup of tea, and then he went and made me tea, and it was a bit of a shock. It was love at first sight,"" she says. ""It was just his look, it was so soft. There they were with their lips sewn up and they ask me, do I want some tea?"" But communication was an obstacle, as Mokhtar spoke no French and she, unlike him, had little English. Their solution was to use Google Translate. A romance blossomed and BÃ©atrice offered to put up Mokhtar and some of his friends in her house, ignoring advice from her friends that she was making a big mistake. She was under no illusions about her new lover's goal. Mokhtar had already tried to get to England by hiding in the back of lorries and now he was about to try a change of tack. He and two friends gave BÃ©atrice about 1,000 euros (Â£980; $1,130) and got her to buy a small boat for them. On 11 June last year, BÃ©atrice towed it to a beach near Dunkirk, and the trio of migrants, none of whom had been in charge of a boat before, set off at about 04:00 on a perilous journey across the world's busiest shipping channel. ""We dressed them up so they would look like men out on a fishing trip, with fishing rods,"" she says with a smile. That was the moment when the whole thing might have ended, when BÃ©atrice hoped for the best but worried that she might have been had, and worried that Mokhtar and his friends might even drown. That very nearly came to pass, when the boat started taking water around 06:30, as it approached the English coast. It was terrifying, but with hindsight there was something comic about it. ""The youngest was vomiting from fear, the toughest one was smoking cigarettes and saying 'Well, if you have to die, you have to die, that's life,' and there was Mokhtar scooping out the water and phoning the emergency services at the same time,"" she says. The British coastguard sent out a helicopter which eventually spotted them and sent a boat out to the rescue. The three migrants were later questioned by immigration officers, and after a couple of days Mokhtar was sent to an asylum centre from where he could finally contact his beloved, who had been waiting anxiously on the other side of the Channel. ""He gave his address in Wakefield. I went to see him the next weekend,"" BÃ©atrice says. And ever since then she has taken a ferry every second week and driven up to see her lover, who is now in a refugee hostel in Sheffield and who has successfully applied for asylum in the UK. They keep in touch via webcam nearly every night. So what of the future? The couple have no plans, BÃ©atrice says, noting that ""it hurts when you make plans that don't work out"". ""If our relationship ends, then so be it [but] I owe Mokhtar a beautiful love story, the most beautiful one of my life."" Syrian migrant: 'I nearly drowned in chocolate' Twenty-four hours in a fuel tank The special shoes The story for her does not end on a purely happy note. Last August she was arrested and charged with people smuggling. She laughs when she speaks of the charge, as for her the idea that she was in it for the money is nothing short of ridiculous. She was taken into custody at the same police station where her late husband used to work. Released on bail, she was placed under judicial supervision, and has to report to police once a week, as she waits for her trial to begin later this month. If found guilty, she could in theory be sentenced to 10 years in prison and fined 750,000 euros, though in her case the penalty would probably be less severe. BÃ©atrice has also been put on the government watchlist of people who are deemed a potential threat to the security of the state. Most people on this list are radical Islamists. This too makes her laugh. Was it all worth it? ""Yes,"" she replied without hesitation. ""I did it for him. You do anything for love.""

"There's no question that Margaret Court is one of the greatest players in tennis history. But what is being questioned are her comments against the country's LGBT community. They have triggered a debate on whether she still deserves to have her name adorning the country's most famous tennis arena. Court has won more Grand Slam tournaments than any other player. But her career post-tennis has seen her become a Christian minister and one of a particularly conservative brand. What is it all about? Australia's Margaret Court is the world's most successful female tennis star. And so it seems only appropriate that the country's most famous tennis arena is named after her. Margaret Court won 11 Australian Open singles titles But the now 74-year-old is embroiled in controversy. She's a Christian pastor, vehemently opposed to same-sex marriage. The row started when she wrote anopen letter to Qantas last month,external, criticising the airline for its support of same-sex marriage. She said she would boycott Qantas and in subsequent interviews on the issue has added more fuel to the fire with statements suggesting that transgender children were the work of ""the devil"" and that tennis was ""full of lesbians"". This has led to growing calls the court should be renamed. Most notably, fellow former tennis legends Martina Navratilova and Billie Jean King, who are both gay, have criticised Court and called for the arena to be renamed. Navratilova was among the first players to call for a new name for the Margaret Court Arena ""Her vitriol is not just an opinion,"" Navratilova wrote in an open letter. ""She is actively trying to keep LGBT people from getting equal rights (note to Court: we are human beings, too)."" Is it hate speech? Some commentators,externalhave accused Court ofspreading hate speech,external. Navratilova in her letter wrote that the former champion was ""demonising trans kids and trans adults everywhere"". Here's what's probably the most controversial quote by Court, claiming there was an LGBT agenda to get into the minds of children. ""That's what Hitler did. That's what communism did. There's a whole plot in our nation and in the nations of the world to get in the minds of the children,"" she said on Christian talk radio. Strong words, but from a legal perspective, things are not that easy. The legal framework focuses on anti-discrimination provisions and protections against inciting violence, says Dr Mark Williams, lawyer and adjunct professor at the School of Art at RMIT University Melbourne. A mere statement on a group of a certain sexual orientation is not in itself a legal matter, he explains. For a statement to become relevant from a legal perspective, it would have to include a call to action to either discriminate against a certain group or it would have to be a statement seen as inciting violence. Who says what on the issue? Australia's official tennis body says there's no need to rename the court. The Australian Open venue was named after the 11-time winner in 2003, and Tennis Australia has so far maintained that Court's views are her own and the name will not be changed. Andy Murray urged the matter to be resolved soon The prime minister's take? Malcolm Turnbull is also for keeping things as they are. ""Whatever people may think about Margaret Court's views about gay marriageâ¦ she is one of the all-time greats and the Margaret Court Arena celebrates Margaret Court the tennis player,"" he told 3AW radio. ""She's one of the greatest greats of tennis and that's why the arena is named after her."" Current men's number one Andy Murray has also weighed in on the topic. Murray left no doubt he disagrees with Court's views. ""I don't see why anyone has a problem with two people who love each other getting married,"" he said during the French Open. ""It's not anyone else's business."" He's been more coy though about whether or not to rename the court, simply saying the matter has to be resolved soon - before the Australian Open in January 2018. ""That's all the devil,"" Court said about transgender children The latest voice to come out on issues is fellow tennis legend John McEnroe who in avideo message,externalover the weekend strongly criticised Court for her views. He then suggested tongue in cheek the name should be kept and ""when same-sex marriage finally becomes legal in Australia, I will personally call my good friend Elton John to host the biggest same-sex mass wedding ceremony ever seen - in the Margaret Court Arena"".

"In an age where you can email from your phone or catch up on TV while waiting for a bus, one village has remained in the ""dark ages"" with no mobile phone or broadband internet. But Staylittle in Powys finally has a permanent mobile phone mast - which residents say will be life-changing. When mother-of-two Becky Williams moved to the remote Welsh village it was a dream come true. She moved to an idyllic small-holding from the Midlands with her husband. But she was not prepared for the complications which came with the move five years ago. That is because Staylittle, near Newtown, had no mobile connectivity or broadband internet. The village cut off from the UK She said: ""We live in a stunning, beautiful place but it was in the dark ages. It was a complete nightmare having no mobile signal, and even worse when the landline went down too. ""In the midlands we had broadband and mobile coverage everywhere, but here we have never had mobile signal."" It may sound trivial, but for Mrs Williams, who has two young children and a husband who works abroad half the year, it was isolating. Staylittle - Penffordd Las in Welsh - is remote, with the nearest market town almost eight miles (12km) away. Becky Williams has run an internet business from home despite having no connection herself Some who live in the village had no mobile phone or reliable internet connection, making life complicated for its 140 residents. For three weeks in 2015 thelandline connection went down as wellwhen the BT line was damaged, leaving residents totally isolated. When Mrs Williams bought an online designer children's clothing business last year she would drive to a spot a 10 minutes from the village to check her phone messages twice a day, and while at home relied on slow and expensive satellite internet. ""I had to drive down to my mother's house in town to work every day,"" said Mrs Williams. ""I have got a one-year-old son and it was a complete pain having to cart him down to my mother's and do all my business through emails. ""Our six-year-old daughter, Lilly, likes horse-riding and I used to worry so much about her having an accident and the lines being down, as how would I have contacted somebody?"" But last month, a permanent 4G mast was finally installed on a hill overlooking the village - giving mobile coverage across Staylittle. Mrs Williams said: ""Now I work from home, which has been amazing. I'm going to be able do online shopping, which I couldn't do before because the satellite connection would go down in the middle of my shop."" Staylittle now has its first permanent 4G phone mast David Penn, 74, said house sales had fallen through in the village once potential buyers realised there was no broadband connection. ""It is one of the utilities people expect now, along with electricity and gas,"" said Mr Penn. ""Every single organisation under the sun assumes you are online now - if I want to find out about a special offer or sign up for something it has to be done on the internet. ""Instead all we had was a phone line which we had to share between a number of houses - you could hear your neighbour talking on the line sometimes. On other occasions I would be talking to my 98-year-old mother and then the line would go dead as someone from another house started dialling."" Mr Penn is secretary of the Staylittle Community Association, which has been campaigning for the village to have a broadband internet for the last three years. He said there have been previous failed attempts to get the village online, including one by a BBC programme the Big Life Fix. ""The landline connection itself is unreliable,"" said Mr Penn. ""We have been very lucky that there hasn't been any real emergencies in that time, but since the mast has been put up two people have had strokes and there has been an broken ankle so there have been some 999 calls."" David Penn said residents have become frustrated with the ""unreliable"" landline service O2, which installed the mast in the village, said it will be erecting 4G masts at a further 395 Welsh villages by the end of the year. But despite Staylittle's access Mr Penn admitted he was yet to get online. ""I'm still not quite sure how I get my computer connected to the internet,"" said Mr Penn. ""I know some people have managed it, but it is an 120-mile round trip to the nearest O2 shop from here to get the bits and pieces I need, so I will get around to it at some point. ""Those who are connected are are holding on to their BT landlines for the moment as they are worried it is too good to be true.""

"A view of the capital Doha The sovereign state of Qatar is currently at the centre of a storm, with itsneighbours cutting off diplomatic relations. But this is not a country which often finds itself dominating the headlines. So what do people actually know about Qatar, apart from it hosting the football World Cup in 2022? Here are five facts to get you started. In a country of about 2.5 million people, there are fewer than 700,000 women. This imbalance can be attributed to Qatar's sudden population explosion: this is a state built by immigrants, who are overwhelmingly young and male. The promise of a job has meant people have flooded into Qatar - which is about the same size as Yorkshire - in recent years, taking its population from less than 700,000 in 2003, to an estimated 2.5 million in 2016. While there are female migrants, the vast majority are men building the infrastructure needed for the upcoming World Cup. They come from all over the world, although the largest numbers come from India and Nepal, making Hindus the third largest religious group in the country, after Muslims and Christians, according tothe CIA's World Factbook,external. However, despite the promise of work and a better future, several reports in recent years have said migrants are being forced to work in appalling conditions, with more than half still living in labour camps around the country. Qatar has promised to improve life for its workers, butAmnesty International's report for 2016/17,externalsaid they  ""continued to face exploitation and abuse"". Qatar has been busy over the last decade or so buying up large swathes of London. Its portfolio includes, but is not limited to, the Shard, Harrods, Chelsea Barracks and the Olympic Village, as well having a stake in Canary Wharf. Qatari investment funds own 95% of The Shard Ali Shareef al-Emadi, the country's finance minister,told the BBCin March he estimated the country had ""more than Â£35bn to Â£40bn ($45bn to $51bn) of investments already in the UK"". What's more, Mr Emadi said the country was planning to invest another Â£5bn in the UK over the next three to five years - including more property. Qatar is known as a conservative country, yet, in the last few years it has sponsored a number of exhibitions - including hosting the somewhat controversial artist Damien Hirst's first solo retrospective in the Middle East, in 2013. The same year Sheikha al-Mayassa bint Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani - the sister of the emir, and head of Qatar Museums Authority - topped the Art Review's Power 100. Read more:Qatar's influence over the art world At one time, it was rumoured she was spending up to $1bn a year on art, with work from Andy Warhol, Mark Rothko, Paul Gauguin and Paul CÃ©zanne all making their way into the collection. The country also boasts the Museum of Islamic Art in Doha, which opened in 2008. It is said to house one of the most comprehensive collections of Islamic art in the world, exhibiting works from across three continents and 1,400 years. Qatar's love of art has spilled over from the museums and into its public spaces. Indeed, anyone who has ever been through Doha's Hamad International Airport could not have missed the 23-foot yellow teddy sitting in the middle of the terminal. Lamp/Bear was created by Swiss artist Urs Fischer more than a decade ago, is cast from bronze and weighs almost 20 tonnes. Lamp/Bear is one of the more remarkable parts of Doha's Hamad International Airport According to Hamad International Airport's official description, the bear is a ""playful piece that humanises the space around it and reminds travellers of childhood or precious objects from home"". But this playful piece did not come cheap: the cast bronze sculpture was bought at auction in New York for $6.8m (Â£5.3m) back in 2011. How does such a small country pay for all this? Well, thanks to its oil and gas reserves, as well as some good investments, Qatar has the highest GDP per capita in the world. In 2016, it was $129,700 (Â£100,500) - more than $20,000 higher than the next closest country, Luxembourg,the CIA's World Factbook said.,external At the other end of the scale, Somalia's GDP was estimated to be just $400 per head. However, Qatar's wealth is in no way equally spread. The former Emir, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, is reportedly worth $2.4bn.  Butmigrants interviewed by the BBCin 2015 revealed they were earning as little as $350 a month. Have 1,200 World Cup workers really died in Qatar?

"This video can not be played Donald Trump challenged London Mayor Sadiq Khan to an IQ test US President Donald Trump has again lashed out at London Mayor Sadiq Khan over his assurances to Londoners following Saturday's terror attack. He accused Mr Khan of offering a ""pathetic excuse"" for saying there was no reason for people to be alarmed. Mr Khan had in fact said people should not be alarmed by an increased police presence. After a vigil for the victims of the attack, Mr Khan said he would not allow Mr Trump to ""divide our communities"". Seven people were killed and 48 others injured in the attack on Saturday. Mr Trump took issue with Mr Khan's statement in the aftermath of the attack, when the mayor said: ""Londoners will see an increased police presence today and over the course of the next few days. No reason to be alarmed."" The US president responded: ""At least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is 'no reason to be alarmed!'"" He followed this up with another tweet on Monday, saying: ""Pathetic excuse by London Mayor Sadiq Khan who had to think fast on his ""no reason to be alarmed"" statement. MSM [mainstream media] is working hard to sell it!"" The mayor's spokesman earlier made clear that he was telling Londoners not to be worried about the increased presence of armed police officers in the city. Is Trump's thin skin to blame? A skateboard, a crate: How London fought back This video can not be played Sadiq Khan: 'This is our city, these are our values and this is our way of life'. Speaking to the BBC after the vigil, Mr Khan said: ""We've got to recognise that some people want to divide our communities, some people thrive on fuelling division. ""That's not me, that's not the London  I know, and we aren't going to allow anybody, whether it's Donald Trump or anybody else to divide our community."" His spokesperson earlier said he ""has more important things to do than respond to Donald Trump's ill-informed tweet that deliberately takes out of context"" the mayor's remarks. Mr Trump's attacks on Mr Khan have drawn condemnation from both sides of the Atlantic. His critics have accused him of being insensitive and twisting the mayor's words. Politicians in the UK on Monday called on the prime minister to withdraw the invitation for Mr Trump's state visit later this year. The leader of the Liberal Democrats, Tim Farron, said: ""This is a man insulting our national values at a time of introspection and mourning."" Over the weekend, Prime Minister Theresa May refused to criticise Mr Trump, simply saying that Mr Khan was doing a ""good job"". British voters go to the polls on Thursday in a general election. ""Try to imagine the UK prime minister attacking the Mayor of NYC the day after 9/11,"" said European Parliament cabinet member Simon O'Connor. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio was quick to defend Mr Khan, praising him for ""doing exactly the right thing"". ""I don't understand why Donald Trump is trying to undermine a man who's trying to protect the people of London. It makes no sense,"" Mr de Blasio told the BBC's Nick Bryant during a press conference in New York on Monday.Trump renews feud with mayor of London This video can not be played New York mayor on his London counterpart: ""He deserves support, not efforts to undermine him"" The US Conference of Mayors, representing more than 1,400 American cities, backed Mr Khan. ""He has risen above this crisis of death and destruction, as mayors continue to do, to alleviate fear, to bring comfort to his people of London,"" the mayorswrote in a statement on Sunday,external. Mr Khan, a Muslim, has previously criticised the president's plans to temporarily restrict travel to the US from six mainly Muslim countries. After Mr Trump as a presidential candidate announced his plan, Mr Khan told the BBC he hoped he would""lose badly"", adding that he was a ""buffoon"". He also called Mr Trump's views on Islam ""ignorant"", leading the New York billionaire tochallenge him to an IQ test. In the wake of the London attack, Mr Trump has been tweeting about his stalled travel ban. This video can not be played Sadiq Khan: ""[Donald Trump's] views are divisive, they're outrageous and I hope he loses - badly"" Federal courts struck down the first proposal in January. The administration replaced it with a less stringent version order in March, but that also ended up in limbo after legal defeats. On Monday, the president attacked the Justice Department for revising the original measure, leaving it ""watered down"" and ""politically correct"". The Trump administration is expected to take the proposal to the Supreme Court next week. He argues the measure is needed to prevent attacks in the US, but critics say the policy is discriminatory and has little national security justification. Trump challenges Khan to IQ test.

"Christine Archibald was the first victim to be named after Saturday's attack on London Bridge A Canadian woman who was killed in the London terror attack died in her fiancÃ©'s arms after being struck by the speeding van, her family has said. Christine Archibald, 30, a former homeless shelter worker, is the first victim to be named after Saturday'sattack at London Bridge. Her family asked people to donate money or their time to a shelter, saying: ""Tell them Chrissy sent you."" Canadian PM Justin Trudeau said he was ""heartbroken"" at Ms Archibald's death. Three attackers were shot dead by police after driving a van into pedestrians on the bridge, before going on to stab people in Borough Market. The attack left seven people dead and 48 injured. Of the 36 people still being treated in hospital, 18 remain in a critical condition. In a statement, Ms Archibald's family said they had lost a ""beautiful, loving daughter and sister"". ""She had room in her heart for everyone and believed strongly that every person was to be valued and respected,"" they said. ""She would have had no understanding of the callous cruelty that caused her death."" They said Ms Archibald, from British Columbia, had worked in a shelter for the homeless until she moved to Europe to be with her fiancÃ©, Tyler Ferguson. ""Please honour her by making your community a better place. ""Volunteer your time and labour or donate to a homeless shelter. Tell them Chrissy sent you,"" the statement added. Floral tributes are being laid for the victims of the attack in London Bridge Mr Ferguson's sister, Cassie Ferguson Rowe, said her brother held Ms Archibald as she died in his arms. Writing on Facebook, she said: ""Last night in London my baby brother lost the love of his life on the London Bridge. ""In a split second his entire life was ripped away from him. Hearing his painful sobs on the phone while he's alone trying to deal with this tears me apart. ""I have no words. If you know Tyler, please be there for him now, and later when what happened sinks in, he's going to need us all."" Mr Trudeau said Canadians ""stand united with the British people"". ""We will continue to work together with the United Kingdom and all our allies to fight terrorism and bring perpetrators to justice,"" he said.

"Jeremy Corbyn has said Theresa May should pay a price in Thursday's general election for ignoring ""repeated warnings"" not to cut police numbers. The Labour leader said Mrs May had ""presided"" over a 19,000 fall in numbers as home secretary and he agreed with those calling on her to resign in the wake of the London Bridge attacks. But the PM said she had protected counter-terror police numbers. And she accused the Labour leader of opposing shoot-to-kill powers. With less than 72 hours to go before Thursday's election, party leaders have returned to the campaign trail after electioneering was briefly suspended because of the London Bridge attack, in which seven people died. BBC Election Live: Rolling updates Guide: Where the parties stand on security Police 'know identity of London attackers' How has armed policing changed? How terror attack will influence campaign Following a meeting of senior ministers and security chiefs at the emergency Cobra committee, Mrs May said Saturday's atrocity was an attack on ""the free world"" and said she was best equipped to deal with the ""evolving"" threat facing the UK. In a speech in London, she vowed to tackle the ""whole spectrum"" of extremism, promising action in communities and online to ensure ""bigotry and hatred"" did not escalate into violence. This video can not be played Culture secretary Karen Bradley says police funding was part of ""difficult decisions"" made by government She defended her record on security over the past seven years in the face of criticism that she had presided, as home secretary, over a fall of 18,991 in police numbers between September 2010 and 2016 and that she had accused officers of ""crying wolf"" over their capabilities. She said she had protected counter-terror police budgets as home secretary and was now ""providing funding for an uplift in the number of armed officers"" as well as protecting funding for the police as a whole. Insisting strong leadership was ""absolutely vital"" for keeping the UK safe, she said Mr Corbyn had ""boasted"" of opposing all counter-terrorism legislation as a backbench MP and had voiced his opposition to shoot-to-kill powers, saying the rapid response of the police to Saturday's attack showed how vital these were. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn backs calls for Theresa May to resign But as he embarked on a whirlwind series of campaign events planned for the next 72 hours, Mr Corbyn said there was ""deep anger"" at the number of police and firefighters who had lost their jobs in recent years. Asked whether he agreed with a call by some, including former Downing Street adviser Steve Hilton, for Mrs May to quit, he said he did, but added that the ""best way"" for the issue to be dealt with was by voters on Thursday. ""There is an election, everybody has a choice. A lot of people are very angry and would have wanted her to resign were she still home secretary. ""The choice is going to be made on Thursday by the people of this country."" Analysis -BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg Voters choose their political parties for all sorts of different reasons. But as this strange election hurtles towards its close, the demand of who can keep the country safe is firmly on the table. For Theresa May that doesn't just mean questions over how she would counter extremism if she stays in power. She faces criticism too over the Tories' record on squeezing money for the police. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has repeated his promise to reverse the cuts and slammed the Tories, warning the government could not ""protect the public on the cheap"". He also tried to counter perceptions that he is soft on security, including his earlier stance on shoot-to-kill, which he questioned days after the Paris attack at the Bataclan. He said, if he were prime minister he would take ""whatever action is necessary and effective"" to protect the public. After a brief pause, the election campaign is well and truly back, even if with a more subdued tone, and with security as its primary subject. Read more from Laura Lib Dem leader Tim Farron has accused the Conservatives of making the ""wrong choices"" over police budgets, ""posturing"" over internet surveillance powers and not putting enough pressure on allies in the Middle East to turn the screw on extremist groups. ""Fewer police on the beat means fewer conversations, less information being passed on and less knowledge about who's who and who needs to be kept under surveillance,"" he wrote in an articlefor the Guardian,external. Reality Check: What has happened to police numbers? Leaders' records on anti-terror legislation How has armed policing changed? He added: ""Theresa May talks of the need to have some difficult and sometimes embarrassing conversations. ""That should include exposing and rooting out the source of funding terror, even if it means difficult and embarrassing conversations with those like Saudia Arabia that the government claims are our allies."" He also warned about the UK seeking to ""control"" the internet in a manner associated with regimes like North Korea after the PM called for new measures to ""regulate cyberspace"" in order to prevent vulnerable people being radicalised online. This video can not be played Corbyn: I've not changed mind on shoot-to-kill This video can not be played Prime Minister Theresa May: ""Enough is enough' Culture Secretary Karen Bradley told the BBC that the fight against online radicalisation meant getting ""access to information as required"" from tech firms. Pressed on whether this meant penetrating encrypted messaging services, she said the tech industry had done the ""right thing"" in the past in terms of removing indecent images from their platforms and now ministers wanted the ""same response"" over extremist material. PM's condemnation of tech firms criticised Guide: The parties, the leaders, the manifestos ""We know it can be done and the internet companies want to do it,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today. UKIP leader Paul Nuttall has repeated his call for British citizens who travel to Syria or other countries to fight for so-called Islamic State to have their passports revoked and not allowed back into the country. SNP leader and Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon has sought to contrast the party's record in government with that of Mrs May's, saying police numbers had remained at least 1,000 higher than those it inherited in 2007. ""We're not immune from these threats, but unlike other parts of the UK we have also maintained police numbers and increased armed policing,"" she said.

"The boss of British Airways' parent company says that human error caused an IT meltdown that led to travel chaos for 75,000 passengers. Willie Walsh, chief executive of IAG, said an engineer disconnected a power supply, with the major damage caused by a surge when it was reconnected. He said there would now be an independent investigation ""to learn from the experience"". However, some experts say that blaming a power surge is too simplistic. Mr Walsh, appearing at an annual airline industry conference in Mexico on Monday, said: ""It's very clear to me that you can make a mistake in disconnecting the power. ""It's difficult for me to understand how to make a mistake in reconnecting the power,"" he said. He told reporters that the engineer was authorised to be in the data centre, but was not authorised ""to do what he did"". IAG has commissioned an ""independent company to conduct a full investigation"" into the IT crash and is ""happy to disclose details"" of its findings, Mr Walsh said. The name of the company involved had not been disclosed. The BBC reported last week that senior company executives at IAG werepushing for an external probe into the computer meltdown. BA had said that a power surge caused the computer problem, but gave little further explanation. However, an email leaked to the media last week suggested that a contractor doing maintenance work inadvertently switched off the power supply. The email said: ""This resulted in the total immediate loss of power to the facility, bypassing the backup generators and batteries... After a few minutes of this shutdown, it was turned back on in an unplanned and uncontrolled fashion, which created physical damage to the systems and significantly exacerbated the problem."" But the BBC's transport correspondent, Richard Westcott,has spoken to IT expertswho are sceptical that a power surge could wreak such havoc on the data centres. BA has two data centres about a kilometre apart. There are question marks over whether a power surge could hit both. Also, there should be fail-safes in place, our correspondent said. BA has already launched its own internal investigation, led by its chief executive Alex Cruz. Following the computer crash, which caused travel chaos for people travelling from Heathrow and Gatwick, Mr Walsh gave his full backing to Mr Cruz. BA and IAG also rejected claims that the incident was due to Mr Cruz's decision to outsource the airline's IT department to India as part of cost-cutting measures. Also on Monday, Mr Walsh apologised again for the incident, saying: ""When you see customers who suffered, you wouldn't want it to happen to any airline or any business."" He added: ""I wouldn't suggest for one minute we got communications right at BA, we didn't."" Cruz control: BA's unanswered questions Why did 'power surge' hit BA computers?

"Tributes have been left near the scene of the attack Police investigating Saturday night's terror attack in London say they know the identity of the three attackers who killed seven people and injured 48. The Met Police said their names would be released ""as soon as operationally possible"" as officers work to establish if they were part of a wider network. PM Theresa May said victims included a ""number of nationalities"", saying it was ""an attack on the free world"". It comes as police have searched more addresses in east London. Police said a ""number of people"" had been detained following the raids, in Newham and Barking. Eleven people are being held after police raids in Barking on Sunday. One of the properties is believed to be the home of one of the attackers. Latest updates as police raid properties In pictures: Tributes to victims Quiet but defiant mood at London Bridge How are UK extremists radicalised? The three attackers were shot dead by police after driving into pedestrians on London Bridge and stabbing people in Borough Market. The Independent Police Complaints Commission said 46 shots were fired by eight police officers - three from the City of London force and five from the Met. NHS England said 36 people remained in hospital, with 18 in a critical condition. Canadian national Chrissy Archibald, 30, was the first victim to be named. Her family said she had worked in a homeless shelter until she moved to Europe to be with her fiancÃ©. The sister of 32-year-old James McMullan, from Hackney, east London, said he was also believed to be among those who died after his bank card was found on a body at the scene. A French national was also killed in the attack, according to foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian. Chrissy Archibald moved to Europe to be with her fiancÃ© Security sources in Dublin have said one of the attackers was carrying an identification card issued in the Republic of Ireland when he was shot dead, the Press Association has reported. Meanwhile, Met Police Commissioner Cressida Dick said a ""huge amount"" of forensic material and evidence had been seized from the van - as well as from the police raids. She told BBC Breakfast the investigation was moving very quickly and the priority now was to establish if anybody else was involved in the plot. This video can not be played Florin tried to fight off an attacker at Borough Market The so-called Islamic State group has claimed responsibility for the attack.

""And that day I realised that I need to contact the authorities,"" he said. He said no action was taken. ""I did my bit... but the authorities didn't do their bit"".

Victims of the London Bridge attack Rugby-tackling officer among London's heroes Panic and bravery: What people saw By BBC's Katie Wright While the usual hordes of commuters stream across London Bridge, the large police presence and multitude of global TV crews show it's not a typical Monday morning. James Hartley, an HR manager in the city, crosses London Bridge every morning and would ""normally be marching across"". Today, he took a moment to stop and reflect. ""I'm just taking in the city and thinking about what happened over the weekend. It feels really emotional."" The overriding message to Londoners has been to carry on as normal, but for some of those who work near where the attack happened, that wasn't possible logistically. Abigail Barclay and her colleagues were gathered on the street near Borough Market unable to get into their office. She said: ""We're just working out our plan at the moment. There are lots of people out here trying to figure out what they're going to do."" Speaking on Sunday, Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said four police officers were among those injured, two of them seriously. The Met said one officer received stitches to a head injury and another received injuries to his arm. An off-duty officer, who was one of the first on the scene, remains in a serious condition. Police carried out raids in east London after Saturday's terror attack in the capital Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbullhas confirmed four of the country's nationalshad been caught up in the attack. Two, Candice Hedge from Brisbane and Andrew Morrison from Darwin, are among the injured after both were stabbed.

Eyewitnesses described it travelling at high speed, hitting pedestrians, before crashing close to the Barrowboy and Banker pub. It is the third terror attack in the UK in three months, following the car and knife attack on Westminster Bridge in March, in which five people were killed, and the Manchester bombing less than two weeks ago, in which 22 people were killed. Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondent With three attacks in three months, acts of terror against soft targets is beginning to feel, to some people, like the new normal. The brutal reality is that this kind of threat is absolutely typical of what jihadists sought to achieve in all their attacks across Europe. Since 2013 security services in the UK have foiled 18 plots. A large proportion of those have involved suspects who set out to commit acts of violence similar to the attacks on Westminster Bridge and London Bridge. Plans to use bombs, such as at Manchester Arena, are rarer because plotters need to have the technical skills for such an appalling attack - but attacking people with cars and knives is far easier and has long been encouraged by so-called Islamic State and other jihadists. The aim of the three attackers last night is abundantly clear - not only did they want to kill, but they wanted to lose their own lives. They would have known full well that attacking people in the street would draw armed police in their direction and the fake bomb belts they were wearing would, in their own warped minds, hasten their demise.

"John Robert Neumann had a history of misdemeanour criminal offences A disgruntled US employee walked back into the factory that fired him and fatally shot five ex-colleagues, before killing himself, police say. John Robert Neumann, 45, was armed with a semi-automatic handgun and hunting knife when he entered the business near Orlando, Florida, on Monday morning. The US army veteran was sacked in April, police say. There is no suggestion he was a member of a subversive or terrorist organisation, they add. This video can not be played Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings says seven survivors are being interviewed Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said the shooting had unfolded at the premises of Fiamma, which makes awnings for motor homes and camper vans. Most of the victims were shot in the head, some multiple times, he added. ""He was certainly singling out the individuals that he shot,"" said Sheriff Demings. The victims included Robert Snyder, 69, Brenda Montanez-Crespo, 44, Kevin Clark, 53, Jeffrey Roberts, 57, and another unidentified man. Police moved into the scene of the crime within minutes Neumann reloaded his handgun at least once during the rampage, the sheriff said. The gunman had told an employee whom he did not know to leave the premises, and left about seven other staff members uninjured. Neumann - who lived alone in the area - killed himself as deputies were about to enter the warehouse, the sheriff said. Authorities say he did not have a permit for the weapon. He was honourably discharged from the army in 1999. He had a history of misdemeanour criminal offences, such as possession of marijuana and driving under the influence. Neumann attacked a member of staff in 2014, though no charges were filed, police said. Ina statement,external, Florida Governor Rick Scott condemned a ""senseless act of violence"".

"A number of people put their safety at risk and helped others during Saturday's attack on London Bridge and Borough Market, which left eight people dead and 48 injured. Among them was a baker who wielded a bread crate at the attackers, as well as a man who used his skateboard to protect people, with supermarket workers offering free food and drink to emergency workers. Sunday Express business editor Geoff Ho was injured trying to help a bouncer Sunday Express business editor Geoff Ho dragged his wounded friend to safety while at the Black & Blue restaurant in Southwark - despite himself being stabbed in the neck. Earlier that night, he had helped a bouncer at the Southwark Tavern being attacked by two unarmed men, but said in astatement on Tuesday that the incident happened before he confronted the terrorists,external. ""At that point I thought 'job done, now for beer and food',"" he said. ""Within two minutes of my leaving the Southwark Tavern and posting 'not on my watch' on Facebook, the terrorist attackers arrived at the restaurant. ""Most of my friends and the staff hid under tables but one of my friends was frozen behind me."" The journalist said he ""tried to slow"" the attackers, who appeared to be wearing suicide vests. Victims of the attack What we know so far Who were the attackers? ""I think I got a hit in on one of them, but either he or his accomplice got me with a shot to the throat. ""They got my friend who was behind me with a minor stab wound in the face and hands and ran off. ""I picked up my friend and bundled him into the store room. I called the police and within moments they arrived. I gave the police descriptions of the three and we were evacuated."" Footage of him being escorted to an ambulance,externalby police has been posted on the Daily Express website. In it he is clutching his neck and using his shirt as a bandage. Mr Ho said he would make a full recovery and thanked staff at the Royal London Hospital. Ignacio had been cycling back from a park with two friends he had been skateboarding with when the attack began A Spanish man who used his skateboard to try to defend a woman who was being stabbed by one of the attackers has now been named as being one of the eight people killed. Ignacio EcheverrÃ­a, 39, saw the attack unfolding at London Bridge andrushed to help the woman. According to his father, friends saw the HSBC employee from Madrid, ""lying on the floor on the sidewalk after defending someone with his skateboard"". Spain's prime ministertweeted,externalthat he had requested that Mr Echeverria be granted Spain's Silver Cross of the Order of Civil Merit. PC Charlie Guenigault, pictured on the night of the London attack Off-duty police officer Charlie Guenigault - an amateur rugby player - was stabbed after tackling one of the three men. He was injured after rushing to the aid of a British Transport Police officer who had faced the attackers with only a baton. The family of the 25-year-old, who serves as an emergency response officer for the Southwark borough, said he ""showed immense bravery"". In a statement, they added: ""Given the opportunity again, Charlie would no doubt do exactly the same if faced with the same situation; helping a fellow police officer in need and protecting the public. ""He is immensely proud to work for the Metropolitan Police Service and serving the Southwark community, and this is an example of that. ""Charlie is described by his peers as a dedicated police officer, who is a diligent, hardworking and respected member of his team"". Met Police commissioner Cressida Dick praised the ""utterly heroic"" actions of the officer, who is in a stable condition in hospital. She said: ""It's hard to pick out individual stories but I am immensely proud of him and what he did."" The BTP officer, who has not been named, was seriously injured but is now in a stable condition. Chief Constable Paul Crowther from the BTP said the bravery he showed was ""outstanding"". The officer, who was stabbed in the attack, has said he has been ""truly moved and overwhelmed by all the support"". He added: ""I'm so sorry I couldn't do more and I want you to know I did everything I could."" This video can not be played Florin tried to fight off an attacker at Borough Market Romanian baker Florin Morariu saw a commotion outside Borough Market's Bread Ahead bakery, where he works, and invited some distressed Brazilian women inside and gave them a glass of water. When they told him that three men were stabbing people in the market, he headed outside with two crates to tackle the attackers. Speaking to the Victoria Derbyshire show, he said: ""I felt pity for the victims, I didn't know how to handle things or react, I thought to myself I'm also in danger. ""I just threw the crate at [one of the attackers]. ""I threw the first crate and I knew he was going to dodge it. While he was dodging it, I walked towards him and hit him in the head with the other crate."" He said a policeman then shouted at him to stand back, before discharging a stun grenade. Roy Larner was stabbed five times while attempting to shield people from the attackers. Friends have raised more than Â£10,000 for Mr Larner, who say he is now in intensive care, to go towards his recovery. Jayne Jacob, who set up a JustGiving page on Sunday, said: ""Roy got caught up in the terror attack at London Bridge and was badly injured whilst protecting lives. ""A Millwall supporter and in my mind a proper hero and deserves our support and aid to help him on his recovery."" According to friend Mick Church, Roy was left with stab wounds on his face, neck and suffered a collapsed lung. Carlos (left) and Giovanni were in a restaurant where an attacker stabbed a woman Giovanni Sagristani, 38, and his friends were in the El Pastor restaurant on Stoney Street when one of the attackers came in and stabbed a woman in the chest. ""He came in shouting and just stabbed her,"" he said. Mr Sagristani's partner Carlos Pinto, 33, who works as a critical care nurse in London, looked after the woman, with the help of his friend, another nurse. ""They took some ice and cloths and tried to stop the bleeding. She lost half a litre of blood in the beginning. He was keeping pressure on the wound,"" Mr Sagristani said. He said fellow diners had managed to push the attacker out of the restaurant by throwing chairs and bottles at him. Once the attacker was outside, staff lowered a security gate and locked people inside. Diners threw chairs and bottles at the attacker ""After the initial moment of panic, everyone tried to help this girl and stay calm. We were all at the back of the restaurant. There were shots going off outside and we didn't know what was going on."" Mr Sagristani said it was more than two hours before the paramedics were able to reach them. ""They kept her conscious. It was very lucky they were there,"" he added.

""It was clear that something was happening both from the way they were driving and the number of vehicles."" He said: ""Given what's been happening, I turned back to work."" When he arrived at the Royal London a major incident had been declared, and on-call staff were ready to treat all of the patients within 30 minutes. ""The 12 were all very badly injured. The people who had been stabbed, had been stabbed with an intent to kill."" Patients were ""startled to the point that they couldn't speak"".

"John Robert Neumann had a history of misdemeanour criminal offences A disgruntled US employee walked back into the factory that fired him and fatally shot five ex-colleagues, before killing himself, police say. John Robert Neumann, 45, was armed with a semi-automatic handgun and hunting knife when he entered the business near Orlando, Florida, on Monday morning. The US army veteran was sacked in April, police say. There is no suggestion he was a member of a subversive or terrorist organisation, they add. This video can not be played Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings says seven survivors are being interviewed Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said the shooting had unfolded at the premises of Fiamma, which makes awnings for motor homes and camper vans. Most of the victims were shot in the head, some multiple times, he added. ""He was certainly singling out the individuals that he shot,"" said Sheriff Demings. The victims included Robert Snyder, 69, Brenda Montanez-Crespo, 44, Kevin Clark, 53, Jeffrey Roberts, 57, and another unidentified man. Police moved into the scene of the crime within minutes Neumann reloaded his handgun at least once during the rampage, the sheriff said. The gunman had told an employee whom he did not know to leave the premises, and left about seven other staff members uninjured. Neumann - who lived alone in the area - killed himself as deputies were about to enter the warehouse, the sheriff said. Authorities say he did not have a permit for the weapon. He was honourably discharged from the army in 1999. He had a history of misdemeanour criminal offences, such as possession of marijuana and driving under the influence. Neumann attacked a member of staff in 2014, though no charges were filed, police said. Ina statement,external, Florida Governor Rick Scott condemned a ""senseless act of violence"".

"Reggie Young, who was three-weeks-old, died in hospital in 2015 A father who admitted owning a dog that killed his three-week-old son is facing jail. Reggie Young was attacked at his home in Falkland Road, Sunderland, on 20 June 2015 and died in hospital. Ryan Young, 32, had initially denied owning the terrier-type dog but changed his plea at Newcastle Crown Court. A child neglect charge will lie on file. Recorder Nicholas Lumley QC has adjourned sentencing to a future date to allow reports to be prepared. Click here for more on this story and other North East news He told Young that a prison sentence would be ""inevitable"" though. The dog was destroyed soon after the attack. Young's barrister Caroline Goodwin QC said Reggie's death had been an ""emotionally devastating chapter"" in the family's lives. Ryan Young's lawyer said it had been ""emotionally devastating"" for the family She said Young, who carried his son's coffin at the funeral, had had a very difficult time since the death and missed a previous court appearance because he ""simply could not face"" it. Reggie's mother, Maria Blacklin, was not in court for the sentencing earlier. She had been at an event marking a death in the family when the dog attacked her son, the court heard. During Reggie's funeral, Canon Provost Sheila Bamber said: ""He was simply amazing in his perfection, absolutely gorgeous, a golden little boy who brought a ray of sunshine into your family.

"This video can not be played Mak Chishty, the highest-ranking Met officer of Muslim faith, read a statement outside New Scotland Yard The Muslim community must ""root out the scourge of terrorism which... masquerades as Islam"" a Met Police commander has said. Mak Chishty describedSaturday's terror attackin London, which was claimed by the so-called Islamic State group, as ""an attack on all communities"". Seven died in the attack, with 48 hurt. The attackers were shot dead by police. ""Terrorism and extremism is hurting Islam,"" said Mr Chishty - the highest-ranking Met officer of Muslim faith. ""Every time a terrorist attack takes place, Muslim communities either face, or fear, a backlash against them,"" said a statement read by Mr Chishty on behalf of Muslim community groups. ""The Muslim community appeals to all sections within their own communities to root out the scourge of terrorism which hides amongst their own people and masquerades as Islam. ""The Muslim community is alarmed and concerned that this attack by three people, which would have required planning, was not reported."" The three attackers drove a van into pedestrians on London Bridge and launched a knife attack in Borough Market before being shot by police. It was the third terror attack in the UK in three months, following the car and knife attack in Westminster in March, in which five people were killed, and the Manchester bombing on 22 May, when 22 people were killed. Speaking outside New Scotland Yard, flanked by Muslim community leaders, Mr Chishty added: ""It is the Islamic duty of every Muslim to be loyal to the country in which they live and we are now asking questions to understand how extremism and hatred has taken hold within some elements of our own communities. ""Muslims must do more to stop such attacks from happening again and we want to know how we can play a greater role in the future.""

"We've had manifestos, gaffes and a tightening in the polls. But what else have we learned since Theresa May called a snap election? The party manifesto is a key document that has the potential to make or break an election campaign, as Theresa May experienced following the launch of the Conservative's. Her party's plan to make elderly people requiring care at home liable for the costs -  apart from Â£100,000, which they could keep - proved controversial. The policy, which would delay people's payment from their estates until after they died, meant some people - and many typical Tory voters - would not be able to pass their home on to their children. It took Mrs May just four days  - and lots of negative reaction - to add that there would be a cap to the amount of money one person would pay for care. There had been no mention of a limit in the manifesto and ministers had publically rejected the idea. But the prime minister denied claims of a U-turn. The moral is ""don't make up significant manifesto policies on the hoof"", John Curtice, professor of politics at Strathclyde University, says. Theresa May denies social care U-turn Whiff of panic in May's social care response This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn struggles over childcare cost on Woman's Hour For any politician who has a live broadcast interview, preparation - and knowledge of your party's policies - is essential. Two gaffes stand out. Shadow home secretary Diane Abbottmixed-up her numbers in an interview with LBC's Nick Ferrari, while party leader Jeremy Corbynstumbled over the cost of Labour's plan for free childcareon BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour, managing only ""a lot"". ""It was almost a Diane Abbott moment,"" says BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith. ""He was clearly struggling badly for the numbers."" It was names that proved tricky during the ITV leaders' debate for UKIP leader Paul Nuttall. He called Plaid Cymru's Leanne Wood ""Natalie"" twice, despite there being no Natalie on the panel. ""The classic moments [of election campaigns] are the ones when things go wrong, because they are so controlled,"" says Steven Fielding, professor of political history at the University of Nottingham. ITV Leaders' debate: Paul, Leanne and... Natalie? Are coalition governments a thing of the past? Historically the Conservatives and Labour have commanded the majority share of the vote in general elections, with smaller parties not getting much of a look-in. Then, in 2010, we had a coalition government with the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, as neither of the two larger parties could command a majority. And in 2015, nearly four million people voted for UKIP. This secured only one MP but the party achieved 12.6% of the popular vote, putting it third behind the Conservatives and Labour. For a while, it looked like the era of two-party politics might be on the decline. But then UKIP lost 145 councillors in May's local elections in England and Wales. UKIP voters are turning to the Tories now that Brexit is on, BBC political correspondent Ben Wright says. The Lib Dems don't seem to have made much of a recovery from their 2015 losses, leaving the Tories and Labour the only real contenders. But Prof Curtice says it's important not to forget about the SNP. ""Two-party politics is only back in England and Wales - not in Scotland, and as a result there will still be a lot of third party MPs in the next parliament,"" he says. Local elections: UKIP suffers big losses across England The ""Theresa May"" battle bus Battle buses are the key staple of any good election campaign, but this year they appear to tell a tale. The Conservative Party battle bus is all about ""Theresa May"", while many of the party's campaign signs read ""Theresa May's Team"". As theTelegraph's parliamentary sketchwriter, Michael Deacon,externalnotes, the Tory campaign has a ""downright presidential focus on leader rather than party"". In contrast, Labour's battle bus focuses on the party - rather than their leader Jeremy Corbyn - and some election leaflets are the same. ""Jeremy does not go down well with our core Labour support,"" says Newcastle-under-Lyme Labour candidate Paul Farrelly, who does not put Mr Corbyn on his leaflets. In comparison, there is no mention of Jeremy Corbyn on Labour's battle bus Prof Fielding says it is not unusual for parties to use their leaders in this ""all encompassing way"". ""In the 1945 election, the Conservatives knew they were not popular - but they also knew that Winston Churchill was incredibly popular, so they actually called their manifesto Mr Churchill's Declaration of Policy,"" he says. However it did not work. Mr Churchill lost. General election 2017: Breaking the party line? About 30% of candidates are women - up from the previous record of 26% in 2015, although the actual number of women standing is down from 1,036 to 983. There are, however, fewer candidates overall standing - about 3,300 compared to 3,971 in 2015. But about 7.5 million people will not be able to vote for a woman as more than 100 constituencies across the UK have no female candidate on the ballot. according to BBC research. There is one seat where it is impossible to elect a man to Parliament: Glasgow Central has four names on the ballot - all are women. Why 7.5m people can't vote for a woman How many women might win power? When Mrs May called this snap election, the Conservative Party was ahead in the polls by some way. But Labour has been closing the gap. However, senior elections and political analyst Peter Barnes warns there are still quite large differences between the pollsters' figures. And, as we learned in 2015, the polls can be wrong. Almost all of the pollsters have changed their methods since then, but we won't know how successfully until 8 June. How pre-election polls got it wrong How reliable are the polls? Election 2017 poll tracker: How the parties compare Young people prefer Labour over the Conservatives, according to opinion polls, but the majority don't vote. If 18-24-year-olds turned out to vote as much as over 65 year olds, that could result in five to 10 seats transferring from Conservative to Labour, according to BBC analysis. That might not sound like a lot, but in a tight election such as 2015, it could make a big difference. As the Tories ended up with a majority of only 12 seats, any changes could have led to minority government or another coalition. If more young people actually voted, would it change everything? The EU referendum saw a huge increase in the number of people turning out to vote. Broadly speaking, 2.9 million more people voted in the referendum, compared with the May 2015 general election, David Cowling, a political opinion polling specialist from King's College London, says. The turnout for the referendum was the largest turnout in England since the 1992 general election and largest in Wales since the 1997 general election. The big question is, will they return this time? The mystery of the three million 'extra' voters This video can not be played UK hip-hop artist Guvna B: 'Not enough representation' of ethnic minorities About 50% of London constituencies have no Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) candidates in the five main parties. Also five of the consistencies with no BAME candidates have a population of more than 50% BAME. UK hip-hop artist Guvna B told the BBC: ""It's really strange for me that there is not enough representation at that level."" Half of Britain's adults see Brexit as the most important issue in the UK,a poll by Ipsos Mori,externalsuggested before the snap election was called. The Liberal Democrats have centred their campaign on the issue of Brexit, offering a second referendum on a deal, as have the Green Party. But Prof Stephen Fisher, from Oxford University, says: ""Most people who voted Remain are not desperate for a second referendum."" According to aYouGov survey,externalpublished earlier this month, 23% of people questioned were classed as ""Re-Leavers"" - those who voted to Remain in the EU but think that the government has a duty to leave, and 45% were ""Hard Leavers"" who want out. That left only 22% of people who were ""Hard Remainers"" - those who want to stop Brexit - and 9% who didn't know. So it might not be the Brexit election after all.

"Qatar's government said it believed the move was ""unjustified"" A number of Arab countries including Saudi Arabia and Egypt have cut diplomatic ties with Qatar, accusing it of destabilising the region. They say Qatar backs militant groups including so-called Islamic State (IS) and al-Qaeda, which Qatar denies. The Saudi state news agency SPA said Riyadh had closed its borders, severing land, sea and air contact with the tiny peninsula of oil-rich Qatar. Qatar called the decision ""unjustified"" and with ""no basis in fact"". The unprecedented move is seen as a major split between powerful Gulf countries, who are also close US allies. It comes amid heightened tensions between Gulf countries and their near-neighbour, Iran. TheSaudi statement,externalaccused Qatar of collaborating with ""Iranian-backed terrorist groups"" in its restive eastern region of Qatif and in Bahrain. The diplomatic withdrawal was first put into motion by Bahrain, then Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Egypt, Yemen, Libya's eastern-based government and the Maldives all followed suit. SPA cited officials as saying the decision was taken to ""protect its national security from the dangers of terrorism and extremism"". The diplomatic crisis is likely to disrupt Qatar's food imports from Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Bahrain have given all Qatari visitors and residents two weeks to leave their territory. The three countries have also banned their citizens from travelling to Qatar. However, Saudi Arabia says it will still allow Qataris to take part in the annual Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca. So far, there has been no sign of reciprocal moves by Qatar. In the latest developments: The UAE and Egypt have given Qatari diplomats 48 hours to leave both countries Airlines from many of the affected countries, including EgyptAir, Etihad Airways and Emirates, said they are to cancel flights to and from the Qatari capital Doha The Gulf allies said they had closed their airspace to Qatar Airways, which has suspended all its flights to Saudi Arabia Bahrain's state news agency said it was cutting its ties because Qatar was ""shaking the security and stability of Bahrain and meddling in its affairs"" The Saudi-led Arab coalition fighting Yemen's Houthi rebels also expelled Qatar from its alliance because of its ""practices that strengthen terrorism"" and its support of extremist groups. Why this row has erupted Food, flights and football at risk US President Trump met Egyptian President Sisi and Saudi King Salman in Saudi Arabia two weeks ago While the severing of ties was sudden, it has not come out of the blue, as tensions have been building for years, and particularly in recent weeks. Two weeks ago, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the UAEblocked Qatari news sites, including Al Jazeera. Comments purportedly by Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani criticising Saudi Arabia had appeared on Qatari state media. The government in Doha dismissed the comments as fake, attributing the report to a ""shameful cybercrime"". Back in 2014, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the UAE withdrew their ambassadors from Qatar for several months in protest over alleged interference in their affairs. 'A Qatarstrophe' - social media reacts All you need to know about Qatar The story behind Qatar 'hack' More broadly, two key factors drove Monday's decision: Qatar's ties to Islamist groups, and the role of Iran, Saudi Arabia's regional rival. While Qatar has joined the US coalition against IS, the Qatari government has repeatedly denied accusations from Iraq's Shia leaders that it provided financial support to IS. Wealthy individuals in the country are believed to have made donations and the government has given money and weapons to hardline Islamist groups in Syria. Qatar is also accused of having links to a group formerly known as the Nusra Front, an al-Qaeda affiliate. The SPA statement accused Qatar of backing these groups, as well as the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood - banned in Gulf countries as a terrorist organisation - and that it ""promotes the message and schemes of these groups through their media constantly"". Saudi Arabia itself is a key backer of Islamist rebels, including hardline jihadist groups, in Syria. Where key countries stand on IS Where does IS get its support? While on a visit to Riyadh two weeks ago, US President Donald Trump urged Muslim countries to take the lead in combating radicalisation,and blamed Iranfor instability in the Middle East. ""It seems that the Saudis and Emiratis feel emboldened by the alignment of their regional interests - toward Iran and Islamism - with the Trump administration,"" Gulf analyst Kristian Ulrichsen told Reuters news agency. ""[They] have decided to deal with Qatar's alternative approach on the assumption that they will have the [Trump] administration's backing."" Is Saudi to blame for IS? Saudi Arabia, too, has been accused of funding IS, either directly or by failing to prevent private donors from sending money to the group - allegations it denies. In recent days, British Prime Minister Theresa May has also come under pressure from election rivals to publish a report thought to focus on the funding of UK extremist groups by Saudi Arabia. Qatar, which is due to host the football World Cup in 2022, was critical of the decision. The foreign ministry said the decisions would ""not affect the normal lives of citizens and residents"". US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, speaking in Sydney, urged the countries to resolve their differences through dialogue. This video can not be played US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson urges Gulf states to ""address differences"" Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi said there was a need for ""transparent dialogue and diplomacy"", adding: ""No country in the region will benefit from the heightened tension."" Qatar's stock market closed down 7.27%. One of the likely knock-on effectsis on food stability: about 40% of Qatar's food is believed to come  by lorry from Saudi Arabia. The Doha News newspaperreported,externalthat people had rushed to supermarkets to stock up on food and water. Nearly 90% of Qatar's population are migrant workers, many of whom are working on the construction boom fuelled by the successful World Cup bid. There have long been tensions not far beneath the surface. Qatar has often seemed out of step with its neighbours. It has tended, for example, to side with Islamist forces in the Middle East - like the Muslim Brotherhood, which is reviled by the Saudis and the current Egyptian leadership. Past efforts by the neighbours to pull the Qataris into line have had limited impact. But now Doha has suddenly come under much greater and more co-ordinated pressure. Emboldened by President Trump's trip two weeks ago, the Saudis and the Emiratis believe that this is the moment to make clear to Qatar that its divergent views will no longer be tolerated. And right now this small country's rulers will probably be feeling very lonely indeed. What's behind crisis with Qatar?

"This video can not be played Stars spread a message of love at the Manchester concert There were high emotions at a benefit concert staged by Ariana Grande in Manchester less than two weeks after the terror attack following her gig in the city. But the show also demonstrated the power of pop music to bring people together. Several viewers took to social media to highlight the momenta policeman was seen dancing with young fansas a symbol of the city's unity. The concert was watched by an average of 10.9 million viewers, peaking at 14.5 million as the gig drew to a close - making it the most watched TV show of the year so far. Here are some of the night's other most powerful moments. ""Manchester, we're strong, we're strong, we're strong/We're still singing our song, our song, our song."" - Robbie Williams, Strong (2017 version) With a few tweaks to the chorus, Robbie has turned a minor 1999 hit into a rousing song to rally the masses in Manchester 2017. Everyone in the crowd could easily bellow the simple chorus, and Robbie bellowed it in between songs too. It even overshadowed his classic Angels as his main sing-a-long moment. ""No matter what you say it won't hurt me/Don't matter if I fall from the sky/These wings are made to fly."" - Little Mix, Wings Little Mix induced some of the most piercing screams of the night. The girl group explained that Wings is about encouraging people to ""stand together and not let anything bring them down"" - but their performance was the biggest slice of pure, escapist, plastic pop we had. So it was also the epitome of one aspect of what tonight was all about - defending the right to gyrate in PVC pants and conjure cliche-ridden fantasies, and for fans to lap up every second of it. ""If I go tomorrow, just know I'm yours/'Cause what we got is worth fighting for."" - Ariana Grande, My Everything Rubbing shoulders with the pop superstars were 26 students from Parrs Wood High School Choir in Manchester, who performed a tear-jerking rendition of Grande's My Everything. They were invited to perform after putting their version of the trackon YouTube,externalin tribute to those who died in the attack. Angel-voiced soloist Natasha Seth, 12, was joined by Grande herself, who held the girl's hand - then, as the emotion became too much for the youngster, put her arm around her shoulder and squeezed her tight. ""Throw your sticks and your stones, throw your bombs and your blows/But you're not gonna break my soul."" - Katy Perry, Part of Me Of all the performers, Katy Perry captured the mood of defiance and strength the best. Wearing a white feathered gown, she started by telling the crowd: ""Love conquers fear and love conquers hate and this love that you choose will give you strength, and it's our greatest power."" Part of Me hit exactly the right tone - reflective and empowering - before she unleashed her full-throated anthem of defiance, Roar. Policeman captures Manchester's spirit Watch clips from the concert on BBC Music Joy shines through pain at benefit gig As it happened: One Love Manchester concert ""Overseas, yeah, we try to stop terrorism/But we still got terrorists here livin'"" - Black Eyed Peas, Where Is The Love? Almost 15 years after it was a mega hit, this song still sums up the incomprehension most people feel at the brutal ruthlessness of the modern world, while offering hope that it doesn't have to be this way. Ariana joined on vocals and there was a real moment when the band encouraged fans to raise a finger to represent ""one love"" and make heart shapes with their hands. Will.i.am did arrive on stage saying ""Whassup London!"" - but he just about got away with it by paying tribute to the capital as well as Manchester. ""Don't look back in anger, I heard you say/At least not today"" - Oasis, Don't Look Back In Anger Another song that has taken on new significance for Mancunians in the past two weeks is Oasis's Don't Look Back In Anger. Here, it fell to Coldplay to perform it, with a little help from Ariana. Few bands can get a crowd going like Coldplay, and it was the first of four songs the band played. As the sun set, thousands of mobile phone lights twinkled during Fix You. Then millions of small multi-coloured stars drifted across the crowd after being shot out of a glitter cannon as Viva La Vida morphed into Something Just Like This. ""Maybe you're the same as me/We see things they'll never see/You and I are gonna live forever."" - Oasis, Live Forever Former Oasis frontman Liam Gallagher was a surprise addition to the line-up, pleasing many of the Mancunian music fans and representing a different side of the musical spectrum to most of the other acts. And a song that was once all about bravado became melancholy and tender here. That was thanks in part to Chris Martin, again, who filled in for Liam's brother Noel on acoustic guitar. We even just about forgave Liam for playing a new song, Wall of Glass. ""So one last time/I need to be the one who takes you home/One more time/I promise after that, I'll let you go."" - Ariana Grande, One Last Time Of all of Ariana's songs, this is the one that fans have turned to since the attack. It was the penultimate song here, which she sang with the rest of the line-up stood behind her. On the verge of tears, she then went into an incredibly poignant version of Over the Rainbow to close the show. Her performance throughout the night carried dignified emotion, and she showed grit and willpower by staging this show less than two weeks after those tragic events. After tonight, she is idolised a little bit more by her fans, is higher in the estimation of those who had thought of her as a pop kitten, and is admired by those who only heard her name for the first time 13 days ago.

"This video can not be played Donald Trump challenged London Mayor Sadiq Khan to an IQ test US President Donald Trump has again lashed out at London Mayor Sadiq Khan over his assurances to Londoners following Saturday's terror attack. He accused Mr Khan of offering a ""pathetic excuse"" for saying there was no reason for people to be alarmed. Mr Khan had in fact said people should not be alarmed by an increased police presence. After a vigil for the victims of the attack, Mr Khan said he would not allow Mr Trump to ""divide our communities"". Seven people were killed and 48 others injured in the attack on Saturday. Mr Trump took issue with Mr Khan's statement in the aftermath of the attack, when the mayor said: ""Londoners will see an increased police presence today and over the course of the next few days. No reason to be alarmed."" The US president responded: ""At least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is 'no reason to be alarmed!'"" He followed this up with another tweet on Monday, saying: ""Pathetic excuse by London Mayor Sadiq Khan who had to think fast on his ""no reason to be alarmed"" statement. MSM [mainstream media] is working hard to sell it!"" The mayor's spokesman earlier made clear that he was telling Londoners not to be worried about the increased presence of armed police officers in the city. Is Trump's thin skin to blame? A skateboard, a crate: How London fought back This video can not be played Sadiq Khan: 'This is our city, these are our values and this is our way of life'. Speaking to the BBC after the vigil, Mr Khan said: ""We've got to recognise that some people want to divide our communities, some people thrive on fuelling division. ""That's not me, that's not the London  I know, and we aren't going to allow anybody, whether it's Donald Trump or anybody else to divide our community."" His spokesperson earlier said he ""has more important things to do than respond to Donald Trump's ill-informed tweet that deliberately takes out of context"" the mayor's remarks. Mr Trump's attacks on Mr Khan have drawn condemnation from both sides of the Atlantic. His critics have accused him of being insensitive and twisting the mayor's words. Politicians in the UK on Monday called on the prime minister to withdraw the invitation for Mr Trump's state visit later this year. The leader of the Liberal Democrats, Tim Farron, said: ""This is a man insulting our national values at a time of introspection and mourning."" Over the weekend, Prime Minister Theresa May refused to criticise Mr Trump, simply saying that Mr Khan was doing a ""good job"". British voters go to the polls on Thursday in a general election. ""Try to imagine the UK prime minister attacking the Mayor of NYC the day after 9/11,"" said European Parliament cabinet member Simon O'Connor. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio was quick to defend Mr Khan, praising him for ""doing exactly the right thing"". ""I don't understand why Donald Trump is trying to undermine a man who's trying to protect the people of London. It makes no sense,"" Mr de Blasio told the BBC's Nick Bryant during a press conference in New York on Monday.Trump renews feud with mayor of London This video can not be played New York mayor on his London counterpart: ""He deserves support, not efforts to undermine him"" The US Conference of Mayors, representing more than 1,400 American cities, backed Mr Khan. ""He has risen above this crisis of death and destruction, as mayors continue to do, to alleviate fear, to bring comfort to his people of London,"" the mayorswrote in a statement on Sunday,external. Mr Khan, a Muslim, has previously criticised the president's plans to temporarily restrict travel to the US from six mainly Muslim countries. After Mr Trump as a presidential candidate announced his plan, Mr Khan told the BBC he hoped he would""lose badly"", adding that he was a ""buffoon"". He also called Mr Trump's views on Islam ""ignorant"", leading the New York billionaire tochallenge him to an IQ test. In the wake of the London attack, Mr Trump has been tweeting about his stalled travel ban. This video can not be played Sadiq Khan: ""[Donald Trump's] views are divisive, they're outrageous and I hope he loses - badly"" Federal courts struck down the first proposal in January. The administration replaced it with a less stringent version order in March, but that also ended up in limbo after legal defeats. On Monday, the president attacked the Justice Department for revising the original measure, leaving it ""watered down"" and ""politically correct"". The Trump administration is expected to take the proposal to the Supreme Court next week. He argues the measure is needed to prevent attacks in the US, but critics say the policy is discriminatory and has little national security justification. Trump challenges Khan to IQ test.

"Eight people were killed during the London Bridge terror attack on 3 June 2017. Three men drove into pedestrians on the bridge and then stabbed people in nearby Borough Market. Here are the victims' stories. Canadian Chrissy Archibald died in the arms of her fiance after being struck by the attackers' van on London Bridge. Tyler Ferguson had proposed to Ms Archibald, 30, four months earlier after she moved to be with him in the Netherlands. The couple were busy learning Dutch, making wedding plans and talking about starting a family. Ms Archibald was a social worker, who had worked in a shelter for people with drug and drink addictions. Her family had worried she was too gentle for such difficult and heart-wrenching work, but she proved them all wrong.  She had found her calling, said her father, Greg Archibald. On the weekend of the attacks, Ms Archibald decided to join Mr Ferguson, who was in London on a work trip. The couple went out for dinner on Saturday night to celebrate a successful day for Mr Ferguson, but as they crossed London Bridge, Ms Archibald was hit by the van.  She died from multiple injuries. Chrissy Archibald and Tyler Ferguson were making wedding plans At the inquest, Mr Archibald said: ""The world has many sunshine people in it. Their smiles warm us. They make life bright and cheerful. ""But Chrissy was not the sunshine. Chrissy was the moon. ""You might not notice the moon on a sunny day, but you need the moon when life is dark and it's hard to find your way. ""That was our Chrissy: quiet and silvery but lighting a path for you to follow and reaching out a hand to help."" We did our best - London Bridge attack PC Fiance tells of 'chaos' after London Bridge attack French-born Sebastien Belanger was watching the Champions League final with friends at a pub in Borough Market before he was killed in the attack. The 36-year-old, who had been in the UK for seven years, was working as a chef at the French restaurant Coq d'Argent, in central London. Several years earlier, he had been promoted to head chef. ""I am so very proud of him,"" his mother, Josiane Belanger, told the inquest. ""He worked very hard but also liked partying with his friends."" On the night of the attack, Mr Belanger, originally from Angers, western France, and his friends heard a van crash into railings nearby and went to investigate. But under a dark archway, he was cornered and stabbed by the three attackers. Two police officers tried to save him but he died from stab wounds to the chest. ""I do not forgive what they did to him,"" said his mother. ""They mutilated and killed him."" In a tribute, his brother, Julien Belanger, said his family would never forget Sebastien. ""To see you again we simply need to close our eyes, to remember your kindness, your smile, your mischievous look, your generosity, your love for your family."" Medics 'not told' where attack victims were Kirsty Boden, an off-duty nurse, was having a meal out with two friends at Boro Bistro when she heard the sound of a crashing vehicle and ran to offer help. The Australian-born 28-year-old was stabbed as she knelt over restaurant waiter Alexandre Pigeard as he lay dying. She ran through an alleyway but died there from a chest wound. Her bravery earned her the name the ""angel of London Bridge"" and posthumous medals for bravery from the Queen and the Australian government. Her partner, James Hodder, said her actions that night did not surprise anyone who knew her. ""She loved people and lived her life helping others. To Kirsty, her actions that night would have just been an extension of how she lived her life,"" he said. Ms Boden, originally from Loxton in south Australia, had been working at Guy's Hospital and living in Hampstead in north London with Mr Hodder, whom she had first met in a flat-share. ""She completely floored me with her smile and kindness, and I very quickly fell in love with her,"" Mr Hodder told the inquest. He said the two had enjoyed ""geeky"" first dates at the transport museum and a canal museum, before travelling together across much of Europe. ""Anyone who met Kirsty knew that she was different. Whether it was through her smile, the kind words she would always have, or the fact that she would always move heaven and earth to be there for you,"" said Mr Hodder. ""Kirsty just had the ability to leave a lasting impact on your life, and that's why there are so many people here and in Australia who miss her so much."" London Bridge nurse killed treating waiter Ignacio Echeverria ran towards the attackers and tried to beat them with his skateboard when he saw one of them stabbing a woman. But they quickly turned their knives on him. The 39-year-old Spaniard had been cycling with friends along Borough High Street after a day's skateboarding on the South Bank. CCTV shows him get off his bike, run towards two police officers who were trying to stop the attackers and swing his skateboard at Rachid Redouane, who then knocked him to the ground. He died from stab wounds to the back - and was the last person killed in the attack. Mr Echeverria, a financial crime analyst at HSBC, had been living in London for a year-and-a-half, enjoying spending time with his sister and her young family and making skateboarding friends. On the night he died, he postponed a visit to his sister's home as he was having such a good time skateboarding. Mr Echeverria had been a hard-working, disciplined student who completed his law masters in French and Spanish, and also spoke English and German fluently. As a Roman Catholic, he attended Mass every week and always defended his beliefs, his family told the inquest in a statement. Through skateboarding, he befriended youngsters from different backgrounds, and saw an opportunity to influence and encourage them in their studies and work. The Queen presented Mr Echeverria's parents with a bravery award for their son His bravery on the night posthumously earned him the George Medal, which the Queen presented to his parents last year. The award committee said his actions had ""undoubtedly prevented further loss of life"" by giving others time to run away. His father, Joaquin Echeverria Alonso, told the BBC his son said he would have intervened had he passed the Westminster Bridge attack that happened three months earlier. ""Later, during the attack at London Bridge, he demonstrated this through his actions,"" his father said. Skateboard hero receives bravery award Doctor 'ran from bar to save attack victims' James McMullan had nipped out of the Barrowboy and Banker pub for a cigarette after the football match had finished, when the attackers' van smashed into nearby railings. Instead of running, he went to help up Australian au pair Sara Zelenak who appeared to have fallen over on the wet pavement in her high heels, the inquest heard. Witnesses said Mr McMullan tried to pick her up but there was no time for either of them to get away. The 32-year-old British-Filipino became one of the attackers' first victims. He died from a haemorrhage and stab wound to the chest. That night, Mr McMullan had been out with friends celebrating getting financial backing for his own online education company. The day before, he had called his mother, Mila, to excitedly tell her the last two years of sleepless nights were finally going to pay off. He told her everything was going to be OK and he was going to be able to look after her, his sister, Melissa McMullan, told the inquest. He was going to be able to help children who didn't have access to education, through his e-learning platform and make her proud, she said. This video can not be played Melissa McMullan says her brother James was an inspiration At the inquest, his father, Simon McMullan, told how James could talk the socks off anyone. ""James had more friends than most, and all of them will tell you that he was the life and soul of any gathering, that his lust for life was infectious."" He would also help others, no questions asked, said Mr McMullan. ""He would be there to see you through a personal crisis . He would give you the confidence to get that promotion. He would make sure you had a good night out. He would drive in the middle of the night to pick you up from 100 miles away."" London Bridge victim 'slipped' before attack Alexandre Pigeard, a waiter at Boro Bistro, went outside to investigate when he heard the attackers' van crash - but came face to face with the attackers. They stabbed him once, and then all three set upon him again after he collapsed. He died from a haemorrhage and neck and chest stab wounds. The 26-year-old French national, who was living in south-east London, had been in the UK for less than a year. He had settled into his new life, becoming a cheerful, efficient colleague in the restaurant who took full advantage of London's nightlife. A music lover, he was nicknamed ""King of the Night"" by his friends. ""He was a big brother, a confidant, an accomplice whose joy of living was contagious,"" his family said in a tribute set to music that was played at the inquest. He had plans to leave London in the autumn to open a restaurant in Nantes, western France, and produce his first techno EP with his father, the inquest heard. In the hours before the attack, Mr Pigeard, the eldest of six, spoke to his father on his break, chatting about music and upcoming festivals. ""He tells me to kiss the kids. I kiss him and wish him 'bon courage, mon grand',"" said Philippe Pigeard. He told the inquest: ""It's now 703 days since the events took place. ""703 days where I'm a ghost wandering in the night that took away Alexandre, a handful of minutes of horror, of barbarism, cruelty where the assassins jumped on him."" Nurse confronted London Bridge attacker Xavier Thomas was engaged to Christine Delcros when he was killed in the attack Hand-in-hand, Xavier Thomas and his fiancee, Christine Delcros, were walking over London Bridge on their way to cocktails in the Shard, a skyscraper next to the bridge, when the attackers' van mounted the pavement and struck them both. Mr Thomas was thrown over the bridge into the River Thames, and Ms Delcros was seriously injured. For three days, a search team, including a helicopter, scoured the river for him. His body was eventually found almost two miles away, near Shadwell Basin. He had died from immersion. Mr Thomas, 45, had lived in a town near Paris and was a business travel manager for American Express, where he had worked for 25 years. He was a devoted father to his children, Noemie, 24, and Nicolas, 17, whom he had largely raised on his own. At the inquest, Mr Thomas' parents, Philippe and Christiane Pesez, said his number one priority was to secure the best possible future for them. ""They were the apple of his eye. He looked after their education, their sports and other activities and ran the household, always in good spirits, without complaining about the problems he might have to face , and always managing to keep smiling."" Without him, the family felt lost, they said. Both Noemie and Nicolas now have a tattoo to remember their father. Ms Delcros, who had been with Mr Thomas for two years, told the inquest she was still ""madly in love"" with Mr Thomas and nothing could destroy that connection. London Bridge fiancee had 'premonition' Sara Zelenak, the youngest of the victims, was given Saturday night off work at the last minute and found herself in Borough Market just as the attackers' van crashed into railings. The 21-year old Australian au pair slipped in her heels on a wet pavement as she tried to get away, witnesses say. James McMullan attempted to help her to her feet but the attackers were too quick. Ms Zelenak was stabbed in the neck. Ms Zelenak grew up in Queensland, loving sport, rarely missing an afternoon nap and getting excited about the little things in life like spaghetti Bolognese. After finishing school, she worked in a pub and tried floristry but realised she could make more money if she joined her father operating a crane truck. Her mother, Julie Wallace, said she had soon saved up more than all her friends put together and decided to go on a ""trip of a lifetime"". She made a plan to tour Europe and meet her parents in Paris. The first three months were spent in the UK, where she started working as a live-in au pair in south-west London. Julie Wallace told the inquest her daughter, who called her daily, loved the family and children and had already bonded with fellow au pairs. ""Sarz was the happiest she had ever been: working, travelling, meeting new people, doing all the things 21-year-olds should do,"" said Mrs Wallace. But on the night of the attack, ""every sliding door slid for Sara to be in harm's way"", she said. She was unexpectedly given the night off; she and a friend had not found a rooftop bar they had been looking for and then they switched plans to go out in Borough Market instead of Soho. Last year, her parents launched a charity - Sarz Sanctuary - in her memory to help others overcome the loss of a loved one in traumatic circumstances.

"Cecilia Wessels said her husband Theunis was ""calm, in control"" A picture of a man in Canada calmly mowing his lawn with a menacing tornado swirling in the background has gone viral on social media. Theunis Wessels was ""fully aware"" of the twister but ""wasn't worried at all"", his wife Cecilia, who took the photo, told the BBC. She said the tornado was about 2km (1.25 miles) from their house in Three Hills, Alberta - much further away than it appeared in the photo. The storm was quickly gone, she added. Mrs Wessels told the BBC she was sleeping in the house on Friday - but then was woken by her nine-year-old daughter who was concerned that her father would not abandon his lawn-mowing and hide inside from the tornado. ""My daughter was the most upset, saying 'Mum, what we gonna do?'"" Mrs Wessels came outside to check on her husband, who continued mowing. He said ""Everything is OK,"" and he looked ""calm, in control,"" she recollected. She added that he had some knowledge about twisters as he had recently attended a seminar organised by a storm-chasing association. No-one was injured in Three Hills, and the twister caused only minor structural damage Many town residents were taking pictures of the tornado, and Mrs Wessels decided to post hers on Facebook and also sent them to her mother in South Africa. She said her mother was very worried about her son-in-law, asking: ""Why are you letting him outside? Please stay safe."" Very soon the picture began causing a storm on the social media. One user wrote: ""This is the craziest picture! Lol. I'm glad that the tornado didn't come down on your house!"", while another described Mrs Wessels' husband as ""the Chuck Norris of lawn mowers!"" Mrs Wessels said her photo had already been shared 3,500 times in two days, and she had received 256 friend requests. She said Friday's tornado was moving east - away from the house, and was gone in less than five minutes. It caused no injuries in the town, and only minor structural damage was reported. Local authorities only issued a tornado warning after she had posted her pictures, Mrs Wessels said. How does a tornado form? Video, 00:01:42How does a tornado form?

"The PM says internet giants have provided a ""safe space"" for extremist ideology Prime Minister Theresa May has said more must be done to tackle terror online. In a speech on Sunday, following the terrorist attack in London, she said the internet provided a ""safe space"" for extremist ideology to breed. But technology companies and cyber-security experts have warned that tighter regulation of the internet will not solve this problem. Messages sent online can be scrambled as they leave one device and they remain scrambled until they are deciphered by the recipient's device. This is end-to-endencryption,and it stops messages being read by third parties - be it criminals or law enforcement - if they are intercepted. This adds valuable security to the messages we send online, which could contain private information, bank details and personal photographs. Some apps such as WhatsApp already add end-to-end encryption to messages automatically. WhatsApp messages are end-to-end encrypted However, this does mean that theoretically messages can be sent that police or other authorities cannot read if they intercept them. On Sunday, Mrs May said there should be no messages that law enforcement ""cannot read"", while Home Secretary Amber Rudd said she wanted tech companies to ""limit the use of end-to-end encryption"". Critics say disabling encryption in popular apps will not deter criminals - they could simply switch from one app to another, or create their own messaging apps. Meanwhile, messages sent by law-abiding citizens would become ""easy for criminals, voyeurs and foreign spies to intercept"", journalist and former digital rights activist Cory Doctorowwrote in a blog.,external Cyber-security experts are particularly critical of the notion that messaging apps should have a ""back door"" in their systems, to let authorities read users' messages. ""It's impossible to overstate how bonkers the idea of sabotaging cryptography is to people who understand information security,"" said Mr Doctorow. ""Use deliberately compromised cryptography, that has a back door that only the 'good guys' are supposed to have the keys to, and you have effectively no security."" Even if app-makers were ordered to stop using encryption, it would be very difficult to stop criminals encrypting their messages manually, or writing them in code. On Sunday, Mrs May said large internet companies provided a ""safe space"" for extremist ideology to breed. Earlier this year, aHome Affairs Select Committee reportsaid social networks were ""shamefully far"" from tackling illegal and dangerous content and took too long to remove offending posts. The volume of material uploaded to Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and other social networks is astonishing, making it difficult to moderate. YouTube says 400 hours worth of video are uploaded to its platform every minute, making it impossible to review every clip a user posts. Hundreds of hours of video are uploaded to YouTube every minute The Open Rights Group, which campaigns for online freedoms, said governments and companies should ""take sensible measures to stop abuse"" but warned that ""attempts to control the internet"" would be difficult to enforce. Technology companies have defended their handling of extremist content following the London terror attack. YouTube told the BBC that it received 200,000 reports of inappropriate content a day, but managed to review 98% of them within 24 hours. It said hate speech made up a small proportion of the ""tens of millions"" of videos it removed every year. Facebook said: ""Using a combination of technology and human review, we work aggressively to remove terrorist content from our platform as soon as we become aware of it - and if we become aware of an emergency involving imminent harm to someone's safety, we notify law enforcement."" It said it actively worked to identify extremist accounts and worked with rivals Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube to help identify such content. Both Facebook and Google have stated that extremist content has no place on their websites. Germany hastried to further motivateinternet giants, by threatening them with fines of up to 50m euros (Â£43.5m) if they fail to remove hate speech quickly. However, the Open Rights Group warned that tough regulation by governments ""could push these vile networks into even darker corners of the web, where they will be even harder to observe"".

"Police in a suburb of Melbourne, Australia have shot dead a man after a hostage situation at an apartment building. Officers went to the address in Brighton after reports of an explosion - they found one man already dead in a stairwell. Another man holding a woman against her will was found inside the building. Specialist police began negotiations but officers then stormed the building and shot the hostage-taker dead. Three officers received non-life threatening injuries in the operation, one requiring hospital treatment. The woman was rescued unharmed. The area has been cordoned off and people are being advised to stay away. Victoria Police said,externalthey were investigating whether the incident was terror-related.

"Run, Hide: Police used prepared tactic to clear area Three terror attacks on the UK in 75 days. Thirty-four people dead, many, many more injured. The five attackers all dead too. By my calculations, this is the most sustained and bloody series of attacks outside of Northern Ireland since the IRA's 1974 winter bombing campaign  - although there have been bigger individual attacks, such as the 7/7 London bombings in 2005. While the motive and aim has been the same, each appalling incident has differed significantly from the last. These differences reveal the challenges faced by the security services in intercepting them before it is too late. What we know so far: The facts of the attack The Khalid Masood Westminster attack was the act of a man acting alone. His target was not only people around Westminster, but those inside Parliament's grounds too. Then, last month in Manchester we had another lone attacker. His target was entirely different: not a high-profile government building, but kids on a night out. This weekend's attack in London was quite different again: this time, three men acting together. They eschewed well-secured public places and targeted an obvious crowded area. Both bridge attacks shared a methodology that's been repeatedly promoted by jihadist groups like the self-styled Islamic State/Daesh: a vehicle to knock people over and knives once on foot. This is not new - it was how Fusilier Lee Rigby was murdered four years ago. Approximately half of the 18 foiled plots since 2013 - some of which we cannot currently report for legal reasons - have involved some combination of these techniques. Police spend a lot of time trying to work out whether they can spot people involved in ""hostile reconnaissance"" - observing places they want to attack. So a priority for the investigation will be to establish whether the three men carried out any such planning - or did they simply make it up as they went along on the night: looking for crowds, looking for targets. Lone attackers can be harder to stop than groups of attackers because, quite simply, they can keep their plans in their head. But groups make mistakes. It's hard for them to avoid detection thanks to a combination of factors, including the time it takes to organise themselves, tip-offs from a worried neighbour and the computing power of modern eavesdropping. So how did these men manage to plan without being noticed? We've also learnt that the routes to choosing extreme violence can be quite different. The Westminster Bridge attacker once appeared on the fringes of another investigation, but he had been dormant for many years. What was the trigger for him to attack, given he was acting alone? Manchester bomber Salman Abedi was different. His route to extremism appears to be intertwined with the verycomplex revolutionary Islamist politics of Libya. We know very little about the London bridge attackers so far. At least one of the men, whom we are not naming at this stage, once associated with one of the most notorious groups ever seen in the UK. This is perhaps the least surprising route to radicalisation of all three attackers. The group has been partly broken up. But did a latent threat from one of its occasional followers go unnoticed? This video can not be played ""Get down"" - police enter bar at London Bridge The security service, which was apparently alerted to the Manchester bomber's extremist views three times, is already examining how it dealt with those warnings - but did it miss something in this case too? Two final things we have learned. Eyewitness have told how the police relied upon a tactic to protect the public in the event of a marauding attack. Officers tried to rapidly clear the area by telling people to ""run"" to a safe area. Those they could not safely move - people in restaurants and bars - were told to ""hide"". One of the attackers who was shot Eight minutes after the first 999 call, the killers, wearing what looked like suicide bombs, had been gunned down by specialist officers who fired 50 rounds. That is almost half the time it took an armed team to reach Fusilier Lee Rigby's killers in 2013. The final issue that may now come to the fore is politics. Since 2001, the range and scope of counter-terrorism powers has expanded considerably. In her Sunday statement, the Prime Minister talked about ""enough is enough"". It hadechoes of Tony Blair's famous speech,externalfollowing the 7/7 bombings in which he said the ""rules of the game had changed"". This video can not be played Prime Minister Theresa May: ""Enough is enough' He promised a range of powers to deal not just with violence extremism, but those he said provided it with an ideological breeding ground. His government ultimately found some of the measures legally too difficult to implement. Theresa May has talked on and off since 2015 about measures to combat those who ""reject our values"" - but legislation hasn't yet appeared.

"Few people openly admit to holding racist beliefs but many psychologists claim most of us are nonetheless unintentionally racist.  We hold, what are called ""implicit biases"".  So what is implicit bias, how is it measured and what, if anything, can be done about it? David Edmonds has been investigating. ""Your data suggests a slight automatic preference for white people over black people."" That was hardly the result I'd hoped for.  So am I racist?  A bigot?  That would be rather at odds with my self-image.  But perhaps it's something I need to own up to? I'd just taken the Implicit Association Test (IAT), which is a way to identify implicit bias. And not just race bias, but also, for example, bias against gay, disabled or obese people. For those who've never taken an IAT, it works a bit like this - using the race IAT as an example.  You're shown words and faces.  The words may be positive ones (""terrific"", ""friendship"", ""joyous"", ""celebrate"") or negative (""pain"", ""despise"", ""dirty"", ""disaster"").  In one part of the process you have to press a key whenever you see either a black face or a bad word, and press another key when you see either a white face or a good word.  Then it switches round:  one key for a black face and good words.  Another for white faces and bad words.  That's a lot to keep in your head.  And here's the rub.  You've got to hit the appropriate key as fast as possible.  The computer measures your speed. You cantake the test here,external. The idea behind the IAT is that some categories and concepts may be more closely linked in our minds than others.  We may find it easier, and therefore quicker, to link black faces with nasty words than white faces with nasty words. Over the past few decades, measures of explicit bias have been falling rapidly.  For example, in Britain in the 1980s about 50% of the population stated that they opposed interracial marriages. That figurehad fallen to 15%,externalby 2011. The US has experienced a similarly dramatic shift. Going back to 1958, 94% of Americans said they disapproved of black-white marriage.  That hadfallen to just 11% by 2013,external. But implicit bias - bias that we harbour unintentionally - is much stickier, much more difficult to eradicate.  At least that's the claim. The IAT, first introduced two decades ago as a means of measuring implicit bias, is now used in laboratories all across the world.  From Harvard's Project Implicit site alone, it has been taken nearly 18 million times.  And there's a pattern.  My result was far from unique. On the race test, most people show some kind of pro-white, anti-black bias.  They are speedier connecting black faces to bad concepts than white faces. (Black people are not immune to this phenomenon themselves.) Implicit bias has been used to explain, at least partially, everything from the election of President Donald Trump (implicit bias against his female opponent) and the disproportionate number of unarmed black men who are shot in the US by police.  The notion that many of us suffer from various forms of implicit bias has become so commonplace that it was even mentioned by Hillary Clinton in one of her presidential debates with Trump. ""I think implicit bias is a problem for everyone,"" she said. Trump responded a week later. ""In our debate this week she accuses the entire country - essentially suggesting that everyone - including our police - are basically racist and prejudiced. It's a bad thing she said."" Indeed, it's hard to think of an experiment in social psychology which has had such far-reaching impact. Jules Holroyd, an expert in implicit bias at Sheffield University, traces some of the test's success to its providing an explanation ""for why exclusion and discrimination of various forms persist"". ""And that explanation,"" she adds, ""is really appealing since it doesn't need to attribute ill-will or animosity to the people who are implicated in such exclusion."" Over the past decade or so, it's become routine for major companies to use implicit association tests in their diversity training. The aim is to demonstrate to staff, particularly those with the power to recruit and promote, that unbeknown to them, and despite their best intentions, they may nonetheless be prejudiced.  The diversity training sector is estimated to be worth $8bn each year in the US alone. There's an obvious business case for eliminating bias.  If you can stop your staff behaving irrationally and prejudicially, you can employ and advance the best talent.  Implicit bias down = profits up. Listen to David Edmonds' radio documentary on Implicit Bias onAnalysis, on BBC Radio 4 at 20:30 on Monday 5 June Orcatch up afterwards on the BBC iPlayer However, pretty much everything about implicit bias is contentious, including very fundamental questions.  For example, there is disagreement about whether these states of mind are really unconscious.  Some psychologists believe that at some level we are aware of our prejudices. Then there's the IAT itself.  There are two main problems with it.  The first is what scientists call replicability.  Ideally a study which produces a certain result on a Monday should produce the same result on Tuesday.  But, says Greg Mitchell, a law professor at the University of Virginia, the replicability of the IAT is extremely poor.  If the test suggests that you have a strong implicit bias against African Americans, then ""if you take it even an hour or so later you'll probably get a very different score"".   One reason for this is that your score seems to be sensitive to circumstances in which you take it.   It's possible that your result will depend on whether you take the test before - or after - a hearty lunch. More fundamentally, there appears to a very tenuous relationship between the IAT and behaviour.  That is to say, if your colleague, Person A, does worse in the IAT than another colleague, Person B, it would be far too hasty to conclude that Person A will exhibit more discriminatory behaviour in the workplace.  In so far as there is a link between the IAT and behaviour generally, it is shaky. Defenders of the IAT counter that even a weak correlation between IAT and behaviour matters.  Naturally, human behaviour is hugely complex; we are influenced by numerous factors, including the weather, our mood, our blood-sugar levels.  But each day there are millions of employment decisions, legal judgements and student assessments.  If even a small fraction of these were infected by implicit bias, the numbers affected overall would be significant. Over the past few years, the pro- and anti-IAT scholars have lobbed various competing research papers at each other.  One study looked at black and white patients with cardiovascular symptoms: the puzzle was why doctors often treated black and white patients differently.  Researchers found that whether doctors treated races differently was correlated with how they performed on the IAT.  Another study presented participants with white and black faces followed by pictures of either a gun or some other object.  The task was to identify as quickly as possible whether the object was actually a gun.  It turned out that people were more likely to identify a non-gun object as a gun if this had been preceded by a picture of a black person.  What's more, this was linked to the IAT: poor IAT performers were prone to make more errors. But those who are sceptical about the idea of a link between behaviour and the IAT cite other studies.  One experiment purported to show that police officers who performed poorly on the IAT were not more likely to shoot unarmed black suspects than unarmed white suspects.  And as for the diversity industry, research and opinion differs about whether raising awareness of possible bias helps resolve the problem, or actually makes it worse, by making people more race-conscious.  According to Greg Mitchell, ""The evidence right now is that these programmes are not having any direct effects on implicit bias or on behaviour."" It's a confusing picture.  But putting the contentious IAT to one side, many scholars claim that there are other ways to identify implicit bias.  ""The IAT is not the only paradigm in which we observe unintentional bias, and so even if it did turn out that the IAT is a poor measure of unintentional bias, that doesn't imply that the phenomenon isn't real,"" says philosopher Sophie Stammers, of Birmingham University. There have been studies, for example, showing employers are more likely to respond positively to CVs with male names rather than female, or with stereotypically white names than black. Meanwhile, Sarah Jane Leslie, from Princeton, has produced some fascinating research into why some academic disciplines - such as maths, physics and her own area, philosophy - have such a paucity of women.  Her explanation is that some disciplines - such as philosophy - emphasise the need for raw brilliance to be successful, while others - such as history - are more likely to stress the importance of dedication and hard work. ""Since there are cultural stereotypes that link men more than women with that kind of raw brilliance"", Leslie says, ""we predicted and indeed found that those disciplines that emphasise brilliance were disciplines in which there were far fewer women.""  In popular culture, it is hard to think of a female equivalent to Sherlock Holmes, for example, a detective whose astonishing deductions were a product of his singular genius. How early in our lives do we absorb these cultural stereotypes?  Sarah Jane Leslie conducted one study with children.  Boys and girls were told about a person who was really clever, and given no clue as to the person's gender.  Then they were shown four pictures, two women and two men, and were asked which of these people was the clever person.  Aged five, boys and girls were just as likely to pick out a man than a woman. Within a year the culture in which we swim appears to have had an effect. ""Aged six,"" says Leslie, ""girls are significantly less likely than boys to think that a member of their own gender can be that really, really smart person."" The claim that most of us suffer from various forms of implicit bias is all of a piece with the explosion of research into the irrationality of our reasoning, decisions and beliefs.  We are not the cogent, systematic and logical creatures we might like to assume.  The findings of the IAT, and findings on implicit bias more generally, are unquestionably important.  But there's still a lot we don't know.  We still need a lot more rigorous research into how implicit bias interacts with behaviour, and how it can best be overcome. Two weeks after taking my first IAT test, I took it again.  I again showed a bias, but this time in favour of African-Americans.  That's left me more puzzled than ever.  I still don't really know whether I'm racist. Join the conversation - find us onFacebook,external,Instagram,external,Snapchat,externalandTwitter,external.

"Do clouds hang over the country's airline and broader economy? Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Libya, Yemen and the Maldiveshave cut diplomatic ties with Qatar. But what might this mean for Qatar's economy and people doing business there? With a population of about 2.7 million people, this tiny nation on the north-east coast of the Arabian Peninsula is trying to punch above its weight. People know about it thanks in part to its national airline (Qatar Airways), its international news station (Al Jazeera) and through sport (notably winning the right to host the 2022 football World Cup and being a former sponsor of perhaps the world's most famous club, Barcelona). And with a distinctive skyline in the capital Doha, it has succeeded in attracting multinationals to open offices there. So these latest developments mean there's a lot at stake. Abu Dhabi's Etihad Airways and Dubai's Emirates are suspending all flights to and from Doha, starting from Tuesday morning. Both carriers operate four daily return flights to Doha. Budget carriers FlyDubai and Air Arabia are also cancelling routes to Doha, with other airlines, including Bahrain's Gulf Air and Egyptair expected to follow suit. It comes after Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt all said they would stop flights in and out of Qatar, and close their airspace to the country's airline, Qatar Airways. And it is Qatar's flag carrier that risks being the biggest loser. Its flights to places like Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Riyadh and Cairo will stop. That is dozens of flights a day. This video can not be played Qatar Airways passengers in Abu Dhabi vent frustration Qatar Airways has already said it is cancelling its services to Saudi. It said: ""All customers booked on affected flights to and from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia will be provided with alternative options, including the option of a full refund on any unused tickets and free rebooking to the nearest alternative Qatar Airways network destination."" But being banned from large chunks of airspace in the region would also cause a major problem, forcing it to alter flight paths, inevitably adding time to some flights. And as well as cranking up fuel bills, that could annoy passengers. Qatar Airways' growth has come through positioning itself as a hub airline, connecting Asia and Europe via Doha. ""If a journey to Europe that used to take six hours now takes eight or nine because it has had to change routes, then that makes it far less appealing and passengers might look elsewhere,"" says Ghanem Nuseibeh, director at advisory firm Cornerstone Global. British Airways is one of a number of European airlines to fly to Doha. It said on Monday that it will ""continue to offer a full schedule. Desert states, by their nature, struggle to grow food. And food security is a particular issue for Qatar given the only way in by land is a single border with Saudi Arabia. Every day hundreds of lorries cross the border, and food is one of the main supplies. About 40% of Qatar's food is believed to come via this route. Saudi Arabia has said it will close that border and when the lorries stop, Qatar will become reliant on air and sea freight. ""It will immediately cause inflation and that will directly affect normal Qatari people,"" says Mr Nuseibeh. ""If things start costing significantly more, then you're going to see the Qatari people putting increasing political pressure on the ruling family for either a change of leadership or a change of direction."" The 2022 World Cup is helping fuel a construction boom in Qatar He also points out that many poorer Qataris make daily or weekly trips to Saudi to do their grocery shopping as it is cheaper. Clearly a closed border means this will no longer be possible. A new port, a medical zone, a metro project and eight stadiums for the 2022 World Cup are just some of the major construction projects going on in Qatar right now. Key materials, including concrete and steel come in by ship but also by land from neighbouring Saudi. The closure of that border could, as with food - push up prices and lead to delays. A materials shortage is already a threat that looms over Qatar's construction industry. This risks making things worse. A lengthy closure of the airspace and land borders would ""wreak havoc on the timeline and delivery"" of the World Cup, says Kristian Ulrichsen, a Gulf expert at the US-based Baker Institute. The move to end ties bans citizens from Saudi, Egypt, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Libya and Yemen from travelling to Qatar, living there or passing through it, according to the Saudi government. People affected have 14 days to leave. Meanwhile Qataris will have the same amount of time to get out of Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Bahrain. More significant though would be if Egypt issued a similar ban. According toone recent report,externalabout 180,000 Egyptians live in Qatar - with many involved in engineering, medicine and law as well as construction. A loss of that workforce would pose a problem for both local and international firms operating in the Gulf state.

"Adrian Fisher sitting in one of his mirror mazes Have you ever walked through a maze and wondered who makes them? Adrian Fisher is the world's leading maze designer, having created more than 700 mazes across 32 countries since 1979. ""I really do love my job,"" says the 65-year-old. ""It's like I'm a big kid, and creating things that people can play in all day long - who wouldn't want to do that?"" From his studio in Dorset, in south-west England, Mr Fisher has spent the past 38 years designing mazes in a wide variety of forms. From classical hedge mazes, to vast maize mazes and mirror mazes full of special effects, he continues to be much in demand. And there seems to be no job too small, or too outlandish, as his work ranges from tiny finger mazes that you can trace with a single digit, to an entire side of the 210m (689ft) tall Al Rostamani Maze Tower that was completed in Dubai in 2011. But how do you ever become a maze designer? For Mr Fisher it was a lucky turn in the maze we all walk through in life. Hedge mazes have to be grown for a number of years before they can open Mr Fisher first made a maze as a child, when he and his dad build one in their garden just for fun, but he ""never thought it would turn into a career"". Instead he started his adult life working as an accountant, while designing mazes as a hobby. His lucky break came aged 27 when he had a chance meeting with the late Lady Elizabeth Brunner, who said she wanted a maze built at her home Greys Court in Oxfordshire, which she had donated to the National Trust. Mr Fisher managed to land the gig, and he co-designed and built the ""turf maze"", a paved path cut into grass, with fellow maze designer Randoll Coate. From there Mr Fisher never looked back and he quit the world of accountancy. His business Adrian Fisher Design has four permanent employees, with a further 15 people typically working with them at any given time, including illustrators, designers and builders. He designs everything from finger mazes to giant cornfield mazes Over the past decade he says that modern technology and particularly the internet has made his job much easier. ""I work with animators in Spain and designers in Asia, and things like Skype make it so easy to feel like you're in the same room as them. ""This has really allowed me access to worldwide collaborators and markets including the US and [Asian cities such as] Kolkata, Shanghai and Yokohama. ""This gives us the flexibility to adjust production methods and timescales to suit each project. Also, local fabrication minimises import duties within our principal markets."" The cost of each maze varies greatly. A simple finger maze can be commissioned for just Â£100, but Mr Fisher's biggest projects, such as huge hedge mazes, will set you back more than Â£1m. Mr Fisher's mazes are installed around the world, such as this one in the Czech Republic In addition to deep pockets, patience is also required, particularly for the hedge mazes, which can take years to grow before they can be used. One such project, the Murray Star Maze at Scone Palace in Scotland, is made of beech trees which took seven years to grow into hedges of sufficient height. Some 90% of Mr Fisher's business is overseas, and he says that so far the UK's decision to leave the EU has had a beneficial impact on his company. ""Brexit has been positive even in the short term, since with a keener pound we are winning more export deals."" Mr Fisher works with designers and other workers around the world to make his creations In terms of competitors, Mr Fisher says he has around 20. ""But many of them just concentrate on one type of maze, and we do pretty much it all."" Mr Fisher has also built up his profile with some record-breaking exploits, and has held the world record for the world's largest cornfield maze no less than six times. Earlier this year, his Butterfly Maze in Ningbo, Chinaset the world record,externalfor the largest permanent hedge maze, with a total area of 33,565 sq m (8.3 acres) and total path length of 8.38 km (5.2 miles). In addition he has written 12 books about mazes, and gives both after-dinner talks on the subject, and talks to design students. MoreThe Bossfeatures, which every week profile a different business leader from around the world: Fancy a four flowers or ginger fried pork pizza? The boss who lives as a medieval knight The bad news that inspired a woman's sparkling success Kenny Rogers prepares to hang up his microphone Design expert Ania Choroszczynska, founder of London-based Anya Fennet Design, says Mr Fisher has taken mazes to ""new levels"". ""They [Adrian Fisher Design] understand the scope of the industry and the demands of the consumer or client, and create designs that have had a great reaction,"" she says. Mr Fisher has held the record for the world's largest cornfield maze six times With technology playing an increasing role in people's lives, does Mr Fisher feel that physical mazes will have a lasting future? ""We'll always have competition from new computer games etc, but nothing beats solving a real puzzle. Plus, it's a bonding experience as a group of people have to make choices and act together on the collective decision."" But if anyone has ever got lost in a maze and panicked, Mr Fisher can empathise. When his yew tree maze opened at Leeds Castle in Kent in 1988 he was leading a royal party including Princess Alexandra (a cousin of the Queen) around when he couldn't find his way out. ""Unfortunately since my previous visit the head gardener had closed a gap in one place,"" he says. ""With such confidence I led them into the maze but then got us all stuck. Thankfully I got us all out of there though. ""Somehow I managed to regain my composure and say it was so difficult a puzzle that even a maze designer could get lost.""

"Qatar's government said it believed the move was ""unjustified"" A number of Arab countries including Saudi Arabia and Egypt have cut diplomatic ties with Qatar, accusing it of destabilising the region. They say Qatar backs militant groups including so-called Islamic State (IS) and al-Qaeda, which Qatar denies. The Saudi state news agency SPA said Riyadh had closed its borders, severing land, sea and air contact with the tiny peninsula of oil-rich Qatar. Qatar called the decision ""unjustified"" and with ""no basis in fact"". The unprecedented move is seen as a major split between powerful Gulf countries, who are also close US allies. It comes amid heightened tensions between Gulf countries and their near-neighbour, Iran. TheSaudi statement,externalaccused Qatar of collaborating with ""Iranian-backed terrorist groups"" in its restive eastern region of Qatif and in Bahrain. The diplomatic withdrawal was first put into motion by Bahrain, then Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Egypt, Yemen, Libya's eastern-based government and the Maldives all followed suit. SPA cited officials as saying the decision was taken to ""protect its national security from the dangers of terrorism and extremism"". The diplomatic crisis is likely to disrupt Qatar's food imports from Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Bahrain have given all Qatari visitors and residents two weeks to leave their territory. The three countries have also banned their citizens from travelling to Qatar. However, Saudi Arabia says it will still allow Qataris to take part in the annual Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca. So far, there has been no sign of reciprocal moves by Qatar. In the latest developments: The UAE and Egypt have given Qatari diplomats 48 hours to leave both countries Airlines from many of the affected countries, including EgyptAir, Etihad Airways and Emirates, said they are to cancel flights to and from the Qatari capital Doha The Gulf allies said they had closed their airspace to Qatar Airways, which has suspended all its flights to Saudi Arabia Bahrain's state news agency said it was cutting its ties because Qatar was ""shaking the security and stability of Bahrain and meddling in its affairs"" The Saudi-led Arab coalition fighting Yemen's Houthi rebels also expelled Qatar from its alliance because of its ""practices that strengthen terrorism"" and its support of extremist groups. Why this row has erupted Food, flights and football at risk US President Trump met Egyptian President Sisi and Saudi King Salman in Saudi Arabia two weeks ago While the severing of ties was sudden, it has not come out of the blue, as tensions have been building for years, and particularly in recent weeks. Two weeks ago, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the UAEblocked Qatari news sites, including Al Jazeera. Comments purportedly by Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani criticising Saudi Arabia had appeared on Qatari state media. The government in Doha dismissed the comments as fake, attributing the report to a ""shameful cybercrime"". Back in 2014, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the UAE withdrew their ambassadors from Qatar for several months in protest over alleged interference in their affairs. 'A Qatarstrophe' - social media reacts All you need to know about Qatar The story behind Qatar 'hack' More broadly, two key factors drove Monday's decision: Qatar's ties to Islamist groups, and the role of Iran, Saudi Arabia's regional rival. While Qatar has joined the US coalition against IS, the Qatari government has repeatedly denied accusations from Iraq's Shia leaders that it provided financial support to IS. Wealthy individuals in the country are believed to have made donations and the government has given money and weapons to hardline Islamist groups in Syria. Qatar is also accused of having links to a group formerly known as the Nusra Front, an al-Qaeda affiliate. The SPA statement accused Qatar of backing these groups, as well as the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood - banned in Gulf countries as a terrorist organisation - and that it ""promotes the message and schemes of these groups through their media constantly"". Saudi Arabia itself is a key backer of Islamist rebels, including hardline jihadist groups, in Syria. Where key countries stand on IS Where does IS get its support? While on a visit to Riyadh two weeks ago, US President Donald Trump urged Muslim countries to take the lead in combating radicalisation,and blamed Iranfor instability in the Middle East. ""It seems that the Saudis and Emiratis feel emboldened by the alignment of their regional interests - toward Iran and Islamism - with the Trump administration,"" Gulf analyst Kristian Ulrichsen told Reuters news agency. ""[They] have decided to deal with Qatar's alternative approach on the assumption that they will have the [Trump] administration's backing."" Is Saudi to blame for IS? Saudi Arabia, too, has been accused of funding IS, either directly or by failing to prevent private donors from sending money to the group - allegations it denies. In recent days, British Prime Minister Theresa May has also come under pressure from election rivals to publish a report thought to focus on the funding of UK extremist groups by Saudi Arabia. Qatar, which is due to host the football World Cup in 2022, was critical of the decision. The foreign ministry said the decisions would ""not affect the normal lives of citizens and residents"". US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, speaking in Sydney, urged the countries to resolve their differences through dialogue. This video can not be played US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson urges Gulf states to ""address differences"" Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi said there was a need for ""transparent dialogue and diplomacy"", adding: ""No country in the region will benefit from the heightened tension."" Qatar's stock market closed down 7.27%. One of the likely knock-on effectsis on food stability: about 40% of Qatar's food is believed to come  by lorry from Saudi Arabia. The Doha News newspaperreported,externalthat people had rushed to supermarkets to stock up on food and water. Nearly 90% of Qatar's population are migrant workers, many of whom are working on the construction boom fuelled by the successful World Cup bid. There have long been tensions not far beneath the surface. Qatar has often seemed out of step with its neighbours. It has tended, for example, to side with Islamist forces in the Middle East - like the Muslim Brotherhood, which is reviled by the Saudis and the current Egyptian leadership. Past efforts by the neighbours to pull the Qataris into line have had limited impact. But now Doha has suddenly come under much greater and more co-ordinated pressure. Emboldened by President Trump's trip two weeks ago, the Saudis and the Emiratis believe that this is the moment to make clear to Qatar that its divergent views will no longer be tolerated. And right now this small country's rulers will probably be feeling very lonely indeed. What's behind crisis with Qatar?

"Imagine we could control the weather - pushing a button to make it warmer or cooler, wetter or drier. The implications would be enormous. No more droughts or floods, no heat waves or icy roads. Deserts would become verdant. Crops would never fail. In fact climate change has sparked some crazy-sounding ideas for hacking the climate, such as spraying sulphuric acid into the upper atmosphere, or dumping quicklime in the oceans. Clever as humans are, however, we're nowhere near precision control of the weather. Outside, at least. Since the invention of air conditioning, we have been able to control the weather inside, and that has had some some far-reaching and unexpected effects. 50 Things That Made the Modern Economyhighlights the inventions, ideas and innovations which have helped create the economic world in which we live. It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can findmore information about the programme's sourcesandlisten onlineorsubscribe to the programme podcast. Ever since our ancestors mastered fire, humans have been able to warm themselves. Cooling down when it's hot has been more challenging. The eccentric Roman emperor Elagabulus sent slaves to bring snow down from the mountains and pile it in his garden, where breezes would carry the cooler air inside. Needless to say, this was not a scalable solution. At least, not until the 19th century, when Boston entrepreneur Frederic Tudor amassed an unlikely fortune doing something similar. He took blocks of ice from frozen New England lakes in winter, insulated them in sawdust, and shipped them to warmer climes for summer. Until artificial ice-making took off, mild New England winters caused panic about an ""ice famine"". Air conditioning as we know it began in 1902, but it had nothing to do with human comfort. New York's Sackett & Wilhelms Lithographing and Printing Company became frustrated with varying humidity levels when trying to print in colour. Sackett & Wilhelms asked a heating company to solve their humidity problem The same paper had to be printed four times in four colours, and if the humidity changed between print runs, the paper would slightly expand or contract. Even a millimetre's misalignment looked awful. The printers asked heating company Buffalo Forge to devise a system to control humidity. A young engineer called Willis Carrier figured out that circulating air over coils that were chilled by compressed ammonia maintained the humidity at a constant 55%. Willis Carrier was quick to see the wider potential of his humidity-controlling invention The printers were delighted. Buffalo Forge was soon selling Willis Carrier's invention wherever humidity posed problems, such as to flour mills and the Gillette corporation, where excessive moisture rusted the razor blades. These early industrial clients didn't much care about making temperatures more tolerable for their workers - that was an incidental benefit. Carrier's original drawings for the system he designed for Sackett & Wilhelms But by 1906, Carrier was exploring the potential for ""comfort"" applications in public buildings like theatres. It was an astute choice. Historically, theatres often shut down for summer: no windows, human bodies tightly packed together and, before electricity, lighting provided by flares. New England ice had been briefly popular. In the summer of 1880, New York's Madison Square Theatre used four tons a day: an eight-foot fan blew air over the ice and through ducts towards the audience. Unfortunately, though cool, the air was also damp, and with pollution increasing in New England's lakes, the melting ice sometimes released unpleasant smells. Willis Carrier's ""Weathermaker"" was much more practical. The general public first experienced air conditioning in the burgeoning movie theatres of the 1920s, and it quickly became as much of a selling point as the films. The enduring Hollywood tradition of the summer blockbuster traces directly back to Carrier, as does the rise of the shopping mall. But air conditioning has become more than a mere convenience. It is a transformative technology, which has had a profound influence on where and how we live. Computers fail if they get too hot or damp, so air conditioning enables the server farms that power the internet. Indeed, if factories couldn't control their air quality, we'd struggle to manufacture silicon chips at all. Air conditioning has also revolutionised architecture. Historically, a cool building in a hot climate implied thick walls, high ceilings, balconies, courtyards and windows facing away from the sun. The invention of air conditioning radically altered housing in America's so-called ""sun belt"" The dogtrot house, popular in America's south, was bisected by a covered, open-ended corridor to let breezes through. Before air conditioning, glass-fronted skyscrapers were not a sensible option: you'd bake on the upper floors. Air conditioning has changed demographics, too. It's hard to imagine the rise of cities like Dubai or Singapore without it. As residential units spread rapidly across America in the second half of the 20th century, the population in the ""sun belt"" - the warmer south of the country, from Florida to California - boomed from 28% of Americans to 40%. As retirees in particular moved from north to south, they also changed the region's political balance. The authorSteven Johnson has plausibly argued that air conditioning elected Ronald Reagan,external. How a razor revolutionised the way we pay for stuff TV Dinner: The hidden cost of the processed food revolution The tiny pill which gave birth to an economic revolution How the lift transformed the shape of our cities Reagan came to power in 1980, a time when America used more than half the world's air conditioning. Emerging economies have since caught up quickly: China will soon become the global leader. The proportion of air-conditioned homes in Chinese cities jumped from under a tenth to more than two-thirds in just 10 years. In countries like India, Brazil and Indonesia, the market for air conditioners is expanding at double-digit rates. And there's plenty more room for growth: 11 of the world's 30 largest cities are in the tropics. The boom in air conditioning is good news for many reasons. Studies show that it lowers mortality during heat waves. Heat makes prison inmates fractious - air conditioning pays for itself by reducing fights. When the temperature exceeds 21C or 22C in exam halls, students start to score lower in maths tests. In offices, air conditioning makes us more productive: according to one early study, it made US government typists do 24% more work. Economists have since confirmed that relationship between productivity and keeping cool. William Nordhaus divided the world into cells, by lines of latitude and longitude, and plotted each one's climate, output and population.The hotter the average temperature, he found, the less productive the people,external. According to Geoffrey Heal and Jisung Park,external, a hotter-than-average year is bad for productivity in hot countries, but good in cold ones. They conclude that human productivity peaks at between 18C and 22C. But there's an inconvenient truth: you can only make it cooler inside by making it warmer outside. A study in Phoenix, Arizona, found the hot air pumped out of air conditioning units increased the city's night-time temperature by 2C, Of course, that makes air conditioning units work harder, making the outside hotter still. On underground metro systems, cooling the trains can lead to swelteringly-hot platforms. Then there's the electricity that powers air conditioning - often made by burning gas or coal -  and the coolants air conditioners use, many of which are powerful greenhouse gases when they leak. Air conditioning technology is getting cleaner and greener. But demand is growing so quickly that - even if the optimists are right about possible efficiency gains - there'll be an eightfold increase in energy consumption by 2050. That's worrying news for climate change. When will we get inventions to control the outdoor weather, too?

"Jeremy Corbyn has said Theresa May should pay a price in Thursday's general election for ignoring ""repeated warnings"" not to cut police numbers. The Labour leader said Mrs May had ""presided"" over a 19,000 fall in numbers as home secretary and he agreed with those calling on her to resign in the wake of the London Bridge attacks. But the PM said she had protected counter-terror police numbers. And she accused the Labour leader of opposing shoot-to-kill powers. With less than 72 hours to go before Thursday's election, party leaders have returned to the campaign trail after electioneering was briefly suspended because of the London Bridge attack, in which seven people died. BBC Election Live: Rolling updates Guide: Where the parties stand on security Police 'know identity of London attackers' How has armed policing changed? How terror attack will influence campaign Following a meeting of senior ministers and security chiefs at the emergency Cobra committee, Mrs May said Saturday's atrocity was an attack on ""the free world"" and said she was best equipped to deal with the ""evolving"" threat facing the UK. In a speech in London, she vowed to tackle the ""whole spectrum"" of extremism, promising action in communities and online to ensure ""bigotry and hatred"" did not escalate into violence. This video can not be played Culture secretary Karen Bradley says police funding was part of ""difficult decisions"" made by government She defended her record on security over the past seven years in the face of criticism that she had presided, as home secretary, over a fall of 18,991 in police numbers between September 2010 and 2016 and that she had accused officers of ""crying wolf"" over their capabilities. She said she had protected counter-terror police budgets as home secretary and was now ""providing funding for an uplift in the number of armed officers"" as well as protecting funding for the police as a whole. Insisting strong leadership was ""absolutely vital"" for keeping the UK safe, she said Mr Corbyn had ""boasted"" of opposing all counter-terrorism legislation as a backbench MP and had voiced his opposition to shoot-to-kill powers, saying the rapid response of the police to Saturday's attack showed how vital these were. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn backs calls for Theresa May to resign But as he embarked on a whirlwind series of campaign events planned for the next 72 hours, Mr Corbyn said there was ""deep anger"" at the number of police and firefighters who had lost their jobs in recent years. Asked whether he agreed with a call by some, including former Downing Street adviser Steve Hilton, for Mrs May to quit, he said he did, but added that the ""best way"" for the issue to be dealt with was by voters on Thursday. ""There is an election, everybody has a choice. A lot of people are very angry and would have wanted her to resign were she still home secretary. ""The choice is going to be made on Thursday by the people of this country."" Analysis -BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg Voters choose their political parties for all sorts of different reasons. But as this strange election hurtles towards its close, the demand of who can keep the country safe is firmly on the table. For Theresa May that doesn't just mean questions over how she would counter extremism if she stays in power. She faces criticism too over the Tories' record on squeezing money for the police. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has repeated his promise to reverse the cuts and slammed the Tories, warning the government could not ""protect the public on the cheap"". He also tried to counter perceptions that he is soft on security, including his earlier stance on shoot-to-kill, which he questioned days after the Paris attack at the Bataclan. He said, if he were prime minister he would take ""whatever action is necessary and effective"" to protect the public. After a brief pause, the election campaign is well and truly back, even if with a more subdued tone, and with security as its primary subject.

"Qatar's government said it believed the move was ""unjustified"" A number of Arab countries including Saudi Arabia and Egypt have cut diplomatic ties with Qatar, accusing it of destabilising the region. They say Qatar backs militant groups including so-called Islamic State (IS) and al-Qaeda, which Qatar denies. The Saudi state news agency SPA said Riyadh had closed its borders, severing land, sea and air contact with the tiny peninsula of oil-rich Qatar. Qatar called the decision ""unjustified"" and with ""no basis in fact"". The unprecedented move is seen as a major split between powerful Gulf countries, who are also close US allies. It comes amid heightened tensions between Gulf countries and their near-neighbour, Iran. TheSaudi statement,externalaccused Qatar of collaborating with ""Iranian-backed terrorist groups"" in its restive eastern region of Qatif and in Bahrain. The diplomatic withdrawal was first put into motion by Bahrain, then Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Egypt, Yemen, Libya's eastern-based government and the Maldives all followed suit. SPA cited officials as saying the decision was taken to ""protect its national security from the dangers of terrorism and extremism"". The diplomatic crisis is likely to disrupt Qatar's food imports from Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Bahrain have given all Qatari visitors and residents two weeks to leave their territory. The three countries have also banned their citizens from travelling to Qatar. However, Saudi Arabia says it will still allow Qataris to take part in the annual Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca. So far, there has been no sign of reciprocal moves by Qatar. In the latest developments: The UAE and Egypt have given Qatari diplomats 48 hours to leave both countries Airlines from many of the affected countries, including EgyptAir, Etihad Airways and Emirates, said they are to cancel flights to and from the Qatari capital Doha The Gulf allies said they had closed their airspace to Qatar Airways, which has suspended all its flights to Saudi Arabia Bahrain's state news agency said it was cutting its ties because Qatar was ""shaking the security and stability of Bahrain and meddling in its affairs"" The Saudi-led Arab coalition fighting Yemen's Houthi rebels also expelled Qatar from its alliance because of its ""practices that strengthen terrorism"" and its support of extremist groups. Why this row has erupted Food, flights and football at risk US President Trump met Egyptian President Sisi and Saudi King Salman in Saudi Arabia two weeks ago While the severing of ties was sudden, it has not come out of the blue, as tensions have been building for years, and particularly in recent weeks. Two weeks ago, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the UAEblocked Qatari news sites, including Al Jazeera. Comments purportedly by Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani criticising Saudi Arabia had appeared on Qatari state media. The government in Doha dismissed the comments as fake, attributing the report to a ""shameful cybercrime"". Back in 2014, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the UAE withdrew their ambassadors from Qatar for several months in protest over alleged interference in their affairs. 'A Qatarstrophe' - social media reacts All you need to know about Qatar The story behind Qatar 'hack' More broadly, two key factors drove Monday's decision: Qatar's ties to Islamist groups, and the role of Iran, Saudi Arabia's regional rival. While Qatar has joined the US coalition against IS, the Qatari government has repeatedly denied accusations from Iraq's Shia leaders that it provided financial support to IS. Wealthy individuals in the country are believed to have made donations and the government has given money and weapons to hardline Islamist groups in Syria. Qatar is also accused of having links to a group formerly known as the Nusra Front, an al-Qaeda affiliate. The SPA statement accused Qatar of backing these groups, as well as the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood - banned in Gulf countries as a terrorist organisation - and that it ""promotes the message and schemes of these groups through their media constantly"". Saudi Arabia itself is a key backer of Islamist rebels, including hardline jihadist groups, in Syria. Where key countries stand on IS Where does IS get its support? While on a visit to Riyadh two weeks ago, US President Donald Trump urged Muslim countries to take the lead in combating radicalisation,and blamed Iranfor instability in the Middle East. ""It seems that the Saudis and Emiratis feel emboldened by the alignment of their regional interests - toward Iran and Islamism - with the Trump administration,"" Gulf analyst Kristian Ulrichsen told Reuters news agency. ""[They] have decided to deal with Qatar's alternative approach on the assumption that they will have the [Trump] administration's backing."" Is Saudi to blame for IS? Saudi Arabia, too, has been accused of funding IS, either directly or by failing to prevent private donors from sending money to the group - allegations it denies. In recent days, British Prime Minister Theresa May has also come under pressure from election rivals to publish a report thought to focus on the funding of UK extremist groups by Saudi Arabia. Qatar, which is due to host the football World Cup in 2022, was critical of the decision. The foreign ministry said the decisions would ""not affect the normal lives of citizens and residents"". US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, speaking in Sydney, urged the countries to resolve their differences through dialogue. This video can not be played US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson urges Gulf states to ""address differences"" Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi said there was a need for ""transparent dialogue and diplomacy"", adding: ""No country in the region will benefit from the heightened tension."" Qatar's stock market closed down 7.27%. One of the likely knock-on effectsis on food stability: about 40% of Qatar's food is believed to come  by lorry from Saudi Arabia. The Doha News newspaperreported,externalthat people had rushed to supermarkets to stock up on food and water. Nearly 90% of Qatar's population are migrant workers, many of whom are working on the construction boom fuelled by the successful World Cup bid. There have long been tensions not far beneath the surface. Qatar has often seemed out of step with its neighbours. It has tended, for example, to side with Islamist forces in the Middle East - like the Muslim Brotherhood, which is reviled by the Saudis and the current Egyptian leadership. Past efforts by the neighbours to pull the Qataris into line have had limited impact. But now Doha has suddenly come under much greater and more co-ordinated pressure. Emboldened by President Trump's trip two weeks ago, the Saudis and the Emiratis believe that this is the moment to make clear to Qatar that its divergent views will no longer be tolerated. And right now this small country's rulers will probably be feeling very lonely indeed. What's behind crisis with Qatar?

"Technology companies have defended their handling of extremist content following the London terror attack. Prime Minister Theresa May called for areas of the internet to be closed because tech giants had provided a ""safe space"" for terrorist ideology. But Google said it had already spent hundreds of millions of pounds on tackling the problem. Facebook and Twitter said they were working hard to rid their networks of terrorist activity and support. Google, which owns Youtube, along with Facebook, which owns WhatsApp, and Twitter were among the tech companies already facing pressure to tackle extremist content. That pressure intensified following Saturday night's attack, which killed seven people and injured 48. The so-called Islamic State group has claimed responsibility for the attack. Speaking outside Downing Street on Sunday, Mrs May said: ""We cannot allow this ideology the safe space it needs to breed. ""Yet that is precisely what the internet, and the big companies... provide."" Latest updates: London attack How IS wages its social media war Culture Secretary Karen Bradley said tech companies needed to tackle extremist content, in a similar way to how they had removed indecent images of children. ""We know it can be done and we know the internet companies want to do it,"" she told the BBC on Monday. This video can not be played Watch: How the attacks unfolded Google said it had invested heavily to fight abuse on its platforms and was already working on an ""international forum to accelerate and strengthen our existing work in this area"". The firm added that it shared ""the government's commitment to ensuring terrorists do not have a voice online"". Facebook said: ""Using a combination of technology and human review, we work aggressively to remove terrorist content from our platform as soon as we become aware of it - and if we become aware of an emergency involving imminent harm to someone's safety, we notify law enforcement."" Meanwhile, Twitter said ""terrorist content has no place on"" its platform. Home Secretary Amber Rudd said on Sunday that tech firms needed to take down extremist content and limit the amount of end-to-end encryption that terrorists can use. End-to-end encryption renders messages unreadable if they are intercepted, for example by criminals or law enforcement. Silicon Valley is both on the offensive and defensive. Defensive in that they are protecting their reputations as companies that put in a lot of work to stamp out extremist content online, but offensive in making it clear they do not feel ""kneejerk"" regulation is the way to solve the issue. The tech industry is mostly in agreement on this. They believe that end-to-end encryption, while perhaps frustrating to police, is a technology that means everyone's communications are far more secure. The logic put forward by experts is that if there's a way to break into a terrorist's smartphone without his permission - then there's a way to break into your smartphone too. On Monday, Apple will be holding its annual developers' conference in San Jose. I'm not expecting chief executive Tim Cook to talk about the issue - he won't want to willingly draw his company into the debate - but you can fully expect Apple to put its weight behind any movement that seeks to increase security. And the company will speak out, as it often has, against any attempts from authorities to compel tech firms to give them a so-called ""back door"" into their systems. The Open Rights Group, which campaigns for privacy and free speech online, warned that politicians risked pushing terrorists' ""vile networks"" into the ""darker corners of the web"" by more regulation. The way that supporters of jihadist groups use social media has changed ""despite what the prime minister says"", according to Dr Shiraz Maher of the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation (ICSR) at King's College London. They have ""moved to more clandestine methods"", withencrypted messaging app Telegramthe primary platform, Dr Maher told the BBC. Professor Peter Neumann, another director at the ICSR, wrote on Twitter: ""Blaming social media platforms is politically convenient but intellectually lazy."" However, Dr Julia Rushchenko, a London-based research fellow at the Henry Jackson Centre for the Response to Radicalisation and Terrorism, told the BBC that more could be done by tech giants to root out such content. She felt that the companies erred on the side of privacy, not security. ""We all know that social media companies have been a very helpful tool for hate preachers and for extremists,"" Dr Rushchenko said. Investors suggested that tech firms would be more willing to take further action against extremist content if shareholders and advertisers pressured them to do so. Jessica Ground, a UK fund manager at Schroders, told the BBC: ""It's going to be an interesting debate how you put the pressure points. It could be the money rather than the governments."" Simon Howard, chief executive of UKSIF - the UK Sustainable Investment and Finance Association, said: ""We'll need all the technology companies to do a bit more and we'll have to decide what the UK legal framework in which they do that is.""

"In the last week, we have seen the best and worst of computer technology. In China, Google's DeepMind artificial intelligence program took on and beat the world champion of the complex game of Go, reducing him to tears. Nineteen-year-old Ke Jie described the AI computer as ""perfect, flawless, without any emotions"". But in airports in the UK and elsewhere last weekend tears were also being shed over computers. In this case, though, the primary emotions were frustration and rage over the chaos caused when British Airways' IT system collapsed, leaving thousands of passengers going nowhere and their baggage stuck they knew not where. What is striking about both these cases is how difficult human beings found it to explain exactly what was happening inside the brains of the computers. British Airways' IT system collapse saw many passengers, and their baggage, grounded DeepMind's AlphaGo is largely self-taught - it was shown the basic rules of Go and then it spent time looking at millions of games and playing against itself, coming up with moves that astounded professional players and its creators. BA's computers were not so smart. The company says its problems began when there was a power surge at a data centre at Heathrow Airport in London. AlphaGo: Computer defeat 'painful' for Chinese Go prodigy What went wrong at BA? WannaCry ransomware cyber-attack: Your questions answered Microsoft warns ransomware cyber-attack is a wake-up call That shouldn't have been more than a temporary hitch - in fact one expert told me it should not have even set the lights blinking at the data centre - but it seems to have triggered a chain reaction which took out the entire system. That meant the sea of complex data about passengers, baggage and aircraft movements was effectively frozen - and it took 48 hours to unfreeze it and get the airline working again. Any major organisation is likely to have both a backup system to switch to when things go wrong and a disaster recovery plan, which should be rehearsed on a regular basis. But in British Airways' case neither appears to have worked as it should. The trade unions blame cost-cutting and the fact that BA outsourced much of its IT operation to India last year. Computers have revolutionised the world but are not flawless The bosses deny that and say they are now clear what went wrong - but so far, have been unable to give an explanation that seems satisfactory to people with expertise in how data centres and major IT operations work. But what is clear is that ever more areas of our lives are dependent on vast computer systems, often now hosted in data centres owned by companies like Amazon and Microsoft. These systems have become essential to industries from banking to travel to healthcare and they are helping them become more efficient - sometimes by getting much of the work done in countries like India where costs are lower. They are also making life better in all sorts of ways - just think of how time-consuming it used to be to book a flight or apply for a place at university and how much paper was involved. But now we are beginning to find out just how helpless we feel when, for whatever reason, the computers fail. Recent cyber-attacks have highlighted potential security problems in computer networks In Britain, doctors whose computers froze during the recent ransomware attack had to turn patients away. In Ukraine, there were power cuts when hackers attacked the electricity system, and five years ago, millions of Royal Bank of Scotland customers were unable to get at their money for days after problems with a software upgrade. Already some people have had enough. This week a letter to the Guardian newspaper warned that the modern world was ""dangerously exposed by this reliance on the internet and new technology"". The correspondent, quite possibly a retired government employee, continued ""there are just enough old-time civil servants left alive to turn back the clock and take away our dangerous dependence on modern technology."" Somehow, though, I don't see this happening. Airlines are not going to scrap the computers and tick passengers off on a paper list before they climb aboard, bank clerks will not be entering transactions in giant ledgers in copperplate writing. In fact, computers will take over more and more functions once restricted to humans, most of them far more useful than a game of Go. And that means that at home, at work and at play we will have to get used to seeing our lives disrupted when those clever machines suffer the occasional nervous breakdown.

"Police uncovered Matthew Leveson's remains in a national park Human remains found in dense Australian bush belong to a man who went missing nearly 10 years ago, police have said. Matthew Leveson, 20, was last seen leaving a Sydney nightclub in 2007 with his then boyfriend, Michael Atkins. Mr Atkins was acquitted of Mr Leveson's murder in 2009. He later made a deal giving him immunity from perjury if he gave information leading to the recovery of Mr Leveson's body. Mr Leveson's family thanked relatives after the discovery was confirmed. Police found the remains in Sydney's Royal National Park on Wednesday after scouring the bushland three times since November. DNA confirmed it was Mr Leveson, police said on Sunday. His parents, Faye and Mark Leveson, laid flowers at the site last week. ""We have had to fight for nine-and-a-half years to get to this day to bring our son home,"" Mrs Leveson told reporters. The couple visited the Royal National Park several times during the years spent searching for their son. ""Every time we were down there, they were down there,"" said Detective Chief Inspector Gary Jubelin from New South Wales Police. Under a deal struck with authorities, Mr Atkins was given indemnity from prosecution for perjury and contempt of court after he admitted lying at an inquest into Mr Leveson's death. Former NSW director of public prosecutions Nicholas Cowdrey told theAustralian Broadcasting Corp,externalthat the discovery of remains alone did not constitute ""any evidence of an offence"".

Sunday Express business editor Geoff Ho was injured trying to help a bouncer Sunday Express business editor Geoff Ho dragged his wounded friend to safety while at the Black & Blue restaurant in Southwark - despite himself being stabbed in the neck. Earlier that night, he had helped a bouncer at the Southwark Tavern being attacked by two unarmed men, but said in astatement on Tuesday that the incident happened before he confronted the terrorists,external. ""At that point I thought 'job done, now for beer and food',"" he said. ""Within two minutes of my leaving the Southwark Tavern and posting 'not on my watch' on Facebook, the terrorist attackers arrived at the restaurant. ""Most of my friends and the staff hid under tables but one of my friends was frozen behind me."" The journalist said he ""tried to slow"" the attackers, who appeared to be wearing suicide vests. Victims of the attack What we know so far Who were the attackers? ""I think I got a hit in on one of them, but either he or his accomplice got me with a shot to the throat. ""They got my friend who was behind me with a minor stab wound in the face and hands and ran off. ""I picked up my friend and bundled him into the store room. I called the police and within moments they arrived. I gave the police descriptions of the three and we were evacuated."" Footage of him being escorted to an ambulance,externalby police has been posted on the Daily Express website. In it he is clutching his neck and using his shirt as a bandage. Mr Ho said he would make a full recovery and thanked staff at the Royal London Hospital.

Ignacio EcheverrÃ­a, 39, saw the attack unfolding at London Bridge andrushed to help the woman. According to his father, friends saw the HSBC employee from Madrid, ""lying on the floor on the sidewalk after defending someone with his skateboard"".

PC Charlie Guenigault, pictured on the night of the London attack Off-duty police officer Charlie Guenigault - an amateur rugby player - was stabbed after tackling one of the three men. He was injured after rushing to the aid of a British Transport Police officer who had faced the attackers with only a baton. The family of the 25-year-old, who serves as an emergency response officer for the Southwark borough, said he ""showed immense bravery"". In a statement, they added: ""Given the opportunity again, Charlie would no doubt do exactly the same if faced with the same situation; helping a fellow police officer in need and protecting the public. ""He is immensely proud to work for the Metropolitan Police Service and serving the Southwark community, and this is an example of that. ""Charlie is described by his peers as a dedicated police officer, who is a diligent, hardworking and respected member of his team"".

She said: ""It's hard to pick out individual stories but I am immensely proud of him and what he did."" The BTP officer, who has not been named, was seriously injured but is now in a stable condition. Chief Constable Paul Crowther from the BTP said the bravery he showed was ""outstanding"".

When they told him that three men were stabbing people in the market, he headed outside with two crates to tackle the attackers. Speaking to the Victoria Derbyshire show, he said: ""I felt pity for the victims, I didn't know how to handle things or react, I thought to myself I'm also in danger. ""I just threw the crate at [one of the attackers]. ""I threw the first crate and I knew he was going to dodge it.

Carlos (left) and Giovanni were in a restaurant where an attacker stabbed a woman Giovanni Sagristani, 38, and his friends were in the El Pastor restaurant on Stoney Street when one of the attackers came in and stabbed a woman in the chest. ""He came in shouting and just stabbed her,"" he said. Mr Sagristani's partner Carlos Pinto, 33, who works as a critical care nurse in London, looked after the woman, with the help of his friend, another nurse. ""They took some ice and cloths and tried to stop the bleeding. She lost half a litre of blood in the beginning. He was keeping pressure on the wound,"" Mr Sagristani said. He said fellow diners had managed to push the attacker out of the restaurant by throwing chairs and bottles at him. Once the attacker was outside, staff lowered a security gate and locked people inside. Diners threw chairs and bottles at the attacker ""After the initial moment of panic, everyone tried to help this girl and stay calm. We were all at the back of the restaurant.

"A number of people put their safety at risk and helped others during Saturday's attack on London Bridge and Borough Market, which left eight people dead and 48 injured. Among them was a baker who wielded a bread crate at the attackers, as well as a man who used his skateboard to protect people, with supermarket workers offering free food and drink to emergency workers. Sunday Express business editor Geoff Ho was injured trying to help a bouncer Sunday Express business editor Geoff Ho dragged his wounded friend to safety while at the Black & Blue restaurant in Southwark - despite himself being stabbed in the neck. Earlier that night, he had helped a bouncer at the Southwark Tavern being attacked by two unarmed men, but said in astatement on Tuesday that the incident happened before he confronted the terrorists,external. ""At that point I thought 'job done, now for beer and food',"" he said. ""Within two minutes of my leaving the Southwark Tavern and posting 'not on my watch' on Facebook, the terrorist attackers arrived at the restaurant. ""Most of my friends and the staff hid under tables but one of my friends was frozen behind me."" The journalist said he ""tried to slow"" the attackers, who appeared to be wearing suicide vests. Victims of the attack What we know so far Who were the attackers? ""I think I got a hit in on one of them, but either he or his accomplice got me with a shot to the throat. ""They got my friend who was behind me with a minor stab wound in the face and hands and ran off. ""I picked up my friend and bundled him into the store room. I called the police and within moments they arrived. I gave the police descriptions of the three and we were evacuated."" Footage of him being escorted to an ambulance,externalby police has been posted on the Daily Express website. In it he is clutching his neck and using his shirt as a bandage. Mr Ho said he would make a full recovery and thanked staff at the Royal London Hospital. Ignacio had been cycling back from a park with two friends he had been skateboarding with when the attack began A Spanish man who used his skateboard to try to defend a woman who was being stabbed by one of the attackers has now been named as being one of the eight people killed. Ignacio EcheverrÃ­a, 39, saw the attack unfolding at London Bridge andrushed to help the woman. According to his father, friends saw the HSBC employee from Madrid, ""lying on the floor on the sidewalk after defending someone with his skateboard"". Spain's prime ministertweeted,externalthat he had requested that Mr Echeverria be granted Spain's Silver Cross of the Order of Civil Merit. PC Charlie Guenigault, pictured on the night of the London attack Off-duty police officer Charlie Guenigault - an amateur rugby player - was stabbed after tackling one of the three men. He was injured after rushing to the aid of a British Transport Police officer who had faced the attackers with only a baton. The family of the 25-year-old, who serves as an emergency response officer for the Southwark borough, said he ""showed immense bravery"". In a statement, they added: ""Given the opportunity again, Charlie would no doubt do exactly the same if faced with the same situation; helping a fellow police officer in need and protecting the public. ""He is immensely proud to work for the Metropolitan Police Service and serving the Southwark community, and this is an example of that. ""Charlie is described by his peers as a dedicated police officer, who is a diligent, hardworking and respected member of his team"". Met Police commissioner Cressida Dick praised the ""utterly heroic"" actions of the officer, who is in a stable condition in hospital. She said: ""It's hard to pick out individual stories but I am immensely proud of him and what he did."" The BTP officer, who has not been named, was seriously injured but is now in a stable condition. Chief Constable Paul Crowther from the BTP said the bravery he showed was ""outstanding"". The officer, who was stabbed in the attack, has said he has been ""truly moved and overwhelmed by all the support"". He added: ""I'm so sorry I couldn't do more and I want you to know I did everything I could."" This video can not be played Florin tried to fight off an attacker at Borough Market Romanian baker Florin Morariu saw a commotion outside Borough Market's Bread Ahead bakery, where he works, and invited some distressed Brazilian women inside and gave them a glass of water. When they told him that three men were stabbing people in the market, he headed outside with two crates to tackle the attackers. Speaking to the Victoria Derbyshire show, he said: ""I felt pity for the victims, I didn't know how to handle things or react, I thought to myself I'm also in danger. ""I just threw the crate at [one of the attackers]. ""I threw the first crate and I knew he was going to dodge it. While he was dodging it, I walked towards him and hit him in the head with the other crate."" He said a policeman then shouted at him to stand back, before discharging a stun grenade. Roy Larner was stabbed five times while attempting to shield people from the attackers. Friends have raised more than Â£10,000 for Mr Larner, who say he is now in intensive care, to go towards his recovery. Jayne Jacob, who set up a JustGiving page on Sunday, said: ""Roy got caught up in the terror attack at London Bridge and was badly injured whilst protecting lives. ""A Millwall supporter and in my mind a proper hero and deserves our support and aid to help him on his recovery."" According to friend Mick Church, Roy was left with stab wounds on his face, neck and suffered a collapsed lung. Carlos (left) and Giovanni were in a restaurant where an attacker stabbed a woman Giovanni Sagristani, 38, and his friends were in the El Pastor restaurant on Stoney Street when one of the attackers came in and stabbed a woman in the chest. ""He came in shouting and just stabbed her,"" he said. Mr Sagristani's partner Carlos Pinto, 33, who works as a critical care nurse in London, looked after the woman, with the help of his friend, another nurse. ""They took some ice and cloths and tried to stop the bleeding. She lost half a litre of blood in the beginning. He was keeping pressure on the wound,"" Mr Sagristani said. He said fellow diners had managed to push the attacker out of the restaurant by throwing chairs and bottles at him. Once the attacker was outside, staff lowered a security gate and locked people inside. Diners threw chairs and bottles at the attacker ""After the initial moment of panic, everyone tried to help this girl and stay calm. We were all at the back of the restaurant. There were shots going off outside and we didn't know what was going on."" Mr Sagristani said it was more than two hours before the paramedics were able to reach them. ""They kept her conscious. It was very lucky they were there,"" he added.

"Fifty years ago, war broke out between Israel and its neighbours. The conflict lasted just six days but its effect would last to the present day. At the end of 1948, Israel's Arab neighbours had invaded to try to destroy the new state, and failed. The Egyptian army had been beaten, but a force surrounded in a piece of land known as the Falluja pocket refused to surrender. A group of young Egyptian and Israeli officers tried to break the impasse. Among them was Yitzhak Rabin, a 26-year-old Israeli military prodigy who was head of operations on the southern front, and the 30-year-old Egyptian Major Gamal Abdel Nasser. Just a few years after the Nazis had killed six million Jews, the dream of establishing a state in their biblical homeland had come true. Palestinians call 1948 ""al-Nakba"", or ""the Catastrophe"". Up to 750,000 Palestinians fled or were expelled from the land that became Israel, and were never allowed back. For the Arabs, defeat at the hands of the fledgling Israeli state was a seismic political moment that led to years of upheaval. Nasser became a hero in the Arab world in the wake of the Suez crisis Feeling betrayed, humiliated army officers seized power. Syria had regular military coups. Four years after the end of the war, Nasser led a group of young officers who overthrew the king of Egypt. By 1956, Nasser was president. In the same year, he defied Britain, France and Israel in the Suez crisis, and became the hero and leader of the Arab world. In Israel, Rabin continued his military career. By 1967, he was chief-of-staff, the most senior officer. Arabs could not get over the pain of defeat; the Israelis never forgot that their neighbours tried to destroy them. Both sides knew that another war would come, sooner or later. Israel and its Arab neighbours had plenty of reasons for hatred or mutual suspicion. But the Cold War in the 1950s and 1960s added extra fuel. The Soviet Union provided Egypt with a modern air force. Israel had warm relations with the United States, but it was not yet the biggest recipient of American military aid; in the 1960s Israel also bought aircraft from France and tanks from Britain. What the war meant to Israelis and Arabs The friendship that grew out of war What makes Jerusalem so holy Why aren't the Israelis and Palestinians talking? After 1948 Israel had worked endlessly to make the best of its exposed strategic position. It also absorbed more than one million immigrants - military service was an important part of making the new arrivals into Israelis. Israel built a speedy, flexible and deadly military. And by 1967 it was close to acquiring its own nuclear weapons. Yitzhak Rabin (left) was Israel's chief of staff by 1967 The new, native-born Israelis, known as ""sabras"" - the Hebrew word for prickly pear - were determined not to repeat what they believed had been the mistakes of Jews in the diaspora. They would always fight back, and sometimes fight first. Rabin was confident that Israel's armed forces were in good shape. Their mission was to win every war, on the grounds that Israel could not afford a single defeat. Egyptian forces and those of its ally Syria, trained less, boasted more and forgot that the political victory that emerged after the 1956 Suez crisis was preceded by a military defeat. Nasser concentrated on building a pan-Arab nationalist movement that his supporters fully expected would recreate Arab greatness, and exact revenge on Israel. He made his closest ally, Field Marshal Abdul Hakim Amer, commander-in-chief of the armed forces. Abdul Hakim Amir was the commander of Egypt's armed forces Egypt was an ancient country without the sense of insecurity that underlay Israel's swagger.  Amer's most important mission, which he did very well, was to make sure that the army stayed loyal by stamping out plots and keeping the officer corps happy. The military arts were much less of a priority. By 1967, Egypt was bogged down in a war in Yemen that had become its own Vietnam. It had not fought well. But Nasser could not replace Amer with a better soldier. The Syrian army was equally politicised, and like Egypt was a client of the Soviet Union. A series of generals were rotated into power by a series of coups d'Ã©tat. Arabs talked a lot about unity, socialism and nationalism, but in reality they were deeply disunited. The Syrian and Egyptian leaderships fretted about plots allegedly instigated by the monarchies in Jordan and Saudi Arabia. Kings worried that the military populists who led Syria and Egypt would incite revolution. Jordan's ruler, King Hussein, was a close ally of Britain and the US. Jordan was the only Arab state that emerged from 1948 as a winner. King Hussein of Jordan Hussein's grandfather, King Abdullah, had secret contacts with the Jewish Agency, the main body representing Jews in British Mandate Palestine; they discussed carving up the land between them in the wake of Britain's planned departure in 1948. In 1951 a Palestinian nationalist assassinated Abdullah at the al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem. Fifteen-year-old Prince Hussein saw his grandfather die, and the next day carried a gun for the first time. A year later he was king. After the 1948 war, Jordan and Israel came close, but not close enough, to making peace. Secret talks continued into Hussein's reign.  He was aware of Jordan's weaknesses - it was mainly desert and had a large and restive population of Palestinian refugees. War in 1967 came as a result of years of increasing tension and vicious border skirmishes between Arabs and Israelis. The border between Egypt and Israel was relatively quiet. The biggest flashpoint was Israel's northern border with Syria, where they fought over disputed territory and Syria's attempts to divert the River Jordan away from Israel's national water grid. The Syrians sheltered Palestinian guerrillas, who were mounting raids into Israel. Western powers had no doubt which side in the Middle East was stronger on the eve of war in 1967. The US military's Joint Chiefs of Staff judged ""that Israel will be militarily unchallengeable by any combination of Arab states at least during the next five years."" In a report on the Israeli army in January 1967, the British defence attachÃ© in Tel Aviv assessed that ""in command, training, equipment and services the Israel army is more prepared for war than ever before. Well-trained, tough, self-reliant, the Israeli soldier has a strong fighting spirit and would willingly go to war in defence of his country."" The border wars stoked the tension. Palestinian guerrillas broke through the border fence. Israel condemned them as terrorists; it believed that to deter and punish, it had to hit back hard. Jerusalem, 1965 A big Israeli raid into the Jordanian-occupied West Bank targeting the village of Samua in November 1966, followed a land mine attack inside Israel. The raid caused uproar among Palestinians in the West Bank. Hussein was aghast. He told the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) that for three years he had been in secret talks with Israel; his Israeli contacts had sent him assurances there would be no reprisals on the morning of the raid. The Americans were sympathetic. They supported a resolution at the UN Security Council condemning the Samua raid. Hussein imposed martial law on the West Bank and became more convinced than ever that his throne was in jeopardy, and that he could be overthrown by angry Palestinians. He feared a coup by radical pro-Nasser officers in the army that Israel could use as a pretext to swallow the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The king did not want to share the fate of the other Hashemite monarch in the Middle East, his cousin and friend King Faisal of Iraq. He had been shot in the yard of his palace in a military coup in 1958. The march to war continued with escalating trouble on the Israel-Syrian border. Unlike Hussein, who the Americans believed was doing all he could to stop Palestinian infiltration, Syria actively encouraged it; Israel was pushing its claims to disputed territory in the border area aggressively by cultivating fields in demilitarised areas with armoured tractors. It came to a head with a full-scale air and artillery battle between Israel and Syria on 7 April, 1967.  Israel routed the Syrians. The next morning young Palestinians in Jerusalem, according to British diplomats, showed ""a stunned awe at the Israeli competence and Arab helplessness in the face of it"" and they asked ""where were the Egyptians?"" Pressure was growing on Nasser to add action to his talk. Israel basked in a mood of national self-congratulation. But some elder statesmen and soldiers were alarmed. In a corridor in the Israeli parliament (the Knesset), the military's former chief-of-staff Moshe Dayan bumped into General Ezer Weizmann, the former head of the air force and now Rabin's number two. ""Are you out of your minds?"" Dayan said. ""You're leading the country to war!"" Moshe Dayan pushed for a quick attack Syria, and the Palestinian guerrillas it sponsored, tried even harder to provoke the Israelis, who obliged them by rising to every provocation. It looked to Syria and Egypt, as well as to Britain and the US, that Israel was planning a bigger move. An exaggerated news agency report, quoting ""a high Israeli source"" said that Israel ""would take limited military action designed to topple the Damascus army regime if Syrian terrorists continued sabotage raids inside Israel"". The source was Brigadier General Aharon Yariv, the head of military intelligence. He mentioned toppling the regime only as the most extreme of a range of possibilities. But the report was taken seriously in Syria - and also in the Israeli press. Then an intervention by the Soviet Union changed everything. On 13 May, Moscow delivered a warning to Cairo that Israel was massing troops on the border with Syria and would attack within a week. Why exactly the Soviet Union fired the starting pistol for war has been debated ever since. Two Israeli historians, Isabella Ginor and Gideon Remez, argue that the USSR deliberately instigated the crisis; they say it wanted to block Israel's nuclear weapons plans; and that the Soviets were ready to commit their own forces to the fight. At the time a ""medium-level"" Soviet official told the CIA that the Soviet Union was stirring up the Arabs to try to make trouble for the US. With the big problems in Vietnam, another war in the Middle East would be an even worse headache. In 1967 neither Israel nor its Arab neighbours needed much encouragement. They plunged straight into the crisis that they had all expected for years. Twenty-four hours after the Soviet warning, Egypt's supreme commander, Field Marshal Amer, put the army on full alert for war. Lieutenant General Anwar al-Qadi, the chief of operations, told Amer that more than half of the army, including some of its best troops, was bogged down in Yemen; it was in no condition to fight Israel. Amer reassured him that fighting was not part of the plan; it was just a ""demonstration"" in response to Israel's threats to Syria. Two days later Egypt dug itself deeper into crisis. It expelled UN peacekeepers that had patrolled the border with Israel since 1956, and moved troops into the Sinai desert. UN peacekeepers in Sinai and Gaza were expelled by Egypt The Israeli army, still obsessed with Syria, was much more patient with Egypt at first. Shlomo Gazit, who was head of analysis in military intelligence, told American diplomats that Israel had been taken by surprise by Egypt's belligerency, but it was ""an elaborate charade"", that would only get serious if Egypt blockaded the port of Eilat on the Red Sea by closing the Straits of Tiran. The mood was whipped up by Nasser's ubiquitous radio station, Sawt al-Arab, the Voice of the Arabs. Broadcasting from Cairo to the rest of the Middle East, it was a vital tool of Nasser's foreign policy. Throughout the crisis, its chief announcer, Ahmed Said, read out a series of blood-curdling threats to Israel. The Israelis did not call Nasser's bluff when he threw out the UN peacekeepers and sent more troops into the Sinai. So he doubled the stakes. On 22 May, he banned Israeli shipping from the Straits of Tiran, the entrance to the Gulf of Aqaba, effectively re-imposing the blockade of the port of Eilat that had been lifted in 1956. At an airbase in the Sinai desert Nasser announced: ""If Israel wishes to threaten war, we tell her, you are welcome."" A photo shows Nasser, looking as debonair as ever, surrounded by happy young flyers. Smiles flashed across the grainy black and white still. The image Nasser desired was pumped around the world - the leader of the Arabs challenging the Jewish state, surrounded by the symbols of a modern fighting force - jet pilots - ready for action. Nasser looks excited, almost like a child intoxicated by the enormity of the line he had just crossed. Nasser pictured with Egyptian jet pilots at Bir Gifgafa air base in Sinai, 22 May 1967 The Americans responded 42 minutes after the announcement from Cairo, dangling the prospect of a visit by the US Vice-President Hubert Humphrey if the crisis was averted. President Lyndon Johnson was angry. The UN Secretary General U Thant was in the air, flying to Cairo on a peace mission when Nasser made his new threat. Nasser repeated the promise he had already made to the Americans and the Soviets, that Egypt would not fire the first shot. But U Thant concluded gloomily that unless a way could be found around the blockade of Eilat, war was certain. The day after Nasser closed the Straits, the Israeli prime minister, Levi Eshkol, and the cabinet ordered a full mobilisation. In 48 hours, 250,000 men could be put into the field. After compulsory military service, all Israeli men were allocated to a reserve unit. In a couple of days, most Israeli men under the age of 50 were in some sort of military uniform. The pressure was crushing General Rabin. Against all the military evidence, he had convinced himself that he was leading Israel to catastrophe. Rabin smoked pack after pack of cigarettes and eventually suffered a nervous collapse. He slept for nearly 24 hours, recovered himself, and went back to work. International diplomacy attempted to settle the crisis before it descended into full-scale war. Israel's foreign minister, Abba Eban, flew to Washington for an urgent meeting with President Johnson. In 1956, when Israel attacked Egypt as part of a secret agreement with Britain and France, the Americans branded Israel an aggressor, and forced it to pull out of the land it conquered. This time Eban wanted Johnson's consent for Israel's fight. The US president warned Israel not to fire the first shot. He told Eban not to worry about an Egyptian attack. It wasn't imminent and if it came ""you'll whip the hell out of them"". US President Lyndon B Johnson warned the Israelis not to fire the first shot Johnson indicated he would work on ways of getting the Straits of Tiran open, perhaps with a multinational naval task force, but wanted time to see if it could work. Abba Eban decided Israel would have to move at America's pace, but the army was ready to attack and the generals were getting frustrated. Eban irritated the military men. His overblown style and metropolitan ways got under their skin. The generals were furious when the cabinet agreed on 28 May to wait two weeks. For them it was about much more than the Straits of Tiran. What mattered was the big picture. Nasser was uniting the entire Arab world against them. He had moved divisions into the Sinai desert, making a direct threat to Israel's borders. Nasser had been the undisputed leader of the Arab world since 1956. Now standing up to the hated Israelis, his position among Arabs as a political idol was reinforced. He held a news conference with foreign journalists in Cairo on 28 May, in which he linked the crisis in the Sinai and the Straits of Tiran with Israel's ""aggression"" towards the Palestinians. Coexistence was not possible because Israel, he said, had robbed and expelled the Palestinians in 1948. Israel would also get what was coming for threatening ""to march on Damascus, occupy Syria and overthrow the Syrian Arab regime"". Nasser's confidence forced King Hussein of Jordan into a corner. Hussein did not trust Nasser. He confided in the CIA station chief in Amman, Jack O'Connel, who had become a close confidant, that he was convinced the West Bank was Israel's strategic target. Hussein's senior officers were pressing for closer co-ordination with Nasser. 30 May 1967: Hussein and Nasser smile after signing a Jordan-Egypt defence agreement For Hussein it all came down to survival. He decided on reconciliation with Nasser. He believed that if he stayed out of the war ""an eruption"" among his Palestinian subjects might cause his regime to collapse. If he fought, Egyptian air cover might delay Israel's advance into the West Bank long enough for the UN to impose a ceasefire. On 30 May, King Hussein flew to Cairo and did the deal. When he returned to Amman deliriously happy crowds tried to lift up his Mercedes so they could carry it back to the palace. Hussein was not deluded. The crowds loved him because Nasser had accepted him, not the other way around. Later he told the historian Avi Shlaim: ""I knew that war was inevitable. I knew that we were going to lose. I knew that we in Jordan were threatened, threatened by two things: we either followed the course we did, or alternatively the country could tear itself apart if we stayed out."" If they could fight on their own terms, Israel's generals were confident they would score an overwhelming victory. But strict military censorship kept those conclusions private. At the same time, bloody threats poured out of Arab radio stations and on to the pages of Israeli newspapers. Only 22 years after the end of the Holocaust it was not surprising that the Arab propaganda hit home. A doom-laden mood overcame the country. People made black jokes: ""Let's meet after the war. Where? In a phone box,"" alluding to how many Israelis might be left. Civil defence preparations in Tel Aviv, June 1967 The government stockpiled coffins; rabbis consecrated parks as emergency cemeteries; tens of thousands of pints of blood were donated. The mood was not helped when Prime Minister Levi Eshkol made a disastrous broadcast to the nation on 28 May. He stammered and fluffed his way through it. At a meeting afterwards Israel's generals gave him a vicious dressing-down. Among many interventions, Brig Gen Ariel Sharon raged ""we have removed our principal weapon, fear of us"". Several of the commanders used aggressive, highly pejorative language comparing the government to Jewish leaders in the diaspora who had been forced to beg like slaves. Native-born Israelis in the 1950s and 60s were brought up to reject what they assumed was the weakness and passivity of European Jews who did not fight when the Nazis came. To the young Israeli generals, mainly native-born, mostly in their 30s and 40s, Eshkol, who liked speaking Russian and Yiddish as much as Hebrew, seemed to embody the weakness of the diaspora. That was unfair - he had arrived in Palestine as a young man and had spent his life building the state. Israeli Prime Minister Levi Eshkol was mistrusted by younger Israeli generals Brig Gen Elad Peled, one of four divisional commanders, was at the meeting. Peled told me in 2002: ""The mental generation gap was very important. We were the cowboys, frontier people. We looked at the older generation as people who were not free, they were not liberatedâ¦ the minister of education asked me 'what if you're wrong? You're playing with the existence of the state.' I told him I am 100% confident about the result of the war."" Like many Israeli prime ministers, Eshkol was also minister of defence. He was forced to give the job up, in favour of one of Israel's war heroes, the swashbuckling, one-eyed general, Moshe Dayan. The soldier had stated his essential philosophy at the funeral of Ray Rothberg, who was killed at a kibbutz near Gaza in 1956. ""It is the fate of our generation that our life requires that we be always prepared and armed, strong and determined, for if the sword be struck from our grasp, we shall die."" Nasser was gambling for high stakes. Egypt had a modern air force but the army was weak. His generals were well-aware that Nasser's brinkmanship had taken them to the edge of a disastrous war. International attempts to defuse the crisis had failed. The only idea the Americans and the British had was the so-called Red Sea Regatta, the proposed naval task force that would force open the Straits of Tiran. But the US and British admirals and politicians hated the idea. They worried it might not work, and that they would be handing Nasser another victory. On Friday 2 June, Israel's generals put the definitive case for war to the cabinet defence committee. They told the politicians that they could beat Egypt, but the longer they had to wait the harder it would be. A few days earlier Meir Amit, the head of Israel's spy agency Mossad, had travelled to Washington DC on a false passport, in disguise. He did not want to wait longer for war; he was deeply concerned about the shutdown in the economy caused by the mobilisation of most of the male population under the age of 50. Amit told me in 2002 about a crucial meeting he had with the US defence secretary, Robert McNamara. ""I saidâ¦ 'I'm going to recommend a war'. ""McNamara asked only two questions. 'How long?' I said it would take a week. 'How many casualties?' I said less than the war of independence, which was 6,000. McNamara said 'I read you loud and clear'."" The Americans had given a clear signal. They had been told that Israel would be going to war and had made no attempt to stop it happening. Amit travelled back to Israel with the Washington ambassador, Abe Harman, on an aircraft full of gas masks. They arrived in Tel Aviv on the evening of Saturday 3 June. A car took them straight to Eshkol's apartment, where he was waiting with his key ministers. Amit wanted an immediate war. Harman wanted to wait another week or so. Dayan disagreed: ""If we wait for seven to nine days, there will be thousands dead. It's not logical to wait. Let's strike first and then look after the political side."" Everyone who was there had no doubt that the decision had been taken. Israel was going to war. The cabinet ratified it the next morning. In Egypt, Nasser predicted Israel would attack on 4 or 5 June. He based his observation on the progress of an Iraqi armoured division, which was heading towards the Jordan Valley and Israel. He knew Israel would not tolerate such a change in the balance of forces. By 07:40 on 5 June, Ezer Weizman could hardly stand the suspense in the Air Force command centre in the ministry of defence in Tel Aviv. The Israeli war plan depended on a surprise attack, called Operation Focus, which would destroy the Arab air forces on the ground, starting with Egypt. They had trained for it for years and the first wave of attacks was about to go in. This video can not be played Six Day War: What happened - in 60 seconds Unlike the Egyptians and the other Arab armies, the Israelis had done their homework. They had flown hundreds of reconnaissance missions over the years to build up an accurate picture of every airbase in Egypt, Jordan and Syria.  Pilots had a target book, giving the details of their layouts, call signs and defences. From radio intercepts they even built up voice-recognition files of the main Arab commanders. It was a huge success. Field Marshal Amer and the Egyptian top brass were meeting at Bir Tamada, an airbase in Sinai. They were just starting the meeting when the first Israeli jets started their bomb runs. One of the generals was so surprised by the attack that the first thing that flashed through his mind was a coup or some other kind of Egyptian betrayal. Amer's plane was able to take off but at one point had nowhere to land as every Egyptian airbase was under attack. In Tel Aviv, Ezer Weizman was ecstatic. The attacks were going better than expected. They had achieved complete surprise over the enemy. He phoned his wife: ""We've won the war,"" he shouted. Later in the day Israel destroyed most of the Jordanian and Syrian air forces. Israel controlled the skies, and after that it was matter of finishing the job. Egypt's air force was decimated by Israel's pre-emptive strike Israel warned King Hussein not to enter the war. But his mind was already made up, and he had put Jordan's efficient army under the command of a less than capable Egyptian general. Just before midday fighting started in Jerusalem. The Jordanians opened fire. King Hussein ignored Israeli signals that Jordan would be spared if it stayed out of the war. After the Samua raid in 1966 he didn't believe Israeli assurances; and he was convinced that if he reneged on the military alliance he had entered with Egypt he would lose his throne. Further south, Israeli ground forces had pushed into the Sinai desert, and were moving forward rapidly in three broad thrusts. The Egyptians fought bravely from fixed positions but unlike the Israelis had not been trained to improvise, or to be flexible or speedy. In the army headquarters in Cairo the commanders were increasingly gripped by panic. General Salahdeen Hadidi slumped in his chair, convinced that the war was at least half lost. It was worse than that for Egypt. But outside on the streets the people were celebrating. Crowds poured into the city by evening on buses provided by the ruling party. Voice of the Arabs was their trusted source of news and truth, and it was pushing out fantasy. By 20:17 it was reporting that 86 Israeli aircraft had been destroyed and that Egyptian tanks had broken into Israel. At the headquarters of the Sinai front, General Mohamed Abdel Ghani Gamasy listened ""with growing horror"" to what he knew was a pack of nonsense. Years later I asked Ahmed Said why he had told outright lies on air. In his crumbling, once-grand apartment overlooking the Nile, he defended himself. 5 June: Egyptian warplanes destroyed on the tarmac ""You're asking people to fight, not danceâ¦ we believed the broadcasts were our most powerful weaponâ¦ many of our listeners were illiterate, so radio was the most important way to reach them."" Back in 1967, as real news of the defeats came through, Nasser and Amer had retreated to their villas. Anwar Sadat, who later as president made a historic peace deal with Israel and was assassinated by his own guards as a result, went for a long walk through the streets of Cairo. ""Dazed and broken-hearted"" he watched Nasser loyalists marching up and down the main avenue leading to the pyramids, chanting and dancing to fake reports of an imaginary victory. In the five days that followed Israel routed the armies of Egypt, Jordan and Syria. It captured the Gaza Strip and the Sinai desert from Egypt; the Golan Heights from Syria; and the West Bank and East Jerusalem, from Jordan. For the first time in almost two millennia the Jewish holy places in Jerusalem were under the control of Jews. More Palestinians were expelled, fled or were killed, though not on the scale of 1948. 7 June: Israeli soldiers approach the Dome of the Rock in East Jerusalem Nasser resigned, but changed his mind after millions went out into the streets to mourn and protest. He stayed in the job until his death in 1970. Field Marshal Amir died in mysterious circumstances. His family was convinced he was poisoned. King Hussein of Jordan lost East Jerusalem but kept his throne. He continued his secret dialogue with Israel and made peace in 1994. In Syria, the air force commander who had been in the ruling junta seized sole power in 1970. His name was Hafez al-Assad. His son, Bashar, succeeded him as president on his death in 2000. In Israel, Prime Minister Eshkol died of a heart attack in 1969. His widow, Miriam, believed that he had never recovered from being forced out of the ministry of defence on the eve of war. Eshkol's successor, Golda Meir, was warned in 1973 that Egypt and Syria were preparing a surprise attack. But the Israelis were still suffering from hubris after the crushing defeat they had inflicted in 1967. In the war that followed Israel was saved by a massive airlift of supplies from the United States. Egypt believed it had redeemed its national honour, and its president, Anwar Sadat, followed through with his historic overture for peace. After 1967 the Americans looked at Israel with new eyes. It fell in love with the young sabras who had beaten three Arab armies. The 1967 war changed many people's perception of Israel and its armed forces Like most Westerners in 1967, President Johnson's envoy Harry McPherson was deeply impressed. ""Israel at war destroys the prototype of the pale, scrawny Jew; the soldiers I saw were tough, muscular and sunburned. There is also an extraordinary combination of discipline and democracy among officers and enlisted men; the latter rarely salute and frequently argue, but there is no doubt about who will prevail."" Israel and the Palestinians felt the biggest consequences of the 1967 war. Israel began an occupation of the Palestinian territories that continues half a century later. It annexed East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in moves not recognised internationally. A 25-year-old Israeli soldier back from the war told his comrades: ""We've lost something terribly precious. We've lost our little country."" Israeli occupation replaced Jordanian occupation in the West Bank All the issues that are now depressingly familiar to anyone who follows the news - violence, occupation, settlements, the future of Jerusalem - took their current form as a result of the war. The shape of the occupation emerged very quickly. Predictions of the dangers that lay ahead were ignored. Just after the war ended, David Ben Gurion, Israel's first prime minister, warned against the seductive charms of victory. In a speech at Beit Berl, the think tank of the Israeli Left, he said that staying in the territories would distort the Jewish state and might even destroy it. Israel must keep Jerusalem, but everything else must go back to the Arabs, with or without a peace deal. Abba Eban, the foreign minister, saw maps that showed Israel stretching from the Golan to Suez and along the entire length of the River Jordan not as a ""guarantee of peace but an invitation to early war"". Israeli tanks in action on the Golan Heights But the mood in Israel blew away any suggestion of caution as decisively as the Israeli army had dealt with the Arabs. In just under a week of war the Israeli public went from despair to the joy of deliverance. Religious Jews believed that the victory was a miracle that had been given to them by God. Secular Israelis felt the electricity of the moment. Hanan Porat, a paratrooper who went on to become a leader of the settlement movement, never forgot the sight of his secular comrades weeping at the Western Wall, a remnant from the time of the second Jewish Temple, in East Jerusalem, a few minutes after they captured it. ""I had a sense that here in Jerusalem the inner truth of the Jewish nation was revealed. It was a miracle because the truth of the Bible was combined with the truth of life. An electric current ran right through the people of Israel."" Israeli paratroopers at the newly captured Western Wall - the image became iconic for Jews around the world The teaching of Rabbi Zvi Yehuda Kook inspired many of the settlers, including Porat. A leader of religious Zionism, Kook taught that the Israeli armed forces had done God's work. ""The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] is total sanctity. It represents the rule of the people of the Lord over His land."" It followed that land gifted to the Jewish people by a miracle from God could not be given up. The difficulty they faced was that Palestinians believed it was their land, and their duty to protect the holy places they venerated. President Johnson's Middle East adviser Bob Anderson warned a month after the war that Jerusalem had a special significance for Arabs. ""The Old City of Jerusalem is capable of stirring mobs in the streets to the point where the fate of our most moderate friends in the Middle East will be in jeopardy and the basis laid for a later holy war."" Some Israelis thought they might be able to trade some of the captured territory for peace, though not East Jerusalem which was enlarged with the addition of a band of territory from the West Bank and then annexed. At a summit in Khartoum at the end of August, Arab states were in no mood to go cap in the hand to the country that had humiliated them, again. Arab leaders said there would be no negotiations, no recognition and no peace with Israel. Paradoxically, defeat in 1967 helped kick start the Palestinian national movement. Before then the Palestine Liberation Organisation had been a puppet of Nasser, a way of containing the Palestinians rather than helping their fight for independence. After 1967 Yasser Arafat and his Fatah faction took matters into their own hands. After several dozen Fatah hit and run raids in only three months in 1968, the Israelis mounted a reprisal raid on the group's headquarters in Karameh refugee camp in Jordan. Members of Fatah on parade in the Jordanian capital, Amman, in August 1970 They ran into unexpected opposition from Palestinian guerrillas and Jordanian artillery. The Israelis destroyed Karameh in the end, but only after hours of street fighting that cost them at least 30 dead. Over 100 Fatah fighters were killed, and were celebrated as national heroes.  Arafat became chairman of the moribund PLO, and an international figure, the symbol of national liberation for Palestinians, the world's worst terrorist for Israelis. Yitzhak Rabinserved two terms as Israeli prime minister, firstly in the mid-1970s, and later between 1992-1995; in his second term of office he negotiated and signed historic Oslo peace accords with the Palestinians, for which he shared a Nobel Peace prize; he was assassinated by an ultra-nationalist Israeli Jew in Tel Aviv in 1995 King Hussein of Jordanordered the expulsion of PLO forces from Jordan in 1970 and rejected calls by Egypt and Syria to join their war against Israel in 1973. After years of secret talks, Jordan signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994. Hussein died in 1999 Hafez al-Assadtook power in a 1970 coup and was elected Syrian president in a referendum a year later; he ruled the country until he died in 2000. Relations with Israel remained hostile - there was an unsuccessful attempt to take back the Golan Heights in the 1973 Middle East war, and Assad continued to refuse any peace deal which did not include the return of Syrian territory Gamal Abdel Nasserdied of a heart attack in 1970; his successor, Anwar Sadat, eventually sought peace with Israel, signing an historic treaty in 1979; he wasassassinated by an Egyptian officer in 1981. The 1967 war made Israel into an occupier, which is why more than anything else it matters. The experience has been a disaster for Israelis and Palestinians. Israel built settlements for Jews, in defiance of international law that says occupiers cannot settle their people on the land they capture. Israel, though, sees it differently. Abba Eban predicted that Palestinians would not lose their ""taste for flags, honour, pride and independence."" Military occupation is by definition oppressive. The occupation has created a culture of violence that cheapens life and brutalises the people who impose and enforce the occupation and those who fight it. The ramifications of the war are still felt, 50 years on Peace negotiations started in the early 1990s to try to unwind the consequences of the 1967 war. Yitzhak Rabin, by then prime minister, shook hands with his old enemy Yasser Arafat under the gaze of a beaming President Clinton on the lawn of the White House in 1993. The peace process was flawed from the start for both sides. But it was all they had.  Extreme Israeli right-wingers took it seriously; they believed it threatened their dream of controlling all the land that God had given to the Jewish people. A Jewish extremist assassinated Rabin in Tel Aviv in 1995. His killer was so pleased that he had killed a man he saw as a traitor and a threat to Jews that during his first interrogation he picked up a cup to toast his success. Rabin was the necessary man for Israelis; they trusted him with their security. That was why he was killed. The peace process might have failed with Rabin. But without the man who had prepared and led the army to victory in 1967, and with Palestinian violence against Israelis rising in the unstable years after the assassination, peace did not have a chance. Fifty years on from 1967, President Trump - like many new American presidents - is hoping to help Israelis and Palestinians make peace. If his dreams become substantive talks, they will have to be about the future of the land that was captured in six days of war. It was an extraordinary human drama, which swept up a generation of Israelis and Arabs whose children and grandchildren still cannot live peacefully in the world the war created. The Holy Land, with Jerusalem at its heart, is a place where the great tectonic plates of religion, culture and nationalism come together. The fault lines that run between them are never quiet and always dangerous. Ignoring the legacy of 1967 is not an option. Â© 2025 BBC.
