"Passengers have been advised not to travel on trains unless necessary during strikes next week, with only a fifth of services due to run. Network Rail said about half of all rail lines will be closed when thousands of workers walk out across Britain on 21, 23 and 25 June. The services that run will start and finish earlier, from 07:30 to 18:30. There will be no trains at all in many places including north from Glasgow or Edinburgh and to Penzance in Cornwall. ""Make no mistake, the level of service we will be able to offer will be significantly compromised and passengers need to take that into account and to plan ahead and only travel if it's really necessary to do so,"" Network Rail boss Andrew Haines said. Network Rail, which owns and maintains the country's railways, said there would also be no passenger services to locations including Bournemouth in Dorset, Swansea in south Wales, Holyhead in north Wales, Chester in Cheshire and Blackpool in Lancashire. Open lines include the West Coast Main Line from London to Scotland via locations such as Birmingham and Manchester. However, with trains running for shorter hours on strike days, final departures will be much earlier than usual. For example, the last train from Manchester to London will leave at 14:47 and the last from Norwich to London at 16:00, with the last train from London to Edinburgh at 14:00. Rural and district lines will be most affected by the action. When is the rail strike and which lines will be affected? Are UK travellers heading for a summer of misery? The timetable from 20 June to 26 June is still being finalised, but the number of services is expected to be around 4,500 compared with 20,000 normally, Network Rail said. Disruption is also expected to carry over into non-strike days during the week, when only about 60% of services are expected to run. This is due to not enough staff being on shift overnight to get services ready for the following day. A number of train operators including Southeastern, TransPennine and Avanti West Coast have urged passengers to only travel by rail if necessary, while Northern has asked people ""not to travel"" on trains between Tuesday and Sunday. Several large events could be affected by the strikes, ranging from Glastonbury Festival, which runs from 22 to 26 June, to a cricket Test match between England and New Zealand taking place from 23 to 27 June. Pensioner Linda is supposed to be travelling by train from Great Yarmouth to London for a Rolling Stones concert on 25 June. She paid Â£100 per ticket but she is now unsure if there is any way for her to get there now. ""If I was to book a coach, it would cost a lot more - plus increase the travel time; two-and-a-half hours on the train becomes five to six hours on a coach,"" she told the BBC. ""And there's no way we'd get to the concert in time."" Elsewhere, Megan, a 15-year-old pupil at Bradford Grammar School, doesn't know how she will get to school. ""Both my parents work. My mum is a doctor so she's got to be in [work] really early,"" she said. ""I think we'll just have to organise lifts with someone."" ""It's just stressful. With traffic and everyone getting a lift in, it's going to be a nightmare,"" she added. Megan is worried how she'll get to school The school's bursar Homera Najib said about 300 pupils travel in by train from across Yorkshire and Leeds using the nearby Frizinghall station. She has contacted parents who have to make their own alternative arrangements to get their children to school, she said. ""We know this is going to be a real inconvenience for our pupils, especially at a time when we've got public examinations going on,"" she said. ""These are the first public examinations in two years so something like this that really throws a spanner in the works doesn't help the levels of stress."" More than 40,000 RMT union members from Network Rail and 13 train firms plan to walk out. The industrial action, which has been described as the ""biggest rail strike in modern history"", involves union members which include railway staff such as guards and signalling operators. RMT announced the strike action last week after talks over pay and redundancies fell through. On the first day of the planned strike on 21 June, London Underground RMT workers plan to walk out in a separate dispute over pensions and job losses. Andrew Haines, Network Rail chief executive, said talks with the union had ""not progressed as far as I had hoped"" and so preparations had begun for a strike. The strikes may be less disruptive for commuters, with more people now able to work from home since the pandemic. But the Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators, said ""millions of people"", including those who cannot work remotely, students sitting exams and others travelling for summer events, would still be affected. The mood music right now is that not enough progress has been made in negotiations to stop next week's walkouts. Assuming they go ahead, there will be disruption across the whole week. The involvement of Network Rail signalling staff means the number of trains that can run is particularly limited. On strike days, the signallers' replacements can only cover 12 hours, hence services will start late and finish early - where they run at all. Busy, key routes have been prioritised, meaning vast swathes of the country will be left with no services at all. Network Rail says next week's action will cost up to Â£150m in lost revenue and aborted work. The RMT union has claimed Network Rail plans to cut up to 2,500 jobs as part of a Â£2bn reduction in spending, with the proposed job cuts including workers who maintain tracks, signals and overhead lines. It also said train operators had been subject to pay freezes and changes to their terms and conditions. The RMT has called for a meeting with the transport secretary and chancellor, saying it had become clear that the Treasury was ""calling the shots and not allowing rail employers to reach a negotiated settlement"". But a deal is ""unlikely at the moment"", said RMT's Eddie Dempsey, who accused the government of ""relishing the thought of having a dispute to distract from some other issues"". A Department for Transport spokesperson said unions had ""gone on the record saying they don't negotiate with this government"", adding: ""They're right: they must negotiate with the employers."" The rail industry is under pressure to save money due to the financial impact of the coronavirus pandemic and Network Rail has said it wants to modernise working practices. It estimated between 1,500 and 2,000 fewer staff would be needed, but insists this could be achieved through voluntary means. As part of a separate strike, Aslef, a union representing train drivers, has announced walkouts at three companies in rows over pay on 26 June at Hull Trains, at Greater Anglia on 23 June, and on Croydon Tramlink on 28, 29 June and 13 and 14 July.

"Germany has accused Russian state-controlled gas giant Gazprom of attempting to push up energy prices by sharply reducing supplies. Gazprom said it was limiting the amount of gas to Germany to under 70m cubic metres per day - well under half the current rate. The reason it gave was to service equipment in the Nord Stream pipeline. But German economy minister Robert Habeck said it was ""a political decision"" and not a technical one. ""It is obviously a strategy to unsettle and drive up prices."" Gazprom said initially on Tuesday it was cutting the Nord Stream 1 gas flow from 167m cubic metres a day to 100m but then on Wednesday announced it would be cut further to 67m cubic metres. Gazprom also reduced its gas supply to Italy by around 15% on Wednesday, energy firm ENI said. Italy, like Germany, is heavily reliant on Russian gas, which accounts for 40% of its imports. The Russian company's move came two weeks after European Union leaders agreed toblock most Russian oil imports by the end of 2022to punish Moscow for invading Ukraine. Can the world cope without Russian oil and gas? Poland, Bulgaria, Finland, Denmark and the Netherlands have already had their Russian natural gas deliveries suspended after they refused ademand for ""unfriendly countries"" to pay in Russian roubles. Russia's payment demand was seen as an attempt to boost the rouble after it was hit by Western sanctions. Greater foreign exchange demand for roubles was likely to increase demand and push up the currency's value. Mr Habeck said Russia's actions showed European countries needed to end their dependency on fossil fuels urgently. In February, Germany suspended the opening of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, shortly before Russia launched its war in Ukraine. The minister said he would wait to see how the move affected the European and German gas markets but said suppliers had always managed to find gas from other sources. ""We don't have a supply problem in Germany either,"" he said. ""Gas will probably continue to be stored. We have made very good progress in this area in the last few days and weeks. ""However, we will certainly have to wait two or three days to get a complete overview of how things are developing now."" In another development on Wednesday, the EU signed a framework agreement with Israel and Egypt aimed at increasing the amount ofIsraeli natural gasexported to European countries.

"The head of the Federal Reserve is under pressure as price rises accelerate The US central bank has announced its biggest interest rate rise in nearly 30 years as it ramps up its fight to rein in soaring consumer prices. The Federal Reserve said it would increase its key interest rate by three quarters of a percentage point to a range of 1.5% to 1.75%. The rise, the third since March, comes after inflation in the US surged unexpectedly last month. More hikes are expected, adding to the uncertainty facing the economy. Forecasts released after the meeting showed officials expect the rate the Fed charges banks to borrow could reach 3.4% by the end of the year, the moves rippling out to the public in the form of higher borrowing costs for mortgages, credit cards and other loans. As central banks around the world take similar steps, it marks a massive change for the global economy, where businesses and households have enjoyed years of low borrowing costs. Eurozone plans first interest rate rise in 11 years How high could interest rates go? Why is inflation in the US so high? ""Most advanced economy central banks and some emerging market central banks are tightening policy in sync,"" said Gregory Daco, chief economist at strategy consulting firm EY-Parthenon. ""That is a global environment that we've not been accustomed to in the past few decades, and that will represent ramifications for the business sector and for consumers throughout the world."" In the UK, where consumer prices jumped 9% in April, the Bank of England is expected to announce its fifth rate rise since December on Thursday, pushing its benchmark rate above 1% for the first time since 2009. Brazil, Canada and Australia have also raised rates, while the European Central Bank has outlined plans to do so later this summer. The housing sector is feeling the impact of higher rates In the US, which slashed rates to support the economy when the pandemic hit in 2020, the Fed has already raised rates twice this year, by 0.25 percentage points in March and another half point in May. At the time, Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell said officials were not considering sharper rises. But figures on Friday, which showed US inflation rising to 8.6% in May - the fastest pace since 1981 - pushed officials to move more aggressively, Mr Powell said at a press conference following this week's meeting. ""It is essential that we bring inflation down,"" he said, acknowledging that a 0.75 percentage point rise was ""unusually large"". ""Inflation has obviously surprised to the upside over the past year and further surprises could be in store,"" he said. ""We therefore will need to be nimble."" Playing catch up Many analysts say the Fed is struggling to catch up, after Mr Powell and others last year dismissed price rises as a temporary problem related to supply chain issues. Since then, inflation has sharpened due to factors like the war in Ukraine and ongoing Covid-19 shutdowns in China. Recent surveys suggest the public expects the problem will continue to worsen, despite the Fed's vows to act. ""The Fed is under the gun and facing an inflation credibility test,"" said economist David Beckworth, senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. Ignacio Lopez isn't convinced the Fed's moves will successfully contain price increases affecting his business Ignacio Lopez is eager to see inflation brought under control. For the last 18 months, the Boston-based chef has been watching food prices climb as he stocks up for his restaurant. Prices for items with complicated supply chains, like packaged goods and imported cheese, are particularly under pressure, he says. ""It's crazy and it doesn't stop,"" he says. ""Every week things go up."" The business has raised its own prices to offset the costs, but he says he can't go too far without losing customers. So his profits are still taking a hit. He is worried that the rate increases won't help, noting that demand remains weak due to Covid, which has cut into the after-work gatherings that used to drive his business. ""We're just going to keep managing it as tight as we can, trying not to increase our prices beyond our market and hope things calm down,"" he says. The last time the Fed announced a rate hike of this size was 1994. The move, which makes borrowing more expensive, is expected to cool demand and slow economic activity - in theory, easing price pressures. But by acting late, and now moving more aggressively to compensate, policymakers face a greater chance that their actions will induce an economic downturn, Mr Daco said. ""I'm increasingly worried,"" he added. ""I wouldn't be surprised that around the turn of the year we face an environment where growth is stalling and we're pretty close to a recessionary environment, with the unemployment rate on the rise and no longer declining."" Higher food prices are one of the factors driving up inflation Mr Powell said the US is well poised to handle higher rates, pointing to still robust job growth. But projections released by the Fed show officials expect economic growth to slow to about 1.7% this year, a full percentage point lower than they forecast in March. Unemployment, now at 3.6%, is expected to rise to 3.7% and reach 4.1% by 2024. Officials also removed a line from their end of meeting statement - which typically shows little change - saying the labour market would remain strong as the Fed raised rates. Mr Powell said the omission reflected the fact that many forces driving inflation - like the war in Ukraine - are out of the bank's control. ""So much of it is really not down to monetary policy,"" he said. ""That just didn't seem appropriate anymore so we took it out."" With Wednesday's rise, the rate the Fed charges banks to borrow will return to where it was before the pandemic hit in 2020, remaining relatively low by historic standards. But the increases are already having an impact. The average petrol price in the US has hit $5 a gallon, creating a political problem for President Joe Biden Higher rates have helped to boost demand for dollars, sending the currency up 10% since the start of the year and putting other countries, especially emerging markets with large amounts of debt in dollars, under pressure. People in Pakistan urged to drink fewer cups of tea Weak pound puts the squeeze on holiday spending In the US, financial markets have slipped, with the S&P 500, which tracks hundreds of America's biggest companies, losing a fifth of its value since the start of the year, as multinationals warn that inflation and the rise in the dollar is hurting their profits. Home sales have also slowed precipitously as mortgage rates follow the Fed rate higher. Data on Wednesday also showed retail sales slipped last month, as people spent more at the pump due to rising petrol costs and deferred purchases of big ticket items like cars. Mr Powell said gaining control of the price increases was essential to economic stability and progress would take time. ""At the end of the day, the outlook is very uncertain,"" Mr Beckworth said. ""The Fed has to be at some level, lucky."" When will interest rates fall? Why is inflation in the US so high? Eurozone plans first interest rate rise in 11 years Weak pound puts the squeeze on holiday spending People in Pakistan urged to drink fewer cups of tea Energy and food drive US inflation to 40-year high Surprise fall in inflation boosts interest rate cut hopes Why a small drop in inflation matters to you Keir Starmer and Kemi Badenoch clash over UK economy at PMQs What happens if TikTok is banned?

"UK service personnel working at the IDCC, Patch Barracks, Stuttgart, Germany The BBC has been allowed rare access to the military nerve centre where Western powers are coordinating efforts to supply weapons and ammunition to Ukraine. In the attic of an austere US military barracks in the German city of Stuttgart, dozens of military personnel from 26 nations are working round the clock to deliver weapons to Ukraine. From this room, Western allies have already helped deliver nearly $8bn (Â£6.6bn) worth of weapons and ammunition to Ukraine's armed forces. That's 66,000 tonnes - the equivalent of 5,000 London double-decker buses, as one British officer worked out. Most of what happens at Patch Barracks is highly classified. We are asked to leave all electronic devices behind and we are not allowed to film or talk to the Ukrainians who are part of the International Donors Coordination Cell (IDCC). Military personnel from dozens of countries bash the phones and pore over computer screens. They include a small team from Ukraine, led by a three-star general. At the start of each day he sets out what his country needs. The situation in the Donbas appears increasingly bleak, but here in Stuttgart there's more a sense of urgency than panic. US M777 Howitzers have arrived in Ukraine Around one set of desks a team is tasked with locating supplies. Sometimes they'll find a nation willing to provide weapons, but will then have to track another country for the right ammunition or the means to transport them. They've now developed a database where the Ukrainians can list their priorities. Donor nations can access that information and decide what they're willing and able to supply. Brig Chris King, the senior British officer, says that military aid is being delivered by air, road, rail and sea and to multiple locations ""in order to ensure we don't have any single points of failure"". He says that Russia has tried to step up its attacks on supply lines but there's been no ""significant"" interruption to their delivery. I ask if any supplies have been hit. ""Yes, I presume so,"" he replies. The task of moving the weapons and ammunition across the border is left to the Ukrainians themselves, says Rear Adm Duke Heinz, the senior US commander at the IDCC. ""In Poland and the other countries, the Ukrainians come and get it - so they're the ones who determine how it gets across the border."" Once the weapons cross the border, they can arrive at the front line ""within 48 hours"". Recently there have been alarming warnings from Ukraine that the flow of weapons is too little and too late. As Russia continues to bombard the Donbas, pleas for more help are sounding more desperate by the day. Ukraine's deputy defence minister says that, so far, the country has only received 10% of what it has asked for. Here in Stuttgart, Rear Adm Heinz gives a very different message: ""I am confident they are not going to run out of ammunition."" Despite the grim news from the Donbas, he says ""I wouldn't say they're losing, I'd say they're holding their own."" Ukraine's demands have changed significantly over the past few months. The IDCC was set up in late February - bringing together two separate efforts being led by the US and the UK. At the start of the war they were sending small arms and ammunition - such as anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles. Now Ukrainians are asking for heavier weapons - artillery, multiple rocket launchers and air defence systems. What weapons has the US given Ukraine? In the early days of the war the IDCC tried to source stocks of old Soviet weapons and ammunition from former Soviet bloc countries - the same systems Ukraine's armed forces had been using for decades. Brig King says those supplies have slowly been running out. There is now just one factory in Europe that produces Soviet-compatible 152mm artillery ammunition. Slowly, they have been transitioning to Nato-standard equipment. Over the past few months Ukraine has been sent more than 100 M777 US howitzers and 300,000 rounds of 155mm ammunition. This brings an additional challenge, as Ukrainian forces need to be trained in how to use the weapons and ammunition. The IDCC is organising that training outside Ukraine. Some Ukrainian troops are now being trained in the UK on new artillery guns and British-supplied multiple rocket launchers. Simpler systems can be taught virtually, using videos and training manuals. Neither Rear Adm Heinz nor Brig King believe this war will be over quickly. They both say they're preparing to carry on this work for the long term. When I ask the brigadier for how long, he replies, ""It's not going to be months, I think we'll be here for a number of years."" But there are some within Nato who question whether the West is really geared up for a war that could go on for years. It could certainly test its unity, resolve and limited stocks of weapons and ammunition. In Stuttgart they know the stakes couldn't be higher. Rear Adm Heinz describes the mission of providing Ukraine with weapons and ammunition as ""the most important work this command has done"" since US EUCOM (European Command) was set up in 1952. Brig King calls it ""a generational moment"" and says the choice is stark: ""We either help Ukraine to fight or we accept that, maybe not straight away but in the next few years, we're going to be fighting somewhere else. If we don't do enough we will sow the seeds for future conflict.""

"Headingley - Yorkshire's home ground - will host next week's third Test between England and New Zealand Charges have been brought against ""a number of individuals"" by English cricket's governing body in relation to allegations of racism at Yorkshire. The accused, who have not been named, could be banned or fined by the England and Wales Cricket Board. Yorkshire itself has also been charged with breaching the anti-racism rules. Details of abuse first surfaced in September 2020 when former player Azeem Rafiq said discrimination left him feeling suicidal. ""In matters of this nature, our normal practice is not to identify individuals charged at this stage,"" said the ECB. Yorkshire said the ""allegations relate to charges as far back as 2004 up until 2021"". In a statement, the County added: ""The club will need the cooperation of those in position during this time in order to fully consider and respond to the matters raised."" Since Rafiq's accusations became public, 16 members of staff have left Yorkshire in a widespread overhaul of its senior leadership. The ECB said it had carried out a ""thorough and complex"" investigation to establish the grounds for the charges against both the county and the individuals involved. It said the charges arose from alleged breaches of a directive regarding ""conduct which is improper or which may be prejudicial to the interests of cricket or which may bring the ECB, the game of cricket or any cricketer into disrepute"" and its anti-discrimination code. The governing body expects hearings to take place in September or October and for the outcome of each case to be published after decisions are reached. ""It is standard practice for the cricket discipline commission disciplinary panel to publish its decisions and written reasons in full following the hearing,"" the ECB added. Rafiq played for Yorkshire across two spells totalling eight years ""I welcome today's announcement by the ECB and hope we can move to the hearing quickly,"" said Rafiq. ""This has been another gruelling but unfortunately necessary process. It has been a long two years since I went public about my experiences, but I hope this all means that no young player ever goes through such pain and alienation again. ""My preference would be for this hearing to take place publicly, but I am hopeful that we are at least nearing a point where there will be some sense of closure for my family and me."" BBC Sport understands Rafiq is himself likely to be charged at a later date over historical anti-Semitic posts on social media. Rafiqapologised and said he was ""deeply ashamed""for using the language in Facebook messages in 2011, which emerged after his appearance in front of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee. Rafiq gave an interview to ESPN Cricinfo in September 2020 alleging ""institutional racism"" at Yorkshire had left him close to taking his own life. Yorkshire launched ""a formal investigation"" in response and, a year later, an independent panel upheld seven of the 43 allegations made by Rafiq. However the panel's report was not published and no player, employee or executive faced disciplinary action as a result of its findings. The outcome sparked widespread criticism and in November 2021 the ECB suspended Yorkshire from hosting international matches at Headingley ""until it has clearly demonstrated that it can meet the standards expected"". Club chairman Roger Hutton stepped down, as did chief executive Mark Arthur. When approached by BBC Sport, the ECB declined to name any individuals charged. Former Yorkshire and England captain Michael Vaughan, who works as a pundit for BBC Sport and others,revealed he had been accused of making racist comments to Rafiq and others players,but has repeatedly denied the claims. Vaughan told the BBC he never made racist comments while at the county. He admitted regret at some tweets he had sent in the past. Later in November, Rafiq gave details of the racist abuse he suffered to a committee of MPs, claiming captain Gary Ballance and bowler Jack Brooks had used racist nicknames for team-mates. Ballance admitted using racist language,adding that he ""deeply regretted"" doing so. This video can not be played Nov 2021: Ex-England captain Michael Vaughan speaks to BBC Breakfast's Dan Walker Rafiq also mentioned the attitudes of Tim Bresnan, Andrew Gale and Matthew Hoggard towards him at the club. Bresnan has denied ""frequently making racist comments"",saying it is ""absolutely not true."" The ECB has not named those charged. Rafiq's testimony has been backed by others. Ex-Pakistan seamer Rana Naved-ul-Hasan saidhe had encountered the same prejudiceduring his two stints with the county while former Yorkshire academy playersIrfan AmjadandTabassum Bhattihave also shared their experiences of racism. England bowler Adil Rashid said he, like Rana Naved and Rafiq,had heard Vaughan make a racist comment. In December, head coach Gale and director of cricket Martyn Moxon wereamong 16 people to leave the club. Gale won a claim for unfair dismissal- alongside second-team coach Ian Dews, bowling coach Rich Pyrah, academy lead Richard Damms and strength and conditioning coaches Ian Fisher and Peter Sim. The ECB announceda wide-ranging review into racism in the sportandappointed a Muslim inclusion advisory body to help their reforms on Tuesday. Headingley returned to the international fixture list in March after members voted through reforms to the county's leadership structure. It will host the third and final Test against New Zealand next week.

"Delays unloading ambulances at busy hospitals are causing serious harm to patients, a safety watchdog is warning. TheHealthcare Safety Investigation Branch,externalhas been investigating how the long waits are delaying 999 emergency response times across England. Kenneth Shadbolt, 94, waited more than five hours for an ambulance after a bad fall - an accident that proved fatal. Logs show that in his final 999 call he asked: ""Can you please tell them to hurry up or I shall be dead."" The BBC has been given permission from the coroner to view detailed evidence into his recent death. Ken Shadbolt had been in good shape for his age. A retired factory worker and carpenter, he lived alone in a semi-detached house in the market town of Chipping Campden in the Cotswolds, and could often be spotted cycling around the local housing estate on his electric trike. On the night of Wednesday, 23 March 2022, he called one of his five sons for a chat before turning in for the night. Just before 03:00, he got out of bed to go the bathroom and fell, hitting a wardrobe before collapsing on the floor. He had hurt his hip - how badly he didn't know - and couldn't get up. He could reach his mobile on his bedside, though, and dialled 999 for help. The BBC has seen transcripts of the three separate phone calls he made to South Western Ambulance Service that night. The first was short and factual, covering the basic details of his injury. He seemed calm and lucid but made clear he was in pain and needed an ambulance. He was told by the call handler not to try to move unless he felt in danger and assured that help was ""being arranged"". ""How long will it be?"" he asked. ""I don't know, unfortunately, [but] we will try to get someone there as soon as we can,"" came the reply. He then spoke to one of his sons who offered to drive up that night from the other side of the country. Ken said he thought an ambulance was on the way, and not to worry. Internal call logs seen by the BBC show that at this point Ken was triaged as a category two emergency, meaning paramedics should arrive in 18 minutes, on average. That didn't happen. About 15 minutes later, he called 999 for a second time. It was clear by now that he was starting to worry. He said he couldn't move his right leg and talked about an injury to his shoulder as he'd hit the floor. He was worried about his mobile phone, saying the battery ""won't last forever"". ""When I rang up 999 I thought I would get some treatment straight away,"" he told the next person on the line. ""It is still down as an emergency response,"" the call handler replied. ""We are extremely busy at the moment but we are working on getting that help to you as quickly as we possibly can, ok?"" An internal ambulance service log seen by the BBC shows that South Western Ambulance Service was indeed busy that night. It talks about ""high demand"" in the Gloucester area, with more than 60 patients waiting for help, some for more than eight hours. But something else was going on at the same time. The local A&E was very full, so paramedics arriving outside the emergency department were unable to unload their sick patients straight away. The ambulance service log warns there were ""long delays with unloading at GRH [Gloucestershire Royal Hospital]"" that night. Data seen by the BBC shows that 75% of ambulances were delayed for at least half an hour at Gloucester or its sister hospital in Cheltenham on 24 March, with 54% having to wait for more than an hour. That handover should be completed in under 15 minutes. If paramedics are queuing outside A&E, then they are not able to get back on the road and quickly pick up the next patient who needs help. A doctor's report into Ken's case specifically refers to ""a lack of ambulances available"" that night. Ambulances waiting to unload patients at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital on 13 June, 2022. Another hour passed before he made his third and final call to 999. It was clear now that he was in serious pain. He felt ""terrible sick"" and said his ""breathing is going too"". ""I need an ambulance because I'm going to fade away quite quickly,"" he said. The same reply came back: ""The ambulance service is just under a lot of pressure at the moment... we are doing our best. ""I appreciate that you've been stuck for quite some time, Ken... we've not forgotten about you at all."" Later in the call he said he was cold and could not reach his duvet. He'd already tried phoning one of his neighbours but could not get through, and said they ""might be away"". He was told by the 999 call handler to ""try to stay still"". ""Can you please tell them to hurry up or I shall be dead,"" he said. ""Send me the undertaker, that would be the best bet."" He put the phone down for the last time. Kenneth Shadbolt's son Jerry says his father must have felt abandoned An ambulance finally got to Kenneth Shadbolt's house at 08:10 that morning, four hours after that final call. By then one of his sons had contacted a neighbour, who found him unconscious on his bedroom floor. He arrived at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital at 09:59, and was handed over to the trauma team. A doctor phoned the family and told them to come straight away and explained that his injuries were not survivable. Ken died at 14:21 that afternoon, with the cause of death given as a ""very large subdural haematoma"" or bleed on the brain. His son Jerry Shadbolt said: ""The doctors were saying his injuries were non-survivable but would they have been non-survivable if he'd arrived at hospital four hours earlier? I'd like an answer to that question. ""He was on his own and he knew he was on his own. He must have felt abandoned and alone on his bedroom floor. That's the most troubling part of it for me."" Jenny Winslade, executive director of quality and clinical care for the South Western Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust, offered her ""sincere condolences"" to the family and friends of Mr Shadbolt. She said delays handing over patients to A&E, and busy hospitals, meant it was ""taking us too long to get an ambulance to patients"". ""This is a risk which we recognise is unacceptable,"" she said. ""We continue to work on a daily basis with our partners to ensure our crews can get back out on the road as quickly as possible, to respond to other 999 calls."" Prof Mark Pietroni, medical director and acting chief executive of Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, said local and national health systems were ""under intense pressure"" and continued to face significant challenges ""in response to unrelenting demand"". The trust said that, currently, 240 hospital patients - out of a total of 837 beds for patients - were waiting for support to go home or be moved to other locations in the community. Doctors and paramedics have become increasingly concerned about long ambulance wait times across the UK this year. In England as a whole, the average response for a category two emergency, such as a heart attack or stroke, was almost 40 minutes in May - more than twice as long as the 18-minute target. Last month, Dr Katherine Henderson, an A&E consultant and president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine,described the situation as ""more serious than we've ever seen it"". She said the problem is often caused by delays discharging patients from hospital wards into a care setting, which then creates a bottleneck in A&E, leaving no space for new patients arriving by ambulance. The BBC has spoken to people who have spent hours waiting outside emergency departments this year, sometimes transferred between different ambulance vehicles because there is no room to treat them in the hospital itself. The Healthcare Safety Investigation Branch (HSIB) says the delays are causing harm to patients, including some deaths. Its final report will be published later this year, but the interim findings - released on Thursday - show that staff who have witnessed harm to patients and their families are traumatised. ""Harm is happening on a daily basis,"" said the HSIB's national investigator Neil Alexander. He referred to patients deteriorating in ambulances while waiting for treatment in emergency departments, and patients getting infections in hospital because they were staying there too long. ""And we are no longer using the word 'risk' in this investigation, because risk is being realised and is now harm,"" Mr Alexander said. The government said it would carefully consider the HSIB's report and would ""respond in due course"". ""The NHS has allocated Â£150m of additional funding to address pressures on ambulance services, with the number of ambulance and support staff increasing by almost 40% since February 2010,"" said a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Social Care. ""We have also established a national taskforce to identify ways to reduce delayed discharges and ensure patients are only in hospital for as long as they need to be.""

"The pound's weakness against the dollar and the euro spells bad news for British holidaymakers this summer. Fears over the UK economy are weighing on markets, causing sterling to sink below $1.20 on Tuesday, its lowest level since the start of the pandemic, before partly recovering on Wednesday. Versus the euro, the pound is hovering near thirteen-month lows. As a result many Brits travelling in the next few weeks will find their spending money won't stretch as far. ""The pound remains a very vulnerable currency,"" said Jane Foley, head of foreign exchange strategy at the Dutch bank Rabobank. ""A lot of this is related to fears about growth,"" she continued, noting that political uncertainty and a potential trade conflict with the European Union were likely to add to investors' concerns about the UK's economic outlook. Fears for UK economy grow as higher prices bite Warning UK to see slowest growth of developed nations Why are prices rising so quickly? The weakness of the pound will ""add to the gloom"" for British holidaymakers, who are already facing the prospect of travel disruption, said Ms Foley. After more than two years of Covid restrictions, many people are planning their first trips overseas, with the peak summer holiday season and the long school break hovering on the horizon. But when they get there, they could find the pound in their pocket doesn't go as far, Ms Foley warned. ""If you're going to the Eurozone or the United States, you're going to be able to purchase less,"" she said. ""When we look at the dollar, it's very strong, so holidaymakers going to the US are really going to see the weakness."" Some holidaymakers will already have adjusted for this, however. ""Sterling's been on the backfoot for several years, so to some extent this weakness is already expected,"" Ms Foley said. Are UK travellers heading for a summer of misery? Fears have grown over the prospects for the UK economy afterfigures showed it shrank again in Aprilfor the second month in a row, with businesses feeling the impact of rising prices. There is uncertainty over how fast the Bank of England - which is expected to raise interest rates again on Thursday - can tighten policy this year to tame inflation without further hurting the economy further. However the pound's weakness is also a result of a strong dollar, Ms Foley said, with rising interest rates there making the US currency more attractive. ""A more aggressive pace of US interest rate hikes is certainly propping up the dollar,"" she said. The US central bank, the Federal Reserve, is expected to raise rates substantially after its policy meeting on Wednesday, to try to curb rising inflation there. ""Also, the dollar does have this safe haven appeal, so when we're looking at concerns perhaps about China, perhaps about the gas crisis in Europe, a large part of this does create an environment where people want to hold dollars.""

"This video can not be played Wayne Humphreys' fine and costs for passing this cyclist too closely were more than Â£1,800 A motorist has been ordered to pay more than Â£1,800 after passing a cyclist too closely. Wayne Humphreys, 77, was fined and given four penalty points for failing to leave enough space in his Audi Q8. Road safety partnership GoSafe said the outcome showed that these submissions are taken seriously and given the appropriate amount of attention. Mr Humphreys had refused to attend a course or pay a fixed penalty notice, but said the fine was ""appalling"". GoSafe said Mr Humphreys had been offered a place on a driver awareness course as an alternative to prosecution after it received footage of the incident. The cyclist recorded the close pass on a GoPro camera and reported the incident to roads policing teams. GoSafe added that Mr Humphreys, of Pontyclun, Rhondda Cynon Taf, also later failed to comply with a fixed penalty notice, resulting in the prosecution on 8 June, when he was fined Â£1,152 and ordered to pay Â£620 costs and a Â£115 victim surcharge. The warehouse boss was then prosecuted at Cardiff Magistrates' Court for driving without due care and attention and ordered to pay Â£1,887 in a fine and costs, and received four points on his licence. Mr Humphreys, said: ""The fine is absolutely appalling. I am 77 years of age and the last fine I had was 35 to 40 years ago.

Cyclist confronts driver over 'disgusting' comments Bike passing distance signs a 'UK first' Following the narrow miss along the B4280 Pant Hirwaun outside Heol-y-Cyw, near Bridgend in September 2021, Mr Humphreys said he and his son later measured the road and claimed the gap he left for the cyclist was sufficient and safe. He said: ""Taking into account the cyclist and his bike, there would have still been at least 4ft (1.2m) space."" Motorists must now leave a 1.5m (5ft) gap when overtaking cyclists, as well as slowing down. The gap must be 2m (6.5ft) when passing pedestrians or horse riders.

New laws came into force in January ""I find it absolutely incredible this has happened. I don't know whether to appeal it or not. It will probably just cost me more money. ""This has already cost me about Â£4,500 with the money for the court and the solicitor. It doesn't make sense to me."" This video can not be played What's changed in the Highway Code?

"France's President Macron says European leaders are supportive of Ukraine gaining ""immediate"" candidate status to join the EU Macron, Germany's Olaf Scholz and Italy's Mario Draghi were earlier welcomed to the Presidential Palace in Kyiv by President Zelensky The EU leaders inspected war damage on a visit to the town of Irpin which Russian troops occupied at the war's start Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov defends Russiaâs actions in Ukraine, in an interview with the BBC Lavrov also criticises the UK for its policy towards Russia Meanwhile, 10,000 civilians are trapped in the embattled eastern city of Severodonetsk, a regional governor says We're pausing our live coverage of the war in Ukraine for now. Today's updates were brought to you by Paul Gribben, Nathan Williams, Holly Wallis, Catherine Evans, Emily McGarvey, James Clarke, Chris Giles, James FitzGerald and Alex Kleiderman. President Zelensky welcomed France's President Macron to Kyiv Thanks for joining today's coverage of the war in Ukraine. Here's a quick look back at some of Thursday's key developments. Kyiv's EU bid backed by four leaders  Lavrov defends invasion  Other headlines  Russia's aggression in Ukraine is a game-changer, Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has said. Stoltenberg has been speaking in Brussels where defence ministers from member countries of the military alliance and a handful of other allies have been meeting to discuss the situation in Ukraine. He says progress has been made in many areas and, in a meeting with the Ukrainian defence minister last night, they discussed the ""imperative need for our continued support as Russia conducts a relentless war of attrition against Ukraine"". Stoltenberg says Ukraine's allies have announced additional assistance, ""including much-needed heavy weapons and long range systems"" and also discussed plans to support the country for the longer term and to step up Nato's ""presence, capabilities and readiness"". The Russian Orthodox Church has dismissed sanctions against its leader, Patriarch Kirill, imposed by Britain for his support of Moscow's military intervention in Ukraine. It targeted the 75-year-old cleric and ally of President Vladimir Putin two weeks after the EU dropped him from their own sanctions list after opposition from Hungary. ""Attempts to intimidate the primate of the Russian Church with something or to force him to renounce his views are senseless, absurd and unpromising,"" church spokesman Vladimir Legoyda said on Telegram. He added that the Church was ""the last bridge, a means of communication, which they are trying to destroy for some reason. ""This may be necessary only for those political forces that have the escalation of conflict and the alienation of peace as their important goal,"" Legoyda said. Vitaliy ShevchenkoReporting from Moscow Officials installed by Moscow in recently occupied areas of Ukraine say newly-born children there will be given Russian citizenship. This will apply to babies born in the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions since the start of the Russian invasion on 24 February, state-run news agency RIA Novosti reports. Currently, most of the two regions are under Russian occupation. The deputy head of the Russia-backed administration in the Kherson region, Kirill Stremousov,told RIA Novosti,externalon 16 February that newborns will be given Russian citizenship ""automatically"". Vladimir Rogov, a member of the Russia-backed administration in occupied parts of the Zaporizhzhia region,told RIA Novosti,externalthat the instruction to give Russian citizenship to newborns came from Vladimir Putin's office. In May, Putin issued a decree simplifying the procedure of obtaining Russian citizenship for residents of the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions.The EU called it,externalpart of Russia's attempts to ""forcefully integrate"" parts of Ukrainian territory and said it will not recognise Russian passports issued there. The Russian military has been focusing its efforts on the Bakhmut area of the Donetsk region and a continued assault on Severodonetsk, Ukraine's General Staff said in a Facebook update earlier today. ""The enemy keeps trying to establish full control over the city of Severodonetsk. They are storming the city, and the fighting continues,"" the report says. The Russian army has opened fire on Ukrainian units in various areas in or near Severodonetsk and shelled a number of towns in the Bakhmut area - but also towns and cities in other parts of the country too. Ukrainian soldiers ""uncovered and destroyed an enemy sabotage and reconnaissance group"" on the route between Yehorivka and Shevchenko in the Donetsk Region, the General Staff said. Macron speaking alongside Ukraine's President Zelensky earlier French arms manufacturer Nexter has been asked by President Macron to increase its production of Caesar howitzer weapons, a source close to the defence ministry tells Reuters. Nexter is being urged to work in a ""wartime"" mode, the source says. During a visit to Kyiv earlier, Macron pledged to send Ukraine another six Caesars on top of the 12 previously delivered. Separately, Macron says it's ""up to Ukraine to decide"" whether to accept any territorial concessions with a view to ending the war - speaking to French TV station TF1 after today's visit. Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv The sister of the
Moroccan man who has been sentenced to death by a Russian proxy court in
eastern Ukraine says she feels his story is being ignored - and that he may be
forgotten. Brahim Saadoune was
sentenced alongside Britons Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner, who have received
much more coverage. Saadoune, 21, was studying in Ukraine but signed up to fight in the defence of Mariupol. When he surrendered
- he was put on trial, along with the other two, not as a soldier but a
mercenary. âAt first, when they captured all of them, then it was like different news about every person,â
Imane Saadoune says. âThere wasn't much
attention on my brotherâ¦ he was left aside a little bit.â The three men do
have a chance to appeal but the separatists have said they see no reason not to
put them to death. It has been left to Brahim's friends to campaign for his life. âHe has a lot of
support. His friends, they are real friends, just starting many campaigns for
him. I just want to tell him that he is loved. He's really loved.â Morocco's main national rights body has now condemned the sentencing, calling for Brahim Saadoune to be extradited to Morocco. Meanwhile, state-run MAP news agency is reporting comments by Morocco's diplomatic sources noting that he was being held by a body not recognised by either the UN or Morocco. Brahim Saadoune (R) was sentenced with Aiden Aslin (L) and Shaun Pinner (C) More now from the BBC interview with Russia's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov. Lavrov has insisted that courts in an
area of eastern Ukraine run by Russian-backed separatists are truly independent. He was being questioned about two Britons
recently given death sentences by a court in the self-proclaimed Donetsk
Peopleâs Republic â after being captured while fighting alongside Ukrainian
troops. Lavrov says he is ânot interestedâ in whether the West views
Russia as responsible for their fate. âI am only interested in international law,â he says. âAccording
to international law, mercenaries are not recognised as combatants.â The families of Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner deny that the
two men were mercenaries, instead saying they are long-serving members of the
Ukrainian military. Challenged with that claim, Lavrov responds âthis should be
decided by a court"". President Zelensky met European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen in April Ukraine's hopes of swiftly joining the European Union received a boost earlier, as the leaders of the EU's three largest economies agreed during a visit to Kyiv that the country should get ""immediate"" candidate status. But that would be just the start of what's expected to be a long journey towards accession for Ukraine. The country's candidacy itself is something that would need to be agreed by all 27 of the EU's member states, following today's positive signals from Germany, France, Italy and Romania. That could happen during an EU summit on 23-24 June. There would then follow a negotiation stage, during which Ukraine could be asked to agree to reforms. These could see Kyiv asked to sign up to a set of values that align with the EU's own.

The White House says it is ""working very hard to learn more"" about two US citizens who are missing in Ukraine.

actions in neighbouring Ukraine, during an exclusive interview with the BBC. âRussia is not squeaky clean,â Sergei Lavrov admits in

not ashamed of showing who we are.â The minister claimed the United Nations is âbeing used to
amplify fake news from the West,â after being read quotes from a UN report
detailing alleged Russian war crimes. Of the invasion itself, Lavrov says: âWe had absolutely no

government to try to âdefeatâ Russia over its actions in Ukraine. In an exclusive interview with the BBCâs Russia Editor, Steve
Rosenberg, he says he doesnât think thereâs âroom for manoeuvre anymoreâ in
terms of relations between Russia and the UK. âBoth [UK PM Boris] Johnson and [Foreign Secretary Liz] Truss say openly that we
should defeat Russia, we should force Russia to its knees,â says Lavrov. âGo on then, do it!â he adds. Lavrov goes on to accuse the UK of âonce again sacrificing
the interests of its people for the sake of political ambitions.â He continues: âTheir politicians think only about the next
election and nothing else.â Like other Western nations, the UK has provided Ukraine with
weapons to fight Russian invaders â and has also targeted Moscow with
sanctions. Jonathan BealeBBC defence correspondent Britainâs Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has said âthe momentum is still in Ukraineâs favourâ in its fight with Russia. âThat doesnât mean the big Russian war machine is going backwards,â he said, âbut it is not advancing according to their plans"". In an interview with the BBC at a Nato ministerial meeting in Brussels, Mr Wallace said that in some places, Russian artillery outnumbered Ukraineâs by as much as 20 to one. But he said that western nations were now sending more heavy weapons to address the imbalance. Britain has already announced it will be sending Ukraine a small number of multiple rocket launchers â taken from the British Armyâs stock. But Mr Wallace confirmed that Britain would also be  sending 20 self-propelled  artillery  guns to Ukraine. Those artillery guns have been bought from a Belgian arms company to send directly to Ukraine. Mr Wallace said that Britain was still determined to help lead the contributions of weapons to Ukraine. But he said âwe donât have everything in our armed forcesâ. The defence secretary said western nations were also learning lessons about their own âvulnerabilitiesâ from the war in Ukraine - one of them was the need for stocks of ammunition. He added that one of the limiting factors for supplying Ukraine with weapons was âwhat people have on their shelvesâ. Joel GunterReporting from Momotove, near Kharkiv In a field about six miles from the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, the J9 army unit is doing its grim job - digging up bodies of Russian soldiers. In a shallow mass grave under a tree, there are six dead, piled on top of one another in a rough heap. No one here knows who buried them - local residents or retreating Russians. The bodies are swarmed by flies and the smell is overpowering, but the members of the J9 unit and the two diggers who help them are unfazed. They are used to it. The J9 soldiers and gravediggers, including Yurii (front right), carry the bodies out Yurii, one of the gravediggers, got this job after he found five bodies buried in his own garden in a different village, and called the J9 unit to dig them up. ""I helped them dig and they liked the way I worked, because I was a gravedigger before, so now I'm helping them,"" he said. That means going from village to village, every day, exhuming bodies - Ukrainians and Russians. These dead Russians will be taken to the morgue, sampled for identification, and eventually swapped for Ukrainian dead. Yurii served in the army in the Soviet Union. ""Someone is waiting for these men â their fathers and mothers, children,"" he said. âI understand that.â Nick BeakeReporting from Kyiv On the fringe of the joint press conference, I
caught up with Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine's foreign minister. I asked him whether the latest weapons
announced today are too little, too late considering weâre told up to as many
as 200 Ukrainian soldiers are being lost every day in Donbas. ""The announcements of new weapons
delivered to Ukraine should be made on a weekly basis. And these weapons should
be delivered in sufficient quantities. This is the reality. We appreciate
everything that has been done, we do not complain,"" he told me. ""But the truth is that we're still
outnumbered when it comes to artillery, multiple launch rocket systems and
defence systems, and we cannot make any big progress until we strike a balance
with Russia in the numbers on these three positions. ""So do not get me wrong. I'm not complaining. I appreciate
everything that has been done. I appreciate these announcements, but just to
strike the balance, as I said, these announcements should be made a weekly
basis and in sufficient quantities."" There was a joint press conference with the leaders from Ukraine, Germany, France, Italy and Romania We've been hearing from Ukraine's president and the leaders of Germany, France, Italy and Romania who've been in Kyiv for talks. Here's what we learned from their joint press conference:  Ukraine is ""ready to work"" to become
a full European Union member, President Zelensky said after meeting four
visiting EU leaders for talks in Kyiv. At a news conference in the Ukrainian capital
French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Italian Prime
Minister Mario Draghi and Romanian President Klaus Iohannis all publicly backed
Kyiv's bid to join the bloc. EU leaders are holding a summit next week at
which Kyiv's application to become a candidate for membership is likely to be
given a green light. Zelensky said: ""Ukrainians have already earned the right to
go down this road and obtain this candidate status."" Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,0.005876822

Today's updates were brought to you by Paul Gribben, Nathan Williams, Holly Wallis, Catherine Evans, Emily McGarvey, James Clarke, Chris Giles, James FitzGerald and Alex Kleiderman. President Zelensky welcomed France's President Macron to Kyiv Thanks for joining today's coverage of the war in Ukraine. Here's a quick look back at some of Thursday's key developments. Kyiv's EU bid backed by four leaders  Lavrov defends invasion  Other headlines  Russia's aggression in Ukraine is a game-changer, Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has said. Stoltenberg has been speaking in Brussels where defence ministers from member countries of the military alliance and a handful of other allies have been meeting to discuss the situation in Ukraine. He says progress has been made in many areas and, in a meeting with the Ukrainian defence minister last night, they discussed the ""imperative need for our continued support as Russia conducts a relentless war of attrition against Ukraine"". Stoltenberg says Ukraine's allies have announced additional assistance, ""including much-needed heavy weapons and long range systems"" and also discussed plans to support the country for the longer term and to step up Nato's ""presence, capabilities and readiness"". The Russian Orthodox Church has dismissed sanctions against its leader, Patriarch Kirill, imposed by Britain for his support of Moscow's military intervention in Ukraine. It targeted the 75-year-old cleric and ally of President Vladimir Putin two weeks after the EU dropped him from their own sanctions list after opposition from Hungary. ""Attempts to intimidate the primate of the Russian Church with something or to force him to renounce his views are senseless, absurd and unpromising,"" church spokesman Vladimir Legoyda said on Telegram. He added that the Church was ""the last bridge, a means of communication, which they are trying to destroy for some reason. ""This may be necessary only for those political forces that have the escalation of conflict and the alienation of peace as their important goal,"" Legoyda said. Vitaliy ShevchenkoReporting from Moscow Officials installed by Moscow in recently occupied areas of Ukraine say newly-born children there will be given Russian citizenship. This will apply to babies born in the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions since the start of the Russian invasion on 24 February, state-run news agency RIA Novosti reports. Currently, most of the two regions are under Russian occupation. The deputy head of the Russia-backed administration in the Kherson region, Kirill Stremousov,told RIA Novosti,externalon 16 February that newborns will be given Russian citizenship ""automatically"". Vladimir Rogov, a member of the Russia-backed administration in occupied parts of the Zaporizhzhia region,told RIA Novosti,externalthat the instruction to give Russian citizenship to newborns came from Vladimir Putin's office. In May, Putin issued a decree simplifying the procedure of obtaining Russian citizenship for residents of the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions.The EU called it,externalpart of Russia's attempts to ""forcefully integrate"" parts of Ukrainian territory and said it will not recognise Russian passports issued there. The Russian military has been focusing its efforts on the Bakhmut area of the Donetsk region and a continued assault on Severodonetsk, Ukraine's General Staff said in a Facebook update earlier today. ""The enemy keeps trying to establish full control over the city of Severodonetsk. They are storming the city, and the fighting continues,"" the report says. The Russian army has opened fire on Ukrainian units in various areas in or near Severodonetsk and shelled a number of towns in the Bakhmut area - but also towns and cities in other parts of the country too. Ukrainian soldiers ""uncovered and destroyed an enemy sabotage and reconnaissance group"" on the route between Yehorivka and Shevchenko in the Donetsk Region, the General Staff said. Macron speaking alongside Ukraine's President Zelensky earlier French arms manufacturer Nexter has been asked by President Macron to increase its production of Caesar howitzer weapons, a source close to the defence ministry tells Reuters. Nexter is being urged to work in a ""wartime"" mode, the source says. During a visit to Kyiv earlier, Macron pledged to send Ukraine another six Caesars on top of the 12 previously delivered. Separately, Macron says it's ""up to Ukraine to decide"" whether to accept any territorial concessions with a view to ending the war - speaking to French TV station TF1 after today's visit. Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv The sister of the
Moroccan man who has been sentenced to death by a Russian proxy court in
eastern Ukraine says she feels his story is being ignored - and that he may be
forgotten. Brahim Saadoune was
sentenced alongside Britons Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner, who have received
much more coverage. Saadoune, 21, was studying in Ukraine but signed up to fight in the defence of Mariupol. When he surrendered
- he was put on trial, along with the other two, not as a soldier but a
mercenary. âAt first, when they captured all of them, then it was like different news about every person,â
Imane Saadoune says. âThere wasn't much
attention on my brotherâ¦ he was left aside a little bit.â The three men do
have a chance to appeal but the separatists have said they see no reason not to
put them to death. It has been left to Brahim's friends to campaign for his life. âHe has a lot of
support. His friends, they are real friends, just starting many campaigns for
him. I just want to tell him that he is loved. He's really loved.â Morocco's main national rights body has now condemned the sentencing, calling for Brahim Saadoune to be extradited to Morocco. Meanwhile, state-run MAP news agency is reporting comments by Morocco's diplomatic sources noting that he was being held by a body not recognised by either the UN or Morocco. Brahim Saadoune (R) was sentenced with Aiden Aslin (L) and Shaun Pinner (C) More now from the BBC interview with Russia's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov. Lavrov has insisted that courts in an
area of eastern Ukraine run by Russian-backed separatists are truly independent. He was being questioned about two Britons
recently given death sentences by a court in the self-proclaimed Donetsk
Peopleâs Republic â after being captured while fighting alongside Ukrainian
troops. Lavrov says he is ânot interestedâ in whether the West views
Russia as responsible for their fate. âI am only interested in international law,â he says. âAccording
to international law, mercenaries are not recognised as combatants.â The families of Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner deny that the
two men were mercenaries, instead saying they are long-serving members of the
Ukrainian military. Challenged with that claim, Lavrov responds âthis should be
decided by a court"". President Zelensky met European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen in April Ukraine's hopes of swiftly joining the European Union received a boost earlier, as the leaders of the EU's three largest economies agreed during a visit to Kyiv that the country should get ""immediate"" candidate status. But that would be just the start of what's expected to be a long journey towards accession for Ukraine. The country's candidacy itself is something that would need to be agreed by all 27 of the EU's member states, following today's positive signals from Germany, France, Italy and Romania. That could happen during an EU summit on 23-24 June. There would then follow a negotiation stage, during which Ukraine could be asked to agree to reforms. These could see Kyiv asked to sign up to a set of values that align with the EU's own.

not ashamed of showing who we are.â The minister claimed the United Nations is âbeing used to

government to try to âdefeatâ Russia over its actions in Ukraine. In an exclusive interview with the BBCâs Russia Editor, Steve
Rosenberg, he says he doesnât think thereâs âroom for manoeuvre anymoreâ in
terms of relations between Russia and the UK. âBoth [UK PM Boris] Johnson and [Foreign Secretary Liz] Truss say openly that we
should defeat Russia, we should force Russia to its knees,â says Lavrov. âGo on then, do it!â he adds. Lavrov goes on to accuse the UK of âonce again sacrificing
the interests of its people for the sake of political ambitions.â He continues: âTheir politicians think only about the next
election and nothing else.â Like other Western nations, the UK has provided Ukraine with
weapons to fight Russian invaders â and has also targeted Moscow with
sanctions. Jonathan BealeBBC defence correspondent Britainâs Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has said âthe momentum is still in Ukraineâs favourâ in its fight with Russia. âThat doesnât mean the big Russian war machine is going backwards,â he said, âbut it is not advancing according to their plans"". In an interview with the BBC at a Nato ministerial meeting in Brussels, Mr Wallace said that in some places, Russian artillery outnumbered Ukraineâs by as much as 20 to one. But he said that western nations were now sending more heavy weapons to address the imbalance. Britain has already announced it will be sending Ukraine a small number of multiple rocket launchers â taken from the British Armyâs stock. But Mr Wallace confirmed that Britain would also be  sending 20 self-propelled  artillery  guns to Ukraine. Those artillery guns have been bought from a Belgian arms company to send directly to Ukraine. Mr Wallace said that Britain was still determined to help lead the contributions of weapons to Ukraine. But he said âwe donât have everything in our armed forcesâ. The defence secretary said western nations were also learning lessons about their own âvulnerabilitiesâ from the war in Ukraine - one of them was the need for stocks of ammunition. He added that one of the limiting factors for supplying Ukraine with weapons was âwhat people have on their shelvesâ. Joel GunterReporting from Momotove, near Kharkiv In a field about six miles from the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, the J9 army unit is doing its grim job - digging up bodies of Russian soldiers. In a shallow mass grave under a tree, there are six dead, piled on top of one another in a rough heap. No one here knows who buried them - local residents or retreating Russians. The bodies are swarmed by flies and the smell is overpowering, but the members of the J9 unit and the two diggers who help them are unfazed. They are used to it. The J9 soldiers and gravediggers, including Yurii (front right), carry the bodies out Yurii, one of the gravediggers, got this job after he found five bodies buried in his own garden in a different village, and called the J9 unit to dig them up. ""I helped them dig and they liked the way I worked, because I was a gravedigger before, so now I'm helping them,"" he said. That means going from village to village, every day, exhuming bodies - Ukrainians and Russians. These dead Russians will be taken to the morgue, sampled for identification, and eventually swapped for Ukrainian dead. Yurii served in the army in the Soviet Union. ""Someone is waiting for these men â their fathers and mothers, children,"" he said. âI understand that.â Nick BeakeReporting from Kyiv On the fringe of the joint press conference, I
caught up with Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine's foreign minister. I asked him whether the latest weapons
announced today are too little, too late considering weâre told up to as many
as 200 Ukrainian soldiers are being lost every day in Donbas. ""The announcements of new weapons
delivered to Ukraine should be made on a weekly basis. And these weapons should
be delivered in sufficient quantities. This is the reality. We appreciate
everything that has been done, we do not complain,"" he told me. ""But the truth is that we're still
outnumbered when it comes to artillery, multiple launch rocket systems and
defence systems, and we cannot make any big progress until we strike a balance
with Russia in the numbers on these three positions. ""So do not get me wrong. I'm not complaining. I appreciate
everything that has been done. I appreciate these announcements, but just to
strike the balance, as I said, these announcements should be made a weekly
basis and in sufficient quantities."" There was a joint press conference with the leaders from Ukraine, Germany, France, Italy and Romania We've been hearing from Ukraine's president and the leaders of Germany, France, Italy and Romania who've been in Kyiv for talks.

French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Italian Prime
Minister Mario Draghi and Romanian President Klaus Iohannis all publicly backed
Kyiv's bid to join the bloc. EU leaders are holding a summit next week at

"France's President Macron says European leaders are supportive of Ukraine gaining ""immediate"" candidate status to join the EU Macron, Germany's Olaf Scholz and Italy's Mario Draghi were earlier welcomed to the Presidential Palace in Kyiv by President Zelensky The EU leaders inspected war damage on a visit to the town of Irpin which Russian troops occupied at the war's start Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov defends Russiaâs actions in Ukraine, in an interview with the BBC Lavrov also criticises the UK for its policy towards Russia Meanwhile, 10,000 civilians are trapped in the embattled eastern city of Severodonetsk, a regional governor says We're pausing our live coverage of the war in Ukraine for now. Today's updates were brought to you by Paul Gribben, Nathan Williams, Holly Wallis, Catherine Evans, Emily McGarvey, James Clarke, Chris Giles, James FitzGerald and Alex Kleiderman. President Zelensky welcomed France's President Macron to Kyiv Thanks for joining today's coverage of the war in Ukraine. Here's a quick look back at some of Thursday's key developments. Kyiv's EU bid backed by four leaders  Lavrov defends invasion  Other headlines  Russia's aggression in Ukraine is a game-changer, Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has said. Stoltenberg has been speaking in Brussels where defence ministers from member countries of the military alliance and a handful of other allies have been meeting to discuss the situation in Ukraine. He says progress has been made in many areas and, in a meeting with the Ukrainian defence minister last night, they discussed the ""imperative need for our continued support as Russia conducts a relentless war of attrition against Ukraine"". Stoltenberg says Ukraine's allies have announced additional assistance, ""including much-needed heavy weapons and long range systems"" and also discussed plans to support the country for the longer term and to step up Nato's ""presence, capabilities and readiness"". The Russian Orthodox Church has dismissed sanctions against its leader, Patriarch Kirill, imposed by Britain for his support of Moscow's military intervention in Ukraine. It targeted the 75-year-old cleric and ally of President Vladimir Putin two weeks after the EU dropped him from their own sanctions list after opposition from Hungary. ""Attempts to intimidate the primate of the Russian Church with something or to force him to renounce his views are senseless, absurd and unpromising,"" church spokesman Vladimir Legoyda said on Telegram. He added that the Church was ""the last bridge, a means of communication, which they are trying to destroy for some reason. ""This may be necessary only for those political forces that have the escalation of conflict and the alienation of peace as their important goal,"" Legoyda said. Vitaliy ShevchenkoReporting from Moscow Officials installed by Moscow in recently occupied areas of Ukraine say newly-born children there will be given Russian citizenship. This will apply to babies born in the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions since the start of the Russian invasion on 24 February, state-run news agency RIA Novosti reports. Currently, most of the two regions are under Russian occupation. The deputy head of the Russia-backed administration in the Kherson region, Kirill Stremousov,told RIA Novosti,externalon 16 February that newborns will be given Russian citizenship ""automatically"". Vladimir Rogov, a member of the Russia-backed administration in occupied parts of the Zaporizhzhia region,told RIA Novosti,externalthat the instruction to give Russian citizenship to newborns came from Vladimir Putin's office. In May, Putin issued a decree simplifying the procedure of obtaining Russian citizenship for residents of the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions.The EU called it,externalpart of Russia's attempts to ""forcefully integrate"" parts of Ukrainian territory and said it will not recognise Russian passports issued there. The Russian military has been focusing its efforts on the Bakhmut area of the Donetsk region and a continued assault on Severodonetsk, Ukraine's General Staff said in a Facebook update earlier today. ""The enemy keeps trying to establish full control over the city of Severodonetsk. They are storming the city, and the fighting continues,"" the report says. The Russian army has opened fire on Ukrainian units in various areas in or near Severodonetsk and shelled a number of towns in the Bakhmut area - but also towns and cities in other parts of the country too. Ukrainian soldiers ""uncovered and destroyed an enemy sabotage and reconnaissance group"" on the route between Yehorivka and Shevchenko in the Donetsk Region, the General Staff said. Macron speaking alongside Ukraine's President Zelensky earlier French arms manufacturer Nexter has been asked by President Macron to increase its production of Caesar howitzer weapons, a source close to the defence ministry tells Reuters. Nexter is being urged to work in a ""wartime"" mode, the source says. During a visit to Kyiv earlier, Macron pledged to send Ukraine another six Caesars on top of the 12 previously delivered. Separately, Macron says it's ""up to Ukraine to decide"" whether to accept any territorial concessions with a view to ending the war - speaking to French TV station TF1 after today's visit. Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv The sister of the
Moroccan man who has been sentenced to death by a Russian proxy court in
eastern Ukraine says she feels his story is being ignored - and that he may be
forgotten. Brahim Saadoune was
sentenced alongside Britons Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner, who have received
much more coverage. Saadoune, 21, was studying in Ukraine but signed up to fight in the defence of Mariupol. When he surrendered
- he was put on trial, along with the other two, not as a soldier but a
mercenary. âAt first, when they captured all of them, then it was like different news about every person,â
Imane Saadoune says. âThere wasn't much
attention on my brotherâ¦ he was left aside a little bit.â The three men do
have a chance to appeal but the separatists have said they see no reason not to
put them to death. It has been left to Brahim's friends to campaign for his life. âHe has a lot of
support. His friends, they are real friends, just starting many campaigns for
him. I just want to tell him that he is loved. He's really loved.â Morocco's main national rights body has now condemned the sentencing, calling for Brahim Saadoune to be extradited to Morocco. Meanwhile, state-run MAP news agency is reporting comments by Morocco's diplomatic sources noting that he was being held by a body not recognised by either the UN or Morocco. Brahim Saadoune (R) was sentenced with Aiden Aslin (L) and Shaun Pinner (C) More now from the BBC interview with Russia's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov. Lavrov has insisted that courts in an
area of eastern Ukraine run by Russian-backed separatists are truly independent. He was being questioned about two Britons
recently given death sentences by a court in the self-proclaimed Donetsk
Peopleâs Republic â after being captured while fighting alongside Ukrainian
troops. Lavrov says he is ânot interestedâ in whether the West views
Russia as responsible for their fate. âI am only interested in international law,â he says. âAccording
to international law, mercenaries are not recognised as combatants.â The families of Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner deny that the
two men were mercenaries, instead saying they are long-serving members of the
Ukrainian military. Challenged with that claim, Lavrov responds âthis should be
decided by a court"". President Zelensky met European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen in April Ukraine's hopes of swiftly joining the European Union received a boost earlier, as the leaders of the EU's three largest economies agreed during a visit to Kyiv that the country should get ""immediate"" candidate status. But that would be just the start of what's expected to be a long journey towards accession for Ukraine. The country's candidacy itself is something that would need to be agreed by all 27 of the EU's member states, following today's positive signals from Germany, France, Italy and Romania. That could happen during an EU summit on 23-24 June. There would then follow a negotiation stage, during which Ukraine could be asked to agree to reforms. These could see Kyiv asked to sign up to a set of values that align with the EU's own. It would likely be asked to stamp out corruption; an issue for which the country was notorious before the invasion. Other hopeful joiners, including a number of Balkan countries, have been stuck at the negotiating stage for years. And EU officials - as well as France's President Macron, who visited Kyiv today - have previously cautioned that it could even take decades for the process to be completed in Ukraine's case.

"ScotRail says it will have to cancel more than 90% of its usual services when a UK-wide strike by signal workers takes place next week. Members of the RMT union working for Network Rail are due to take action next Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. ScotRail says it will only be able to run about 180 services on five routes in the central belt, and warns there will also be disruption on other days. The train operator usually operates 2,150 services on its full timetable. It is currently running a reduced timetable of about 1,500 services due to a separate pay dispute with the drivers' union Aslef, which is now asking its members to accept a revised deal. On the strike days of 21, 23 and 25 June, ScotRail will only run trains on the routes from Edinburgh to Glasgow via Falkirk High; Edinburgh to Bathgate; Glasgow to Hamilton/Larkhall; Glasgow to Lanark; Edinburgh to Glasgow via Shotts. Rail lines will only be open between 07:30 and 18:30, and ScotRail says the last trains will depart well before 18.30. Information for passengers will be availableon its website,external. Other operators will also run some trains on the east coast and west coast mainlines. ScotRail's service delivery director David Simpson said: ""Customers should expect significant disruption to services next week, including on the days between strike action. ""On the five routes where we are able to operate a very limited service on strike days, we're advising customers to seek alternative means of transport and to only travel if they really need to."" Passengers told not to travel by train during strikes Railway workers to strike over three days in June Late weekday trains return after pay breakthrough Events happening in Scotland on the strike days include the Royal Highland Show in Edinburgh, which runs from 23 June to 26 June, and a Barry Manilow concert at the Hydro in Glasgow on 23 June. The industrial action, which has been described as the ""biggest rail strike in modern history"", is expected to involve more than 40,000 RMT members. This includes staff working for Network Rail Scotland and cross-border train operators LNER, CrossCounty, Avanti West Coast and TransPennine Express. Although ScotRail and Caledonian Sleeper staff are not participating in the strike, their services will also be disrupted. The signal workers are employed by Network Rail, which manages most of the UK's railway tracks and stations. Network Rail Scotland's route director Liam Sumpter said: ""We understand the disruption this strike will cause and apologise to passengers for the impact on their journeys. ""We are continuing talks with our trade unions to seek a compromise that would avoid this damaging strike action."" The RMT has said it is open to meaningful negotiations, and that its members have been subject to pay freezes, threats to jobs and attacks on their terms and conditions. The action is separate to the dispute between ScotRail and the Aslef union, which has seenhundreds of trains cancelledeach day after many drivers opted not to work overtime. Some late night rail services resumed after a breakthrough in pay talks last week. Aslef says it is now recommending that its members accept the deal on the table.

"The PM's ethics adviser has quit a day after saying there was a ""legitimate question"" about whether Boris Johnson broke ministerial rules over Partygate. Lord Geidt did not give a reason for leaving the role he took in 2021, but said it was the ""right thing"" to do. His predecessor, Sir Alex Allan, quit in 2020 after Mr Johnson overruled him over a report into alleged bullying by Home Secretary Priti Patel. The government said it was ""surprised"" by Lord Geidt's decision. ""Whilst we are disappointed, we thank Lord Geidt for his public service,"" a spokesperson added. The spokesperson gave no reason for the resignation but said Lord Geidt had been asked this week ""to provide advice on a commercially sensitive matter in the national interest, which has previously had cross-party support. No decision had been taken pending that advice"". No 10 did not make it clear what these comments referred to. Justice Secretary Dominic Raab said there were ""questions around the detail of the resignation"" and said No 10 would provide an update later on Thursday. He added that Lord Geidt had had a ""pretty rough grilling by MPs this week"" and that media an politicians ""maybe underestimate how civil servants feel with that kind of scrutiny"". Explain why Partygate did not breach code, PM told PM's Partygate fine may have broken code, MPs told Boris Johnson appoints new ministerial standards adviser A Downing Street source told the BBC that Lord Geidt's resignation had been a ""total surprise and a mystery"" to the prime minister, adding: ""Only on Monday Lord Geidt asked if he could stay on for six months."" Labour's Chris Bryant, chairman of the Commons' Committee on Standards and Privileges, told Radio 4's Today that Lord Geidt's resignation letter should be published, adding: ""I hope the Cabinet Office will publish that letter today,"" Sir Philip Mawer, a former parliamentary commissioner for standards, echoed these calls and said: ""If the letter and the prime minister's reply are not published then I think people will draw their own conclusion and it will not be favourable."" He said he had been ""disappointed but not surprised"" at Lord Geidt's resignation, adding there had been a ""succession of failures"" on the part of the prime minister and ""it's not just Partygate"". Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner said: ""The prime minister has now driven both of his own handpicked ethics advisers to resign in despair. ""If even they can't defend his conduct in office, how can anyone believe he is fit to govern?"" Liberal Democrat chief whip Wendy Chamberlain said: ""When both of Boris Johnson's own ethics advisers have quit, it is obvious that he is the one who needs to go."" Born in 1961, Christopher Geidt is a former army intelligence officer who later worked as a diplomat in Sarajevo, Brussels and Geneva In 2002, he began working for the Royal Household and served as the Queen's private secretary for 10 years from 2007 He stepped down after a ""power struggle"" between Buckingham Palace and the Prince of Wales, the Times reported in 2017 Lord Geidt is chairman of King's College London and also chairs a board of the investment firm Schroders He lives on the Isle of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides, where he grew up and where he now has a sheep farm. He is married with two daughters Former cabinet secretary Lord Turnbull said of Mr Johnson: ""The pattern of behaviour is that anyone who has the power to criticise, obstruct or force him to change, he will try to reduce their power, suborn them or in the last resort wave them aside."" But he told BBC Newsnight that ""the charge sheet of Boris Johnson's conduct is now so long that one accusation isn't going to make any difference"", adding the prime minister would only leave office if he was removed as Tory leader by MPs. It was reported that Lord Geidt had threatened to quit last month after the publication of the Sue Gray report into lockdown breaches in Downing Street unless Mr Johnson issued a public explanation for his conduct. Appearing before a committee of MPs on Tuesday, Lord Geidt said: ""Resignation is one of the rather blunt but few tools available to the adviser. I am glad that my frustrations were addressed in the way that they were."" But, in a brief written statement,externalon Wednesday, he said: ""With regret, I feel that it is right that I am resigning from my post as independent adviser on ministers' interests."" On Wednesday evening, Lord Geidt phoned the prime minister's principal private secretary to tell him he was resigning. Mr Johnson was informed of the decision at about 18:30 BST, shortly after finishing a phone call with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky. But while the particular timing has surprised some in Downing Street, Lord Geidt's discomfort in the job has been evident for a while. Just last month he had said in a report that it was a legitimate question to ask if Boris Johnson had breached the ministerial code by breaking Covid laws. Lord Geidt also spelled out in the report that he didn't like the terms of his job - ""the prevailing arrangements still remained insufficiently independent to be able to command the confidence of the public"" as he put it.

"The PM's ethics adviser has quit a day after saying there was a ""legitimate question"" about whether Boris Johnson broke ministerial rules over Partygate. Lord Geidt did not give a reason for leaving the role he took in 2021, but said it was the ""right thing"" to do. His predecessor, Sir Alex Allan, quit in 2020 after Mr Johnson overruled him over a report into alleged bullying by Home Secretary Priti Patel. The government said it was ""surprised"" by Lord Geidt's decision. ""Whilst we are disappointed, we thank Lord Geidt for his public service,"" a spokesperson added. The spokesperson gave no reason for the resignation but said Lord Geidt had been asked this week ""to provide advice on a commercially sensitive matter in the national interest, which has previously had cross-party support. No decision had been taken pending that advice"". No 10 did not make it clear what these comments referred to. Justice Secretary Dominic Raab said there were ""questions around the detail of the resignation"" and said No 10 would provide an update later on Thursday. He added that Lord Geidt had had a ""pretty rough grilling by MPs this week"" and that media an politicians ""maybe underestimate how civil servants feel with that kind of scrutiny"". Explain why Partygate did not breach code, PM told PM's Partygate fine may have broken code, MPs told Boris Johnson appoints new ministerial standards adviser A Downing Street source told the BBC that Lord Geidt's resignation had been a ""total surprise and a mystery"" to the prime minister, adding: ""Only on Monday Lord Geidt asked if he could stay on for six months."" Labour's Chris Bryant, chairman of the Commons' Committee on Standards and Privileges, told Radio 4's Today that Lord Geidt's resignation letter should be published, adding: ""I hope the Cabinet Office will publish that letter today,"" Sir Philip Mawer, a former parliamentary commissioner for standards, echoed these calls and said: ""If the letter and the prime minister's reply are not published then I think people will draw their own conclusion and it will not be favourable."" He said he had been ""disappointed but not surprised"" at Lord Geidt's resignation, adding there had been a ""succession of failures"" on the part of the prime minister and ""it's not just Partygate"". Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner said: ""The prime minister has now driven both of his own handpicked ethics advisers to resign in despair. ""If even they can't defend his conduct in office, how can anyone believe he is fit to govern?"" Liberal Democrat chief whip Wendy Chamberlain said: ""When both of Boris Johnson's own ethics advisers have quit, it is obvious that he is the one who needs to go."" Born in 1961, Christopher Geidt is a former army intelligence officer who later worked as a diplomat in Sarajevo, Brussels and Geneva In 2002, he began working for the Royal Household and served as the Queen's private secretary for 10 years from 2007 He stepped down after a ""power struggle"" between Buckingham Palace and the Prince of Wales, the Times reported in 2017 Lord Geidt is chairman of King's College London and also chairs a board of the investment firm Schroders He lives on the Isle of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides, where he grew up and where he now has a sheep farm. He is married with two daughters Former cabinet secretary Lord Turnbull said of Mr Johnson: ""The pattern of behaviour is that anyone who has the power to criticise, obstruct or force him to change, he will try to reduce their power, suborn them or in the last resort wave them aside.""

"Headingley - Yorkshire's home ground - will host next week's third Test between England and New Zealand Charges have been brought against ""a number of individuals"" by English cricket's governing body in relation to allegations of racism at Yorkshire. The accused, who have not been named, could be banned or fined by the England and Wales Cricket Board. Yorkshire itself has also been charged with breaching the anti-racism rules. Details of abuse first surfaced in September 2020 when former player Azeem Rafiq said discrimination left him feeling suicidal. ""In matters of this nature, our normal practice is not to identify individuals charged at this stage,"" said the ECB. Yorkshire said the ""allegations relate to charges as far back as 2004 up until 2021"". In a statement, the County added: ""The club will need the cooperation of those in position during this time in order to fully consider and respond to the matters raised."" Since Rafiq's accusations became public, 16 members of staff have left Yorkshire in a widespread overhaul of its senior leadership. The ECB said it had carried out a ""thorough and complex"" investigation to establish the grounds for the charges against both the county and the individuals involved. It said the charges arose from alleged breaches of a directive regarding ""conduct which is improper or which may be prejudicial to the interests of cricket or which may bring the ECB, the game of cricket or any cricketer into disrepute"" and its anti-discrimination code. The governing body expects hearings to take place in September or October and for the outcome of each case to be published after decisions are reached. ""It is standard practice for the cricket discipline commission disciplinary panel to publish its decisions and written reasons in full following the hearing,"" the ECB added. Rafiq played for Yorkshire across two spells totalling eight years ""I welcome today's announcement by the ECB and hope we can move to the hearing quickly,"" said Rafiq. ""This has been another gruelling but unfortunately necessary process. It has been a long two years since I went public about my experiences, but I hope this all means that no young player ever goes through such pain and alienation again. ""My preference would be for this hearing to take place publicly, but I am hopeful that we are at least nearing a point where there will be some sense of closure for my family and me."" BBC Sport understands Rafiq is himself likely to be charged at a later date over historical anti-Semitic posts on social media. Rafiqapologised and said he was ""deeply ashamed""for using the language in Facebook messages in 2011, which emerged after his appearance in front of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee. Rafiq gave an interview to ESPN Cricinfo in September 2020 alleging ""institutional racism"" at Yorkshire had left him close to taking his own life. Yorkshire launched ""a formal investigation"" in response and, a year later, an independent panel upheld seven of the 43 allegations made by Rafiq. However the panel's report was not published and no player, employee or executive faced disciplinary action as a result of its findings. The outcome sparked widespread criticism and in November 2021 the ECB suspended Yorkshire from hosting international matches at Headingley ""until it has clearly demonstrated that it can meet the standards expected"". Club chairman Roger Hutton stepped down, as did chief executive Mark Arthur. When approached by BBC Sport, the ECB declined to name any individuals charged. Former Yorkshire and England captain Michael Vaughan, who works as a pundit for BBC Sport and others,revealed he had been accused of making racist comments to Rafiq and others players,but has repeatedly denied the claims. Vaughan told the BBC he never made racist comments while at the county. He admitted regret at some tweets he had sent in the past. Later in November, Rafiq gave details of the racist abuse he suffered to a committee of MPs, claiming captain Gary Ballance and bowler Jack Brooks had used racist nicknames for team-mates. Ballance admitted using racist language,adding that he ""deeply regretted"" doing so. This video can not be played Nov 2021: Ex-England captain Michael Vaughan speaks to BBC Breakfast's Dan Walker Rafiq also mentioned the attitudes of Tim Bresnan, Andrew Gale and Matthew Hoggard towards him at the club. Bresnan has denied ""frequently making racist comments"",saying it is ""absolutely not true."" The ECB has not named those charged. Rafiq's testimony has been backed by others. Ex-Pakistan seamer Rana Naved-ul-Hasan saidhe had encountered the same prejudiceduring his two stints with the county while former Yorkshire academy playersIrfan AmjadandTabassum Bhattihave also shared their experiences of racism. England bowler Adil Rashid said he, like Rana Naved and Rafiq,had heard Vaughan make a racist comment. In December, head coach Gale and director of cricket Martyn Moxon wereamong 16 people to leave the club. Gale won a claim for unfair dismissal- alongside second-team coach Ian Dews, bowling coach Rich Pyrah, academy lead Richard Damms and strength and conditioning coaches Ian Fisher and Peter Sim. The ECB announceda wide-ranging review into racism in the sportandappointed a Muslim inclusion advisory body to help their reforms on Tuesday. Headingley returned to the international fixture list in March after members voted through reforms to the county's leadership structure. It will host the third and final Test against New Zealand next week.

"Manesh Gill lured the woman to a hotel bedroom then attacked her A doctor who raped a student nurse after contacting her through a dating app has been jailed for four years. Manesh Gill, 39, lured the woman to a hotel room in Stirling in December 2018 and attacked her. A judge at the High Court in Edinburgh told Gill the woman described their encounter as ""distressing and frightening"". The married father-of-three, who worked as a GP in Edinburgh, was convicted after a trial earlier this year. At his sentencing, judge Lord Tyre told Gill: ""You have no criminal record and you have clearly been a valued member of the medical profession."" But the judge said he was in ""no doubt"" that the gravity of the offence could only be marked by a custodial sentence. He told Gill that he would be placed on the sex offenders register indefinitely. Check out the latest headlines from Scotland,external Read more stories from Edinburgh,external The court earlier heard that Gill and his victim met after connecting on dating app Tinder. Gill called himself ""Mike"" and he ""superliked"" the young woman's profile, before they spent six weeks messaging each other on Snapchat. When they met in a hotel, Gill got her to go to his room to use the toilet and poured a ""really strong"" pink gin and lemonade before she was attacked. During evidence at Gill's earlier trial, the woman fought back tears as she described how her body ""shut down"" as she was sexually assaulted. She told prosecutor Stephanie Ross: ""He was on top of me. I was trying to push him off. I couldn't. ""I just felt like my whole body was stuck to the bed. He was having sex with me. I wanted to go home. I felt as if I couldn't move. I couldn't do anything,"" she said. She said she told Gill ""no"" and ""stop it"" during the attack. She eventually managed to get up and went to the bathroom. She said: ""I came out of the bathroom and said 'I know what you've been doing to me'."" She left the hotel and contacted police. Gill, of Corstorphine, in Edinburgh, admitted that he brought a condom, Viagra and a bottle of the woman's favourite drink - pink gin - to the hotel. But he denied raping the woman, claiming the sex was consensual. Gill said: ""I'm a married man with a professional job and I was meeting women on dates. I didn't want it connected with my job or my wife."" He was unanimously convicted of the sex crime committed when the victim was incapable of giving or withholding consent. Defence solicitor advocate Iain McSporran said Gill maintained his denial of the offence. He said Gill was ""greatly respected and valued"" as a GP. Det Insp Forbes Wilson, of Police Scotland's Public Protection Unit, said:  ""Gill must now face the consequences for his horrific behaviour.

"The pound's weakness against the dollar and the euro spells bad news for British holidaymakers this summer. Fears over the UK economy are weighing on markets, causing sterling to sink below $1.20 on Tuesday, its lowest level since the start of the pandemic, before partly recovering on Wednesday. Versus the euro, the pound is hovering near thirteen-month lows. As a result many Brits travelling in the next few weeks will find their spending money won't stretch as far. ""The pound remains a very vulnerable currency,"" said Jane Foley, head of foreign exchange strategy at the Dutch bank Rabobank. ""A lot of this is related to fears about growth,"" she continued, noting that political uncertainty and a potential trade conflict with the European Union were likely to add to investors' concerns about the UK's economic outlook. Fears for UK economy grow as higher prices bite Warning UK to see slowest growth of developed nations Why are prices rising so quickly? The weakness of the pound will ""add to the gloom"" for British holidaymakers, who are already facing the prospect of travel disruption, said Ms Foley. After more than two years of Covid restrictions, many people are planning their first trips overseas, with the peak summer holiday season and the long school break hovering on the horizon. But when they get there, they could find the pound in their pocket doesn't go as far, Ms Foley warned. ""If you're going to the Eurozone or the United States, you're going to be able to purchase less,"" she said. ""When we look at the dollar, it's very strong, so holidaymakers going to the US are really going to see the weakness."" Some holidaymakers will already have adjusted for this, however. ""Sterling's been on the backfoot for several years, so to some extent this weakness is already expected,"" Ms Foley said. Are UK travellers heading for a summer of misery? Fears have grown over the prospects for the UK economy afterfigures showed it shrank again in Aprilfor the second month in a row, with businesses feeling the impact of rising prices. There is uncertainty over how fast the Bank of England - which is expected to raise interest rates again on Thursday - can tighten policy this year to tame inflation without further hurting the economy further. However the pound's weakness is also a result of a strong dollar, Ms Foley said, with rising interest rates there making the US currency more attractive. ""A more aggressive pace of US interest rate hikes is certainly propping up the dollar,"" she said. The US central bank, the Federal Reserve, is expected to raise rates substantially after its policy meeting on Wednesday, to try to curb rising inflation there. ""Also, the dollar does have this safe haven appeal, so when we're looking at concerns perhaps about China, perhaps about the gas crisis in Europe, a large part of this does create an environment where people want to hold dollars.""

"This video can not be played Wayne Humphreys' fine and costs for passing this cyclist too closely were more than Â£1,800 A motorist has been ordered to pay more than Â£1,800 after passing a cyclist too closely. Wayne Humphreys, 77, was fined and given four penalty points for failing to leave enough space in his Audi Q8. Road safety partnership GoSafe said the outcome showed that these submissions are taken seriously and given the appropriate amount of attention. Mr Humphreys had refused to attend a course or pay a fixed penalty notice, but said the fine was ""appalling"". GoSafe said Mr Humphreys had been offered a place on a driver awareness course as an alternative to prosecution after it received footage of the incident. The cyclist recorded the close pass on a GoPro camera and reported the incident to roads policing teams. GoSafe added that Mr Humphreys, of Pontyclun, Rhondda Cynon Taf, also later failed to comply with a fixed penalty notice, resulting in the prosecution on 8 June, when he was fined Â£1,152 and ordered to pay Â£620 costs and a Â£115 victim surcharge. The warehouse boss was then prosecuted at Cardiff Magistrates' Court for driving without due care and attention and ordered to pay Â£1,887 in a fine and costs, and received four points on his licence. Mr Humphreys, said: ""The fine is absolutely appalling. I am 77 years of age and the last fine I had was 35 to 40 years ago. ""Other than that I have never had a fine and I have had a licence for 60 years."" Will the Highway Code revamp improve road safety? Cyclist confronts driver over 'disgusting' comments Bike passing distance signs a 'UK first' Following the narrow miss along the B4280 Pant Hirwaun outside Heol-y-Cyw, near Bridgend in September 2021, Mr Humphreys said he and his son later measured the road and claimed the gap he left for the cyclist was sufficient and safe. He said: ""Taking into account the cyclist and his bike, there would have still been at least 4ft (1.2m) space."" Motorists must now leave a 1.5m (5ft) gap when overtaking cyclists, as well as slowing down. The gap must be 2m (6.5ft) when passing pedestrians or horse riders. Changes in the language of The Highway Codecame in to force from 29 January,externalmean a driver is now more likely to be penalised for putting other road users in harm's way - especially if caught on camera. New laws came into force in January ""I find it absolutely incredible this has happened. I don't know whether to appeal it or not. It will probably just cost me more money. ""This has already cost me about Â£4,500 with the money for the court and the solicitor. It doesn't make sense to me."" This video can not be played What's changed in the Highway Code?

"Microsoft is finally retiring the consumer version of Internet Explorer. It announced the plan last year, making Internet Explorer 11 its final version. Internet Explorer debuted on Windows desktop computers in 1995 and by 2004, had cornered 95% of the market. But now, Google Chrome, Apple's Safari and Mozilla Firefox are dominant. Users wanting to stick with Microsoft are being directed to Microsoft Edge, launched in 2015, alongside Windows 10. Internet Explorer's popularity was dented by the launch of faster browsers such as Chrome and Firefox, as users seized on new applications to navigate platforms including Google Search, Facebook and YouTube.

"The head of the Federal Reserve is under pressure as price rises accelerate The US central bank has announced its biggest interest rate rise in nearly 30 years as it ramps up its fight to rein in soaring consumer prices. The Federal Reserve said it would increase its key interest rate by three quarters of a percentage point to a range of 1.5% to 1.75%. The rise, the third since March, comes after inflation in the US surged unexpectedly last month. More hikes are expected, adding to the uncertainty facing the economy. Forecasts released after the meeting showed officials expect the rate the Fed charges banks to borrow could reach 3.4% by the end of the year, the moves rippling out to the public in the form of higher borrowing costs for mortgages, credit cards and other loans. As central banks around the world take similar steps, it marks a massive change for the global economy, where businesses and households have enjoyed years of low borrowing costs. Eurozone plans first interest rate rise in 11 years How high could interest rates go? Why is inflation in the US so high? ""Most advanced economy central banks and some emerging market central banks are tightening policy in sync,"" said Gregory Daco, chief economist at strategy consulting firm EY-Parthenon. ""That is a global environment that we've not been accustomed to in the past few decades, and that will represent ramifications for the business sector and for consumers throughout the world."" In the UK, where consumer prices jumped 9% in April, the Bank of England is expected to announce its fifth rate rise since December on Thursday, pushing its benchmark rate above 1% for the first time since 2009. Brazil, Canada and Australia have also raised rates, while the European Central Bank has outlined plans to do so later this summer. The housing sector is feeling the impact of higher rates In the US, which slashed rates to support the economy when the pandemic hit in 2020, the Fed has already raised rates twice this year, by 0.25 percentage points in March and another half point in May. At the time, Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell said officials were not considering sharper rises. But figures on Friday, which showed US inflation rising to 8.6% in May - the fastest pace since 1981 - pushed officials to move more aggressively, Mr Powell said at a press conference following this week's meeting. ""It is essential that we bring inflation down,"" he said, acknowledging that a 0.75 percentage point rise was ""unusually large"". ""Inflation has obviously surprised to the upside over the past year and further surprises could be in store,"" he said. ""We therefore will need to be nimble."" Playing catch up Many analysts say the Fed is struggling to catch up, after Mr Powell and others last year dismissed price rises as a temporary problem related to supply chain issues. Since then, inflation has sharpened due to factors like the war in Ukraine and ongoing Covid-19 shutdowns in China. Recent surveys suggest the public expects the problem will continue to worsen, despite the Fed's vows to act. ""The Fed is under the gun and facing an inflation credibility test,"" said economist David Beckworth, senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. Ignacio Lopez isn't convinced the Fed's moves will successfully contain price increases affecting his business Ignacio Lopez is eager to see inflation brought under control. For the last 18 months, the Boston-based chef has been watching food prices climb as he stocks up for his restaurant. Prices for items with complicated supply chains, like packaged goods and imported cheese, are particularly under pressure, he says. ""It's crazy and it doesn't stop,"" he says. ""Every week things go up."" The business has raised its own prices to offset the costs, but he says he can't go too far without losing customers. So his profits are still taking a hit. He is worried that the rate increases won't help, noting that demand remains weak due to Covid, which has cut into the after-work gatherings that used to drive his business. ""We're just going to keep managing it as tight as we can, trying not to increase our prices beyond our market and hope things calm down,"" he says. The last time the Fed announced a rate hike of this size was 1994. The move, which makes borrowing more expensive, is expected to cool demand and slow economic activity - in theory, easing price pressures. But by acting late, and now moving more aggressively to compensate, policymakers face a greater chance that their actions will induce an economic downturn, Mr Daco said. ""I'm increasingly worried,"" he added. ""I wouldn't be surprised that around the turn of the year we face an environment where growth is stalling and we're pretty close to a recessionary environment, with the unemployment rate on the rise and no longer declining."" Higher food prices are one of the factors driving up inflation Mr Powell said the US is well poised to handle higher rates, pointing to still robust job growth. But projections released by the Fed show officials expect economic growth to slow to about 1.7% this year, a full percentage point lower than they forecast in March. Unemployment, now at 3.6%, is expected to rise to 3.7% and reach 4.1% by 2024. Officials also removed a line from their end of meeting statement - which typically shows little change - saying the labour market would remain strong as the Fed raised rates. Mr Powell said the omission reflected the fact that many forces driving inflation - like the war in Ukraine - are out of the bank's control. ""So much of it is really not down to monetary policy,"" he said. ""That just didn't seem appropriate anymore so we took it out."" With Wednesday's rise, the rate the Fed charges banks to borrow will return to where it was before the pandemic hit in 2020, remaining relatively low by historic standards. But the increases are already having an impact. The average petrol price in the US has hit $5 a gallon, creating a political problem for President Joe Biden Higher rates have helped to boost demand for dollars, sending the currency up 10% since the start of the year and putting other countries, especially emerging markets with large amounts of debt in dollars, under pressure. People in Pakistan urged to drink fewer cups of tea Weak pound puts the squeeze on holiday spending In the US, financial markets have slipped, with the S&P 500, which tracks hundreds of America's biggest companies, losing a fifth of its value since the start of the year, as multinationals warn that inflation and the rise in the dollar is hurting their profits. Home sales have also slowed precipitously as mortgage rates follow the Fed rate higher. Data on Wednesday also showed retail sales slipped last month, as people spent more at the pump due to rising petrol costs and deferred purchases of big ticket items like cars. Mr Powell said gaining control of the price increases was essential to economic stability and progress would take time. ""At the end of the day, the outlook is very uncertain,"" Mr Beckworth said. ""The Fed has to be at some level, lucky."" When will interest rates fall? Why is inflation in the US so high?

"Headingley - Yorkshire's home ground - will host next week's third Test between England and New Zealand Charges have been brought against ""a number of individuals"" by English cricket's governing body in relation to allegations of racism at Yorkshire. The accused, who have not been named, could be banned or fined by the England and Wales Cricket Board. Yorkshire itself has also been charged with breaching the anti-racism rules. Details of abuse first surfaced in September 2020 when former player Azeem Rafiq said discrimination left him feeling suicidal. ""In matters of this nature, our normal practice is not to identify individuals charged at this stage,"" said the ECB. Yorkshire said the ""allegations relate to charges as far back as 2004 up until 2021"". In a statement, the County added: ""The club will need the cooperation of those in position during this time in order to fully consider and respond to the matters raised."" Since Rafiq's accusations became public, 16 members of staff have left Yorkshire in a widespread overhaul of its senior leadership. The ECB said it had carried out a ""thorough and complex"" investigation to establish the grounds for the charges against both the county and the individuals involved. It said the charges arose from alleged breaches of a directive regarding ""conduct which is improper or which may be prejudicial to the interests of cricket or which may bring the ECB, the game of cricket or any cricketer into disrepute"" and its anti-discrimination code. The governing body expects hearings to take place in September or October and for the outcome of each case to be published after decisions are reached. ""It is standard practice for the cricket discipline commission disciplinary panel to publish its decisions and written reasons in full following the hearing,"" the ECB added. Rafiq played for Yorkshire across two spells totalling eight years ""I welcome today's announcement by the ECB and hope we can move to the hearing quickly,"" said Rafiq. ""This has been another gruelling but unfortunately necessary process. It has been a long two years since I went public about my experiences, but I hope this all means that no young player ever goes through such pain and alienation again. ""My preference would be for this hearing to take place publicly, but I am hopeful that we are at least nearing a point where there will be some sense of closure for my family and me."" BBC Sport understands Rafiq is himself likely to be charged at a later date over historical anti-Semitic posts on social media. Rafiqapologised and said he was ""deeply ashamed""for using the language in Facebook messages in 2011, which emerged after his appearance in front of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee. Rafiq gave an interview to ESPN Cricinfo in September 2020 alleging ""institutional racism"" at Yorkshire had left him close to taking his own life. Yorkshire launched ""a formal investigation"" in response and, a year later, an independent panel upheld seven of the 43 allegations made by Rafiq. However the panel's report was not published and no player, employee or executive faced disciplinary action as a result of its findings. The outcome sparked widespread criticism and in November 2021 the ECB suspended Yorkshire from hosting international matches at Headingley ""until it has clearly demonstrated that it can meet the standards expected"". Club chairman Roger Hutton stepped down, as did chief executive Mark Arthur. When approached by BBC Sport, the ECB declined to name any individuals charged. Former Yorkshire and England captain Michael Vaughan, who works as a pundit for BBC Sport and others,revealed he had been accused of making racist comments to Rafiq and others players,but has repeatedly denied the claims. Vaughan told the BBC he never made racist comments while at the county. He admitted regret at some tweets he had sent in the past. Later in November, Rafiq gave details of the racist abuse he suffered to a committee of MPs, claiming captain Gary Ballance and bowler Jack Brooks had used racist nicknames for team-mates. Ballance admitted using racist language,adding that he ""deeply regretted"" doing so. This video can not be played Nov 2021: Ex-England captain Michael Vaughan speaks to BBC Breakfast's Dan Walker Rafiq also mentioned the attitudes of Tim Bresnan, Andrew Gale and Matthew Hoggard towards him at the club. Bresnan has denied ""frequently making racist comments"",saying it is ""absolutely not true."" The ECB has not named those charged. Rafiq's testimony has been backed by others. Ex-Pakistan seamer Rana Naved-ul-Hasan saidhe had encountered the same prejudiceduring his two stints with the county while former Yorkshire academy playersIrfan AmjadandTabassum Bhattihave also shared their experiences of racism. England bowler Adil Rashid said he, like Rana Naved and Rafiq,had heard Vaughan make a racist comment. In December, head coach Gale and director of cricket Martyn Moxon wereamong 16 people to leave the club. Gale won a claim for unfair dismissal- alongside second-team coach Ian Dews, bowling coach Rich Pyrah, academy lead Richard Damms and strength and conditioning coaches Ian Fisher and Peter Sim. The ECB announceda wide-ranging review into racism in the sportandappointed a Muslim inclusion advisory body to help their reforms on Tuesday. Headingley returned to the international fixture list in March after members voted through reforms to the county's leadership structure. It will host the third and final Test against New Zealand next week.

"Petrol prices have hit new record highs every day for the past month, according to motoring organisation the RAC. The cost to fill a family car now stands at about Â£103 for petrol, and Â£106 for diesel, it said. The war in Ukraine and moves to reduce dependence on Russian oil have helped drive up fuel prices, putting households under pressure as food and energy bills also soar. The average petrol price is now 186.59p per litre, with diesel at 192.48p. The RAC called on the government to cut fuel taxes to ease the cost burden on motorists, and to help lower the cost of living. ""New records in the average price of petrol have been set every day for the last month, with a litre rising 21p, which has added more than Â£11 to a tank,"" said RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams. He said that RAC analysis of wholesale diesel prices indicates that diesel could hit ""a previously unthinkable average of Â£2 a litre"", and that ""unfortunately, it has already crossed this threshold at motorway services"". However, rival motoring organisation the AA said wholesale fuel costs had been steady recently, while pump prices had been rising. ""Another penny on petrol is a surprise given that wholesale costs have been level if not lower since the Jubilee,"" said Luke Bosdet, the AA's spokesman on fuel prices. He said if petrol continues to go up at the same rate heading into the weekend, ""the government has yet another reason to call the retailers out"". He said that diesel may yet hit Â£2 per litre, but ""why invite the fuel trade to speed up the pump price rises?"" ""It's a volatile market, nothing is guaranteed until it happens,"" he added.

The Treasury cut the tax in March by 5p per litre in a bid to help motorists, and has asked the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to investigate whether that cut is being passed on to motorists quickly enough. The RAC called on the government to temporarily lower VAT on fuel, and make a further cut in fuel duty, saying the rise in VAT takings since March was now more than cancelling out the fuel duty cut. So far the government has ruled out cutting VAT, saying higher receipts from fuel price increases will be largely offset by lower receipts from household spending less on other goods and services. The government has put together a Â£37bn package to help families as energy, food and fuel bills soar. More than eight million UK homes on benefits are set to receive Â£326 by the end of July, with a second payment of Â£324 in the autumn.

"Bags of fake Wonka bars seized A haul of counterfeit chocolate bars has been seized in raids on American candy shops on Oxford Street. The ""Wonka Bars"" were confiscated on Tuesday by trading standards staff, who took merchandise worth about Â£100,000, according to Westminster Council. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) warned: ""If you have bought these knock-off bars, do not eat them."" The council has been targeting US-themed sweet shopsamid claims nearly Â£8m of business rates are owed. It says it has netted about Â£475,000 of counterfeit and illegal goods in the past six months. Council leader Adam Hug said: ""We need landlords to take responsibility about who they let to."" A mountain of counterfeit chocolate bars covered council leader Adam Hug's table ""The problem is that owners of buildings are turning a blind eye to those who sublet them as it means they are not liable for business rates,"" the new council leader said. ""This needs to stop and we will be stepping up pressure on landlords to make it clear they are responsible for Oxford Street being overrun with these kinds of stores."" The FSA has also issued a warning as it believes the chocolate is being produced or repackaged by unregistered businesses and individuals who could be bypassing food hygiene, labelling and traceability laws.

"Rail travel has been disrupted this week by industrial action, including an overtime ban which continues on Friday. Members of the train drivers' union Aslef walked out on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, prompting widespread cancellations. The six-day overtime ban, which started on Bank Holiday Monday and runs until Saturday, will continue to have an impact on some services. Drivers from 16 train operating companies staged walkouts on different days this week. The services affected included LNER, Northern Trains and TransPennine Express, c2c, Greater Anglia, Great Northern, Thameslink, Southeastern, Southern/Gatwick Express, South Western Railway main line and Island Line, Avanti West Coast, Chiltern Railways, CrossCountry, East Midlands Railway, Great Western Railway and West Midlands Trains. The overtime ban also means drivers have not been accepting any extra shifts, which they say are crucial to the smooth running of the rail network. National Rail said train timetables were likely to be affected. Passengers are advised tocheck before they travel.,external Rail passengers with advance tickets can get refunds if the train they are booked on is cancelled, delayed or rescheduled due to strikes.â¯â¯ If passengers have a return ticket they may also be entitled to a fee-free refund if part of the journey is cancelled. Season ticket holders (flexi, monthly or longer) who cannot travel, canclaim 100% compensation for strike dates,external. Aslef, the train drivers' union, is seeking better pay for its members. It says drivers are being asked to accept worse working conditions in exchange for a wage increase. Strike action began in July 2022 but no formal talks have taken place between the two sides since April 2023, when the most recent pay deal was rejected. The offer, described as ""risible"" by Aslef, included 4% pay rises two years in a row, on the condition drivers accepted changes to training and negotiated new work patterns. Train operators say ways of working need to change for wages to rise, because of the financial challenges they are facing and to ensure fairness to taxpayers. The body which negotiates on behalf of the rail companies, the Rail Delivery Group, says it continues to ""seek a fair agreement"". Unions need to re-ballot members every six months to see if they want to continue with industrial action. Currently, unions are obliged to give at least 14 days' notice of any strike action. In November last year, RMT members, including guards and ticket office staff,voted to accept a pay offer. This included a backdated pay rise of 5% for 2022-23 and job security guarantees. Talks over future pay deals and working practices will continue. A new law meanstrain companies can require enough staff to work on strike daysto run 40% of services. The Department for Transport said it expects employers to use minimum service levels ""if appropriate to do so, and to deliver the best possible service"". PM 'disappointed' as new rail strike law not used However, industry insiders told the BBC that applying the new rules was complicated. One source said it meant co-ordinating a reduced timetable with other operators in a short space of time. The Rail Delivery Group, a membership organisation of Britain's train operating companies, said the minimum services levels law was a potential tool but not a ""silver bullet"". Unions strongly oppose it. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) says median pay for ""train and tram drivers"" is just under Â£59,000. Train companies and the government say the offer rejected by Aslef would take average train driver pay to Â£65,000. The average salary of rail workers in 2022 was Â£45,919,according to the ONS.,external If drivers are excluded (because they tend to be members of the Aslef union, not RMT) its estimate is Â£39,518. However, the RMT union said that figure was too high because it does not include rail cleaning staff. Will you be affected by the strikes?

"For travellers, the past fortnight has brought a tidal wave of bad news. Cancelled flights, proposed rail strikes and record-breaking petrol prices have thrown people's plans into disarray - and now the peak summer holiday season and the long school break are hovering on the horizon. After more than two years of Covid restrictions, this should be a summer of fun. But are we now heading into a summer of misery? We take a look at where things stand for planes and trains over the weeks ahead. The UK air travel industry has just faced what is arguably its biggest test since coronavirus rules were lifted and it is fair to say, it has been a bumpy ride. Over the Jubilee bank holiday, which coincided with many schools' half-term breaks, 750 flights out of the UK were cancelled, according to aviation data firm Cirium. Around 466 return flights were axed. Although cancellations made up a small percentage of total flights, many passengers were only informed at short notice and faced long queues to check-in bags and get through security. Staff shortages from job cuts made at the height of the pandemic have been driving cancellations and delays, heightening holidaymakers' anxiety that problems will continue into the key summer season. Why are so many flights being cancelled? What are my rights if my flight is cancelled? Add to that the threat of strike action. British Airways workers have voted in favour of supporting industrial action, in a ballot conducted by the Unite union, while Ryanair is facing walkouts by staff in parts of Europe. Jess Baker has been put off travelling abroad this summer after a recent ""nightmare"" 18-hour journey home from Iceland. She, her husband Shaun and their two children had their EasyJet flight into Luton cancelled on Monday. They were given the option to travel home on Thursday but needed to get back sooner so paid Â£1,000 to fly into Glasgow with Icelandair. They shelled out an additional Â£340 to hire a car to drive down to Luton to collect their own vehicle. Jess Baker and her family had their EasyJet flight cancelled from Iceland to Luton ""It's been an absolute nightmare,"" says Ms Baker. ""We quickly decided that we'll go camping here instead. It's not worth the hassle all over again."" Others may have the same idea. Sykes Holiday Cottages says it has seen a 22% rise in bookings in the past two weeks compared to the same period last year. Chief executive Graham Donoghue says it is ""at least in part due to widespread reports of overseas travel disruption"". ""Travellers simply don't want to have to tackle airports and take the risk that their family holidays could be cancelled,"" he says. Since cutting staff, airlines, airports and the companies that provide baggage handling have been recruiting but because new workers have to pass security checks, it takes time. Heathrow airport's boss John Holland-Kayerecently told the Financial Times,externalit could take up to 18 months for the aviation sector to ""fully recover capacity"". Aviation consultant Chris Tarry tells the BBC the situation should improve as more staff are security cleared, but he warns there are ""unlikely to be enough workers in certain areas given wages and working conditions"". And airports ""only work if all of the elements are in place"", he says. Glastonbury Festival returns this year on 22 June, but it might not be that easy to get there now rail strikes have been announced. More than 40,000 RMT Union members from Network Rail and 13 train operators are set to walk out after talks over pay and redundancies broke down. The strikes are due to take place on 21, 23 and 25 June but it is likely services across the whole week will be disrupted. Train drivers are also going to hold their own strikes over pay. Passengers have been advised not to travel on trainsunless necessary during the strikes. Zahid Fayyaz, a solicitor from Brixton who is planning to travel to Glastonbury by train, is worried about the impact the potential strikes might have. Zahid Fayyaz is having to change his travel plans to get to Glastonbury Festival He originally had a ticket for 23 June but because of the planned strike on that day he and his two friends have bought new tickets to travel the day before. It cost them Â£240 and an extra day off work. ""It's going to take an extra two hours, but aside from this I'll be fine. But other people won't be able to take time off work or afford the extra money,"" the 40-year-old says. Railway workers to strike over three days in June When is the rail strike and which lines will be affected? Unions branded selfish by No 10 over rail strikes Mr Fayyaz says he is broadly sympathetic to the rail workers striking, but believes the ""timing is wrong"". Glastonbury Festival is one of several events impacted by potential travel disruption, along with a cricket test match between England and New Zealand in Leeds.  Glastonbury22-26 Third TestHeadingley 23-27 Ed SheeranWembley 25 Some people are switching their mode of transport to buses and coaches. Chris Hardy, managing director of National Express, said the firm had seen an increase in enquiries and bookings during the days of the rail strikes. The walkout could yet be called off if all parties can reach an agreement. That's what John Kuehne, from Fort Lauderdale in Florida, is hoping for. John Kuehne, a Yes fan from Florida, faces rail disruption during his trip to the UK He's traveling to England along with many of his friends from around the world to see prog-rock legends Yes, who are performing at London's Royal Albert Hall on 21 June. But ""everything is up in the air"" now, he says. ""Car rentals, parking, fuel, tolls, and congestion zone fees make it very expensive and inconvenient."" Mr Kuehne also happens to be arriving in the UK just as the cost of filling an average family car hit Â£100 for the first time. He says labour disputes happen but that ""all sides need to come together quickly to find a reasonable solution"".

"The PM's ethics adviser has quit a day after saying there was a ""legitimate question"" about whether Boris Johnson broke ministerial rules over Partygate. Lord Geidt did not give a reason for leaving the role he took in 2021, but said it was the ""right thing"" to do. His predecessor, Sir Alex Allan, quit in 2020 after Mr Johnson overruled him over a report into alleged bullying by Home Secretary Priti Patel. The government said it was ""surprised"" by Lord Geidt's decision. ""Whilst we are disappointed, we thank Lord Geidt for his public service,"" a spokesperson added. The spokesperson gave no reason for the resignation but said Lord Geidt had been asked this week ""to provide advice on a commercially sensitive matter in the national interest, which has previously had cross-party support. No decision had been taken pending that advice"". No 10 did not make it clear what these comments referred to. Justice Secretary Dominic Raab said there were ""questions around the detail of the resignation"" and said No 10 would provide an update later on Thursday. He added that Lord Geidt had had a ""pretty rough grilling by MPs this week"" and that media an politicians ""maybe underestimate how civil servants feel with that kind of scrutiny"". Explain why Partygate did not breach code, PM told PM's Partygate fine may have broken code, MPs told Boris Johnson appoints new ministerial standards adviser A Downing Street source told the BBC that Lord Geidt's resignation had been a ""total surprise and a mystery"" to the prime minister, adding: ""Only on Monday Lord Geidt asked if he could stay on for six months."" Labour's Chris Bryant, chairman of the Commons' Committee on Standards and Privileges, told Radio 4's Today that Lord Geidt's resignation letter should be published, adding: ""I hope the Cabinet Office will publish that letter today,"" Sir Philip Mawer, a former parliamentary commissioner for standards, echoed these calls and said: ""If the letter and the prime minister's reply are not published then I think people will draw their own conclusion and it will not be favourable."" He said he had been ""disappointed but not surprised"" at Lord Geidt's resignation, adding there had been a ""succession of failures"" on the part of the prime minister and ""it's not just Partygate"". Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner said: ""The prime minister has now driven both of his own handpicked ethics advisers to resign in despair. ""If even they can't defend his conduct in office, how can anyone believe he is fit to govern?"" Liberal Democrat chief whip Wendy Chamberlain said: ""When both of Boris Johnson's own ethics advisers have quit, it is obvious that he is the one who needs to go."" Born in 1961, Christopher Geidt is a former army intelligence officer who later worked as a diplomat in Sarajevo, Brussels and Geneva In 2002, he began working for the Royal Household and served as the Queen's private secretary for 10 years from 2007 He stepped down after a ""power struggle"" between Buckingham Palace and the Prince of Wales, the Times reported in 2017 Lord Geidt is chairman of King's College London and also chairs a board of the investment firm Schroders He lives on the Isle of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides, where he grew up and where he now has a sheep farm. He is married with two daughters Former cabinet secretary Lord Turnbull said of Mr Johnson: ""The pattern of behaviour is that anyone who has the power to criticise, obstruct or force him to change, he will try to reduce their power, suborn them or in the last resort wave them aside."" But he told BBC Newsnight that ""the charge sheet of Boris Johnson's conduct is now so long that one accusation isn't going to make any difference"", adding the prime minister would only leave office if he was removed as Tory leader by MPs. It was reported that Lord Geidt had threatened to quit last month after the publication of the Sue Gray report into lockdown breaches in Downing Street unless Mr Johnson issued a public explanation for his conduct. Appearing before a committee of MPs on Tuesday, Lord Geidt said: ""Resignation is one of the rather blunt but few tools available to the adviser. I am glad that my frustrations were addressed in the way that they were."" But, in a brief written statement,externalon Wednesday, he said: ""With regret, I feel that it is right that I am resigning from my post as independent adviser on ministers' interests."" On Wednesday evening, Lord Geidt phoned the prime minister's principal private secretary to tell him he was resigning. Mr Johnson was informed of the decision at about 18:30 BST, shortly after finishing a phone call with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky. But while the particular timing has surprised some in Downing Street, Lord Geidt's discomfort in the job has been evident for a while. Just last month he had said in a report that it was a legitimate question to ask if Boris Johnson had breached the ministerial code by breaking Covid laws. Lord Geidt also spelled out in the report that he didn't like the terms of his job - ""the prevailing arrangements still remained insufficiently independent to be able to command the confidence of the public"" as he put it. But the truth is we don't yet know definitively why Lord Geidt resigned, as his resignation letter has not been published - which itself is unconventional. The prime minister is expected to write back to Lord Geidt on Thursday morning, and that reply may well be made public. Read Chris's full analysis Mr Johnson was fined in April over a surprise birthday party in his honour that he attended in Downing Street in June 2020. Writing to Lord Geidt afterwards, he said there had been ""no intent"" to break Covid regulations"", and that he had been ""fully accountable to Parliament and the British people"". The ministerial code, which outlines the rules government ministers must follow, says there is an ""overarching duty"" on them to comply with the law. If the code is broken, the convention in Westminster is for a minister to resign. In his annual report on ministers' interests, published on 1 June, Lord Geidt said questions around Mr Johnson's behaviour had led to an ""impression... the prime minister may be unwilling to have his own conduct judged against"" the ministerial code. He said that, when it came to the Partygate fine, ""a legitimate question has arisen as to whether those facts alone might have constituted a breach of the overarching duty within the ministerial code of complying with the law"". Following Lord Geidt's resignation, Tory MP William Wragg, whose Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee questioned the adviser on Tuesday, described him as ""a person of great integrity, motivated by the highest ideals of public service"". Mr Wragg, a critic of Mr Johnson, added: ""For the PM to lose one adviser on ministers' interests may be regarded as a misfortune. To lose two looks like carelessness.""

"The UK government says the Northern Ireland Protocol has disrupted trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain The EU has announced new legal action against the UK government over its plans to scrap parts of the post-Brexit deal for Northern Ireland. Ministers outlined a bill on Monday aimed at unilaterally changing trade, tax and governance arrangements in the 2019 deal. The treaty was agreed by both sides but the UK says it has disrupted trade and power-sharing in Northern Ireland. But the EU says overriding parts of the deal would break international law. European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic said there was ""no legal or political justification whatsoever for unilaterally changing an international agreement"". ""So let's call a spade a spade, this is illegal,"" Mr Sefcovic said, adding that the UK's decision ""left us with no choice"" but to take legal action. Prime Minister Boris Johnson's spokesperson said his government was disappointed the EU had taken legal action and continued to favour a negotiated resolution. UK reveals plans to ditch parts of EU Brexit deal What is the Northern Ireland Protocol row about? Brexit and Northern Ireland: What does each side want? The Northern Ireland Protocol is a special arrangement that keeps Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods, avoiding a hard border with the Republic of Ireland. The arrangement ensured free trade could continue across the Irish land border, which is a sensitive issue because of the history of conflict in Northern Ireland. But the protocol brought in some new checks on goods moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and has been criticised by unionist politicians. However, the majority of politicians elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly in last month's elections support the arrangements. The European Commission said,externalit would restart legal action - paused in March 2021 - over the UK's decision to delay checks on certain goods arriving into Northern Ireland from Great Britain. The Commission also launched two new proceedings over claims the UK has failed in its obligations to share trade data and set up border inspection posts. These legal steps could eventually lead to the UK being fined under a dispute process overseen by the European Court of Justice (ECJ). But the dispute process can take months to complete and the Commission has insisted its ""door remains open"" for talks with the UK to find a resolution. The launch of legal action by the EU may sound dramatic but this is a process stretching over many months. UK legislation, to scrap parts of the protocol, will likewise take some time with the bill set to face resistance in Parliament. Regardless, the stakes have been raised this week in a dispute that has been bogged down for months. But worth noting is the emphasis from the European Commission's Maros Sefcovic that his door is open; he's saying the EU wants to talk. However the fact remains that the two sides can't even agree on quite what they should talk about. Demands by Britain for changes on tax and governance are a non-starter for the EU. There's more common ground on customs and the hope in Brussels is that they can show progress is possible within the terms of the existing treaty. But the mood isn't optimistic with diplomats frequently suggesting they think the issue is mired in Tory party politics. And if nothing changes the slow-burn passage of legal action and legislation could eventually explode into an even bigger confrontation. But as officials are keen to stress, we're not there yet. The UK government says it would prefer to agree changes with the EU, rather than act alone to scrap parts of the protocol. The government justified its move under a legal principle called the ""doctrine of necessity"", insisting the protocol was causing ""peril"" to society and politics in Northern Ireland. The UK government's chief legal adviser, Suella Braverman, told the BBC the protocol was ""adversely and seriously affecting"" Northern Ireland. She said her preferred alternative was negotiation but accused the EU of failing to do that ""meaningfully for over two years now and that's why we've regrettably been left with no option but to take these measures"". How PM's views on Northern Ireland deal changed Europe is prepping for a trade war no-one wants Northern Ireland's power-sharing administration cannot be formed without the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which has refused to take part until reforms are made to the protocol. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has urged the DUP to ""get on with it"", but the party's leader, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, has said that would depend on whether the bill to change the protocol passed into law. Earlier Philippe Lamberts, a Belgium member of the European Parliament, told the BBC the protocol changes proposed by the UK were ""about political posturing"". He said patience in Brussels ""has been tested to the extreme by Boris Johnson"". In March 2021, the EU launched legal action against the UK for delaying the full implementation of checks on some goods, including argi-food products. The infringement proceedings were paused last year but have now been resumed by the EU. If the UK government does not reply within two months, the EU could take the matter to the ECJ, which has powers to impose penalties. The EU has also launched two new actions for further alleged breaches of the protocol. These relate to alleged UK failures to carry out its obligations under the EU's sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) rules and ""provide the EU with certain trade statistics data"". The actions do not directly relate to the UK's draft legislation, with the EU reserving the right to take further action if that law ever comes into effect. ""If this draft bill becomes law, of course I cannot exclude anything,"" Mr Sefcovic said. The EU also gave more detail,externalon its own proposals to ease checks which they say can resolve issues of concern in Northern Ireland. These include an expanded trusted trader arrangement covering more products and companies and a cut to customs administration. Mr Sefcovic said the proposals were ""all about simplification"" and at the news conference, attempted to demonstrate this by holding up three documents. ""These are the three pages that need to be filled. Not 300, not 30, three,"" he said. Echoing the UK prime minister's Brexit rhetoric, Mr Sefcovic said the proposals were ""oven-ready"", while adding this was not an ""unconditional offer"". Maros Sefcovic said the EU's proposals would simplify administration But the UK has previously rejected the EU's proposals saying they would make things worse, and if differences are not resolved, there are fears that the row over the protocol could trigger a trade war, which involves putting up barriers to the exchange of goods. A trade war could increase costs for consumers, possibly compounding pressure on household budgets driven by inflation at 40-year highs.

"UK service personnel working at the IDCC, Patch Barracks, Stuttgart, Germany The BBC has been allowed rare access to the military nerve centre where Western powers are coordinating efforts to supply weapons and ammunition to Ukraine. In the attic of an austere US military barracks in the German city of Stuttgart, dozens of military personnel from 26 nations are working round the clock to deliver weapons to Ukraine. From this room, Western allies have already helped deliver nearly $8bn (Â£6.6bn) worth of weapons and ammunition to Ukraine's armed forces. That's 66,000 tonnes - the equivalent of 5,000 London double-decker buses, as one British officer worked out. Most of what happens at Patch Barracks is highly classified. We are asked to leave all electronic devices behind and we are not allowed to film or talk to the Ukrainians who are part of the International Donors Coordination Cell (IDCC). Military personnel from dozens of countries bash the phones and pore over computer screens. They include a small team from Ukraine, led by a three-star general. At the start of each day he sets out what his country needs. The situation in the Donbas appears increasingly bleak, but here in Stuttgart there's more a sense of urgency than panic. US M777 Howitzers have arrived in Ukraine Around one set of desks a team is tasked with locating supplies. Sometimes they'll find a nation willing to provide weapons, but will then have to track another country for the right ammunition or the means to transport them. They've now developed a database where the Ukrainians can list their priorities. Donor nations can access that information and decide what they're willing and able to supply. Brig Chris King, the senior British officer, says that military aid is being delivered by air, road, rail and sea and to multiple locations ""in order to ensure we don't have any single points of failure"". He says that Russia has tried to step up its attacks on supply lines but there's been no ""significant"" interruption to their delivery. I ask if any supplies have been hit. ""Yes, I presume so,"" he replies. The task of moving the weapons and ammunition across the border is left to the Ukrainians themselves, says Rear Adm Duke Heinz, the senior US commander at the IDCC. ""In Poland and the other countries, the Ukrainians come and get it - so they're the ones who determine how it gets across the border."" Once the weapons cross the border, they can arrive at the front line ""within 48 hours"". Recently there have been alarming warnings from Ukraine that the flow of weapons is too little and too late. As Russia continues to bombard the Donbas, pleas for more help are sounding more desperate by the day. Ukraine's deputy defence minister says that, so far, the country has only received 10% of what it has asked for. Here in Stuttgart, Rear Adm Heinz gives a very different message: ""I am confident they are not going to run out of ammunition."" Despite the grim news from the Donbas, he says ""I wouldn't say they're losing, I'd say they're holding their own."" Ukraine's demands have changed significantly over the past few months. The IDCC was set up in late February - bringing together two separate efforts being led by the US and the UK. At the start of the war they were sending small arms and ammunition - such as anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles. Now Ukrainians are asking for heavier weapons - artillery, multiple rocket launchers and air defence systems. What weapons has the US given Ukraine? In the early days of the war the IDCC tried to source stocks of old Soviet weapons and ammunition from former Soviet bloc countries - the same systems Ukraine's armed forces had been using for decades. Brig King says those supplies have slowly been running out. There is now just one factory in Europe that produces Soviet-compatible 152mm artillery ammunition. Slowly, they have been transitioning to Nato-standard equipment. Over the past few months Ukraine has been sent more than 100 M777 US howitzers and 300,000 rounds of 155mm ammunition. This brings an additional challenge, as Ukrainian forces need to be trained in how to use the weapons and ammunition. The IDCC is organising that training outside Ukraine. Some Ukrainian troops are now being trained in the UK on new artillery guns and British-supplied multiple rocket launchers. Simpler systems can be taught virtually, using videos and training manuals. Neither Rear Adm Heinz nor Brig King believe this war will be over quickly. They both say they're preparing to carry on this work for the long term. When I ask the brigadier for how long, he replies, ""It's not going to be months, I think we'll be here for a number of years."" But there are some within Nato who question whether the West is really geared up for a war that could go on for years. It could certainly test its unity, resolve and limited stocks of weapons and ammunition. In Stuttgart they know the stakes couldn't be higher. Rear Adm Heinz describes the mission of providing Ukraine with weapons and ammunition as ""the most important work this command has done"" since US EUCOM (European Command) was set up in 1952. Brig King calls it ""a generational moment"" and says the choice is stark: ""We either help Ukraine to fight or we accept that, maybe not straight away but in the next few years, we're going to be fighting somewhere else. If we don't do enough we will sow the seeds for future conflict.""

"The UK government says the Northern Ireland Protocol has disrupted trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain The EU has announced new legal action against the UK government over its plans to scrap parts of the post-Brexit deal for Northern Ireland. Ministers outlined a bill on Monday aimed at unilaterally changing trade, tax and governance arrangements in the 2019 deal. The treaty was agreed by both sides but the UK says it has disrupted trade and power-sharing in Northern Ireland. But the EU says overriding parts of the deal would break international law. European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic said there was ""no legal or political justification whatsoever for unilaterally changing an international agreement"". ""So let's call a spade a spade, this is illegal,"" Mr Sefcovic said, adding that the UK's decision ""left us with no choice"" but to take legal action. Prime Minister Boris Johnson's spokesperson said his government was disappointed the EU had taken legal action and continued to favour a negotiated resolution. UK reveals plans to ditch parts of EU Brexit deal What is the Northern Ireland Protocol row about? Brexit and Northern Ireland: What does each side want? The Northern Ireland Protocol is a special arrangement that keeps Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods, avoiding a hard border with the Republic of Ireland. The arrangement ensured free trade could continue across the Irish land border, which is a sensitive issue because of the history of conflict in Northern Ireland. But the protocol brought in some new checks on goods moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and has been criticised by unionist politicians. However, the majority of politicians elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly in last month's elections support the arrangements. The European Commission said,externalit would restart legal action - paused in March 2021 - over the UK's decision to delay checks on certain goods arriving into Northern Ireland from Great Britain. The Commission also launched two new proceedings over claims the UK has failed in its obligations to share trade data and set up border inspection posts. These legal steps could eventually lead to the UK being fined under a dispute process overseen by the European Court of Justice (ECJ). But the dispute process can take months to complete and the Commission has insisted its ""door remains open"" for talks with the UK to find a resolution. The launch of legal action by the EU may sound dramatic but this is a process stretching over many months. UK legislation, to scrap parts of the protocol, will likewise take some time with the bill set to face resistance in Parliament. Regardless, the stakes have been raised this week in a dispute that has been bogged down for months. But worth noting is the emphasis from the European Commission's Maros Sefcovic that his door is open; he's saying the EU wants to talk. However the fact remains that the two sides can't even agree on quite what they should talk about. Demands by Britain for changes on tax and governance are a non-starter for the EU. There's more common ground on customs and the hope in Brussels is that they can show progress is possible within the terms of the existing treaty. But the mood isn't optimistic with diplomats frequently suggesting they think the issue is mired in Tory party politics. And if nothing changes the slow-burn passage of legal action and legislation could eventually explode into an even bigger confrontation. But as officials are keen to stress, we're not there yet. The UK government says it would prefer to agree changes with the EU, rather than act alone to scrap parts of the protocol. The government justified its move under a legal principle called the ""doctrine of necessity"", insisting the protocol was causing ""peril"" to society and politics in Northern Ireland. The UK government's chief legal adviser, Suella Braverman, told the BBC the protocol was ""adversely and seriously affecting"" Northern Ireland. She said her preferred alternative was negotiation but accused the EU of failing to do that ""meaningfully for over two years now and that's why we've regrettably been left with no option but to take these measures"". How PM's views on Northern Ireland deal changed Europe is prepping for a trade war no-one wants Northern Ireland's power-sharing administration cannot be formed without the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which has refused to take part until reforms are made to the protocol. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has urged the DUP to ""get on with it"", but the party's leader, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, has said that would depend on whether the bill to change the protocol passed into law. Earlier Philippe Lamberts, a Belgium member of the European Parliament, told the BBC the protocol changes proposed by the UK were ""about political posturing"". He said patience in Brussels ""has been tested to the extreme by Boris Johnson"". In March 2021, the EU launched legal action against the UK for delaying the full implementation of checks on some goods, including argi-food products. The infringement proceedings were paused last year but have now been resumed by the EU. If the UK government does not reply within two months, the EU could take the matter to the ECJ, which has powers to impose penalties. The EU has also launched two new actions for further alleged breaches of the protocol. These relate to alleged UK failures to carry out its obligations under the EU's sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) rules and ""provide the EU with certain trade statistics data"". The actions do not directly relate to the UK's draft legislation, with the EU reserving the right to take further action if that law ever comes into effect. ""If this draft bill becomes law, of course I cannot exclude anything,"" Mr Sefcovic said. The EU also gave more detail,externalon its own proposals to ease checks which they say can resolve issues of concern in Northern Ireland. These include an expanded trusted trader arrangement covering more products and companies and a cut to customs administration. Mr Sefcovic said the proposals were ""all about simplification"" and at the news conference, attempted to demonstrate this by holding up three documents. ""These are the three pages that need to be filled. Not 300, not 30, three,"" he said. Echoing the UK prime minister's Brexit rhetoric, Mr Sefcovic said the proposals were ""oven-ready"", while adding this was not an ""unconditional offer"". Maros Sefcovic said the EU's proposals would simplify administration But the UK has previously rejected the EU's proposals saying they would make things worse, and if differences are not resolved, there are fears that the row over the protocol could trigger a trade war, which involves putting up barriers to the exchange of goods. A trade war could increase costs for consumers, possibly compounding pressure on household budgets driven by inflation at 40-year highs.

"China has long said that Britain's rule in Hong Kong did not usurp its sovereignty over the territory New textbooks for Hong Kong schools will state the territory was never a British colony, local media report. Instead, the books declare the British ""only exercised colonial rule"" in Hong Kong - a distinction drawn to highlight China's claims of unbroken sovereignty. China has always asserted it never gave up sovereignty and its surrender of Hong Kong to the British was due to unfair Opium War treaties in the 1800s. The UK returned Hong Kong to China in 1997 after ruling for over 150 years. During its rule, it referred to Hong Kong - a port with a deep harbour that grew into a booming city state, and one of the world's leading financial centres - as a colony, as well as a dependent territory. The United Kingdom governed the area from 1841 to 1941, and from 1945 to 1997, after which it was handed back to China. Britain handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997, a date specified by treaty requirements Jeff Li, BBC Chinese China maintains Hong Kong has always been its territory - that the British only occupied it after 1842. And while the Qing government at the time signed successive treaties ceding and leasing parts of the territory to Britain, China argues those were signed ""under coercion"" and never accepted them. Hong Kong's government has been following Beijing's rhetoric since the 1997 handover. It never says sovereignty was ""transferred"" to China, but rather Hong Kong has ""returned to the motherland"". Government museums used to describe Hong Kong as a ""British colony"", but those words were removed in 2020 - a move locals said was indicative of China's strengthening control in the semi-autonomous city. The latest move is in line with Beijing's attempt in recent years to instil a ""Chinese identity"" among Hong Kong students - to sow the idea that Hong Kong has always been part of China, but was taken away for a period under British rule. The new textbooks take pains to explain the differences between a colony and colonial rule - with the texts declaring that for a country to call an external territory a colony it needs to have sovereignty as well as governance over the area. In the case of Hong Kong, the British ""only exercised colonial ruleâ¦ so Hong Kong is not a British colony"", the textbooks say, according to local media reports. How the UK returned Hong Kong to China Hong Kong citizens given 'support' to come to UK The books have been drawn up for a specific course to be taught in Hong Kong schools focusing on citizenship ideals, lawfulness and patriotism. The subject replaces a liberal studies course that sought to teach students greater critical thinking skills and ideas on civic engagement. Chinese authorities directly criticised this course during the city's mass pro-democracy protests in 2019, saying such education had ""radicalised"" young people and given them the wrong ideas. The new textbooks - which have yet to printed, and are pending final approval by Chinese authorities, local media say - also reflect Beijing's characterisation of the mass pro-democracy protests in 2019 as a security threat. Some Hong Kongers carried the Union Jack during the pro-democracy protests in 2019 The South China Morning Post reported one excerpt on the protests reading: ""Secession and subversion against the government were advocated in some of those activities posting a threat to national sovereignty, security and interests."" While incidents of violence did occur during the 2019 protests, the majority of protests were largely peaceful. Human rights groups have also raised accusations of police brutality and mistreatment of peaceful protesters during the period. Timothy Lee, a former Hong Kong pro-democracy lawmaker who is now exiled from the territory, was among critics expressing concerns about a ""rewriting"" of history. Allow Twitter content?

After the handover in 1997, China's Communist rulers classified the city as a special administrative region with its own governing and economic system, allowing individuals more freedoms than on the mainland.

In 2020, it passeda national security law that has in effect outlawed almost all forms of political criticism.

"Tenants could face less choice and higher prices if new rules drive landlords out of the market Landlords said they fear many will sell up and stop renting homes due to Wales' new housing rules. Longer ""no fault"" eviction periods are part of anumber of changes, set to be introduced in December. The Welsh government said it would do all it could to ensure landlords had time to prepare. But tenants have said having six months, instead of two, to find a new home if they were evicted would ease the pressure on them. Landlords have said ""uncertainty"" around the new rules could make some sell on and create a ""housing crisis"" for tenants. It comes as Shelter Cymru said it wasseeing twice the number of tenants being subjected to these evictions. Tenants 'let down' by no-fault eviction rule delay Mum asked landlord to evict her as rent rises Tim Holmes from Aberystwyth, Ceredigion, said he was in a ""state of shock"" when he received a no fault eviction notice. ""I felt I was in a fairly good place up until I received the notice [and] when I did, things started to unravel a bit,"" he said. Tim Holmes said ""things started to unravel"" when he was given a ""no fault"" notice with two months' warning Mr Holmes said facing eviction with just two months notice under the current rules meant tenants could ""never quite feel secure"". ""I think it's profoundly debilitating psychologically,"" he said. His case has yet to be concluded. Meanwhile, Claire Green, from Miskin, Rhondda Cynon Taf, said she could no longer take the ""risk"" of being a landlord. The single mum said she had already sold several of her properties. Renting law brings in six-month eviction notice Buying a home an 'unachievable dream' for many She blamed the Renting Homes (Wales) Act for placing too much risk on landlords. ""There are a number of clauses coming in which could potentially send some people with a smaller portfolio like myself bankrupt,"" she said. ""A couple of properties, I was making very little profit on,"" she added. ""I didn't feel confident enough to be continuing to self-manage and I just thought I can't do this anymore."" Landlord Claire Green says new housing rules have forced her to sell homes Claire said many smaller landlords are worried about changing the notice period a landlord must give for a no-fault eviction, from two months to six. ""It's not a nice thing to have to give your tenant notice, however, there are situations that landlords find themselves in, be it through a divorce or financial difficulty and other situations, where they do need to give notice,"" she said. She added that landlords are having to adapt to complete changes in how contracts work. ""When I found out that I was also going to have to replace that straightforward tenancy agreement with a lengthy contract, it was a no-brainer for me because I just haven't got the time. ""I work full-time, I'm a single mother and I haven't got the time to be doing this kind of additional work."" She said even though she had not needed to issue no-fault eviction notices to any tenants, she might have to consider it in the future in order to offload properties. Chris Coates, who runs a Facebook group for more than 600 landlords in Wales, said he was seeing discussions about selling up and quitting on an ""almost daily basis"". Chris Coates says many landlords are anxious about the new rules ""In my experience the vast majority of landlords are good, decent people that want to do the right thing,"" he said. ""There's a lot of uncertainty right now and a lot of anxiety among landlords. ""My fear is that there are going to be a lot of landlords who decide to sell and there's going to be a reduction in the amount of rental stock. ""Landlords could also be so anxious about who they let their property to that it will affect the ability of our most vulnerable tenants to find somewhere to live."" Two types of contracts, one for community landlords and their tenants and one for private landlords and their tenants Landlords must ensure all properties are fit for human habitation, including natural lighting, working smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, and anti-damp standards The minimum period for no-fault evictions is being extended from two to six months for new tenants from December If a tenant breaches their contract the minimum notice period is one month or shorter in cases of anti-social behaviour or serious rent arrears The Welsh government had planned to introduce the new housing law in July, but that has now been postponed until December, in part to allow more time for landlords to prepare. Changes apply to social landlords as much as the private sector, and the head of an umbrella body for housing providers said the Welsh government was told it was ""impossible"" for them to implement the new law by the original date. Katie Dalton, Director of Cymorth Cymru, said the sector had been promised that documentation and regulations would be available six months before the implementation of the Renting Homes Act. She told Walescast, the BBC Wales politics podcast, that this had instead been ""drip fed over the last few months"" - with some published this month. ""At the implementation date that was planned, mid-July, that's really too late for social landlords to be training all of their staff, teams, setting up new IT systems, and making sure all of those new contracts are in place."" ""That's why social landlords, local authorities wrote to the Welsh government and said we're in an impossible situation - we're really finding it impossible to implement on this timescale."" She said social landlords had been dealing with a ""huge amount of pressure"" over the last couple of years, with nearly 8,000 people in temporary accommodation seeking homes, and 1,000 people to housing authorities as homeless every month. At the moment roughly 500 people a month can be moved into permanent accommodation. With Ukrainian refugees as well, there are around 10,000 people trying to find a permanent home. Shelter Cymru said the delay had been a ""great surprise"" with no-fault evictions doubling over the past 12 months. ""We felt it was a real blow for tenants,"" said Jennie Bibbings, the charity's head of campaigns. Jennie Bibbings said delays in introducing the new laws surprised Shelter Cymru ""There are such great benefits in this legislation and we have all been waiting for such a long time for it. ""In our casework, no-fault evictions have doubled over the last 12 months,"" she said. ""From what I hear a lot of them are linked to house sales."" She explained the ""toxic"" combination of a UK house price bubble and major rules may be ""extra impetus to some landlords who are already thinking of getting out of the game."" Carl Sully, 28, said it would have made a ""massive difference"" to his young family if they had six months, rather than two, to find a new home after being issued with an eviction notice by their landlord in Newport. ""Me and my partner both work full-time including overtime and putting in extra hours,"" he said. ""We have struggled to find anything in our price range, as well as the bond and deposit, on such short notice. ""It has had a massive strain on our mental health, family and money worries as we have two young sons to provide for. It was scary."" Carl Sully and partner Sian Davies said having six months rather than two to find a new home would have made a ""massive"" difference Carl said his family eventually needed help from social housing teams and were ""lucky"" to find somewhere in time. Research from theBevan Foundation,externalrecently suggested that a rising number of people in Wales were at risk of homelessness because of a shortage of affordable properties. Data collected from 1,775 rental adverts across Wales indicated only 24, or just 1.4%, were at a price fully covered by the housing allowance. There were previously thought to be 130,000 landlords but Rent Smart Wales, launched by the Welsh government in 2015 to tackle bad landlords, said the real figure is thought to be only 90,000. Jeanne Fry-Thomas, a director at Bidmead Cook estate agents in Blaenau Gwent, said many landlords were ""withdrawing from the private rental market"". ""Many of these landlords rent to people on housing benefit,"" she said. ""The private rental sector is so bad the number of properties available is dropping all the time. That's why we are seeing rents go up so much, it's down to supply and demand."" A Welsh government spokesperson said: ""This type of large reform happens very rarely and we want to do all we can to ensure landlords have enough time to make the necessary preparations and get things right for tenants."" The spokesperson said alongside the Renting Homes Act the Welsh government has launched a scheme offering incentives to owners who do not want to actively manage their property so they can lease it to their local authority instead.

"The first of two payments to help the poorest households with the cost of living will hit people's bank accounts from 14 July, the government says. More than eight million UK homes on benefits will receive Â£326 by the end of July, with a second payment of Â£324 set to follow in the autumn. It comes as part of a Â£37bn government package to help families as energy, food and fuel bills soar. The consumer group Which? said the cash would ""bring relief to many"".

Bills had already risen by Â£700 on average in April. The two cost-of-living payments - worth Â£650 in total - willbe paid automatically to anyone in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Irelandwho receive Universal Credit, tax credits, pension credit and other means-tested benefits. To be eligible for the first instalment, people must have been entitled to the benefits by 25 May. When might the inflation rate come down? Fuel cost: How to save petrol and diesel The government said the cash would be tax-free and not count towards someone's benefit cap. ""We have a responsibility to protect those who are paying the highest price for rising inflation, and we are stepping up to help,"" said Chancellor Rishi Sunak. Karl Handscomb, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation, a think tank focusing on people on lower incomes, said it was the ""right call to target flat-rate payments at low-income households"", although this approach did contain some ""rough edges"". ""The support will go much further for single people than for those with large families. And the fact that they don't automatically go to new claimants means that anyone claiming benefits for the first time since the chancellor's speech - for example if they've recently lost their job - will not get this July payment and will only get the second payment, due in the autumn,"" he added. The date of the second cost-of-living payment will be announced soon, the government says. It announced the policy in May as part of a suite of measures to tackle the soaring living costs. This followed intense pressure on the government to do more to help people. All homes in the UK, regardless of how well off they are, are set to get Â£400 for help with energy bills this autumn, along with a previously announced Â£150 council tax rebate. There will also be a separate Â£300 payment for pensioners, and a Â£150 payment for disabled people, both of which can be paid on top of the Â£650 cost-of-living payment.

"Headingley - Yorkshire's home ground - will host next week's third Test between England and New Zealand Charges have been brought against ""a number of individuals"" by English cricket's governing body in relation to allegations of racism at Yorkshire. The accused, who have not been named, could be banned or fined by the England and Wales Cricket Board. Yorkshire itself has also been charged with breaching the anti-racism rules. Details of abuse first surfaced in September 2020 when former player Azeem Rafiq said discrimination left him feeling suicidal. ""In matters of this nature, our normal practice is not to identify individuals charged at this stage,"" said the ECB. Yorkshire said the ""allegations relate to charges as far back as 2004 up until 2021"". In a statement, the County added: ""The club will need the cooperation of those in position during this time in order to fully consider and respond to the matters raised."" Since Rafiq's accusations became public, 16 members of staff have left Yorkshire in a widespread overhaul of its senior leadership. The ECB said it had carried out a ""thorough and complex"" investigation to establish the grounds for the charges against both the county and the individuals involved. It said the charges arose from alleged breaches of a directive regarding ""conduct which is improper or which may be prejudicial to the interests of cricket or which may bring the ECB, the game of cricket or any cricketer into disrepute"" and its anti-discrimination code. The governing body expects hearings to take place in September or October and for the outcome of each case to be published after decisions are reached. ""It is standard practice for the cricket discipline commission disciplinary panel to publish its decisions and written reasons in full following the hearing,"" the ECB added. Rafiq played for Yorkshire across two spells totalling eight years ""I welcome today's announcement by the ECB and hope we can move to the hearing quickly,"" said Rafiq. ""This has been another gruelling but unfortunately necessary process. It has been a long two years since I went public about my experiences, but I hope this all means that no young player ever goes through such pain and alienation again. ""My preference would be for this hearing to take place publicly, but I am hopeful that we are at least nearing a point where there will be some sense of closure for my family and me."" BBC Sport understands Rafiq is himself likely to be charged at a later date over historical anti-Semitic posts on social media. Rafiqapologised and said he was ""deeply ashamed""for using the language in Facebook messages in 2011, which emerged after his appearance in front of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee. Rafiq gave an interview to ESPN Cricinfo in September 2020 alleging ""institutional racism"" at Yorkshire had left him close to taking his own life. Yorkshire launched ""a formal investigation"" in response and, a year later, an independent panel upheld seven of the 43 allegations made by Rafiq. However the panel's report was not published and no player, employee or executive faced disciplinary action as a result of its findings. The outcome sparked widespread criticism and in November 2021 the ECB suspended Yorkshire from hosting international matches at Headingley ""until it has clearly demonstrated that it can meet the standards expected"". Club chairman Roger Hutton stepped down, as did chief executive Mark Arthur. When approached by BBC Sport, the ECB declined to name any individuals charged. Former Yorkshire and England captain Michael Vaughan, who works as a pundit for BBC Sport and others,revealed he had been accused of making racist comments to Rafiq and others players,but has repeatedly denied the claims. Vaughan told the BBC he never made racist comments while at the county. He admitted regret at some tweets he had sent in the past. Later in November, Rafiq gave details of the racist abuse he suffered to a committee of MPs, claiming captain Gary Ballance and bowler Jack Brooks had used racist nicknames for team-mates. Ballance admitted using racist language,adding that he ""deeply regretted"" doing so. This video can not be played Nov 2021: Ex-England captain Michael Vaughan speaks to BBC Breakfast's Dan Walker Rafiq also mentioned the attitudes of Tim Bresnan, Andrew Gale and Matthew Hoggard towards him at the club. Bresnan has denied ""frequently making racist comments"",saying it is ""absolutely not true."" The ECB has not named those charged. Rafiq's testimony has been backed by others. Ex-Pakistan seamer Rana Naved-ul-Hasan saidhe had encountered the same prejudiceduring his two stints with the county while former Yorkshire academy playersIrfan AmjadandTabassum Bhattihave also shared their experiences of racism. England bowler Adil Rashid said he, like Rana Naved and Rafiq,had heard Vaughan make a racist comment. In December, head coach Gale and director of cricket Martyn Moxon wereamong 16 people to leave the club. Gale won a claim for unfair dismissal- alongside second-team coach Ian Dews, bowling coach Rich Pyrah, academy lead Richard Damms and strength and conditioning coaches Ian Fisher and Peter Sim. The ECB announceda wide-ranging review into racism in the sportandappointed a Muslim inclusion advisory body to help their reforms on Tuesday. Headingley returned to the international fixture list in March after members voted through reforms to the county's leadership structure. It will host the third and final Test against New Zealand next week.

"Bags of fake Wonka bars seized A haul of counterfeit chocolate bars has been seized in raids on American candy shops on Oxford Street. The ""Wonka Bars"" were confiscated on Tuesday by trading standards staff, who took merchandise worth about Â£100,000, according to Westminster Council. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) warned: ""If you have bought these knock-off bars, do not eat them."" The council has been targeting US-themed sweet shopsamid claims nearly Â£8m of business rates are owed. It says it has netted about Â£475,000 of counterfeit and illegal goods in the past six months. Council leader Adam Hug said: ""We need landlords to take responsibility about who they let to."" A mountain of counterfeit chocolate bars covered council leader Adam Hug's table ""The problem is that owners of buildings are turning a blind eye to those who sublet them as it means they are not liable for business rates,"" the new council leader said. ""This needs to stop and we will be stepping up pressure on landlords to make it clear they are responsible for Oxford Street being overrun with these kinds of stores."" The FSA has also issued a warning as it believes the chocolate is being produced or repackaged by unregistered businesses and individuals who could be bypassing food hygiene, labelling and traceability laws.

She said: ""There is no way of knowing what ingredients are in these bars or what food hygiene practices are being followed by the people making or repackaging them.""

"For travellers, the past fortnight has brought a tidal wave of bad news. Cancelled flights, proposed rail strikes and record-breaking petrol prices have thrown people's plans into disarray - and now the peak summer holiday season and the long school break are hovering on the horizon. After more than two years of Covid restrictions, this should be a summer of fun. But are we now heading into a summer of misery? We take a look at where things stand for planes and trains over the weeks ahead. The UK air travel industry has just faced what is arguably its biggest test since coronavirus rules were lifted and it is fair to say, it has been a bumpy ride. Over the Jubilee bank holiday, which coincided with many schools' half-term breaks, 750 flights out of the UK were cancelled, according to aviation data firm Cirium. Around 466 return flights were axed. Although cancellations made up a small percentage of total flights, many passengers were only informed at short notice and faced long queues to check-in bags and get through security. Staff shortages from job cuts made at the height of the pandemic have been driving cancellations and delays, heightening holidaymakers' anxiety that problems will continue into the key summer season. Why are so many flights being cancelled? What are my rights if my flight is cancelled? Add to that the threat of strike action. British Airways workers have voted in favour of supporting industrial action, in a ballot conducted by the Unite union, while Ryanair is facing walkouts by staff in parts of Europe. Jess Baker has been put off travelling abroad this summer after a recent ""nightmare"" 18-hour journey home from Iceland. She, her husband Shaun and their two children had their EasyJet flight into Luton cancelled on Monday. They were given the option to travel home on Thursday but needed to get back sooner so paid Â£1,000 to fly into Glasgow with Icelandair. They shelled out an additional Â£340 to hire a car to drive down to Luton to collect their own vehicle. Jess Baker and her family had their EasyJet flight cancelled from Iceland to Luton ""It's been an absolute nightmare,"" says Ms Baker. ""We quickly decided that we'll go camping here instead. It's not worth the hassle all over again."" Others may have the same idea. Sykes Holiday Cottages says it has seen a 22% rise in bookings in the past two weeks compared to the same period last year. Chief executive Graham Donoghue says it is ""at least in part due to widespread reports of overseas travel disruption"". ""Travellers simply don't want to have to tackle airports and take the risk that their family holidays could be cancelled,"" he says. Since cutting staff, airlines, airports and the companies that provide baggage handling have been recruiting but because new workers have to pass security checks, it takes time. Heathrow airport's boss John Holland-Kayerecently told the Financial Times,externalit could take up to 18 months for the aviation sector to ""fully recover capacity"". Aviation consultant Chris Tarry tells the BBC the situation should improve as more staff are security cleared, but he warns there are ""unlikely to be enough workers in certain areas given wages and working conditions"". And airports ""only work if all of the elements are in place"", he says. Glastonbury Festival returns this year on 22 June, but it might not be that easy to get there now rail strikes have been announced. More than 40,000 RMT Union members from Network Rail and 13 train operators are set to walk out after talks over pay and redundancies broke down. The strikes are due to take place on 21, 23 and 25 June but it is likely services across the whole week will be disrupted. Train drivers are also going to hold their own strikes over pay. Passengers have been advised not to travel on trainsunless necessary during the strikes. Zahid Fayyaz, a solicitor from Brixton who is planning to travel to Glastonbury by train, is worried about the impact the potential strikes might have. Zahid Fayyaz is having to change his travel plans to get to Glastonbury Festival He originally had a ticket for 23 June but because of the planned strike on that day he and his two friends have bought new tickets to travel the day before. It cost them Â£240 and an extra day off work. ""It's going to take an extra two hours, but aside from this I'll be fine. But other people won't be able to take time off work or afford the extra money,"" the 40-year-old says. Railway workers to strike over three days in June When is the rail strike and which lines will be affected? Unions branded selfish by No 10 over rail strikes Mr Fayyaz says he is broadly sympathetic to the rail workers striking, but believes the ""timing is wrong"". Glastonbury Festival is one of several events impacted by potential travel disruption, along with a cricket test match between England and New Zealand in Leeds.  Glastonbury22-26 Third TestHeadingley 23-27 Ed SheeranWembley 25 Some people are switching their mode of transport to buses and coaches. Chris Hardy, managing director of National Express, said the firm had seen an increase in enquiries and bookings during the days of the rail strikes. The walkout could yet be called off if all parties can reach an agreement. That's what John Kuehne, from Fort Lauderdale in Florida, is hoping for. John Kuehne, a Yes fan from Florida, faces rail disruption during his trip to the UK He's traveling to England along with many of his friends from around the world to see prog-rock legends Yes, who are performing at London's Royal Albert Hall on 21 June. But ""everything is up in the air"" now, he says. ""Car rentals, parking, fuel, tolls, and congestion zone fees make it very expensive and inconvenient."" Mr Kuehne also happens to be arriving in the UK just as the cost of filling an average family car hit Â£100 for the first time. He says labour disputes happen but that ""all sides need to come together quickly to find a reasonable solution"".

"ScotRail says it will have to cancel more than 90% of its usual services when a UK-wide strike by signal workers takes place next week. Members of the RMT union working for Network Rail are due to take action next Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. ScotRail says it will only be able to run about 180 services on five routes in the central belt, and warns there will also be disruption on other days. The train operator usually operates 2,150 services on its full timetable. It is currently running a reduced timetable of about 1,500 services due to a separate pay dispute with the drivers' union Aslef, which is now asking its members to accept a revised deal. On the strike days of 21, 23 and 25 June, ScotRail will only run trains on the routes from Edinburgh to Glasgow via Falkirk High; Edinburgh to Bathgate; Glasgow to Hamilton/Larkhall; Glasgow to Lanark; Edinburgh to Glasgow via Shotts. Rail lines will only be open between 07:30 and 18:30, and ScotRail says the last trains will depart well before 18.30. Information for passengers will be availableon its website,external. Other operators will also run some trains on the east coast and west coast mainlines. ScotRail's service delivery director David Simpson said: ""Customers should expect significant disruption to services next week, including on the days between strike action. ""On the five routes where we are able to operate a very limited service on strike days, we're advising customers to seek alternative means of transport and to only travel if they really need to."" Passengers told not to travel by train during strikes Railway workers to strike over three days in June Late weekday trains return after pay breakthrough Events happening in Scotland on the strike days include the Royal Highland Show in Edinburgh, which runs from 23 June to 26 June, and a Barry Manilow concert at the Hydro in Glasgow on 23 June. The industrial action, which has been described as the ""biggest rail strike in modern history"", is expected to involve more than 40,000 RMT members. This includes staff working for Network Rail Scotland and cross-border train operators LNER, CrossCounty, Avanti West Coast and TransPennine Express. Although ScotRail and Caledonian Sleeper staff are not participating in the strike, their services will also be disrupted. The signal workers are employed by Network Rail, which manages most of the UK's railway tracks and stations. Network Rail Scotland's route director Liam Sumpter said: ""We understand the disruption this strike will cause and apologise to passengers for the impact on their journeys. ""We are continuing talks with our trade unions to seek a compromise that would avoid this damaging strike action."" The RMT has said it is open to meaningful negotiations, and that its members have been subject to pay freezes, threats to jobs and attacks on their terms and conditions. The action is separate to the dispute between ScotRail and the Aslef union, which has seenhundreds of trains cancelledeach day after many drivers opted not to work overtime. Some late night rail services resumed after a breakthrough in pay talks last week. Aslef says it is now recommending that its members accept the deal on the table. Results of the ballot should be known on 11 July.

"Rail travel has been disrupted this week by industrial action, including an overtime ban which continues on Friday. Members of the train drivers' union Aslef walked out on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, prompting widespread cancellations. The six-day overtime ban, which started on Bank Holiday Monday and runs until Saturday, will continue to have an impact on some services. Drivers from 16 train operating companies staged walkouts on different days this week. The services affected included LNER, Northern Trains and TransPennine Express, c2c, Greater Anglia, Great Northern, Thameslink, Southeastern, Southern/Gatwick Express, South Western Railway main line and Island Line, Avanti West Coast, Chiltern Railways, CrossCountry, East Midlands Railway, Great Western Railway and West Midlands Trains. The overtime ban also means drivers have not been accepting any extra shifts, which they say are crucial to the smooth running of the rail network. National Rail said train timetables were likely to be affected. Passengers are advised tocheck before they travel.,external Rail passengers with advance tickets can get refunds if the train they are booked on is cancelled, delayed or rescheduled due to strikes.â¯â¯ If passengers have a return ticket they may also be entitled to a fee-free refund if part of the journey is cancelled. Season ticket holders (flexi, monthly or longer) who cannot travel, canclaim 100% compensation for strike dates,external. Aslef, the train drivers' union, is seeking better pay for its members. It says drivers are being asked to accept worse working conditions in exchange for a wage increase. Strike action began in July 2022 but no formal talks have taken place between the two sides since April 2023, when the most recent pay deal was rejected. The offer, described as ""risible"" by Aslef, included 4% pay rises two years in a row, on the condition drivers accepted changes to training and negotiated new work patterns. Train operators say ways of working need to change for wages to rise, because of the financial challenges they are facing and to ensure fairness to taxpayers. The body which negotiates on behalf of the rail companies, the Rail Delivery Group, says it continues to ""seek a fair agreement"". Unions need to re-ballot members every six months to see if they want to continue with industrial action. Currently, unions are obliged to give at least 14 days' notice of any strike action. In November last year, RMT members, including guards and ticket office staff,voted to accept a pay offer. This included a backdated pay rise of 5% for 2022-23 and job security guarantees. Talks over future pay deals and working practices will continue. A new law meanstrain companies can require enough staff to work on strike daysto run 40% of services. The Department for Transport said it expects employers to use minimum service levels ""if appropriate to do so, and to deliver the best possible service"". PM 'disappointed' as new rail strike law not used However, industry insiders told the BBC that applying the new rules was complicated. One source said it meant co-ordinating a reduced timetable with other operators in a short space of time. The Rail Delivery Group, a membership organisation of Britain's train operating companies, said the minimum services levels law was a potential tool but not a ""silver bullet"". Unions strongly oppose it. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) says median pay for ""train and tram drivers"" is just under Â£59,000. Train companies and the government say the offer rejected by Aslef would take average train driver pay to Â£65,000. The average salary of rail workers in 2022 was Â£45,919,according to the ONS.,external If drivers are excluded (because they tend to be members of the Aslef union, not RMT) its estimate is Â£39,518. However, the RMT union said that figure was too high because it does not include rail cleaning staff. Will you be affected by the strikes?

"The Home Secretary Priti Patel defends the government's policy of sending asylum seekers from the UK to Rwanda The first flight was cancelled shortly before take-off last night after a late intervention from the European Court of Human Rights Speaking in the Commons, Patel says the government ""remains committed"" to the policy of sending some asylum seekers to Rwanda Yvette Cooper, the shadow Home Secretary, says the policy is shameful, and Patel has no-one but herself to blame for the grounding of the flight Boris Johnson has also been answering questions in the Commons where Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer pressed him on the economy The Labour leader says the PM is ""running the country down"" while Johnson attacks Labour's record on taxes and jobs Edited by Chris Giles and Emma Owen That's it for our live coverage of the Commons for now. As ever, you can read more detail on the topics covered on ourpolitics pages, and we'll keep updating the Rwanda policy story too - it's easily found on ourhome page. Today's contributors were Heather Sharp, Richard Morris, Chas Geiger and the page was edited by Chris Giles with help from Emma Owen. Before we heard from Priti Patel on Rwanda, we had the weekly session of PMQs. So what did the MPs talk about? The economyfeatured heavily, with Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer repeatedly asked Boris Johnson about the UK's economic performance following the third month of negative growth and wages not rising to keep in line with inflation. He accused the prime minister of being like Star Wars character Jabba the Hutt and said that the prime minister was ""actively making things worse"" in the UK. The PM insisted that the UK will have the fastest growth in the G7 this year, because the right decisions were taken following the pandemic. The SNP challenged Boris Johnson onScottish independence, saying that the evidence was ""overwhelming"" that Scotland would perform better outside of the UK. The PM replied to say that now wasn't the time to talk about it. Meanwhile, Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey said the government was not doing enough to helprural communities, who are mostly reliant on cars, with the rising cost of fuel duty. Boris Johnson said the Lib Dems were ""bamboozling"" voters with their policies on rural areas. MPs have finished talking about the government's Rwanda policy now, so what did we learn? Home Secretary Priti Patelsaid the decision by the European Court of Human Rights last night to intervene in the plane's departure and stop it from taking off was ""surprising"" and that the second flight, planned soon, would still go ahead. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooperaccused the government of dropping their cases in the courts which caused the flight to be grounded. She said the policy went against the tradition of Britain helping those in need. She said the government was ""picking fights"" to distract from other matters. The SNP's Stuart McDonaldsaid the home secretary was living incloud cuckoo land, and that the policy was unworkable, illegal and immoral. They said the flight was stopped because of the ""stench of more government illegality"". Green MP Caroline Lucassaid the government hadn't done enoughdue diligenceto make sure those being transferred would be safe, and Labour MP Clive Efford said on account of crossings still taking place yesterday, that the policy was not acting as a deterrent. The Lib Dems' Alistair Carmichael pointed out that most asylum claims are genuine. Away from the Commons, the UK's Attorney General, Suella Braverman, has been on the airwaves. Asked whether the government was considering pulling out of the European Convention on Human Rights, she said all options were on the table and no firm position had been reached. ""We're going to consider everything as exhaustively as possible to achieve our goal - that goal being to stop the illicit and criminal process of people smuggling across the channel,"" she said. She described the situation as ""frustrating"" but stressed, that last night's ECHR ruling was ""not a determination of the lawfulness of the policy"" although, she said, ""it has caused a setback"". Asked about comments by the prime minister suggesting lawyers representing migrants were ""effectively abetting criminal gangs"", she questioned the way his comments have been reported. She said Johnson was ""expressing his robust criticism of the criminal gangs who abuse vulnerable people looking for safety"" and ""nothing he said would stop lawyers acting as they should"". Former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn says the government should not be attacking lawyers who represent ""desperate and frightened people"" or the courts who rule on these issues. Instead he urges it to support the European Convention on Human Rights because it protects everybody. Mr Corbyn describes the Rwanda asylum policy as an ""utter disgrace"" and a ""dereliction of duty, treating desperate people as chattels"" who can be sent away to other countries. The home secretary says Mr Corbyn has been ""consistent in his approach"" to these issues, but she disagrees with his views. The Liberal Democrats' Alistair Carmichael seizes on Priti Patel's comment that ""it's no use pretending they [asylum seekers] are fleeing persecution when they're not"". He says 98% of people crossing the Channel claim asylum, and nearly 80% eventually have their claims granted. He suggests the home secretary is either ""demonising"" them, the Home Office's figures are wrong, or the Home Office is granting asylum to people who are not fleeing persecution. Ms Patel says he's ""wrong on all counts"". She says migrants crossing the Channel are coming from a ""safe country"" - France. And, she adds, the government is working to end what she calls the exploitation of the asylum system and to speed up the process. This video can not be played In her statement, the home secretary says the government remains committed to sending asylum seekers from the UK to Rwanda, and says plans for future flights have begun. Labour MP Clive Efford says that yesterday 444 people made the dangerous crossing across the Channel in small boats, ""which suggests that the deterrent effect of this policy is not getting through"". ""That's the highest number in two months,"" he states. He asks if this is now not the time to cut the National Crime Agency's funding. Home Secretary Priti Patel says ""this isn't the time to sit on our hands and do nothing"". Green MP Caroline Lucas says that the government is not taking the ""most basic"" checks to make sure that Rwanda will not abuse or treat the asylum seekers badly. Home Secretary Priti Patel says the government have had staff based in Rwanda for two months to ensure that safe processes are in place for those moved under the scheme.  The SNP's Stuart McDonald says the policy is unworkable, illegal and immoral. It does nothing to stop smugglers, he says, adding that the home secretary's description shows she is in ""cloud cuckoo land"". He says he wholeheartedly welcomes the cancellation of the flight. He says the flight was stopped because of the ""stench of more government illegality"", and that pressing ahead before the case was settled showed disregard for the rule of law. Patel replies that the European Court of Human Rights did not rule that the policy or the removals were unlawful - it just prohibited the removal of three people on the flight. That is separate from the issue of the policy, she says. Home Secretary Priti Patel says Labour ""have shut the door firmly"" on trying to tackle people traffickers across the Channel. She says Denmark are ""in the process"" of looking at a similar scheme. ""The purpose of the work that we are doing is absolutely to break the business model of the people smugglers,"" she states. She says these asylum seekers ""haven't come from Syria, they've come from France, a safe country"". The logic of the opposition is that Rwanda is a ""wonderful country"" for dignitaries but not for asylum seekers to be sent to. The government is ""committed to pioneering a way forward,"" she states. On the amount of money the scheme costs, she says you cannot place a price on a life lost at sea in the English Channel. Cooper says Patel promised Rwanda extra payments for each person that was transferred - presumably to pay for case workers and support - but she says Patel still refuses to say how much. So, she asks, how much did she promise for each of the people she was planning to send yesterday, and how many Rwandan refugees she would take in return? What is she hiding, she asks? Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper says the government spent Â£500,000 on chartering the plane to Rwanda last night, fully aware that it would never take off. She says this is a government which is ""picking fights"" and ""trashing"" the UK's reputation abroad by enacting this asylum seeker policy. Yvette Cooper goes on to ask whether it is true that the Home Office itself gave up on the remaining legal action, therefore grounding the flight last night to Rwanda? Yvette Cooper, the shadow Home Secretary says this is a shambles, and is shameful, and the Home Secretary has no-one but herself to blame. She says this has never been a serious policy and says that Priti Patel knew that among the people she was planning to send to Rwanda on Tuesday were torture and trafficking victims. She knew she had no proper screening process in place and some of them were children, Cooper says. More now from the Home Secretary who says the global asylum system is broken, and international problems require international solutions. She says inaction is not a ""morally responsible"" option. Priti Patel says the UK's partnership with Rwanda shows the way forward - countries working together. She says Rwanda has been ""terribly misrepresented"" and has a good track record in dealing with refugees and asylum seekers. It is a ""safe and secure country"", she says, adding that people who go there will have opportunities to thrive with generous support. Patel says the government won't be providing a running commentary on future flights. But she insists it will not be put off by ""inevitable last-minute legal challenges"". She says the UK has a ""long, proud tradition"" of helping those who need it the most - and this government is no different. It's a ""grotesque slur"" to suggest otherwise, she says. Critics of the policy have offered no practical solutions, Patel adds. This video can not be played Priti Patel on UK flights to Rwanda for asylum seekers Reality Check Earlier during PMQs, Labour leader Keir Starmer asked why ""Britain is set for lower growth than every major economy except Russia"". The prime minister responded that ""in addition to the fastest growth in the G7 last year we're going to have the second fastest this year and we will return to the top of the table."" In 2021, the UK grew by 7.4%, which was the fastest in the G7, following its 9.3% contraction the previous year, which was the biggest decline in the G7. In 2022, the IMF forecasts the UK will have 3.7% growth, the joint second highest in the G7 (behind Canada). Mr Starmer was referring to the forecasts for 2023, when the OECD predicts zero growth. Of G20 economies, only Russia is expected to do worse - it's expected to contract this year and next.  The European Court of Human Rights did not rule that the policy was illegal, she states. The decision was ""surprising"" but the government ""remains committed to this policy,"" she says. Over 20,000 people have used ""safe and legal routes"" to come to the UK since 2015, she says, but ""our capacity to help those in need is severely compromised by those who come here illegally"". The government is spending nearly Â£5m a day on housing asylum seekers, she states. Home Secretary Priti Patel says she wants to make a statement on Britain's ""world-leading"" co-operation agreement with Rwanda. She says during the course of this week, she has ""welcomed"" the decisions of the UK's domestic courts, but due to a decision by an ""out of hours"" judge in Strasbourg, the flight was grounded minutes before it was due to depart.

"Headingley - Yorkshire's home ground - will host next week's third Test between England and New Zealand Charges have been brought against ""a number of individuals"" by English cricket's governing body in relation to allegations of racism at Yorkshire. The accused, who have not been named, could be banned or fined by the England and Wales Cricket Board. Yorkshire itself has also been charged with breaching the anti-racism rules. Details of abuse first surfaced in September 2020 when former player Azeem Rafiq said discrimination left him feeling suicidal. ""In matters of this nature, our normal practice is not to identify individuals charged at this stage,"" said the ECB. Yorkshire said the ""allegations relate to charges as far back as 2004 up until 2021"". In a statement, the County added: ""The club will need the cooperation of those in position during this time in order to fully consider and respond to the matters raised."" Since Rafiq's accusations became public, 16 members of staff have left Yorkshire in a widespread overhaul of its senior leadership. The ECB said it had carried out a ""thorough and complex"" investigation to establish the grounds for the charges against both the county and the individuals involved. It said the charges arose from alleged breaches of a directive regarding ""conduct which is improper or which may be prejudicial to the interests of cricket or which may bring the ECB, the game of cricket or any cricketer into disrepute"" and its anti-discrimination code. The governing body expects hearings to take place in September or October and for the outcome of each case to be published after decisions are reached. ""It is standard practice for the cricket discipline commission disciplinary panel to publish its decisions and written reasons in full following the hearing,"" the ECB added. Rafiq played for Yorkshire across two spells totalling eight years ""I welcome today's announcement by the ECB and hope we can move to the hearing quickly,"" said Rafiq. ""This has been another gruelling but unfortunately necessary process. It has been a long two years since I went public about my experiences, but I hope this all means that no young player ever goes through such pain and alienation again. ""My preference would be for this hearing to take place publicly, but I am hopeful that we are at least nearing a point where there will be some sense of closure for my family and me."" BBC Sport understands Rafiq is himself likely to be charged at a later date over historical anti-Semitic posts on social media. Rafiqapologised and said he was ""deeply ashamed""for using the language in Facebook messages in 2011, which emerged after his appearance in front of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee. Rafiq gave an interview to ESPN Cricinfo in September 2020 alleging ""institutional racism"" at Yorkshire had left him close to taking his own life. Yorkshire launched ""a formal investigation"" in response and, a year later, an independent panel upheld seven of the 43 allegations made by Rafiq. However the panel's report was not published and no player, employee or executive faced disciplinary action as a result of its findings. The outcome sparked widespread criticism and in November 2021 the ECB suspended Yorkshire from hosting international matches at Headingley ""until it has clearly demonstrated that it can meet the standards expected"". Club chairman Roger Hutton stepped down, as did chief executive Mark Arthur. When approached by BBC Sport, the ECB declined to name any individuals charged. Former Yorkshire and England captain Michael Vaughan, who works as a pundit for BBC Sport and others,revealed he had been accused of making racist comments to Rafiq and others players,but has repeatedly denied the claims. Vaughan told the BBC he never made racist comments while at the county. He admitted regret at some tweets he had sent in the past. Later in November, Rafiq gave details of the racist abuse he suffered to a committee of MPs, claiming captain Gary Ballance and bowler Jack Brooks had used racist nicknames for team-mates. Ballance admitted using racist language,adding that he ""deeply regretted"" doing so. This video can not be played Nov 2021: Ex-England captain Michael Vaughan speaks to BBC Breakfast's Dan Walker Rafiq also mentioned the attitudes of Tim Bresnan, Andrew Gale and Matthew Hoggard towards him at the club. Bresnan has denied ""frequently making racist comments"",saying it is ""absolutely not true."" The ECB has not named those charged. Rafiq's testimony has been backed by others. Ex-Pakistan seamer Rana Naved-ul-Hasan saidhe had encountered the same prejudiceduring his two stints with the county while former Yorkshire academy playersIrfan AmjadandTabassum Bhattihave also shared their experiences of racism. England bowler Adil Rashid said he, like Rana Naved and Rafiq,had heard Vaughan make a racist comment. In December, head coach Gale and director of cricket Martyn Moxon wereamong 16 people to leave the club. Gale won a claim for unfair dismissal- alongside second-team coach Ian Dews, bowling coach Rich Pyrah, academy lead Richard Damms and strength and conditioning coaches Ian Fisher and Peter Sim. The ECB announceda wide-ranging review into racism in the sportandappointed a Muslim inclusion advisory body to help their reforms on Tuesday. Headingley returned to the international fixture list in March after members voted through reforms to the county's leadership structure. It will host the third and final Test against New Zealand next week.

"Petrol prices have hit new record highs every day for the past month, according to motoring organisation the RAC. The cost to fill a family car now stands at about Â£103 for petrol, and Â£106 for diesel, it said. The war in Ukraine and moves to reduce dependence on Russian oil have helped drive up fuel prices, putting households under pressure as food and energy bills also soar. The average petrol price is now 186.59p per litre, with diesel at 192.48p. The RAC called on the government to cut fuel taxes to ease the cost burden on motorists, and to help lower the cost of living. ""New records in the average price of petrol have been set every day for the last month, with a litre rising 21p, which has added more than Â£11 to a tank,"" said RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams. He said that RAC analysis of wholesale diesel prices indicates that diesel could hit ""a previously unthinkable average of Â£2 a litre"", and that ""unfortunately, it has already crossed this threshold at motorway services"". However, rival motoring organisation the AA said wholesale fuel costs had been steady recently, while pump prices had been rising. ""Another penny on petrol is a surprise given that wholesale costs have been level if not lower since the Jubilee,"" said Luke Bosdet, the AA's spokesman on fuel prices. He said if petrol continues to go up at the same rate heading into the weekend, ""the government has yet another reason to call the retailers out"". He said that diesel may yet hit Â£2 per litre, but ""why invite the fuel trade to speed up the pump price rises?"" ""It's a volatile market, nothing is guaranteed until it happens,"" he added.

The Treasury cut the tax in March by 5p per litre in a bid to help motorists, and has asked the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to investigate whether that cut is being passed on to motorists quickly enough. The RAC called on the government to temporarily lower VAT on fuel, and make a further cut in fuel duty, saying the rise in VAT takings since March was now more than cancelling out the fuel duty cut. So far the government has ruled out cutting VAT, saying higher receipts from fuel price increases will be largely offset by lower receipts from household spending less on other goods and services. The government has put together a Â£37bn package to help families as energy, food and fuel bills soar.

"The Home Secretary Priti Patel defends the government's policy of sending asylum seekers from the UK to Rwanda The first flight was cancelled shortly before take-off last night after a late intervention from the European Court of Human Rights Speaking in the Commons, Patel says the government ""remains committed"" to the policy of sending some asylum seekers to Rwanda Yvette Cooper, the shadow Home Secretary, says the policy is shameful, and Patel has no-one but herself to blame for the grounding of the flight Boris Johnson has also been answering questions in the Commons where Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer pressed him on the economy The Labour leader says the PM is ""running the country down"" while Johnson attacks Labour's record on taxes and jobs Edited by Chris Giles and Emma Owen That's it for our live coverage of the Commons for now. As ever, you can read more detail on the topics covered on ourpolitics pages, and we'll keep updating the Rwanda policy story too - it's easily found on ourhome page. Today's contributors were Heather Sharp, Richard Morris, Chas Geiger and the page was edited by Chris Giles with help from Emma Owen. Before we heard from Priti Patel on Rwanda, we had the weekly session of PMQs. So what did the MPs talk about? The economyfeatured heavily, with Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer repeatedly asked Boris Johnson about the UK's economic performance following the third month of negative growth and wages not rising to keep in line with inflation. He accused the prime minister of being like Star Wars character Jabba the Hutt and said that the prime minister was ""actively making things worse"" in the UK. The PM insisted that the UK will have the fastest growth in the G7 this year, because the right decisions were taken following the pandemic. The SNP challenged Boris Johnson onScottish independence, saying that the evidence was ""overwhelming"" that Scotland would perform better outside of the UK. The PM replied to say that now wasn't the time to talk about it. Meanwhile, Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey said the government was not doing enough to helprural communities, who are mostly reliant on cars, with the rising cost of fuel duty. Boris Johnson said the Lib Dems were ""bamboozling"" voters with their policies on rural areas. MPs have finished talking about the government's Rwanda policy now, so what did we learn? Home Secretary Priti Patelsaid the decision by the European Court of Human Rights last night to intervene in the plane's departure and stop it from taking off was ""surprising"" and that the second flight, planned soon, would still go ahead. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooperaccused the government of dropping their cases in the courts which caused the flight to be grounded. She said the policy went against the tradition of Britain helping those in need. She said the government was ""picking fights"" to distract from other matters. The SNP's Stuart McDonaldsaid the home secretary was living incloud cuckoo land, and that the policy was unworkable, illegal and immoral. They said the flight was stopped because of the ""stench of more government illegality"". Green MP Caroline Lucassaid the government hadn't done enoughdue diligenceto make sure those being transferred would be safe, and Labour MP Clive Efford said on account of crossings still taking place yesterday, that the policy was not acting as a deterrent. The Lib Dems' Alistair Carmichael pointed out that most asylum claims are genuine. Away from the Commons, the UK's Attorney General, Suella Braverman, has been on the airwaves. Asked whether the government was considering pulling out of the European Convention on Human Rights, she said all options were on the table and no firm position had been reached. ""We're going to consider everything as exhaustively as possible to achieve our goal - that goal being to stop the illicit and criminal process of people smuggling across the channel,"" she said. She described the situation as ""frustrating"" but stressed, that last night's ECHR ruling was ""not a determination of the lawfulness of the policy"" although, she said, ""it has caused a setback"". Asked about comments by the prime minister suggesting lawyers representing migrants were ""effectively abetting criminal gangs"", she questioned the way his comments have been reported. She said Johnson was ""expressing his robust criticism of the criminal gangs who abuse vulnerable people looking for safety"" and ""nothing he said would stop lawyers acting as they should"". Former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn says the government should not be attacking lawyers who represent ""desperate and frightened people"" or the courts who rule on these issues. Instead he urges it to support the European Convention on Human Rights because it protects everybody. Mr Corbyn describes the Rwanda asylum policy as an ""utter disgrace"" and a ""dereliction of duty, treating desperate people as chattels"" who can be sent away to other countries. The home secretary says Mr Corbyn has been ""consistent in his approach"" to these issues, but she disagrees with his views. The Liberal Democrats' Alistair Carmichael seizes on Priti Patel's comment that ""it's no use pretending they [asylum seekers] are fleeing persecution when they're not"". He says 98% of people crossing the Channel claim asylum, and nearly 80% eventually have their claims granted. He suggests the home secretary is either ""demonising"" them, the Home Office's figures are wrong, or the Home Office is granting asylum to people who are not fleeing persecution. Ms Patel says he's ""wrong on all counts"". She says migrants crossing the Channel are coming from a ""safe country"" - France. And, she adds, the government is working to end what she calls the exploitation of the asylum system and to speed up the process. This video can not be played In her statement, the home secretary says the government remains committed to sending asylum seekers from the UK to Rwanda, and says plans for future flights have begun. Labour MP Clive Efford says that yesterday 444 people made the dangerous crossing across the Channel in small boats, ""which suggests that the deterrent effect of this policy is not getting through"". ""That's the highest number in two months,"" he states. He asks if this is now not the time to cut the National Crime Agency's funding. Home Secretary Priti Patel says ""this isn't the time to sit on our hands and do nothing"". Green MP Caroline Lucas says that the government is not taking the ""most basic"" checks to make sure that Rwanda will not abuse or treat the asylum seekers badly. Home Secretary Priti Patel says the government have had staff based in Rwanda for two months to ensure that safe processes are in place for those moved under the scheme.

"UK airlines have been told to cancel flights they can't deliver this summer to stop a rerun of May's travel chaos. The government and the aviation regulator wrote to carriers on Tuesday telling them to ensure their summer timetables were ""deliverable"". They added that earlier cancellations were ""better"" than axing flights at the last minute. It comes after tens of thousands of passengers have been affected by cancellations and delays at airports. The problem was particularly bad during Easter and last month's half-term school holiday, and British Airways, TUI and Easyjet have apologised. Why are so many flights being cancelled? Cancelled flights fuel summer holiday fears Children and teachers stuck abroad as term starts Staff shortages have been blamed, after thousands of airline jobs were cut during the pandemic and have yet to be replaced despite a spike in post-pandemic travel demand. In their joint letter, the Department for Transport and the Civil Aviation Authority set out five ""specific expectations"" for the sector. They wrote: ""We think it's important that each airline reviews afresh its plans for the remainder of the summer season until the end of September to develop a schedule that is deliverable. ""Your schedules must be based on the resources you and your contractors expect to have available, and should be resilient for the unplanned and inevitable operational challenges that you will face. ""While cancellations at any time are a regrettable inconvenience to passengers, it is our view that cancellations at the earliest possibility to deliver a more robust schedule are better for consumers than late notice on-the-day cancellations."" EasyJet is one of the airlines to have cancelled flights The letter stated that airlines must ""keep consumers informed"" about their rights during disruption, such as having ""sufficiently staffed call centres and user-friendly digital channels"". It also urged airlines, ground handlers, air traffic control and the Border Force work more closely to try to prevent problems. Airlines and unions told MPs on the Commons Business Committee on Tuesday that the staffing shortages blighting the industry were likely to persist this summer. Oliver Richardson, national officer for civil air transport at the Unite union, told MPs it was unlikely the situation would be fixed ""unless we work together"". Representatives from BA, Easyjet and ground handling firm Swissport said they also faced long delays to get security clearance for new staff. Swissport's UK boss, Jude Winstanley, said it had hired 3,000 people since the start of the year, but it was taking up to 90 days to get them a full airside pass due to the referencing process. According to the CAA, up to 4% of UK flights were cancelled during half term and the Platinum Jubilee weekend - up from the usual rate of 1%. Boss Richard Moriarty called the situation distressing and unacceptable, adding that the industry needed to get a grip - although he said it was ""not solely a UK specific issue"". There have been calls for EU aviation workers to be added to the government's shortage occupation list, but aviation minister Robert Courts denied this would help. He told the committee that EU HGV drivers - another industry facing shortages - had been offered up to 5,000 visas to fill gaps in the UK, and only 27 had come forward. ""If there were spare workers in Europe they would be in Schiphol [Amsterdam airport],"" he said. Do you work in the aviation industry? Are you a passenger affected?

"France's President Macron says European leaders are supportive of Ukraine gaining ""immediate"" candidate status to join the EU Macron, Germany's Olaf Scholz and Italy's Mario Draghi were earlier welcomed to the Presidential Palace in Kyiv by President Zelensky The EU leaders inspected war damage on a visit to the town of Irpin which Russian troops occupied at the war's start Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov defends Russiaâs actions in Ukraine, in an interview with the BBC Lavrov also criticises the UK for its policy towards Russia Meanwhile, 10,000 civilians are trapped in the embattled eastern city of Severodonetsk, a regional governor says We're pausing our live coverage of the war in Ukraine for now. Today's updates were brought to you by Paul Gribben, Nathan Williams, Holly Wallis, Catherine Evans, Emily McGarvey, James Clarke, Chris Giles, James FitzGerald and Alex Kleiderman. President Zelensky welcomed France's President Macron to Kyiv Thanks for joining today's coverage of the war in Ukraine. Here's a quick look back at some of Thursday's key developments. Kyiv's EU bid backed by four leaders  Lavrov defends invasion  Other headlines  Russia's aggression in Ukraine is a game-changer, Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has said. Stoltenberg has been speaking in Brussels where defence ministers from member countries of the military alliance and a handful of other allies have been meeting to discuss the situation in Ukraine. He says progress has been made in many areas and, in a meeting with the Ukrainian defence minister last night, they discussed the ""imperative need for our continued support as Russia conducts a relentless war of attrition against Ukraine"". Stoltenberg says Ukraine's allies have announced additional assistance, ""including much-needed heavy weapons and long range systems"" and also discussed plans to support the country for the longer term and to step up Nato's ""presence, capabilities and readiness"". The Russian Orthodox Church has dismissed sanctions against its leader, Patriarch Kirill, imposed by Britain for his support of Moscow's military intervention in Ukraine. It targeted the 75-year-old cleric and ally of President Vladimir Putin two weeks after the EU dropped him from their own sanctions list after opposition from Hungary. ""Attempts to intimidate the primate of the Russian Church with something or to force him to renounce his views are senseless, absurd and unpromising,"" church spokesman Vladimir Legoyda said on Telegram. He added that the Church was ""the last bridge, a means of communication, which they are trying to destroy for some reason. ""This may be necessary only for those political forces that have the escalation of conflict and the alienation of peace as their important goal,"" Legoyda said. Vitaliy ShevchenkoReporting from Moscow Officials installed by Moscow in recently occupied areas of Ukraine say newly-born children there will be given Russian citizenship. This will apply to babies born in the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions since the start of the Russian invasion on 24 February, state-run news agency RIA Novosti reports. Currently, most of the two regions are under Russian occupation. The deputy head of the Russia-backed administration in the Kherson region, Kirill Stremousov,told RIA Novosti,externalon 16 February that newborns will be given Russian citizenship ""automatically"". Vladimir Rogov, a member of the Russia-backed administration in occupied parts of the Zaporizhzhia region,told RIA Novosti,externalthat the instruction to give Russian citizenship to newborns came from Vladimir Putin's office. In May, Putin issued a decree simplifying the procedure of obtaining Russian citizenship for residents of the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions.The EU called it,externalpart of Russia's attempts to ""forcefully integrate"" parts of Ukrainian territory and said it will not recognise Russian passports issued there. The Russian military has been focusing its efforts on the Bakhmut area of the Donetsk region and a continued assault on Severodonetsk, Ukraine's General Staff said in a Facebook update earlier today. ""The enemy keeps trying to establish full control over the city of Severodonetsk. They are storming the city, and the fighting continues,"" the report says. The Russian army has opened fire on Ukrainian units in various areas in or near Severodonetsk and shelled a number of towns in the Bakhmut area - but also towns and cities in other parts of the country too. Ukrainian soldiers ""uncovered and destroyed an enemy sabotage and reconnaissance group"" on the route between Yehorivka and Shevchenko in the Donetsk Region, the General Staff said. Macron speaking alongside Ukraine's President Zelensky earlier French arms manufacturer Nexter has been asked by President Macron to increase its production of Caesar howitzer weapons, a source close to the defence ministry tells Reuters. Nexter is being urged to work in a ""wartime"" mode, the source says. During a visit to Kyiv earlier, Macron pledged to send Ukraine another six Caesars on top of the 12 previously delivered. Separately, Macron says it's ""up to Ukraine to decide"" whether to accept any territorial concessions with a view to ending the war - speaking to French TV station TF1 after today's visit. Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv The sister of the
Moroccan man who has been sentenced to death by a Russian proxy court in
eastern Ukraine says she feels his story is being ignored - and that he may be
forgotten. Brahim Saadoune was
sentenced alongside Britons Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner, who have received
much more coverage. Saadoune, 21, was studying in Ukraine but signed up to fight in the defence of Mariupol. When he surrendered
- he was put on trial, along with the other two, not as a soldier but a
mercenary. âAt first, when they captured all of them, then it was like different news about every person,â
Imane Saadoune says. âThere wasn't much
attention on my brotherâ¦ he was left aside a little bit.â The three men do
have a chance to appeal but the separatists have said they see no reason not to
put them to death. It has been left to Brahim's friends to campaign for his life. âHe has a lot of
support. His friends, they are real friends, just starting many campaigns for
him. I just want to tell him that he is loved. He's really loved.â Morocco's main national rights body has now condemned the sentencing, calling for Brahim Saadoune to be extradited to Morocco. Meanwhile, state-run MAP news agency is reporting comments by Morocco's diplomatic sources noting that he was being held by a body not recognised by either the UN or Morocco. Brahim Saadoune (R) was sentenced with Aiden Aslin (L) and Shaun Pinner (C) More now from the BBC interview with Russia's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov. Lavrov has insisted that courts in an
area of eastern Ukraine run by Russian-backed separatists are truly independent. He was being questioned about two Britons
recently given death sentences by a court in the self-proclaimed Donetsk
Peopleâs Republic â after being captured while fighting alongside Ukrainian
troops. Lavrov says he is ânot interestedâ in whether the West views
Russia as responsible for their fate. âI am only interested in international law,â he says. âAccording
to international law, mercenaries are not recognised as combatants.â The families of Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner deny that the
two men were mercenaries, instead saying they are long-serving members of the
Ukrainian military. Challenged with that claim, Lavrov responds âthis should be
decided by a court"". President Zelensky met European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen in April Ukraine's hopes of swiftly joining the European Union received a boost earlier, as the leaders of the EU's three largest economies agreed during a visit to Kyiv that the country should get ""immediate"" candidate status. But that would be just the start of what's expected to be a long journey towards accession for Ukraine. The country's candidacy itself is something that would need to be agreed by all 27 of the EU's member states, following today's positive signals from Germany, France, Italy and Romania. That could happen during an EU summit on 23-24 June. There would then follow a negotiation stage, during which Ukraine could be asked to agree to reforms. These could see Kyiv asked to sign up to a set of values that align with the EU's own. It would likely be asked to stamp out corruption; an issue for which the country was notorious before the invasion. Other hopeful joiners, including a number of Balkan countries, have been stuck at the negotiating stage for years. And EU officials - as well as France's President Macron, who visited Kyiv today - have previously cautioned that it could even take decades for the process to be completed in Ukraine's case. You can read our latest story here. Olha Stefanishyna met France's President Macron and others earlier Ukraine's deputy prime minister says warm scenes during a visit by leaders of four EU nations earlier represent a ""historic breakthrough"" - but warns that Western countries have shown a ""gap [...] between promises and actions"" so far. Those leaders ""now know the price"" of not delivering the right weapons to Ukraine in a timely way, Olha Stefanishyna tells the BBC, in reference to the group's trip to the decimated city of Irpin. Following their visit, a refusal to grant Ukraine candidate status to join the European Union would cause ""enormous frustration amongst Ukrainian people,"" she tells Stephen Sackur on the HARDtalk programme.

This video can not be played EU leaders support Ukraine's membership bid European Union leaders have publicly backed Ukraine's ""immediate"" candidate status to join the bloc, following Russia's invasion of the country. French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi spoke at a news conference in Kyiv, where they all reaffirmed their support for Ukraine joining the European Union. The White House says it is ""working very hard to learn more"" about two US citizens who are missing in Ukraine. Alexander Drueke, 39, and Andy Huynh, 27, both from Alabama, are feared by their families to have been captured after reportedly volunteering to fight as part of a Ukrainian army unit. Reuters reports the pair are thought to have been involved in an operation around the Kharkiv region, but did not return. They are said to have been out of contact with their relatives since 8 June. US officials say there is no confirmation that the two men have been captured by Russian forces. During questioning over the reports on Wednesday, a National Security Council spokesman advised Americans against travelling to Ukraine - urging them to find other ways to support the country. This video can not be played Russia's foreign minister has again defended Moscowâs
actions in neighbouring Ukraine, during an exclusive interview with the BBC. âRussia is not squeaky clean,â Sergei Lavrov admits in
answer to a question from Steve Rosenberg. âRussia is what it is. And we are
not ashamed of showing who we are.â The minister claimed the United Nations is âbeing used to
amplify fake news from the West,â after being read quotes from a UN report
detailing alleged Russian war crimes. Of the invasion itself, Lavrov says: âWe had absolutely no
other way of explaining to the West that dragging Ukraine into Nato was a
criminal act.â Russia has opposed the eastward expansion of Nato, a
30-member military alliance of Western nations. Read Steve Rosenberg's story here. Sergei Lavrov has been speaking to the BBC's Steve Rosenberg Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has dared the UK
government to try to âdefeatâ Russia over its actions in Ukraine. In an exclusive interview with the BBCâs Russia Editor, Steve
Rosenberg, he says he doesnât think thereâs âroom for manoeuvre anymoreâ in
terms of relations between Russia and the UK. âBoth [UK PM Boris] Johnson and [Foreign Secretary Liz] Truss say openly that we
should defeat Russia, we should force Russia to its knees,â says Lavrov. âGo on then, do it!â he adds. Lavrov goes on to accuse the UK of âonce again sacrificing
the interests of its people for the sake of political ambitions.â He continues: âTheir politicians think only about the next
election and nothing else.â Like other Western nations, the UK has provided Ukraine with
weapons to fight Russian invaders â and has also targeted Moscow with
sanctions. Jonathan BealeBBC defence correspondent Britainâs Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has said âthe momentum is still in Ukraineâs favourâ in its fight with Russia. âThat doesnât mean the big Russian war machine is going backwards,â he said, âbut it is not advancing according to their plans"". In an interview with the BBC at a Nato ministerial meeting in Brussels, Mr Wallace said that in some places, Russian artillery outnumbered Ukraineâs by as much as 20 to one. But he said that western nations were now sending more heavy weapons to address the imbalance. Britain has already announced it will be sending Ukraine a small number of multiple rocket launchers â taken from the British Armyâs stock. But Mr Wallace confirmed that Britain would also be  sending 20 self-propelled  artillery  guns to Ukraine. Those artillery guns have been bought from a Belgian arms company to send directly to Ukraine. Mr Wallace said that Britain was still determined to help lead the contributions of weapons to Ukraine. But he said âwe donât have everything in our armed forcesâ. The defence secretary said western nations were also learning lessons about their own âvulnerabilitiesâ from the war in Ukraine - one of them was the need for stocks of ammunition. He added that one of the limiting factors for supplying Ukraine with weapons was âwhat people have on their shelvesâ. Joel GunterReporting from Momotove, near Kharkiv In a field about six miles from the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, the J9 army unit is doing its grim job - digging up bodies of Russian soldiers. In a shallow mass grave under a tree, there are six dead, piled on top of one another in a rough heap. No one here knows who buried them - local residents or retreating Russians. The bodies are swarmed by flies and the smell is overpowering, but the members of the J9 unit and the two diggers who help them are unfazed. They are used to it. The J9 soldiers and gravediggers, including Yurii (front right), carry the bodies out Yurii, one of the gravediggers, got this job after he found five bodies buried in his own garden in a different village, and called the J9 unit to dig them up. ""I helped them dig and they liked the way I worked, because I was a gravedigger before, so now I'm helping them,"" he said. That means going from village to village, every day, exhuming bodies - Ukrainians and Russians. These dead Russians will be taken to the morgue, sampled for identification, and eventually swapped for Ukrainian dead. Yurii served in the army in the Soviet Union. ""Someone is waiting for these men â their fathers and mothers, children,"" he said. âI understand that.â Nick BeakeReporting from Kyiv On the fringe of the joint press conference, I
caught up with Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine's foreign minister. I asked him whether the latest weapons
announced today are too little, too late considering weâre told up to as many
as 200 Ukrainian soldiers are being lost every day in Donbas. ""The announcements of new weapons
delivered to Ukraine should be made on a weekly basis. And these weapons should
be delivered in sufficient quantities. This is the reality. We appreciate
everything that has been done, we do not complain,"" he told me. ""But the truth is that we're still
outnumbered when it comes to artillery, multiple launch rocket systems and
defence systems, and we cannot make any big progress until we strike a balance
with Russia in the numbers on these three positions. ""So do not get me wrong. I'm not complaining. I appreciate
everything that has been done. I appreciate these announcements, but just to
strike the balance, as I said, these announcements should be made a weekly
basis and in sufficient quantities."" There was a joint press conference with the leaders from Ukraine, Germany, France, Italy and Romania We've been hearing from Ukraine's president and the leaders of Germany, France, Italy and Romania who've been in Kyiv for talks. Here's what we learned from their joint press conference:  Ukraine is ""ready to work"" to become
a full European Union member, President Zelensky said after meeting four
visiting EU leaders for talks in Kyiv. At a news conference in the Ukrainian capital
French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Italian Prime
Minister Mario Draghi and Romanian President Klaus Iohannis all publicly backed
Kyiv's bid to join the bloc. EU leaders are holding a summit next week at
which Kyiv's application to become a candidate for membership is likely to be
given a green light. Zelensky said: ""Ukrainians have already earned the right to
go down this road and obtain this candidate status."" Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,5.884393e-17

The Russian army has opened fire on Ukrainian units in various areas in or near Severodonetsk and shelled a number of towns in the Bakhmut area - but also towns and cities in other parts of the country too. Ukrainian soldiers ""uncovered and destroyed an enemy sabotage and reconnaissance group"" on the route between Yehorivka and Shevchenko in the Donetsk Region, the General Staff said. Macron speaking alongside Ukraine's President Zelensky earlier French arms manufacturer Nexter has been asked by President Macron to increase its production of Caesar howitzer weapons, a source close to the defence ministry tells Reuters. Nexter is being urged to work in a ""wartime"" mode, the source says. During a visit to Kyiv earlier, Macron pledged to send Ukraine another six Caesars on top of the 12 previously delivered. Separately, Macron says it's ""up to Ukraine to decide"" whether to accept any territorial concessions with a view to ending the war - speaking to French TV station TF1 after today's visit. Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv The sister of the
Moroccan man who has been sentenced to death by a Russian proxy court in
eastern Ukraine says she feels his story is being ignored - and that he may be
forgotten. Brahim Saadoune was
sentenced alongside Britons Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner, who have received
much more coverage. Saadoune, 21, was studying in Ukraine but signed up to fight in the defence of Mariupol. When he surrendered
- he was put on trial, along with the other two, not as a soldier but a
mercenary. âAt first, when they captured all of them, then it was like different news about every person,â
Imane Saadoune says. âThere wasn't much
attention on my brotherâ¦ he was left aside a little bit.â The three men do
have a chance to appeal but the separatists have said they see no reason not to
put them to death. It has been left to Brahim's friends to campaign for his life. âHe has a lot of
support. His friends, they are real friends, just starting many campaigns for
him. I just want to tell him that he is loved. He's really loved.â Morocco's main national rights body has now condemned the sentencing, calling for Brahim Saadoune to be extradited to Morocco. Meanwhile, state-run MAP news agency is reporting comments by Morocco's diplomatic sources noting that he was being held by a body not recognised by either the UN or Morocco. Brahim Saadoune (R) was sentenced with Aiden Aslin (L) and Shaun Pinner (C) More now from the BBC interview with Russia's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov. Lavrov has insisted that courts in an
area of eastern Ukraine run by Russian-backed separatists are truly independent. He was being questioned about two Britons
recently given death sentences by a court in the self-proclaimed Donetsk
Peopleâs Republic â after being captured while fighting alongside Ukrainian
troops. Lavrov says he is ânot interestedâ in whether the West views
Russia as responsible for their fate. âI am only interested in international law,â he says. âAccording
to international law, mercenaries are not recognised as combatants.â The families of Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner deny that the
two men were mercenaries, instead saying they are long-serving members of the
Ukrainian military. Challenged with that claim, Lavrov responds âthis should be
decided by a court"". President Zelensky met European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen in April Ukraine's hopes of swiftly joining the European Union received a boost earlier, as the leaders of the EU's three largest economies agreed during a visit to Kyiv that the country should get ""immediate"" candidate status. But that would be just the start of what's expected to be a long journey towards accession for Ukraine. The country's candidacy itself is something that would need to be agreed by all 27 of the EU's member states, following today's positive signals from Germany, France, Italy and Romania. That could happen during an EU summit on 23-24 June. There would then follow a negotiation stage, during which Ukraine could be asked to agree to reforms. These could see Kyiv asked to sign up to a set of values that align with the EU's own. It would likely be asked to stamp out corruption; an issue for which the country was notorious before the invasion. Other hopeful joiners, including a number of Balkan countries, have been stuck at the negotiating stage for years. And EU officials - as well as France's President Macron, who visited Kyiv today - have previously cautioned that it could even take decades for the process to be completed in Ukraine's case. You can read our latest story here. Olha Stefanishyna met France's President Macron and others earlier Ukraine's deputy prime minister says warm scenes during a visit by leaders of four EU nations earlier represent a ""historic breakthrough"" - but warns that Western countries have shown a ""gap [...] between promises and actions"" so far. Those leaders ""now know the price"" of not delivering the right weapons to Ukraine in a timely way, Olha Stefanishyna tells the BBC, in reference to the group's trip to the decimated city of Irpin. Following their visit, a refusal to grant Ukraine candidate status to join the European Union would cause ""enormous frustration amongst Ukrainian people,"" she tells Stephen Sackur on the HARDtalk programme.

French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi spoke at a news conference in Kyiv, where they all reaffirmed their support for Ukraine joining the European Union. The White House says it is ""working very hard to learn more"" about two US citizens who are missing in Ukraine. Alexander Drueke, 39, and Andy Huynh, 27, both from Alabama, are feared by their families to have been captured after reportedly volunteering to fight as part of a Ukrainian army unit. Reuters reports the pair are thought to have been involved in an operation around the Kharkiv region, but did not return. They are said to have been out of contact with their relatives since 8 June. US officials say there is no confirmation that the two men have been captured by Russian forces. During questioning over the reports on Wednesday, a National Security Council spokesman advised Americans against travelling to Ukraine - urging them to find other ways to support the country. This video can not be played Russia's foreign minister has again defended Moscowâs
actions in neighbouring Ukraine, during an exclusive interview with the BBC. âRussia is not squeaky clean,â Sergei Lavrov admits in
answer to a question from Steve Rosenberg. âRussia is what it is. And we are
not ashamed of showing who we are.â The minister claimed the United Nations is âbeing used to
amplify fake news from the West,â after being read quotes from a UN report
detailing alleged Russian war crimes. Of the invasion itself, Lavrov says: âWe had absolutely no
other way of explaining to the West that dragging Ukraine into Nato was a
criminal act.â Russia has opposed the eastward expansion of Nato, a
30-member military alliance of Western nations. Read Steve Rosenberg's story here. Sergei Lavrov has been speaking to the BBC's Steve Rosenberg Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has dared the UK
government to try to âdefeatâ Russia over its actions in Ukraine. In an exclusive interview with the BBCâs Russia Editor, Steve
Rosenberg, he says he doesnât think thereâs âroom for manoeuvre anymoreâ in
terms of relations between Russia and the UK. âBoth [UK PM Boris] Johnson and [Foreign Secretary Liz] Truss say openly that we
should defeat Russia, we should force Russia to its knees,â says Lavrov. âGo on then, do it!â he adds. Lavrov goes on to accuse the UK of âonce again sacrificing
the interests of its people for the sake of political ambitions.â He continues: âTheir politicians think only about the next
election and nothing else.â Like other Western nations, the UK has provided Ukraine with
weapons to fight Russian invaders â and has also targeted Moscow with
sanctions. Jonathan BealeBBC defence correspondent Britainâs Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has said âthe momentum is still in Ukraineâs favourâ in its fight with Russia. âThat doesnât mean the big Russian war machine is going backwards,â he said, âbut it is not advancing according to their plans"". In an interview with the BBC at a Nato ministerial meeting in Brussels, Mr Wallace said that in some places, Russian artillery outnumbered Ukraineâs by as much as 20 to one. But he said that western nations were now sending more heavy weapons to address the imbalance. Britain has already announced it will be sending Ukraine a small number of multiple rocket launchers â taken from the British Armyâs stock. But Mr Wallace confirmed that Britain would also be  sending 20 self-propelled  artillery  guns to Ukraine. Those artillery guns have been bought from a Belgian arms company to send directly to Ukraine. Mr Wallace said that Britain was still determined to help lead the contributions of weapons to Ukraine. But he said âwe donât have everything in our armed forcesâ. The defence secretary said western nations were also learning lessons about their own âvulnerabilitiesâ from the war in Ukraine - one of them was the need for stocks of ammunition. He added that one of the limiting factors for supplying Ukraine with weapons was âwhat people have on their shelvesâ. Joel GunterReporting from Momotove, near Kharkiv In a field about six miles from the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, the J9 army unit is doing its grim job - digging up bodies of Russian soldiers. In a shallow mass grave under a tree, there are six dead, piled on top of one another in a rough heap. No one here knows who buried them - local residents or retreating Russians. The bodies are swarmed by flies and the smell is overpowering, but the members of the J9 unit and the two diggers who help them are unfazed. They are used to it. The J9 soldiers and gravediggers, including Yurii (front right), carry the bodies out Yurii, one of the gravediggers, got this job after he found five bodies buried in his own garden in a different village, and called the J9 unit to dig them up. ""I helped them dig and they liked the way I worked, because I was a gravedigger before, so now I'm helping them,"" he said. That means going from village to village, every day, exhuming bodies - Ukrainians and Russians. These dead Russians will be taken to the morgue, sampled for identification, and eventually swapped for Ukrainian dead. Yurii served in the army in the Soviet Union. ""Someone is waiting for these men â their fathers and mothers, children,"" he said. âI understand that.â Nick BeakeReporting from Kyiv On the fringe of the joint press conference, I
caught up with Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine's foreign minister. I asked him whether the latest weapons
announced today are too little, too late considering weâre told up to as many
as 200 Ukrainian soldiers are being lost every day in Donbas. ""The announcements of new weapons
delivered to Ukraine should be made on a weekly basis. And these weapons should
be delivered in sufficient quantities. This is the reality. We appreciate
everything that has been done, we do not complain,"" he told me. ""But the truth is that we're still
outnumbered when it comes to artillery, multiple launch rocket systems and
defence systems, and we cannot make any big progress until we strike a balance
with Russia in the numbers on these three positions. ""So do not get me wrong. I'm not complaining. I appreciate
everything that has been done. I appreciate these announcements, but just to
strike the balance, as I said, these announcements should be made a weekly
basis and in sufficient quantities."" There was a joint press conference with the leaders from Ukraine, Germany, France, Italy and Romania We've been hearing from Ukraine's president and the leaders of Germany, France, Italy and Romania who've been in Kyiv for talks. Here's what we learned from their joint press conference:  Ukraine is ""ready to work"" to become
a full European Union member, President Zelensky said after meeting four
visiting EU leaders for talks in Kyiv. At a news conference in the Ukrainian capital
French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Italian Prime
Minister Mario Draghi and Romanian President Klaus Iohannis all publicly backed
Kyiv's bid to join the bloc. EU leaders are holding a summit next week at
which Kyiv's application to become a candidate for membership is likely to be
given a green light. Zelensky said: ""Ukrainians have already earned the right to
go down this road and obtain this candidate status."" Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,4.1033916e-11
"Petrol prices have hit new record highs every day for the past month, according to motoring organisation the RAC. The cost to fill a family car now stands at about Â£103 for petrol, and Â£106 for diesel, it said. The war in Ukraine and moves to reduce dependence on Russian oil have helped drive up fuel prices, putting households under pressure as food and energy bills also soar. The average petrol price is now 186.59p per litre, with diesel at 192.48p. The RAC called on the government to cut fuel taxes to ease the cost burden on motorists, and to help lower the cost of living. ""New records in the average price of petrol have been set every day for the last month, with a litre rising 21p, which has added more than Â£11 to a tank,"" said RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams. He said that RAC analysis of wholesale diesel prices indicates that diesel could hit ""a previously unthinkable average of Â£2 a litre"", and that ""unfortunately, it has already crossed this threshold at motorway services"". However, rival motoring organisation the AA said wholesale fuel costs had been steady recently, while pump prices had been rising. ""Another penny on petrol is a surprise given that wholesale costs have been level if not lower since the Jubilee,"" said Luke Bosdet, the AA's spokesman on fuel prices. He said if petrol continues to go up at the same rate heading into the weekend, ""the government has yet another reason to call the retailers out"". He said that diesel may yet hit Â£2 per litre, but ""why invite the fuel trade to speed up the pump price rises?"" ""It's a volatile market, nothing is guaranteed until it happens,"" he added.

Fuel prices: How to save petrol and diesel Millions to get first cost-of-living payment from 14 July Do you have questions relating to the price of petrol? EmailYourQuestions@bbc.co.uk,external. The Treasury cut the tax in March by 5p per litre in a bid to help motorists, and has asked the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to investigate whether that cut is being passed on to motorists quickly enough. The RAC called on the government to temporarily lower VAT on fuel, and make a further cut in fuel duty, saying the rise in VAT takings since March was now more than cancelling out the fuel duty cut. So far the government has ruled out cutting VAT, saying higher receipts from fuel price increases will be largely offset by lower receipts from household spending less on other goods and services. The government has put together a Â£37bn package to help families as energy, food and fuel bills soar. More than eight million UK homes on benefits are set to receive Â£326 by the end of July, with a second payment of Â£324 in the autumn.

"Missguided shoppers left out-of-pocket after the fashion brand failed won't get their money back, say the administrators winding up the company. Teneo, which is running the business until new owner Frasers Group takes over, said the company won't be able to honour refunds to customers. It means shoppers like Steph Eady, who sent back Â£190 of clothes, are left to claim through their credit card. When a firm goes bust, customers are often last on the list for repayments. ""I was looking for a dress for a friend's wedding so I naturally ordered lots of options to try on,"" Mrs Eady said. She returned seven items, but didn't receive her money back. ""I messaged Missguided on Twitter and they told me it was delayed by a technical issue but I would get it. ""Now I've had an email basically saying, 'You're not going to get your refund,'"" she said. Steph Eady said the experience would put her off shopping with Missguided in the future Manchester-based Missguided and its menswear brand Mennace went under in May, after its suppliers filed to shut it down overunpaid debts. Pandemic lockdowns initially sent internet shopping sales soaring, boosting brands like Missguided that do most of their business online. However, rising prices have prompted shoppers to cut back, and costs, especially for transport, have put additional pressure on businesses. Competition is fierce for Missguided's 18 to 34-year-old target customers, with rivals like Boohoo, PrettyLittleThing and Shein dominating the market. Two days after their collapse, Missguided and Mennace werebought by Frasers Group, which owns Sports Direct and House of Fraser, for Â£20m. The new owner is expected to take over from Teneo in August. In the meantime the website has stopped taking orders andcustomers have been left chasing orders, returns and refunds. Missguided shoppers left chasing orders and refunds Sports Direct owner buys Missguided after collapse Missguided fast fashion brand collapses ""When you hear they've found a buyer you think it'll be business as usual and you won't have any trouble getting your money back - but that's not the case,"" said Mrs Eady. Other customers received the same email that Mrs Eady had from Teneo which said the ""best option"" was to make a claim via their credit card or buy-now-pay-later provider. It said: ""As the companies are insolvent there is a possibility that there will be no return to creditors from the administrations at all."" Although Teneo declined to comment directly to the BBC, the email said Missguided and Mennace have debts that ""far exceed"" the value of their assets. Teneo also would not say how many customers were likely to be affected. Write to the administrator that's managing the collapsed firm, stating exactly what you are owed and what for If you used a buy-now-pay-later scheme contact your provider for a refund If your purchase was more than Â£100 and you paid on credit card, submit a ""Section 75 claim"" from your provider If you paid by debit card ask your bank for ""chargeback"" within 120 days of the payment Source:Which? Many individual customers will end up as ""victims of the company's collapse"", warned Julie Palmer, partner at insolvency firm at Begbies Traynor.

Buy-now-pay-later brands Klarna, Clearpay and Paypal all told the BBC they would support their customers in getting their money back through their disputes process. Customers who have items at home still that they were planning to return, should not send them back, said the email from Teneo, since refunds would not be honoured. However, it said it was still working to fulfil outstanding orders where possible. Teneo's email said: ""Any money that is left over after the assets are sold may be able to be paid back to creditors, for example customers, suppliers and employees."" However, that process could take months to complete and money owed to suppliers, such as the firms that make clothes for Missguided, would take precedence over money owed to customers. Even Missguided customers who had already been told they would receive a refund from the company should not expect to get one now, the email from Teneo said. Items already returned would not be refunded, and neither would orders that were placed before administrators came in on 30 May, it said. While some customers may be able to reclaim money through credit cards and other payment providers, the anger and disappointment is likely to have damaged the Missguided brand Frasers Group has bought. ""They had a very loyal customer base,"" said Mrs Eady. ""It felt like a community of like-minded people."" But that trust has vanished, she said. ""It's not just affected immediate customers, you're going to tell all your friends."" The Missguided website is not taking new orders Annelie Helgelin, from digital consumer intelligence company Brandwatch, said Missguided had been heavily criticised on social media. Negative mentions on Twitter were up by 1,451% and positive posts down by 30% since 26 Maywhen it was on the verge of collapse, with a lot of the ""angry mentions"" from customers frustrated over missing refunds and deliveries. ""It can be challenging for a brand to reclaim its loyal following after an incident like this, where many customers feel let down,"" she said. ""However, we cannot spot a significant number of conversations around a boycott, which suggest that these consumers might return once the brand has sorted its issues out."" On Tuesday, Frasers' boss Michael Murray announced Missguided's founder Nitin Passi would join the group as chief executive of Missguided. He had stepped down from the same role in April.

"The decision has been taken not to try and protect Happisburgh in north Norfolk from sea level rises Nearly 200,000 properties in England may have to be abandoned due to rising sea levels by 2050, a report says. It looks at where water will cause most damage and whether defences are technically and financially feasible. There is consensus among scientists that decades of sea level rise are inevitable and the government has said that not all properties can be saved. About a third of England's coast will be put under pressure by sea level rise, the report says. ""It just won't be possible to hold the line all around the coast,"" says the report's author Paul Sayers, an expert on flood and coastal risks, adding that tough decisions will have to be made about what it is realistic to protect. ""These are the places we are going to hold, and these are the places we're not going to hold, so we need that honest debate around how we're going to do that and support communities where they are affected."" The study is published in the journal Ocean and Coastal Management. Sayers' report lists the South West, the North West and East Anglia among parts of England with the highest number of properties at risk of flooding. Raised sea levels not only increase the risk of flooding on the coast and in estuaries but also accelerate coastal erosion through larger more powerful waves. The study for the first time looks at places where the costs of improving defences may be too high or technically impossible. It found that by 2050 assuming a conservative sea level rise caused by temperature increases of 2C by 2100, up to 160,000 properties are at risk of needing relocation. That's in addition to between 30,000 and 35,000 properties that have already been identified as at risk. ""There's no real engineering limit to how well we can protect ourselves, so for London for example, the Thames barrier and the all the walls and embankments, they continue to be raised in response to sea level rise."" Sayers explained to BBC News on the beach at Happisburgh in north Norfolk. ""There's not going to be money, under current funding rules to protect everyone."" Happisburgh, a small picturesque old Anglo-Saxon village with a distinct red-and-white-striped lighthouse, is unlikely to receive any more money for sea defences. And its coast is already crumbling fast. Bryony Nierop-Reading has already been made homeless by coastal erosion once The ground under Bryony Nierop-Reading's bungalow fell into the sea in 2013 and there's now a safety barrier across her street which ends abruptly at the top of the cliff. ""Road Closed"" the red-and-white sign says. On it are handwritten dates and numbers where for the past six months the 77-year-old has been documenting the retreating tarmac. ""Eight metres in December 2021, it's 3.4 metres now,"" she says with a sigh. Bryony has good reason to monitor the erosion. When her bungalow was demolished, she chose to move just 50m up the road to a house that is also destined to crumble into the sea. ""It'll probably last until 2030,"" she says. Bryony does not accept the decision from the district council that Happisburgh should not be protected by new sea defences. She points toa Â£20m project just up the coastwhere large amounts of sand have been dumped on the shore to protect a gas terminal. ""It's just such a feeble and unpatriotic attitude,"" she says. ""I think that we should be saying that our country, our land, our agricultural land, is sufficiently important that we need to divert funding to it."" Bryony has launched an organisation to try and attract renewed interest in some new sea defences. ""It's the Save Happisburgh Action Group,"" she tells me. ""The name Shag makes people snigger but a shag is a seabird who has to fight for survival against impossible odds. That's very appropriate for Happisburgh."" Bryony's view is not universally held in Happisburgh. And hers is not the only campaign group. Malcolm Kerby helped organise the ""roll-back"" of homes at risk from the sea ""The sea is very powerful. Even more powerful than Boris Johnson,"" says the booming voice of Malcolm Kirby, one of the founders of Happisburgh's Coastal Action Group. Malcolm is 81 and has been involved in finding a solution for Happisburgh's erosion problem for more than 20 years. Back in 2009, he helped devise a government-backed ""Pathfinder"" project whereby the owners of homes that were about to fall into the sea were offered market price by the government and helped to resettle further inland. He calls it ""roll-back"". ""You either commit to spending billions over an extended period,"" he says.

"ScotRail says it will have to cancel more than 90% of its usual services when a UK-wide strike by signal workers takes place next week. Members of the RMT union working for Network Rail are due to take action next Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. ScotRail says it will only be able to run about 180 services on five routes in the central belt, and warns there will also be disruption on other days. The train operator usually operates 2,150 services on its full timetable. It is currently running a reduced timetable of about 1,500 services due to a separate pay dispute with the drivers' union Aslef, which is now asking its members to accept a revised deal. On the strike days of 21, 23 and 25 June, ScotRail will only run trains on the routes from Edinburgh to Glasgow via Falkirk High; Edinburgh to Bathgate; Glasgow to Hamilton/Larkhall; Glasgow to Lanark; Edinburgh to Glasgow via Shotts. Rail lines will only be open between 07:30 and 18:30, and ScotRail says the last trains will depart well before 18.30. Information for passengers will be availableon its website,external.

"Missguided shoppers left out-of-pocket after the fashion brand failed won't get their money back, say the administrators winding up the company. Teneo, which is running the business until new owner Frasers Group takes over, said the company won't be able to honour refunds to customers. It means shoppers like Steph Eady, who sent back Â£190 of clothes, are left to claim through their credit card. When a firm goes bust, customers are often last on the list for repayments. ""I was looking for a dress for a friend's wedding so I naturally ordered lots of options to try on,"" Mrs Eady said. She returned seven items, but didn't receive her money back. ""I messaged Missguided on Twitter and they told me it was delayed by a technical issue but I would get it. ""Now I've had an email basically saying, 'You're not going to get your refund,'"" she said. Steph Eady said the experience would put her off shopping with Missguided in the future Manchester-based Missguided and its menswear brand Mennace went under in May, after its suppliers filed to shut it down overunpaid debts. Pandemic lockdowns initially sent internet shopping sales soaring, boosting brands like Missguided that do most of their business online. However, rising prices have prompted shoppers to cut back, and costs, especially for transport, have put additional pressure on businesses. Competition is fierce for Missguided's 18 to 34-year-old target customers, with rivals like Boohoo, PrettyLittleThing and Shein dominating the market. Two days after their collapse, Missguided and Mennace werebought by Frasers Group, which owns Sports Direct and House of Fraser, for Â£20m. The new owner is expected to take over from Teneo in August. In the meantime the website has stopped taking orders andcustomers have been left chasing orders, returns and refunds. Missguided shoppers left chasing orders and refunds Sports Direct owner buys Missguided after collapse Missguided fast fashion brand collapses ""When you hear they've found a buyer you think it'll be business as usual and you won't have any trouble getting your money back - but that's not the case,"" said Mrs Eady. Other customers received the same email that Mrs Eady had from Teneo which said the ""best option"" was to make a claim via their credit card or buy-now-pay-later provider. It said: ""As the companies are insolvent there is a possibility that there will be no return to creditors from the administrations at all."" Although Teneo declined to comment directly to the BBC, the email said Missguided and Mennace have debts that ""far exceed"" the value of their assets. Teneo also would not say how many customers were likely to be affected. Write to the administrator that's managing the collapsed firm, stating exactly what you are owed and what for If you used a buy-now-pay-later scheme contact your provider for a refund If your purchase was more than Â£100 and you paid on credit card, submit a ""Section 75 claim"" from your provider If you paid by debit card ask your bank for ""chargeback"" within 120 days of the payment Source:Which? Many individual customers will end up as ""victims of the company's collapse"", warned Julie Palmer, partner at insolvency firm at Begbies Traynor. But there is a glimmer of hope for some shoppers, if they work quickly to try other ways to claw back the money they spent, she said. Some shoppers who paid by debit card have already reported successful refunds throughchargeback,external- a voluntary scheme that Visa, Mastercard and Amex signed up to. Allow Twitter content?

Buy-now-pay-later brands Klarna, Clearpay and Paypal all told the BBC they would support their customers in getting their money back through their disputes process. Customers who have items at home still that they were planning to return, should not send them back, said the email from Teneo, since refunds would not be honoured. However, it said it was still working to fulfil outstanding orders where possible. Teneo's email said: ""Any money that is left over after the assets are sold may be able to be paid back to creditors, for example customers, suppliers and employees."" However, that process could take months to complete and money owed to suppliers, such as the firms that make clothes for Missguided, would take precedence over money owed to customers. Even Missguided customers who had already been told they would receive a refund from the company should not expect to get one now, the email from Teneo said. Items already returned would not be refunded, and neither would orders that were placed before administrators came in on 30 May, it said. While some customers may be able to reclaim money through credit cards and other payment providers, the anger and disappointment is likely to have damaged the Missguided brand Frasers Group has bought. ""They had a very loyal customer base,"" said Mrs Eady. ""It felt like a community of like-minded people."" But that trust has vanished, she said. ""It's not just affected immediate customers, you're going to tell all your friends."" The Missguided website is not taking new orders Annelie Helgelin, from digital consumer intelligence company Brandwatch, said Missguided had been heavily criticised on social media. Negative mentions on Twitter were up by 1,451% and positive posts down by 30% since 26 Maywhen it was on the verge of collapse, with a lot of the ""angry mentions"" from customers frustrated over missing refunds and deliveries. ""It can be challenging for a brand to reclaim its loyal following after an incident like this, where many customers feel let down,"" she said. ""However, we cannot spot a significant number of conversations around a boycott, which suggest that these consumers might return once the brand has sorted its issues out."" On Tuesday, Frasers' boss Michael Murray announced Missguided's founder Nitin Passi would join the group as chief executive of Missguided. He had stepped down from the same role in April. Mr Passi said: ""I am acutely aware of the impact Missguided's administration has had on our stakeholders and I am committed to rebuilding their trust"".

"Nurse Johanna Black retired after 37 years' service but is back doing her old role as part of the NHS staff bank A nursing union has warned some nurses are retiring when they do not want to because of a lack of flexibility from Scotland's health boards. Latest figures show nearly one in 10 nursing and midwifery posts are vacant. The Royal College of Nursing Scotland says health boards failing to accommodate staff who want to change their working patterns rather than leave is making the problem worse. Scottish ministers say they are working to increase flexibility for nurses. The overall number of vacant nursing and midwifery posts across Scotland at 31 March this year was 6,209. This is up from 4,495 at the same point in 2021, an increase of more than 38%. Pandemic has left NHS staff completely knackered Can video calls ease the pressure on Scotland's A&Es? More than 550,000 on Scottish hospital waiting lists RCN Scotland says the issue of retaining staff is equally as important as hiring new people to fill these vacancies. The union is concerned about a ""retire and rehire"" trend where nurses leave their posts and then join staffing banks in order to get the reduced hours or flexibility they want. RCN Scotland director Colin Pullman said: ""People are wanting to continue in a flexible way but, for whatever reason, these opportunities are not being looked at so we're missing the opportunity to retain expertise and knowledge in the service. ""We just need to be a bit more creative, work with people and make sure their work-life balance is right. ""We have over 6,000 vacancies in the NHS so employers need to work with individuals who are either retiring or wish to come back into service, to give them the flexible option that they are looking for."" Nursing and Midwifery Council data shows the number of people leaving its permanent register in Scotland has increased for the first time after two years of decline. In 2021/22 a total of 2,750 people left the council's register, a 16.3% increase on the tally for 2020/21. NHS workforce statistics show spending on bank nurses between 2014 and 2022 increased by 36% to Â£321m, with spend on agency nurses more than doubling (126.2%) to Â£88.9m in the same period. Much of this increase was as a result of the pandemic where there was more reliance on temporary staff. Speaking on BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotland programmeon Monday, Health Secretary Humza Yousaf said the Scottish government and health boards were ""putting in a lot of effort"" to improve conditions for staff who he said had beenleft ""completely knackered"" from dealing with the pandemic. He said: ""Recruitment is one side of the story, the other side of the story is retention. ""I have spoken to a number of nurses who tell me that having worked 30 years in the NHS they are really struggling to stay on. ""I have asked my chief nursing officer to look at whether we can be more flexible right across the board in terms of working patterns and working shifts."" Johanna Black worked for the NHS for nearly four decades and was a senior charge nurse in a community mental health team Johanna Black was overwhelmed with the cards and warm messages she got when she retired from her role as a community nurse in East Dunbartonshire last year. The 55-year-old had worked in the NHS for 37 years so was in a position to start receiving her NHS pension and look for another nursing role with reduced hours. But it was not what she wanted to do. ""If it hadn't been for Covid I would have kept my job,"" she said. ""I loved my job, worked in a great team and was really proud of the service we provided, especially in the pandemic, but I would say the past two years have impacted my health. ""I think I may have been able to negotiate a slight reduction in my hours but financially I wasn't in a position to do that, so my only option was to retire so I could pick up work with less hours that I could cope with."" Johanna with her leaving presents when she retired from her role with NHS Forth Valley Johanna has ended up temporarily back in the same senior charge nurse role she retired from, with reduced hours, but thinks the future will involve doing bank nursing shifts. The 55-year-old thinks there ""should be more options"" for NHS staff in her position as she argues ""a lot of people still have a lot to give"". She said: ""I think people, if they have various options open to them, they might not choose to leave."" Johanna said she was not critical of NHS Forth Valley but added that all of Scotland's health boards ""need to think what can be done to retain that experience."" The Scottish government said staffing across NHS Scotland was at a record high. Health Secretary Humza Yousaf said: ""Since 2006 we have increased the number of qualified nurses and midwives by over 5,500, or by 13.7%; the number of medical and dental consultants by over 2,000, or by 63.2%, and the number of allied health professionals (excluding paramedics) by over 2,000, or by 26.3%. ""The latest workforce statistics also showed that nursing and midwifery vacancies have started to reduce in the last quarter. ""We have recruited more than 1,000 additional healthcare support staff since last October and almost 200 registered nurses from overseas to help address the unprecedented challenges facing the NHS."" He said work was ongoing to enhance NHS workforce levels and support health boards to fill posts. Mr Yousaf added: ""This is backed by our Â£1bn NHS recovery plan which introduced a range of direct workforce investments and new measures to support health boards' capacity for both domestic and international recruitment.""

"Passengers have been advised not to travel on trains unless necessary during strikes next week, with only a fifth of services due to run. Network Rail said about half of all rail lines will be closed when thousands of workers walk out across Britain on 21, 23 and 25 June. The services that run will start and finish earlier, from 07:30 to 18:30. There will be no trains at all in many places including north from Glasgow or Edinburgh and to Penzance in Cornwall. ""Make no mistake, the level of service we will be able to offer will be significantly compromised and passengers need to take that into account and to plan ahead and only travel if it's really necessary to do so,"" Network Rail boss Andrew Haines said. Network Rail, which owns and maintains the country's railways, said there would also be no passenger services to locations including Bournemouth in Dorset, Swansea in south Wales, Holyhead in north Wales, Chester in Cheshire and Blackpool in Lancashire. Open lines include the West Coast Main Line from London to Scotland via locations such as Birmingham and Manchester. However, with trains running for shorter hours on strike days, final departures will be much earlier than usual. For example, the last train from Manchester to London will leave at 14:47 and the last from Norwich to London at 16:00, with the last train from London to Edinburgh at 14:00. Rural and district lines will be most affected by the action. When is the rail strike and which lines will be affected? Are UK travellers heading for a summer of misery? The timetable from 20 June to 26 June is still being finalised, but the number of services is expected to be around 4,500 compared with 20,000 normally, Network Rail said. Disruption is also expected to carry over into non-strike days during the week, when only about 60% of services are expected to run. This is due to not enough staff being on shift overnight to get services ready for the following day. A number of train operators including Southeastern, TransPennine and Avanti West Coast have urged passengers to only travel by rail if necessary, while Northern has asked people ""not to travel"" on trains between Tuesday and Sunday. Several large events could be affected by the strikes, ranging from Glastonbury Festival, which runs from 22 to 26 June, to a cricket Test match between England and New Zealand taking place from 23 to 27 June. Pensioner Linda is supposed to be travelling by train from Great Yarmouth to London for a Rolling Stones concert on 25 June. She paid Â£100 per ticket but she is now unsure if there is any way for her to get there now. ""If I was to book a coach, it would cost a lot more - plus increase the travel time; two-and-a-half hours on the train becomes five to six hours on a coach,"" she told the BBC. ""And there's no way we'd get to the concert in time."" Elsewhere, Megan, a 15-year-old pupil at Bradford Grammar School, doesn't know how she will get to school. ""Both my parents work. My mum is a doctor so she's got to be in [work] really early,"" she said. ""I think we'll just have to organise lifts with someone."" ""It's just stressful. With traffic and everyone getting a lift in, it's going to be a nightmare,"" she added. Megan is worried how she'll get to school The school's bursar Homera Najib said about 300 pupils travel in by train from across Yorkshire and Leeds using the nearby Frizinghall station. She has contacted parents who have to make their own alternative arrangements to get their children to school, she said. ""We know this is going to be a real inconvenience for our pupils, especially at a time when we've got public examinations going on,"" she said. ""These are the first public examinations in two years so something like this that really throws a spanner in the works doesn't help the levels of stress."" More than 40,000 RMT union members from Network Rail and 13 train firms plan to walk out. The industrial action, which has been described as the ""biggest rail strike in modern history"", involves union members which include railway staff such as guards and signalling operators. RMT announced the strike action last week after talks over pay and redundancies fell through. On the first day of the planned strike on 21 June, London Underground RMT workers plan to walk out in a separate dispute over pensions and job losses. Andrew Haines, Network Rail chief executive, said talks with the union had ""not progressed as far as I had hoped"" and so preparations had begun for a strike. The strikes may be less disruptive for commuters, with more people now able to work from home since the pandemic. But the Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators, said ""millions of people"", including those who cannot work remotely, students sitting exams and others travelling for summer events, would still be affected. The mood music right now is that not enough progress has been made in negotiations to stop next week's walkouts. Assuming they go ahead, there will be disruption across the whole week. The involvement of Network Rail signalling staff means the number of trains that can run is particularly limited. On strike days, the signallers' replacements can only cover 12 hours, hence services will start late and finish early - where they run at all. Busy, key routes have been prioritised, meaning vast swathes of the country will be left with no services at all. Network Rail says next week's action will cost up to Â£150m in lost revenue and aborted work. The RMT union has claimed Network Rail plans to cut up to 2,500 jobs as part of a Â£2bn reduction in spending, with the proposed job cuts including workers who maintain tracks, signals and overhead lines. It also said train operators had been subject to pay freezes and changes to their terms and conditions. The RMT has called for a meeting with the transport secretary and chancellor, saying it had become clear that the Treasury was ""calling the shots and not allowing rail employers to reach a negotiated settlement"". But a deal is ""unlikely at the moment"", said RMT's Eddie Dempsey, who accused the government of ""relishing the thought of having a dispute to distract from some other issues"". A Department for Transport spokesperson said unions had ""gone on the record saying they don't negotiate with this government"", adding: ""They're right: they must negotiate with the employers."" The rail industry is under pressure to save money due to the financial impact of the coronavirus pandemic and Network Rail has said it wants to modernise working practices. It estimated between 1,500 and 2,000 fewer staff would be needed, but insists this could be achieved through voluntary means. As part of a separate strike, Aslef, a union representing train drivers, has announced walkouts at three companies in rows over pay on 26 June at Hull Trains, at Greater Anglia on 23 June, and on Croydon Tramlink on 28, 29 June and 13 and 14 July.

"ScotRail says it will have to cancel more than 90% of its usual services when a UK-wide strike by signal workers takes place next week. Members of the RMT union working for Network Rail are due to take action next Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. ScotRail says it will only be able to run about 180 services on five routes in the central belt, and warns there will also be disruption on other days. The train operator usually operates 2,150 services on its full timetable. It is currently running a reduced timetable of about 1,500 services due to a separate pay dispute with the drivers' union Aslef, which is now asking its members to accept a revised deal. On the strike days of 21, 23 and 25 June, ScotRail will only run trains on the routes from Edinburgh to Glasgow via Falkirk High; Edinburgh to Bathgate; Glasgow to Hamilton/Larkhall; Glasgow to Lanark; Edinburgh to Glasgow via Shotts. Rail lines will only be open between 07:30 and 18:30, and ScotRail says the last trains will depart well before 18.30. Information for passengers will be availableon its website,external. Other operators will also run some trains on the east coast and west coast mainlines. ScotRail's service delivery director David Simpson said: ""Customers should expect significant disruption to services next week, including on the days between strike action. ""On the five routes where we are able to operate a very limited service on strike days, we're advising customers to seek alternative means of transport and to only travel if they really need to."" Passengers told not to travel by train during strikes Railway workers to strike over three days in June Late weekday trains return after pay breakthrough Events happening in Scotland on the strike days include the Royal Highland Show in Edinburgh, which runs from 23 June to 26 June, and a Barry Manilow concert at the Hydro in Glasgow on 23 June. The industrial action, which has been described as the ""biggest rail strike in modern history"", is expected to involve more than 40,000 RMT members. This includes staff working for Network Rail Scotland and cross-border train operators LNER, CrossCounty, Avanti West Coast and TransPennine Express. Although ScotRail and Caledonian Sleeper staff are not participating in the strike, their services will also be disrupted. The signal workers are employed by Network Rail, which manages most of the UK's railway tracks and stations. Network Rail Scotland's route director Liam Sumpter said: ""We understand the disruption this strike will cause and apologise to passengers for the impact on their journeys. ""We are continuing talks with our trade unions to seek a compromise that would avoid this damaging strike action."" The RMT has said it is open to meaningful negotiations, and that its members have been subject to pay freezes, threats to jobs and attacks on their terms and conditions. The action is separate to the dispute between ScotRail and the Aslef union, which has seenhundreds of trains cancelledeach day after many drivers opted not to work overtime. Some late night rail services resumed after a breakthrough in pay talks last week. Aslef says it is now recommending that its members accept the deal on the table. Results of the ballot should be known on 11 July.

"The Home Secretary Priti Patel defends the government's policy of sending asylum seekers from the UK to Rwanda The first flight was cancelled shortly before take-off last night after a late intervention from the European Court of Human Rights Speaking in the Commons, Patel says the government ""remains committed"" to the policy of sending some asylum seekers to Rwanda Yvette Cooper, the shadow Home Secretary, says the policy is shameful, and Patel has no-one but herself to blame for the grounding of the flight Boris Johnson has also been answering questions in the Commons where Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer pressed him on the economy The Labour leader says the PM is ""running the country down"" while Johnson attacks Labour's record on taxes and jobs Edited by Chris Giles and Emma Owen That's it for our live coverage of the Commons for now. As ever, you can read more detail on the topics covered on ourpolitics pages, and we'll keep updating the Rwanda policy story too - it's easily found on ourhome page. Today's contributors were Heather Sharp, Richard Morris, Chas Geiger and the page was edited by Chris Giles with help from Emma Owen. Before we heard from Priti Patel on Rwanda, we had the weekly session of PMQs. So what did the MPs talk about? The economyfeatured heavily, with Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer repeatedly asked Boris Johnson about the UK's economic performance following the third month of negative growth and wages not rising to keep in line with inflation. He accused the prime minister of being like Star Wars character Jabba the Hutt and said that the prime minister was ""actively making things worse"" in the UK. The PM insisted that the UK will have the fastest growth in the G7 this year, because the right decisions were taken following the pandemic. The SNP challenged Boris Johnson onScottish independence, saying that the evidence was ""overwhelming"" that Scotland would perform better outside of the UK. The PM replied to say that now wasn't the time to talk about it. Meanwhile, Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey said the government was not doing enough to helprural communities, who are mostly reliant on cars, with the rising cost of fuel duty. Boris Johnson said the Lib Dems were ""bamboozling"" voters with their policies on rural areas. MPs have finished talking about the government's Rwanda policy now, so what did we learn? Home Secretary Priti Patelsaid the decision by the European Court of Human Rights last night to intervene in the plane's departure and stop it from taking off was ""surprising"" and that the second flight, planned soon, would still go ahead. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooperaccused the government of dropping their cases in the courts which caused the flight to be grounded. She said the policy went against the tradition of Britain helping those in need. She said the government was ""picking fights"" to distract from other matters. The SNP's Stuart McDonaldsaid the home secretary was living incloud cuckoo land, and that the policy was unworkable, illegal and immoral. They said the flight was stopped because of the ""stench of more government illegality"". Green MP Caroline Lucassaid the government hadn't done enoughdue diligenceto make sure those being transferred would be safe, and Labour MP Clive Efford said on account of crossings still taking place yesterday, that the policy was not acting as a deterrent. The Lib Dems' Alistair Carmichael pointed out that most asylum claims are genuine. Away from the Commons, the UK's Attorney General, Suella Braverman, has been on the airwaves. Asked whether the government was considering pulling out of the European Convention on Human Rights, she said all options were on the table and no firm position had been reached. ""We're going to consider everything as exhaustively as possible to achieve our goal - that goal being to stop the illicit and criminal process of people smuggling across the channel,"" she said. She described the situation as ""frustrating"" but stressed, that last night's ECHR ruling was ""not a determination of the lawfulness of the policy"" although, she said, ""it has caused a setback"". Asked about comments by the prime minister suggesting lawyers representing migrants were ""effectively abetting criminal gangs"", she questioned the way his comments have been reported. She said Johnson was ""expressing his robust criticism of the criminal gangs who abuse vulnerable people looking for safety"" and ""nothing he said would stop lawyers acting as they should"". Former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn says the government should not be attacking lawyers who represent ""desperate and frightened people"" or the courts who rule on these issues. Instead he urges it to support the European Convention on Human Rights because it protects everybody. Mr Corbyn describes the Rwanda asylum policy as an ""utter disgrace"" and a ""dereliction of duty, treating desperate people as chattels"" who can be sent away to other countries. The home secretary says Mr Corbyn has been ""consistent in his approach"" to these issues, but she disagrees with his views. The Liberal Democrats' Alistair Carmichael seizes on Priti Patel's comment that ""it's no use pretending they [asylum seekers] are fleeing persecution when they're not"". He says 98% of people crossing the Channel claim asylum, and nearly 80% eventually have their claims granted. He suggests the home secretary is either ""demonising"" them, the Home Office's figures are wrong, or the Home Office is granting asylum to people who are not fleeing persecution. Ms Patel says he's ""wrong on all counts"". She says migrants crossing the Channel are coming from a ""safe country"" - France. And, she adds, the government is working to end what she calls the exploitation of the asylum system and to speed up the process. This video can not be played In her statement, the home secretary says the government remains committed to sending asylum seekers from the UK to Rwanda, and says plans for future flights have begun. Labour MP Clive Efford says that yesterday 444 people made the dangerous crossing across the Channel in small boats, ""which suggests that the deterrent effect of this policy is not getting through"". ""That's the highest number in two months,"" he states. He asks if this is now not the time to cut the National Crime Agency's funding. Home Secretary Priti Patel says ""this isn't the time to sit on our hands and do nothing"". Green MP Caroline Lucas says that the government is not taking the ""most basic"" checks to make sure that Rwanda will not abuse or treat the asylum seekers badly. Home Secretary Priti Patel says the government have had staff based in Rwanda for two months to ensure that safe processes are in place for those moved under the scheme.  The SNP's Stuart McDonald says the policy is unworkable, illegal and immoral. It does nothing to stop smugglers, he says, adding that the home secretary's description shows she is in ""cloud cuckoo land"". He says he wholeheartedly welcomes the cancellation of the flight. He says the flight was stopped because of the ""stench of more government illegality"", and that pressing ahead before the case was settled showed disregard for the rule of law. Patel replies that the European Court of Human Rights did not rule that the policy or the removals were unlawful - it just prohibited the removal of three people on the flight. That is separate from the issue of the policy, she says. Home Secretary Priti Patel says Labour ""have shut the door firmly"" on trying to tackle people traffickers across the Channel. She says Denmark are ""in the process"" of looking at a similar scheme. ""The purpose of the work that we are doing is absolutely to break the business model of the people smugglers,"" she states. She says these asylum seekers ""haven't come from Syria, they've come from France, a safe country"". The logic of the opposition is that Rwanda is a ""wonderful country"" for dignitaries but not for asylum seekers to be sent to. The government is ""committed to pioneering a way forward,"" she states. On the amount of money the scheme costs, she says you cannot place a price on a life lost at sea in the English Channel. Cooper says Patel promised Rwanda extra payments for each person that was transferred - presumably to pay for case workers and support - but she says Patel still refuses to say how much. So, she asks, how much did she promise for each of the people she was planning to send yesterday, and how many Rwandan refugees she would take in return? What is she hiding, she asks? Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper says the government spent Â£500,000 on chartering the plane to Rwanda last night, fully aware that it would never take off. She says this is a government which is ""picking fights"" and ""trashing"" the UK's reputation abroad by enacting this asylum seeker policy. Yvette Cooper goes on to ask whether it is true that the Home Office itself gave up on the remaining legal action, therefore grounding the flight last night to Rwanda? Yvette Cooper, the shadow Home Secretary says this is a shambles, and is shameful, and the Home Secretary has no-one but herself to blame. She says this has never been a serious policy and says that Priti Patel knew that among the people she was planning to send to Rwanda on Tuesday were torture and trafficking victims. She knew she had no proper screening process in place and some of them were children, Cooper says. More now from the Home Secretary who says the global asylum system is broken, and international problems require international solutions. She says inaction is not a ""morally responsible"" option. Priti Patel says the UK's partnership with Rwanda shows the way forward - countries working together. She says Rwanda has been ""terribly misrepresented"" and has a good track record in dealing with refugees and asylum seekers. It is a ""safe and secure country"", she says, adding that people who go there will have opportunities to thrive with generous support. Patel says the government won't be providing a running commentary on future flights. But she insists it will not be put off by ""inevitable last-minute legal challenges"". She says the UK has a ""long, proud tradition"" of helping those who need it the most - and this government is no different. It's a ""grotesque slur"" to suggest otherwise, she says. Critics of the policy have offered no practical solutions, Patel adds. This video can not be played Priti Patel on UK flights to Rwanda for asylum seekers Reality Check Earlier during PMQs, Labour leader Keir Starmer asked why ""Britain is set for lower growth than every major economy except Russia"". The prime minister responded that ""in addition to the fastest growth in the G7 last year we're going to have the second fastest this year and we will return to the top of the table."" In 2021, the UK grew by 7.4%, which was the fastest in the G7, following its 9.3% contraction the previous year, which was the biggest decline in the G7. In 2022, the IMF forecasts the UK will have 3.7% growth, the joint second highest in the G7 (behind Canada). Mr Starmer was referring to the forecasts for 2023, when the OECD predicts zero growth. Of G20 economies, only Russia is expected to do worse - it's expected to contract this year and next.  The European Court of Human Rights did not rule that the policy was illegal, she states. The decision was ""surprising"" but the government ""remains committed to this policy,"" she says. Over 20,000 people have used ""safe and legal routes"" to come to the UK since 2015, she says, but ""our capacity to help those in need is severely compromised by those who come here illegally"". The government is spending nearly Â£5m a day on housing asylum seekers, she states. Home Secretary Priti Patel says she wants to make a statement on Britain's ""world-leading"" co-operation agreement with Rwanda. She says during the course of this week, she has ""welcomed"" the decisions of the UK's domestic courts, but due to a decision by an ""out of hours"" judge in Strasbourg, the flight was grounded minutes before it was due to depart.

"Passengers have been advised not to travel on trains unless necessary during strikes next week, with only a fifth of services due to run. Network Rail said about half of all rail lines will be closed when thousands of workers walk out across Britain on 21, 23 and 25 June. The services that run will start and finish earlier, from 07:30 to 18:30. There will be no trains at all in many places including north from Glasgow or Edinburgh and to Penzance in Cornwall. ""Make no mistake, the level of service we will be able to offer will be significantly compromised and passengers need to take that into account and to plan ahead and only travel if it's really necessary to do so,"" Network Rail boss Andrew Haines said. Network Rail, which owns and maintains the country's railways, said there would also be no passenger services to locations including Bournemouth in Dorset, Swansea in south Wales, Holyhead in north Wales, Chester in Cheshire and Blackpool in Lancashire. Open lines include the West Coast Main Line from London to Scotland via locations such as Birmingham and Manchester. However, with trains running for shorter hours on strike days, final departures will be much earlier than usual. For example, the last train from Manchester to London will leave at 14:47 and the last from Norwich to London at 16:00, with the last train from London to Edinburgh at 14:00. Rural and district lines will be most affected by the action. When is the rail strike and which lines will be affected? Are UK travellers heading for a summer of misery? The timetable from 20 June to 26 June is still being finalised, but the number of services is expected to be around 4,500 compared with 20,000 normally, Network Rail said. Disruption is also expected to carry over into non-strike days during the week, when only about 60% of services are expected to run. This is due to not enough staff being on shift overnight to get services ready for the following day. A number of train operators including Southeastern, TransPennine and Avanti West Coast have urged passengers to only travel by rail if necessary, while Northern has asked people ""not to travel"" on trains between Tuesday and Sunday. Several large events could be affected by the strikes, ranging from Glastonbury Festival, which runs from 22 to 26 June, to a cricket Test match between England and New Zealand taking place from 23 to 27 June. Pensioner Linda is supposed to be travelling by train from Great Yarmouth to London for a Rolling Stones concert on 25 June. She paid Â£100 per ticket but she is now unsure if there is any way for her to get there now. ""If I was to book a coach, it would cost a lot more - plus increase the travel time; two-and-a-half hours on the train becomes five to six hours on a coach,"" she told the BBC. ""And there's no way we'd get to the concert in time."" Elsewhere, Megan, a 15-year-old pupil at Bradford Grammar School, doesn't know how she will get to school. ""Both my parents work. My mum is a doctor so she's got to be in [work] really early,"" she said. ""I think we'll just have to organise lifts with someone."" ""It's just stressful. With traffic and everyone getting a lift in, it's going to be a nightmare,"" she added. Megan is worried how she'll get to school The school's bursar Homera Najib said about 300 pupils travel in by train from across Yorkshire and Leeds using the nearby Frizinghall station. She has contacted parents who have to make their own alternative arrangements to get their children to school, she said. ""We know this is going to be a real inconvenience for our pupils, especially at a time when we've got public examinations going on,"" she said. ""These are the first public examinations in two years so something like this that really throws a spanner in the works doesn't help the levels of stress."" More than 40,000 RMT union members from Network Rail and 13 train firms plan to walk out. The industrial action, which has been described as the ""biggest rail strike in modern history"", involves union members which include railway staff such as guards and signalling operators. RMT announced the strike action last week after talks over pay and redundancies fell through. On the first day of the planned strike on 21 June, London Underground RMT workers plan to walk out in a separate dispute over pensions and job losses. Andrew Haines, Network Rail chief executive, said talks with the union had ""not progressed as far as I had hoped"" and so preparations had begun for a strike. The strikes may be less disruptive for commuters, with more people now able to work from home since the pandemic. But the Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators, said ""millions of people"", including those who cannot work remotely, students sitting exams and others travelling for summer events, would still be affected. The mood music right now is that not enough progress has been made in negotiations to stop next week's walkouts. Assuming they go ahead, there will be disruption across the whole week. The involvement of Network Rail signalling staff means the number of trains that can run is particularly limited. On strike days, the signallers' replacements can only cover 12 hours, hence services will start late and finish early - where they run at all. Busy, key routes have been prioritised, meaning vast swathes of the country will be left with no services at all. Network Rail says next week's action will cost up to Â£150m in lost revenue and aborted work. The RMT union has claimed Network Rail plans to cut up to 2,500 jobs as part of a Â£2bn reduction in spending, with the proposed job cuts including workers who maintain tracks, signals and overhead lines. It also said train operators had been subject to pay freezes and changes to their terms and conditions. The RMT has called for a meeting with the transport secretary and chancellor, saying it had become clear that the Treasury was ""calling the shots and not allowing rail employers to reach a negotiated settlement"". But a deal is ""unlikely at the moment"", said RMT's Eddie Dempsey, who accused the government of ""relishing the thought of having a dispute to distract from some other issues"". A Department for Transport spokesperson said unions had ""gone on the record saying they don't negotiate with this government"", adding: ""They're right: they must negotiate with the employers."" The rail industry is under pressure to save money due to the financial impact of the coronavirus pandemic and Network Rail has said it wants to modernise working practices. It estimated between 1,500 and 2,000 fewer staff would be needed, but insists this could be achieved through voluntary means. As part of a separate strike, Aslef, a union representing train drivers, has announced walkouts at three companies in rows over pay on 26 June at Hull Trains, at Greater Anglia on 23 June, and on Croydon Tramlink on 28, 29 June and 13 and 14 July.

"Passengers have been advised not to travel on trains unless necessary during strikes next week, with only a fifth of services due to run. Network Rail said about half of all rail lines will be closed when thousands of workers walk out across Britain on 21, 23 and 25 June. The services that run will start and finish earlier, from 07:30 to 18:30. There will be no trains at all in many places including north from Glasgow or Edinburgh and to Penzance in Cornwall. ""Make no mistake, the level of service we will be able to offer will be significantly compromised and passengers need to take that into account and to plan ahead and only travel if it's really necessary to do so,"" Network Rail boss Andrew Haines said. Network Rail, which owns and maintains the country's railways, said there would also be no passenger services to locations including Bournemouth in Dorset, Swansea in south Wales, Holyhead in north Wales, Chester in Cheshire and Blackpool in Lancashire. Open lines include the West Coast Main Line from London to Scotland via locations such as Birmingham and Manchester. However, with trains running for shorter hours on strike days, final departures will be much earlier than usual. For example, the last train from Manchester to London will leave at 14:47 and the last from Norwich to London at 16:00, with the last train from London to Edinburgh at 14:00. Rural and district lines will be most affected by the action. When is the rail strike and which lines will be affected? Are UK travellers heading for a summer of misery? The timetable from 20 June to 26 June is still being finalised, but the number of services is expected to be around 4,500 compared with 20,000 normally, Network Rail said. Disruption is also expected to carry over into non-strike days during the week, when only about 60% of services are expected to run. This is due to not enough staff being on shift overnight to get services ready for the following day. A number of train operators including Southeastern, TransPennine and Avanti West Coast have urged passengers to only travel by rail if necessary, while Northern has asked people ""not to travel"" on trains between Tuesday and Sunday. Several large events could be affected by the strikes, ranging from Glastonbury Festival, which runs from 22 to 26 June, to a cricket Test match between England and New Zealand taking place from 23 to 27 June. Pensioner Linda is supposed to be travelling by train from Great Yarmouth to London for a Rolling Stones concert on 25 June. She paid Â£100 per ticket but she is now unsure if there is any way for her to get there now. ""If I was to book a coach, it would cost a lot more - plus increase the travel time; two-and-a-half hours on the train becomes five to six hours on a coach,"" she told the BBC. ""And there's no way we'd get to the concert in time."" Elsewhere, Megan, a 15-year-old pupil at Bradford Grammar School, doesn't know how she will get to school. ""Both my parents work. My mum is a doctor so she's got to be in [work] really early,"" she said. ""I think we'll just have to organise lifts with someone."" ""It's just stressful. With traffic and everyone getting a lift in, it's going to be a nightmare,"" she added. Megan is worried how she'll get to school The school's bursar Homera Najib said about 300 pupils travel in by train from across Yorkshire and Leeds using the nearby Frizinghall station. She has contacted parents who have to make their own alternative arrangements to get their children to school, she said. ""We know this is going to be a real inconvenience for our pupils, especially at a time when we've got public examinations going on,"" she said. ""These are the first public examinations in two years so something like this that really throws a spanner in the works doesn't help the levels of stress."" More than 40,000 RMT union members from Network Rail and 13 train firms plan to walk out. The industrial action, which has been described as the ""biggest rail strike in modern history"", involves union members which include railway staff such as guards and signalling operators. RMT announced the strike action last week after talks over pay and redundancies fell through. On the first day of the planned strike on 21 June, London Underground RMT workers plan to walk out in a separate dispute over pensions and job losses. Andrew Haines, Network Rail chief executive, said talks with the union had ""not progressed as far as I had hoped"" and so preparations had begun for a strike. The strikes may be less disruptive for commuters, with more people now able to work from home since the pandemic. But the Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators, said ""millions of people"", including those who cannot work remotely, students sitting exams and others travelling for summer events, would still be affected. The mood music right now is that not enough progress has been made in negotiations to stop next week's walkouts. Assuming they go ahead, there will be disruption across the whole week. The involvement of Network Rail signalling staff means the number of trains that can run is particularly limited. On strike days, the signallers' replacements can only cover 12 hours, hence services will start late and finish early - where they run at all. Busy, key routes have been prioritised, meaning vast swathes of the country will be left with no services at all. Network Rail says next week's action will cost up to Â£150m in lost revenue and aborted work. The RMT union has claimed Network Rail plans to cut up to 2,500 jobs as part of a Â£2bn reduction in spending, with the proposed job cuts including workers who maintain tracks, signals and overhead lines. It also said train operators had been subject to pay freezes and changes to their terms and conditions.

"The UK government says the Northern Ireland Protocol has disrupted trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain The EU has announced new legal action against the UK government over its plans to scrap parts of the post-Brexit deal for Northern Ireland. Ministers outlined a bill on Monday aimed at unilaterally changing trade, tax and governance arrangements in the 2019 deal. The treaty was agreed by both sides but the UK says it has disrupted trade and power-sharing in Northern Ireland. But the EU says overriding parts of the deal would break international law. European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic said there was ""no legal or political justification whatsoever for unilaterally changing an international agreement"". ""So let's call a spade a spade, this is illegal,"" Mr Sefcovic said, adding that the UK's decision ""left us with no choice"" but to take legal action. Prime Minister Boris Johnson's spokesperson said his government was disappointed the EU had taken legal action and continued to favour a negotiated resolution. UK reveals plans to ditch parts of EU Brexit deal What is the Northern Ireland Protocol row about? Brexit and Northern Ireland: What does each side want? The Northern Ireland Protocol is a special arrangement that keeps Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods, avoiding a hard border with the Republic of Ireland. The arrangement ensured free trade could continue across the Irish land border, which is a sensitive issue because of the history of conflict in Northern Ireland. But the protocol brought in some new checks on goods moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and has been criticised by unionist politicians. However, the majority of politicians elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly in last month's elections support the arrangements. The European Commission said,externalit would restart legal action - paused in March 2021 - over the UK's decision to delay checks on certain goods arriving into Northern Ireland from Great Britain. The Commission also launched two new proceedings over claims the UK has failed in its obligations to share trade data and set up border inspection posts. These legal steps could eventually lead to the UK being fined under a dispute process overseen by the European Court of Justice (ECJ). But the dispute process can take months to complete and the Commission has insisted its ""door remains open"" for talks with the UK to find a resolution. The launch of legal action by the EU may sound dramatic but this is a process stretching over many months. UK legislation, to scrap parts of the protocol, will likewise take some time with the bill set to face resistance in Parliament. Regardless, the stakes have been raised this week in a dispute that has been bogged down for months. But worth noting is the emphasis from the European Commission's Maros Sefcovic that his door is open; he's saying the EU wants to talk. However the fact remains that the two sides can't even agree on quite what they should talk about. Demands by Britain for changes on tax and governance are a non-starter for the EU. There's more common ground on customs and the hope in Brussels is that they can show progress is possible within the terms of the existing treaty. But the mood isn't optimistic with diplomats frequently suggesting they think the issue is mired in Tory party politics. And if nothing changes the slow-burn passage of legal action and legislation could eventually explode into an even bigger confrontation. But as officials are keen to stress, we're not there yet. The UK government says it would prefer to agree changes with the EU, rather than act alone to scrap parts of the protocol. The government justified its move under a legal principle called the ""doctrine of necessity"", insisting the protocol was causing ""peril"" to society and politics in Northern Ireland. The UK government's chief legal adviser, Suella Braverman, told the BBC the protocol was ""adversely and seriously affecting"" Northern Ireland. She said her preferred alternative was negotiation but accused the EU of failing to do that ""meaningfully for over two years now and that's why we've regrettably been left with no option but to take these measures"". How PM's views on Northern Ireland deal changed Europe is prepping for a trade war no-one wants Northern Ireland's power-sharing administration cannot be formed without the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which has refused to take part until reforms are made to the protocol. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has urged the DUP to ""get on with it"", but the party's leader, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, has said that would depend on whether the bill to change the protocol passed into law. Earlier Philippe Lamberts, a Belgium member of the European Parliament, told the BBC the protocol changes proposed by the UK were ""about political posturing"". He said patience in Brussels ""has been tested to the extreme by Boris Johnson"". In March 2021, the EU launched legal action against the UK for delaying the full implementation of checks on some goods, including argi-food products. The infringement proceedings were paused last year but have now been resumed by the EU. If the UK government does not reply within two months, the EU could take the matter to the ECJ, which has powers to impose penalties. The EU has also launched two new actions for further alleged breaches of the protocol. These relate to alleged UK failures to carry out its obligations under the EU's sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) rules and ""provide the EU with certain trade statistics data"". The actions do not directly relate to the UK's draft legislation, with the EU reserving the right to take further action if that law ever comes into effect. ""If this draft bill becomes law, of course I cannot exclude anything,"" Mr Sefcovic said. The EU also gave more detail,externalon its own proposals to ease checks which they say can resolve issues of concern in Northern Ireland. These include an expanded trusted trader arrangement covering more products and companies and a cut to customs administration. Mr Sefcovic said the proposals were ""all about simplification"" and at the news conference, attempted to demonstrate this by holding up three documents. ""These are the three pages that need to be filled. Not 300, not 30, three,"" he said. Echoing the UK prime minister's Brexit rhetoric, Mr Sefcovic said the proposals were ""oven-ready"", while adding this was not an ""unconditional offer"". Maros Sefcovic said the EU's proposals would simplify administration But the UK has previously rejected the EU's proposals saying they would make things worse, and if differences are not resolved, there are fears that the row over the protocol could trigger a trade war, which involves putting up barriers to the exchange of goods. A trade war could increase costs for consumers, possibly compounding pressure on household budgets driven by inflation at 40-year highs.

"People with a worrying cough, problems swallowing or blood in their urine will soon be able to be referred for scans and checks by a pharmacist, rather than having to wait to see their GP. The new pilot scheme, in England, aims to diagnose more cancers early, when there is a better chance of a cure. High Street pharmacies will be funded to refer customers for the checks. The NHS will also send out more ""roaming trucks"" to perform on-the-spot scans in the community. Lung-scanner vans driven to locations, including supermarket car parks and football stadiums, have already resulted in more people having checks. Now, some liver lorries will join them. About 6,100 people a year are diagnosed with liver cancer - the number has doubled over the past decade and is expected to continue to rise. About half of all cancers are diagnosed early - but the NHS wants this to be at least three-quarters. It also plans to offer Jewish people genetic screening - as up to one in 40 has Brca mutations, linked to a higher risk of breast, ovarian and prostate cancers, compared with one in 400 in the general population. NHS England boss Amanda Pritchard will tell the NHS ConfedExpo conference, in Liverpool: ""We want to make it as easy as possible for those most at risk to get vital, lifesaving tests. ""These plans have the power to truly transform the way we find and treat cancer - and ultimately spare thousands of patients and their families from avoidable pain and loss."" Health and Social Care Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""Ensuring patients can access diagnosis and treatment easily in their communities and on High Streets is a fundamental part of our 10-Year Cancer Plan."" Dr Anthony Cunliffe, national clinical adviser for primary care, at Macmillan Cancer Support, said: ""Doctors and nurses are working tirelessly to diagnose and treat the tens of thousands of people entering a very busy cancer care system. ""This pilot will give people the opportunity to access more trained professionals in their community to get symptoms investigated."" Michelle Mitchell, from Cancer Research UK, said: ""By changing the way people engage with the health service, we have the potential to help diagnose more cancers at an earlier, more treatable stage. ""We look forward to seeing how these efforts will support the NHS's ambitious early diagnosis targets.""

The government justified its move under a legal principle called the ""doctrine of necessity"", insisting the protocol was causing ""peril"" to society and politics in Northern Ireland. The UK government's chief legal adviser, Suella Braverman, told the BBC the protocol was ""adversely and seriously affecting"" Northern Ireland. She said her preferred alternative was negotiation but accused the EU of failing to do that ""meaningfully for over two years now and that's why we've regrettably been left with no option but to take these measures"". How PM's views on Northern Ireland deal changed Europe is prepping for a trade war no-one wants Northern Ireland's power-sharing administration cannot be formed without the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which has refused to take part until reforms are made to the protocol. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has urged the DUP to ""get on with it"", but the party's leader, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, has said that would depend on whether the bill to change the protocol passed into law. Earlier Philippe Lamberts, a Belgium member of the European Parliament, told the BBC the protocol changes proposed by the UK were ""about political posturing"". He said patience in Brussels ""has been tested to the extreme by Boris Johnson"". In March 2021, the EU launched legal action against the UK for delaying the full implementation of checks on some goods, including argi-food products. The infringement proceedings were paused last year but have now been resumed by the EU. If the UK government does not reply within two months, the EU could take the matter to the ECJ, which has powers to impose penalties. The EU has also launched two new actions for further alleged breaches of the protocol. These relate to alleged UK failures to carry out its obligations under the EU's sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) rules and ""provide the EU with certain trade statistics data"". The actions do not directly relate to the UK's draft legislation, with the EU reserving the right to take further action if that law ever comes into effect. ""If this draft bill becomes law, of course I cannot exclude anything,"" Mr Sefcovic said. The EU also gave more detail,externalon its own proposals to ease checks which they say can resolve issues of concern in Northern Ireland. These include an expanded trusted trader arrangement covering more products and companies and a cut to customs administration. Mr Sefcovic said the proposals were ""all about simplification"" and at the news conference, attempted to demonstrate this by holding up three documents. ""These are the three pages that need to be filled. Not 300, not 30, three,"" he said. Echoing the UK prime minister's Brexit rhetoric, Mr Sefcovic said the proposals were ""oven-ready"", while adding this was not an ""unconditional offer"". Maros Sefcovic said the EU's proposals would simplify administration But the UK has previously rejected the EU's proposals saying they would make things worse, and if differences are not resolved, there are fears that the row over the protocol could trigger a trade war, which involves putting up barriers to the exchange of goods. A trade war could increase costs for consumers, possibly compounding pressure on household budgets driven by inflation at 40-year highs.

"Tenants could face less choice and higher prices if new rules drive landlords out of the market Landlords said they fear many will sell up and stop renting homes due to Wales' new housing rules. Longer ""no fault"" eviction periods are part of anumber of changes, set to be introduced in December. The Welsh government said it would do all it could to ensure landlords had time to prepare. But tenants have said having six months, instead of two, to find a new home if they were evicted would ease the pressure on them. Landlords have said ""uncertainty"" around the new rules could make some sell on and create a ""housing crisis"" for tenants. It comes as Shelter Cymru said it wasseeing twice the number of tenants being subjected to these evictions. Tenants 'let down' by no-fault eviction rule delay Mum asked landlord to evict her as rent rises Tim Holmes from Aberystwyth, Ceredigion, said he was in a ""state of shock"" when he received a no fault eviction notice. ""I felt I was in a fairly good place up until I received the notice [and] when I did, things started to unravel a bit,"" he said. Tim Holmes said ""things started to unravel"" when he was given a ""no fault"" notice with two months' warning Mr Holmes said facing eviction with just two months notice under the current rules meant tenants could ""never quite feel secure"". ""I think it's profoundly debilitating psychologically,"" he said. His case has yet to be concluded. Meanwhile, Claire Green, from Miskin, Rhondda Cynon Taf, said she could no longer take the ""risk"" of being a landlord. The single mum said she had already sold several of her properties. Renting law brings in six-month eviction notice Buying a home an 'unachievable dream' for many She blamed the Renting Homes (Wales) Act for placing too much risk on landlords. ""There are a number of clauses coming in which could potentially send some people with a smaller portfolio like myself bankrupt,"" she said. ""A couple of properties, I was making very little profit on,"" she added. ""I didn't feel confident enough to be continuing to self-manage and I just thought I can't do this anymore."" Landlord Claire Green says new housing rules have forced her to sell homes Claire said many smaller landlords are worried about changing the notice period a landlord must give for a no-fault eviction, from two months to six. ""It's not a nice thing to have to give your tenant notice, however, there are situations that landlords find themselves in, be it through a divorce or financial difficulty and other situations, where they do need to give notice,"" she said. She added that landlords are having to adapt to complete changes in how contracts work. ""When I found out that I was also going to have to replace that straightforward tenancy agreement with a lengthy contract, it was a no-brainer for me because I just haven't got the time. ""I work full-time, I'm a single mother and I haven't got the time to be doing this kind of additional work."" She said even though she had not needed to issue no-fault eviction notices to any tenants, she might have to consider it in the future in order to offload properties. Chris Coates, who runs a Facebook group for more than 600 landlords in Wales, said he was seeing discussions about selling up and quitting on an ""almost daily basis"". Chris Coates says many landlords are anxious about the new rules ""In my experience the vast majority of landlords are good, decent people that want to do the right thing,"" he said. ""There's a lot of uncertainty right now and a lot of anxiety among landlords. ""My fear is that there are going to be a lot of landlords who decide to sell and there's going to be a reduction in the amount of rental stock. ""Landlords could also be so anxious about who they let their property to that it will affect the ability of our most vulnerable tenants to find somewhere to live."" Two types of contracts, one for community landlords and their tenants and one for private landlords and their tenants Landlords must ensure all properties are fit for human habitation, including natural lighting, working smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, and anti-damp standards The minimum period for no-fault evictions is being extended from two to six months for new tenants from December If a tenant breaches their contract the minimum notice period is one month or shorter in cases of anti-social behaviour or serious rent arrears The Welsh government had planned to introduce the new housing law in July, but that has now been postponed until December, in part to allow more time for landlords to prepare. Changes apply to social landlords as much as the private sector, and the head of an umbrella body for housing providers said the Welsh government was told it was ""impossible"" for them to implement the new law by the original date. Katie Dalton, Director of Cymorth Cymru, said the sector had been promised that documentation and regulations would be available six months before the implementation of the Renting Homes Act. She told Walescast, the BBC Wales politics podcast, that this had instead been ""drip fed over the last few months"" - with some published this month. ""At the implementation date that was planned, mid-July, that's really too late for social landlords to be training all of their staff, teams, setting up new IT systems, and making sure all of those new contracts are in place."" ""That's why social landlords, local authorities wrote to the Welsh government and said we're in an impossible situation - we're really finding it impossible to implement on this timescale."" She said social landlords had been dealing with a ""huge amount of pressure"" over the last couple of years, with nearly 8,000 people in temporary accommodation seeking homes, and 1,000 people to housing authorities as homeless every month. At the moment roughly 500 people a month can be moved into permanent accommodation. With Ukrainian refugees as well, there are around 10,000 people trying to find a permanent home. Shelter Cymru said the delay had been a ""great surprise"" with no-fault evictions doubling over the past 12 months. ""We felt it was a real blow for tenants,"" said Jennie Bibbings, the charity's head of campaigns. Jennie Bibbings said delays in introducing the new laws surprised Shelter Cymru ""There are such great benefits in this legislation and we have all been waiting for such a long time for it. ""In our casework, no-fault evictions have doubled over the last 12 months,"" she said. ""From what I hear a lot of them are linked to house sales."" She explained the ""toxic"" combination of a UK house price bubble and major rules may be ""extra impetus to some landlords who are already thinking of getting out of the game."" Carl Sully, 28, said it would have made a ""massive difference"" to his young family if they had six months, rather than two, to find a new home after being issued with an eviction notice by their landlord in Newport. ""Me and my partner both work full-time including overtime and putting in extra hours,"" he said. ""We have struggled to find anything in our price range, as well as the bond and deposit, on such short notice. ""It has had a massive strain on our mental health, family and money worries as we have two young sons to provide for. It was scary."" Carl Sully and partner Sian Davies said having six months rather than two to find a new home would have made a ""massive"" difference Carl said his family eventually needed help from social housing teams and were ""lucky"" to find somewhere in time. Research from theBevan Foundation,externalrecently suggested that a rising number of people in Wales were at risk of homelessness because of a shortage of affordable properties. Data collected from 1,775 rental adverts across Wales indicated only 24, or just 1.4%, were at a price fully covered by the housing allowance. There were previously thought to be 130,000 landlords but Rent Smart Wales, launched by the Welsh government in 2015 to tackle bad landlords, said the real figure is thought to be only 90,000. Jeanne Fry-Thomas, a director at Bidmead Cook estate agents in Blaenau Gwent, said many landlords were ""withdrawing from the private rental market"". ""Many of these landlords rent to people on housing benefit,"" she said. ""The private rental sector is so bad the number of properties available is dropping all the time. That's why we are seeing rents go up so much, it's down to supply and demand."" A Welsh government spokesperson said: ""This type of large reform happens very rarely and we want to do all we can to ensure landlords have enough time to make the necessary preparations and get things right for tenants."" The spokesperson said alongside the Renting Homes Act the Welsh government has launched a scheme offering incentives to owners who do not want to actively manage their property so they can lease it to their local authority instead.

"Nurse Johanna Black retired after 37 years' service but is back doing her old role as part of the NHS staff bank A nursing union has warned some nurses are retiring when they do not want to because of a lack of flexibility from Scotland's health boards. Latest figures show nearly one in 10 nursing and midwifery posts are vacant. The Royal College of Nursing Scotland says health boards failing to accommodate staff who want to change their working patterns rather than leave is making the problem worse. Scottish ministers say they are working to increase flexibility for nurses. The overall number of vacant nursing and midwifery posts across Scotland at 31 March this year was 6,209. This is up from 4,495 at the same point in 2021, an increase of more than 38%. Pandemic has left NHS staff completely knackered Can video calls ease the pressure on Scotland's A&Es? More than 550,000 on Scottish hospital waiting lists RCN Scotland says the issue of retaining staff is equally as important as hiring new people to fill these vacancies. The union is concerned about a ""retire and rehire"" trend where nurses leave their posts and then join staffing banks in order to get the reduced hours or flexibility they want. RCN Scotland director Colin Pullman said: ""People are wanting to continue in a flexible way but, for whatever reason, these opportunities are not being looked at so we're missing the opportunity to retain expertise and knowledge in the service. ""We just need to be a bit more creative, work with people and make sure their work-life balance is right. ""We have over 6,000 vacancies in the NHS so employers need to work with individuals who are either retiring or wish to come back into service, to give them the flexible option that they are looking for."" Nursing and Midwifery Council data shows the number of people leaving its permanent register in Scotland has increased for the first time after two years of decline. In 2021/22 a total of 2,750 people left the council's register, a 16.3% increase on the tally for 2020/21. NHS workforce statistics show spending on bank nurses between 2014 and 2022 increased by 36% to Â£321m, with spend on agency nurses more than doubling (126.2%) to Â£88.9m in the same period. Much of this increase was as a result of the pandemic where there was more reliance on temporary staff. Speaking on BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotland programmeon Monday, Health Secretary Humza Yousaf said the Scottish government and health boards were ""putting in a lot of effort"" to improve conditions for staff who he said had beenleft ""completely knackered"" from dealing with the pandemic. He said: ""Recruitment is one side of the story, the other side of the story is retention. ""I have spoken to a number of nurses who tell me that having worked 30 years in the NHS they are really struggling to stay on. ""I have asked my chief nursing officer to look at whether we can be more flexible right across the board in terms of working patterns and working shifts."" Johanna Black worked for the NHS for nearly four decades and was a senior charge nurse in a community mental health team Johanna Black was overwhelmed with the cards and warm messages she got when she retired from her role as a community nurse in East Dunbartonshire last year. The 55-year-old had worked in the NHS for 37 years so was in a position to start receiving her NHS pension and look for another nursing role with reduced hours. But it was not what she wanted to do. ""If it hadn't been for Covid I would have kept my job,"" she said. ""I loved my job, worked in a great team and was really proud of the service we provided, especially in the pandemic, but I would say the past two years have impacted my health. ""I think I may have been able to negotiate a slight reduction in my hours but financially I wasn't in a position to do that, so my only option was to retire so I could pick up work with less hours that I could cope with."" Johanna with her leaving presents when she retired from her role with NHS Forth Valley Johanna has ended up temporarily back in the same senior charge nurse role she retired from, with reduced hours, but thinks the future will involve doing bank nursing shifts. The 55-year-old thinks there ""should be more options"" for NHS staff in her position as she argues ""a lot of people still have a lot to give"". She said: ""I think people, if they have various options open to them, they might not choose to leave."" Johanna said she was not critical of NHS Forth Valley but added that all of Scotland's health boards ""need to think what can be done to retain that experience."" The Scottish government said staffing across NHS Scotland was at a record high. Health Secretary Humza Yousaf said: ""Since 2006 we have increased the number of qualified nurses and midwives by over 5,500, or by 13.7%; the number of medical and dental consultants by over 2,000, or by 63.2%, and the number of allied health professionals (excluding paramedics) by over 2,000, or by 26.3%. ""The latest workforce statistics also showed that nursing and midwifery vacancies have started to reduce in the last quarter. ""We have recruited more than 1,000 additional healthcare support staff since last October and almost 200 registered nurses from overseas to help address the unprecedented challenges facing the NHS."" He said work was ongoing to enhance NHS workforce levels and support health boards to fill posts. Mr Yousaf added: ""This is backed by our Â£1bn NHS recovery plan which introduced a range of direct workforce investments and new measures to support health boards' capacity for both domestic and international recruitment.""

"The first of two payments to help the poorest households with the cost of living will hit people's bank accounts from 14 July, the government says. More than eight million UK homes on benefits will receive Â£326 by the end of July, with a second payment of Â£324 set to follow in the autumn. It comes as part of a Â£37bn government package to help families as energy, food and fuel bills soar. The consumer group Which? said the cash would ""bring relief to many"". But policy director Rocio Concha added: ""The success of these measures will ultimately be judged by whether financial help is getting to the most vulnerable in time to help them through this cost-of-living crisis.""

Bills had already risen by Â£700 on average in April. The two cost-of-living payments - worth Â£650 in total - willbe paid automatically to anyone in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Irelandwho receive Universal Credit, tax credits, pension credit and other means-tested benefits. To be eligible for the first instalment, people must have been entitled to the benefits by 25 May. When might the inflation rate come down? Fuel cost: How to save petrol and diesel The government said the cash would be tax-free and not count towards someone's benefit cap. ""We have a responsibility to protect those who are paying the highest price for rising inflation, and we are stepping up to help,"" said Chancellor Rishi Sunak. Karl Handscomb, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation, a think tank focusing on people on lower incomes, said it was the ""right call to target flat-rate payments at low-income households"", although this approach did contain some ""rough edges"". ""The support will go much further for single people than for those with large families. And the fact that they don't automatically go to new claimants means that anyone claiming benefits for the first time since the chancellor's speech - for example if they've recently lost their job - will not get this July payment and will only get the second payment, due in the autumn,"" he added. The date of the second cost-of-living payment will be announced soon, the government says. It announced the policy in May as part of a suite of measures to tackle the soaring living costs. This followed intense pressure on the government to do more to help people. All homes in the UK, regardless of how well off they are, are set to get Â£400 for help with energy bills this autumn, along with a previously announced Â£150 council tax rebate. There will also be a separate Â£300 payment for pensioners, and a Â£150 payment for disabled people, both of which can be paid on top of the Â£650 cost-of-living payment.

"France's President Macron says European leaders are supportive of Ukraine gaining ""immediate"" candidate status to join the EU Macron, Germany's Olaf Scholz and Italy's Mario Draghi were earlier welcomed to the Presidential Palace in Kyiv by President Zelensky The EU leaders inspected war damage on a visit to the town of Irpin which Russian troops occupied at the war's start Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov defends Russiaâs actions in Ukraine, in an interview with the BBC Lavrov also criticises the UK for its policy towards Russia Meanwhile, 10,000 civilians are trapped in the embattled eastern city of Severodonetsk, a regional governor says We're pausing our live coverage of the war in Ukraine for now. Today's updates were brought to you by Paul Gribben, Nathan Williams, Holly Wallis, Catherine Evans, Emily McGarvey, James Clarke, Chris Giles, James FitzGerald and Alex Kleiderman. President Zelensky welcomed France's President Macron to Kyiv Thanks for joining today's coverage of the war in Ukraine. Here's a quick look back at some of Thursday's key developments. Kyiv's EU bid backed by four leaders  Lavrov defends invasion  Other headlines  Russia's aggression in Ukraine is a game-changer, Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has said. Stoltenberg has been speaking in Brussels where defence ministers from member countries of the military alliance and a handful of other allies have been meeting to discuss the situation in Ukraine. He says progress has been made in many areas and, in a meeting with the Ukrainian defence minister last night, they discussed the ""imperative need for our continued support as Russia conducts a relentless war of attrition against Ukraine"". Stoltenberg says Ukraine's allies have announced additional assistance, ""including much-needed heavy weapons and long range systems"" and also discussed plans to support the country for the longer term and to step up Nato's ""presence, capabilities and readiness"". The Russian Orthodox Church has dismissed sanctions against its leader, Patriarch Kirill, imposed by Britain for his support of Moscow's military intervention in Ukraine. It targeted the 75-year-old cleric and ally of President Vladimir Putin two weeks after the EU dropped him from their own sanctions list after opposition from Hungary. ""Attempts to intimidate the primate of the Russian Church with something or to force him to renounce his views are senseless, absurd and unpromising,"" church spokesman Vladimir Legoyda said on Telegram. He added that the Church was ""the last bridge, a means of communication, which they are trying to destroy for some reason. ""This may be necessary only for those political forces that have the escalation of conflict and the alienation of peace as their important goal,"" Legoyda said. Vitaliy ShevchenkoReporting from Moscow Officials installed by Moscow in recently occupied areas of Ukraine say newly-born children there will be given Russian citizenship. This will apply to babies born in the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions since the start of the Russian invasion on 24 February, state-run news agency RIA Novosti reports. Currently, most of the two regions are under Russian occupation. The deputy head of the Russia-backed administration in the Kherson region, Kirill Stremousov,told RIA Novosti,externalon 16 February that newborns will be given Russian citizenship ""automatically"". Vladimir Rogov, a member of the Russia-backed administration in occupied parts of the Zaporizhzhia region,told RIA Novosti,externalthat the instruction to give Russian citizenship to newborns came from Vladimir Putin's office. In May, Putin issued a decree simplifying the procedure of obtaining Russian citizenship for residents of the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions.The EU called it,externalpart of Russia's attempts to ""forcefully integrate"" parts of Ukrainian territory and said it will not recognise Russian passports issued there. The Russian military has been focusing its efforts on the Bakhmut area of the Donetsk region and a continued assault on Severodonetsk, Ukraine's General Staff said in a Facebook update earlier today. ""The enemy keeps trying to establish full control over the city of Severodonetsk. They are storming the city, and the fighting continues,"" the report says. The Russian army has opened fire on Ukrainian units in various areas in or near Severodonetsk and shelled a number of towns in the Bakhmut area - but also towns and cities in other parts of the country too. Ukrainian soldiers ""uncovered and destroyed an enemy sabotage and reconnaissance group"" on the route between Yehorivka and Shevchenko in the Donetsk Region, the General Staff said. Macron speaking alongside Ukraine's President Zelensky earlier French arms manufacturer Nexter has been asked by President Macron to increase its production of Caesar howitzer weapons, a source close to the defence ministry tells Reuters. Nexter is being urged to work in a ""wartime"" mode, the source says. During a visit to Kyiv earlier, Macron pledged to send Ukraine another six Caesars on top of the 12 previously delivered. Separately, Macron says it's ""up to Ukraine to decide"" whether to accept any territorial concessions with a view to ending the war - speaking to French TV station TF1 after today's visit. Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv The sister of the
Moroccan man who has been sentenced to death by a Russian proxy court in
eastern Ukraine says she feels his story is being ignored - and that he may be
forgotten. Brahim Saadoune was
sentenced alongside Britons Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner, who have received
much more coverage. Saadoune, 21, was studying in Ukraine but signed up to fight in the defence of Mariupol. When he surrendered
- he was put on trial, along with the other two, not as a soldier but a
mercenary. âAt first, when they captured all of them, then it was like different news about every person,â
Imane Saadoune says. âThere wasn't much
attention on my brotherâ¦ he was left aside a little bit.â The three men do
have a chance to appeal but the separatists have said they see no reason not to
put them to death. It has been left to Brahim's friends to campaign for his life. âHe has a lot of
support. His friends, they are real friends, just starting many campaigns for
him. I just want to tell him that he is loved. He's really loved.â Morocco's main national rights body has now condemned the sentencing, calling for Brahim Saadoune to be extradited to Morocco. Meanwhile, state-run MAP news agency is reporting comments by Morocco's diplomatic sources noting that he was being held by a body not recognised by either the UN or Morocco. Brahim Saadoune (R) was sentenced with Aiden Aslin (L) and Shaun Pinner (C) More now from the BBC interview with Russia's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov. Lavrov has insisted that courts in an
area of eastern Ukraine run by Russian-backed separatists are truly independent. He was being questioned about two Britons
recently given death sentences by a court in the self-proclaimed Donetsk
Peopleâs Republic â after being captured while fighting alongside Ukrainian
troops. Lavrov says he is ânot interestedâ in whether the West views
Russia as responsible for their fate. âI am only interested in international law,â he says. âAccording
to international law, mercenaries are not recognised as combatants.â The families of Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner deny that the
two men were mercenaries, instead saying they are long-serving members of the
Ukrainian military. Challenged with that claim, Lavrov responds âthis should be
decided by a court"". President Zelensky met European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen in April Ukraine's hopes of swiftly joining the European Union received a boost earlier, as the leaders of the EU's three largest economies agreed during a visit to Kyiv that the country should get ""immediate"" candidate status. But that would be just the start of what's expected to be a long journey towards accession for Ukraine. The country's candidacy itself is something that would need to be agreed by all 27 of the EU's member states, following today's positive signals from Germany, France, Italy and Romania. That could happen during an EU summit on 23-24 June. There would then follow a negotiation stage, during which Ukraine could be asked to agree to reforms. These could see Kyiv asked to sign up to a set of values that align with the EU's own. It would likely be asked to stamp out corruption; an issue for which the country was notorious before the invasion. Other hopeful joiners, including a number of Balkan countries, have been stuck at the negotiating stage for years. And EU officials - as well as France's President Macron, who visited Kyiv today - have previously cautioned that it could even take decades for the process to be completed in Ukraine's case.

Olha Stefanishyna met France's President Macron and others earlier Ukraine's deputy prime minister says warm scenes during a visit by leaders of four EU nations earlier represent a ""historic breakthrough"" - but warns that Western countries have shown a ""gap [...] between promises and actions"" so far. Those leaders ""now know the price"" of not delivering the right weapons to Ukraine in a timely way, Olha Stefanishyna tells the BBC, in reference to the group's trip to the decimated city of Irpin. Following their visit, a refusal to grant Ukraine candidate status to join the European Union would cause ""enormous frustration amongst Ukrainian people,"" she tells Stephen Sackur on the HARDtalk programme.

French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi spoke at a news conference in Kyiv, where they all reaffirmed their support for Ukraine joining the European Union. The White House says it is ""working very hard to learn more"" about two US citizens who are missing in Ukraine. Alexander Drueke, 39, and Andy Huynh, 27, both from Alabama, are feared by their families to have been captured after reportedly volunteering to fight as part of a Ukrainian army unit. Reuters reports the pair are thought to have been involved in an operation around the Kharkiv region, but did not return. They are said to have been out of contact with their relatives since 8 June. US officials say there is no confirmation that the two men have been captured by Russian forces. During questioning over the reports on Wednesday, a National Security Council spokesman advised Americans against travelling to Ukraine - urging them to find other ways to support the country. This video can not be played Russia's foreign minister has again defended Moscowâs
actions in neighbouring Ukraine, during an exclusive interview with the BBC. âRussia is not squeaky clean,â Sergei Lavrov admits in
answer to a question from Steve Rosenberg. âRussia is what it is. And we are
not ashamed of showing who we are.â The minister claimed the United Nations is âbeing used to
amplify fake news from the West,â after being read quotes from a UN report
detailing alleged Russian war crimes. Of the invasion itself, Lavrov says: âWe had absolutely no
other way of explaining to the West that dragging Ukraine into Nato was a
criminal act.â Russia has opposed the eastward expansion of Nato, a
30-member military alliance of Western nations. Read Steve Rosenberg's story here. Sergei Lavrov has been speaking to the BBC's Steve Rosenberg Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has dared the UK
government to try to âdefeatâ Russia over its actions in Ukraine. In an exclusive interview with the BBCâs Russia Editor, Steve
Rosenberg, he says he doesnât think thereâs âroom for manoeuvre anymoreâ in
terms of relations between Russia and the UK. âBoth [UK PM Boris] Johnson and [Foreign Secretary Liz] Truss say openly that we
should defeat Russia, we should force Russia to its knees,â says Lavrov. âGo on then, do it!â he adds. Lavrov goes on to accuse the UK of âonce again sacrificing
the interests of its people for the sake of political ambitions.â He continues: âTheir politicians think only about the next
election and nothing else.â Like other Western nations, the UK has provided Ukraine with
weapons to fight Russian invaders â and has also targeted Moscow with
sanctions. Jonathan BealeBBC defence correspondent Britainâs Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has said âthe momentum is still in Ukraineâs favourâ in its fight with Russia. âThat doesnât mean the big Russian war machine is going backwards,â he said, âbut it is not advancing according to their plans"". In an interview with the BBC at a Nato ministerial meeting in Brussels, Mr Wallace said that in some places, Russian artillery outnumbered Ukraineâs by as much as 20 to one. But he said that western nations were now sending more heavy weapons to address the imbalance. Britain has already announced it will be sending Ukraine a small number of multiple rocket launchers â taken from the British Armyâs stock. But Mr Wallace confirmed that Britain would also be  sending 20 self-propelled  artillery  guns to Ukraine. Those artillery guns have been bought from a Belgian arms company to send directly to Ukraine. Mr Wallace said that Britain was still determined to help lead the contributions of weapons to Ukraine. But he said âwe donât have everything in our armed forcesâ. The defence secretary said western nations were also learning lessons about their own âvulnerabilitiesâ from the war in Ukraine - one of them was the need for stocks of ammunition. He added that one of the limiting factors for supplying Ukraine with weapons was âwhat people have on their shelvesâ. Joel GunterReporting from Momotove, near Kharkiv In a field about six miles from the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, the J9 army unit is doing its grim job - digging up bodies of Russian soldiers. In a shallow mass grave under a tree, there are six dead, piled on top of one another in a rough heap. No one here knows who buried them - local residents or retreating Russians. The bodies are swarmed by flies and the smell is overpowering, but the members of the J9 unit and the two diggers who help them are unfazed. They are used to it. The J9 soldiers and gravediggers, including Yurii (front right), carry the bodies out Yurii, one of the gravediggers, got this job after he found five bodies buried in his own garden in a different village, and called the J9 unit to dig them up. ""I helped them dig and they liked the way I worked, because I was a gravedigger before, so now I'm helping them,"" he said. That means going from village to village, every day, exhuming bodies - Ukrainians and Russians. These dead Russians will be taken to the morgue, sampled for identification, and eventually swapped for Ukrainian dead. Yurii served in the army in the Soviet Union. ""Someone is waiting for these men â their fathers and mothers, children,"" he said. âI understand that.â Nick BeakeReporting from Kyiv On the fringe of the joint press conference, I
caught up with Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine's foreign minister. I asked him whether the latest weapons
announced today are too little, too late considering weâre told up to as many
as 200 Ukrainian soldiers are being lost every day in Donbas. ""The announcements of new weapons
delivered to Ukraine should be made on a weekly basis. And these weapons should
be delivered in sufficient quantities. This is the reality. We appreciate
everything that has been done, we do not complain,"" he told me. ""But the truth is that we're still
outnumbered when it comes to artillery, multiple launch rocket systems and
defence systems, and we cannot make any big progress until we strike a balance
with Russia in the numbers on these three positions. ""So do not get me wrong. I'm not complaining. I appreciate
everything that has been done. I appreciate these announcements, but just to
strike the balance, as I said, these announcements should be made a weekly
basis and in sufficient quantities."" There was a joint press conference with the leaders from Ukraine, Germany, France, Italy and Romania We've been hearing from Ukraine's president and the leaders of Germany, France, Italy and Romania who've been in Kyiv for talks. Here's what we learned from their joint press conference:  Ukraine is ""ready to work"" to become
a full European Union member, President Zelensky said after meeting four
visiting EU leaders for talks in Kyiv. At a news conference in the Ukrainian capital
French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Italian Prime
Minister Mario Draghi and Romanian President Klaus Iohannis all publicly backed
Kyiv's bid to join the bloc. EU leaders are holding a summit next week at
which Kyiv's application to become a candidate for membership is likely to be
given a green light. Zelensky said: ""Ukrainians have already earned the right to
go down this road and obtain this candidate status."" Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.9999987
"The decision has been taken not to try and protect Happisburgh in north Norfolk from sea level rises Nearly 200,000 properties in England may have to be abandoned due to rising sea levels by 2050, a report says. It looks at where water will cause most damage and whether defences are technically and financially feasible. There is consensus among scientists that decades of sea level rise are inevitable and the government has said that not all properties can be saved. About a third of England's coast will be put under pressure by sea level rise, the report says. ""It just won't be possible to hold the line all around the coast,"" says the report's author Paul Sayers, an expert on flood and coastal risks, adding that tough decisions will have to be made about what it is realistic to protect. ""These are the places we are going to hold, and these are the places we're not going to hold, so we need that honest debate around how we're going to do that and support communities where they are affected."" The study is published in the journal Ocean and Coastal Management. Sayers' report lists the South West, the North West and East Anglia among parts of England with the highest number of properties at risk of flooding. Raised sea levels not only increase the risk of flooding on the coast and in estuaries but also accelerate coastal erosion through larger more powerful waves. The study for the first time looks at places where the costs of improving defences may be too high or technically impossible. It found that by 2050 assuming a conservative sea level rise caused by temperature increases of 2C by 2100, up to 160,000 properties are at risk of needing relocation. That's in addition to between 30,000 and 35,000 properties that have already been identified as at risk. ""There's no real engineering limit to how well we can protect ourselves, so for London for example, the Thames barrier and the all the walls and embankments, they continue to be raised in response to sea level rise."" Sayers explained to BBC News on the beach at Happisburgh in north Norfolk. ""There's not going to be money, under current funding rules to protect everyone."" Happisburgh, a small picturesque old Anglo-Saxon village with a distinct red-and-white-striped lighthouse, is unlikely to receive any more money for sea defences. And its coast is already crumbling fast. Bryony Nierop-Reading has already been made homeless by coastal erosion once The ground under Bryony Nierop-Reading's bungalow fell into the sea in 2013 and there's now a safety barrier across her street which ends abruptly at the top of the cliff. ""Road Closed"" the red-and-white sign says. On it are handwritten dates and numbers where for the past six months the 77-year-old has been documenting the retreating tarmac. ""Eight metres in December 2021, it's 3.4 metres now,"" she says with a sigh. Bryony has good reason to monitor the erosion. When her bungalow was demolished, she chose to move just 50m up the road to a house that is also destined to crumble into the sea. ""It'll probably last until 2030,"" she says. Bryony does not accept the decision from the district council that Happisburgh should not be protected by new sea defences. She points toa Â£20m project just up the coastwhere large amounts of sand have been dumped on the shore to protect a gas terminal. ""It's just such a feeble and unpatriotic attitude,"" she says. ""I think that we should be saying that our country, our land, our agricultural land, is sufficiently important that we need to divert funding to it."" Bryony has launched an organisation to try and attract renewed interest in some new sea defences. ""It's the Save Happisburgh Action Group,"" she tells me. ""The name Shag makes people snigger but a shag is a seabird who has to fight for survival against impossible odds. That's very appropriate for Happisburgh."" Bryony's view is not universally held in Happisburgh. And hers is not the only campaign group. Malcolm Kerby helped organise the ""roll-back"" of homes at risk from the sea ""The sea is very powerful. Even more powerful than Boris Johnson,"" says the booming voice of Malcolm Kirby, one of the founders of Happisburgh's Coastal Action Group. Malcolm is 81 and has been involved in finding a solution for Happisburgh's erosion problem for more than 20 years. Back in 2009, he helped devise a government-backed ""Pathfinder"" project whereby the owners of homes that were about to fall into the sea were offered market price by the government and helped to resettle further inland. He calls it ""roll-back"". ""You either commit to spending billions over an extended period,"" he says. ""Or you say OK in the light of what's coming with climate change and sea level rise we will do a properly managed withdrawal and look after the people as we go."" Parts of Happisburgh have already crumbled into the sea Happisburgh's Pathfinder project is now being looked at as an example of how the rest of the UK might adapt. Along with East Yorkshire, north Norfolk has been chosen to be part of a Â£36m Coastal Transition Accelerator Programme which will look at a ideas such as establishing ""green buffer zones"" between communities and facilitating the ""managed transition of communities from high-risk land"". At Happisburgh's pub, landlord Clive Stockton says the realisation that the village will slowly fall into the sea casts a long shadow. ""As soon as the decision is made that there is no defence, then all normal commercial transactions, whether it be commercial loans for businesses or insurance stop existing,"" he says. ""The problem doesn't just start when the properties start to go over the cliff."" Clive believes there's a middle ground and would like to see a mix  of relocation and defence to slow the sea's advance. ""Inevitable is a long way away,"" he says. ""Climate change was created by the whole human race over the last 40 or 50 years. Why should a small proportion of people on the coast pay the price for that?""
