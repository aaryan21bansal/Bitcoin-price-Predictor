The NYPD tweeted on Sunday that arrangements were being made to return the ring to the pair, who are from the UK. CCTV images showed the couple unsuccessfully trying to retrieve the piece of jewellery. But police officers later managed to rescue and clean it.

His fiancÃ©e, who police confirmed said ""Yes"", puts her hands to her face when she realises what has happened. She crouches down next to him, trying to help but they are unsuccessful. The man then lies down on the floor by the grate, trying to reach the piece of jewellery but again they are unable to retrieve it. Officers from the New York Police Department clearly have a romantic side and, more importantly, access to the grate, so could get it out quite easily. Earlier, they had put out a plea for the man and woman to come forward. Later on Sunday they released an image of the cleaned-up ring on their Twitter account with the caption: ""Here's a photo of the ring our officers recovered (and cleaned!)

"John proposed to girlfriend Daniella in New York - but a short while later they lost the engagement ring Be it fate, or a stroke of good luck, Daniella Anthony and John Drennan are soon to be reunited with their precious piece of jewellery. ""We are so happy, we can't believe it,"" the young couple said after discovering their lost engagement ringhad been found. The pair, from Peterborough, had flown to New York to celebrate their 10-year dating anniversary. Mr Drennan said he'd put a lot of thought into the proposal. Speaking to BBC News on Sunday evening, he said he had carried the ring around in his pocket for two days before finding the right moment. ""I want to clarify that I did not propose over a grate in Times Square - that's where we lost it,"" Mr Drennan said. NYPD find UK couple who lost ring in drain Lost gold ring found on carrot Man told to repay ex for engagement rings The momentous occasion had taken place in Central Park a few hours earlier. ""The time was right. There were autumn leaves everywhere and not many people."" Daniella said yes straight away but they both knew the ring wasn't the right size. ""I tried to tell John it was too big, but he insisted I wear it,"" Ms Anthony said. ""I told her it was fine. I was just so happy to finally call her my fiancÃ©e after all this time,"" Mr Drennan added. The happy couple decided to grab a bite to eat and see the Christmas Spectacular in Times Square when the ring escaped. ""We were walking back to the hotel. I can still visualise the ring. Bouncing onceâ¦ bouncing twice and then it was gone,"" Mr Drennan said. Daniella and John called police straight away and officers were able to jar the grate open with a crow bar. They looked underneath, with the aid of torches, for at least two hours But it was to no avail. ""We just presumed it was gone. In the end, we had no choice but to walk away and try to enjoy the rest of our weekend,"" Mr Drennan said. Daniella was inconsolable and so they left without leaving their names with police, feeling hopeless. They arrived home on Sunday and said they were planning on going straight to the jewellery store to buy another ring. ""I couldn't stand the thought of her being without one,"" Mr Drennan said. But just moments after they touched down at the airport, a friend alerted them to the social media campaign being driven by the New York Police Department. Police had posted the CCTV footage of the couple trying to get the ring from the grate and used Twitter to appeal to find them. Allow Twitter content?

""Hey guys, is this you?"" the friend asked the couple. ""We could not believe it, we really thought it was gone,"" Ms Anthony said. ""We don't use Twitter - we had absolutely no idea this was going on. But we are so happy."" ""We are so thankful to everyone - especially the New York Police Department and everyone who shared our story,"" the couple said. They also wanted to send a heartfelt thank you to everyone who stopped to help look at the scene. There was one family in particular that stayed on for moral support. ""They had a little girl who gave Daniella a big hug and told her not to worry,"" Mr Drennan said. ""At the time, that hug meant everything."" The couple will now liaise with the NYPD to get the ring safely returned to their home in Peterborough.

"This video can not be played Michael Gove: ""I'm supporting the prime minister"" If MPs don't back Theresa May's Brexit deal there could be another EU referendum, Michael Gove has said. The leading cabinet Brexiteer said Mrs May's deal was not perfect - but if MPs did not vote it through on 11 December there was a risk of ""no Brexit at all"". He told the BBC's Andrew Marr show there may now be a Commons majority for another referendum. Labour has said it will attempt to topple Mrs May and force a general election if MPs reject her deal. If that fails, they will then seek support in the Commons for another referendum. Michael Gove insisted Mrs May could still win the vote on 11 December despite dozens of her own MPs being against her EU deal. Corbyn will do BBC debate if head-to-head Another referendum 'may be PM's only option' Brexit: A really simple guide SNP will support bid to put Brexit on hold The environment secretary told the BBC that winning the Commons vote would be ""challenging"". But although Mrs May's deal was not perfect, ""we have got to recognise that if we don't vote for this, the alternatives are no deal or no Brexit"". ""There is a real risk if we don't vote for this deal there may be a majority in the House of Commons for a second referendum,"" said Mr Gove, a leading figure in the 2016 Leave campaign. Asked if Mrs May would have to stand down as PM if she lost the vote on her deal in nine days' time, he said: ""Absolutely not."" He claimed there was a ""strong movement behind the prime minister"" among the public. Labour has said it will table a no confidence motion in the government if MPs vote down the deal in a bid to topple Mrs May and force a general election. Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said: ""If the prime minister has lost a vote of that significance then there has to be a question of confidence in the government. ""I think it's inevitable that we would seek to move that,"" he added. Under the Fixed Term Parliament Act, if the government loses a vote on a motion of no confidence it has 14 days to pass a second confidence motion, or Parliament is dissolved and a general election is called. If Labour fails to force a general election it will seek support in the Commons for another EU referendum. Mr Gyimah said he would be voting against Mrs May's Brexit deal Conservative support for a further referendum is growing -science minister Sam Gyimahquit the government on Saturday to join the People's Vote campaign. A cross-party group of 17 MPs,in a letter published in the Observer,,externalhas also called for Parliament to support another referendum at the earliest opportunity. But a referendum can only be held if the government legislates for one and a majority of MPs vote for it. The People's Vote campaign, which is backed by about 30 Labour MPs, a smaller number of Conservatives, the Lib Dems, the SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Greens, argue that the public must be given the final say on the terms of Britain's exit, now that they know what the deal is. Following Michael Gove's comments on the Marr show, Lib Dem Brexit spokesman Tom Brake said: ""The government has made a Horlicks out of Brexit and now one of its chief architects has admitted that the final say might go back to the people."" He said the Lib Dems and ""many others"" will ""demand a People's Vote with an option to remain in the EU"". Labour's shadow international development secretary Barry Gardiner told Andrew Marr he thought ""remain and no-deal"" would have to be ""on the table"" in any referendum. But Sir Keir Starmer told Sky News he would be ""worried"" about no-deal being on the ballot paper, as it would be ""catastrophic"" for the country. Michael Gove claimed the Leave campaign would probably win a fresh referendum by an even larger margin but holding one would ""damage faith in democracy and rip apart the social fabric"" of the country. Many Leave voters would see it is a ""condescending"" move by the political establishment, who would effectively be saying people were ""too thick to make a decision"" the first time around, he told Andrew Marr. This video can not be played Asked about the legacy she'd like to leave as PM, Mrs May says there's ""a lot more for me still to do"". By Laura Kuenssberg, BBC political editor Support for the prime minister's Brexit compromise seems to be shrinking, rather than growing. If Theresa May acknowledges it in private, she certainly won't touch that notion in public. Read more from Laura here The government claims the chances of Britain leaving the EU on 29 March without a deal are more likely if MPs reject Mrs May's deal. Mr Gove said there would not be another Commons vote on the deal if MPs voted it down on 11 December - something Mrs May has previously refused to rule out. There has been speculation the prime minister could return to Brussels to ask for the deal to be modified to reflect MPs' concerns before putting it to another Commons vote. The EU has said the deal it has agreed with Mrs May is their final offer and it will not be renegotiated. Dominic Raab claims the Irish backstop would be indefinite They argue the UK will be kept tied to the EU with no say in its rules until Brussels decides it can leave, under the terms of the Northern Irish ""backstop"". Mrs May insists the backstop, which is designed to keep the Irish border open until the UK can agree a free trade deal with the EU, would be temporary. However, her former Brexit secretaryDominic Raab told the Sunday Times,externalthe backstop would last indefinitely - for as long as it takes to negotiate a new UK-EU relationship - ""unless the EU allows us to exit"". Michael Gove told Andrew Marr he was also uncomfortable about the ""backstop"" but it would be temporary. This was because it would hand the UK economy a ""competitive advantage"" over the remaining 27 EU nations, he argued. Sir Keir Starmer is pressing for contempt of Parliament proceedings Opponents of Theresa May's Brexit deal believe the UK's chief law officer, Geoffrey Cox, has advised the government that the Northern Ireland ""backstop"" would continue indefinitely. They think this is why the government is refusing to publish Mr Cox's legal advice on the EU withdrawal agreement in full - as it would make it even harder for her to convince MPs to back her deal. The government insists such legal advice is always confidential - and that MPs will be able to question Mr Cox about it on Monday, when he makes a statement to the Commons. MPs will start five days of debate on the deal on Tuesday. But Labour is spearheading a cross-party effort - including the government's partners the DUP - to force the legal advice to be published, ahead of the debate. Sir Keir, a former director of public prosecutions, said the opposition parties would press for contempt of Parliament proceedings if MPs are not shown the advice. If contempt proceedings were requested, it would be up to Commons Speaker John Bercow to decide whether a debate and vote should be held.

Labour's shadow attorney general Nick Thomas-Symonds accused Mr Cox of ""hiding"" his full legal advice on Theresa May's Brexit deal ""for fear of the political consequences"". He accused the government of ""playing for time, hoping that the contempt proceedings take longer than the timetable for the meaningful vote"". Mr Bercow told the MPs he would deliver a verdict on whether they would be granted a debate and a vote on whether the government was in contempt later on Monday or ""at the earliest opportunity tomorrow"". Mr Cox mounted an impassioned defence of his decision not to publish the full advice, insisting it would not be ""in the national interest"" to break a longstanding convention that law officers' advice to ministers is confidential. He said he would answer all MPs' questions and there was no cover-up, adding: ""There is nothing to see here."" He angrily told MPs calling for it to be published to ""grow up and get real"", prompting Green MP Caroline Lucas to accuse him of indulging in ""amateur dramatics"" and turning the debate into a ""farce"". Nigel Dodds, leader of the Democratic Unionist Party at Westminster, told Mr Cox MPs needed to see the full legal advice he had given to the government - and denounced the Irish ""backstop"" plan as ""deeply unattractive"". The Northern Ireland ""backstop"" is a last-resort plan designed to prevent a return to a visible border on the island of Ireland, with both the UK and the EU saying they want to avoid anything which puts the peace process at risk. It would be triggered if no trade deal has been agreed with the EU that avoids the need for a hard border by the end of the 21-month transition period after 29 March's official departure date. Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop It would keep the whole of the UK tied to EU customs rules, unless the two sides come up with another way of avoiding border checks. Under the EU withdrawal agreement, neither side can unilaterally withdraw from it - but it is meant to be temporary. Geoffrey Cox told MPs: ""We are indefinitely committed to it if it came into force. There is no point in my trying any more than the government trying to disguise that fact. He said he would have preferred to see a clause inserted into the EU withdrawal agreement that allowed the UK to exit the backstop if negotiations ""had irretrievably broken down"". But he added: ""I am prepared to lend my support to this agreement because I do not believe that we are likely to be entrapped in it permanently."" He said Theresa May's deal ""represents a sensible compromise"". ""It has unattractive elements, unsatisfactory elements for us,"" he went on, but MPs had to ""weigh it against other risks"" such as the ""chaos"" of a no-deal Brexit or no Brexit. He urged MPs to ""take the key of the cell door and get out on 29 March - and this deal is the best way of doing that"".

The UK is due to leave the European Union on 29 March, 2019. The UK and the EU have agreed a detailed plan for how Brexit happens, with a draft outline of how they want the future relationship to work. But the plan has to be backed by both the UK and EU parliaments before 29 March, if the UK is to leave under these terms. If it is not ratified then the UK would be on course to leave the EU without any deal - although a delay to Brexit to allow either a renegotiated deal or a further referendum have been floated as alternatives.

"This video can not be played Asked about the legacy she'd like to leave as PM, Mrs May says there's ""a lot more for me still to do"". Theresa May has sought to reassure world leaders that her Brexit deal is ""good for the global economy"". The PM was speaking at the G20 summit in Argentina, where she has met leaders for talks on trade deals after Brexit. She said they were ""keen"" to sign free trade agreements and wanted certainty, which she pledged her deal would bring. Asked about her legacy as PM, she said there was ""a lot more for me still to do, not least being the prime minister that does take the UK out of the EU"". The G20, which this year holds its summit in Buenos Aires, is made up of the 19 of the world's most industrialised nations, plus the European Union. It accounts for 85% of the world's economic output and two-thirds of the world's population. Trump and Xi to meet amid trade tensions Brexit: A really simple guide Another referendum 'may be PM's only option' ""For the first time in more than four decades, the UK will have an independent trade policy,"" she told reporters at a press conference. ""That this deal sets a path for the UK to a brighter future has been affirmed by the discussions I've had on trade over the past two days with friends and partners making clear that they are keen to sign and implement ambitious free trade agreements as soon as possible."" The summit came as another government minister,Sam Gyimah, resignedover Mrs May's Brexit deal, saying he would vote against it when the agreement goes before Parliament on 11 December. Labour, the Lib Dems, the SNP, the DUP and many other Tory MPs have said they will also vote against it. Mrs May also said she had raised the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi during her meeting with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman Asked about the situation back in the UK, Mrs May said: ""The next nine days are a really important time for our country leading up to the vote on this deal. ""I will be talking with members of Parliament obviously and explaining to them why I believe this is a good deal for the UK. ""Why it is a deal that delivers on Brexit but it is also a deal that protects jobs and the economy and why passing this deal in the vote that takes place in the House of the Commons will take us to certainty for the future, and that failure to do that would only lead to uncertainty. ""What I've been hearing here at the G20 is the importance of that certainty for the future."" Can May get Brexit deal through Commons? The five Brexit questions everyone's asking Google The Brexit deal has already been agreed between the EU and UK. If MPs reject the deal, a number of things could happen - including leaving with no deal, an attempt to renegotiate or a general election. By Laura Kuenssberg, BBC political editor Asked if this might be her last overseas trip, the prime minister insisted ""there's a lot more for me to do"". A senior member of the government told me not only would she not have discussions about losing the vote - only about how to win it -  but that those who believed that Theresa May would quit if her deal fell were misreading her. They said that she would ""not go until she was forced to go"" and, contrary to some of the speculation in Westminster, even a heavy defeat for her plan would not automatically see her depart. Of course, many of her critics - and the opposition parties - would beg to differ. Read more from Laura here Mrs May held one-to-one talks with the leaders of Australia, Canada, Japan, Turkey and Chile. The Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, urged her to avoid a no-deal Brexit. Major Japanese companies such as Nissan - which employs 7,000 people at Britain's biggest car factory in Sunderland - and Honda are concerned about the possible impact on their supply chains across Europe. Japan's prime minister told Mrs May to avoid a no-deal Brexit She said told him she was confident Japanese businesses in the UK would continue to trade well with the EU. Mrs May also held talks with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who praised her ""great determination on one of the most vexed issues I think there is"". The prime minister was also quizzed about her meeting with the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman - who she shook hands with - on Friday. She did not say whether she had confronted him directly over the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at Saudi Arabia's consulate in Istanbul in October. ""What I said to the Crown Prince yesterday was the importance of a full, credible and transparent investigation that identifies those who were involved and the importance of ensuring that those who were involved are held to account,"" she said.

"A statue of Marianne, a symbol in France, was vandalised inside the Arc de Triomphe French President Emmanuel Macron has held an urgent security meeting following a day of riots by thousands of anti-government protesters. Ministers said that while no options had been ruled out, imposing a state of emergency had not been discussed during the talks - despite earlier reports. Protests over fuel tax have grown into general anger at higher living costs. Three people have been killed in the protests since demonstrations started more than two weeks ago, police said. Justice Minister Nicole Belloubet has promised to bring the full force of the law to bear on people who are found to have resorted to violence. Before the security meeting on Sunday, Mr Macron inspected some of the damage caused in the disturbances, which had centred on Paris. More than 100 people were injured in the city, including 23 members of the security forces, and nearly 400 people were arrested, police said. Vehicles in the streets of Paris were torched and some 400 arrests were made Mr Macron assesses damage caused during the ""gilets jaunes"" protests near the Champs-ElysÃ©es Mr Macron visited the Champs-ElysÃ©es and the Arc de Triomphe, which was scaled by demonstrators on Saturday. He later chaired an urgent meeting at the presidential palace, involving the interior minister and top security service officials. Will Macron face down French fuel protesters? Jobseeker: Macron should help me find work France's interior ministry says about 136,000 people took part in the protests nationwide, showing widespread support for the movement known as the ""gilets jaunes"" (yellow vests). This video can not be played Dozens of people were injured in Saturday's clashes Government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux earlier told Europe 1 radio that a state-of-emergency declaration was a possible option. ""We have to think about the measures that can be taken so that these incidents don't happen again,"" he said. The ""gilets jaunes"" protesters, so-called because they have taken to the streets wearing the high-visibility yellow clothing that is required to be carried in every vehicle by French law, are complaining at a sharp increase in diesel taxes. Mr Macron says his motivation for the increase is environmental, but protesters call him out of touch - particularly with non-city dwellers who rely on their cars. This video can not be played France fuel protests: Who are the people in the yellow vests? The protest movement has no identifiable leadership and has gained momentum via social media, encompassing a whole range of participants from the anarchist far left to the nationalist far right, and plenty of moderates in between. Nearly 300,000 people took part in the first country-wide demonstration, on 17 November. By Hugh Schofield, Paris correspondent Coming straight from the airport, the president was greeted with cheers but also boos as he looked at the wreckage of burnt-out cars and smashed windows on the Avenue KlÃ©ber. At the Arc de Triomphe, he saw the graffiti targeting him and his government sprayed on the outside, and inside the devastation in the ticketing and reception areas, which had been ransacked by rioters. The president and his ministers must now decide what action to take in response to a turn of events that in its drama and violence has shocked the country. He may be hoping that the wanton destruction in the capital marks a turning point, and that many ordinary ""yellow vests"" will now feel they have had enough. If so, that might be a rash calculation. The bigger point is their grievances over rising taxes and falling standards of living, and they still have plenty of support. The ""yellow vest"" protesters rallied for a third weekend on Saturday, taking to the streets across the country, including in Narbonne, Nantes and Marseille. One driver died in an accident at a protesters' blockade in Arles, after a car collided with a heavy goods vehicle, a gendarmerie official told Reuters news agency. Riot police were splattered with yellow paint On the Champs-ElysÃ©es in central Paris, police fired tear gas, stun grenades and water cannon, while masked protesters hurled projectiles and set buildings on fire. Nearly 190 fires were put out and six buildings were set ablaze, the interior ministry said. Department stores and metro stations were closed as a result of the violence. ""I will never accept violence,"" Mr Macron told a news conference in Buenos Aires on Saturday. ""No cause justifies that authorities are attacked, that businesses are plundered, that passers-by or journalists are threatened or that the Arc du Triomphe is defiled,"" he said. He has long maintained that his fuel policies are needed to combat global warming and has accused his political opponents of hijacking the movement in order to block his reform programme. Earlier this week,Mr Macron tried to strike a conciliatory tone, saying he was open to ideas about how the fuel tax could be applied. The price of diesel, the most commonly used fuel in French cars, has risen by around 23% over the past 12 months to an average of â¬1.51 (Â£1.32; $1.71) per litre, its highest point since the early 2000s. World oil prices did rise before falling back again but the Macron government raised its hydrocarbon tax this year by 7.6 cents per litre on diesel and 3.9 cents on petrol, as part of a campaign for cleaner cars and fuel. The decision to impose a further increase of 6.5 cents on diesel and 2.9 cents on petrol on 1 January 2019 was seen as the final straw. The clean-up is under way.

"Ted Baker founder Ray Kelvin famously refuses to show his full face in photos Staff at fashion group Ted Baker allege there is a culture of ""forced hugging"" by the firm's founder and boss, which they are now demanding be ended. A petition, launched by an employee, also accuses 62-year-old Ray Kelvin of inappropriate comments and behaviour. ""It is part of a culture that leaves harassment unchallenged,"" they claim. The company, which issues a trading update on Thursday, says hugs are ""part of Ted Baker's culture, but are absolutely not insisted upon"". It said Mr Kelvin greeted many people with a hug, ""be it a shareholder, investor, supplier, partner, customer or colleague"". The petition on the workplace website Organise had more than 2,000 signatures by Sunday evening. It is also claimed that as well as engaging them in unwelcome embraces, the brand's founder asked young female members of staff to sit on his knee, cuddle him, or let him massage their ears. They also allege that millionaire Mr Kelvin, who launched Ted Baker more than 30 years ago, regularly uses sexual innuendo. But Ted Baker also said that the matters raised in the petition were ""at odds with the values of our business and those of our CEO"". And it said it would ""ensure a thorough independent investigation is carried out"" into the allegations. Another complaint made in the petition is that previous complaints have been ignored. ""Please set up a way of reporting harassment to an independent, external body - HR has done nothing with the reports of harassment to date,"" says the petition. But the firm said there were ""very clear and robust HR policies in place to provide all employees with a wide range of reporting options for any issues that they might encounter, including a completely confidential and anonymous, 24/7 helpline"". Ted Baker, named after a fictitious alter ego of Mr Kelvin, opened its first store in Glasgow in 1988 and now has 544 outlets worldwide selling fashion and accessories. Mr Kelvin is worth Â£522m according to the Sunday Times Rich List.

"Police in New York have found the couple who got engaged in Times Square on Friday but lost the ringdown a grate. The NYPD tweeted on Sunday that arrangements were being made to return the ring to the pair, who are from the UK. CCTV images showed the couple unsuccessfully trying to retrieve the piece of jewellery. But police officers later managed to rescue and clean it. The BBC has been in touch with the couple and understands they are from Peterborough, Cambridgeshire in the UK. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

His fiancÃ©e, who police confirmed said ""Yes"", puts her hands to her face when she realises what has happened. She crouches down next to him, trying to help but they are unsuccessful. The man then lies down on the floor by the grate, trying to reach the piece of jewellery but again they are unable to retrieve it. Officers from the New York Police Department clearly have a romantic side and, more importantly, access to the grate, so could get it out quite easily. Earlier, they had put out a plea for the man and woman to come forward. Later on Sunday they released an image of the cleaned-up ring on their Twitter account with the caption: ""Here's a photo of the ring our officers recovered (and cleaned!)

"Pope Francis has said that homosexuality in the clergy is a ""serious matter"" that ""worries"" him. The comments were made in an interview about religious vocations, given to a Spanish missionary priest as part of an upcoming book. The pontiff described homosexuality as ""fashionable"", and urged clergy to observe their vow of celibacy. Italian daily Corriere della Sera ran excerpts of the interviews on its website on Saturday. Pope Francis said that the Church had to be ""demanding"" in choosing candidates for the priesthood. ""The question of homosexuality is a very serious one,"",externalsaid the pontiff, adding that those responsible for training priests must make sure candidates are ""humanly and emotionally mature"" before they are ordained. ""For this reason, the Church urges that persons with this rooted tendency not be accepted into ministry or consecrated life."" This also applied to women who wanted to become nuns. Pope tells gay abuse victim 'God loves you' How Pope Francis became a movie star Pope changes teaching on death penalty The comments made by the pontiffreiterate past Vatican statements about the selection of candidates for religious life,external. ""In our societies, it even seems homosexuality is fashionable. And this mentality, in some way, also influences the life of the Church,"" he went on to say. The head of the Catholic Church stressed there was ""no room for this"" in the lives of priests and nuns. The interviews were conducted in mid-August In 2013, Pope Francisreaffirmed the Roman Catholic Church's positionthat homosexual acts were sinful, but homosexual orientation was not. The 'fallible' Pope strikes a new chord Archbishop 'in hiding' over Pope letter ""If a person is gay and seeks God and has good will, who am I to judge?"" he said. ""The Strength of Vocation"", by Father Fernando Prado, is based on four hours of interviews with the pontiff on the challenges of being a member of the clergy. It will be published next week.

"This video can not be played Sir David Attenborough addressing the climate change conference in Poland. The naturalist Sir David Attenborough has said climate change is humanity's greatest threat in thousands of years. The broadcaster said it could lead to the collapse of civilisations and the extinction of ""much of the natural world"". He was speaking at the opening ceremony of United Nations-sponsored climate talks in Katowice, Poland. The meeting is the most critical on climate change since the 2015 Paris agreement. Sir David said: ""Right now, we are facing a man-made disaster of global scale. Our greatest threat in thousands of years. Climate change. ""If we don't take action, the collapse of our civilisations and the extinction of much of the natural world is on the horizon."" The naturalist is taking up the ""People's Seat"" at the conference, called COP24. He is supposed to act as a link between the public and policy-makers at the meeting. ""The world's people have spoken. Their message is clear. Time is running out. They want you, the decision-makers, to act now,"" he said. Speaking at the opening ceremony, Antonio Guterres, UN Secretary-General, said climate change was already ""a matter of life and death"" for many countries. He explained that the world is ""nowhere near where it needs to be"" on the transition to a low-carbon economy. But the UN Secretary-General said the conference was an effort to ""right the ship"" and he would convene a climate summit next year to discuss next steps. Meanwhile, the World Bank has announced $200bn in funding over five years to support countries taking action against climate change. Climate change: Where we are in seven charts What is climate change? 'Trump effect' limits action on climate This video can not be played Climate activist: 'It's high time that Poland phased out coal' This Conference of the Parties (COP) is the first to be held since the landmark Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)reporton limiting global temperature rise to 1.5C came out in October. The IPCC stated that to keep to the 1.5C goal, governments would have to slash emissions of greenhouse gases by 45% by 2030. Buta recent studyshowed that CO2 emissions are on the rise again after stalling for four years. In an unprecedented move, four former UN climate talks presidents issued a statement on Sunday, calling for urgent action. They say ""decisive action in the next two years will be crucial"". This video can not be played Climate change: How 1.5C could change the world Meanwhile, the gap between what countries say they are doing and what needs to be done has never been wider. So urgent is the task that some negotiators began their meetings on Sunday, a day before the official start. Yes, some 29 heads of state and government are due to give statements at the opening of the meeting. The number is way down on the stellar cast that turned up in Paris in 2015, which perhaps indicates that many are seeing this as more a technical stage on the road to tackling climate change than a big bang moment. But for the likes of China and the EU, the meeting is critical. They will want to show that international co-operation can still work even in the age of President Trump. 2019 10 warmest years 10 coldest years 20th Century average Hotter Colder Source: NOAA Rather than spending all their time working on how to increase ambitions to cut carbon, conference delegates are likely to focus on trying to finalise the technical rules of how the Paris agreement will work. A collage of children's drawing about climate change laid out on a glacier in Switzerland While the agreement was ratified in record time by more than 180 countries in 2016, it doesn't become operational until 2020. Before then, delegates must sort out common rules on measuring, reporting and verifying (checking to avoid the misreporting of) greenhouse gas emissions, and on how climate finance is going to be provided. ""The rulebook is the thing that will absorb most of the negotiators' capacity at this year's COP,"" said Camilla Born, from the climate change think tank, E3G. ""It's no surprise, as agreeing the Paris rules is both technically and politically a complicated task - but it is worth it!"" What is in the Paris climate agreement? Last four years are 'world's hottest' Race to pull greenhouse gases from air Right now, that rule book runs to several hundred pages with thousands of brackets, indicating areas of dispute. Under the Paris agreement, each country decides for itself the actions it will take when it comes to cutting carbon. Some observers believe that the changed mood and the urgency of the science will prompt action. ""We are hoping that at COP24, countries will make declarations of how they will raise their ambitions by 2020. This is a very important moment,"" said Fernanda Carvalho with campaign group WWF. ""Two years is a short time span for that to happen. Countries need to act fast."" There is much frustration with the snail-like pace, especially among some campaigners who feel that the scale of the threat posed by rising temperatures hasn't been fully grasped by politicians. Greta Thunberg, who has refused to go to school in Sweden in protest over climate change, will be attending COP24 ""Governments across the world have completely failed to protect their citizens,"" said a spokesperson for Extinction Rebellion, the social movement that pushes for radical change on climate issues. ""Instead, they have pursued quick profit and big business. We need this to change. At COP24, we want to ensure that the focus is not just on getting the technical Paris rulebook as robust as possible, but also that governments do not lose sight of the bigger picture."" Others involved in the UN process say that real progress is being made in tackling one of the most complex problems ever faced by the world. ""We have a $300bn renewable energy economy at work today - it's not peanuts; it's an energy revolution that has unfolded on the back of, yes, a sometimes sticky climate negotiation process,"" said Achim Steiner, who heads the United Nations Development Programme. Many developing countries see progress on issues around finance to be critical to moving forward. They have been promised $100bn every year from 2020 as part of the Paris agreement. Some are sceptical about what they see as foot-dragging and obfuscation by richer countries when it comes to handing over the cash. Negotiators say that moving forward on finance is the lynchpin of progress in this meeting. ""A key finding of the recent IPCC report, and one that has often been overlooked, is that without a dramatic increase in the provision of climate finance, the possibility of limiting warming to 2C (to say nothing of the safer 1.5C goal) will irretrievably slip away,"" said Amjad Abdulla, chief negotiator for the Alliance of Small Island States. Yes - among government negotiators and observers alike. The fact that the conference is taking place in a strong coal region, in a city that is home to the biggest coal company in the EU, is troubling to many. The Polish government says that it is sticking with the fuel, and has announced that it is planning to invest next year in the construction of a new coal mine in Silesia. This bullish approach has drawn condemnation from some. ""Unfortunately, this week's announcement by the [meeting's] Polish presidency that it will include coal companies as sponsors of the COP sends a very worrisome signal before the conference even begins,"" said SÃ©bastien Duyck, a senior attorney at the Centre for International Environmental Law. Although the US has withdrawn from the Paris agreement, it cannot leave until 2020, so its negotiators have been taking part in meetings and have not obstructed the process. America is expected to participate in COP24. However, given the President's well known love of coal, it has been reported that the White House will once again organise a side event promoting fossil fuels.A similar event at the last COP provoked outrage from many delegates. The summit comes three years after the 2015 Paris accord on climate change, at which all countries agreed a plan to limit carbon emissions. Now is the moment governments must start deciding what to do to make sure that plan is put into effect. In graphics:Seven charts that show the rate of warming Advice:What can I do to help?

"Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife Sara are suspected of awarding regulatory favours to a telecom firm Israeli police have recommended indicting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife Sara for alleged fraud and bribery. They are suspected of awarding regulatory favours to the Bezeq telecom firm in return for positive media coverage of the couple. Mr Netanyahu rejected the allegations in what is known as Case 4000. The Israeli attorney-general will now have to decide whether to bring charges in the case. Israel's dilemma over 'magician' Netanyahu's future Netanyahu: The commando turned PM In February, police recommended indicting Mr Netanyahu in two other corruption investigations. On Sunday, the Israeli police and the Israel Securities Authorities said there was sufficient evidence for bribery, fraud and breach-of-trust charges to be brought against Mr Netanyahu and his wife. They are suspected of interfering in regulatory decisions that favoured Bezeq and its majority shareholder Shaul Elovitch. In return, the couple are alleged to have been given more positive coverage on Walla! news website, owned by Bezeq. The police also said there was sufficient evidence to indict Mr Elovitch for giving bribes. Responding to the latest allegations, Mr Netanyahu tweeted: ""These recommendations were determined and leaked even before the investigations began. ""I'm sure that in this case the relevant authorities, after examining the issue, will reach the same conclusion: that there was nothing because there is nothing."" Mr Elovitch has so far made no public comments on the issue. One of them centres on an allegation that Mr Netanyahu asked the publisher of an Israeli newspaper, Yediot Aharonot, for positive coverage in exchange for help in reining in a rival publication. In the second case, Mr Netanyahu is suspected of receiving gifts worth at least a million shekels ($270,000; Â£210,000) from Hollywood mogul Arnon Milchan and other supporters. The Jerusalem Post reported earlier this year that the gifts included champagne and cigars, and were given in exchange for help getting Mr Milchan a US visa. Mr Netanyahu has dismissed all the allegations as ""baseless"". Israeli media say the 69-year-old prime minister has been questioned by investigators a number of times. Mr Netanyahu heads a fragile coalition, but he appears confident the allegations will not spur early elections. The next legislative poll is scheduled for November 2019. Mr Netanyahu is in his second stint as prime minister.

"X-rays revealed the extent of two of the birds' injuries An entire family of swans has been wiped out when the birds were shot and killed in a ""senseless"" attack. The bodies of two adults and five cygnets were found wrapped in plastic bags in Benenden, Kent on 24 November. X-rays showed one of the birds found by the bank of a stream in Stepneyford Lane had been ""peppered with pellets"". RSPCA Inspector Dave Grant said it was ""absolutely disgusting that someone would purposefully target and kill these beautiful birds"". Mr Grant was alerted to the killings by police and is now investigating. Two of the bodies were examined by the RSPCA in Hastings, East Sussex, with X-rays revealing numerous pellet or shot in both bodies. Mr Grant said: ""It's clear that these poor mute swans have been shot and killed deliberately... and it's heartbreaking that an entire family has been wiped out in this cruel incident."" X-ray images showed one bird had been ""peppered with shots"" PC Daniel Perry, from Kent Police rural task force, said it was called at about 10:00 GMT on 24 November after the swans were found.

"This video can not be played Fury v Wilder: 'The division is alive again' - how the dramatic final round unfolded Tyson Fury's shot at completing a remarkable return to the top of world boxing saw him survive two knockdowns in an enthralling draw with WBC heavyweight champion Deontay Wilder in Los Angeles. In one of the most thrilling heavyweight contests for years, the Briton was floored in the ninth round and brutally dropped in the 12th, somehow regaining his feet to survive for two minutes. Fury had shown plenty of the evasive, counter-punching skill that made his name before his 30-month spell away from the sport and he enjoyed success in the middle rounds. Wilder v Fury: Listen again and relive the drama as it unfolded 'It happened to me and I knew it would happen to him': Lennox Lewis on controversial decision 'This was the best boxing comeback in history' - Fury calls for rematch with Wilder Wilder v Fury: 'The division is alive again' - how the dramatic final round unfolded Listen: Wilder v Fury: One for the ages - 5 live podcast But in the 12th he lay motionless after a savage combination, barely making the count to see out the contest, which was scored 115-111 for Wilder, 114-112 for Fury and 113-113. Fury - and much of the ringside media - felt he had won and had he stayed on his feet in the final three minutes, the WBC title would have been his. After 36 minutes of the most tense and absorbing action, both men spoke of a rematch, which appears a certainty. Fury, whose promoter Frank Warren claimed ""everyone knows"" his man had won, said: ""We're on away soil. I got knocked down but I still believe I won the fight. I'm showing total professionalism. ""The Gypsy King has returned. I'm a professional athlete who loves to fight. He is a fearsome fighter. The world knows the truth."" Wilder said his two knockdowns meant he ""definitely won the fight"". ""I don't know if [a rematch] will be my next fight but would love it to be. We need to do it again."" Fury got up from his final-round knockdown with the referee's count at nine Those at ringside - who included boxing greats Floyd Mayweather, Evander Holyfield, Lennox Lewis and James 'Buster' Douglas, as well as actress Hayden Panettiere and footballer Zlatan Ibrahimovic - were left asking the same question after the fight: how did Tyson Fury get up? The right hand and left hook Wilder landed cleanly in the final round were crushing and looked certain to have ended the contest. ""I saw his eyes roll into the back of his head. I was like it's over,"" Wilder said afterwards. It would have been cruel. The 17,698 in the Staples Center had seen Fury contribute immensely, landing punches time and again and goading his rival. Wilder's ring walk was accompanied by his WBC belt being lowered into the ring under spotlight, while Fury worked pads with trainer Ben Davison, seemingly oblivious to the spectacle. The Briton frustrated his big-hitting American counterpart but produced blows of his own, landing a stunning left-right in the seventh that prompted Wilder to give chase and swing to no avail as Fury evaded. But the threat from a man with 39 knockout wins remained always in evidence, as some at ringside watched through their hands. The power punches duly came, a chopping right hand behind Fury's ear sending the Briton down in round nine. He held on, ducked, bravely punched back and survived, somehow. And so to the 12th, three minutes few will forget. Wilder looked a little stunned to see his rival come back for more after crashing to the mat and the bell brought roars of appreciation from the crowd. Mike Costello, BBC boxing correspondent This has been a memorable night here in Los Angeles - be in no doubt that the heavyweight division is alive and well again. It has been such a compelling night with Fury in control for so, so long. He was almost in tears here at ringside as he took a warm embrace from his brother. This has been a long road back for him in so many ways. If you are looking at the images of him being pounded to the canvas, you cannot believe how the man rose to his feet after a colossal right hand from Deontay Wilder. The noisy singing of God Save The Queen at the Staples Center was evidence of a healthy British support in the arena - and, indeed, Fury has re-emerged as something of a people's champion after time spent away from the sport to overcome depression, during which he also accepted a backdated two-year UK Anti-Doping ban. But two routine wins since his June return taught little, and his 10-stone weight drop proved more of a talking point than his performances. Fury was an underdog with bookmakers, and his own team admitted this challenge had come six months sooner than they would have preferred. But he took a chance, knowing it could be a fleeting one, given the clamour for Wilder to face Anthony Joshua in a bout for all four world titles. After this display, he has shown he is legitimately back in the mix. The man who held three world titles after his surprise victory over Wladimir Klitschko in 2015 showed his trademark body and head movement, and frequently flummoxed Wilder with his quick feet and counter-punching. The jab was slick, his right hand landed frequently, and despite the dramatic weight loss, his punch resistance and durability were truly remarkable. One of Wilder's team likened Fury to WWE wrestler The Undertaker, such was his 12th-round 'back-from-the-dead' recovery. It has been a remarkable three years. From world champion to depression, and ballooning to 28 stone, Fury is, somehow, back among the elite names of the glamour division. Fury, left, was knocked down twice by Wilder but otherwise dominated Wilder showed why he is champion. Even when frustrated by his opponent, he found a way to deliver crucial blows. His performance - and this captivating bout - will do his profile no harm in the US. The heavyweight scene has stagnated in the country but Warren said Las Vegas would be desperate for a rematch, while a UK meeting would undoubtedly sell out a stadium. Fury earned a reported Â£7m for his work, Wilder Â£3m more. Both men remain undefeated. They will earn even more when it happens again. After an incredible night of drama which delivered on the hype, surely it has to? Promoter Frank Warren on BT Sport Box Office:""It is a draw but everyone knows [Fury] won it and we will want to do a rematch. How could a fight like this not be a rematch? It is unfinished business. ""In Britain that is an 80,000 job. Vegas will be drooling for this. When was the last time you saw a great fight in the USA."" Tyson Fury:""We're the best two heavyweights on the planet. There is another heavyweight who is a chicken. Joshua, where are you?"" Deontay Wilder:""I did not sit still, I was too hesitant, I started overthrowing the right hand. I was forcing my punches too much. ""When I rush my punches like that I'm never accurate. The rematch I guarantee I'm going to get him."" Tyson Fury's trainer Ben Davison:""I told Tyson before the fight he would beat him with his left hand. We didn't come here for money to get through the fight, we came here to win and I'm sick and gutted."" WBC president Mauricio Sulaiman to BBC Radio 5 live Sportsweek:""I think the draw is well taken. It could have gone either way. It was a great fight. The two knock-downs were the defining factor of the fight. ""Several rounds were very close - a few punches makes the difference. "" Lennon Lewis, former undisputed champion, gives his respect to Tyson Fury Manny Pacquiao, former eight-division world champion:Respect to Fury for sticking to his game plan and to Wilder for closing the gap with two huge knockdowns! Can't wait to see the rematch. Amir Khan, former unified light-welterweight world champion:What a fight. Wilder v Fury has to be up there as one of the best heavyweight fights I've seen. Well done to my friends Tyson Fury and Tony Bellew. Enjoy Christmas lads. Well deserved. Three-time NBA champion LeBron James:Man that was the funniest/craziest fight I've ever seen in my life.

"Timur Siraziev's report from outside the Berkshire base was broadcast on Russia's Channel One A Russian TV reporter who sparked a security alert has denied trying to infiltrate a British Army base. Timur Siraziev, of Channel One, was seen outside 77 Brigade's Berkshire base with a camera crew, theMail on Sunday reported,external. It led to an urgent warning at every base in the country not to approach Mr Siraziev if alone, but to contact police, the paper said. The 77 Brigade works in social media and psychological operations. Mr Siraziev told the RIA Novosti news agency the crew had been operating openly, on public land, and ""did not try to penetrate the base"". He said: ""I came to the checkpoint, introduced myself, that I was Timur Siraziev, a journalist for Channel One, said that we wanted to talk."" Russia 'bigger threat than IS' - Army chief Inside Army 'psy-ops' headquarters The MoD said Mr Siraziev's ""suspicious"" behaviour was monitored by the base's security systems throughout. Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson also urged the public to report suspicious activity near military sites. Mr Williamson said: ""We take the security of our bases and personnel incredibly seriously. ""If a member of the public sees anyone acting suspiciously in or around a military base it should be reported to the police as a matter of urgency."" Russia's Channel One later broadcast Mr Siraziev's report, which contained footage apparently filmed from a vehicle as it passed the barracks in Hermitage on 21 November. He is also shown speaking on camera as he walks close to an entrance to the base. The BBC's Russian service said that, in his report, Mr Siraziev claimed that the building of the 77 Brigade was being used to ""attack social networks"" with ""fake news"". With UK-Russian relations frosty in the wake of theSalisbury Novichok poisoning, GCHQ chief Jeremy Fleming warned earlier this year that Moscow posed a ""real"" and ""active"" threat to the international community. Last month, the head of the Army, Gen Mark Carleton-Smith, described Russia as a ""far greater threat"" to UK security than the Islamic State group. Mr Siraziev is listed on the Russian Embassy's website as Channel One's bureau chief. When set up in 2015,77 Brigade was touted as a unitthat would help the UK to fight wars in the ""information age"" by helping to win hearts and minds. It includes both regular troops and reservists. Head of the Army at the time, Gen Sir Nick Carter, said the move was about trying to operate ""smarter"".

"This video can not be played Fury v Wilder: 'The division is alive again' - how the dramatic final round unfolded Tyson Fury's shot at completing a remarkable return to the top of world boxing saw him survive two knockdowns in an enthralling draw with WBC heavyweight champion Deontay Wilder in Los Angeles. In one of the most thrilling heavyweight contests for years, the Briton was floored in the ninth round and brutally dropped in the 12th, somehow regaining his feet to survive for two minutes. Fury had shown plenty of the evasive, counter-punching skill that made his name before his 30-month spell away from the sport and he enjoyed success in the middle rounds. Wilder v Fury: Listen again and relive the drama as it unfolded 'It happened to me and I knew it would happen to him': Lennox Lewis on controversial decision 'This was the best boxing comeback in history' - Fury calls for rematch with Wilder Wilder v Fury: 'The division is alive again' - how the dramatic final round unfolded Listen: Wilder v Fury: One for the ages - 5 live podcast But in the 12th he lay motionless after a savage combination, barely making the count to see out the contest, which was scored 115-111 for Wilder, 114-112 for Fury and 113-113. Fury - and much of the ringside media - felt he had won and had he stayed on his feet in the final three minutes, the WBC title would have been his. After 36 minutes of the most tense and absorbing action, both men spoke of a rematch, which appears a certainty. Fury, whose promoter Frank Warren claimed ""everyone knows"" his man had won, said: ""We're on away soil. I got knocked down but I still believe I won the fight. I'm showing total professionalism. ""The Gypsy King has returned. I'm a professional athlete who loves to fight. He is a fearsome fighter. The world knows the truth."" Wilder said his two knockdowns meant he ""definitely won the fight"". ""I don't know if [a rematch] will be my next fight but would love it to be. We need to do it again."" Fury got up from his final-round knockdown with the referee's count at nine Those at ringside - who included boxing greats Floyd Mayweather, Evander Holyfield, Lennox Lewis and James 'Buster' Douglas, as well as actress Hayden Panettiere and footballer Zlatan Ibrahimovic - were left asking the same question after the fight: how did Tyson Fury get up? The right hand and left hook Wilder landed cleanly in the final round were crushing and looked certain to have ended the contest. ""I saw his eyes roll into the back of his head. I was like it's over,"" Wilder said afterwards. It would have been cruel. The 17,698 in the Staples Center had seen Fury contribute immensely, landing punches time and again and goading his rival. Wilder's ring walk was accompanied by his WBC belt being lowered into the ring under spotlight, while Fury worked pads with trainer Ben Davison, seemingly oblivious to the spectacle. The Briton frustrated his big-hitting American counterpart but produced blows of his own, landing a stunning left-right in the seventh that prompted Wilder to give chase and swing to no avail as Fury evaded. But the threat from a man with 39 knockout wins remained always in evidence, as some at ringside watched through their hands. The power punches duly came, a chopping right hand behind Fury's ear sending the Briton down in round nine. He held on, ducked, bravely punched back and survived, somehow. And so to the 12th, three minutes few will forget. Wilder looked a little stunned to see his rival come back for more after crashing to the mat and the bell brought roars of appreciation from the crowd. Mike Costello, BBC boxing correspondent This has been a memorable night here in Los Angeles - be in no doubt that the heavyweight division is alive and well again. It has been such a compelling night with Fury in control for so, so long. He was almost in tears here at ringside as he took a warm embrace from his brother. This has been a long road back for him in so many ways. If you are looking at the images of him being pounded to the canvas, you cannot believe how the man rose to his feet after a colossal right hand from Deontay Wilder. The noisy singing of God Save The Queen at the Staples Center was evidence of a healthy British support in the arena - and, indeed, Fury has re-emerged as something of a people's champion after time spent away from the sport to overcome depression, during which he also accepted a backdated two-year UK Anti-Doping ban. But two routine wins since his June return taught little, and his 10-stone weight drop proved more of a talking point than his performances. Fury was an underdog with bookmakers, and his own team admitted this challenge had come six months sooner than they would have preferred. But he took a chance, knowing it could be a fleeting one, given the clamour for Wilder to face Anthony Joshua in a bout for all four world titles. After this display, he has shown he is legitimately back in the mix. The man who held three world titles after his surprise victory over Wladimir Klitschko in 2015 showed his trademark body and head movement, and frequently flummoxed Wilder with his quick feet and counter-punching. The jab was slick, his right hand landed frequently, and despite the dramatic weight loss, his punch resistance and durability were truly remarkable. One of Wilder's team likened Fury to WWE wrestler The Undertaker, such was his 12th-round 'back-from-the-dead' recovery. It has been a remarkable three years. From world champion to depression, and ballooning to 28 stone, Fury is, somehow, back among the elite names of the glamour division. Fury, left, was knocked down twice by Wilder but otherwise dominated Wilder showed why he is champion. Even when frustrated by his opponent, he found a way to deliver crucial blows. His performance - and this captivating bout - will do his profile no harm in the US. The heavyweight scene has stagnated in the country but Warren said Las Vegas would be desperate for a rematch, while a UK meeting would undoubtedly sell out a stadium. Fury earned a reported Â£7m for his work, Wilder Â£3m more. Both men remain undefeated. They will earn even more when it happens again. After an incredible night of drama which delivered on the hype, surely it has to? Promoter Frank Warren on BT Sport Box Office:""It is a draw but everyone knows [Fury] won it and we will want to do a rematch. How could a fight like this not be a rematch? It is unfinished business. ""In Britain that is an 80,000 job. Vegas will be drooling for this. When was the last time you saw a great fight in the USA."" Tyson Fury:""We're the best two heavyweights on the planet. There is another heavyweight who is a chicken. Joshua, where are you?"" Deontay Wilder:""I did not sit still, I was too hesitant, I started overthrowing the right hand. I was forcing my punches too much. ""When I rush my punches like that I'm never accurate. The rematch I guarantee I'm going to get him."" Tyson Fury's trainer Ben Davison:""I told Tyson before the fight he would beat him with his left hand. We didn't come here for money to get through the fight, we came here to win and I'm sick and gutted."" WBC president Mauricio Sulaiman to BBC Radio 5 live Sportsweek:""I think the draw is well taken. It could have gone either way. It was a great fight. The two knock-downs were the defining factor of the fight. ""Several rounds were very close - a few punches makes the difference. "" Lennon Lewis, former undisputed champion, gives his respect to Tyson Fury Manny Pacquiao, former eight-division world champion:Respect to Fury for sticking to his game plan and to Wilder for closing the gap with two huge knockdowns! Can't wait to see the rematch. Amir Khan, former unified light-welterweight world champion:What a fight. Wilder v Fury has to be up there as one of the best heavyweight fights I've seen. Well done to my friends Tyson Fury and Tony Bellew. Enjoy Christmas lads. Well deserved. Three-time NBA champion LeBron James:Man that was the funniest/craziest fight I've ever seen in my life.

"This video can not be played Sir David Attenborough addressing the climate change conference in Poland. The naturalist Sir David Attenborough has said climate change is humanity's greatest threat in thousands of years. The broadcaster said it could lead to the collapse of civilisations and the extinction of ""much of the natural world"". He was speaking at the opening ceremony of United Nations-sponsored climate talks in Katowice, Poland. The meeting is the most critical on climate change since the 2015 Paris agreement. Sir David said: ""Right now, we are facing a man-made disaster of global scale. Our greatest threat in thousands of years. Climate change. ""If we don't take action, the collapse of our civilisations and the extinction of much of the natural world is on the horizon."" The naturalist is taking up the ""People's Seat"" at the conference, called COP24. He is supposed to act as a link between the public and policy-makers at the meeting. ""The world's people have spoken. Their message is clear. Time is running out. They want you, the decision-makers, to act now,"" he said. Speaking at the opening ceremony, Antonio Guterres, UN Secretary-General, said climate change was already ""a matter of life and death"" for many countries. He explained that the world is ""nowhere near where it needs to be"" on the transition to a low-carbon economy. But the UN Secretary-General said the conference was an effort to ""right the ship"" and he would convene a climate summit next year to discuss next steps. Meanwhile, the World Bank has announced $200bn in funding over five years to support countries taking action against climate change. Climate change: Where we are in seven charts What is climate change? 'Trump effect' limits action on climate This video can not be played Climate activist: 'It's high time that Poland phased out coal' This Conference of the Parties (COP) is the first to be held since the landmark Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)reporton limiting global temperature rise to 1.5C came out in October. The IPCC stated that to keep to the 1.5C goal, governments would have to slash emissions of greenhouse gases by 45% by 2030. Buta recent studyshowed that CO2 emissions are on the rise again after stalling for four years. In an unprecedented move, four former UN climate talks presidents issued a statement on Sunday, calling for urgent action. They say ""decisive action in the next two years will be crucial"". This video can not be played Climate change: How 1.5C could change the world Meanwhile, the gap between what countries say they are doing and what needs to be done has never been wider. So urgent is the task that some negotiators began their meetings on Sunday, a day before the official start. Yes, some 29 heads of state and government are due to give statements at the opening of the meeting. The number is way down on the stellar cast that turned up in Paris in 2015, which perhaps indicates that many are seeing this as more a technical stage on the road to tackling climate change than a big bang moment. But for the likes of China and the EU, the meeting is critical. They will want to show that international co-operation can still work even in the age of President Trump. 2019 10 warmest years 10 coldest years 20th Century average Hotter Colder Source: NOAA Rather than spending all their time working on how to increase ambitions to cut carbon, conference delegates are likely to focus on trying to finalise the technical rules of how the Paris agreement will work. A collage of children's drawing about climate change laid out on a glacier in Switzerland While the agreement was ratified in record time by more than 180 countries in 2016, it doesn't become operational until 2020. Before then, delegates must sort out common rules on measuring, reporting and verifying (checking to avoid the misreporting of) greenhouse gas emissions, and on how climate finance is going to be provided. ""The rulebook is the thing that will absorb most of the negotiators' capacity at this year's COP,"" said Camilla Born, from the climate change think tank, E3G. ""It's no surprise, as agreeing the Paris rules is both technically and politically a complicated task - but it is worth it!"" What is in the Paris climate agreement? Last four years are 'world's hottest' Race to pull greenhouse gases from air Right now, that rule book runs to several hundred pages with thousands of brackets, indicating areas of dispute. Under the Paris agreement, each country decides for itself the actions it will take when it comes to cutting carbon. Some observers believe that the changed mood and the urgency of the science will prompt action. ""We are hoping that at COP24, countries will make declarations of how they will raise their ambitions by 2020. This is a very important moment,"" said Fernanda Carvalho with campaign group WWF. ""Two years is a short time span for that to happen. Countries need to act fast."" There is much frustration with the snail-like pace, especially among some campaigners who feel that the scale of the threat posed by rising temperatures hasn't been fully grasped by politicians. Greta Thunberg, who has refused to go to school in Sweden in protest over climate change, will be attending COP24 ""Governments across the world have completely failed to protect their citizens,"" said a spokesperson for Extinction Rebellion, the social movement that pushes for radical change on climate issues. ""Instead, they have pursued quick profit and big business. We need this to change. At COP24, we want to ensure that the focus is not just on getting the technical Paris rulebook as robust as possible, but also that governments do not lose sight of the bigger picture."" Others involved in the UN process say that real progress is being made in tackling one of the most complex problems ever faced by the world. ""We have a $300bn renewable energy economy at work today - it's not peanuts; it's an energy revolution that has unfolded on the back of, yes, a sometimes sticky climate negotiation process,"" said Achim Steiner, who heads the United Nations Development Programme. Many developing countries see progress on issues around finance to be critical to moving forward. They have been promised $100bn every year from 2020 as part of the Paris agreement. Some are sceptical about what they see as foot-dragging and obfuscation by richer countries when it comes to handing over the cash. Negotiators say that moving forward on finance is the lynchpin of progress in this meeting. ""A key finding of the recent IPCC report, and one that has often been overlooked, is that without a dramatic increase in the provision of climate finance, the possibility of limiting warming to 2C (to say nothing of the safer 1.5C goal) will irretrievably slip away,"" said Amjad Abdulla, chief negotiator for the Alliance of Small Island States. Yes - among government negotiators and observers alike. The fact that the conference is taking place in a strong coal region, in a city that is home to the biggest coal company in the EU, is troubling to many. The Polish government says that it is sticking with the fuel, and has announced that it is planning to invest next year in the construction of a new coal mine in Silesia. This bullish approach has drawn condemnation from some. ""Unfortunately, this week's announcement by the [meeting's] Polish presidency that it will include coal companies as sponsors of the COP sends a very worrisome signal before the conference even begins,"" said SÃ©bastien Duyck, a senior attorney at the Centre for International Environmental Law. Although the US has withdrawn from the Paris agreement, it cannot leave until 2020, so its negotiators have been taking part in meetings and have not obstructed the process. America is expected to participate in COP24. However, given the President's well known love of coal, it has been reported that the White House will once again organise a side event promoting fossil fuels.A similar event at the last COP provoked outrage from many delegates. The summit comes three years after the 2015 Paris accord on climate change, at which all countries agreed a plan to limit carbon emissions. Now is the moment governments must start deciding what to do to make sure that plan is put into effect. In graphics:Seven charts that show the rate of warming Advice:What can I do to help?

"Mr Trump (front right) met Mr Xi (front left) after the G20 summit in Buenos Aires US President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping have agreed to halt new trade tariffs for 90 days to allow for talks, the US says. At a post-G20 summit meeting in Buenos Aires, Mr Trump agreed not to boost tariffs on $200bn (Â£157bn) of Chinese goods from 10% to 25% on 1 January. China will buy a ""very substantial"" amount of agricultural, industrial and energy products, the US says. Meanwhile, Beijing says the two sides agreed to open up their markets. The Trump and Xi deal: A temporary truce It was the first face-to-face meeting between the two leaders since a trade war erupted earlier this year. The dispute broke out after Mr Trump complained China was doing nothing to cut its large surplus in bilateral trade. At the summit in Argentina's capital earlier on Saturday, the G20 leaders agreeda joint declaration that notes divisions over trade,externalbut does not criticise protectionism. Mr Trump and Mr Xi held a ""highly successful meeting"",the White House says in a statement.,external It says the US tariffs on Chinese goods will remain unchanged for 90 days, but warns: ""If at the end of this period of time, the parties are unable to reach an agreement, the 10 percent tariffs will be raised to 25 percent."" The US is the biggest export market for Chinese goods The US says China agreed to ""purchase a not yet agreed upon, but very substantial, amount of agricultural, energy, industrial, and other products from the United States to reduce the trade imbalance between our two countries"". Both sides also pledged to ""immediately begin negotiations on structural changes with respect to forced technology transfer, intellectual property protection, non-tariff barriers, cyber intrusions and cyber theft"", the White House says. President Trump said earlier this year he wanted to stop the ""unfair transfers of American technology and intellectual property to China"". According to the US, China has also signalled it will allow a tie-up between two major semiconductor manufacturers which Chinese regulators have been blocking. The White House statement said China was ""open to approving the previously unapproved Qualcomm-NXP deal"". Qualcomm - the world's biggest chipmaker - had abandoned its $44bn bid for Dutch rival NXPSemiconductors after Chinese opposition. The US also says Beijing agreed to designate Fentanyl as a controlled substance. The opioid - much of it thought to be made in China - is driving a huge rise in drug addiction in the US. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told reporters after the talks that ""the principal agreement has effectively prevented further expansion of economic friction between the two countries"". He hailed ""new space for win-win co-operation"", while Chinese state TV said negotiations would continue. US-China trade war in 300 words Both sides have imposed tariffs on billions of dollars' worth of goods. The US has hit $250bn of Chinese goods with tariffs since July, and China has retaliated by imposing duties on $110bn of US products. Mr Trump had also said that if talks in Argentina were unsuccessful, he would carry out a threat to hit the remaining $267bn of annual Chinese exports to the US with tariffs of between 10 and 25%. US-China trade divisions meantan Asian economic summit earlier this month was unable to agree a formal leaders' statementfor the first time in its history. Returning from the G20 summit on Air Force One, Mr Trump told reporters ""it's an incredible deal"" that would have an ""incredibly positive impact on farming"". ""What I'd be doing is holding back on tariffs. China will be opening up. China will be getting rid of tariffs,"" Mr Trump said. Stephen McDonell, BBC China correspondent in Beijing China has pretty much given up nothing in this deal because the future tariffs threatened from the Beijing side were retaliatory in nature and only to be applied if the United State escalated. For this it has gained a 90-day reprieve, during which time both sides have pledged to ramp up talks. When China's Foreign Minster Wang Yi spoke to reporters after the meeting he said the two leaders had agreed to open up each other's markets and that this process could lead to the resolution of ""legitimate"" US concerns. This was either an acknowledgment that Washington does have legitimate concerns or a way of differentiating those American concerns which are reasonable from those which are not actually ""legitimate"". This is not a suspension of the trade war but a suspension of the escalation of the trade war. Big questions remain about the preparedness of Beijing to allow international access to this enormous market to a level that would satisfy the Trump administration prompting a complete halt in the trade war. On other issues, the US president announced he would be ""formally terminating Nafta [the North American Free Trade Agreement] shortly"". Mr Trump (C) earlier signed a new trade agreement on Friday with his Mexican and Canadian counterparts This would give lawmakers six months, he said, to approve a new trade deal agreed with his Mexican and Canadian counterparts on Friday or revert to trade rules from before 1994, when Nafta took effect. Trump expects second Kim summit soon Trump claims progress after Kim summit He also said he was likely to meet North Korean Leader Kim Jong-un in January or February and three locations for their second meeting were being considered. Mr Trump added that he would also invite Mr Kim, with whom he has ""a good relationship"", to the US at some point. French leader Emmanuel Macron told reporters that the World Trade Organization, the body that regulates trade disputes, needed to be modernised. A senior US official told Reuters that it was the first time that the G20 had recognised that the WTO was ""currently falling short of meeting its objectives"" and needed reform. China v the US: Not just a trade war Erdogan demands Khashoggi extraditions On Friday Mr Trump briefly met Russian President Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of the G20, a Russian official told Reuters. Earlier the US president said he had postponed a planned press conference ""out of respect for the Bush family"", following the death of former President George HW Bush, at the age of 94. Earlier on in the summit, emerging economies denounced protectionism. Trump talks tough on China before G20 US-China trade row: What has happened so far?

"Parents should not expect schools to police children's eating and exercise, or toilet train pupils, Ofsted boss Amanda Spielman will say this week. England's chief inspector for schools will argue the answer to the obesity crisis lies in the home, and parents should not ""abdicate responsibility"". Neither can schools be a ""panacea"" for knife crime or child neglect, she will add in her second annual report. Two studies have this year queried the benefit of school anti-obesity schemes. In February, the British Medical Journal reported that a year-long anti-obesity programme involving more than 600 West Midlands primary school pupilsyielded no improvements. And in July an Ofsted study of 60 schools found no link between efforts to tackle obesity and pupils' weight. What does it mean if a child is 'severely obese'? Schools alone cannot fix childhood obesity - Ofsted boss Childhood obesity: combating 'pester power' Ms Spielman, who will present Ofsted's annual report on Tuesday, will highlight concerns that - by the time they start primary school - almost a quarter of children in England are overweight or obese. This rises to over a third by the time they move on to secondary school. ""Schools can and should teach children about the importance of healthy eating and exercise in line with their core purpose; their PE lessons should get them out of breath,"" she will say. ""But beyond that, schools cannot take over the role of health professionals - and above all parents."" Highlighting the growing evidence of children arriving at reception unable to use a toilet, she will add: ""This is difficult for teachers, disruptive for other children and has a terrible social impact on the children affected."" Ms Spielman will also argue that by expecting schools to tackle gang-related crime or child neglect, society risks not only distracting them from their core purpose but also failing to solve the problems. Such complex matters need to be dealt with by those with the correct knowledge and expertise, she will argue. ""While schools can play a role in educating young people about the danger of knives, they cannot be a panacea for this particular societal ill,"" she will say. ""Instead, preventing knife crime requires all local safeguarding partners to work together to protect children from harm whilst the relevant agencies tackle criminal activity.""

"Timur Siraziev's report from outside the Berkshire base was broadcast on Russia's Channel One The defence secretary has called on the public to report suspicious activity near military sites after a Russian TV crew prompted an alert at an Army base. Gavin Williamson issued the warning after Timur Siraziev, of Channel One, was seen outside 77 Brigade's Berkshire base, theMail on Sunday reported,external. The unit works in social media and psychological operations. The MoD said Mr Siraziev's ""suspicious"" behaviour was monitored by the base's security systems. Russia's Channel One later broadcast a report by Mr Siraziev containing footage apparently filmed from a vehicle as it passed the barracks in Hermitage on 21 November. He is also shown speaking on camera as he walks close to an entrance to the base. Russia 'bigger threat than IS' - Army chief Inside Army 'psy-ops' headquarters The Mail on Sunday said the security alert warns troops not to approach Mr Siraziev or engage him in conversation if they are alone but to contact police immediately. Mr Williamson said: ""We take the security of our bases and personnel incredibly seriously. ""If a member of the public sees anyone acting suspiciously in or around a military base it should be reported to the police as a matter of urgency."" With UK-Russian relations frosty in the wake of theSalisbury Novichok poisoning, GCHQ chief Jeremy Fleming warned earlier this year that Moscow posed a ""real"" and ""active"" threat to the international community. Last month, the head of the Army, Gen Mark Carleton-Smith, described Russia as a ""far greater threat"" to UK security than the Islamic State group. Mr Siraziev is listed on the Russian Embassy's website as Channel One's bureau chief. When set up in 2015,77 Brigade was touted as a unitthat would help the UK to fight wars in the ""information age"" by helping to win hearts and minds. It includes both regular troops and reservists. Head of the Army at the time, Gen Sir Nick Carter, said the move was about trying to operate ""smarter"".

"Ted Baker founder Ray Kelvin famously refuses to show his full face in photos Staff at fashion group Ted Baker allege there is a culture of ""forced hugging"" by the firm's founder and boss, which they are now demanding be ended. A petition, launched by an employee, also accuses 62-year-old Ray Kelvin of inappropriate comments and behaviour. ""It is part of a culture that leaves harassment unchallenged,"" they claim. The company, which issues a trading update on Thursday, says hugs are ""part of Ted Baker's culture, but are absolutely not insisted upon"". It said Mr Kelvin greeted many people with a hug, ""be it a shareholder, investor, supplier, partner, customer or colleague"". The petition on the workplace website Organise had more than 2,000 signatures by Sunday evening. It is also claimed that as well as engaging them in unwelcome embraces, the brand's founder asked young female members of staff to sit on his knee, cuddle him, or let him massage their ears. They also allege that millionaire Mr Kelvin, who launched Ted Baker more than 30 years ago, regularly uses sexual innuendo. But Ted Baker also said that the matters raised in the petition were ""at odds with the values of our business and those of our CEO"". And it said it would ""ensure a thorough independent investigation is carried out"" into the allegations. Another complaint made in the petition is that previous complaints have been ignored. ""Please set up a way of reporting harassment to an independent, external body - HR has done nothing with the reports of harassment to date,"" says the petition. But the firm said there were ""very clear and robust HR policies in place to provide all employees with a wide range of reporting options for any issues that they might encounter, including a completely confidential and anonymous, 24/7 helpline"". Ted Baker, named after a fictitious alter ego of Mr Kelvin, opened its first store in Glasgow in 1988 and now has 544 outlets worldwide selling fashion and accessories. Mr Kelvin is worth Â£522m according to the Sunday Times Rich List.

The NYPD tweeted on Sunday that arrangements were being made to return the ring to the pair, who are from the UK. CCTV images showed the couple unsuccessfully trying to retrieve the piece of jewellery. But police officers later managed to rescue and clean it.

The man then lies down on the floor by the grate, trying to reach the piece of jewellery but again they are unable to retrieve it. Officers from the New York Police Department clearly have a romantic side and, more importantly, access to the grate, so could get it out quite easily. Earlier, they had put out a plea for the man and woman to come forward. Later on Sunday they released an image of the cleaned-up ring on their Twitter account with the caption: ""Here's a photo of the ring our officers recovered (and cleaned!)

"Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife Sara are suspected of awarding regulatory favours to a telecom firm Israeli police have recommended indicting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife Sara for alleged fraud and bribery. They are suspected of awarding regulatory favours to the Bezeq telecom firm in return for positive media coverage of the couple. Mr Netanyahu rejected the allegations in what is known as Case 4000. The Israeli attorney-general will now have to decide whether to bring charges in the case. Israel's dilemma over 'magician' Netanyahu's future Netanyahu: The commando turned PM In February, police recommended indicting Mr Netanyahu in two other corruption investigations. On Sunday, the Israeli police and the Israel Securities Authorities said there was sufficient evidence for bribery, fraud and breach-of-trust charges to be brought against Mr Netanyahu and his wife. They are suspected of interfering in regulatory decisions that favoured Bezeq and its majority shareholder Shaul Elovitch. In return, the couple are alleged to have been given more positive coverage on Walla! news website, owned by Bezeq. The police also said there was sufficient evidence to indict Mr Elovitch for giving bribes. Responding to the latest allegations, Mr Netanyahu tweeted: ""These recommendations were determined and leaked even before the investigations began. ""I'm sure that in this case the relevant authorities, after examining the issue, will reach the same conclusion: that there was nothing because there is nothing."" Mr Elovitch has so far made no public comments on the issue. One of them centres on an allegation that Mr Netanyahu asked the publisher of an Israeli newspaper, Yediot Aharonot, for positive coverage in exchange for help in reining in a rival publication. In the second case, Mr Netanyahu is suspected of receiving gifts worth at least a million shekels ($270,000; Â£210,000) from Hollywood mogul Arnon Milchan and other supporters. The Jerusalem Post reported earlier this year that the gifts included champagne and cigars, and were given in exchange for help getting Mr Milchan a US visa. Mr Netanyahu has dismissed all the allegations as ""baseless"". Israeli media say the 69-year-old prime minister has been questioned by investigators a number of times. Mr Netanyahu heads a fragile coalition, but he appears confident the allegations will not spur early elections. The next legislative poll is scheduled for November 2019.

"This video can not be played The Met said drivers aim to end pursuits before riders or members of the public are injured Theresa May has backed ""robust"" police tactics for dealing with criminals who use mopeds to commit crimes such as snatching bags or phones. Footage of police ramming vehicles into scooters to knock off suspects provoked controversy, with the Met Police saying two thieves had broken bones. The Independent Office for Police Conduct has said it is investigating three cases of ""tactical contact"". But when asked about the approach, the PM said it was ""absolutely right"". ""These people on these mopeds are acting unlawfully and committing crimes and I think it's absolutely right that we see a robust police response to that,"" she said, when asked about the issue during her trip to the G20 summit in Argentina.

My life behind the wheel, by police pursuit driver London moped crime hotspots: check your area Senior officers defended the tactic after releasing footage of incidents involving specially-trained drivers, saying it was needed to stop dangerous chases and had helped reduce moped-enabled crime in London by over a third. But Labour has raised concerns about the approach, which MP Diane Abbott said earlier this week was ""potentially very dangerous"". ""It shouldn't be legal for anyone,"" tweeted the shadow home secretary. ""Police are not above the law."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Sajid Javid, who revealed in June that his phone was taken in a moped mugging before he became home secretary, challenged Ms Abbott's view. ""Risk-assessed tactical contact is exactly what we need,"" hetweeted,external. ""Criminals are not above the law."" However, the Metropolitan Police Federation - which represents rank-and-file officers - havewarned that officers could be riskingtheir ""livelihood and liberty"" by using the tactic. Legislation was necessary to ensure police officers were not prosecuted ""for doing their job"", it argued. The Metropolitan Police has said there is no maximum speed for police cars to hit mopeds, and that it is a common misconception among moped thieves that officers will end their pursuit if the suspect drives dangerously or removes their helmet. Scotland Yard has previously said moped crime can happen ""at any time of the day or night"", with some criminals stealing up to 30 phones in an hour.

"A statue of Marianne, a symbol in France, was vandalised inside the Arc de Triomphe French President Emmanuel Macron has held an urgent security meeting following a day of riots by thousands of anti-government protesters. Ministers said that while no options had been ruled out, imposing a state of emergency had not been discussed during the talks - despite earlier reports. Protests over fuel tax have grown into general anger at higher living costs. Three people have been killed in the protests since demonstrations started more than two weeks ago, police said. Justice Minister Nicole Belloubet has promised to bring the full force of the law to bear on people who are found to have resorted to violence. Before the security meeting on Sunday, Mr Macron inspected some of the damage caused in the disturbances, which had centred on Paris. More than 100 people were injured in the city, including 23 members of the security forces, and nearly 400 people were arrested, police said. Vehicles in the streets of Paris were torched and some 400 arrests were made Mr Macron assesses damage caused during the ""gilets jaunes"" protests near the Champs-ElysÃ©es Mr Macron visited the Champs-ElysÃ©es and the Arc de Triomphe, which was scaled by demonstrators on Saturday. He later chaired an urgent meeting at the presidential palace, involving the interior minister and top security service officials. Will Macron face down French fuel protesters? Jobseeker: Macron should help me find work France's interior ministry says about 136,000 people took part in the protests nationwide, showing widespread support for the movement known as the ""gilets jaunes"" (yellow vests). This video can not be played Dozens of people were injured in Saturday's clashes Government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux earlier told Europe 1 radio that a state-of-emergency declaration was a possible option. ""We have to think about the measures that can be taken so that these incidents don't happen again,"" he said. The ""gilets jaunes"" protesters, so-called because they have taken to the streets wearing the high-visibility yellow clothing that is required to be carried in every vehicle by French law, are complaining at a sharp increase in diesel taxes. Mr Macron says his motivation for the increase is environmental, but protesters call him out of touch - particularly with non-city dwellers who rely on their cars. This video can not be played France fuel protests: Who are the people in the yellow vests? The protest movement has no identifiable leadership and has gained momentum via social media, encompassing a whole range of participants from the anarchist far left to the nationalist far right, and plenty of moderates in between. Nearly 300,000 people took part in the first country-wide demonstration, on 17 November. By Hugh Schofield, Paris correspondent Coming straight from the airport, the president was greeted with cheers but also boos as he looked at the wreckage of burnt-out cars and smashed windows on the Avenue KlÃ©ber. At the Arc de Triomphe, he saw the graffiti targeting him and his government sprayed on the outside, and inside the devastation in the ticketing and reception areas, which had been ransacked by rioters. The president and his ministers must now decide what action to take in response to a turn of events that in its drama and violence has shocked the country. He may be hoping that the wanton destruction in the capital marks a turning point, and that many ordinary ""yellow vests"" will now feel they have had enough. If so, that might be a rash calculation. The bigger point is their grievances over rising taxes and falling standards of living, and they still have plenty of support. The ""yellow vest"" protesters rallied for a third weekend on Saturday, taking to the streets across the country, including in Narbonne, Nantes and Marseille. One driver died in an accident at a protesters' blockade in Arles, after a car collided with a heavy goods vehicle, a gendarmerie official told Reuters news agency. Riot police were splattered with yellow paint On the Champs-ElysÃ©es in central Paris, police fired tear gas, stun grenades and water cannon, while masked protesters hurled projectiles and set buildings on fire. Nearly 190 fires were put out and six buildings were set ablaze, the interior ministry said. Department stores and metro stations were closed as a result of the violence. ""I will never accept violence,"" Mr Macron told a news conference in Buenos Aires on Saturday. ""No cause justifies that authorities are attacked, that businesses are plundered, that passers-by or journalists are threatened or that the Arc du Triomphe is defiled,"" he said. He has long maintained that his fuel policies are needed to combat global warming and has accused his political opponents of hijacking the movement in order to block his reform programme. Earlier this week,Mr Macron tried to strike a conciliatory tone, saying he was open to ideas about how the fuel tax could be applied. The price of diesel, the most commonly used fuel in French cars, has risen by around 23% over the past 12 months to an average of â¬1.51 (Â£1.32; $1.71) per litre, its highest point since the early 2000s. World oil prices did rise before falling back again but the Macron government raised its hydrocarbon tax this year by 7.6 cents per litre on diesel and 3.9 cents on petrol, as part of a campaign for cleaner cars and fuel. The decision to impose a further increase of 6.5 cents on diesel and 2.9 cents on petrol on 1 January 2019 was seen as the final straw. The clean-up is under way.

"Other parties reject the idea of a May-Corbyn head-to-head debate as they want a chance to have their say too Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has accepted Theresa May's challenge of a TV Brexit debate on the BBC - but only if it is the two leaders head-to-head. Mr Corbyn had previously claimed he preferred the bid from broadcaster ITV, but Mrs May wanted the BBC to host it. In a statement on Saturday, the BBC said its proposal includes a one-on-one debate as well as a chance to hear from ""a wider range of voices"". Other parties say they want to be part of any Brexit TV debate. The BBC's debate would take part on Sunday 9 December, two days before MPs are due to vote the government's Brexit deal. Labour, the Lib Dems, the SNP, the DUP and many Tory MPs have said they will vote against the agreement, which has already been agreed between the UK and EU. Brexit: A really simple guide Can May get Brexit deal through Commons? Clash over who screens Brexit TV debate Mrs May accepted the BBC's offer to take part in the debate earlier this week. Mr Corbyn said he preferred ITV's bid out of ""respect"" for viewers who wanted to watch the I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! final on ITV the same evening. But in a tweet on Saturday,  he said: ""Theresa May said she wanted a head to head debate with me on her botched Brexit deal and I am ready to do that. ""ITV have a straightforward plan.

"Mr Trump (front right) met Mr Xi (front left) after the G20 summit in Buenos Aires US President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping have agreed to halt new trade tariffs for 90 days to allow for talks, the US says. At a post-G20 summit meeting in Buenos Aires, Mr Trump agreed not to boost tariffs on $200bn (Â£157bn) of Chinese goods from 10% to 25% on 1 January. China will buy a ""very substantial"" amount of agricultural, industrial and energy products, the US says. Meanwhile, Beijing says the two sides agreed to open up their markets. The Trump and Xi deal: A temporary truce It was the first face-to-face meeting between the two leaders since a trade war erupted earlier this year. The dispute broke out after Mr Trump complained China was doing nothing to cut its large surplus in bilateral trade. At the summit in Argentina's capital earlier on Saturday, the G20 leaders agreeda joint declaration that notes divisions over trade,externalbut does not criticise protectionism. Mr Trump and Mr Xi held a ""highly successful meeting"",the White House says in a statement.,external It says the US tariffs on Chinese goods will remain unchanged for 90 days, but warns: ""If at the end of this period of time, the parties are unable to reach an agreement, the 10 percent tariffs will be raised to 25 percent."" The US is the biggest export market for Chinese goods The US says China agreed to ""purchase a not yet agreed upon, but very substantial, amount of agricultural, energy, industrial, and other products from the United States to reduce the trade imbalance between our two countries"". Both sides also pledged to ""immediately begin negotiations on structural changes with respect to forced technology transfer, intellectual property protection, non-tariff barriers, cyber intrusions and cyber theft"", the White House says. President Trump said earlier this year he wanted to stop the ""unfair transfers of American technology and intellectual property to China"". According to the US, China has also signalled it will allow a tie-up between two major semiconductor manufacturers which Chinese regulators have been blocking. The White House statement said China was ""open to approving the previously unapproved Qualcomm-NXP deal"". Qualcomm - the world's biggest chipmaker - had abandoned its $44bn bid for Dutch rival NXPSemiconductors after Chinese opposition. The US also says Beijing agreed to designate Fentanyl as a controlled substance. The opioid - much of it thought to be made in China - is driving a huge rise in drug addiction in the US. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told reporters after the talks that ""the principal agreement has effectively prevented further expansion of economic friction between the two countries"". He hailed ""new space for win-win co-operation"", while Chinese state TV said negotiations would continue. US-China trade war in 300 words Both sides have imposed tariffs on billions of dollars' worth of goods. The US has hit $250bn of Chinese goods with tariffs since July, and China has retaliated by imposing duties on $110bn of US products. Mr Trump had also said that if talks in Argentina were unsuccessful, he would carry out a threat to hit the remaining $267bn of annual Chinese exports to the US with tariffs of between 10 and 25%. US-China trade divisions meantan Asian economic summit earlier this month was unable to agree a formal leaders' statementfor the first time in its history. Returning from the G20 summit on Air Force One, Mr Trump told reporters ""it's an incredible deal"" that would have an ""incredibly positive impact on farming"". ""What I'd be doing is holding back on tariffs. China will be opening up. China will be getting rid of tariffs,"" Mr Trump said. Stephen McDonell, BBC China correspondent in Beijing China has pretty much given up nothing in this deal because the future tariffs threatened from the Beijing side were retaliatory in nature and only to be applied if the United State escalated. For this it has gained a 90-day reprieve, during which time both sides have pledged to ramp up talks. When China's Foreign Minster Wang Yi spoke to reporters after the meeting he said the two leaders had agreed to open up each other's markets and that this process could lead to the resolution of ""legitimate"" US concerns. This was either an acknowledgment that Washington does have legitimate concerns or a way of differentiating those American concerns which are reasonable from those which are not actually ""legitimate"". This is not a suspension of the trade war but a suspension of the escalation of the trade war. Big questions remain about the preparedness of Beijing to allow international access to this enormous market to a level that would satisfy the Trump administration prompting a complete halt in the trade war. On other issues, the US president announced he would be ""formally terminating Nafta [the North American Free Trade Agreement] shortly"". Mr Trump (C) earlier signed a new trade agreement on Friday with his Mexican and Canadian counterparts This would give lawmakers six months, he said, to approve a new trade deal agreed with his Mexican and Canadian counterparts on Friday or revert to trade rules from before 1994, when Nafta took effect. Trump expects second Kim summit soon Trump claims progress after Kim summit He also said he was likely to meet North Korean Leader Kim Jong-un in January or February and three locations for their second meeting were being considered. Mr Trump added that he would also invite Mr Kim, with whom he has ""a good relationship"", to the US at some point. French leader Emmanuel Macron told reporters that the World Trade Organization, the body that regulates trade disputes, needed to be modernised. A senior US official told Reuters that it was the first time that the G20 had recognised that the WTO was ""currently falling short of meeting its objectives"" and needed reform. China v the US: Not just a trade war Erdogan demands Khashoggi extraditions On Friday Mr Trump briefly met Russian President Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of the G20, a Russian official told Reuters. Earlier the US president said he had postponed a planned press conference ""out of respect for the Bush family"", following the death of former President George HW Bush, at the age of 94. Earlier on in the summit, emerging economies denounced protectionism. Trump talks tough on China before G20 US-China trade row: What has happened so far?

"This video can not be played Fury v Wilder: 'The division is alive again' - how the dramatic final round unfolded Tyson Fury's shot at completing a remarkable return to the top of world boxing saw him survive two knockdowns in an enthralling draw with WBC heavyweight champion Deontay Wilder in Los Angeles. In one of the most thrilling heavyweight contests for years, the Briton was floored in the ninth round and brutally dropped in the 12th, somehow regaining his feet to survive for two minutes. Fury had shown plenty of the evasive, counter-punching skill that made his name before his 30-month spell away from the sport and he enjoyed success in the middle rounds. Wilder v Fury: Listen again and relive the drama as it unfolded 'It happened to me and I knew it would happen to him': Lennox Lewis on controversial decision 'This was the best boxing comeback in history' - Fury calls for rematch with Wilder Wilder v Fury: 'The division is alive again' - how the dramatic final round unfolded Listen: Wilder v Fury: One for the ages - 5 live podcast But in the 12th he lay motionless after a savage combination, barely making the count to see out the contest, which was scored 115-111 for Wilder, 114-112 for Fury and 113-113. Fury - and much of the ringside media - felt he had won and had he stayed on his feet in the final three minutes, the WBC title would have been his. After 36 minutes of the most tense and absorbing action, both men spoke of a rematch, which appears a certainty. Fury, whose promoter Frank Warren claimed ""everyone knows"" his man had won, said: ""We're on away soil. I got knocked down but I still believe I won the fight. I'm showing total professionalism. ""The Gypsy King has returned. I'm a professional athlete who loves to fight. He is a fearsome fighter. The world knows the truth."" Wilder said his two knockdowns meant he ""definitely won the fight"". ""I don't know if [a rematch] will be my next fight but would love it to be. We need to do it again."" Fury got up from his final-round knockdown with the referee's count at nine Those at ringside - who included boxing greats Floyd Mayweather, Evander Holyfield, Lennox Lewis and James 'Buster' Douglas, as well as actress Hayden Panettiere and footballer Zlatan Ibrahimovic - were left asking the same question after the fight: how did Tyson Fury get up? The right hand and left hook Wilder landed cleanly in the final round were crushing and looked certain to have ended the contest. ""I saw his eyes roll into the back of his head. I was like it's over,"" Wilder said afterwards. It would have been cruel. The 17,698 in the Staples Center had seen Fury contribute immensely, landing punches time and again and goading his rival. Wilder's ring walk was accompanied by his WBC belt being lowered into the ring under spotlight, while Fury worked pads with trainer Ben Davison, seemingly oblivious to the spectacle. The Briton frustrated his big-hitting American counterpart but produced blows of his own, landing a stunning left-right in the seventh that prompted Wilder to give chase and swing to no avail as Fury evaded. But the threat from a man with 39 knockout wins remained always in evidence, as some at ringside watched through their hands. The power punches duly came, a chopping right hand behind Fury's ear sending the Briton down in round nine. He held on, ducked, bravely punched back and survived, somehow. And so to the 12th, three minutes few will forget. Wilder looked a little stunned to see his rival come back for more after crashing to the mat and the bell brought roars of appreciation from the crowd. Mike Costello, BBC boxing correspondent This has been a memorable night here in Los Angeles - be in no doubt that the heavyweight division is alive and well again. It has been such a compelling night with Fury in control for so, so long. He was almost in tears here at ringside as he took a warm embrace from his brother. This has been a long road back for him in so many ways. If you are looking at the images of him being pounded to the canvas, you cannot believe how the man rose to his feet after a colossal right hand from Deontay Wilder. The noisy singing of God Save The Queen at the Staples Center was evidence of a healthy British support in the arena - and, indeed, Fury has re-emerged as something of a people's champion after time spent away from the sport to overcome depression, during which he also accepted a backdated two-year UK Anti-Doping ban. But two routine wins since his June return taught little, and his 10-stone weight drop proved more of a talking point than his performances. Fury was an underdog with bookmakers, and his own team admitted this challenge had come six months sooner than they would have preferred. But he took a chance, knowing it could be a fleeting one, given the clamour for Wilder to face Anthony Joshua in a bout for all four world titles. After this display, he has shown he is legitimately back in the mix. The man who held three world titles after his surprise victory over Wladimir Klitschko in 2015 showed his trademark body and head movement, and frequently flummoxed Wilder with his quick feet and counter-punching. The jab was slick, his right hand landed frequently, and despite the dramatic weight loss, his punch resistance and durability were truly remarkable. One of Wilder's team likened Fury to WWE wrestler The Undertaker, such was his 12th-round 'back-from-the-dead' recovery. It has been a remarkable three years. From world champion to depression, and ballooning to 28 stone, Fury is, somehow, back among the elite names of the glamour division. Fury, left, was knocked down twice by Wilder but otherwise dominated Wilder showed why he is champion. Even when frustrated by his opponent, he found a way to deliver crucial blows. His performance - and this captivating bout - will do his profile no harm in the US. The heavyweight scene has stagnated in the country but Warren said Las Vegas would be desperate for a rematch, while a UK meeting would undoubtedly sell out a stadium. Fury earned a reported Â£7m for his work, Wilder Â£3m more. Both men remain undefeated. They will earn even more when it happens again. After an incredible night of drama which delivered on the hype, surely it has to? Promoter Frank Warren on BT Sport Box Office:""It is a draw but everyone knows [Fury] won it and we will want to do a rematch. How could a fight like this not be a rematch? It is unfinished business. ""In Britain that is an 80,000 job. Vegas will be drooling for this. When was the last time you saw a great fight in the USA."" Tyson Fury:""We're the best two heavyweights on the planet. There is another heavyweight who is a chicken. Joshua, where are you?"" Deontay Wilder:""I did not sit still, I was too hesitant, I started overthrowing the right hand. I was forcing my punches too much. ""When I rush my punches like that I'm never accurate. The rematch I guarantee I'm going to get him."" Tyson Fury's trainer Ben Davison:""I told Tyson before the fight he would beat him with his left hand. We didn't come here for money to get through the fight, we came here to win and I'm sick and gutted."" WBC president Mauricio Sulaiman to BBC Radio 5 live Sportsweek:""I think the draw is well taken. It could have gone either way. It was a great fight. The two knock-downs were the defining factor of the fight. ""Several rounds were very close - a few punches makes the difference. "" Lennon Lewis, former undisputed champion, gives his respect to Tyson Fury Manny Pacquiao, former eight-division world champion:Respect to Fury for sticking to his game plan and to Wilder for closing the gap with two huge knockdowns! Can't wait to see the rematch. Amir Khan, former unified light-welterweight world champion:What a fight. Wilder v Fury has to be up there as one of the best heavyweight fights I've seen. Well done to my friends Tyson Fury and Tony Bellew. Enjoy Christmas lads. Well deserved. Three-time NBA champion LeBron James:Man that was the funniest/craziest fight I've ever seen in my life. What the H-E-L-L just happened? Manchester United legend Rio Ferdinand:As a sportsman what Tyson Fury has done tonight must be respected. What he has been through in his personal life, to put in a performance like that.

"Parents should not expect schools to police children's eating and exercise, or toilet train pupils, Ofsted boss Amanda Spielman will say this week. England's chief inspector for schools will argue the answer to the obesity crisis lies in the home, and parents should not ""abdicate responsibility"". Neither can schools be a ""panacea"" for knife crime or child neglect, she will add in her second annual report. Two studies have this year queried the benefit of school anti-obesity schemes. In February, the British Medical Journal reported that a year-long anti-obesity programme involving more than 600 West Midlands primary school pupilsyielded no improvements. And in July an Ofsted study of 60 schools found no link between efforts to tackle obesity and pupils' weight. What does it mean if a child is 'severely obese'? Schools alone cannot fix childhood obesity - Ofsted boss Childhood obesity: combating 'pester power' Ms Spielman, who will present Ofsted's annual report on Tuesday, will highlight concerns that - by the time they start primary school - almost a quarter of children in England are overweight or obese. This rises to over a third by the time they move on to secondary school. ""Schools can and should teach children about the importance of healthy eating and exercise in line with their core purpose; their PE lessons should get them out of breath,"" she will say. ""But beyond that, schools cannot take over the role of health professionals - and above all parents."" Highlighting the growing evidence of children arriving at reception unable to use a toilet, she will add: ""This is difficult for teachers, disruptive for other children and has a terrible social impact on the children affected."" Ms Spielman will also argue that by expecting schools to tackle gang-related crime or child neglect, society risks not only distracting them from their core purpose but also failing to solve the problems. Such complex matters need to be dealt with by those with the correct knowledge and expertise, she will argue. ""While schools can play a role in educating young people about the danger of knives, they cannot be a panacea for this particular societal ill,"" she will say. ""Instead, preventing knife crime requires all local safeguarding partners to work together to protect children from harm whilst the relevant agencies tackle criminal activity.""

"This video can not be played Michael Gove: ""I'm supporting the prime minister"" If MPs don't back Theresa May's Brexit deal there could be another EU referendum, Michael Gove has said. The leading cabinet Brexiteer said Mrs May's deal was not perfect - but if MPs did not vote it through on 11 December there was a risk of ""no Brexit at all"". He told the BBC's Andrew Marr show there may now be a Commons majority for another referendum. Labour has said it will attempt to topple Mrs May and force a general election if MPs reject her deal. If that fails, they will then seek support in the Commons for another referendum. Michael Gove insisted Mrs May could still win the vote on 11 December despite dozens of her own MPs being against her EU deal. Corbyn will do BBC debate if head-to-head Another referendum 'may be PM's only option' Brexit: A really simple guide SNP will support bid to put Brexit on hold The environment secretary told the BBC that winning the Commons vote would be ""challenging"". But although Mrs May's deal was not perfect, ""we have got to recognise that if we don't vote for this, the alternatives are no deal or no Brexit"". ""There is a real risk if we don't vote for this deal there may be a majority in the House of Commons for a second referendum,"" said Mr Gove, a leading figure in the 2016 Leave campaign. Asked if Mrs May would have to stand down as PM if she lost the vote on her deal in nine days' time, he said: ""Absolutely not."" He claimed there was a ""strong movement behind the prime minister"" among the public. Labour has said it will table a no confidence motion in the government if MPs vote down the deal in a bid to topple Mrs May and force a general election. Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said: ""If the prime minister has lost a vote of that significance then there has to be a question of confidence in the government. ""I think it's inevitable that we would seek to move that,"" he added. Under the Fixed Term Parliament Act, if the government loses a vote on a motion of no confidence it has 14 days to pass a second confidence motion, or Parliament is dissolved and a general election is called. If Labour fails to force a general election it will seek support in the Commons for another EU referendum. Mr Gyimah said he would be voting against Mrs May's Brexit deal Conservative support for a further referendum is growing -science minister Sam Gyimahquit the government on Saturday to join the People's Vote campaign. A cross-party group of 17 MPs,in a letter published in the Observer,,externalhas also called for Parliament to support another referendum at the earliest opportunity. But a referendum can only be held if the government legislates for one and a majority of MPs vote for it. The People's Vote campaign, which is backed by about 30 Labour MPs, a smaller number of Conservatives, the Lib Dems, the SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Greens, argue that the public must be given the final say on the terms of Britain's exit, now that they know what the deal is. Following Michael Gove's comments on the Marr show, Lib Dem Brexit spokesman Tom Brake said: ""The government has made a Horlicks out of Brexit and now one of its chief architects has admitted that the final say might go back to the people."" He said the Lib Dems and ""many others"" will ""demand a People's Vote with an option to remain in the EU"". Labour's shadow international development secretary Barry Gardiner told Andrew Marr he thought ""remain and no-deal"" would have to be ""on the table"" in any referendum. But Sir Keir Starmer told Sky News he would be ""worried"" about no-deal being on the ballot paper, as it would be ""catastrophic"" for the country. Michael Gove claimed the Leave campaign would probably win a fresh referendum by an even larger margin but holding one would ""damage faith in democracy and rip apart the social fabric"" of the country. Many Leave voters would see it is a ""condescending"" move by the political establishment, who would effectively be saying people were ""too thick to make a decision"" the first time around, he told Andrew Marr. This video can not be played Asked about the legacy she'd like to leave as PM, Mrs May says there's ""a lot more for me still to do"". By Laura Kuenssberg, BBC political editor Support for the prime minister's Brexit compromise seems to be shrinking, rather than growing. If Theresa May acknowledges it in private, she certainly won't touch that notion in public. Read more from Laura here The government claims the chances of Britain leaving the EU on 29 March without a deal are more likely if MPs reject Mrs May's deal. Mr Gove said there would not be another Commons vote on the deal if MPs voted it down on 11 December - something Mrs May has previously refused to rule out. There has been speculation the prime minister could return to Brussels to ask for the deal to be modified to reflect MPs' concerns before putting it to another Commons vote. The EU has said the deal it has agreed with Mrs May is their final offer and it will not be renegotiated. Dominic Raab claims the Irish backstop would be indefinite They argue the UK will be kept tied to the EU with no say in its rules until Brussels decides it can leave, under the terms of the Northern Irish ""backstop"". Mrs May insists the backstop, which is designed to keep the Irish border open until the UK can agree a free trade deal with the EU, would be temporary. However, her former Brexit secretaryDominic Raab told the Sunday Times,externalthe backstop would last indefinitely - for as long as it takes to negotiate a new UK-EU relationship - ""unless the EU allows us to exit"". Michael Gove told Andrew Marr he was also uncomfortable about the ""backstop"" but it would be temporary. This was because it would hand the UK economy a ""competitive advantage"" over the remaining 27 EU nations, he argued. Sir Keir Starmer is pressing for contempt of Parliament proceedings Opponents of Theresa May's Brexit deal believe the UK's chief law officer, Geoffrey Cox, has advised the government that the Northern Ireland ""backstop"" would continue indefinitely. They think this is why the government is refusing to publish Mr Cox's legal advice on the EU withdrawal agreement in full - as it would make it even harder for her to convince MPs to back her deal. The government insists such legal advice is always confidential - and that MPs will be able to question Mr Cox about it on Monday, when he makes a statement to the Commons. MPs will start five days of debate on the deal on Tuesday. But Labour is spearheading a cross-party effort - including the government's partners the DUP - to force the legal advice to be published, ahead of the debate. Sir Keir, a former director of public prosecutions, said the opposition parties would press for contempt of Parliament proceedings if MPs are not shown the advice. If contempt proceedings were requested, it would be up to Commons Speaker John Bercow to decide whether a debate and vote should be held.

"Almost 60% more children in their last year of primary school are classified as ""severely obese"" than in their first year, according to Public Health England figures for England and Wales. The Local Government Association (LGA) said this showschildren are becoming fatter as they go through school. But what does ""severely obese"" mean? Every year, Public Health England - part of the Department of Health and Social Care - measures children aged four and five, and children aged 10 and 11 in England. This year, for the first time, they included a ""severely obese"" category. It defined severe obesity as children in the heaviest 0.4% of weights for their age. For adults, healthy weight is determined using body mass index (BMI) - a calculation based on their height and weight.If you are over a fixed weight for your height, you will be considered obese. But for children under 18, because they're still growing, their BMI is compared with a sample of heights and weights of other children their age and sex, to work out where they are compared with a typical child. Public Health England, which is responsible for overseeing national programmes on obesity, uses a measurement known as the UK90, which is based on the measurements of British children and young adults from nought to 23 years old collected between 1978 and 1994. They use these measurements from several decades ago in part to create a fixed point of comparison, so that while the population as a whole gets heavier, the threshold of what we consider healthy doesn't creep up. Public Health England says that any child whose BMI is higher than 95% of measurements for their age and sex, according to the UK90, is obese. A large representative sample of British children and young people were measured to work out a typical range of weights at each age. These weights where then divided into 100 equal bands or ""percentiles"". Any children in the 95th percentile of weights or above would be considered obese. And those with measurements above 99.6% are ""severely obese"". We know that last year, about 60,000 children at the end of primary school in England and Wales were obese, of whom 22,000 were classed as ""severely obese"". What's harder to know is whether that's a fair cut-off point at which those children should be dubbed obese and considered at risk of ill-health. Critics of the 95% measurement say it brands a group of children as obese unnecessarily. Christopher Snowdon, at the Institute of Economic Affairs, says too many assumptions were being made which ""exaggerate the scale"" of the obesity problem and there's  not enough evidence to suggest that after that cut-off point, children are actually ""obese"". Paediatrician Dr Max Davie says: ""No-one thinks it's the best or a perfect measure but it does correlate with the negative health outcomes associated with obesity."" Children with BMIs in the region of 90% and upwards are at higher risk of harm and, on average, the higher you go up the scale, the higher the risk of ill-health. Dr Davie says although both the 95% and 98% cut-off points for obesity are somewhat arbitrary, they still serve as a useful tool. It might not be the perfect measure of when an individual child is at risk of ill-health, but it does give a way of comparing populations over time and around the country, he says. It's also a simple enough measure that it can be applied to the whole population. In the NHS in England, doctors tend to use a slightly higher threshold than the Public Health England one - they say a child is obese if they are in the 98th percentile of weights. But Public Health England says it uses a lower threshold in order to capture children who are at risk of becoming under or overweight or obese, as well as those who already fall into this category. These are averages though - children develop at different rates, some may gain weight before a growth spurt in height, and there are ethnic differences too.

"The proposals are part of the government's Childhood Obesity Plan The government is planning new rules to tackle childhood obesity by targeting supermarkets, junk food adverts and restaurant menus. The tighter restrictions have been broadly welcomed - although many people say they raise a number of issues. Under the new proposals, the sale of sweets and fatty snacks will be banned at checkouts, shop entrances and in buy-one-get-one-free deals. Sarah Galvin, from Southampton, welcomed the news and said the ""daily battle"" with children at shop checkouts will be ""much easier"" without unhealthy snacks. The plan proposes bans on sweets and junk food promotions in the aisles and online Karrie Langdon, who lives in a village and is eight miles from the nearest supermarket, said her local shop used to be ""well stocked with healthy foods and fresh vegetables"" before being taken over by a chain. ""I walked into the store and was confronted with a wall of sweets and sugary drinks,"" she said. ""The fresh veg and fruit has been reduced to a small area tucked away. ""If consumers are faced with only being able to purchase from this type of shop, what choice do people have to eat healthier? ""Unless there is a change of policy within the retail area then promoting healthier choices will not work."" Checkout sweets targeted in obesity fight What to do if your child is overweight Is UK one of the worst child obesity nations? Tesco to move sweets from checkouts British mother-of-two Belinda Griffith spent 16 years living overseas in Singapore and the Netherlands and said she was struck by the difference in people's shopping habits in the UK and abroad. ""They sell food in the UK in much larger packages which means you have to buy a greater quantity than you actually need,"" she said. ""There's also the reliance on ready-prepared foods where the portion size is also predetermined."" Supermarkets Co-op, Aldi andTesco,externalsaid they do not stock sweets at checkouts while Sainsbury's and Aldi said they do not run multi-buy promotions. The Co-op also said it uses traffic light labelling and will be ""looking at the plans in more detail to respond to the consultation"". Clare Shaw said the proposed rules were good measures"" but suggested the government should use the money generated by the sugar tax to subsidise fruit. ""[Fruit] is always expensive to buy and is much better for the children,"" she said. ""Why is it cheaper to buy a multipack of Mars bars than it is to buy a punnet of grapes or strawberries?"" Food campaigner Jack Monroe, who is known for her blog about cooking for a family on a shoestring,tweeted:,external""This may be kind of radical but why don't they just make healthy food cheaper?"" The government is also considering the introduction of new rules on advertising unhealthy food to children on TV and online - which could include a pre-9pm ban. Ms Galvin said a ban on ads for unhealthy food was ""well overdue"", adding: ""It baffles me that companies are allowed to advertise sweets, McDonald's on children's TV, or any TV pre-watershed. ""Kids don't need this advertised to them and it makes our job as parents harder."" TheChildren's Food Campaign welcomed the new ad policy,externalbut said they want to see restrictions on cartoon characters on junk food packaging and junk food sponsorship in sports. Peter Whitaker from Malton in Yorkshire agreed: ""Simple, change their diet, less chips more greens, and get them out for more exercise."" Restaurants, cafes and takeaways are also being targeted under the proposed measures, which will require them to provide clear calorie labelling. Michael Birt, who runs an independent pub in rural Leicestershire, said the new mandatory calorie information on menus ""will lead to a lot more of our type of business failing, lead to a lot more mass-produced food on menus and less choice for the consumer"". He said: ""How are we supposed to work out what calories are in a dish to put in a menu, or are we expected to pay an outside nutritionist to work this out for us?"" ""Nowadays eating out is becoming a luxury and it is more of a struggle for businesses like mine to survive without additional regulation set by the government."" However, Heath Secretary Jeremy Hunt told the BBC on Sunday that there could be possible exemptions for smaller businesses. But all big restaurant chains would have to provide calorie labelling. The health secretary suggested independent eateries could be exempt There was a mixed reaction on Twitter, with some diners welcoming the requirement for nutritional information. But one said it is ""going to take the joy away from eating out"" while another said: ""It will not be pretty"". Someone else added: ""I can't tell you how much I utterly disagree with putting calorie information on restaurant menus. ""As someone who suffers from an eating disorder that is one of the worst things you could do."" Nicola Earl said that focusing on the price of sugary drinks or sweets ""isn't going to make any difference"", adding: ""A smoker continues to smoke whatever the price and a drinker finds cheaper brands"". She said: ""I strongly believe obesity is a mental health issue. We need to look at why a child is being overfed. ""Whether someone is going to have issues around food will often be determined by events in childhood or their parent's own issues with food. ""Many people eat compulsively for many different reasons and repeat the same pattern with their children, just as children see parents use unhealthy strategies to control their weight."" Many 'unaware' of eating disorders signs 'Anorexia's a mental disorder, not a body size' Study casts doubt on 'healthy obesity' What does it mean if a child is 'severely obese'? Liz said her 11-year-old son is overweight and, despite being aware of healthy eating, is ""tempted to eat the wrong food as comfort food"". She said he has tried their local council's exercise programme - which includes the gym, swimming classes and football - but ""they are expensive and he's not a team player"". She said: ""He's been slowly put off exercise by the school and his friends. ""I think he's made to feel that he's no good at team sports. I also find sports teachers aren't sensitive to reluctant children, my son is conscious of his weight and slowness."" ""Sport and other activities need to be free outside of school. Activities should be introduced where parents and children can take part together."" Duane Edwards, from Tidworth, Wiltshire, said society has ""failed the children of today by being over-protective, not letting them go out and play"". ""I compare it to our childhoods back in the 80s and 90s,"" he said. ""Children back then were never in the house, we would be out climbing trees, placing up rope swings, swimming in rivers, playing in the countryside and playing all sports imaginable without our parents there to keep an eye on us.""

"Parents should not expect schools to police children's eating and exercise, or toilet train pupils, Ofsted boss Amanda Spielman will say this week. England's chief inspector for schools will argue the answer to the obesity crisis lies in the home, and parents should not ""abdicate responsibility"". Neither can schools be a ""panacea"" for knife crime or child neglect, she will add in her second annual report. Two studies have this year queried the benefit of school anti-obesity schemes. In February, the British Medical Journal reported that a year-long anti-obesity programme involving more than 600 West Midlands primary school pupilsyielded no improvements. And in July an Ofsted study of 60 schools found no link between efforts to tackle obesity and pupils' weight. What does it mean if a child is 'severely obese'? Schools alone cannot fix childhood obesity - Ofsted boss Childhood obesity: combating 'pester power' Ms Spielman, who will present Ofsted's annual report on Tuesday, will highlight concerns that - by the time they start primary school - almost a quarter of children in England are overweight or obese. This rises to over a third by the time they move on to secondary school. ""Schools can and should teach children about the importance of healthy eating and exercise in line with their core purpose; their PE lessons should get them out of breath,"" she will say. ""But beyond that, schools cannot take over the role of health professionals - and above all parents."" Highlighting the growing evidence of children arriving at reception unable to use a toilet, she will add: ""This is difficult for teachers, disruptive for other children and has a terrible social impact on the children affected."" Ms Spielman will also argue that by expecting schools to tackle gang-related crime or child neglect, society risks not only distracting them from their core purpose but also failing to solve the problems. Such complex matters need to be dealt with by those with the correct knowledge and expertise, she will argue. ""While schools can play a role in educating young people about the danger of knives, they cannot be a panacea for this particular societal ill,"" she will say. ""Instead, preventing knife crime requires all local safeguarding partners to work together to protect children from harm whilst the relevant agencies tackle criminal activity.""

"This video can not be played Michael Gove: ""I'm supporting the prime minister"" If MPs don't back Theresa May's Brexit deal there could be another EU referendum, Michael Gove has said. The leading cabinet Brexiteer said Mrs May's deal was not perfect - but if MPs did not vote it through on 11 December there was a risk of ""no Brexit at all"". He told the BBC's Andrew Marr show there may now be a Commons majority for another referendum. Labour has said it will attempt to topple Mrs May and force a general election if MPs reject her deal. If that fails, they will then seek support in the Commons for another referendum. Michael Gove insisted Mrs May could still win the vote on 11 December despite dozens of her own MPs being against her EU deal. Corbyn will do BBC debate if head-to-head Another referendum 'may be PM's only option' Brexit: A really simple guide SNP will support bid to put Brexit on hold The environment secretary told the BBC that winning the Commons vote would be ""challenging"". But although Mrs May's deal was not perfect, ""we have got to recognise that if we don't vote for this, the alternatives are no deal or no Brexit"". ""There is a real risk if we don't vote for this deal there may be a majority in the House of Commons for a second referendum,"" said Mr Gove, a leading figure in the 2016 Leave campaign. Asked if Mrs May would have to stand down as PM if she lost the vote on her deal in nine days' time, he said: ""Absolutely not."" He claimed there was a ""strong movement behind the prime minister"" among the public. Labour has said it will table a no confidence motion in the government if MPs vote down the deal in a bid to topple Mrs May and force a general election. Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said: ""If the prime minister has lost a vote of that significance then there has to be a question of confidence in the government. ""I think it's inevitable that we would seek to move that,"" he added. Under the Fixed Term Parliament Act, if the government loses a vote on a motion of no confidence it has 14 days to pass a second confidence motion, or Parliament is dissolved and a general election is called. If Labour fails to force a general election it will seek support in the Commons for another EU referendum. Mr Gyimah said he would be voting against Mrs May's Brexit deal Conservative support for a further referendum is growing -science minister Sam Gyimahquit the government on Saturday to join the People's Vote campaign. A cross-party group of 17 MPs,in a letter published in the Observer,,externalhas also called for Parliament to support another referendum at the earliest opportunity. But a referendum can only be held if the government legislates for one and a majority of MPs vote for it. The People's Vote campaign, which is backed by about 30 Labour MPs, a smaller number of Conservatives, the Lib Dems, the SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Greens, argue that the public must be given the final say on the terms of Britain's exit, now that they know what the deal is. Following Michael Gove's comments on the Marr show, Lib Dem Brexit spokesman Tom Brake said: ""The government has made a Horlicks out of Brexit and now one of its chief architects has admitted that the final say might go back to the people."" He said the Lib Dems and ""many others"" will ""demand a People's Vote with an option to remain in the EU"". Labour's shadow international development secretary Barry Gardiner told Andrew Marr he thought ""remain and no-deal"" would have to be ""on the table"" in any referendum. But Sir Keir Starmer told Sky News he would be ""worried"" about no-deal being on the ballot paper, as it would be ""catastrophic"" for the country. Michael Gove claimed the Leave campaign would probably win a fresh referendum by an even larger margin but holding one would ""damage faith in democracy and rip apart the social fabric"" of the country. Many Leave voters would see it is a ""condescending"" move by the political establishment, who would effectively be saying people were ""too thick to make a decision"" the first time around, he told Andrew Marr. This video can not be played Asked about the legacy she'd like to leave as PM, Mrs May says there's ""a lot more for me still to do"". By Laura Kuenssberg, BBC political editor Support for the prime minister's Brexit compromise seems to be shrinking, rather than growing. If Theresa May acknowledges it in private, she certainly won't touch that notion in public. Read more from Laura here The government claims the chances of Britain leaving the EU on 29 March without a deal are more likely if MPs reject Mrs May's deal. Mr Gove said there would not be another Commons vote on the deal if MPs voted it down on 11 December - something Mrs May has previously refused to rule out.

"Stunning draw in Los Angeles Fury on top before final-round knockdown Wilder retains his WBC world heavyweight title Judges call it 115-111 for Wilder, 114-112 for Fury and 113-113 Get involved: Tweet #bbcboxing or text 81111 (UK only) British heavyweight Joe Joyce claims first-round stoppage over American Joe Hanks Michael Emons And that is the end of this live page. What a great fight. Tyson Fury is floored twice, including in the last round when he managed to haul himself up off the canvas at the count of nine. However, he had been the better boxer throughout the majority of the fight, but it still ends in a controversial draw as Deontay Wilder retains his WBC world heavyweight title. Thanks for joining us and for all your comments. Until next time, bye for now. Luke ReddyBBC Sport in Los Angeles Hard to put into words
just how gripping that was. You could almost feel the crowd getting sucked into
the ring. I will forever wonder
how Tyson Fury got up. He's told media he was touched by a ""holy
hand"". From where I was sitting, it certainly looked like he was finished. And on the scoring what
can you say. The 115-111 card looks particularly odd. Many on social media are
screaming an injustice. Speaking to media at the venue some agree. There are those though -
and I am one of them - who can see why it would at least be close. Wilder scored two
knockdowns, giving him 10-8 rounds. There were also a couple of rounds in which
little happened and when that's the case, you're always at risk of a judge
thinking your opponent nicked it. There's no doubt Fury
bettered long spells and let's be clear, if he avoids that last knock down he
wins and no one would be saying a word. Boxing has fine margins. BBC Radio 5 live WBC president Mauricio Sulaiman to BBC Radio 5 live Sportsweek:""I think the draw is well taken. It could have gone either way. It was a great fight. The two knock-downs were the defining factor of the fight. ""Several rounds were very close - a few punches makes the difference. "" And here is the moment Luke was talking about. We definitely need more songs in news conferences. So, Jose, another bad result. But, anyway, what will you be singing for us? This video can not be played Luke ReddyBBC Sport in Los Angeles America - and
particularly Los Angeles - loves a showman. Tyson Fury's sing song
in his news conference added a certain romance to a night of destructive
drama. You have to wonder what
America will think of him now? He spoke well at his
news conference, refused to berate judging and, of course, broke out a tune. That will be beamed into
homes on news channels on Sunday. Throw in the weight loss and countless other
narratives and his stock is surely set to soar. All the reaction and analysis
after Tyson Fury and Deontay Wilderâs draw, from the men involved, Frank
Warren, Rickie Hatton, Freddie Roach, and Mike, Steve and Andyâs final analysis
after one of the most thrilling fights in recent memory. Download the BBC Radio 5 live podcast here. Former two-weight world champion Ricky Hatton, also working in Fury's corner, spoke to BBC's Mike Costello. Hatton said: ""It's very hard not to be biased when your friend's up there. But I just don't see, other than the two knockdowns where he'd gained four points, how the judges gave Wilder any other round. ""It would have been one of the greatest comebacks in boxing history, and it was a shame that one punch in the last round cost him. When he got up after second knockdown, I was more worried about his well-being. He came back from that even stronger, he's a freak of nature. ""That's why he's the lineal champion, that's why he's undefeated. That's why he can go through all the problems he had, and come to the backyard of a champion with a record like Wilder has and put a performance like that. ""He's a very inspirational character, he came into my gym around two years ago when he was 24 stone. To put in that performance from where he has come from is inspirational. You won't get any better mental health ambassador after what he's done."" Wilder v Fury ends in a draw Freddie Roach, who was working as the cut man in Tyson Fury's corner, spoke to BBC boxing correspondent Mike Costello on 5 live. Roach said: ""He (Fury) did well, he boxed well. He outpointed the opponent I thought easily. ""A lot of people thought the fight would be stopped at the knockdowns but he showed a lot of heart to get up. When he got knocked down the first time, I thought he actually came back and won that round. ""They have a rematch clause and it will be a great rematch. I look forward to working with him again if possible."" Wilder v Fury ends in a draw Filipino boxing legend Manny Pacquiao on Twitter... Allow Twitter content?

"The National Audit Office (NAO) probe is planned for early 2019 The delay to Crossrail's opening and the project's ballooning costs will be investigated by the spending watchdog. Transport officials said in August that the new rail line, which isalmost Â£600m over budget, wouldopen nine months after its scheduled launch. A National Audit Office (NAO) probe is now planned for early 2019. The project's joint sponsors, Transport for London (TfL) and the Department for Transport (DfT), said they would assist the NAO's investigation. The NAO will examine the ""causes of the cost increases and schedule delays, the terms of the additional funding, and the governance and oversight of the programme"", according toa statement on its website,external. Europe's biggest infrastructure project aims to help ease London's congestion by connecting sites such as Heathrow Airport and the Canary Wharf business district. The route, to be known as the Elizabeth Line, was due to open in December, but will now be launched in autumn 2019 to allow more time for testing. The DfT and TfL have also commissioned independent reviews into Crossrail Ltd's governance and financing The government announced in July that Crossrail's overall funding had increased to Â£15.4bn, and the DfT later agreed to make Â£350m of short-term finance available. The NAO added: ""We will also examine the steps being taken by Crossrail Ltd, TfL, and the department to minimise the impact of the cost increases and delays."" A DfT spokesperson said: ""We welcome the NAO investigation and stand ready to assist."" The DfT and TfL have also commissioned independent reviews into Crossrail Ltd's governance and financing. which are being carried out by auditors KPMG. Transport bosses said in September that TfL wouldmiss out on Â£20m of new revenuedue to the delay, but the total cost of the delay could be far higher.

"Crossrail will be called the Elizabeth Line when it opens at the end of 2018 London's Crossrail project is running almost Â£600m over budget with extra funding required to complete the work, the rail minister has announced. Jo Johnson revealed the scheme's budget had increased from Â£14.8bn to Â£15.4bn in hisannual update about the project.,external Mr Johnson said ""cost pressures"" had risen but additional finance will be provided by the Department for Transport (DfT) and Transport for London (TfL). Crossrail is due to open in December. A spokesperson for the project said that while the cost increases were ""disappointing"" the extra funding ""is critical to the delivery of this vital project"". Crossrail's original budget was set at Â£15.9bn in 2007 but cut to Â£14.8bn in 2010 The DfT and TfL are each providing Â£150m of additional funding to complete construction of the scheme. An extra Â£290m will also be paid by the DfT and Network Rail to upgrade the existing rail network linked to the project. In his statement, Mr Johnson said the project was 93% complete and was entering ""the critical testing and commissioning stage"". He said in spite of the extra funding, more than 60% of the project had been provided by Londoners and London businesses. TfL said the the railway had ""involved some of the most complex engineering ever undertaken in Europe"" and ""a number of factors"" made the additional funding necessary. A spokesperson for the DfT said Crossrail would add ""up to Â£42bn to the UK economy"" and the final budget was still ""significantly below the original funding package of Â£15.9bn."" Jo Johnson said the project was 93% complete However, think tank IPPR North said the announcement about the increased funding will be ""poorly received by people in the north... who are yet to see the investment that we need."" Liverpool City Region mayor Steve Rotheram claimed the increase in Crossrail's budget could fund ""a significant amount of a new west to east rail line to Manchester."" Groups in the north have previously spoken of their ""widespread anger"" following the government'sbacking of Crossrail 2.

"Mr Trump (front right) met Mr Xi (front left) after the G20 summit in Buenos Aires US President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping have agreed to halt new trade tariffs for 90 days to allow for talks, the US says. At a post-G20 summit meeting in Buenos Aires, Mr Trump agreed not to boost tariffs on $200bn (Â£157bn) of Chinese goods from 10% to 25% on 1 January. China will buy a ""very substantial"" amount of agricultural, industrial and energy products, the US says. Meanwhile, Beijing says the two sides agreed to open up their markets. The Trump and Xi deal: A temporary truce It was the first face-to-face meeting between the two leaders since a trade war erupted earlier this year. The dispute broke out after Mr Trump complained China was doing nothing to cut its large surplus in bilateral trade. At the summit in Argentina's capital earlier on Saturday, the G20 leaders agreeda joint declaration that notes divisions over trade,externalbut does not criticise protectionism. Mr Trump and Mr Xi held a ""highly successful meeting"",the White House says in a statement.,external It says the US tariffs on Chinese goods will remain unchanged for 90 days, but warns: ""If at the end of this period of time, the parties are unable to reach an agreement, the 10 percent tariffs will be raised to 25 percent."" The US is the biggest export market for Chinese goods The US says China agreed to ""purchase a not yet agreed upon, but very substantial, amount of agricultural, energy, industrial, and other products from the United States to reduce the trade imbalance between our two countries"". Both sides also pledged to ""immediately begin negotiations on structural changes with respect to forced technology transfer, intellectual property protection, non-tariff barriers, cyber intrusions and cyber theft"", the White House says. President Trump said earlier this year he wanted to stop the ""unfair transfers of American technology and intellectual property to China"". According to the US, China has also signalled it will allow a tie-up between two major semiconductor manufacturers which Chinese regulators have been blocking. The White House statement said China was ""open to approving the previously unapproved Qualcomm-NXP deal"". Qualcomm - the world's biggest chipmaker - had abandoned its $44bn bid for Dutch rival NXPSemiconductors after Chinese opposition. The US also says Beijing agreed to designate Fentanyl as a controlled substance. The opioid - much of it thought to be made in China - is driving a huge rise in drug addiction in the US. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told reporters after the talks that ""the principal agreement has effectively prevented further expansion of economic friction between the two countries"". He hailed ""new space for win-win co-operation"", while Chinese state TV said negotiations would continue. US-China trade war in 300 words Both sides have imposed tariffs on billions of dollars' worth of goods. The US has hit $250bn of Chinese goods with tariffs since July, and China has retaliated by imposing duties on $110bn of US products. Mr Trump had also said that if talks in Argentina were unsuccessful, he would carry out a threat to hit the remaining $267bn of annual Chinese exports to the US with tariffs of between 10 and 25%. US-China trade divisions meantan Asian economic summit earlier this month was unable to agree a formal leaders' statementfor the first time in its history. Returning from the G20 summit on Air Force One, Mr Trump told reporters ""it's an incredible deal"" that would have an ""incredibly positive impact on farming"". ""What I'd be doing is holding back on tariffs. China will be opening up. China will be getting rid of tariffs,"" Mr Trump said. Stephen McDonell, BBC China correspondent in Beijing China has pretty much given up nothing in this deal because the future tariffs threatened from the Beijing side were retaliatory in nature and only to be applied if the United State escalated. For this it has gained a 90-day reprieve, during which time both sides have pledged to ramp up talks. When China's Foreign Minster Wang Yi spoke to reporters after the meeting he said the two leaders had agreed to open up each other's markets and that this process could lead to the resolution of ""legitimate"" US concerns. This was either an acknowledgment that Washington does have legitimate concerns or a way of differentiating those American concerns which are reasonable from those which are not actually ""legitimate"". This is not a suspension of the trade war but a suspension of the escalation of the trade war. Big questions remain about the preparedness of Beijing to allow international access to this enormous market to a level that would satisfy the Trump administration prompting a complete halt in the trade war. On other issues, the US president announced he would be ""formally terminating Nafta [the North American Free Trade Agreement] shortly"". Mr Trump (C) earlier signed a new trade agreement on Friday with his Mexican and Canadian counterparts This would give lawmakers six months, he said, to approve a new trade deal agreed with his Mexican and Canadian counterparts on Friday or revert to trade rules from before 1994, when Nafta took effect. Trump expects second Kim summit soon Trump claims progress after Kim summit He also said he was likely to meet North Korean Leader Kim Jong-un in January or February and three locations for their second meeting were being considered. Mr Trump added that he would also invite Mr Kim, with whom he has ""a good relationship"", to the US at some point. French leader Emmanuel Macron told reporters that the World Trade Organization, the body that regulates trade disputes, needed to be modernised. A senior US official told Reuters that it was the first time that the G20 had recognised that the WTO was ""currently falling short of meeting its objectives"" and needed reform. China v the US: Not just a trade war Erdogan demands Khashoggi extraditions On Friday Mr Trump briefly met Russian President Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of the G20, a Russian official told Reuters. Earlier the US president said he had postponed a planned press conference ""out of respect for the Bush family"", following the death of former President George HW Bush, at the age of 94.
