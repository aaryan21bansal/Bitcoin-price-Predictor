"  By  Sean Coughlan At the scene of the terror attack at London Bridge, several memorial shrines have appeared, with people leaving flowers, cards and candles in memory of the two young victims, Jack Merritt and Saskia Jones. People want to find a way of understanding the loss of much-loved young people who should have had fine lives stretching out ahead of them. There are cans of Guinness left among the flowers, drinks for two twenty-somethings who never got to have the weekend that followed that Friday afternoon. There are posters promising “Love will win, hate will lose” and tributes to Jack and Saskia in poetry, pictures and shaky handwriting. People with flowers are asking each other what messages they should leave and the practical everyday things, like should they take off the price tag? Below a printed photo of Jack is a closed pink envelope – addressed only to “J”. It’s a card he will never open, sent from someone he might not even have known. What is inside the sealed card, like what is inside the heart of a human who says he has changed, is not possible to see. So what happened on the afternoon of 29 November, on a bridge already synonymous with a barbaric attack on people going about their everyday lives? There is still much to be explained - such as was it right that Usman Khan, convicted of terrorism offences,  was allowed to be in London? The first striking detail is the sheer speed at which events unfolded. It was only 300 seconds between the police receiving the first report of a stabbing at Fishmongers’ Hall, at 13:58 GMT, and the attacker being shot by armed officers who confronted him at 14:03. If you pace the distance between the hall and the site of where Khan’s life ended it’s only a matter of seconds. But in that compressed time frame, so many different lives had intersected. The good, the bad and those who, it turns out, might be both at the same time. Khan had arrived at Fishmongers’ Hall as the model of a reformed prisoner, trusted to travel and invited to an event celebrating the work of giving offenders a second chance. But for reasons that are still unclear, all that was betrayed. Khan had fatally wounded two people, and injured others, before being chased out on to the street. Under the gaze of mobile phone cameras, he was cornered, fearlessly brought down and disarmed by people who ran towards danger, rather than away from it. Khan had been unpicked from the maul of bodies and shot by armed officers who had intervened with remarkable speed. He had been wearing a suicide belt that was later found to be fake. But it was too late for his victims who had helped to organise the prison rehabilitation conference taking place at Fishmongers’ Hall. Jack Merritt, 25, and Saskia Jones, 23, were Cambridge graduates, a co-ordinator and a volunteer for the Learning Together scheme, which runs prison education projects, and which was marking its fifth anniversary. They had high ideals, their work described by another student who took part as being about “seeing the best in people”. Jack’s father Dave Merritt wrote about his son’s commitment: “Unlike many of us, Jack did not just go to work. He lived and breathed fire in his pursuit of a better world for all humanity, particularly those most in need.” The work, helping prisoners to turn around their lives, was fuelled by Jack’s belief in the “inherent goodness of humanity”, said his father. There were many tributes to how Saskia, who was from Stratford-upon-Avon, also wanted to put her values into action. Colleen Moore, deputy head of criminology and policing at Anglia Ruskin University where Saskia had taken her first degree, said her former student was “fearless, she was a warrior, she was going to change the world – maybe she will”. “She was always thinking about what she could do with her learning to make a difference in the world, to make it a better place.” Olivia Smith, a lecturer in criminology who marked Saskia’s dissertation when she was at Anglia Ruskin, described her as ""one of a kind"" who ""would have been a force for good"". Dr Smith said: ""I'm so sorry that the world won't get to see what she could have achieved. ""Saskia's dissertation was so good that I cried with pride when I marked it."" Prof Loraine Gelsthorpe, director of Cambridge University’s Institute of Criminology, which organised the Learning Together scheme, praised Saskia’s “warm disposition and extraordinary intellectual creativity”. She remembered Jack, who was from Cottenham in Cambridgeshire, as an advocate for the “politics of love”. “He worked tirelessly in dark places to pull towards the light.” But Saskia’s and Jack’s young lives collided with the brutal and unpredictable trajectory of Khan, a 28-year-old who had spent most of his adult life in jail for terrorist offences. Born in Stoke-on-Trent, he was arrested in 2010 after a surveillance operation against a group that appeared to be plotting terror attacks and wanting to raise funds for a training camp in Pakistan. There were links with a spider’s web of different conspiring extremist groups and sometimes sketchy and amateurish plans, including bombing the London Stock Exchange, not that far from where Khan ultimately carried out his attack. He had been convicted in 2012 and released from prison, under licence, on Christmas Eve 2018. He had given an impression of wanting to change. While in prison he had taken part in rehabilitation classes and argued that he had become more mature and wanted to start a life as a better citizen, asking to take part in a de-radicalisation programme. He had praised the Learning Together project for “opening minds” – and wrote a poem for it saying: “I write so I can enter the coldest of hearts.” He featured in one of its newsletters - as an example of someone who could learn a different way of thinking. It was a celebration of Learning Together’s work that brought Khan together with Jack Merritt, Saskia Jones, and other guests at Fishmongers’ Hall, a grand neo-classical 19th Century building on the north side of London Bridge. The participants – including offenders, prison reformers, academics, prison staff and charity workers – are seen in photos sitting in some of the elegant reception rooms. In the drawing room delegates gathered beneath ornate chandeliers, with long curtains on deep windows and below a 1950s painting of a youthful Queen Elizabeth II. Fishmongers' Hall, entrance hall Fishmongers' Hall, entrance hall The hall is the home of the Worshipful Company of Fishmongers, a medieval livery company in the City of London, with long links to the Thames - and holding many curiosities and collections related to the sea. Whoever brought back a narwhal’s tusk could never have anticipated how it was going to be deployed. Wearing an electronic tag and with his movements controlled as a condition of his release, Khan had been allowed to come to London, travelling from his most recent address in Stafford. The agenda was headlined as “a day to celebrate, connect and collaborate”, beginning at 11:00, with a “brunch and chat”. Talks, workshops and creative writing sessions, and a panel discussion on the “power of education for social justice” were planned. But a few minutes before 14:00, Khan appeared in the hall with two knives. The chief executive of the Fishmongers’ Company, Cdre Toby Williamson, said staff who had been present, described a scene in which “there’s blood, there’s screaming, there’s chaos”. A Polish kitchen worker, Lukasz, grabbed a “long stick” and “charges towards the bad guy and impacts him on the chest”, said Cdre Williamson, a former head of operational training for the Royal Navy. Police assist  Lukasz after attack Police assist  Lukasz after attack For about a minute, he says, Lukasz was involved in “combat” with the attacker, “buying time” and allowing “others to escape - to move to adjacent rooms”. Two others arrived to help Lukasz, picking up the unlikely weapons that were available in such a grand setting - a fire extinguisher and the tusk of a narwhal. But the mix of courage and curios was enough to chase Khan down the staircase, where he looked for ways to get out of the building. Toby Williamson:  'There was blood, screaming and chaos' At some point in the chaos, Jack and Saskia had been attacked and three others had been wounded. The inquest, which opened at the Old Bailey this week, heard that the two young people who died had each received a “stab wound to the chest”. When the doors in the entrance hall eventually opened, the attacker fell into the street. The chaos inside the hall suddenly spilled into the open, into the cold winter sunlight on London Bridge, into the crowds of office workers and crawling Friday afternoon traffic. Passers-by and bus passengers turned their heads and then switched on their cameras, unsure of what they were seeing. On the other side of the road was a BBC journalist, John McManus. “Like everybody else, I was in my own world inside my head, checking a location on a map on my phone, while dodging tourists who were taking snaps of each other with Tower Bridge as the backdrop,” said McManus. He then became aware of a sudden “commotion”. “It was hard to tell exactly what was going on, but there was clearly some kind of fight. I heard someone shout something indistinct. As the traffic moved – or perhaps it stopped at that point, I’m not sure – I could see a number of men pile on to somebody else. It was like a rugby scrum.” McManus saw a passer-by leap across the crash barrier in the road and join in the struggle. “Then I suddenly caught sight of a policeman – standing in the middle of four lanes of traffic – with a gun raised, pointing in the direction of somebody on the other side of the bridge. He seemed to have appeared from nowhere. “Other officers were there and started screaming to clear the bridge. I filmed some footage on my phone and then started to move away. At that point I heard two shots ring out. I moved back and could clearly see somebody lying motionless on the pavement.” McManus was the first to break the news of what was happening – and at the same time images were spreading rapidly on social media, before any official confirmation. On the bridge there was confusion – and questions about whether other shots were fired. Another eyewitness, who doesn’t want to be identified and who hasn’t previously spoken to the media, was one of the bus passengers close to the scene. He told the BBC of the fear and sense of danger among people as they got off the bus and saw Khan’s body, and how they did not know whether the attack was still continuing or if there were other assailants. Even with the benefit of hindsight there still seems to be uncertainty about what exactly happened on the bridge - and relief that there were no other victims. The eyewitness believes that a bus or possibly more than one bus was hit by gunfire during this confusion and after the attacker had been fatally shot – from a direction which seems to be unclear. He took a picture showing a round hole in the shattered back window of a London bus on the bridge - with Transport for London confirming the damage. Smashed bus window Smashed bus window This could have been a ricochet from a police bullet, the Metropolitan Police suggested, but said there needed to be further investigations. A bullet hitting the back of a bus which was facing towards the site of the shooting of Khan, would raise other questions about the location from which the shots were fired. McManus is also certain there were shots other than those initially fired when the police reached Khan. But in those 300 seconds between the police being called and confronting Khan there had been another unexpected, improbable and extraordinary intersection of lives. A group of people had spontaneously come together to stop Khan from killing anyone else. “The guys that were there were absolutely amazing, incredible people, heroes beyond belief,” said Stevie Hurst, a tour guide who himself had run over to help. “We were trying to do as much as we could to try and dislodge the knife from his hand so he wouldn’t harm anyone else.” Hurst says Khan was shouting “get off me” and that the shots were fired at the point when Khan rolled over and appeared to be wearing an explosive device. Thomas Gray:   'I stamped on his wrist as hard as I could' His colleague Thomas Gray said he saw the attacker with knives that seemed to be taped to his hands and tried to stamp on his wrist. “I grew up on rugby and the mentality of rugby, on or off the pitch, is ‘one in, all in’.” There was also a plain-clothes officer from the British Transport Police, who appears to have taken a knife away from the scrum, and Lukasz from Fishmongers’ Hall was nearby. People quickly began calling them heroes. But then it became clear that those taking part included offenders who had been at the prison rehabilitation conference. It started a debate about whether bad people could do good things. There seemed to be more moral contradictions here than in a Graham Greene novel. Could someone who had committed terrible crimes really change? The starkest example was James Ford, described as a hero before it emerged that he was on day release from a life sentence for murdering a 21-year-old woman, Amanda Champion, who had the mental age of a 15-year-old. The family of Ford’s victim reacted angrily to the suggestion that he should ever be considered heroic and rejected the idea that he could have changed. Amanda’s aunt, Angela Cox, told the Daily Mail: “For him to be called a hero - he is not, he is a cold-blooded murderer. “For no reason whatsoever, he just went out and murdered a disabled person. I don’t care what he’s done today, he’s a murderer...  People don’t change,” she told the paper. The public ambiguity about this could be seen in Google searches, which showed people looking for the “London Bridge hero murderer”. Could a person be both? Sir Martin Narey, a former director general of the prison service and chief executive of the National Offender Management Service, told the BBC that he thought “some of the offenders at London Bridge were indisputably heroes”. “In my experience very, very few offenders are all bad and almost all have redeeming features. I worked closely with many such individuals early in my career when I was in charge of a wing at what was then the UK's most secure prison. “All too often the monster you're expecting to receive after reading details about their offence is no such thing. It doesn't mean they must not be held securely or that they're not dangerous. But I knew very few who ever deserved the monster tag.” But Sir Martin, from his years working in prisons, is sceptical about the effectiveness of many rehabilitation courses, particularly short ones. He says it’s unlikely that an offender who has undergone a lifetime of neglect and negative behaviour is going to be transformed by an education project, no matter how well intentioned. Instead, he argues that prisons should be made decent and safe places – creating an environment in which prisoners themselves might decide they want to change. Can anyone ever really know whether someone who has undergone rehabilitation or de-radicalisation training has sincerely changed? How do you know what they’re really thinking deep inside? “It’s very difficult to be certain,” says Sir Martin. “Some smart prisoners will, over time, learn the right responses. Sometimes one can see past that, particularly when responses are rather glib. But it’s impossible to be sure and that’s why the system is cautious.” But the effectiveness of rehabilitation is defended by Prof David Wilson, who worked in prisons and is now a criminologist at Birmingham City University and a supporter of the rehabilitation work at HMP Grendon in Buckinghamshire. He says it is no coincidence that three of the offenders or ex-offenders involved in tackling Khan had been at Grendon. James Ford, former prisoners John Crilly – who confronted the attacker with a fire extinguisher – and Marc Conway, had all been through Grendon’s therapeutic approach which is “about getting prisoners to change their behaviour,” even if they have been “damaged and dangerous”. “This can genuinely turn people’s lives around,” says Prof Wilson. “I have seen people change,” he says. There is a “wealth of evidence” to show it works in reducing the risk of future harm and is not “just middle-class benevolence”, but it takes at least two years, says Prof Wilson. The man who killed Jack and Saskia had been through rehabilitation at other prisons - and Prof Wilson says it raises questions about the quality of some training, which can be “off the shelf, tick box courses”. As the BBC’s home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw revealed this week, two counter-terrorism courses taken by the attacker had not yet been tested to prove that they were effective. There are likely to be more questions about the appropriateness of his release and scrutiny of his activities in the past year and what checks were carried out, by all parties concerned, before he was allowed to take part in the event. And what happened between his arrival in the morning and his later appearance, dressed and armed for terror? Counter-extremism experts have raised the question as to whether the prevention and detection of  so-called “lone actor” Islamist terrorists needs to be approached in a different way - looking for types of personality rather than a form of belief. Research has shown that many recent “self-starter” terrorists, who carry out low-tech acts of extreme violence, have a history of addictions and obsessions and a background of petty crime and resentful social isolation. Is this about stopping extreme beliefs? Or about tackling social and psychological problems wearing the costume of an ideology? There will be questions too about what’s next for the Learning Together project. The organisers will face public scrutiny as well as their own private grief. But terror is not only an attack on individuals, it’s on the living entity of a city. London Bridge is one of the great symbolic centres of the capital. It still carries the physical changes required after the attacks of June 2017, with crash barriers and bollards protecting the bridge. What the attack also showed last week was the city’s apparent capacity to continue, with the waters of city life closing over almost immediately. BBC journalist John McManus says when he turned a corner a woman was drinking coffee outside a cafe, in earshot of the gunfire, but seemingly unbothered. There was little panic even among those on the bridge, he says. “Many people hung around to take social media footage, even as police were ordering them away. “Perhaps this is the new normal in London. Do we now expect terrorist attacks to take place? Is there a part of our brains which, having seen and read so much about similar incidents, has somehow adapted to be able to help us deal with such scenes when they happen?” asks McManus. The eyewitness, shaken from being so close to the shattered bus window, says he still had to rush to collect his child from school – and having stepped away from such a traumatic scene, found himself listening to people talking about buying new shoes. “It’s that way London has of continuing,” he says. Many big subjects will be raised by the London Bridge attack, about crime, punishment and the possibility of redemption. How will the life-affirming work of Jack and Saskia be continued after their deaths? But there will also be unanswerable questions, about the human capacity for great good and evil, and the unadorned awfulness of grief at the loss of such young lives so full of hope.

"Britain's longest-running rail franchise came to an end on Saturday after more than 22 years. Virgin Trains, which began serving the West Coast Main Line in 1997, is being replaced by Avanti West Coast. Almost 500 million journeys have been made with Virgin Trains, which is co-owned by Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Group and Stagecoach. The final service pulled out of London Euston at 21:42 GMT, bound for Wolverhampton. But the historic day was marred by disruption when Virgin's last-ever London to Manchester service terminated early at Stockportdue to a train fault,externaljust before midnight. Earlier, Sir Richard tweeted his thanks to ""all our wonderful people"" and their ""incredible work"". Avanti West Coast, which will begin running the service on Sunday, told customers that tickets booked with Virgin Trains for upcoming journeys are still valid. Allow Twitter content?

The end of the franchise comes after Virgin Group and Stagecoachhad their bid to continue running trains on the line disqualifiedby the Department for Transport (DfT) in April because they did not meet pension rules. The companies are suing the DfT over its decision. At the time,Sir Richard saidhe was ""devastated"" by the disqualification. Virgin Trains, which is 49% owned by Stagecoach, introduced a series of innovations on the railways, including automatic delay compensation payments, a system to allow passengers to stream films and TV programmes on demand from their own devices, and the provision of digital tickets available for all fare types.

Rail expert Mark Smith, founder of Seat61.com, said the operator had, with the help of major infrastructure improvements, ""transformed"" its network by almost tripling passenger numbers and doubling services on some routes such as London to Glasgow. ""I think they've done pretty well,"" he said. ""They do have a certain panache and they communicate that to the staff and to the service. Quirky things like the toilets that talk to you, to onboard service with the food and wine. I'm going to be sorry to see them go."" The service has had a variable record - the proportion of Virgin trains which arrived at their final destination within 10 minutes of the timetable ranged from 33% in the final quarter of 2000 to 91% between July-September 2010. The latest figure, for July-September 2019, was 78%. Virgin Trains managing director Phil Whittingham, who will hold the same position with the new operator, said he was ""concentrating on a smooth handover"" to Avanti, adding: ""It's been a wonderful 22 years transforming services on the west coast and we're proud of everything our people have achieved in that time."" Avanti West Coast is owned by First Trenitalia, a partnership between Aberdeen-based FirstGroup and Italian firm Trenitalia. The operator said it would introduce a range of passenger improvements, including 263 more weekly services by 2022, when 23 new trains will begin service. The existing fleet of Pendolino trains will be refurbished - promising 25,000 new seats, more reliable wi-fi and better catering. Allow Twitter content?

"The Conservatives are pledging to invest Â£550m in grassroots football as part of plans to back a UK and Ireland bid to host the 2030 World Cup if they form the next government. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the investment would ""transform lives with a legacy to match the 2012 Olympics"". It would boost existing plans for amateur football in England. But Labour said the funding would not make up for ""years of brutal cuts"" to sporting facilities. TheFootball Foundation,externalpartnership between government, the Football Association (FA) and the Premier League has existed since 2000. It is promising to improve 20,000 grass pitches in England or build new Astroturf versions.

Our policy guide,external It is unclear where the additional government cash would come from, but private partners are expected to fund the remainder of the investment, which would now amount to Â£2bn in total. The FA has said that only one-in-three English community pitches are of adequate quality, with one-in-six amateur matches called off due to poor pitch conditions. The Conservatives said every funding bid would be assessed against several factors, including whether it provides equal playing opportunities for females. The party's manifesto also includes a policy of ensuring all major new sports facilities cater for a range of different activities. Labour had previously voiced its support for a 2030 World Cup bid. Shadow culture secretary, Tom Watson, said: ""This Tory pledge won't undo the years of damage done to grassroots sports facilities by a decade of austerity. ""A last-minute election pledge can't make up for years of brutal cuts."" Meanwhile, the Lib Dems have announced a policy of re-introducing safe-standing at top-flight football stadia. The party says the practice works safely in Europe and will lead to more choice, better atmosphere and cheaper tickets for fans.

"Britain's longest-running rail franchise came to an end on Saturday after more than 22 years. Virgin Trains, which began serving the West Coast Main Line in 1997, is being replaced by Avanti West Coast. Almost 500 million journeys have been made with Virgin Trains, which is co-owned by Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Group and Stagecoach. The final service pulled out of London Euston at 21:42 GMT, bound for Wolverhampton. But the historic day was marred by disruption when Virgin's last-ever London to Manchester service terminated early at Stockportdue to a train fault,externaljust before midnight. Earlier, Sir Richard tweeted his thanks to ""all our wonderful people"" and their ""incredible work"". Avanti West Coast, which will begin running the service on Sunday, told customers that tickets booked with Virgin Trains for upcoming journeys are still valid. Allow Twitter content?

The end of the franchise comes after Virgin Group and Stagecoachhad their bid to continue running trains on the line disqualifiedby the Department for Transport (DfT) in April because they did not meet pension rules. The companies are suing the DfT over its decision. At the time,Sir Richard saidhe was ""devastated"" by the disqualification. Virgin Trains, which is 49% owned by Stagecoach, introduced a series of innovations on the railways, including automatic delay compensation payments, a system to allow passengers to stream films and TV programmes on demand from their own devices, and the provision of digital tickets available for all fare types.

Rail expert Mark Smith, founder of Seat61.com, said the operator had, with the help of major infrastructure improvements, ""transformed"" its network by almost tripling passenger numbers and doubling services on some routes such as London to Glasgow. ""I think they've done pretty well,"" he said. ""They do have a certain panache and they communicate that to the staff and to the service. Quirky things like the toilets that talk to you, to onboard service with the food and wine. I'm going to be sorry to see them go."" The service has had a variable record - the proportion of Virgin trains which arrived at their final destination within 10 minutes of the timetable ranged from 33% in the final quarter of 2000 to 91% between July-September 2010. The latest figure, for July-September 2019, was 78%. Virgin Trains managing director Phil Whittingham, who will hold the same position with the new operator, said he was ""concentrating on a smooth handover"" to Avanti, adding: ""It's been a wonderful 22 years transforming services on the west coast and we're proud of everything our people have achieved in that time."" Avanti West Coast is owned by First Trenitalia, a partnership between Aberdeen-based FirstGroup and Italian firm Trenitalia. The operator said it would introduce a range of passenger improvements, including 263 more weekly services by 2022, when 23 new trains will begin service. The existing fleet of Pendolino trains will be refurbished - promising 25,000 new seats, more reliable wi-fi and better catering. Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""This election is now a fight for survival of NHS"" A row has broken out after Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn claimed he had ""proof"" the NHS was at risk under a post-Brexit trade deal with the US. Mr Corbyn said he had a 451-page dossier showing initial talks had taken place, proving the NHS was ""for sale"". But Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the claims were ""nonsense"" and the NHS would not be part of trade talks. The Tory manifesto explicitly states neither the price paid for drugs nor NHS services will be ""on the table"". Meanwhilethe SNP has published its manifestowhich includes a pledge to ""stop the NHS becoming a lever in any international trade deal"" through its NHS Protection Act. And other parties have criticised the Tories, including Liberal Democrat shadow Brexit secretary Tom Brake, who said the public would be ""horrified by what looks like a deal cooked up between the Tories and Donald Trump that puts our NHS on the table"". Could the NHS be ""up for sale"" to US companies? Reality Check: Five things from the leaked trade papers What we learned from the leaked US trade documents Jeremy Corbyn interview fact-checked Former Green Party leader Caroline Lucas said the Conservative Party ""can no longer claim the NHS is not for sale"", adding: ""Under their watch, it is."" This video can not be played Boris Johnson says Jeremy Corbyn's 451 page NHS dossier is a ""diversionary tactic"" Mark Dayan, policy analyst and the head of public affairs at the Nuffield Trust think tank said the NHS was not being ""flogged off"" in the sense that US companies will not own hospitals. But he said the documents suggest the US is trying various tactics to get the NHS to pay more money to their pharmaceutical companies for the drugs that they sell. ""Obviously from the NHS's point of view, that is a concern... you're really losing out in that situation,"" he said. Mr Dayan said if talks with the US continue, UK negotiators must ""push hard for the interests of the UK and the NHS"". This video can not be played Barry Gardiner and Andrew Neil on Labour claims about UK-US talks about the UK market for buying drugs. Labour obtained uncensored government documents covering six rounds of talks between US and UK officials in Washington and London between July 2017 and July 2019. They are all preparatory meetings ahead of formal trade talks. These documents provide more detail on the meetingsChannel 4's Dispatches programme reported,externalon last month. They show the US is interested in discussing drug pricing - mainly, extending patents that stop cheaper generic medicines being used. One document quotes a UK official saying the talks are helpful in determining the areas the US may want to discuss, while acknowledging the UK would have objections. As well as the pharmaceutical industry, the talks also covered other areas including agriculture and climate change. The UK team inquired about including a reference to climate change in any US-UK trade deal, something the US side said was not allowed by Congress. The document also refers to the US policy of making ""total market access"" a starting point in any trade talks - but says it is up to other countries to specify anything they want to be excluded from talks. There is no indication in the documents that the UK team agreed to anything in the talks. Jeremy Corbyn doesn't provide evidence ministers have agreed the health service should be part of a trade deal with US. But details of discussions about the demands of US pharmaceutical companies will still be motivating for Labour voters worried about the NHS. ""Not for sale,"" has been the biggest mantra at Labour events, even though the Tories have always furiously denied the NHS is in any way ""up for sale"". It's clear US drug companies want access to UK markets - Labour suggests the UK has agreed they could extend the patents on some medicines, which could cost the NHS more, for example. But whether any UK government would ever do a deal that made medicines much more expensive for the NHS, and therefore the taxpayer, which would be massively costly for the government and probably prove deeply unpopular, is a big political question. The Conservative manifesto says the NHS will not be on the table in post-Brexit trade talks. Currently, the NHS is able to use its bargaining power as a centralised health system to negotiate low prices for drugs. It also has a strong track record in resisting attempts to lengthen patents on drugs, to allow cheaper generics to be used more quickly than they are in the US. The US currently pays two and a half times more for drugs than the NHS does. Meanwhile, about 7% of the NHS budget in England goes on private companies that provide NHS services, mainly non-emergency treatments such as knee and hip replacements and some community services. And Labour has warned this market could be extended further under the Tories. Mr Corbyn said the documents showed talks were at a ""very advanced stage"" and gave the lie to Boris Johnson's claims the NHS would not be part of any trade talks. ""The uncensored documents leave Boris Johnson's denials in absolute tatters,"" he told a news conference in London. ""We have now got evidence that under Boris Johnson the NHS is on the table and will be up for sale. ""He tried to cover it up in a secret agenda and today it has been exposed."" Reacting to Mr Corbyn's latest claims, International Trade Secretary Liz Truss said it was simply a stunt. ""Jeremy Corbyn is getting desperate and is out and out lying about what the documents contain. ""People should not believe what he says."" Mr Johnson, meanwhile, said the claims were ""total nonsense"". ""This is continually brought up by the Labour Party as a diversionary tactic from the difficulties they are encountering,"" he said. And he could give an ""absolute cast iron guarantee"" the NHS would not be on the table. He also pointed out the documents had been available online for two months.

"Jeremy Corbyn holds up the leaked documents at a press conference on 27 November Boris Johnson has said an investigation is needed into the source of leaked documents on UK-US trade negotiations posted on Reddit. Labour says the documents show the NHS would be at risk under a post-Brexit trade deal with the US. On Friday, forum website Reddit said unredacted documents were uploaded as ""part of a campaign that has been reported as originating from Russia"". It has suspended 61 accounts that showed a ""pattern of coordination"". The government said it was looking into the matter with help from the National Cyber Security Centre. Speaking on Saturday, Mr Johnson said ""we do need to get to the bottom"" of the leak but said he had seen ""no evidence of any successful interference by Russia in any democratic event in this country"". What do the leaked papers actually say? UK-US trade document leak 'linked to Russia' The Culture Secretary Nicky Morgan said this all pointed towards foreign involvement: ""I understand from what was being put on that website, those who seem to know about these things say that it seems to have all the hallmarks of some form of interference."" Labour's shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald reiterated his call for Mr Johnson to release an intelligence report into Russian covert actions in the UK, whichNo 10 has been accused of suppressing until after the election. In a post on its site,external, Reddit did not provide any further details about the evidence behind its conclusions, nor did it identify any specific individuals. The BBC has approached the Russian foreign ministry spokesperson but they have yet to comment. The contents of the documents have played a significant part in Labour's election message on the NHS, afterMr Corbyn highlighted them at a press conference on 27 November. The Labour leader said the papers were evidence that the UK government was in advanced stages of negotiations with the US to open up the NHS to American pharmaceutical companies. Labour have not said where they obtained their copy of the documents. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn defends sharing leaked US-UK trade documents A version of the documents, heavily redacted, was also produced by Mr Corbyn at an earlier leader debate on 19 November. At the time, Labour said these were the result of a Freedom of Information request by campaign group Global Justice Now. The dossierwas posted on Reddit more than a month prior to Mr Corbyn's announcement, prompting questions about how they got there - and why few people seemed to notice them before. Analysis by political correspondent Jonathan Blake A bit like journalists never reveal their sources, Labour are quite happy to focus on what these documents say rather than where they come from. If you look at where Reddit's comments leave the discussion, it's both helpful and slightly problematic for Labour. On the one hand, people are asking ""where exactly did you get those documents from?"" Remember, they were online in their unredacted form for several weeks before Labour brought them to everyone's attention. But at the same time, we're still talking about these documents and what Labour claims that they show - that the NHS is up for sale, in their words. Boris Johnson and the Conservatives flatly deny that. So it's a double-edged sword for Labour. For the Conservatives, you've got this uneasiness around Russian interference in an election campaign - which isn't good for them because attention will turn to the report by Parliament which the government hasn't released. And that's not very helpful for the Tories either. Speaking on Saturday, the Labour leader said the controversy surrounding the source of the documents was ""nonsense"" and accused Mr Johnson of wanting to ""hide the issues and the truth"" over the future of the NHS in trade deals. Mr Johnson said the documents ""didn't prove what Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour party hoped it would prove"" adding ""it was just another distraction from the void at the heart of Labour's policy on Brexit"". This video can not be played Boris Johnson says leaked US-UK trade documents are 'just another distraction' Neither UK nor US governments have disputed the authenticity of the documents. Where did the leaked trade documents come from? The BBC's security correspondent Gordon Correra said crucial questions remained as to how the document circulating online originally appeared. He said there would be a significant difference between a state-led operation from Moscow which hacked the material and then leaked it as opposed to someone who is based in Russia simply opportunistically using an already leaked document to cause mischief.

Climate summit told of nation's 'fight to death' Greta Thunberg: People underestimate 'angry kids' Massive Attack help create carbon-zero tours Critical year for climate change begins in Madrid The hope among many here is that the scale of the march and her speech to the COP next week will give a big boost to the talks process that seem badly in need of a lift. This COP started with great hope last Monday, with strong words from the UN secretary-general and others,warning that time is running outand that negotiators should be guided by the science. Since then, the urgency has given way to frustration. Little obvious progress is being made on the central question of raising countries' ambitions to cut carbon. Indeed, UN climate chief Patricia Espinosa said the issue of increased pledges wasn't even on the agenda for the final outcome of this conference. ""We don't have in the agenda one item that's called 'ambition' and, therefore, it's not like we are expecting to have a specific decision on that."" In the face of several recent scientific reports stating that countries were falling further behind when it came to meeting the Paris agreement targets, this was a little disturbing, to say the least. UN climate chief Patricia Espinosa According to some experts at these talks, extra ambition would be great but equally important would be a firm timetable to deliver their pledges over the next 12 months, ahead of the Glasgow COP this time next year. Right now, that's not certain. ""It would be extremely concerning if the countries here in Madrid did not agree that there is a timeline for next year in coming forward with their commitments,"" said David Waskow from the World Resources Institute. ""That is a key outcome that we have to see here. It is not something that you can keep punting further and further away, this is something that requires immediate action."" Even the Pope is concerned. ""We must seriously ask ourselves if there is the political will to allocate with honesty, responsibility and courage, more human, financial and technological resources to mitigate the negative effects of climate change,"" Pope Francis said in a message to participants here. Much of what happens in Madrid could be governed by what happens in Brussels next week where aEuropean Green Deal,externalis set to be outlined by the incoming EU Commission. ""What the European Union does next week is a critical signal to the rest of the world that will shape the outcome in Madrid,"" said David Waskow. ""What happens in Brussels will resonate in Madrid."" Protestors at the COP showed the continuing influence of coal on the climate Another ongoing issue that is making people upset here is the question of climate justice. Much attention has been focussed on the attempts by poorer countries to finally get some traction around the question of loss and damage, the impacts of climate change from events that just can't be adapted to, such as sea-level rise or storms made more likely by rising temperatures. The hope from many is that here in Madrid, the developing nations would be heard and a mechanism with funding would be set up to deal with loss and damage. Again, there's been very little progress. Of course the question of climate justice is not just between countries but often within countries as well. ""The ones who contributed the most are the ones who feel the impacts the least,"" said Isadora Cardoso from campaign groupGenderCC - women for climate justice,external. ""Even within developed countries the poorest are the most affected whenever there are climate disasters or impacts, but they are not the ones who consume more and contribute the most to the causes of climate change."" There is still time to ensure a strong outcome in Madrid and the arrival of ministers next week will increase the sense of urgency - but right now there's a big disconnect between the size of the task and the willingness of countries to step forward with the pledges and the money needed to deal with the biggest challenge facing Planet Earth.

Well, a former aide now says he believes the PM may have been advised against it. In a clip from today's episode ofElectioncast - or ""Reflectioncast"", as the look-back-at-the-week version is known - Guto Harri adds that he thinks Mr Johnson would have wanted to do the interview.

The leader of the Liberal Democrats has a dig at the prime minister for not publishing an intelligence report into alleged Russian interference in UK democracy.

Democrat votes putting either Jeremy Corbyn or Boris Johnson into number
ten."" Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent Read our story on this: Reddit says UK-US trade talks document leak 'linked to Russia' Labour are saying nothing in fact about where they got the documents from. A bit like journalists never reveal their sources, Labour are quite happy to focus on what these documents say rather than where they come from, or at least how they came to be made public. I think it's worth focusing on exactly what Reddit have said here. Whilst they are clear that this document came to light as part of a coordinated effort by accounts that they have now suspended, they say only that they believe this was part of a campaign that's being reported as originating from Russia. So they're not identifying specific individuals who they know are Russian or living and operating in Russia and working to put documents such as this one out there in the public domain. But they have said it shows a pattern of coordination and linked it to a campaign originating in Russia which was identified by researchers relatively recently. So it does add a new dynamic to this narrative but I think if you look at where it leaves the discussion, it's both helpful and slightly problematic for Labour. On the one hand, people are asking 'where exactly did you get those documents from?' We have to remember of course that  they've been online in their un-redacted form for several weeks even before Labour brought them to everyone's attention. But at the same time, we're still talking about these documents and what Labour claims that they show. 'That the NHS is up for sale,' in their words. Boris Johnson and the Conservatives flatly deny that. So it's a bit of a double-edged sword. Add then for the Conservatives you've got this uneasiness around Russian interference in an election campaign which isn't good for them because then people will start talking about that report by Parliament which the government hasn't released. And that's not very helpful for the Tories either. Political leaders tweet... Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Jeremy Corbyn holds up the leaked documents at a press conference on 27 November Leaked documents detailing UK-US trade talks were posted on Reddit by an account linked to a campaign ""originating from Russia"", the online message board has said. In apost on Friday,external, the site said it had suspended 61 accounts that were part of a co-ordinated effort. The papers had their first wide burst of public attention when unveiled in the election campaign by Jeremy Corbyn. The government said it was ""looking into the matter"". There have been renewed calls for the government to make public a report into possible Russian interference in British elections. Mr Corbyn claimed the papers showed the NHS is ""for sale"" and Labour says their release was in the public interest. Reddit's post did not provide any further details about the evidence behind its conclusions. But it said a group of suspect accounts ""provides us with important attribution for the recent posting of the leaked UK documents, as well as insights into how adversaries are adapting their tactics"". Mr Corbyn and Boris Johnson continue to debatewhat the UK government documents actually mean- and the subject came up again duringFriday's televised BBC debate. The Labour leader, who firsthighlighted them at a press conference on 27 November,said they paved the way to higher drug costs and the privatisation of the National Health Service - a claim denied by Mr Johnson. Culture secretary Nicky Morgan said it was ""extremely serious"" that the leaked documents might be linked to a Russian disinformation campaign. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme she said: ""I understand, from what was being put on that [Reddit] website, those who seem to know about these things say that it seems to have all the hallmarks of some form of interference. ""And if that is the case, that obviously is extremely serious. And actually as culture secretary, obviously one of the things that we are looking for and monitoring is any interference in our elections."" Allow Twitter content?

Shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald renewed calls for the government to allow a report detailingRussian interference in UK elections to be published. He said: ""If we want to get to the bottom of the extent to which the Russian state interferes in elections, can we please publish the Intelligence and Security Committee report? ""Let's get that out there. That should have been published ages ago."" Where did the leaked trade documents come from? Hillary Clinton: 'Shameful' not to publish Russia report The documents themselveswere posted on Reddit more than a month priorto Mr Corbyn's announcement, prompting questions about how they got there - and why few people seemed to notice them before. Theoriginal Reddit post,externalcontaining the trade talks documents originated from an account with the user name ""gregoratior"". In itspost,external, Reddit said: ""We investigated this account and the accounts connected to it, and today we believe this was part of a campaign that has been reported as originating from Russia."" ""Suspect accounts on Reddit were recently reported to us, along with indicators from law enforcement, and we were able to confirm that they did indeed show a pattern of coordination,"" the post continued. The company also said the suspended accounts participated in vote manipulation but that ""none of these accounts or posts received much attention on the platform."" Reddit uses a ""karma"" points system - popular posts receive ""upvotes"" from other users that increase karma and drive the posts up page rankings. Following the original Reddit post, further attempts were made to draw attention to the documents via a Twitter account, as well as the fringe message board 4chan, websites in Germany and Austria, and an American conspiracy site. On Monday, researchers at Oxford and Cardiff universities, the Atlantic Council think tank and social media analysis firm Graphika said that the way the documents had been posted and spread onlineclosely resembled a Russian campaign,externaluncovered earlier in the year. Researchers dubbedthat earlier campaign,external""Secondary Infektion"" after a Soviet-era disinformation plot. The researchers who uncovered the earlier network pointed out that ""gregoratior"" used the same unusual combination of websites to spread the leaked documents. At several points, the account's posts seemed to be written by a non-native speaker of English. Similarly, the BBC determined that a post made by one of the accounts in German does not appear to be the writing of a native German speaker. During a previous leader debate on 19 November, Mr Corbyn produced heavily-redacted versions of the documents, and announced that they were the result of a Freedom of Information request. This video can not be played Moment Corbyn produces 'NHS dossier' That request was originally lodged by campaign group Global Justice Now. A spokesperson told the BBC that after the debate, the organisation was contacted via email and alerted to the presence of the uncensored documents on Reddit. The BBC attempted to contact ""gregoratior"" via Reddit and email, but we have not received a reply. A Reddit spokesperson said Friday: ""The integrity of our site continues to be of great importance, and we will continue to be transparent with our community and the public on these issues."" However the company did not release any specific details about the evidence it obtained from law enforcement or its own investigation. The Labour Party has not commented on how they obtained or became aware of the documents. A party spokesperson said: ""These documents reveal the plot against our NHS. And of course neither the UK nor the US government have denied their authenticity. Our releasing them to journalists was clearly in the public interest.""

Read our full story on the Brexit Party leader's visit here. The Sunday Times The Sunday Express The Sunday Telegraph The leader of the Lib Dems, Jo Swinson, has joined calls for the government to publish its intelligence report into Russian interference in the UK. The report, by Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee, was finalised in March and referred to No 10 on 17 October. ""It's shocking that the prime minister is sitting on a report from the intelligence and security committee into this very topic, into whether or not Russia or other countries have tried to interfere with our democracy. ""People have the right to know, when we are in an election, whether there has been democratic interference from other countries."" Ministers have said the report will be published after the election in line with procedures for ""sensitive"" information. The Mail on Sunday The Observer At a rally in Glasgow, Labour's John McDonnell tells supporters that the next five days are ""probably the most important days of our lives"". ""On Thursday we're going to realise a dream, a dream of a Labour government with a socialist programme,"" he says. ""I want to be there when Jeremy Corbyn turns up on his bike to Downing Street, takes off his bicycle clips, his cat under his arm, and walks into Number 10. ""Won't the establishment be quaking."" Let's hope Mr Corbyn's cat gets along with Downing Street's current feline resident, Chief Mouser to the Cabinet Office, Larry: Larry hasn't been best of friends with his neighbour, Palmerston, who works as Chief Mouser to the Foreign Office John McDonnell speaking at a campaign event earlier this month Labour's John McDonnell repeats his claim that there will be ""no deals"" with the SNP in the event of the party forming a minority government after the election. The shadow chancellor says it would focus on implementing its manifesto and other parties would have to determine which policies they support. The SNP's Nicola Sturgeon hasn't ruled out an informal pact with Labour, and previously set out a list of conditions for lending their support including allowing another Scottish independence referendum and scrapping the Trident nuclear deterrent. Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn were quizzed on the leaked UK-US trade documents while they were out and about campaigning today. If you need a reminder, Labour saysthe documentsshow the NHS would be at risk under a post-Brexit trade deal with the US. But the Conservatives flatly deny that. Speaking pitch-side at a football training session in Cheadle, Boris Johnson described the papers as ""just another distraction"" but said ""I do think we need to get to the bottom"" of the leak.

Well, a former aide now says he believes the PM may have been advised against it. In a clip from today's episode ofElectioncast - or ""Reflectioncast"", as the look-back-at-the-week version is known - Guto Harri adds that he thinks Mr Johnson would have wanted to do the interview. But Laura Parker, chief
coordinator of Momentum, says the UK public will not want a prime minister who is ""running scared"". The leader of the Liberal Democrats has a dig at the prime minister for not publishing an intelligence report into alleged Russian interference in UK democracy.  Speaking on a visit to a pub in St Albans, Hertfordshire, Jo Swinson tells us: ""It's shocking that the prime minister is sitting on a report from the intelligence and security committee into this very topic. ""The prime minister has decided that he will keep that secret and that is appalling. People have a right to know, when we are in an election, whether there has been democratic interference from other countries. ""Everybody should be worried if there's any sign that
there could be foreign interference in our own democratic election,"" she adds. No 10 has previously denied it's suppressing the report. She also says it's ""all to play for"" in the final days of the election campaign - and that there is no chance she would help either Jeremy Corbyn or Boris Johnson to form a government. ""I'm absolutely ruling out Liberal
Democrat votes putting either Jeremy Corbyn or Boris Johnson into number
ten."" Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent Read our story on this: Reddit says UK-US trade talks document leak 'linked to Russia' Labour are saying nothing in fact about where they got the documents from. A bit like journalists never reveal their sources, Labour are quite happy to focus on what these documents say rather than where they come from, or at least how they came to be made public. I think it's worth focusing on exactly what Reddit have said here. Whilst they are clear that this document came to light as part of a coordinated effort by accounts that they have now suspended, they say only that they believe this was part of a campaign that's being reported as originating from Russia. So they're not identifying specific individuals who they know are Russian or living and operating in Russia and working to put documents such as this one out there in the public domain. But they have said it shows a pattern of coordination and linked it to a campaign originating in Russia which was identified by researchers relatively recently. So it does add a new dynamic to this narrative but I think if you look at where it leaves the discussion, it's both helpful and slightly problematic for Labour. On the one hand, people are asking 'where exactly did you get those documents from?' We have to remember of course that  they've been online in their un-redacted form for several weeks even before Labour brought them to everyone's attention. But at the same time, we're still talking about these documents and what Labour claims that they show. 'That the NHS is up for sale,' in their words. Boris Johnson and the Conservatives flatly deny that. So it's a bit of a double-edged sword. Add then for the Conservatives you've got this uneasiness around Russian interference in an election campaign which isn't good for them because then people will start talking about that report by Parliament which the government hasn't released. And that's not very helpful for the Tories either. Political leaders tweet... Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Alistair McGhie, BBC Wales Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage has had a mixed reception on a visit to a South Wales rugby club this afternoon. He came to watch a game at Ebbw Vale in Blaenau Gwent. As he stood on the sidelines, some fans started a Jeremy Corbyn chant and one fan said that Mr Farage wasnât welcome. Others did greet Mr Farage. Heâs campaigning in an area that saw the biggest Leave vote in Wales in the 2016 referendum. The Westminster seat of Blaenau Gwent is held by Labour. When asked about his reaction to reports of Russian interference in leaked documents, Mr Farage said that the content of the documents is âsuspectâ. He criticised Labour's use of the documents. And when asked whether there is a problem with interference in British politics, he said: ""Not undulyâ. Jeremy Corbyn has been addressing a rally in Swansea this afternoon. He told the crowd that Labour would right ""the wrongs of the past,""  referencing the party's proposals for a mineworkers' pension scheme, overhauling the Universal Credit system and compensating so-called Waspi women. The Labour leader says Waspi women have been treated ""grievously"" by the Conservative government, reinforcing his pledge to commit Â£58 billion to compensate some of those who lost out as a result of changes to the pension age. Mr Corbyn says: ""It is a moral duty that this country pays that contract to them. And we will do exactly that. And that moral debt will be repaid in full."" He adds: ""It's also about righting wrongs of the past, those that suffered grievous industrial injuries and conditions in mines and steelworks and so many other places, and the nastiness of the Universal Credit system that drives so many people into death and poverty and desperation.""

"Thousands of council workers staged a strike over the dispute The company that led the equal pay legal action against Glasgow City Council has suspended all activities. Action 4 Equality Scotland said the move followed an approach by the Financial Conduct Authority over its failure to comply with new legislation. Director Stefan Cross QC insisted it would not affect the ongoing settlement process but could have an impact on future negotiations. The FCA would not confirm or deny any investigation. In October, aBBC Disclosuredocumentary raised questions about A4ES and the Â£500m deal it had done with Glasgow City Council. Claims management companies in England and Wales have been regulated for several years but this has only been the case in Scotland since April. Stefan Cross was the claims lawyer who acted for the majority of the women In astatement,external, Mr Cross said A4ES was unaware of the change in the law. It now intends to make an application to the FCA to become a regulated claims management company, a process that can take several months. The lawyer said the FCA approach was the reason the company had shut down the website. It has also decided not to take on any new clients and will not to be involved in any further direct negotiations as a representative. Mr Cross said the move would not affect the ongoing settlement process, which will now be handled by a law firm, but could have an impact on the claims of caterers employed by Baxter Storey. He added: ""It is very regrettable that this situation has occurred and I'd like to personally apologise to the women involved. However, I can reassure them that we have taken all necessary steps to ensure that their claims can proceed normally. ""The overriding priority has been to protect the interests of these women, and Addleshaw Goddard have been working with closely with us on these cases for the past six years, so are ideally placed to ensure a smooth continuation of their cases."" Last month, BBC Disclosure told how thousands of women who fought Glasgow City Council for equal pay have hadmoney deducted to pay legal fees, despite pledges from their unions. Members of Unison, Unite and the GMB were told they would get 100% of the settlement money offered. But BBC Disclosure obtained legal documents showing ""all claimants"" have had fees ""deducted"". Workers took party in a 48-hour strike over equal pay Employment lawyer Carol Fox later said she was ""troubled"" that women who were represented by unions had paid fees. She has alsocalled for an inquiryinto Glasgow City Council's equal pay settlement. The long-running dispute over women being paid less than men in jobs of the same grade was settled in January. Glasgow City Council agreed to pay out a reported Â£548m to compensate the women for the money they should have been paid, in many cases going back to 2006 when the new job evaluation scheme was adopted. The scheme was supposed to ensure that men and women received equal pay for jobs of the same value. But instead, some traditionally female-dominated roles such as catering or home care ended up being paid up to Â£3 an hour less than male-dominated jobs such as bin lorry workers or gardeners. The majority of the 16,000 equal pay claimants were represented by private claims company Action 4 Equality, run by Mr Cross. As part of this deal, it was agreed that every claimant would have a percentage of the settlement offered by the council deducted in legal fees. This included those backed by their unions. According to Mr Cross, 6.9% was deducted from all the claimants, with a proportion being paid to his company. In his interview with the BBC, Mr Cross acknowledged the percentage deducted equated to ""many millions"" of pounds. He said: ""The unions' proposal was that we had to agree parity, to start with. The cost of that is that fees had to be paid somehow. And this is the most fair, most beneficial way for everybody that we did it on that basis.""

"Three years ago, Scottish rugby legend Doddie Weir was given the devastating news he had motor neurone disease. Doddie's doctor told him he would be in a wheelchair within a year. Half of sufferers can expect to live for about 18 months. But the former Scotland and Lions star never left the rugby field without a fight, and he was determined that he would not give in to the disease. Three years on, he is still walking, still going to his boys' rugby matches, still battling MND - and on a mission to find a cure. Doddie's eldest son Hamish noticed something was amiss with his father on the family farm Back in 2016, Doddie's son Hamish had spotted the signs that something was wrong before he knew his dad was sick. Doddie had taken him for ""one of their chats"", a walk around the family farm in the Borders. Hamish said: ""We took a rugby ball and we passed it backwards and forwards and he struggled a lot with his left hand. ""But you know what he is like, he said it would be fine."" But things wouldn't be fine. Later that year, Doddie shut his hand in a door. It hurt, and it kept hurting. Long after it should have healed, his hand started to twitch. At the end of 2016, Doddie was told he had motor neurone disease. His wife Kathy recalled the exact moment that changed their lives forever. ""When we were sat in that doctor's office and he said, 'You have MND' it was a big blow to me. It was a shock. ""We know things aren't going to be the same and we are not going to get that long retirement thing that we planned for. ""But at least we've got the time and the warning. We've been given this chance to make the most of our lives."" Doddie Weir playing against England in 1997 Doddie Weir is one of the best-known names in Scottish rugby history. The 49-year-old started playing rugby for Stewart's Melville RFC. He went on to play for Melrose in the Borders, winning multiple Scottish championships with the club before joining Newcastle Falcons in 1995. He won 61 Scottish caps through the 90s, and was selected for the British and Irish Lions tour of South Africa in 1997. A big favourite with the Murrayfield crowd, the 6ft 6in lock was famously described by commentator Bill McLaren as as being ""on the charge like a mad giraffe"". Away from the pitch he is best known as the man in the tartan suit - a sportsman and speaker, TV pundit, businessman and family man. Doddie and Kathy kept the news to themselves over Christmas and told family in January 2017. They didn't go public until after son Hamish had sat his exams the following spring. They decided to make the announcement on world MND Day - 19 June - in an effort to raise awareness of the condition. Doddie launched his foundation in 2017 Doddie promised he was going to raise money to help with research and to help people with motor neurone disease. MND is the name of a group of illnesses affecting the nerves controlling motor functions - the movement of muscle. MND stops signals reaching the muscles. Over time the muscles weaken and stop working, inhibiting the ability to walk, talk, eat or drink unaided. There is currently no cure and only one medicine has been licensed in the UK in the last 25 years, which can prolong life for about one to two months. High-profile sufferers include scientist Stephen Hawking, footballer Fernando Ricksen and campaigner Gordon Aikman. In August 2017, Doddie gave an interview to his fellow Scotland rugby star, BBC broadcaster John Beattie. John would follow his progress for the next two years to compile theBBC Scotland documentary Doddie Weir: One More Try, which was broadcast on BBC One Scotland on 6 December. Doddie was angry and frustrated, saying it wasn't acceptable to have a condition for which there was no cure. While there are exceptions - Stephen Hawking died 55 years after his diagnosis - about half of sufferers die within three years of developing symptoms. This video can not be played Doddie Weir: 'The support has been mind-boggling' Doddie used the interview to launch his charity, the My Name'5 Doddie Foundation, and said he wanted to ""stop the disease"". There were tears when he said wanted to see his boys grow up, learn to drive, give them advice about girlfriends and do the things his dad did for him. At this point, the MND was mainly affecting Doddie's hands, making everyday tasks like fastening a button difficult. Frustration would be the prevalent emotion over the next two years - frustration at the medical profession, and frustration at the lack of help after his diagnosis. Kathy said: ""Doddie is just desperate to try something. ""He is good at the moment and we need to keep going on. ""He'll be here in five years, 10 years' time. He'll have got the cure by then."" As the year went on, Doddie began showing more physical signs of decline. His shoulders had wasted. His hands had deteriorated. He joked about needing two hands to lift a pint. Joost van der Westhuizen was an inspiration for Doddie Doddie Weir is not the first rugby international to face MND. In 2011,South Africa's Joost van der Westhuizen revealed he had been diagnosed with the condition. Doddie met Joost at Murrayfield many years before his illness and found him an inspirational character. Joost died in early 2017, not long after Doddie's own diagnosis. Doddie studied his J9 Foundation, which seeks to raise awareness as well as improve the emotional and physical care of MND sufferers. Doddie's foundation has now spent Â£4m over the last two years - Â£3.5m on research and Â£500,000 to help improve people's lives by providing cash for things like stair lifts, holidays and wheelchairs. It is also working on an end of life care package for patients. The most important tip Doddie took from Joost was the benefit of positive thinking. ""Use it or lose it"" became his mantra. Doddie and his sons delivered the game ball at Murrayfield soon after the public learned of his diagnosis By 2018, the family was trying to cram a lifetime of memories into as short a time as possible. One of those memories came in November when Doddie and his teenage sons Hamish, 18, Angus, 17, and Ben, 15 , delivered the match day ball before Scotland's match with New Zealand at Murrayfield. Hamish said: ""As soon as I walked out it was amazing. It was the support that hit me. I was speechless. Looking back it was surreal and an experience I'll never have again. ""Gregor Townsend played a part in getting dad out. But I think that was the point when it hit dad. ""You could see him welling up, that's when it hit me.  I think Gregor told them to go out and do it for Doddie. It was a great moment."" Doddie also wrote his autobiography, My Name'5 Doddie - a reference to his number five shirt number -  and said one of the reasons was to let his sons know what he got up to on the tours with the Lions. The family have thrown themselves into the fundraising campaign During 2018 Doddie and his foundation trustees also agreed their first investment into MND Research - Â£400,000 to support the work of Chris Shaw, Professor of Neurology and Neurogenetics, and his team at King's College London. They are spearheading work on gene therapy for Sporadic Motor Neurone Disease. That came as more signs of the disease were starting to show. Doddie said he was trying not to lose weight and joked that he never had a lot of muscle in the first place. He said: ""I can keep walking, talking, eating and sleeping unaided. ""Dressing is hard work. Eating, bringing hands to my mouth and drinking is getting more difficult. ""I'm maybe very lucky in some ways. It's directly started with my hands. Other people it starts with their voice, their eating, their legs. So in a way I can still do everything, although things are maybe a little bit slower than they used to be."" He said hardest part was when people said thank you. ""Sympathy is lovely to get but hard to take. It's just the emotional side of things that is hitting us hard,"" he said. A pod has been built onto the side of the Weirs' home The start of 2019 was accompanied by building work at the Weirs' home in the Borders. A pod was fixed onto the side of the house which put all of Doddie's accommodation on the ground floor for when he needs it. He explained: ""This is for the eventuality that I can't go upstairs in the house. A room will be converted into my bedroom. The pod is at the side of the house and that can be moved on to someone else at a later date."" Doddie's engagements were cut back and he gave up his day-to-day work. But he has also made more memories, picking up his OBE for services to rugby and to charity from the Queen at the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh. Doddie with wife Kathy and sons Hamish, Ben and Angus after receiving his OBE from the Queen at the Palace of Holyroodhouse He said: ""It's another memory for myself and the family and this horrendous MND. ""Hopefully one day together we'll all get a cure and I'll be here to annoy a lot of people for a long time. That's the goal."" However, June 2019 brought devastating news to the Weir family. Doddie's beloved mother, Nanny, died after more than two years battling cancer. Her second diagnosis came at the same time as Doddie was diagnosed with MND. Speaking shortly after her funeral, Doddie said: ""Life has been pretty tough of late, losing mother. But it's one of the sure things that does happen. She had cancer and she was very strong."" Her death made Doddie contemplate the future. He said: ""I just wake up and get on with it. With Kathy - it must be difficult for her. I can see what is happening long-term, but she - bless her - can't do anything about it. ""We have a cuddle now and again to bring us all together and appreciate what we've got. ""I am one of the lucky ones - two-and-a-half years in and I am still here."" John Beattie followed Doddie Weir through a difficult two years At the start of filming, neither Doddie nor John Beattie expected he would still be reasonably mobile by the time of their last interview in November 2019. Despite what he was warned about three years ago, there is still no feeding tube, no oxygen mask, no stair lift. But things have changed. Doddie is thinner. He also has to cut his food up small and sometimes he wears a neck brace. He has just returned from a family holiday to Majorca where he choked on a piece of toast. ""The first one went down okay,"" said Doddie. ""The second one got stuck in my throat. I had to ask for a serious bit of help from my good lady. If Kathy wasn't there and she didn't thump me in the back, I could have been in a bit of serious trouble."" He has had several falls. He says he has been complacent and needs to be aware of his condition. Apart from that, he is still doing everything he was doing nine months ago. Doddie at the Scottish Parliament campaigning for automatic access to the blue badge scheme for people with MND He said: ""Why the progress is so slow we do not know. I don't think the professionals know either. But I am still here, still living life and still continuing."" He tells John: ""The setting of goals now is smaller - getting up the stairs or getting out to check the cows. And getting to the weekend to watch the boys' rugby."" But there is still one big goal - the big party which is being planned for his 50th birthday in July next year. Talking about this causes Doddie to break down. He is emotional talking about family. Doddie has also reconsidered his view on rugby's part in his disease. Speaking in 2017, he wassceptical about any link between the sport and the condition. He now says that, with hindsight, there could have been ""some sort of incidental connection"". Doddie recalled being injured while playing in a game four years ago. ""They say these sort of collisions could have an effect on the brain,"" he said. ""Looking back it was probably not long after that injury that I got MND. But there are a lot of people who get MND who don't play rugby."" Doddie's next goal is his 50th birthday next June Doddie says he doesn't regret letting the camera into his family's lives. ""The reason for doing this is to try to explain the frustrations,"" he said. ""From the day we were told I had MND there's been nothing on the table that people with MND can get hold of. That's unacceptable. The journey with the camera is to tell people what's out there, to tell people to keep a positive outlook - because that's the best and only drug that's available at the moment."" Doddie says he and Kathy are closer now because she has to do more for him - which now includes shaving. The boys are helping too. He said: ""The kids are doing things not a lot of teenagers don't need to do - like having to help dress their old boy. But that's life. They are adapting well."" Doddie won't let MND encroach on his life. He has still not agreed to having a peg (feeding tube) in his stomach. He said: ""In my head it's giving in. ""If I allowed the peg to go in, I wouldn't be able to swim - and swimming and aqua aerobics are an important part of keeping me where I am. ""I'm not giving in. If you give in what's the point of living? To me, the kids have still got a lot to do, and I'd like to support them. ""If you give in, I think the whole body gives in. That'll be the end and I don't want that to happen."" Doddie Weir: One More Tryis available on the BBC iPlayer.

"Three years ago, Scottish rugby legend Doddie Weir was given the devastating news he had motor neurone disease. Doddie's doctor told him he would be in a wheelchair within a year. Half of sufferers can expect to live for about 18 months. But the former Scotland and Lions star never left the rugby field without a fight, and he was determined that he would not give in to the disease. Three years on, he is still walking, still going to his boys' rugby matches, still battling MND - and on a mission to find a cure. Doddie's eldest son Hamish noticed something was amiss with his father on the family farm Back in 2016, Doddie's son Hamish had spotted the signs that something was wrong before he knew his dad was sick. Doddie had taken him for ""one of their chats"", a walk around the family farm in the Borders. Hamish said: ""We took a rugby ball and we passed it backwards and forwards and he struggled a lot with his left hand. ""But you know what he is like, he said it would be fine."" But things wouldn't be fine. Later that year, Doddie shut his hand in a door. It hurt, and it kept hurting. Long after it should have healed, his hand started to twitch. At the end of 2016, Doddie was told he had motor neurone disease. His wife Kathy recalled the exact moment that changed their lives forever. ""When we were sat in that doctor's office and he said, 'You have MND' it was a big blow to me. It was a shock. ""We know things aren't going to be the same and we are not going to get that long retirement thing that we planned for. ""But at least we've got the time and the warning. We've been given this chance to make the most of our lives."" Doddie Weir playing against England in 1997 Doddie Weir is one of the best-known names in Scottish rugby history. The 49-year-old started playing rugby for Stewart's Melville RFC. He went on to play for Melrose in the Borders, winning multiple Scottish championships with the club before joining Newcastle Falcons in 1995. He won 61 Scottish caps through the 90s, and was selected for the British and Irish Lions tour of South Africa in 1997. A big favourite with the Murrayfield crowd, the 6ft 6in lock was famously described by commentator Bill McLaren as as being ""on the charge like a mad giraffe"". Away from the pitch he is best known as the man in the tartan suit - a sportsman and speaker, TV pundit, businessman and family man. Doddie and Kathy kept the news to themselves over Christmas and told family in January 2017. They didn't go public until after son Hamish had sat his exams the following spring. They decided to make the announcement on world MND Day - 19 June - in an effort to raise awareness of the condition. Doddie launched his foundation in 2017 Doddie promised he was going to raise money to help with research and to help people with motor neurone disease. MND is the name of a group of illnesses affecting the nerves controlling motor functions - the movement of muscle. MND stops signals reaching the muscles. Over time the muscles weaken and stop working, inhibiting the ability to walk, talk, eat or drink unaided. There is currently no cure and only one medicine has been licensed in the UK in the last 25 years, which can prolong life for about one to two months. High-profile sufferers include scientist Stephen Hawking, footballer Fernando Ricksen and campaigner Gordon Aikman. In August 2017, Doddie gave an interview to his fellow Scotland rugby star, BBC broadcaster John Beattie. John would follow his progress for the next two years to compile theBBC Scotland documentary Doddie Weir: One More Try, which was broadcast on BBC One Scotland on 6 December. Doddie was angry and frustrated, saying it wasn't acceptable to have a condition for which there was no cure. While there are exceptions - Stephen Hawking died 55 years after his diagnosis - about half of sufferers die within three years of developing symptoms. This video can not be played Doddie Weir: 'The support has been mind-boggling' Doddie used the interview to launch his charity, the My Name'5 Doddie Foundation, and said he wanted to ""stop the disease"". There were tears when he said wanted to see his boys grow up, learn to drive, give them advice about girlfriends and do the things his dad did for him. At this point, the MND was mainly affecting Doddie's hands, making everyday tasks like fastening a button difficult. Frustration would be the prevalent emotion over the next two years - frustration at the medical profession, and frustration at the lack of help after his diagnosis. Kathy said: ""Doddie is just desperate to try something. ""He is good at the moment and we need to keep going on. ""He'll be here in five years, 10 years' time. He'll have got the cure by then."" As the year went on, Doddie began showing more physical signs of decline. His shoulders had wasted. His hands had deteriorated. He joked about needing two hands to lift a pint. Joost van der Westhuizen was an inspiration for Doddie Doddie Weir is not the first rugby international to face MND. In 2011,South Africa's Joost van der Westhuizen revealed he had been diagnosed with the condition. Doddie met Joost at Murrayfield many years before his illness and found him an inspirational character. Joost died in early 2017, not long after Doddie's own diagnosis. Doddie studied his J9 Foundation, which seeks to raise awareness as well as improve the emotional and physical care of MND sufferers. Doddie's foundation has now spent Â£4m over the last two years - Â£3.5m on research and Â£500,000 to help improve people's lives by providing cash for things like stair lifts, holidays and wheelchairs. It is also working on an end of life care package for patients. The most important tip Doddie took from Joost was the benefit of positive thinking. ""Use it or lose it"" became his mantra. Doddie and his sons delivered the game ball at Murrayfield soon after the public learned of his diagnosis By 2018, the family was trying to cram a lifetime of memories into as short a time as possible. One of those memories came in November when Doddie and his teenage sons Hamish, 18, Angus, 17, and Ben, 15 , delivered the match day ball before Scotland's match with New Zealand at Murrayfield. Hamish said: ""As soon as I walked out it was amazing. It was the support that hit me. I was speechless. Looking back it was surreal and an experience I'll never have again. ""Gregor Townsend played a part in getting dad out. But I think that was the point when it hit dad. ""You could see him welling up, that's when it hit me.  I think Gregor told them to go out and do it for Doddie. It was a great moment."" Doddie also wrote his autobiography, My Name'5 Doddie - a reference to his number five shirt number -  and said one of the reasons was to let his sons know what he got up to on the tours with the Lions. The family have thrown themselves into the fundraising campaign During 2018 Doddie and his foundation trustees also agreed their first investment into MND Research - Â£400,000 to support the work of Chris Shaw, Professor of Neurology and Neurogenetics, and his team at King's College London. They are spearheading work on gene therapy for Sporadic Motor Neurone Disease. That came as more signs of the disease were starting to show. Doddie said he was trying not to lose weight and joked that he never had a lot of muscle in the first place. He said: ""I can keep walking, talking, eating and sleeping unaided. ""Dressing is hard work. Eating, bringing hands to my mouth and drinking is getting more difficult. ""I'm maybe very lucky in some ways. It's directly started with my hands. Other people it starts with their voice, their eating, their legs. So in a way I can still do everything, although things are maybe a little bit slower than they used to be."" He said hardest part was when people said thank you. ""Sympathy is lovely to get but hard to take. It's just the emotional side of things that is hitting us hard,"" he said. A pod has been built onto the side of the Weirs' home The start of 2019 was accompanied by building work at the Weirs' home in the Borders. A pod was fixed onto the side of the house which put all of Doddie's accommodation on the ground floor for when he needs it. He explained: ""This is for the eventuality that I can't go upstairs in the house. A room will be converted into my bedroom. The pod is at the side of the house and that can be moved on to someone else at a later date."" Doddie's engagements were cut back and he gave up his day-to-day work. But he has also made more memories, picking up his OBE for services to rugby and to charity from the Queen at the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh. Doddie with wife Kathy and sons Hamish, Ben and Angus after receiving his OBE from the Queen at the Palace of Holyroodhouse He said: ""It's another memory for myself and the family and this horrendous MND. ""Hopefully one day together we'll all get a cure and I'll be here to annoy a lot of people for a long time. That's the goal."" However, June 2019 brought devastating news to the Weir family. Doddie's beloved mother, Nanny, died after more than two years battling cancer. Her second diagnosis came at the same time as Doddie was diagnosed with MND. Speaking shortly after her funeral, Doddie said: ""Life has been pretty tough of late, losing mother. But it's one of the sure things that does happen. She had cancer and she was very strong."" Her death made Doddie contemplate the future. He said: ""I just wake up and get on with it. With Kathy - it must be difficult for her.

Read our full story on the Brexit Party leader's visit here. The Sunday Times The Sunday Express The Sunday Telegraph The leader of the Lib Dems, Jo Swinson, has joined calls for the government to publish its intelligence report into Russian interference in the UK. The report, by Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee, was finalised in March and referred to No 10 on 17 October. ""It's shocking that the prime minister is sitting on a report from the intelligence and security committee into this very topic, into whether or not Russia or other countries have tried to interfere with our democracy. ""People have the right to know, when we are in an election, whether there has been democratic interference from other countries."" Ministers have said the report will be published after the election in line with procedures for ""sensitive"" information. The Mail on Sunday The Observer At a rally in Glasgow, Labour's John McDonnell tells supporters that the next five days are ""probably the most important days of our lives"". ""On Thursday we're going to realise a dream, a dream of a Labour government with a socialist programme,"" he says. ""I want to be there when Jeremy Corbyn turns up on his bike to Downing Street, takes off his bicycle clips, his cat under his arm, and walks into Number 10. ""Won't the establishment be quaking.""

The shadow chancellor says it would focus on implementing its manifesto and other parties would have to determine which policies they support. The SNP's Nicola Sturgeon hasn't ruled out an informal pact with Labour, and previously set out a list of conditions for lending their support including allowing another Scottish independence referendum and scrapping the Trident nuclear deterrent. Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn were quizzed on the leaked UK-US trade documents while they were out and about campaigning today. If you need a reminder, Labour saysthe documentsshow the NHS would be at risk under a post-Brexit trade deal with the US. But the Conservatives flatly deny that.

Well, a former aide now says he believes the PM may have been advised against it. In a clip from today's episode ofElectioncast - or ""Reflectioncast"", as the look-back-at-the-week version is known - Guto Harri adds that he thinks Mr Johnson would have wanted to do the interview. But Laura Parker, chief
coordinator of Momentum, says the UK public will not want a prime minister who is ""running scared"". The leader of the Liberal Democrats has a dig at the prime minister for not publishing an intelligence report into alleged Russian interference in UK democracy.  Speaking on a visit to a pub in St Albans, Hertfordshire, Jo Swinson tells us: ""It's shocking that the prime minister is sitting on a report from the intelligence and security committee into this very topic. ""The prime minister has decided that he will keep that secret and that is appalling. People have a right to know, when we are in an election, whether there has been democratic interference from other countries. ""Everybody should be worried if there's any sign that
there could be foreign interference in our own democratic election,"" she adds. No 10 has previously denied it's suppressing the report. She also says it's ""all to play for"" in the final days of the election campaign - and that there is no chance she would help either Jeremy Corbyn or Boris Johnson to form a government. ""I'm absolutely ruling out Liberal
Democrat votes putting either Jeremy Corbyn or Boris Johnson into number
ten."" Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent Read our story on this: Reddit says UK-US trade talks document leak 'linked to Russia' Labour are saying nothing in fact about where they got the documents from. A bit like journalists never reveal their sources, Labour are quite happy to focus on what these documents say rather than where they come from, or at least how they came to be made public. I think it's worth focusing on exactly what Reddit have said here. Whilst they are clear that this document came to light as part of a coordinated effort by accounts that they have now suspended, they say only that they believe this was part of a campaign that's being reported as originating from Russia. So they're not identifying specific individuals who they know are Russian or living and operating in Russia and working to put documents such as this one out there in the public domain. But they have said it shows a pattern of coordination and linked it to a campaign originating in Russia which was identified by researchers relatively recently. So it does add a new dynamic to this narrative but I think if you look at where it leaves the discussion, it's both helpful and slightly problematic for Labour. On the one hand, people are asking 'where exactly did you get those documents from?' We have to remember of course that  they've been online in their un-redacted form for several weeks even before Labour brought them to everyone's attention. But at the same time, we're still talking about these documents and what Labour claims that they show. 'That the NHS is up for sale,' in their words. Boris Johnson and the Conservatives flatly deny that. So it's a bit of a double-edged sword. Add then for the Conservatives you've got this uneasiness around Russian interference in an election campaign which isn't good for them because then people will start talking about that report by Parliament which the government hasn't released. And that's not very helpful for the Tories either. Political leaders tweet... Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Alistair McGhie, BBC Wales Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage has had a mixed reception on a visit to a South Wales rugby club this afternoon. He came to watch a game at Ebbw Vale in Blaenau Gwent. As he stood on the sidelines, some fans started a Jeremy Corbyn chant and one fan said that Mr Farage wasnât welcome. Others did greet Mr Farage. Heâs campaigning in an area that saw the biggest Leave vote in Wales in the 2016 referendum. The Westminster seat of Blaenau Gwent is held by Labour. When asked about his reaction to reports of Russian interference in leaked documents, Mr Farage said that the content of the documents is âsuspectâ. He criticised Labour's use of the documents. And when asked whether there is a problem with interference in British politics, he said: ""Not undulyâ. Jeremy Corbyn has been addressing a rally in Swansea this afternoon. He told the crowd that Labour would right ""the wrongs of the past,""  referencing the party's proposals for a mineworkers' pension scheme, overhauling the Universal Credit system and compensating so-called Waspi women. The Labour leader says Waspi women have been treated ""grievously"" by the Conservative government, reinforcing his pledge to commit Â£58 billion to compensate some of those who lost out as a result of changes to the pension age. Mr Corbyn says: ""It is a moral duty that this country pays that contract to them. And we will do exactly that. And that moral debt will be repaid in full."" He adds: ""It's also about righting wrongs of the past, those that suffered grievous industrial injuries and conditions in mines and steelworks and so many other places, and the nastiness of the Universal Credit system that drives so many people into death and poverty and desperation.""

"Labour has the strongest policies to protect nature and combat climate change, a Friends of the Earth (FoE) survey suggests. Its election pledges narrowly beat the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats â with the Conservatives far behind. One key climate policy area is aviation, and Labour has now announced plans for a levy on people who take frequent flights. The FoE league table marks the parties on 45 policy points. The environmental campaign group's scores are: Labour - 33 Greens - 31 Lib Dems - 30 Conservatives - 5.5 FoE spokesman Dave Timms said: ""Environmental issues have been given greater priority in this election than ever before â and with the world in the midst of an ecological and climate crisis this must be the next governmentâs top priority. âMany of the policies that Labour, the Liberal Democrats and Green Party have put forward are commensurate with, or striving to meet, the challenges we face. âIt is disappointing we have not seen the same urgency, ambition or consistency from the Conservative Party.â The result will be a shock to the Green Party, whose overriding concern is protecting the planet and who typically top the environment policy charts by a wide margin. This video can not be played What to look out for on climate change and the environment in this election The Greens complained the scoring should only have included commitments made in manifestos. But in a bid for the youth vote, Labour has challenged the Greens by devoting the top section of its manifesto to tackling the environment crisis. How far do the parties' climate promises go? How much will this be a climate change election? Who should I vote for? Our manifesto guide One high-scoring policy in the FoE survey is on aviation. Labour has been under pressure from trades unions to safeguard jobs in the industry. But after correspondence with Friends of the Earth, the party strengthened its position by backing a frequent flyer levy on the 15% of people who take 70% of flights. A letter to the group from four Labour shadow cabinet ministers also promised to review its Aviation National Policy Statement against much tougher carbon targets. What about Heathrow? Labour said expansion at Heathrow would be cancelled if it was not consistent with climate targets. A Labour government would also divert funds from the roads programme for public transport, the party says. The Greens did not provide any more clarification or policies to strengthen their manifesto. Mr Timms said: ""Labourâs manifesto contains strong, funded policies on home energy efficiency and renewables. This was boosted by significant additional pledges during the campaign on plans for tree planting, food policy, public transport and cycling. ""The Lib Dems and Greens both scored well, and had policies roughly commensurate with the scale of the crisis."" He added: âThe Conservatives have some good policies  - especially on agriculture â but in sector after sector its commitments were invariably weaker than the other parties', entirely absent or just plain bad.â The Conservatives are committed to a Â£28.8bn road-building programme that experts say is not compatible with carbon targets because, even if the cars of the future are electric, gathering the resources to make the cars will still generate emissions. The Tories said their climate targets were world-leading but road congestion had to be tackled. Follow Roger on Twitter@rharrabin,external How far do the parties' climate promises go?

"Thousands of council workers staged a strike over the dispute The company that led the equal pay legal action against Glasgow City Council has suspended all activities. Action 4 Equality Scotland said the move followed an approach by the Financial Conduct Authority over its failure to comply with new legislation. Director Stefan Cross QC insisted it would not affect the ongoing settlement process but could have an impact on future negotiations. The FCA would not confirm or deny any investigation. In October, aBBC Disclosuredocumentary raised questions about A4ES and the Â£500m deal it had done with Glasgow City Council. Claims management companies in England and Wales have been regulated for several years but this has only been the case in Scotland since April. Stefan Cross was the claims lawyer who acted for the majority of the women In astatement,external, Mr Cross said A4ES was unaware of the change in the law. It now intends to make an application to the FCA to become a regulated claims management company, a process that can take several months. The lawyer said the FCA approach was the reason the company had shut down the website. It has also decided not to take on any new clients and will not to be involved in any further direct negotiations as a representative. Mr Cross said the move would not affect the ongoing settlement process, which will now be handled by a law firm, but could have an impact on the claims of caterers employed by Baxter Storey. He added: ""It is very regrettable that this situation has occurred and I'd like to personally apologise to the women involved. However, I can reassure them that we have taken all necessary steps to ensure that their claims can proceed normally. ""The overriding priority has been to protect the interests of these women, and Addleshaw Goddard have been working with closely with us on these cases for the past six years, so are ideally placed to ensure a smooth continuation of their cases."" Last month, BBC Disclosure told how thousands of women who fought Glasgow City Council for equal pay have hadmoney deducted to pay legal fees, despite pledges from their unions. Members of Unison, Unite and the GMB were told they would get 100% of the settlement money offered. But BBC Disclosure obtained legal documents showing ""all claimants"" have had fees ""deducted"". Workers took party in a 48-hour strike over equal pay Employment lawyer Carol Fox later said she was ""troubled"" that women who were represented by unions had paid fees. She has alsocalled for an inquiryinto Glasgow City Council's equal pay settlement. The long-running dispute over women being paid less than men in jobs of the same grade was settled in January. Glasgow City Council agreed to pay out a reported Â£548m to compensate the women for the money they should have been paid, in many cases going back to 2006 when the new job evaluation scheme was adopted. The scheme was supposed to ensure that men and women received equal pay for jobs of the same value. But instead, some traditionally female-dominated roles such as catering or home care ended up being paid up to Â£3 an hour less than male-dominated jobs such as bin lorry workers or gardeners. The majority of the 16,000 equal pay claimants were represented by private claims company Action 4 Equality, run by Mr Cross. As part of this deal, it was agreed that every claimant would have a percentage of the settlement offered by the council deducted in legal fees. This included those backed by their unions. According to Mr Cross, 6.9% was deducted from all the claimants, with a proportion being paid to his company. In his interview with the BBC, Mr Cross acknowledged the percentage deducted equated to ""many millions"" of pounds. He said: ""The unions' proposal was that we had to agree parity, to start with. The cost of that is that fees had to be paid somehow. And this is the most fair, most beneficial way for everybody that we did it on that basis.""

"This video can not be played Corbyn vs Johnson: BBC election debate roundup Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn clashed over Brexit in the final head-to-head debate before the 12 December election. During the live debate, Mr Corbyn said Labour would bring Brexit ""to an end"" by negotiating a new deal and putting it back to the public in a referendum, alongside a Remain option. Mr Johnson said he had ""a wonderful deal"", and would use it to take the UK out of the EU on 31 January. Other topics covered included the NHS, security and Northern Ireland. Early on in the debate - hosted by Today presenter Nick Robinson - the Labour leader said he would negotiate a new withdrawal agreement with the EU within three months before putting it to a final say referendum - alongside Remain - within six months. The prime minister countered by saying he already had a withdrawal agreement in place, and would use it to leave the EU next month if he won a working majority in Parliament. But Nick Robinson challenged Mr Johnson, pointing out that while he had a withdrawal deal in place, he did not have a trade deal with the EU, and so could not rule out a no-deal exit in January 2021. Kuenssberg: No fireworks moment in debate Corbyn and Johnson TV debate fact-checked Five key things in the BBC's Johnson-Corbyn debate Who should I vote for? Election 2019 manifesto guide Coming into the event, Labour and the Conservatives had spent the day arguing over how Mr Johnson's Brexit deal might affect Northern Ireland. Laboursaid a leaked document showedMr Johnson's agreement would have a ""devastating"" impact on Northern Ireland. When the subject arose in the debate, Mr Corbyn said of his rival: ""He spoke at a DUP conference and said there would be no [trade] restrictions [after Brexit] whatsoever, we now know there are restrictions."" But Mr Johnson was met with applause from the audience when he said he found it ""slightly curious"" to be lectured about the union by Mr Corbyn, referring to the Labour leader's past support for those who want to see a united Ireland. This video can not be played Corbyn and Johnson clash over NHS Like Brexit, the NHS has featured heavily in the campaign so far - and Friday's debate was no different. Faith, a student nurse in the audience, asked how each leader would deal with a shortage of NHS nurses. The Conservative leader said a government run by him would ""encourage nurses overseas to come"" to the UK ""by shortening the time for their visa applications"" and by reintroducing bursaries for training. Mr Corbyn described the NHS as at ""breaking point"", adding that, under a Labour government, ""Â£40bn in total would go into the NHS in order to fund it properly"". The Labour leader also repeated one of his main attack lines of the campaign - that a Tory government would allow the NHS to form part of a future trade deal with the US. However, Mr Johnson described that claim as ""Bermuda Triangle stuff"". Responding to the performances of Mr Corbyn and Mr Johnson, SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon tweeted: ""That was utterly woeful. Two uninspiring men, both of them unsuited to be PM."" Meanwhile, Amelia Womack, of the Green Party, told the BBC: ""I find it frustrating, as a younger woman, that we weren't discussing things that are relevant to my generation - whether that's house prices, rental prices, freedom of movement across Europe, or even zero-hour contracts."" Plaid Cymru's Liz Saville Roberts said the debate felt like a ""shoddy end-of-term pantomime"", and said both men displayed a ""lack of honesty"". She added that, contrary to the claims of Mr Johnson, the ""chaos"" of Brexit ""is going to go on"", even if the UK leaves the EU next month. And the Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesman Tom Brake said: ""Tonight's debate was British politics at its worst. Two leaders offering nothing new, nothing different and neither being honest about the pain Brexit will cause our communities."" The prime minister and Mr Corbyn were also asked about security - an issue that has risen to prominence sincethe London Bridge attack on 29 November. Both candidates were asked by an audience member if they would prioritise the safety of citizens over human rights. Mr Corbyn said the choice was ""not an either/or"". He added the UK could not have security ""on the cheap"", and so Labour would ""back the police up"" with an increase in officer numbers. When it came to his turn, Mr Johnson referred to the London Bridge attack, and said it was ""extraordinary and wrong"" that the attacker was given automatic early release from prison after an earlier terrorism conviction. In a campaign where both parties have sought to repeatedly talk about their key themes, tonight did not diverge radically from the script. Boris Johnson came under pressure on the issue of trust - and whether his Brexit plan would mean checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Jeremy Corbyn was once again pressed on his failure to pick a side on Brexit - and questioned on why Europe would offer Labour a new deal when so many frontbenchers back Remain. Both men landed punches. But none of them were critical. And given that polls suggest the Conservatives are ahead in the polls - that might suit Boris Johnson more than Jeremy Corbyn.

"Xiyue Wang, who was held in Iran for three years, was greeted by US Ambassador to Switzerland Edward McMullen The US and Iran have conducted a prisoner swap in a rare sign of co-operation between the two countries. The exchange involved a Chinese-American researcher convicted of spying in Iran and an Iranian scientist held by the US. Both deny wrongdoing. Iran's foreign minister said he was glad as he announced the exchange. Hours later, US President Donald Trump tweeted: ""Thank you to Iran on a very fair negotiation,external. See, we can make a deal together!"" Xiyue Wang was arrested in Iran in 2016 for ""collaborating with foreign governments"". Massoud Soleimani, a stem cell expert, was arrested at a Chicago airport last year. He was accused violating trade sanctions by trying to export biological material to Iran. Iran and the US have had an increasingly strained relationship in recent years and share no diplomatic links. Both have thanked the Swiss government for its assistance as an intermediary facilitator. Mr Wang was flown in a Swiss government plane from Tehran to Zurich, and then to Ramstein Air Base in Germany, where he will undergo medical check-ups before heading home. Mr Soleimani was also flown to Zurich and then on to Iran. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif tweeted photos of himself with Mr Soleimani after his release.

"Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn have faced off in a head-to-head debate â the last time they are scheduled to meet before election day. BBC Reality Check looked at their claims during the hour-long debate. Reality Check:Boris Johnson talked about his plans for 50,000 more nurses in the NHS in England by the end of the next parliament (ie five years). Of these, 31,500 would be new nurses (19,000 newly-trained recruits and 12,500 overseas recruits). The remaining 18,500 would be existing nurses persuaded not to quit, or to come back. We've previouslylooked in more depth at how realistic this goal is. The Conservatives also say they will build and fund 40 hospital projects over 10 years - this has been repeatedly questioned in the campaign. The party's manifesto says they are proud ""to have begun work on building 40 new hospitals across the country"". They all have one thing in common - there is no building work happening as yet. There will be Â£2.7bn over five years for the first six hospitals. For the remaining 34 projects, just Â£100m is available to develop business cases. Are these 'new' hospitals actually new? Reality Check:One of the most commonly used measures of estimating children in poverty is usingthe Households Below Average Income (HBAI) statistics,external. It estimates how many children live in UK households which earn 60% less than the median income. There are two different ways it goes about doing this. The relative low income figure is used by think tanks like the Resolution Foundation, and gives us an estimate of 4.1 million in 2017-18, or about 30% of children. The Conservatives prefer to use the ""absolute"" figure, which is useful in comparing one year with another. Measured this way, the estimate would be 3.7 million children, or about 26%. Reality Check:Labour's spending plans are nowhere near Â£1.2tn a year. That's the Conservatives' estimate of the extra spending Labour would make during the whole of the next parliament (ie five years). The Conservatives first made this costing of Labour's plans before either party's manifesto was published. When Labour's manifesto was published, some items that the Conservatives had costed were not in it. But the Tories repeated the analysis and reached the same figure of an increase in government spending of Â£1.2tn over the course of the parliament. That translates to Labour spending an extra Â£240bn a year, but theindependent Institute for Fiscal Studiescosted it at Â£180bn extra a year by the year 2023-4. Also, the Conservatives' analysis makes a number of questionable assumptions - including that a Labour government reaches full-speed spending on its first day in office, instead of building up to it over five years. It prices Labour's nationalisations at Â£255bn. This is even more costly than the price tag suggested in ahotly contested analysis by employers' organisation the CBI(Â£196bn). It says the four-day week will cost Â£85bn during the parliament - when Labour have set a four-day week asan ambition over ten years. Reality Check:Labour's manifesto said that the party's day-to-day spending commitments would be matched by raising taxes. Their investment spending would be covered by borrowing. But, a few days after the manifesto was published, Labour made a further spending pledge - a Â£58bn compensation package to women who lost out to changes in the state pension. Reality Check: It is correct to say that the UK would be able to ban live animal exports after it leaves the EU, and the transition period ends. Under EU single market rules, no member state can ban live animal exports. The EU does put a number of animal welfare restrictions on exporting live animals. It is an offence to transport them in a way likely to cause injury of undue suffering. Animals have to be provided with adequate space as well as food, water and rest. Can the UK ban live animal exports after Brexit? The Conservative manifesto pledged to abolish VAT on sanitary products, which is currently 5%. This would be possible after the transition, when the UK will not bound by the EU laws which currently do not allow that tax to fall below 5%. The EU is also in the process of changing EU law so that VAT on sanitary products can be reduced to zero, but thiswill not take effect until 2022 at the earliest,external. Reality Check:Jeremy Corbyn defended Labour's plans to raise corporation tax (that's the tax companies pay on their profits). Mr Corbyn is right that it would be lower than the rate in 2010-11, when it stood at 28%. When it comes to standard rates of corporation tax, according to figures from the OECD, France currently has a rate of 31%, but the United States has a rate of 21% (although individual states levy extra taxes on top).

"Labour plans to make England's entire bus fleet electric by 2030 with a Â£4bn investment, if it wins the general election. This would reduce bus emissions by more than 70%, cutting air pollution and helping to tackle climate change, the party said. But Conservatives claim the plans are part of ""Labour's war on the motorist"". More than 3,000 bus routes have been cut or reduced over the past decade,campaigners said in October. Labour said its plans would boost British manufacturing and help ""revitalise our high streets and rebuild local communities"". There are 35,000 buses in England but only 700 are electric, and mostly in London, Labour said. Labour says the cost of this policy will be under Â£4bn over a 10-year period and will come from Labour's Green Transformation Fund. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""The Westminster bubble doesn't care about buses but cuts to bus routes leave so many people isolated, stuck at home and unable to make vital trips out. ""Away from London, many people have approached me in this election to talk about their local bus route closing down."" Andy McDonald, shadow transport secretary, added: ""The Tories' manifesto didn't pledge a penny to reverse a decade of cuts to local bus services."" CONFUSED?Our simple election guide,external MANIFESTO GUIDE:Who should I vote for?,external POSTCODE SEARCH:Find your local candidates,external POLLS:How are the parties doing?,external A TO Z:Our tool to explain election words,external Labour would give local authorities the power to create council-owned bus companies, replace cuts to bus funding and invest more (at a cost of Â£1.3bn a year), and provide free bus travel to under-25s in areas that bring bus services under local ownership (at a cost of Â£1.4bn a year by the end of the parliament), it said. The funding will be drawn from Vehicle Excise Duty - formerly known as road tax - with Department for Transport money directed away from road building. The pricing is based on the cost of buying new electric buses, and reimbursing bus owners for phasing out fossil fuel vehicles before the normal end of road life. While bus services are devolved, Labour said it would make money available across the UK. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said: ""Labour's war on the motorist continues apace. ""Labour won't be able to deliver a modern bus network because they would raid the roads budget and scrap vital new roads and upgrades to fund their fantasy giveaways."" The Conservatives have pledged to ""help local authorities to partner with bus companies to create new superbus networks"" and make Â£50m available ""to develop the first all-electric bus town or city"". Road campaigners said in October that bus service funding has been slashed over a decade. Local authority funding for bus services fell by more than 40% over that time, while central government funding fell by 19%, the Campaign for Better Transport said in October. However, the Department for Transport said at the time it supported local bus services with a Â£250m annual grant to keep fares lower. Liberal Democrat shadow transport secretary Wera Hobhouse said on Friday: ""The steady degradation of bus services by the Conservatives across the UK is a disgrace. ""The Liberal Democrats would spend Â£4.8bn on restoring bus routes over the next five years.

"This video can not be played 'Sydney's mega fire is getting out of control' A ""mega blaze"" raging across a 60km (37 mile) front north-west of Sydney cannot currently be put out, Australian fire officials have warned. The fire across almost 300,000 hectares (1,150 sq miles) is an hour's drive from the nation's most-populous city. People who cannot defend their property from approaching fires have been told they should leave immediately. Since October, bushfires have killed six people and destroyed more than 700 homes across Australia.

At one point on Friday, nine fires had been raised to emergency level warnings, although these decreased markedly amid a brief respite in conditions later in the day. The blazes north of Sydney were sending black fumes across the city, causing a rise in medical problems. NSW RFS deputy commissioner, Rob Rogers told national broadcaster ABC: ""We cannot stop these fires, they will just keep burning until conditions ease, and then we'll try to do what we can to contain them."" He said the 60km stretch from Hawkesbury to Singleton was ""just fire that whole way"". Video footage from the Orangeville area showed firefighters running from a wall of fire and the Walkabout Wildlife Park has evacuated hundreds of animals.

The Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) said that ""some fires were too big to put out"" while the NSW RFS said late Friday the blazes would only be extinguished ""when we get good rain"". This video can not be played Firefighters flee intense flames in Sydney, in a video shared by them to show the dangers of bushfires Sydney may be blanketed in smoke for weeks, if not months. It hasn't come close to the fatalities of 2009, when nearly 200 people died, but the scale of the damage has been huge. How bad is bushfire smoke for health? Toxic smoke affects golfers at Australian Open More than 1.6 million hectares of land have burned in New South Wales alone. The season has hit earlier than normal and has been exacerbated by drought conditions. RFS Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said: ""There is an absolute lack of moisture in the soil, a lack of moisture in the vegetation... you are seeing fires started very easily and they are spreading extremely quickly, and they are burning ridiculously intensely."" The BOM says thatclimate change has led to an increase in extreme heat events,externaland raised the severity of other natural disasters, such as drought. Last week, the bureau noted that NSW had endured its driest spring season on record. It also warned that Australia's coming summer was predicted to bring similar conditions to last year's - the nation's hottest summer on record.

"Hospitals across England are using 21 separate electronic systems to record patient health care - risking patient safety, researchers suggest. A team at Imperial College say the systems cannot ""talk"" to each other, making cross-referencing difficult and potentially leading to ""errors"". Of 121 million patient interactions, there were 11 million where information from a previous visit was inaccessible. The NHS said it was working to ensure different systems could work together. The electronic medical records (EMRs) systemwas launched in 2002with the aim of allowing clinicians easy access to all the information on a patient, even if they had previously been treated elsewhere. But it has been plagued with delays and operational problems ever since. The team from London's Imperial College's Institute of Global Health Innovation (IGHI) looked at data from 152 acute hospital trusts in England, focusing on the use of EMRs on the ward. Around a quarter were still using paper records. Half of trusts using EMRs were using one of three systems: researchers say at least these three should be able to share information. Ten per cent were using multiple systems within the same hospital. Writing in the journal BMJ Open, the researchers say: ""We have shown that millions of patients transition between different acute NHS hospitals each year. ""These hospitals use several different health record systems and there is minimal coordination of health record systems between the hospitals that most commonly share the care of patients."" Dr Leigh Warren, who worked on the research, said: ""Patients expect their health records to be shared seamlessly between hospitals and healthcare settings that they move between. ""They cannot understand why, in the NHS, this is not the case."" ""Yet hospitals and GPs often don't have the right information about the right patient in the right place at the right time. ""This can lead to errors and accidents that can threaten patients' lives."" Lord Ara Darzi, lead author and co-director of the IGHI, said: ""It is vital that policy-makers act with urgency to unify fragmented systems and promote better data-sharing in areas where it is needed most - or risk the safety of patients."" A spokesperson for NHSX, which looks after digital services in the NHS, said: ""NHSX is setting standards, so hospital and general practioner IT systems talk to each other and quickly share information, like X-ray results, to improve patient care.
