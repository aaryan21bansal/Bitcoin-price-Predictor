"Sixteen and 17-year-olds across the UK are now being invited to book their Covid vaccine. GPs in England have been told they can contact this age group, while invites are also being sent out in Wales. In Northern Ireland, walk-in centres are now open to older teenagers, and in Scotland they can register their interest online. Meanwhile, new figures show most patients in hospital with Covid in England continue to be unvaccinated. Children aged 12 to 17 who are at higher risk of getting ill if they catch Covid - or live with people who have a weak immune system - have already been able to get vaccinated. In England 240,870 under-18s had received a first dose by 1 August. The opening of vaccinations to all 16 and 17-year-olds in England comes amid a drive to encourage young people to get jabbed. The vaccine's benefits will be promoted to partygoers in nightclubs, including Ministry of Sound and Heaven. A campaign will also be rolled out across social media channels including Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat and TikTok, as well as on radio stations Kiss, Capital, Heart, Sunrise, and TalkSport, urging young adults to get jabbed. Walk-in centres in England will begin accepting people aged 16 and 17 from next week, but those in that age group are currently unable to book an appointment using the NHS website. Fifth of England Covid hospital cases aged 18-34 Infections and hospital cases down - is Covid over? How many people have been vaccinated so far? In Northern Ireland people aged 16 and up have begun to get the vaccine. Elliot Aston, 16, from Newtownards told the PA News Agency it was good his age group was able to get the jab as ""we are probably the ones that are out and about the most"". Bethany Holden, 16, who was among the first to receive the vaccine at the SSE Arena in Belfast on Friday, said she was glad to get the jab as she was ""more protected and protecting other people as well"". Bethany Holden said she got the vaccine to protect herself and others Children aged 12 to 15 who are clinically vulnerable to Covid or live with adults who are at increased risk of serious illness from the virus will be contacted by the NHS and invited for their vaccine over the coming weeks, NHS England said. Jabs will also be offered to children aged 12 years and over who live with someone who is immunosuppressed, such as those receiving chemotherapy or who have had a transplant, with NHS England saying more than a million children and young people could now get the jab. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the vaccines were ""building a wall of defence against the virus"" and were ""the best way to protect people from serious illness"". Since 19 July, 1,467 people have been admitted to hospital with cases of the Delta variant, Public Health England (PHE) said. Out of these 808 (55.1%) were unvaccinated, while 512 (34.9%) had received both doses. PHE said: ""While vaccines provide high levels of protection, they are not 100% effective and will not stop everyone catching Covid-19. ""As more of the population gets vaccinated, we will see a higher relative percentage of vaccinated people in hospital."" Dr Jenny Harries, chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency, stressed vaccines would not eliminate all risk and it was still possible to become unwell with Covid-19 and infect others. ""It is still vital that we exercise caution, particularly while cases are high,"" she added. Some 88.8% of the UK's adult population have now had one dose of a coronavirus vaccine, while 73.8% have had both jabs. Delta remains the dominant variant in the UK, making up about 99% of cases. The brunt of Covid in the UK is clearly being born by the unvaccinated. Only one in ten adults have now not had a single dose of the vaccine, and children rarely become severely ill. So it is hugely telling when more than half of those in hospital are from the unvaccinated minority. But this shouldn't be a surprise. The latest estimate by the UK's Vaccine Effectiveness Expert Panel says two doses cuts the chance of you needing hospital treatment by 95% if you catch Delta. That's not perfect, vaccines aren't an impenetrable shield; and yes there are still people in hospital who had both jabs. But the way vaccines are rapidly transforming the pandemic - at least in wealthier countries - is incredible. On Friday 31,808 new cases of Covid werereported across the UK,externalalong with a further 92 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Prof Sir Ian Diamond, the UK's national statistician, told the BBC the UK was seeing evidence of a decline in Covid infections across the country. He said rates were still relatively high in many areas, but he expected to see a ""continued decline"" over the next four or five weeks. He warned that he did not think ""we're in a position to say we have reached the end of Covid"" and said people should not stop showing a degree of caution. The R number - which represents the average number of people one infected person will pass the virus on to - has also fallen in England to between 0.8 and 1.1,according to the latest government figures,external. Last week it was estimated as between 1.1 and 1.4. When the R number is above one, the number of cases keeps increasing. INSTATRADERS:Is foreign exchange trading a trustworthy route to extra cash?

"The attack on the tanker as it sailed past the Omani island of Masirah killed two people The US military's Central Command has announced the results of its forensic investigation into last week's fatal drone attack on a merchant tanker off Oman. It says explosives experts concluded that the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) was produced in Iran. The evidence has been shared with explosives experts in Britain and Israel who concurred with the findings. The attack on the MT Mercer Street killed two people. The vessel is managed by the London-based Zodiac Maritime, a company owned by Israeli shipping magnate Eyal Ofer. A British security guard, Adrian Underwood, and the ship's Romanian captain lost their lives as the ship sailed past the Omani island of Masirah. Britain, the US, Israel and Romania, were quick to blame Iran which has denied any involvement. It said if there was any proof then it should be made public. Now a statement from Centcom has shed some light on what it says its investigation has revealed. Throughout the past week an explosive investigations team from the US Navy's aircraft carrier the USS Ronald Reagan has been examining the evidence left behind by the drone attack. After interviewing the survivors and studying the explosive residue they have concluded that the ship was targeted by three drones in all. The first two, launched at the ship on the evening of Thursday 29 July, missed their target. But the third drone, launched early on Friday 30 July and loaded with a military grade explosive, hit the pilot house and exploded, killing the two men and leaving a 2-metre diameter hole. Investigators say explosive chemical tests had identified the residue as RDX, a nitrate-based explosive, indicating that the UAV was rigged to cause injury and destruction. The investigators also recovered part of the drone's wing and after further testing they concluded that the drone was produced in Iran. A joint statement issued by all the G7 nations on Friday condemned Iran's actions and said its actions threatened peace and stability. An explosive investigations team from the US Navy's aircraft carrier the USS Ronald Reagan has examined evidence left behind Iran and Israel have been engaged in an undeclared and so-called ""shadow war"" for some time now. Israel is widely assumed to be behind a series of sabotage acts on Iran's nuclear programme, including the assassination of key scientists. It has also attacked Iranian ships suspected of carrying oil to Syria that is destined for Iran's militia ally in Lebanon, Hezbullah. EXPLAINED: Iran and Israel's shadow war UK and Iran summon diplomats after tanker attack Iran has been targeting Israeli-linked shipping with limpet mines, something which the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps train intensively for. But last week's deadly drone attack marked a major escalation, killing some of those onboard and dragging in a major western power. Days later there was a second attack on shipping with armed men briefly seizing control of another merchant tanker, the MV Asphalt Princess, before leaving it to go on its way. The incidents come at a time of heightened tension in the region as the new, hardline President Ebrahim Raisi takes power in Iran and talks aimed at reviving the moribund deal to curb Iran's suspect nuclear programme falter in Vienna.

"Afghan government forces and allied militia are fighting against the Taliban in key cities across the country Afghan journalists who work for the British media will be allowed to relocate to the UK if they are under ""imminent threat"" from the Taliban, the foreign secretary has said. In a letter to UK media organisations, Dominic Raab said cases would be considered ""on an exceptional basis"". British news outlets had urged No 10 to treat Afghan journalists the same as the British Army's Afghan interpreters. It comes asa top Afghan media officer was killed by the Taliban on Friday. Dawa Khan Menapal, the director of Afghanistan's media and information centre, was shot dead as he was leaving a mosque in his car in the Afghan capital of Kabul. The Taliban said he had been ""punished for his deeds"". Taliban militants continue to make rapid advances in Afghanistan, taking swathes of countryside and targeting key cities, following the decisions by US and Nato forces to leave the country.

The Foreign and Development Office has updated its travel advice to urge Britons to leave by commercial means, and to make the British embassy in Kabul aware of their plans. Top Afghan media officer assassinated in Kabul Indian photojournalist killed in Afghanistan Taliban capture first Afghan regional capital Mr Raab's letter follows a plea from a group of newspapers and broadcasters who wrote to the UK government to urge that Afghan journalists, translators and fixers be treated the same as interpreters who worked for the British armed forces. Since 2013, some Afghan interpreters who had put their lives at risk by working with the British military have been permitted to relocate to the UK, with their families. Mr Raab wrote that the ""freedom"" of global media outlets was a ""priority"" for the government. He added: ""The vibrant Afghan media is one of the greatest successes in Afghanistan in the last 19 years, and it should be celebrated and protected. ""Your letter highlighted the threat faced by Afghan staff who have worked for your media organisations in Afghanistan, in particular the risk of reprisals they face from the Taliban from their association with the UK. ""Under existing schemes, we are able to consider individual cases for relocation on an exceptional basis, where there is evidence they are under imminent threat due to the nature of their engagement with the UK. ""Journalists (and those supporting them) can be eligible for our support, depending on the individual circumstances that apply.""

On Thursday a flight of 104 people, made up of interpreters and their family members, arrived at a Midlands airport as part of the UK's ongoing relocation programme. One interpreter, called H, said that while he was happy for his wife and children to be in Britain he was sad to have left his family behind. Last month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said all British troops assigned to Nato's mission in Afghanistanwould be returning home, and most had already left. The US has said it will withdraw all forces by 11 September. But Britain's most senior general, General Nick Carter, warnedAfghanistan could slide into civil war once foreign troops leave.

"Hossam Metwally recorded himself performing alleged exorcism rituals on his drugged partner An anaesthetist who poisoned his partner in a series of botched exorcism ceremonies is facing jail. Hossam Metwally, 61, performed a ""dangerous perversion"" of the Islamic Ruqya ritual on Kelly Wilson at the couple's home in Grimsby. Sheffield Crown Court heard she suffered multiple organ failure from being injected with drugs. Jurors found Metwally guilty of eight charges, including administering a noxious substance and a count of fraud. An eight-week trial heard Metwally, an NHS anaesthetist and chronic pain specialist, believed Ms Wilson was possessed by supernatural spirits known as jinns. He believed there were a number of the entities ""hiding"" inside his partner, the court heard, and that he had to remove them by reciting verses of the Koran and placing holy water and oils on her skin. Jurors heard he had performed more than 250 rituals, and made dozens of recordings over a four-year period starting in 2016. Extracts from 200 clips were shown to the jury, in which Metwally could be heard chanting ""Bismillah Allah-hu-Akbar"" as he administered fluids through a cannula to Ms Wilson as she lay on a bed. In one, a black restraint is tied to a drugged and drowsy Ms Wilson's wrist as Metwally chants before pausing to mention a jinn called Magdulina, asking Ms Wilson: ""Did you get her?"" ""Bismillah. Go to them in your head,"" he says repeatedly. Jurors also heard from an imam during the trial that the Ruqya was considered a valid practice but would never involve drugs or sedation. Metwally was arrested after Ms Wilson fell into a coma on 4 July 2019. She was on the brink of a cardiac arrest and was taken to hospital that afternoon. During investigations police found a ""vast stock of drugs"" at his home, including ketamine, propofol, fentanyl and Diazemuls. Hossam Metwally had a ""vast stock of drugs"" at his Grimsby home Following Metwally's conviction on Thursday, Judge Jeremy Richardson QC said he had ""never been involved in a more bizarre case"". After lifting reporting restrictions on Friday, Judge Richardson told Metwally, who worked at Northern Lincolnshire and Goole NHS Foundation Trust (NLGNFT): ""It is a shocking circumstance that a doctor, a medical professional, should find himself in the dock awaiting sentence on such a serious criminal charge."" Metwally, who qualified in his native Egypt, also worked in Saudi Arabia before practising in the UK. He moved to Grimsby in 1999, three years after arriving in the country, the court heard. The pair met when Ms Wilson, now 33, was training to be a nurse in 2015. She worked at Metwally's private pain clinic and later moved in with him at his home in Laceby Road. Jurors heard the former nurse was lonely, had a history of depression and suffered a catalogue of illnesses which resulted her in quitting her job. Prosecutor John Elvidge QC said the medic was secretly giving various drugs to Ms Wilson including fentanyl and ketamine, and had ""knowingly fed her addiction"" for drugs. Metwally was found guilty of endangering Ms Wilson's life by administering anaesthetic drugs to sedate Ms Wilson; the supply of various controlled drugs or medicines and the possession of a controlled drug with intent to supply. He was also found guilty of one count of fraud. It took the jury less than 90 minutes to reach unanimous verdicts on the charges. Reporting restrictions were lifted after he also admitted two unrelated voyeurism offences. Judge Richardson told Metwally a prison term ""of some substance"" would be inevitable at his sentencing hearing on 20 September. Dr Kate Wood, medical director at NLGNFT, said Metwally was ""immediately excluded"" from working at the trust when the allegations came to light and reported to the General Medical Council. Chris Hartley from the Crown Prosecution Service said Metwally was a ""dangerous"" man who had ""cruelly and deliberately"" exploited Ms Wilson. ""By administering powerful anaesthetic and sedative drugs outside the safety of a hospital setting he was not only deliberately injuring Ms Wilson; he was endangering her life,"" he said.

"Kane has scored 221 goals for Tottenham, which puts him second on their all-time goalscorers list behind Jimmy Greaves Tottenham striker Harry Kane says he has ""never refused to train"" and will return to the club on Saturday as planned. Kane, who has been on an extended holiday after Euro 2020,did not turn up as scheduledon Monday for his coronavirus tests. Manchester City are keen to sign the England captain. The 28-year-old believes he has a gentleman's agreement with chairman Daniel Levy to leave Spurs this summer. He says that he has been ""hurt"" by comments this week that questioned his professionalism. ""While I won't go into the specifics of the situation, I want to clarify that I would never, and have never, refused to train. I will be returning to the club tomorrow as planned,"" he wrote onTwitter.,external ""I wouldn't do anything to jeopardise the relationship I have with the fans who have given me such unwavering support during my time with the club. This has always been the case as it is today."" Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola has confirmed the club'sinterest in Kane, but they are not thought to be willing to meet Spurs' Â£160m valuation. New Tottenham manager Nuno Espirito Santo sayshe has yet to speak to the strikersince his arrival at the club last month. Kane, who joined Tottenham at the age of 11, has three years remaining on the six-year deal he signed in 2018. He scored 23 top-flight goals last season to claim the Premier League Golden Boot for a third time, having previously won the award in 2015-16 and 2016-17. He also has 221 Tottenham goals to his name, which puts him second on their all-time goalscorers' list behind Jimmy Greaves, who scored 266 times for the club between 1961 and 1970.

"The fall of Zaranj will be seen as a heavy blow to Afghan government forces (pictured) A city in southwestern Afghanistan has become the first provincial capital to fall to the Taliban since the militants launched a sweeping offensive earlier this year. Local officials said the Taliban had captured Zaranj, in Nimroz province, in a major blow to government forces. The insurgents continue to make rapid advances across the country as foreign troops withdraw. They have taken swathes of countryside and are now targeting key cities. Other provincial capitals under pressure include Herat in the west, and the southern cities of Kandahar and Lashkar Gah. The UN's special envoy for Afghanistan, Deborah Lyons, on Friday said the war there had entered a ""new, deadlier, and more destructive phase"", with more than 1,000 civilians killed in the past month. She warned that the country was heading for ""catastrophe"", and called on the UN Security Council to issue an ""unambiguous statement that attacks against cities must stop now"". Later on Friday, the UK government advised all its citizens in Afghanistan to leave because of the worsening security situation. Taliban insurgents claimed victory in Zaranj - a major trading hub near the Iranian border - in a post shared on Twitter. ""This is the beginning, and see how other provinces fall in our hands very soon,"" a Taliban commander told Reuters news agency. Pictures posted on social media showed civilians looting items from government buildings. Taliban insurgents were photographed inside the local airport and posing at the entrance to the city. The militants made a sustained bid to seize the city after capturing surrounding districts. But Nimroz's Deputy Governor Roh Gul Khairzad told reporters that Zaranj had fallen ""without a fight"". She and other local officials complained of a lack of reinforcements from the Afghan government. ""The city was under threat for a while, but no one from the central government listened to us,"" Ms Khairzad said. PROFILE:Who are the Taliban? ANALYSIS:How the Taliban retook half of Afghanistan ON THE GROUND:Bodies on the streets as fighting traps Afghans The last time the Taliban captured a provincial capital was in 2016, when they briefly held the northern city of Kunduz. The militants launched a major military campaign in May, to coincide with the phased withdrawal of US and Nato forces after 20 years of military operations. The capture of Zaranj will add to their momentum, analysts say. Overnight, US and Afghan forces launched air strikes on the group's positions in Lashkar Gah, the capital of Helmand province. Government troops have vowed not to lose the strategically significant city, and fighting there has been fierce. Officials have urged civilians to evacuate, with thousands trapped or fleeing for their lives. In Herat, people have also been fleeing their homes in anticipation of a government offensive against Taliban positions. ""We have nothing left and we do not know where to go,"" one resident told AFP news agency. Earlier on Friday, the director of Afghanistan's government media centre wasassassinated by Taliban militants in the capital, Kabul. Dawa Khan Menapal was shot dead as he left a mosque in his car. The Taliban said he had been ""punished for his deeds"". Afghan government colleagues condemned the killing as shocking and cowardly. US ChargÃ© d'Affaires to Afghanistan Ross Wilson tweeted that he was ""saddened and disgusted"" by the killing, adding: ""These murders are an affront to Afghans' human rights and freedom of speech."" Days earlier, an attack on the Afghan defence minister's house in Kabul left at least eight people dead. The minister, Bismillah Khan Mohammadi, was not at home at the time. At a UN Security Council meeting on Friday, representatives voiced concerns over the growing bloodshed. Afghanistan's envoy Ghulam Isaczai called on the Security Council to take action to pressure the militants to halt their attacks and take part in meaningful peace talks. ""It is our collective responsibility to stop them from destroying Afghanistan and threatening the world community,"" he said. Meanwhile, the chair of the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission told the BBC that countries within the region in particular needed to tell the Taliban that coming to power through violence would mean that their government would not be recognised.

In one, a black restraint is tied to a drugged and drowsy Ms Wilson's wrist as Metwally chants before pausing to mention a jinn called Magdulina, asking Ms Wilson: ""Did you get her?"" ""Bismillah. Go to them in your head,"" he says repeatedly. Jurors also heard from an imam during the trial that the Ruqya was considered a valid practice but would never involve drugs or sedation. Metwally was arrested after Ms Wilson fell into a coma on 4 July 2019. She was on the brink of a cardiac arrest and was taken to hospital that afternoon. During investigations police found a ""vast stock of drugs"" at his home, including ketamine, propofol, fentanyl and Diazemuls. Hossam Metwally had a ""vast stock of drugs"" at his Grimsby home Following Metwally's conviction on Thursday, Judge Jeremy Richardson QC said he had ""never been involved in a more bizarre case"". After lifting reporting restrictions on Friday, Judge Richardson told Metwally, who worked at Northern Lincolnshire and Goole NHS Foundation Trust (NLGNFT): ""It is a shocking circumstance that a doctor, a medical professional, should find himself in the dock awaiting sentence on such a serious criminal charge."" Metwally, who qualified in his native Egypt, also worked in Saudi Arabia before practising in the UK. He moved to Grimsby in 1999, three years after arriving in the country, the court heard. The pair met when Ms Wilson, now 33, was training to be a nurse in 2015. She worked at Metwally's private pain clinic and later moved in with him at his home in Laceby Road. Jurors heard the former nurse was lonely, had a history of depression and suffered a catalogue of illnesses which resulted her in quitting her job. Prosecutor John Elvidge QC said the medic was secretly giving various drugs to Ms Wilson including fentanyl and ketamine, and had ""knowingly fed her addiction"" for drugs. Metwally was found guilty of endangering Ms Wilson's life by administering anaesthetic drugs to sedate Ms Wilson; the supply of various controlled drugs or medicines and the possession of a controlled drug with intent to supply. He was also found guilty of one count of fraud. It took the jury less than 90 minutes to reach unanimous verdicts on the charges. Reporting restrictions were lifted after he also admitted two unrelated voyeurism offences. Judge Richardson told Metwally a prison term ""of some substance"" would be inevitable at his sentencing hearing on 20 September. Dr Kate Wood, medical director at NLGNFT, said Metwally was ""immediately excluded"" from working at the trust when the allegations came to light and reported to the General Medical Council. Chris Hartley from the Crown Prosecution Service said Metwally was a ""dangerous"" man who had ""cruelly and deliberately"" exploited Ms Wilson. ""By administering powerful anaesthetic and sedative drugs outside the safety of a hospital setting he was not only deliberately injuring Ms Wilson; he was endangering her life,"" he said.

"The fall of Zaranj will be seen as a heavy blow to Afghan government forces (pictured) A city in southwestern Afghanistan has become the first provincial capital to fall to the Taliban since the militants launched a sweeping offensive earlier this year. Local officials said the Taliban had captured Zaranj, in Nimroz province, in a major blow to government forces. The insurgents continue to make rapid advances across the country as foreign troops withdraw. They have taken swathes of countryside and are now targeting key cities. Other provincial capitals under pressure include Herat in the west, and the southern cities of Kandahar and Lashkar Gah. The UN's special envoy for Afghanistan, Deborah Lyons, on Friday said the war there had entered a ""new, deadlier, and more destructive phase"", with more than 1,000 civilians killed in the past month. She warned that the country was heading for ""catastrophe"", and called on the UN Security Council to issue an ""unambiguous statement that attacks against cities must stop now"". Later on Friday, the UK government advised all its citizens in Afghanistan to leave because of the worsening security situation. Taliban insurgents claimed victory in Zaranj - a major trading hub near the Iranian border - in a post shared on Twitter. ""This is the beginning, and see how other provinces fall in our hands very soon,"" a Taliban commander told Reuters news agency. Pictures posted on social media showed civilians looting items from government buildings. Taliban insurgents were photographed inside the local airport and posing at the entrance to the city. The militants made a sustained bid to seize the city after capturing surrounding districts. But Nimroz's Deputy Governor Roh Gul Khairzad told reporters that Zaranj had fallen ""without a fight"". She and other local officials complained of a lack of reinforcements from the Afghan government. ""The city was under threat for a while, but no one from the central government listened to us,"" Ms Khairzad said. PROFILE:Who are the Taliban? ANALYSIS:How the Taliban retook half of Afghanistan ON THE GROUND:Bodies on the streets as fighting traps Afghans The last time the Taliban captured a provincial capital was in 2016, when they briefly held the northern city of Kunduz. The militants launched a major military campaign in May, to coincide with the phased withdrawal of US and Nato forces after 20 years of military operations. The capture of Zaranj will add to their momentum, analysts say. Overnight, US and Afghan forces launched air strikes on the group's positions in Lashkar Gah, the capital of Helmand province. Government troops have vowed not to lose the strategically significant city, and fighting there has been fierce. Officials have urged civilians to evacuate, with thousands trapped or fleeing for their lives. In Herat, people have also been fleeing their homes in anticipation of a government offensive against Taliban positions. ""We have nothing left and we do not know where to go,"" one resident told AFP news agency. Earlier on Friday, the director of Afghanistan's government media centre wasassassinated by Taliban militants in the capital, Kabul. Dawa Khan Menapal was shot dead as he left a mosque in his car. The Taliban said he had been ""punished for his deeds"". Afghan government colleagues condemned the killing as shocking and cowardly. US ChargÃ© d'Affaires to Afghanistan Ross Wilson tweeted that he was ""saddened and disgusted"" by the killing, adding: ""These murders are an affront to Afghans' human rights and freedom of speech."" Days earlier, an attack on the Afghan defence minister's house in Kabul left at least eight people dead. The minister, Bismillah Khan Mohammadi, was not at home at the time. At a UN Security Council meeting on Friday, representatives voiced concerns over the growing bloodshed. Afghanistan's envoy Ghulam Isaczai called on the Security Council to take action to pressure the militants to halt their attacks and take part in meaningful peace talks. ""It is our collective responsibility to stop them from destroying Afghanistan and threatening the world community,"" he said. Meanwhile, the chair of the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission told the BBC that countries within the region in particular needed to tell the Taliban that coming to power through violence would mean that their government would not be recognised.

"Younger doctors have witnessed unvaccinated patients in their 20s and 30s becoming severely ill with Covid-19 Young doctors who have witnessed severe Covid illness in patients their own age have urged young Scots to get vaccinated. Six medics in their 20s and 30s have written an open letter appealing to young people to take up their jabs and reject misinformation on social media. Latest stats show 72.8% of 18-29 year-olds had had a first dose, while it was 81% among people in their 30s. Ninety-one people aged 20-39 were in hospital last Monday with Covid-19. Dr Adelina McLeod, a trainee physician in Edinburgh, has put her name to the plea. Are young people slowing the vaccine drive? Thousands of teenagers to get jab before school return She told BBC Scotland News: ""We are still seeing patients of all ages admitted with coronavirus and it is particularly difficult when you see peers the same age as you becoming significantly unwell with the virus. ""To be honest I feel quite anxious for them. Everybody thinks it is not going to happen to them until it does and that is my experience with people I have treated. ""They underestimated how significant this could be."" Dr Adelina McLeod says she feels ""anxious"" for young people who are unvaccinated The letter begins: ""We would all love the Covid-19 pandemic to be over, but unfortunately, it's not."" It continues: ""As young medics in our 20s and 30s, we are very concerned to witness this happening to people our age. It all seems so unnecessary."" They said that the best way out of the pandemic and getting back to normal was through vaccination. And it addressed concerns over potential side-effects. ""There's a lot of misinformation on social media at the moment and that leads to mistrust,"" they wrote. ""But side effects are normally very mild - symptoms like a sore head, a sore arm, or tiredness normally last for just a couple of days. ""That's better than the symptoms of Covid-19 itself, or long Covid - which can go on for months and be much worse."" Sarah Cooper said there was nothing a health professional could say to convince her to get the vaccine Sarah Cooper, 27, has not taken up her offer of the Covid vaccine. She says she is not against the vaccine - it's just ""not for me"". She told BBC Scotland News her grandmother, who has the respiratory disease COPD was gravely ill with Covid, and she understands how severe it can be, but she does not feel it is necessary for her to get it. The mother-of-one from Paisley said: ""If I was older I might have had a different view. I don't get the flu jab every year. I have been lucky enough not to have Covid but other family members have. ""My partner and all my family have had the vaccine. But I have given it a lot of thought and feel the government is putting a lot of pressure on getting it and that tends to put me off more."" She added: ""I don't think there is any amount of evidence or trials that could persuade me and everybody's body reacts differently. It's more my fears of something I could get. And they might never reverse any damage it does to my body. ""It's my body and my choice. I just want people to know I have experienced coronavirus, I don't believe I am being selfish. I do believe the vaccination will help people but I just believe it is not right for me."" The group of doctors, which included GP and surgical trainees, extended their vaccination plea to 16 and 17-year-olds and pregnant women. About one in 10 pregnant women admitted to hospital with Covid-19 requires intensive care and one in five gives birth prematurely, they said, citing data from the University of Oxford. The letter adds: ""Like many of you, younger medics are tired of the pandemic. But we must keep fighting on. ""The quicker that everyone is vaccinated, the quicker we can get back to a normal life; to doing the things that we all love."" The plea was endorsed by Scottish Academy of Medical Royal Colleges and Faculties (SAMRCF) chairman Dr Miles Mack, who said: ""Speaking to medical trainees, it struck me that they are troubled and concerned that very sick people in their age group are being admitted to hospital with Covid-19. ""I plead with people to listen to these young medics. ""They have been on the front line of the pandemic. They have seen the serious illness that Covid-19 can cause in people of all ages. ""Please follow the young medics' advice and get vaccinated as soon as possible."" We want to hear from young people about their views on vaccination. Are you aged 18-39? Have you had a Covid vaccine? Or have you decided not to get it? Please share your stories and pictures with us.

Speaking to BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotland programme, Dr Mack said that because the new variant of Covid was more infectious, the level of herd immunity needed had ""increased"". He said: ""The effects on younger people seems to be more with the new variant so whatever level [of herd immunity], we just need to make sure it's as good as it possibly can be. ""The exact level is difficult and part of that problem is because of the age stratification - the younger people are very socially active, they're out working, socialising, so even if there is this cohort that aren't vaccinated it's going to leave a significant pool of infection and it's going to be there long term. ""That's even beyond awareness with children - we will probably expect coronavirus to become an endemic infection of childhood in the longer term, so vaccination is going to continue to be really important."" Other signatories to the letter are: Dr Mohamed Elseedawy, a trainee GP, Dr Jennie Cathcart, a trainee physician in Glasgow, Dr Francis Robertson, a surgical trainee in Edinburgh, Dr Eireann Allen representing the Scottish Academy trainee doctors group and Dr Manveer Rahi, a trainee physician in Edinburgh.

"Boris Johnson has declined to apologise amid a backlash over his remarks about coal mine closures under former premier Margaret Thatcher. The PM has faced demands to say sorry after claiming the shutdowns in the 1980s gave the UK a ""big early start"" in fighting climate change. Opposition MPs have called the comments offensive to former mining communities. The PM's spokesman said he recognises the ""huge impact and pain"" of closures, but did not offer an apology. Visiting a Scottish wind farm on Thursday, Mr Johnson told reporters: ""Thanks to Margaret Thatcher, who closed so many coal mines across the country, we had a big early start and we're now moving rapidly away from coal altogether."" He is reported to have laughed and added: ""I thought that would get you going."" Why mining gaffe will linger after PM's Scottish visit Why the battle for British coal matters to the world PM's coal mines 'joke' no laughing matter, say MPs Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said Mr Johnson's remarks were ""crass and deeply insensitive"" to mining communities. She tweeted: ""Lives and communities in Scotland were utterly devastated by Thatcher's destruction of the coal industry (which had zero to do with any concern she had for the planet)."" Labour's shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy had called for an apology on Thursday, calling the PM's comments ""shameful"". This video can not be played Former miner reacts to Johnson's coal mine comments Asked on Friday if the PM would be apologising, his official spokesman said: ""The prime minister recognises the huge impact and pain closing coal mines had in communities across the UK. ""This government has an ambitious plan to tackle the critical issue of climate change, which includes reducing reliance on coal and other non-renewable energy sources."" Shortly afterwards, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer issued a statement repeating the party's demands for an apology, adding the remarks had shown Mr Johnson's ""true colours"". ""For Boris Johnson to laugh when talking about the closure of the coal mines is a slap in the face for communities still suffering from the devastating effects of Margaret Thatcher's callous actions,"" he added. In 1984, there were 170 working collieries in Britain, employing more than 190,000 people - but by 2015, they had all closed. Mrs Thatcher's announcement that she planned to close 20 of them, led to the year-long miners' dispute. Millions of people protested against pit closures and throughout the summer of 1984 there were violent clashes between striking miners and police, whose numbers often ran into several hundred at each confrontation. Violence led to widespread use of the breach of the peace charge. In October, it was announced that minersconvicted during the strike would be pardonedby the Scottish government following an independent review. Grahame Morris, Labour MP for the former County Durham mining community of Easington, said: ""Pushing Thatcher as some sort of eco-warrior for closing coal mines is a rewriting of history."" ""Closing coal mines had nothing to do with saving the environment,"" he added. ""It was an assault on a way of life, on trade unions and on communities that did not fit with Thatcher's free market brand of conservatism."" Police restrain picketers outside a pit during the miners' strike in the 1980s Tory MP Brendan Clarke-Smith, who represents the former coal mining area of Bassetlaw, said the PM's remark had ""clearly been made in jest"" and was ""said in the context of the move away from fossil fuels"". ""That said, I wouldn't have made the joke myself, and I think we all know that when an industry closes down in a community it can have a hugely detrimental effect on the local economy,"" he said. He added he found it ""remarkable"" that ""the same people"" criticising the PM were also ""expecting everybody to cut out fossil fuels immediately and drive electric cars"", adding: ""They can't have it both ways."" Labour is opposed to the opening of new coal mines, saying they are not compatible with the UK wanting to be a world leader in reducing carbon emissions. But Labour's Alex Davies-Jones, who represents a former coalmining seat in south Wales, said closures had wrought long-lasting economic damage on such areas and Mr Johnson's remarks were ""appalling"".

"Sixteen and 17-year-olds across the UK are now being invited to book their Covid vaccine. GPs in England have been told they can contact this age group, while invites are also being sent out in Wales. In Northern Ireland, walk-in centres are now open to older teenagers, and in Scotland they can register their interest online. Meanwhile, new figures show most patients in hospital with Covid in England continue to be unvaccinated. Children aged 12 to 17 who are at higher risk of getting ill if they catch Covid - or live with people who have a weak immune system - have already been able to get vaccinated. In England 240,870 under-18s had received a first dose by 1 August. The opening of vaccinations to all 16 and 17-year-olds in England comes amid a drive to encourage young people to get jabbed. The vaccine's benefits will be promoted to partygoers in nightclubs, including Ministry of Sound and Heaven. A campaign will also be rolled out across social media channels including Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat and TikTok, as well as on radio stations Kiss, Capital, Heart, Sunrise, and TalkSport, urging young adults to get jabbed. Walk-in centres in England will begin accepting people aged 16 and 17 from next week, but those in that age group are currently unable to book an appointment using the NHS website. Fifth of England Covid hospital cases aged 18-34 Infections and hospital cases down - is Covid over? How many people have been vaccinated so far? In Northern Ireland people aged 16 and up have begun to get the vaccine. Elliot Aston, 16, from Newtownards told the PA News Agency it was good his age group was able to get the jab as ""we are probably the ones that are out and about the most"". Bethany Holden, 16, who was among the first to receive the vaccine at the SSE Arena in Belfast on Friday, said she was glad to get the jab as she was ""more protected and protecting other people as well"". Bethany Holden said she got the vaccine to protect herself and others Children aged 12 to 15 who are clinically vulnerable to Covid or live with adults who are at increased risk of serious illness from the virus will be contacted by the NHS and invited for their vaccine over the coming weeks, NHS England said. Jabs will also be offered to children aged 12 years and over who live with someone who is immunosuppressed, such as those receiving chemotherapy or who have had a transplant, with NHS England saying more than a million children and young people could now get the jab. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the vaccines were ""building a wall of defence against the virus"" and were ""the best way to protect people from serious illness"". Since 19 July, 1,467 people have been admitted to hospital with cases of the Delta variant, Public Health England (PHE) said. Out of these 808 (55.1%) were unvaccinated, while 512 (34.9%) had received both doses. PHE said: ""While vaccines provide high levels of protection, they are not 100% effective and will not stop everyone catching Covid-19. ""As more of the population gets vaccinated, we will see a higher relative percentage of vaccinated people in hospital."" Dr Jenny Harries, chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency, stressed vaccines would not eliminate all risk and it was still possible to become unwell with Covid-19 and infect others. ""It is still vital that we exercise caution, particularly while cases are high,"" she added. Some 88.8% of the UK's adult population have now had one dose of a coronavirus vaccine, while 73.8% have had both jabs. Delta remains the dominant variant in the UK, making up about 99% of cases. The brunt of Covid in the UK is clearly being born by the unvaccinated. Only one in ten adults have now not had a single dose of the vaccine, and children rarely become severely ill. So it is hugely telling when more than half of those in hospital are from the unvaccinated minority. But this shouldn't be a surprise. The latest estimate by the UK's Vaccine Effectiveness Expert Panel says two doses cuts the chance of you needing hospital treatment by 95% if you catch Delta. That's not perfect, vaccines aren't an impenetrable shield; and yes there are still people in hospital who had both jabs. But the way vaccines are rapidly transforming the pandemic - at least in wealthier countries - is incredible. On Friday 31,808 new cases of Covid werereported across the UK,externalalong with a further 92 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Prof Sir Ian Diamond, the UK's national statistician, told the BBC the UK was seeing evidence of a decline in Covid infections across the country. He said rates were still relatively high in many areas, but he expected to see a ""continued decline"" over the next four or five weeks. He warned that he did not think ""we're in a position to say we have reached the end of Covid"" and said people should not stop showing a degree of caution. The R number - which represents the average number of people one infected person will pass the virus on to - has also fallen in England to between 0.8 and 1.1,according to the latest government figures,external. Last week it was estimated as between 1.1 and 1.4. When the R number is above one, the number of cases keeps increasing. INSTATRADERS:Is foreign exchange trading a trustworthy route to extra cash?

"The fall of Zaranj will be seen as a heavy blow to Afghan government forces (pictured) A city in southwestern Afghanistan has become the first provincial capital to fall to the Taliban since the militants launched a sweeping offensive earlier this year. Local officials said the Taliban had captured Zaranj, in Nimroz province, in a major blow to government forces. The insurgents continue to make rapid advances across the country as foreign troops withdraw. They have taken swathes of countryside and are now targeting key cities. Other provincial capitals under pressure include Herat in the west, and the southern cities of Kandahar and Lashkar Gah. The UN's special envoy for Afghanistan, Deborah Lyons, on Friday said the war there had entered a ""new, deadlier, and more destructive phase"", with more than 1,000 civilians killed in the past month. She warned that the country was heading for ""catastrophe"", and called on the UN Security Council to issue an ""unambiguous statement that attacks against cities must stop now"". Later on Friday, the UK government advised all its citizens in Afghanistan to leave because of the worsening security situation. Taliban insurgents claimed victory in Zaranj - a major trading hub near the Iranian border - in a post shared on Twitter. ""This is the beginning, and see how other provinces fall in our hands very soon,"" a Taliban commander told Reuters news agency. Pictures posted on social media showed civilians looting items from government buildings. Taliban insurgents were photographed inside the local airport and posing at the entrance to the city. The militants made a sustained bid to seize the city after capturing surrounding districts. But Nimroz's Deputy Governor Roh Gul Khairzad told reporters that Zaranj had fallen ""without a fight"". She and other local officials complained of a lack of reinforcements from the Afghan government. ""The city was under threat for a while, but no one from the central government listened to us,"" Ms Khairzad said. PROFILE:Who are the Taliban? ANALYSIS:How the Taliban retook half of Afghanistan ON THE GROUND:Bodies on the streets as fighting traps Afghans The last time the Taliban captured a provincial capital was in 2016, when they briefly held the northern city of Kunduz. The militants launched a major military campaign in May, to coincide with the phased withdrawal of US and Nato forces after 20 years of military operations. The capture of Zaranj will add to their momentum, analysts say. Overnight, US and Afghan forces launched air strikes on the group's positions in Lashkar Gah, the capital of Helmand province. Government troops have vowed not to lose the strategically significant city, and fighting there has been fierce. Officials have urged civilians to evacuate, with thousands trapped or fleeing for their lives. In Herat, people have also been fleeing their homes in anticipation of a government offensive against Taliban positions. ""We have nothing left and we do not know where to go,"" one resident told AFP news agency. Earlier on Friday, the director of Afghanistan's government media centre wasassassinated by Taliban militants in the capital, Kabul. Dawa Khan Menapal was shot dead as he left a mosque in his car. The Taliban said he had been ""punished for his deeds"". Afghan government colleagues condemned the killing as shocking and cowardly. US ChargÃ© d'Affaires to Afghanistan Ross Wilson tweeted that he was ""saddened and disgusted"" by the killing, adding: ""These murders are an affront to Afghans' human rights and freedom of speech."" Days earlier, an attack on the Afghan defence minister's house in Kabul left at least eight people dead. The minister, Bismillah Khan Mohammadi, was not at home at the time. At a UN Security Council meeting on Friday, representatives voiced concerns over the growing bloodshed. Afghanistan's envoy Ghulam Isaczai called on the Security Council to take action to pressure the militants to halt their attacks and take part in meaningful peace talks. ""It is our collective responsibility to stop them from destroying Afghanistan and threatening the world community,"" he said. Meanwhile, the chair of the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission told the BBC that countries within the region in particular needed to tell the Taliban that coming to power through violence would mean that their government would not be recognised.

"Although the trees are being planted to offset carbon emissions, there are concerns the loss of farmland harms rural communities Plans to encourage more trees to be planted in Wales are under fire for ""destroying communities"" in rural areas. Large-scale investment companies have been buying farms across the country for afforestation - planting trees to offset carbon emissions. But there are concerns it could damage local culture, language and heritage. The Welsh government said it would launch a consultation on its National Forest plan. About 12 farms have been sold recently in mid Wales by companies outside the country, according to an agricultural expert. Largest trees planted to offset lifetime emissions 'Disappointing' tree planting as Wales lags behind Wales' woodlands 'facing catastrophe' Wales hasdeclared a climate emergencyand pledged to be at least95% carbon neutral by 2050. The Welsh government last yearlaunched a plan to create a National Forest for Wales, promising to increase the number of trees being planted every year to improve air quality and reduce greenhouse gases. The policy aimed to ""create woodlands that are accessible to people and give local communities the opportunity to get involved, helping to promote Welsh language, culture and heritage"". But there are calls to make urgent changes to the strategy, which currently allows companies outside Wales to take advantage of forestry grants. After living on a farm for nearly 70 years, John Thomas hoped it would be passed on to future generations of farmers - but it was resold to a company in London After living and working on Frongoch Farm in Carmarthenshire's Cothi Valley for nearly 70 years, it was a wrench for John Thomas to sell the farm when he retired three years ago. He hoped the new owners would take care of his family home in Cwrt y Cadno and safeguard it for future generations of farmers. But it was resold earlier this year to a multi-national investment company called Foresight Group, based at the Shard in London. At auction, the guide price was exceeded and the farm, together with another local holding, sold for more than Â£2m. Mr Thomas said it was ""breaking my heart"" to see his childhood home become one of many sold to ""huge, faceless companies in England"" for planting trees. ""I feel very sad about it - I feel quite angry actually,"" he said. ""It shouldn't be allowed to happen on such a big scale. It's shameful that they should be allowed to do this. ""They're sacrificing Welsh land for the benefit of the rich in England."" New targets on Wales' climate change gases UK commits to 'net zero' emissions by 2050 Wales must prepare for 'hotter, wetter future' The Foresight Group owns four farms in Wales - Frongoch, Brynglas, Esgair Hir and Banc - and confirmed that it intended to use the land for afforestation. The company said: ""Sustainability is central to Foresight's business and we believe it is right to invest responsibly in forestry sites around the UK. ""A key focus of our approach is to ensure that any land use change is done in as sensitive way as possible. As part of any new scheme, we always engage and consult with local communities."" The company added it targeted less fertile land for afforestation projects and confirmed it intended to apply for Welsh government grants. Susan Price was raised on a farm near Llanwrtyd Wells and says she feels bitter that the land has been sold to companies outside Wales Susan Price, who lives on a farm near Llanwrtyd Wells in Powys, said there were three farms in the area which had been recently sold to companies from outside Wales to plant trees. She said taking fertile land out of food production into forestry was harmful for the local agricultural industry and damaged the local culture and language. ""I feel quite bitter because it's part of our heritage,"" added Ms Price. ""When our livelihoods are taken away from us, then our heritage and our communities and our language disappear and I think it's very sad. She said large companies bought land as investment, ""outpricing local families"", and the Welsh government was ""making it so easy for them"" through its grant system. ""I don't suppose you can blame them - it's here for them on a plate and they're going to take it up, but unfortunately, we have to lose things because of it,"" she said. Agricultural consultant Dai Dyer has been researching the buying and selling of farms and says urgent action is needed by the Welsh government Dai Dyer, an agricultural consultant in the Tywi Valley, Carmarthenshire, has researched the buying and selling of farms in mid and south-west Wales. He warned the buying up of farms for tree planting became ""a trend that might not be able to be stopped"", turning ""fruitful, productive farms that also house families"" into ""a house surrounded by trees"". He added the grant scheme should only be offered to those living in Wales and the amount of planting on anyone holding restricted to 10%. The Welsh government said: ""The Woodland Investment Grant Scheme is not a land purchase scheme. ""It is unlikely investors buying land for planting trees on a large scale will apply to the scheme, unless they are aiming to create a woodland area for local communities."" The Welsh government added a formal consultation on the National Forest scheme would be launched shortly to engage with local communities and farmers.

"Another woman has been sexually harassed in hotel quarantine despite new rules designed to prevent it. Last month the government said female guests would get female guards. However, Lorna Farmer, 28, walked out of the Hilton Garden Inn at Birmingham airport a week ago, after a guard offered to ""entertain"" her in her room. The Department of Health and Social Care now says it will introduce a new phone line for women to report harassment confidentially. Eighteen women have now reported harassment to the BBC - two of them since the DHSC took steps to fix the problem in July. The new measures included a new dedicated complaints system and extra training for guards on how to behave around lone women, as well as the plan for women to be supervised by female guards ""when available"". Lorna Farmer says, however, that she was only escorted outside on exercise breaks by male guards. She says she began receiving unwanted attention from a security guard employed by the company, Mitie, soon after arriving at the Hilton Garden Inn on Sunday 25 July. He asked to see her in her pyjamas, and asked to enter her room, she says - knocking repeatedly on her door and sometimes sitting on the floor outside it. Travellers arriving from countries on the UK's red list have to quarantine for 10 full days in designated hotels Nearly 124,000 people had been through the system by mid-July The cost is Â£1,750 for a single adult,rising to Â£2,285 on 12 August,external, and includes Covid tests on days two and eight Guests must stay in their room at all times except when escorted outside by guards for exercise - food is delivered to the room and guests do their own cleaning Security companies are hired by the government - the maximum value of Mitie's contract from February to October is Â£19.6m, the maximum value of G4s's is Â£66.5m What are the rules for travelling to green, amber and red-list countries? On one occasion, when she was cleaning her room, he said: ""Why don't you put that Hoover down and I'll come in and entertain you."" Ms Farmer says he repeated this another five times within the space of 10 minutes. When she complained to the head of the security team in the hotel, from the company Mitie, the guard was removed. But Ms Farmer says a different guard had also made lewd comments to female guests during their exercise break, so she still felt unsafe and got her father to come and drive her home. She then reported the harassment to police in Northamptonshire, where she is from. Mitie said: ""Should a complaint be raised by a guest a full investigation is carried out. In this case, the investigation found that the officer had not followed our procedures and therefore is no longer working on the contract."" Asked whether he was still working for Mitie, and whether he might now be working at a different quarantine hotel, a spokesperson said she could not share personal information about staff. Lorna Farmer's first quarantine hotel, the Hilton Garden Inn at Birmingham airport The Hilton Garden Inn emphasised that security firms were contracted by the DHSC and fell outside its responsibility. The DHSC said: ""Sexual harassment or abuse is completely unacceptable and totally abhorrent. We take all such allegations extremely seriously and we expect providers to take firm action - including suspending staff or reporting them to the police where appropriate - as has happened in this case."" It said the new confidential reporting line for lone female guests would be staffed by recently retired and trained police officers. Another woman, who is still in quarantine, says that a male security guard knocked on her door twice in one evening, giving a transparently bogus reason for wanting to talk to her. She said she was not reporting the incident because she felt unsafe and was not leaving her room. Women say they were sexually harassed by guards Women in hotel quarantine to get female guards Ms Farmer told the BBC that when she went outside for exercise at the Hilton Garden Inn, she was always escorted by a single male guard, despite the DHSC's intention that lone female guests should get female guards. Three other women quarantining since the rule change have told the BBC that they too had male guards. Others have said that they have mostly had female guards, though one added that ""once you're outside it's like being a walking exhibit with male guards sitting all around the parking lot like it's a gallery and looking you up and down as you walk"". In July, the government said that if female guards were unavailable, lone women should be escorted by two male guards, ""with each guard chaperoning the other to ensure appropriate behaviour"". This idea was sharply criticised by some women's safety campaigners and, judging from the reports of women in quarantine, appears to have been rarely adopted in practice. Lorna Farmer's second quarantine hotel, the Crowne Plaza NEC After walking out of the Hilton Garden Inn on Friday and spending the weekend at home, Lorna Farmer was called on Tuesday by an official who told her that West Midlands Police were looking for her, and that she could be arrested and fined Â£10,000 if she didn't return to quarantine. She says she felt very uneasy when two men then arrived in a van with darkened windows to accompany her to another quarantine hotel, the Crowne Plaza NEC. Here she was escorted outside for exercise by a female security guard, but says she only saw male guards on her corridor. Mitie says there was a female guard on her floor at all times, and that at least two female officers were always on shift at each hotel, in line with DHSC guidance. The company added that it was taking active steps to increase the number of female officers working in quarantine hotels. According to the Security Industry Authority only 10% of licenced security guards in the UK are women. Carry a door wedgeor jammer in case your door doesn't have a second lock. These should prevent anyone entering, even if they have a master key. Always use the peep hole or door chain before opening the door to anybody. Identify the security companyat your quarantine hotel and find emergency contact details - eg whistleblower numbers on their website. Note names, ID numbers or identifying features of anyone harassing you. Save notes and approaches via social media. Report the incident if and when you feel safe to do so. Be an allyif you see others being harassed. This may include recording the incident, taking notes, asking if the victim needs help, calling out the bad behaviour or reporting it. Speak to a loved one- when you're afraid, you may be less able to process events logically. A loved one may help you assess the situation and decide on the safest course of action, which may be to call the emergency services. Carolyn Pearson, founder of Maiden-Voyage.com Ms Farmer says she thinks it is ""ridiculous"" for lone women to be forced to quarantine in hotels when their safety cannot be guaranteed. ""The woman from public health said, 'Lorna, are you aware that West Midlands Police are looking for you, that they've put you down as absconded?' I was like, 'No, I spoke to Northamptonshire Police and reported everything that's happened, and they are absolutely happy with me being home.' ""And she was like, 'You have to come back today, otherwise we will come and get you and you'll be prosecuted and fined.' And I was like, 'Are you serious? After everything that's happened?'"" Ms Farmer was allowed to leave the hotel on Thursday, 11 days after she arrived in the UK from Dubai. West Midlands Victims' Commissioner Nicky Brennan said she was ""disgusted"" to hear how women were being treated by security staff in quarantine hotels. ""The government who have given the contract and the security company need to investigate the practices, training and conduct of staff with urgency. People who are quarantining in hotels at the orders of the government should not have to feel unsafe when following those rules. ""This would appear to be a problem across the country with security staff in these hotels. It's worrying for anybody, especially lone women that they could be treated in this way. They should not be put in this position by a government which is meant to be keeping them safe.""

Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the vaccines were ""building a wall of defence against the virus"" and were ""the best way to protect people from serious illness"". Since 19 July, 1,467 people have been admitted to hospital with cases of the Delta variant, Public Health England (PHE) said. Out of these 808 (55.1%) were unvaccinated, while 512 (34.9%) had received both doses. PHE said: ""While vaccines provide high levels of protection, they are not 100% effective and will not stop everyone catching Covid-19. ""As more of the population gets vaccinated, we will see a higher relative percentage of vaccinated people in hospital."" Dr Jenny Harries, chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency, stressed vaccines would not eliminate all risk and it was still possible to become unwell with Covid-19 and infect others. ""It is still vital that we exercise caution, particularly while cases are high,"" she added. Some 88.8% of the UK's adult population have now had one dose of a coronavirus vaccine, while 73.8% have had both jabs. Delta remains the dominant variant in the UK, making up about 99% of cases. The brunt of Covid in the UK is clearly being born by the unvaccinated. Only one in ten adults have now not had a single dose of the vaccine, and children rarely become severely ill. So it is hugely telling when more than half of those in hospital are from the unvaccinated minority. But this shouldn't be a surprise. The latest estimate by the UK's Vaccine Effectiveness Expert Panel says two doses cuts the chance of you needing hospital treatment by 95% if you catch Delta. That's not perfect, vaccines aren't an impenetrable shield; and yes there are still people in hospital who had both jabs. But the way vaccines are rapidly transforming the pandemic - at least in wealthier countries - is incredible. On Friday 31,808 new cases of Covid werereported across the UK,externalalong with a further 92 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Prof Sir Ian Diamond, the UK's national statistician, told the BBC the UK was seeing evidence of a decline in Covid infections across the country. He said rates were still relatively high in many areas, but he expected to see a ""continued decline"" over the next four or five weeks. He warned that he did not think ""we're in a position to say we have reached the end of Covid"" and said people should not stop showing a degree of caution. The R number - which represents the average number of people one infected person will pass the virus on to - has also fallen in England to between 0.8 and 1.1,according to the latest government figures,external. Last week it was estimated as between 1.1 and 1.4. When the R number is above one, the number of cases keeps increasing. INSTATRADERS:Is foreign exchange trading a trustworthy route to extra cash?

"The fall of Zaranj will be seen as a heavy blow to Afghan government forces (pictured) A city in southwestern Afghanistan has become the first provincial capital to fall to the Taliban since the militants launched a sweeping offensive earlier this year. Local officials said the Taliban had captured Zaranj, in Nimroz province, in a major blow to government forces. The insurgents continue to make rapid advances across the country as foreign troops withdraw. They have taken swathes of countryside and are now targeting key cities. Other provincial capitals under pressure include Herat in the west, and the southern cities of Kandahar and Lashkar Gah. The UN's special envoy for Afghanistan, Deborah Lyons, on Friday said the war there had entered a ""new, deadlier, and more destructive phase"", with more than 1,000 civilians killed in the past month. She warned that the country was heading for ""catastrophe"", and called on the UN Security Council to issue an ""unambiguous statement that attacks against cities must stop now"". Later on Friday, the UK government advised all its citizens in Afghanistan to leave because of the worsening security situation. Taliban insurgents claimed victory in Zaranj - a major trading hub near the Iranian border - in a post shared on Twitter. ""This is the beginning, and see how other provinces fall in our hands very soon,"" a Taliban commander told Reuters news agency. Pictures posted on social media showed civilians looting items from government buildings. Taliban insurgents were photographed inside the local airport and posing at the entrance to the city. The militants made a sustained bid to seize the city after capturing surrounding districts. But Nimroz's Deputy Governor Roh Gul Khairzad told reporters that Zaranj had fallen ""without a fight"". She and other local officials complained of a lack of reinforcements from the Afghan government. ""The city was under threat for a while, but no one from the central government listened to us,"" Ms Khairzad said. PROFILE:Who are the Taliban? ANALYSIS:How the Taliban retook half of Afghanistan ON THE GROUND:Bodies on the streets as fighting traps Afghans The last time the Taliban captured a provincial capital was in 2016, when they briefly held the northern city of Kunduz. The militants launched a major military campaign in May, to coincide with the phased withdrawal of US and Nato forces after 20 years of military operations. The capture of Zaranj will add to their momentum, analysts say. Overnight, US and Afghan forces launched air strikes on the group's positions in Lashkar Gah, the capital of Helmand province. Government troops have vowed not to lose the strategically significant city, and fighting there has been fierce. Officials have urged civilians to evacuate, with thousands trapped or fleeing for their lives. In Herat, people have also been fleeing their homes in anticipation of a government offensive against Taliban positions. ""We have nothing left and we do not know where to go,"" one resident told AFP news agency. Earlier on Friday, the director of Afghanistan's government media centre wasassassinated by Taliban militants in the capital, Kabul. Dawa Khan Menapal was shot dead as he left a mosque in his car. The Taliban said he had been ""punished for his deeds"". Afghan government colleagues condemned the killing as shocking and cowardly. US ChargÃ© d'Affaires to Afghanistan Ross Wilson tweeted that he was ""saddened and disgusted"" by the killing, adding: ""These murders are an affront to Afghans' human rights and freedom of speech."" Days earlier, an attack on the Afghan defence minister's house in Kabul left at least eight people dead. The minister, Bismillah Khan Mohammadi, was not at home at the time. At a UN Security Council meeting on Friday, representatives voiced concerns over the growing bloodshed. Afghanistan's envoy Ghulam Isaczai called on the Security Council to take action to pressure the militants to halt their attacks and take part in meaningful peace talks. ""It is our collective responsibility to stop them from destroying Afghanistan and threatening the world community,"" he said. Meanwhile, the chair of the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission told the BBC that countries within the region in particular needed to tell the Taliban that coming to power through violence would mean that their government would not be recognised.

"Energy prices will rise for millions of people across the UK in October, right at the start of the cold weather. Regulator Ofgem said the price cap for default domestic energy deals would be raised to cover suppliers' extra costs. The typical gas and electricity customer is likely to see their bill go up by Â£139 to Â£1,277 a year. Charities warned the timing would hit struggling families hard, who already face losing an extra Â£20 a week from Universal Credit in October. Prepayment customers will see an increase of Â£153, from Â£1,156 to Â£1309, the regulator said. Ofgem chief executive Jonathan Brearley told the BBC: ""The reason the price cap is going up is there has been a record increase in energy prices across the board, not just in gas and electricity but in petrol and diesel."" He urged customers to shop around for the best tariffs, saying there were big savings to be made by switching. ""You don't have to live with this tariff. The price cap is a backstop. We'd encourage any customer, particularly those struggling to pay their bills, to contact their supplier, and get access to a wide-range of help and support,"" he said. ""This is a devastating increase,"" said Peter Smith, director of policy and advocacy at fuel poverty charity National Energy Action. ""Millions of household budgets are already stretched to the limit and this massive increase could not be coming at a worse time."" How does the energy price cap affect my bill? Charities say energy choice needed in poorer homes Inaccurate gas and electricity bills criticised Energy prices to rise for millions of households Ofgem said rising wholesale costs were behind the increase, adding that the existence of the price cap meant households would save between Â£75-Â£100 a year. The watchdog also pointed out energy users could switch to a better deal to save up to Â£200. However, the Resolution Foundation says policymakers need to do more to help families who are close to the poverty line. Jonathan Marshall, senior economist, said the government must focus on widening the current warm homes discount scheme, as well as reversing the planned removal of the Â£20 Universal Credit uplift. There should also be more targeted support for families at risk of falling into fuel poverty. ""A rise in in energy prices will disproportionately impact those who are already struggling,"" said Mr Marshall. Domestic energy bills are linked to wholesale prices, which have gone up this year The price cap, set twice a year by the regulator, affects 11 million households in England, Wales and Scotland who have never switched suppliers or whose discounted deals have expired. Northern Ireland sets its own cap. That accounts for about half of all UK households. The remainder are on so-called fixed deals, which will not be affected. Around four million prepayment meter customers will also be affected. The cap sets the prices that suppliers can charge for each unit of energy, but that does not mean there is a limit to how much people can pay. The more gas and electricity you use, the higher the bill. ""Finding an extra Â£20 a month for energy bills will leave me with a stark choice of paying for either food or fuel,"" says Anthony Lyman of Northampton. The 35-year-old autistic single father of two adds: ""We may have to have a cold house to have a full belly."" Anthony lost his job at a special needs school through ill-health at the start of the pandemic and has since been relying on Universal Credit and help with managing his finances from debt charity Christians Against Poverty, as well as being forced to turn to food banks. ""We've been relying on the Universal Credit uplift money to get by but the prospect of losing that Â£20 a week in October and having to pay more for gas and electricity will leave me on a financial knife-edge."" The energy industry has said there's plenty of help for vulnerable people like Anthony but he says in practice it's almost impossible to get it. ""We haven't been able to get in touch with anybody from our suppliers during the pandemic. You can only seem to talk to a computer and it's very difficult to tell a computer I'm struggling."" How will a rise in energy prices affect you?haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. Please include a contact number if you are willing to speak to a BBC journalist.

Wholesale prices have risen after gas prices soared to a record high as many economies recovered strongly from the Covid-19 crisis, prompting a surge in demand for energy. When wholesale prices fell last summer following the first lockdown, Ofgem reduced the level of the cap by Â£84 for last winter. But in February it increased the cap by Â£96 as wholesale costs rose. Since then the wholesale cost of energy - which account for 40% of domestic bills - has climbed by more than 50%, which has led to the latest increase. EDF, one of the UK's biggest energy providers, said the ""unprecedented rate"" at which wholesale prices were rising meant that customers would ""at some point see the impact of this global trend"". A spokesman said: ""We know this will be worrying news for customers of all suppliers - we will be directing financial assistance to those most in need through a Â£1.9m support fund, helping customers reduce their bills, manage their debt and even helping with costs for things like more energy efficient white goods."" The industry's trade body, Energy UK, said people worried about their bills should ""pick up the phone and talk to your supplier"". Chief executive Emma Pinchbeck told the BBC's Today radio programme: ""There's help and assistance available, particularly for those that are vulnerable and fuel poor."" She also urged people to consider switching supplier, calling it a ""straightforward"" process. The government also advised people to shop around for the cheapest tariffs, adding that it had simplified the process. A spokesperson for the Business Department said: ""To help consumers further, we plan to trial automatic switching for customers on expensive default tariffs to cheaper deals, and are extending the Warm Home Discount so an extra 750,000 households get Â£150 knocked off their bill each year."" When the energy price cap was introduced three years ago, it was hailed as a shield for customers against unscrupulous energy companies charging sky-high prices. But this October, the cap will rise to its highest ever level, so is it working? The cap applies to a company's default tariff, impacting people who never or rarely change their deal, and also those on pre-payment meters who often have less choice. While it restricted expensive prices at some companies, there have been accusations that the cap gave other firms an excuse to raise their prices up to same level as the cap. When fixing the cap point, the regulator says it must consider the wholesale price of gas and electricity so that companies can still make a profit. That's what they describe as setting a fair price. The result is that we've seen more standardised pricing across energy companies at those top rates, but not necessarily a market that's cheaper for most customers. With many people continuing to work from home through the autumn and winter months, and other budgets already being stretched with reductions to Universal Credit, this big jump in utility bills will be an unwelcome extra pressure. Fuel poverty charities are calling on Ofgem to provide deeper protection for the most vulnerable customers Energy users on variable tariffs could move to a different cheaper deal with their existing supplier or switch to another one to save up to hundreds of pounds. Switching online is relatively simple: just use an energy comparison site and all you'll need is your postcode, the name of your current supplier, and the name of your current tariff. But some vulnerable people may not be able to switch, warns National Energy Action. ""For some customers, switching is impossible due to levels of debt, or because pre-pay customers have far fewer options to switch supplier or tariff,"" added Mr Smith. The charity has called on Ofgem to provide deeper protection for the most vulnerable customers. ""The UK government can also directly help reduce energy arrears as well as maintaining investment to reduce needless energy waste in our homes,"" he said. Energy users can save hundreds by switching to a lower-priced fixed deal. All suppliers have fixed-rate deals, so the simplest way to save is to contact your existing supplier and ask to be moved to its lowest-priced fixed deal. But you could probably save more by switching to a rival, Ofgem says. It's simple to switch using an energy comparison site - all you'll need is your postcode, the name of your current supplier, and the name of your current tariff. Citizens Advice has a useful guide,externalto choosing the right tariff. Ofgem alsosets out the steps you should take to switch energy supplier,externaland shop for a better deal.

"Supermarket chain Morrisons says it has agreed to a revised takeover offer worth Â£6.7bn, up from Â£6.3bn, from a private equity consortium led by Fortress Investment Group. The increased offer, worth 272p a share, comes after some key investors rejected a previous 254p a share offer. Their approval is also needed for this fresh offer. Morrisons, the UK's fourth-largest grocer, has almost 500 shops and more than 110,000 staff. It said in a statement: ""Morrisons directors believe that the increased Fortress offer is in the best interests of Morrisons shareholders as a whole, and accordingly unanimously recommend that Morrisons shareholders vote in favour of the resolutions required to implement the increased Fortress offer."" The retailer agreed to the takeover early in July after it turned down an offer worth Â£5.5bn from another firm, Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (CDR), saying it significantly undervalued the business. However, there have been reports CDR was planning its own new higher offer. Morrisons' shares were at 269p before news of the offer began circulating. They then rose more than 2% to 278p in lunchtime trading, higher than the new Fortress offer and a sign that some investors think the bidding war might not be over. Under the UK's takeover rules, CDR has until 9 August to table any new offer. Major Morrisons shareholders include Silchester, which has more than 15%, as well as money managers M&G and JO Hambro. All shareholders in Morrisons are due to vote on the Fortress bid on 16 August. It needs at least 75% approval to pass. If shareholders agree, it will be the second major UK supermarket to change ownership this year. In June, regulators approved the takeover of Leeds-based Asda from US retail giant Walmart for Â£6.8bn by the billionaire Issa Brothers, who were backed by private equity firm  TDR Capital. Morrisons started life as a market stall in Bradford in 1899, but it was not until 1961 that the first supermarket store opened under the name. In 2004, the group bought rival grocer Safeway for Â£3bn, giving it a bigger slice of the market in southern England.

"US news network CNN has sacked three employees for going into an office without having been vaccinated against Covid, US media say. It is one of the first examples of a US firm firing staff for breaching a company vaccination mandate. It is legal in the US for firms to require employees to be vaccinated. Many large firms -including Facebook and Google- say they will require employees to be vaccinated when offices fully re-open in the months ahead. CNN chief Jeff Zucker mentioned the dismissal in a company memo sent on Thursday and seen by several US media outlets. Vaccination is mandatory for anyone reporting in the field, working with any other employees or going into an office, he is quoted as saying in the memo. ""Let me be clear - we have a zero-tolerance policy on this,"" Mr Zucker, chairman of news and sports for WarnerMedia,is quoted as saying,external. In May the US government said it was legal for employers to require staff attending the workplace in person to be vaccinated against Covid-19. Major airlines Delta and United Airlines are requiring new employees to show proof of vaccination, while investment bank Goldman Sachs is requiring its employees to disclose their vaccination status, although does not require staff to be vaccinated, AP reports.

"Aaliyah was one of the last major stars to be absent from streaming services Aaliyah's biggest albums are to be made available on streaming services, after being out of circulation for most of the last two decades. The late R&B star's final two records, One in a Million and Aaliyah, have been in limbo for years - a result of legal issues and uneasiness in her family. Now, as the 20th anniversary of her death approaches, a deal has been struck to reissue the records. The rollout begins on 20 August with the release of One in a Million. New titles will be released throughout the rest of the year, including the soundtracks to the film Romeo Must Die, in which Aaliyah co-starred, as well as the compilations Ultimate Aaliyah and I Care 4 U. Why De La Soul's albums are absent from streaming The KLF's songs are finally available to stream The long out-of-print CD and vinyl versions, which currently fetch hundreds of dollars on the second-hand market, will also be reissued. The news was announced by Aaliyah's uncle and former manager Barry Hankerson, whose Blackground Records owned the rights to the star's back catalogue - with the exception of her debut album, Age Ain't Nothing But A Number, which is currently her only album available on streaming services.

Hankerson said he had entered a new partnership with music distribution company Empire, ""to introduce Aaliyah and Blackground's legacy to a new audience"". It will also enable the label to release albums by Timbaland, Toni Braxton and JoJo which have also been absent from streaming services. But JoJo, who eventually re-recorded her Blackground albums after a decade-long legal battle with the label, told fans she wouldn't make money from the re-releases. ""Just so you know - a stream of the re-recorded 2018 version supports me and helps me continue to do what I love,""she wrote on Twitter,external. ""Streaming the original unfortunately does not."" Aaliyah died in 2001, after a plane she was travelling in crashed and burst into flames shortly after taking off in the Bahamas. The star had been visiting the island to record a music video for her single, Rock The Boat. She was killed along with eight other passengers, including video director Douglas Kratz and record label executive Gina Smith. An investigation by America's National Transportation Safety Board later concluded the plane had been overloaded at the time of take off. Although she was only 22, the star had already left an indelible imprint on R&B, with sleek, futuristic songs like We Need A Resolution, More Than A Woman and Are You That Somebody? Her influence can still be heard in the music of Rihanna, Drake, Alicia Keys and BeyoncÃ©. The star's uncle said the family's grief had been partly responsible for keeping her music out of circulation, after Blackground's distribution deals with Universal Music petered out in the early 2000s. Aaliyah's mother, in particular, was against the idea of re-releasing the music. ""There was a conversation we had that she didn't want the music out, and whatever my sister told me, I tried to do what she wanted me to do,""he told Billboard magazine,external. ""As a parent, I would understand if she did not want the music out. Because who wants to hear the voice of your daughter who's gone? So when she said that to me, I said, 'OK, we're not putting it out. I don't know when, but one day we will.' We literally packed everything up and went on to something else."" The singer sold 14 million albums in the US alone The turning point came last August, on the 19th anniversary of Aaliyah's death, when the star's estatereleased a statement,externaladdressed to ""our loyal fans"". ""We are excited to announce that communication has commenced between the estate and various record labels about the status of Aaliyah's music catalogue, as well as its availability on streaming platforms in the near future,"" it read. ""Thank you for your continued love and support. More updates to come!"" Hankerson took that as a green light and began negotiating the deal that will result in her music being restored. However, shortly after an announcement teasing the releases appeared online, the star's estate issued a statement apparently disapproving of the move. ""We have always been confused as to why there is such a tenacity in causing more pain alongside what we already have to cope with for the rest of our lives,""it read,external. ""This unscrupulous endeavour to release Aaliyah's music without any transparency or full accounting to the estate compels our hearts to express a word - forgiveness. ""Ultimately, we desire closure and a modicum of peace so we can facilitate the growth of the Aaliyah Memorial Fund and other creative projects that embody Aaliyah's true essence, which is to inspire strength and positivity for people of all creeds, races and cultures around the world."" For now, however, the release plans appear to be going ahead. Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

"Job starting salaries are rising at record rates due to shortages in candidates, according to KPMG. Rising demand for staff to fill vacancies resulted in the sharpest salary inflation rate in almost 24 years of data collection, its jobs survey found. However, ongoing uncertainty over job security concerns caused a ""severe drop"" in candidates in July, it said. Candidate numbers fell at the second-fastest rate in the survey's history. The lack of available candidates continued to decline rapidly in July, driven by ""concerns over job security due to the pandemic, a lack of European workers due to Brexit, and a generally low unemployment rate"", the report by KPMG and the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) said. The BBC has approached the Home Office for comment. Job vacancies soar as skills shortage bites Restaurants struggle for staff ahead of reopening Claire Warnes, partner and head of education, skills and productivity at KPMG UK, said job seekers should be ""taking advantage"" of the bounce in salaries for new recruits. Companies were wanting to invest in their businesses now coronavirus restrictions had been eased but demand for new staff outstripped supply, she added. ""We know that reskilling and upskilling is needed to help people move between sectors, and there's no doubt the 'pingdemic' has added an extra dimension to the recruitment challenge,"" said Ms Warnes. ""Plus, with furlough due to end soon, there may be a downward pressure on pay to come."" Kate Shoesmith, deputy chief executive of the REC, said the data confirmed that it was now a ""good time to be looking for a new job"". ""Employers are desperate to find good candidates for the many jobs on offer and this is reflected in starting salaries rising at the sharpest rate since the survey began in 1997,"" she said. ""This will likely motivate more people to be on the lookout for new opportunities. The same goes for those on temporary contracts which are also seeing increased pay."" Several industries, including the hospitality and haulage sectors, are experiencing chronic shortages in workers. Some of the many skilled jobs in short supply include chefs, software engineers, technicians and carers. The report found latest vacancy data indicated faster increases in demand for both permanent and temporary workers in July. The report said the removal of Covid restrictions had led to a ""sharp increase"" in the number of people employed into permanent job roles, while the upturn in temporary vacancies was the steepest since November 1997. July survey data signalled an upturn in demand for temporary workers as well. So-called ""blue collar"" workers remained at the top of the rankings, followed closely by hotel and catering staff. Jobs in IT and computing, hotel and catering and engineering were in high demand for permanent roles, while retail vacancies were the least in demand. In the private sector, demand for permanent staff expanded at a slightly quicker pace than for temporary workers. In contrast, short-term vacancies rose more quickly than permanent roles in the public sector. However, Ms Shoesmith warned pay increases alone won't meet the demand built up over recent months. ""We need an immigration system that flexes to meet demand as was promised, and business and government need a long-term plan for skilling up workers,"" she said.

"Energy prices will rise for millions of people across the UK in October, right at the start of the cold weather. Regulator Ofgem said the price cap for default domestic energy deals would be raised to cover suppliers' extra costs. The typical gas and electricity customer is likely to see their bill go up by Â£139 to Â£1,277 a year. Charities warned the timing would hit struggling families hard, who already face losing an extra Â£20 a week from Universal Credit in October. Prepayment customers will see an increase of Â£153, from Â£1,156 to Â£1309, the regulator said. Ofgem chief executive Jonathan Brearley told the BBC: ""The reason the price cap is going up is there has been a record increase in energy prices across the board, not just in gas and electricity but in petrol and diesel."" He urged customers to shop around for the best tariffs, saying there were big savings to be made by switching. ""You don't have to live with this tariff. The price cap is a backstop. We'd encourage any customer, particularly those struggling to pay their bills, to contact their supplier, and get access to a wide-range of help and support,"" he said. ""This is a devastating increase,"" said Peter Smith, director of policy and advocacy at fuel poverty charity National Energy Action. ""Millions of household budgets are already stretched to the limit and this massive increase could not be coming at a worse time."" How does the energy price cap affect my bill? Charities say energy choice needed in poorer homes Inaccurate gas and electricity bills criticised Energy prices to rise for millions of households Ofgem said rising wholesale costs were behind the increase, adding that the existence of the price cap meant households would save between Â£75-Â£100 a year. The watchdog also pointed out energy users could switch to a better deal to save up to Â£200. However, the Resolution Foundation says policymakers need to do more to help families who are close to the poverty line. Jonathan Marshall, senior economist, said the government must focus on widening the current warm homes discount scheme, as well as reversing the planned removal of the Â£20 Universal Credit uplift. There should also be more targeted support for families at risk of falling into fuel poverty. ""A rise in in energy prices will disproportionately impact those who are already struggling,"" said Mr Marshall. Domestic energy bills are linked to wholesale prices, which have gone up this year The price cap, set twice a year by the regulator, affects 11 million households in England, Wales and Scotland who have never switched suppliers or whose discounted deals have expired. Northern Ireland sets its own cap. That accounts for about half of all UK households. The remainder are on so-called fixed deals, which will not be affected. Around four million prepayment meter customers will also be affected. The cap sets the prices that suppliers can charge for each unit of energy, but that does not mean there is a limit to how much people can pay. The more gas and electricity you use, the higher the bill. ""Finding an extra Â£20 a month for energy bills will leave me with a stark choice of paying for either food or fuel,"" says Anthony Lyman of Northampton. The 35-year-old autistic single father of two adds: ""We may have to have a cold house to have a full belly."" Anthony lost his job at a special needs school through ill-health at the start of the pandemic and has since been relying on Universal Credit and help with managing his finances from debt charity Christians Against Poverty, as well as being forced to turn to food banks. ""We've been relying on the Universal Credit uplift money to get by but the prospect of losing that Â£20 a week in October and having to pay more for gas and electricity will leave me on a financial knife-edge."" The energy industry has said there's plenty of help for vulnerable people like Anthony but he says in practice it's almost impossible to get it. ""We haven't been able to get in touch with anybody from our suppliers during the pandemic. You can only seem to talk to a computer and it's very difficult to tell a computer I'm struggling.""

Wholesale prices have risen after gas prices soared to a record high as many economies recovered strongly from the Covid-19 crisis, prompting a surge in demand for energy. When wholesale prices fell last summer following the first lockdown, Ofgem reduced the level of the cap by Â£84 for last winter. But in February it increased the cap by Â£96 as wholesale costs rose. Since then the wholesale cost of energy - which account for 40% of domestic bills - has climbed by more than 50%, which has led to the latest increase. EDF, one of the UK's biggest energy providers, said the ""unprecedented rate"" at which wholesale prices were rising meant that customers would ""at some point see the impact of this global trend"". A spokesman said: ""We know this will be worrying news for customers of all suppliers - we will be directing financial assistance to those most in need through a Â£1.9m support fund, helping customers reduce their bills, manage their debt and even helping with costs for things like more energy efficient white goods."" The industry's trade body, Energy UK, said people worried about their bills should ""pick up the phone and talk to your supplier"". Chief executive Emma Pinchbeck told the BBC's Today radio programme: ""There's help and assistance available, particularly for those that are vulnerable and fuel poor."" She also urged people to consider switching supplier, calling it a ""straightforward"" process. The government also advised people to shop around for the cheapest tariffs, adding that it had simplified the process. A spokesperson for the Business Department said: ""To help consumers further, we plan to trial automatic switching for customers on expensive default tariffs to cheaper deals, and are extending the Warm Home Discount so an extra 750,000 households get Â£150 knocked off their bill each year."" When the energy price cap was introduced three years ago, it was hailed as a shield for customers against unscrupulous energy companies charging sky-high prices. But this October, the cap will rise to its highest ever level, so is it working? The cap applies to a company's default tariff, impacting people who never or rarely change their deal, and also those on pre-payment meters who often have less choice. While it restricted expensive prices at some companies, there have been accusations that the cap gave other firms an excuse to raise their prices up to same level as the cap. When fixing the cap point, the regulator says it must consider the wholesale price of gas and electricity so that companies can still make a profit. That's what they describe as setting a fair price. The result is that we've seen more standardised pricing across energy companies at those top rates, but not necessarily a market that's cheaper for most customers. With many people continuing to work from home through the autumn and winter months, and other budgets already being stretched with reductions to Universal Credit, this big jump in utility bills will be an unwelcome extra pressure. Fuel poverty charities are calling on Ofgem to provide deeper protection for the most vulnerable customers Energy users on variable tariffs could move to a different cheaper deal with their existing supplier or switch to another one to save up to hundreds of pounds. Switching online is relatively simple: just use an energy comparison site and all you'll need is your postcode, the name of your current supplier, and the name of your current tariff. But some vulnerable people may not be able to switch, warns National Energy Action. ""For some customers, switching is impossible due to levels of debt, or because pre-pay customers have far fewer options to switch supplier or tariff,"" added Mr Smith. The charity has called on Ofgem to provide deeper protection for the most vulnerable customers. ""The UK government can also directly help reduce energy arrears as well as maintaining investment to reduce needless energy waste in our homes,"" he said. Energy users can save hundreds by switching to a lower-priced fixed deal. All suppliers have fixed-rate deals, so the simplest way to save is to contact your existing supplier and ask to be moved to its lowest-priced fixed deal. But you could probably save more by switching to a rival, Ofgem says. It's simple to switch using an energy comparison site - all you'll need is your postcode, the name of your current supplier, and the name of your current tariff. Citizens Advice has a useful guide,externalto choosing the right tariff. Ofgem alsosets out the steps you should take to switch energy supplier,externaland shop for a better deal.

"Another woman has been sexually harassed in hotel quarantine despite new rules designed to prevent it. Last month the government said female guests would get female guards. However, Lorna Farmer, 28, walked out of the Hilton Garden Inn at Birmingham airport a week ago, after a guard offered to ""entertain"" her in her room. The Department of Health and Social Care now says it will introduce a new phone line for women to report harassment confidentially. Eighteen women have now reported harassment to the BBC - two of them since the DHSC took steps to fix the problem in July. The new measures included a new dedicated complaints system and extra training for guards on how to behave around lone women, as well as the plan for women to be supervised by female guards ""when available"". Lorna Farmer says, however, that she was only escorted outside on exercise breaks by male guards. She says she began receiving unwanted attention from a security guard employed by the company, Mitie, soon after arriving at the Hilton Garden Inn on Sunday 25 July. He asked to see her in her pyjamas, and asked to enter her room, she says - knocking repeatedly on her door and sometimes sitting on the floor outside it. Travellers arriving from countries on the UK's red list have to quarantine for 10 full days in designated hotels Nearly 124,000 people had been through the system by mid-July The cost is Â£1,750 for a single adult,rising to Â£2,285 on 12 August,external, and includes Covid tests on days two and eight Guests must stay in their room at all times except when escorted outside by guards for exercise - food is delivered to the room and guests do their own cleaning Security companies are hired by the government - the maximum value of Mitie's contract from February to October is Â£19.6m, the maximum value of G4s's is Â£66.5m What are the rules for travelling to green, amber and red-list countries? On one occasion, when she was cleaning her room, he said: ""Why don't you put that Hoover down and I'll come in and entertain you."" Ms Farmer says he repeated this another five times within the space of 10 minutes. When she complained to the head of the security team in the hotel, from the company Mitie, the guard was removed. But Ms Farmer says a different guard had also made lewd comments to female guests during their exercise break, so she still felt unsafe and got her father to come and drive her home. She then reported the harassment to police in Northamptonshire, where she is from. Mitie said: ""Should a complaint be raised by a guest a full investigation is carried out. In this case, the investigation found that the officer had not followed our procedures and therefore is no longer working on the contract."" Asked whether he was still working for Mitie, and whether he might now be working at a different quarantine hotel, a spokesperson said she could not share personal information about staff. Lorna Farmer's first quarantine hotel, the Hilton Garden Inn at Birmingham airport The Hilton Garden Inn emphasised that security firms were contracted by the DHSC and fell outside its responsibility. The DHSC said: ""Sexual harassment or abuse is completely unacceptable and totally abhorrent. We take all such allegations extremely seriously and we expect providers to take firm action - including suspending staff or reporting them to the police where appropriate - as has happened in this case."" It said the new confidential reporting line for lone female guests would be staffed by recently retired and trained police officers. Another woman, who is still in quarantine, says that a male security guard knocked on her door twice in one evening, giving a transparently bogus reason for wanting to talk to her. She said she was not reporting the incident because she felt unsafe and was not leaving her room. Women say they were sexually harassed by guards Women in hotel quarantine to get female guards Ms Farmer told the BBC that when she went outside for exercise at the Hilton Garden Inn, she was always escorted by a single male guard, despite the DHSC's intention that lone female guests should get female guards. Three other women quarantining since the rule change have told the BBC that they too had male guards. Others have said that they have mostly had female guards, though one added that ""once you're outside it's like being a walking exhibit with male guards sitting all around the parking lot like it's a gallery and looking you up and down as you walk"". In July, the government said that if female guards were unavailable, lone women should be escorted by two male guards, ""with each guard chaperoning the other to ensure appropriate behaviour"". This idea was sharply criticised by some women's safety campaigners and, judging from the reports of women in quarantine, appears to have been rarely adopted in practice. Lorna Farmer's second quarantine hotel, the Crowne Plaza NEC After walking out of the Hilton Garden Inn on Friday and spending the weekend at home, Lorna Farmer was called on Tuesday by an official who told her that West Midlands Police were looking for her, and that she could be arrested and fined Â£10,000 if she didn't return to quarantine. She says she felt very uneasy when two men then arrived in a van with darkened windows to accompany her to another quarantine hotel, the Crowne Plaza NEC. Here she was escorted outside for exercise by a female security guard, but says she only saw male guards on her corridor. Mitie says there was a female guard on her floor at all times, and that at least two female officers were always on shift at each hotel, in line with DHSC guidance. The company added that it was taking active steps to increase the number of female officers working in quarantine hotels. According to the Security Industry Authority only 10% of licenced security guards in the UK are women. Carry a door wedgeor jammer in case your door doesn't have a second lock.

A loved one may help you assess the situation and decide on the safest course of action, which may be to call the emergency services. Carolyn Pearson, founder of Maiden-Voyage.com Ms Farmer says she thinks it is ""ridiculous"" for lone women to be forced to quarantine in hotels when their safety cannot be guaranteed. ""The woman from public health said, 'Lorna, are you aware that West Midlands Police are looking for you, that they've put you down as absconded?' I was like, 'No, I spoke to Northamptonshire Police and reported everything that's happened, and they are absolutely happy with me being home.' ""And she was like, 'You have to come back today, otherwise we will come and get you and you'll be prosecuted and fined.' And I was like, 'Are you serious? After everything that's happened?'"" Ms Farmer was allowed to leave the hotel on Thursday, 11 days after she arrived in the UK from Dubai. West Midlands Victims' Commissioner Nicky Brennan said she was ""disgusted"" to hear how women were being treated by security staff in quarantine hotels. ""The government who have given the contract and the security company need to investigate the practices, training and conduct of staff with urgency. People who are quarantining in hotels at the orders of the government should not have to feel unsafe when following those rules. ""This would appear to be a problem across the country with security staff in these hotels. It's worrying for anybody, especially lone women that they could be treated in this way.

Carolyn Pearson, founder of Maiden-Voyage.com Ms Farmer says she thinks it is ""ridiculous"" for lone women to be forced to quarantine in hotels when their safety cannot be guaranteed. ""The woman from public health said, 'Lorna, are you aware that West Midlands Police are looking for you, that they've put you down as absconded?' I was like, 'No, I spoke to Northamptonshire Police and reported everything that's happened, and they are absolutely happy with me being home.' ""And she was like, 'You have to come back today, otherwise we will come and get you and you'll be prosecuted and fined.' And I was like, 'Are you serious? After everything that's happened?'"" Ms Farmer was allowed to leave the hotel on Thursday, 11 days after she arrived in the UK from Dubai. West Midlands Victims' Commissioner Nicky Brennan said she was ""disgusted"" to hear how women were being treated by security staff in quarantine hotels. ""The government who have given the contract and the security company need to investigate the practices, training and conduct of staff with urgency. People who are quarantining in hotels at the orders of the government should not have to feel unsafe when following those rules. ""This would appear to be a problem across the country with security staff in these hotels. It's worrying for anybody, especially lone women that they could be treated in this way. They should not be put in this position by a government which is meant to be keeping them safe.""

"Early signs suggest a year of high A-level grades, says a university's head of admissions A-level results next week in England, Wales and Northern Ireland could see high levels of top grades, according to an annual analysis of exam trends. Prof Alan Smithers, at the University of Buckingham, is predicting a ""bumper crop"" of A* and A grades, in results for exams cancelled by the pandemic. But he warns against allowing ""grade inflation"" to become the norm. The University of East Anglia (UEA) is also reporting early signs that it could be a ""record year for grades"". There have been suggestions that if more pupils receive high grades - which are being submitted by teachers for a second year in a row - there will be a crush for places at the most sought-after universities and courses. There is also pressure from record numbers applying, with more than 680,000 seeking university places. Prof Smithers said some universities could consider introducing their own exams to help them choose between students. There have already been reports of oversubscribed medicine courses trying to get applicants to defer for a year -such as at the University of Exeter,where students were offered Â£10,000 to delay. But Richard Harvey, director of admissions at UEA, reassured students that even if grades are higher than last year's record high levels, there is capacity in the university system. What's different with this year's A-levels? Students offered cash to defer medical degree Parents pressure teachers over exam grades Last summer's big exam grades U-turn ""Of course that will cause pressure in certain subjects, mostly medical ones, and in certain universities. At UEA, medicine and related subjects look a bit pressured, but in other subjects I do hope we can continue to welcome people, so I'd encourage people to get in touch,"" he said. Universities get an advance sight of whether applicants have achieved their required grades, and will be going through their admission decisions ahead of the official release of results next week. There is expected to be particular pressure on places for medical and dentistry courses - with a 20% increase in applications and more students expected to get the required grades this year. The Department for Education says it will create more places and flexibility - allowing ""over 9,000 places"" - but with no fixed numbers for an increase. Last year, there was an intake of almost 9,300 for these medicine and dentistry courses. Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was much harder to create more places for medicine because of the high cost of training doctors, the length of the course and the need for hospital placements. Mr Hillman said he was ""a little bit uncomfortable"" with the suggestion that students could be asked if they wanted to shift to other medical schools with more capacity. ""If you've had your sights set on one particular medical school from the moment you applied or even the moment you started your A-levels, it's quite a big mental jump to decide you're going to go somewhere else,"" he said. This will be the second year in which results will be decided without pupils taking the usual set of exam papers. Schools submitted grades for pupils, based on a range of evidence, including mini-exams, mock exams and coursework, and next week will see the final results issued by exam boards. Last year saw huge controversy after an initial downgrading of many pupils' grades - which was then reversed in a U-turn which saw the highest-ever proportion of A* and A grades. Almost two in five A-levels, 38.5%, were awarded an A* or A last year after the U-turn, up from 25.5% for pupils in 2019. Prof Smithers,in his annual pre-results report,,externalsuggests results are once again going to be very high, or even higher, to compensate for the disruption facing pupils. ""While logically there is no reason why A-level standards should not be restored to what they were in 2019, my fear is that the various pressures will cause the government to allow what they became in 2020 to stand,"" he said. He warned that issuing so many top grades makes it hard for universities to distinguish between students. ""Leading universities could be forced to set their own tests to help them distinguish between the many prospective students awarded straight As,"" said Prof Smithers. But Prof Graham Galbraith, vice chancellor of the University of Portsmouth, rejected the focus on grade inflation. ""These young people have had a very difficult time since March 2020. How their grades compare with other years is of secondary importance. We should prioritise this year's students and treat this year as the extreme exception it obviously is,"" he said. Tom Middlehurst, of the ASCL head teachers' union, said speculation about grades was ""unhelpful"" and said that if grades were higher this year ""it would be a reflection of the system devised by the government and [regulator] Ofqual"" rather than a decision by teachers. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson, promising extra places for medical courses, said: ""Students have worked incredibly hard over the past 18 months and we have continued to put their best interests first to ensure they can progress on to the next stage of their education training or career.""

"Gas and electricity bills are going up again on 1 January, when the latest energy price cap takes effect. Customers are encouraged to submit a meter reading to ensure they are charged the correct amount. The energy price cap covers 26 million households in England, Wales and Scotland and is setevery three months,externalby the energy regulator Ofgem. It fixes the maximum price that can be charged for each unit of energy on a standard - or default - tariff for a typical dual-fuel household which pays by direct debit. Between 1 January and 31 March 2025,gas prices will be capped at 6.34p per kilowatt hour (kWh), and electricity at 24.86 per kWh.,external This means the annual bill for a dual-fuel direct debit household using a typical amount of energywill go up to Â£1,738 per year, an increase of Â£21 from the previous cap. Those who pay their bills every three months by cash or cheque will pay Â£1,851. Analysts at forecaster Cornwall Insight, which tracks the energy market, expect prices to fall slightly in April and October 2025, but says thathigh domestic energy prices are likely to be ""the new normal"". The cap does not apply in Northern Ireland, which has its own energy market. Your energy bill depends on the overall amount of gas and electricity you use, and how you pay for it. The type of property you live in, how energy efficient it is, how many people live there and the weather all make a difference. The Ofgem cap is based on a ""typical household"" using 11,500 kWh of gas and 2,700 kWh of electricity a year with a single bill for gas and electricity, settled by direct debit. The vast majority of people pay their bill this way to help spread payments across the year. Those who pay every three months by cash or cheque are charged more. Energy prices could vary at different times of day Submitting a meter reading when the cap changes means you will not be charged for estimated usage at the wrong rate. This is especially important when prices go up. Customers withworking smart metersdo not need to submit a reading as their bill is calculated automatically. Fixed-priced deals offer certainty for a set period - often a year, or longer - but if prices drop, you could be stuck at a higher price. Ofgem says customers who want the security of a set price should consider fixed deals. However, it recommends getting independent advice. The price comparison site Uswitch says it is important to check whether fixed deals have exit fees before signing up and to make sure you fully understand the terms of the contract. Because the price cap changes every three months, it is difficult to know with any certainty whether a fixed tariff is a good deal. The longer the fixed term, the greater the uncertainty. Between January and March, households on prepayment meters will pay slightly less than those on direct debit, with a typical bill of Â£1,690, a rise of Â£21 from the previous quarter. About four million households had prepayment meters in April 2024, according to Ofgem. Many have been in place for years, but some were installed more recently after customers struggled to pay higher bills. Rulesintroduced in November 2023,externalmean suppliers must give customers more opportunity to clear their debts before switching them to a meter. They cannot be installed at all in certain households. Energy firms pay out over force-fitting of meters Standing charges are a fixed daily fee to cover the costs of connecting to a supply. They are typically 61p a day for electricity and 32p a day for gas, although they vary slightly by region. Under the energy price cap, they have risen by 43% since 2019. Campaigners argue standing charges are unfair because they make up a larger proportion of the bill of low energy users. Ofgem has proposed thatenergy firms must provide a choice of price-capped tariffsfrom winter 2025, one which has a standing charge and unit rate - as is the case now - and another with no standing charge but a higher unit rate. Customers would be able to choose which suits them best. Separately, it wants a consistent approach from suppliers on how to deal with unpaid bills totalling Â£3.8bn. Changes to the winter fuel payment mean more than 10 million pensioners are not receiving the money this winter. Previously, it was paid to all pensioners in England and Wales born before 25 September 1957. However, in July, the government said future payments would be made only to those on low incomes who receivedcertain benefits, including pension credit. The 2024 payment - worth Â£200 or Â£300 depending on individual circumstances - is paid automatically to eligible pensioners. However, hundreds of thousands of people who are entitled to pension credit do not claim it, which means they will miss out on the winter fuel payment too. How much is the winter fuel payment and who can still get it? TheÂ£500m Household Support Fund,,externalwhich was introduced in September 2021 to help vulnerable customershas been extended until March 2025. TheWarm Home Discount scheme,externalcontinues to offer a discount to eligible pensioners and low income households. The government'sFuel Direct Scheme,externalcan help people to repay an energy debt directly from their benefit payments. In addition, suppliers must offer customers affordable payment plans or repayment holidays if they are struggling with bills. Most suppliers also offer hardship grants.

"Modern prepayment meters can be topped up online People who use prepayment energy meters should be at the front of the queue in a shift to new, money-saving energy technology, charities have said. National Energy Action, which lobbies for action for warm and dry homes, said some people were forced outside during lockdowns to top-up old meters. Following consultation with a host of charities, it said replacing these old meters should be given priority. Smart meters are being installed in households across the country. National Energy Action spoke to 130 organisations across the UK that work with low income and vulnerable energy consumers. Many lower-income residents and tenants pay for their electricity and gas via prepayment meters often online, but possibly by buying credit at shops and post offices. Its report. published on Tuesday, suggested families with the oldest prepayment meters faced extra difficulty during the Covid crisis to keep the lights on and to keep homes warm. Some had to go out to shops, when they would have otherwise stayed at home, to pay to top-up meters. ""There is clear evidence vulnerable energy customers with older pay-as-you-go meters were put at needless risk during pandemic,"" said Frazer Scott, chief executive of Energy Action Scotland and co-author of the report. Smart meters are being installed across the UK He said replacing these meters should be the priority for the smart meter roll-out, as well as capping how much these customers paid. The introduction of smart meters into British households has not been smooth, with concerns raised over missed targets, faulty technology and concerns for some customers switching suppliers. However, the move has been marketed as an opportunity to make the system more efficient, by ending manual meter readings, and to save customers money. Robert Cheesewright, from Smart Energy GB - which promotes the technology, said: ""Getting smart prepayment meters can be life changing for households. We must make sure low-income, vulnerable and prepay customers benefit from smart meters and the roll-out."" The report comes shortly after advice charity Citizens Advice warned that gas and electricity customers were still beingplagued by inaccurate billsfrom the UK's worst-rated suppliers.

"Energy prices will rise for millions of people across the UK in October, right at the start of the cold weather. Regulator Ofgem said the price cap for default domestic energy deals would be raised to cover suppliers' extra costs. The typical gas and electricity customer is likely to see their bill go up by Â£139 to Â£1,277 a year. Charities warned the timing would hit struggling families hard, who already face losing an extra Â£20 a week from Universal Credit in October. Prepayment customers will see an increase of Â£153, from Â£1,156 to Â£1309, the regulator said. Ofgem chief executive Jonathan Brearley told the BBC: ""The reason the price cap is going up is there has been a record increase in energy prices across the board, not just in gas and electricity but in petrol and diesel."" He urged customers to shop around for the best tariffs, saying there were big savings to be made by switching. ""You don't have to live with this tariff. The price cap is a backstop. We'd encourage any customer, particularly those struggling to pay their bills, to contact their supplier, and get access to a wide-range of help and support,"" he said. ""This is a devastating increase,"" said Peter Smith, director of policy and advocacy at fuel poverty charity National Energy Action. ""Millions of household budgets are already stretched to the limit and this massive increase could not be coming at a worse time."" How does the energy price cap affect my bill? Charities say energy choice needed in poorer homes Inaccurate gas and electricity bills criticised Energy prices to rise for millions of households Ofgem said rising wholesale costs were behind the increase, adding that the existence of the price cap meant households would save between Â£75-Â£100 a year. The watchdog also pointed out energy users could switch to a better deal to save up to Â£200. However, the Resolution Foundation says policymakers need to do more to help families who are close to the poverty line. Jonathan Marshall, senior economist, said the government must focus on widening the current warm homes discount scheme, as well as reversing the planned removal of the Â£20 Universal Credit uplift. There should also be more targeted support for families at risk of falling into fuel poverty. ""A rise in in energy prices will disproportionately impact those who are already struggling,"" said Mr Marshall. Domestic energy bills are linked to wholesale prices, which have gone up this year The price cap, set twice a year by the regulator, affects 11 million households in England, Wales and Scotland who have never switched suppliers or whose discounted deals have expired. Northern Ireland sets its own cap. That accounts for about half of all UK households. The remainder are on so-called fixed deals, which will not be affected. Around four million prepayment meter customers will also be affected. The cap sets the prices that suppliers can charge for each unit of energy, but that does not mean there is a limit to how much people can pay. The more gas and electricity you use, the higher the bill. ""Finding an extra Â£20 a month for energy bills will leave me with a stark choice of paying for either food or fuel,"" says Anthony Lyman of Northampton. The 35-year-old autistic single father of two adds: ""We may have to have a cold house to have a full belly."" Anthony lost his job at a special needs school through ill-health at the start of the pandemic and has since been relying on Universal Credit and help with managing his finances from debt charity Christians Against Poverty, as well as being forced to turn to food banks. ""We've been relying on the Universal Credit uplift money to get by but the prospect of losing that Â£20 a week in October and having to pay more for gas and electricity will leave me on a financial knife-edge."" The energy industry has said there's plenty of help for vulnerable people like Anthony but he says in practice it's almost impossible to get it. ""We haven't been able to get in touch with anybody from our suppliers during the pandemic. You can only seem to talk to a computer and it's very difficult to tell a computer I'm struggling.""

Wholesale prices have risen after gas prices soared to a record high as many economies recovered strongly from the Covid-19 crisis, prompting a surge in demand for energy. When wholesale prices fell last summer following the first lockdown, Ofgem reduced the level of the cap by Â£84 for last winter. But in February it increased the cap by Â£96 as wholesale costs rose. Since then the wholesale cost of energy - which account for 40% of domestic bills - has climbed by more than 50%, which has led to the latest increase. EDF, one of the UK's biggest energy providers, said the ""unprecedented rate"" at which wholesale prices were rising meant that customers would ""at some point see the impact of this global trend"". A spokesman said: ""We know this will be worrying news for customers of all suppliers - we will be directing financial assistance to those most in need through a Â£1.9m support fund, helping customers reduce their bills, manage their debt and even helping with costs for things like more energy efficient white goods."" The industry's trade body, Energy UK, said people worried about their bills should ""pick up the phone and talk to your supplier"". Chief executive Emma Pinchbeck told the BBC's Today radio programme: ""There's help and assistance available, particularly for those that are vulnerable and fuel poor."" She also urged people to consider switching supplier, calling it a ""straightforward"" process. The government also advised people to shop around for the cheapest tariffs, adding that it had simplified the process. A spokesperson for the Business Department said: ""To help consumers further, we plan to trial automatic switching for customers on expensive default tariffs to cheaper deals, and are extending the Warm Home Discount so an extra 750,000 households get Â£150 knocked off their bill each year."" When the energy price cap was introduced three years ago, it was hailed as a shield for customers against unscrupulous energy companies charging sky-high prices. But this October, the cap will rise to its highest ever level, so is it working? The cap applies to a company's default tariff, impacting people who never or rarely change their deal, and also those on pre-payment meters who often have less choice. While it restricted expensive prices at some companies, there have been accusations that the cap gave other firms an excuse to raise their prices up to same level as the cap. When fixing the cap point, the regulator says it must consider the wholesale price of gas and electricity so that companies can still make a profit. That's what they describe as setting a fair price. The result is that we've seen more standardised pricing across energy companies at those top rates, but not necessarily a market that's cheaper for most customers. With many people continuing to work from home through the autumn and winter months, and other budgets already being stretched with reductions to Universal Credit, this big jump in utility bills will be an unwelcome extra pressure. Fuel poverty charities are calling on Ofgem to provide deeper protection for the most vulnerable customers Energy users on variable tariffs could move to a different cheaper deal with their existing supplier or switch to another one to save up to hundreds of pounds. Switching online is relatively simple: just use an energy comparison site and all you'll need is your postcode, the name of your current supplier, and the name of your current tariff. But some vulnerable people may not be able to switch, warns National Energy Action. ""For some customers, switching is impossible due to levels of debt, or because pre-pay customers have far fewer options to switch supplier or tariff,"" added Mr Smith. The charity has called on Ofgem to provide deeper protection for the most vulnerable customers. ""The UK government can also directly help reduce energy arrears as well as maintaining investment to reduce needless energy waste in our homes,"" he said. Energy users can save hundreds by switching to a lower-priced fixed deal. All suppliers have fixed-rate deals, so the simplest way to save is to contact your existing supplier and ask to be moved to its lowest-priced fixed deal. But you could probably save more by switching to a rival, Ofgem says. It's simple to switch using an energy comparison site - all you'll need is your postcode, the name of your current supplier, and the name of your current tariff. Citizens Advice has a useful guide,externalto choosing the right tariff. Ofgem alsosets out the steps you should take to switch energy supplier,externaland shop for a better deal.

"Another woman has been sexually harassed in hotel quarantine despite new rules designed to prevent it. Last month the government said female guests would get female guards. However, Lorna Farmer, 28, walked out of the Hilton Garden Inn at Birmingham airport a week ago, after a guard offered to ""entertain"" her in her room. The Department of Health and Social Care now says it will introduce a new phone line for women to report harassment confidentially. Eighteen women have now reported harassment to the BBC - two of them since the DHSC took steps to fix the problem in July. The new measures included a new dedicated complaints system and extra training for guards on how to behave around lone women, as well as the plan for women to be supervised by female guards ""when available"". Lorna Farmer says, however, that she was only escorted outside on exercise breaks by male guards. She says she began receiving unwanted attention from a security guard employed by the company, Mitie, soon after arriving at the Hilton Garden Inn on Sunday 25 July. He asked to see her in her pyjamas, and asked to enter her room, she says - knocking repeatedly on her door and sometimes sitting on the floor outside it. Travellers arriving from countries on the UK's red list have to quarantine for 10 full days in designated hotels Nearly 124,000 people had been through the system by mid-July The cost is Â£1,750 for a single adult,rising to Â£2,285 on 12 August,external, and includes Covid tests on days two and eight Guests must stay in their room at all times except when escorted outside by guards for exercise - food is delivered to the room and guests do their own cleaning Security companies are hired by the government - the maximum value of Mitie's contract from February to October is Â£19.6m, the maximum value of G4s's is Â£66.5m What are the rules for travelling to green, amber and red-list countries? On one occasion, when she was cleaning her room, he said: ""Why don't you put that Hoover down and I'll come in and entertain you."" Ms Farmer says he repeated this another five times within the space of 10 minutes. When she complained to the head of the security team in the hotel, from the company Mitie, the guard was removed. But Ms Farmer says a different guard had also made lewd comments to female guests during their exercise break, so she still felt unsafe and got her father to come and drive her home. She then reported the harassment to police in Northamptonshire, where she is from. Mitie said: ""Should a complaint be raised by a guest a full investigation is carried out. In this case, the investigation found that the officer had not followed our procedures and therefore is no longer working on the contract."" Asked whether he was still working for Mitie, and whether he might now be working at a different quarantine hotel, a spokesperson said she could not share personal information about staff. Lorna Farmer's first quarantine hotel, the Hilton Garden Inn at Birmingham airport The Hilton Garden Inn emphasised that security firms were contracted by the DHSC and fell outside its responsibility. The DHSC said: ""Sexual harassment or abuse is completely unacceptable and totally abhorrent. We take all such allegations extremely seriously and we expect providers to take firm action - including suspending staff or reporting them to the police where appropriate - as has happened in this case."" It said the new confidential reporting line for lone female guests would be staffed by recently retired and trained police officers. Another woman, who is still in quarantine, says that a male security guard knocked on her door twice in one evening, giving a transparently bogus reason for wanting to talk to her. She said she was not reporting the incident because she felt unsafe and was not leaving her room. Women say they were sexually harassed by guards Women in hotel quarantine to get female guards Ms Farmer told the BBC that when she went outside for exercise at the Hilton Garden Inn, she was always escorted by a single male guard, despite the DHSC's intention that lone female guests should get female guards. Three other women quarantining since the rule change have told the BBC that they too had male guards. Others have said that they have mostly had female guards, though one added that ""once you're outside it's like being a walking exhibit with male guards sitting all around the parking lot like it's a gallery and looking you up and down as you walk"". In July, the government said that if female guards were unavailable, lone women should be escorted by two male guards, ""with each guard chaperoning the other to ensure appropriate behaviour"". This idea was sharply criticised by some women's safety campaigners and, judging from the reports of women in quarantine, appears to have been rarely adopted in practice. Lorna Farmer's second quarantine hotel, the Crowne Plaza NEC After walking out of the Hilton Garden Inn on Friday and spending the weekend at home, Lorna Farmer was called on Tuesday by an official who told her that West Midlands Police were looking for her, and that she could be arrested and fined Â£10,000 if she didn't return to quarantine. She says she felt very uneasy when two men then arrived in a van with darkened windows to accompany her to another quarantine hotel, the Crowne Plaza NEC. Here she was escorted outside for exercise by a female security guard, but says she only saw male guards on her corridor. Mitie says there was a female guard on her floor at all times, and that at least two female officers were always on shift at each hotel, in line with DHSC guidance. The company added that it was taking active steps to increase the number of female officers working in quarantine hotels. According to the Security Industry Authority only 10% of licenced security guards in the UK are women. Carry a door wedgeor jammer in case your door doesn't have a second lock. These should prevent anyone entering, even if they have a master key. Always use the peep hole or door chain before opening the door to anybody. Identify the security companyat your quarantine hotel and find emergency contact details - eg whistleblower numbers on their website. Note names, ID numbers or identifying features of anyone harassing you. Save notes and approaches via social media. Report the incident if and when you feel safe to do so. Be an allyif you see others being harassed. This may include recording the incident, taking notes, asking if the victim needs help, calling out the bad behaviour or reporting it. Speak to a loved one- when you're afraid, you may be less able to process events logically. A loved one may help you assess the situation and decide on the safest course of action, which may be to call the emergency services. Carolyn Pearson, founder of Maiden-Voyage.com Ms Farmer says she thinks it is ""ridiculous"" for lone women to be forced to quarantine in hotels when their safety cannot be guaranteed. ""The woman from public health said, 'Lorna, are you aware that West Midlands Police are looking for you, that they've put you down as absconded?' I was like, 'No, I spoke to Northamptonshire Police and reported everything that's happened, and they are absolutely happy with me being home.' ""And she was like, 'You have to come back today, otherwise we will come and get you and you'll be prosecuted and fined.' And I was like, 'Are you serious? After everything that's happened?'"" Ms Farmer was allowed to leave the hotel on Thursday, 11 days after she arrived in the UK from Dubai. West Midlands Victims' Commissioner Nicky Brennan said she was ""disgusted"" to hear how women were being treated by security staff in quarantine hotels. ""The government who have given the contract and the security company need to investigate the practices, training and conduct of staff with urgency. People who are quarantining in hotels at the orders of the government should not have to feel unsafe when following those rules. ""This would appear to be a problem across the country with security staff in these hotels. It's worrying for anybody, especially lone women that they could be treated in this way. They should not be put in this position by a government which is meant to be keeping them safe.""

"Gas and electricity bills are going up again on 1 January, when the latest energy price cap takes effect. Customers are encouraged to submit a meter reading to ensure they are charged the correct amount. The energy price cap covers 26 million households in England, Wales and Scotland and is setevery three months,externalby the energy regulator Ofgem. It fixes the maximum price that can be charged for each unit of energy on a standard - or default - tariff for a typical dual-fuel household which pays by direct debit. Between 1 January and 31 March 2025,gas prices will be capped at 6.34p per kilowatt hour (kWh), and electricity at 24.86 per kWh.,external This means the annual bill for a dual-fuel direct debit household using a typical amount of energywill go up to Â£1,738 per year, an increase of Â£21 from the previous cap. Those who pay their bills every three months by cash or cheque will pay Â£1,851. Analysts at forecaster Cornwall Insight, which tracks the energy market, expect prices to fall slightly in April and October 2025, but says thathigh domestic energy prices are likely to be ""the new normal"". The cap does not apply in Northern Ireland, which has its own energy market. Your energy bill depends on the overall amount of gas and electricity you use, and how you pay for it. The type of property you live in, how energy efficient it is, how many people live there and the weather all make a difference. The Ofgem cap is based on a ""typical household"" using 11,500 kWh of gas and 2,700 kWh of electricity a year with a single bill for gas and electricity, settled by direct debit. The vast majority of people pay their bill this way to help spread payments across the year. Those who pay every three months by cash or cheque are charged more. Energy prices could vary at different times of day Submitting a meter reading when the cap changes means you will not be charged for estimated usage at the wrong rate. This is especially important when prices go up. Customers withworking smart metersdo not need to submit a reading as their bill is calculated automatically. Fixed-priced deals offer certainty for a set period - often a year, or longer - but if prices drop, you could be stuck at a higher price. Ofgem says customers who want the security of a set price should consider fixed deals. However, it recommends getting independent advice. The price comparison site Uswitch says it is important to check whether fixed deals have exit fees before signing up and to make sure you fully understand the terms of the contract. Because the price cap changes every three months, it is difficult to know with any certainty whether a fixed tariff is a good deal. The longer the fixed term, the greater the uncertainty. Between January and March, households on prepayment meters will pay slightly less than those on direct debit, with a typical bill of Â£1,690, a rise of Â£21 from the previous quarter. About four million households had prepayment meters in April 2024, according to Ofgem. Many have been in place for years, but some were installed more recently after customers struggled to pay higher bills. Rulesintroduced in November 2023,externalmean suppliers must give customers more opportunity to clear their debts before switching them to a meter. They cannot be installed at all in certain households. Energy firms pay out over force-fitting of meters Standing charges are a fixed daily fee to cover the costs of connecting to a supply. They are typically 61p a day for electricity and 32p a day for gas, although they vary slightly by region. Under the energy price cap, they have risen by 43% since 2019. Campaigners argue standing charges are unfair because they make up a larger proportion of the bill of low energy users. Ofgem has proposed thatenergy firms must provide a choice of price-capped tariffsfrom winter 2025, one which has a standing charge and unit rate - as is the case now - and another with no standing charge but a higher unit rate. Customers would be able to choose which suits them best. Separately, it wants a consistent approach from suppliers on how to deal with unpaid bills totalling Â£3.8bn. Changes to the winter fuel payment mean more than 10 million pensioners are not receiving the money this winter. Previously, it was paid to all pensioners in England and Wales born before 25 September 1957. However, in July, the government said future payments would be made only to those on low incomes who receivedcertain benefits, including pension credit. The 2024 payment - worth Â£200 or Â£300 depending on individual circumstances - is paid automatically to eligible pensioners. However, hundreds of thousands of people who are entitled to pension credit do not claim it, which means they will miss out on the winter fuel payment too. How much is the winter fuel payment and who can still get it? TheÂ£500m Household Support Fund,,externalwhich was introduced in September 2021 to help vulnerable customershas been extended until March 2025. TheWarm Home Discount scheme,externalcontinues to offer a discount to eligible pensioners and low income households. The government'sFuel Direct Scheme,externalcan help people to repay an energy debt directly from their benefit payments. In addition, suppliers must offer customers affordable payment plans or repayment holidays if they are struggling with bills. Most suppliers also offer hardship grants.

"Modern prepayment meters can be topped up online People who use prepayment energy meters should be at the front of the queue in a shift to new, money-saving energy technology, charities have said. National Energy Action, which lobbies for action for warm and dry homes, said some people were forced outside during lockdowns to top-up old meters. Following consultation with a host of charities, it said replacing these old meters should be given priority. Smart meters are being installed in households across the country. National Energy Action spoke to 130 organisations across the UK that work with low income and vulnerable energy consumers. Many lower-income residents and tenants pay for their electricity and gas via prepayment meters often online, but possibly by buying credit at shops and post offices. Its report. published on Tuesday, suggested families with the oldest prepayment meters faced extra difficulty during the Covid crisis to keep the lights on and to keep homes warm. Some had to go out to shops, when they would have otherwise stayed at home, to pay to top-up meters. ""There is clear evidence vulnerable energy customers with older pay-as-you-go meters were put at needless risk during pandemic,"" said Frazer Scott, chief executive of Energy Action Scotland and co-author of the report. Smart meters are being installed across the UK He said replacing these meters should be the priority for the smart meter roll-out, as well as capping how much these customers paid. The introduction of smart meters into British households has not been smooth, with concerns raised over missed targets, faulty technology and concerns for some customers switching suppliers. However, the move has been marketed as an opportunity to make the system more efficient, by ending manual meter readings, and to save customers money. Robert Cheesewright, from Smart Energy GB - which promotes the technology, said: ""Getting smart prepayment meters can be life changing for households. We must make sure low-income, vulnerable and prepay customers benefit from smart meters and the roll-out.""

"Energy prices will rise for millions of people across the UK in October, right at the start of the cold weather. Regulator Ofgem said the price cap for default domestic energy deals would be raised to cover suppliers' extra costs. The typical gas and electricity customer is likely to see their bill go up by Â£139 to Â£1,277 a year. Charities warned the timing would hit struggling families hard, who already face losing an extra Â£20 a week from Universal Credit in October. Prepayment customers will see an increase of Â£153, from Â£1,156 to Â£1309, the regulator said. Ofgem chief executive Jonathan Brearley told the BBC: ""The reason the price cap is going up is there has been a record increase in energy prices across the board, not just in gas and electricity but in petrol and diesel."" He urged customers to shop around for the best tariffs, saying there were big savings to be made by switching. ""You don't have to live with this tariff. The price cap is a backstop. We'd encourage any customer, particularly those struggling to pay their bills, to contact their supplier, and get access to a wide-range of help and support,"" he said. ""This is a devastating increase,"" said Peter Smith, director of policy and advocacy at fuel poverty charity National Energy Action. ""Millions of household budgets are already stretched to the limit and this massive increase could not be coming at a worse time."" How does the energy price cap affect my bill? Charities say energy choice needed in poorer homes Inaccurate gas and electricity bills criticised Energy prices to rise for millions of households Ofgem said rising wholesale costs were behind the increase, adding that the existence of the price cap meant households would save between Â£75-Â£100 a year. The watchdog also pointed out energy users could switch to a better deal to save up to Â£200. However, the Resolution Foundation says policymakers need to do more to help families who are close to the poverty line. Jonathan Marshall, senior economist, said the government must focus on widening the current warm homes discount scheme, as well as reversing the planned removal of the Â£20 Universal Credit uplift. There should also be more targeted support for families at risk of falling into fuel poverty. ""A rise in in energy prices will disproportionately impact those who are already struggling,"" said Mr Marshall. Domestic energy bills are linked to wholesale prices, which have gone up this year The price cap, set twice a year by the regulator, affects 11 million households in England, Wales and Scotland who have never switched suppliers or whose discounted deals have expired. Northern Ireland sets its own cap. That accounts for about half of all UK households. The remainder are on so-called fixed deals, which will not be affected. Around four million prepayment meter customers will also be affected. The cap sets the prices that suppliers can charge for each unit of energy, but that does not mean there is a limit to how much people can pay. The more gas and electricity you use, the higher the bill. ""Finding an extra Â£20 a month for energy bills will leave me with a stark choice of paying for either food or fuel,"" says Anthony Lyman of Northampton. The 35-year-old autistic single father of two adds: ""We may have to have a cold house to have a full belly."" Anthony lost his job at a special needs school through ill-health at the start of the pandemic and has since been relying on Universal Credit and help with managing his finances from debt charity Christians Against Poverty, as well as being forced to turn to food banks. ""We've been relying on the Universal Credit uplift money to get by but the prospect of losing that Â£20 a week in October and having to pay more for gas and electricity will leave me on a financial knife-edge."" The energy industry has said there's plenty of help for vulnerable people like Anthony but he says in practice it's almost impossible to get it. ""We haven't been able to get in touch with anybody from our suppliers during the pandemic. You can only seem to talk to a computer and it's very difficult to tell a computer I'm struggling.""

Wholesale prices have risen after gas prices soared to a record high as many economies recovered strongly from the Covid-19 crisis, prompting a surge in demand for energy. When wholesale prices fell last summer following the first lockdown, Ofgem reduced the level of the cap by Â£84 for last winter. But in February it increased the cap by Â£96 as wholesale costs rose. Since then the wholesale cost of energy - which account for 40% of domestic bills - has climbed by more than 50%, which has led to the latest increase. EDF, one of the UK's biggest energy providers, said the ""unprecedented rate"" at which wholesale prices were rising meant that customers would ""at some point see the impact of this global trend"". A spokesman said: ""We know this will be worrying news for customers of all suppliers - we will be directing financial assistance to those most in need through a Â£1.9m support fund, helping customers reduce their bills, manage their debt and even helping with costs for things like more energy efficient white goods."" The industry's trade body, Energy UK, said people worried about their bills should ""pick up the phone and talk to your supplier"". Chief executive Emma Pinchbeck told the BBC's Today radio programme: ""There's help and assistance available, particularly for those that are vulnerable and fuel poor."" She also urged people to consider switching supplier, calling it a ""straightforward"" process. The government also advised people to shop around for the cheapest tariffs, adding that it had simplified the process. A spokesperson for the Business Department said: ""To help consumers further, we plan to trial automatic switching for customers on expensive default tariffs to cheaper deals, and are extending the Warm Home Discount so an extra 750,000 households get Â£150 knocked off their bill each year."" When the energy price cap was introduced three years ago, it was hailed as a shield for customers against unscrupulous energy companies charging sky-high prices. But this October, the cap will rise to its highest ever level, so is it working? The cap applies to a company's default tariff, impacting people who never or rarely change their deal, and also those on pre-payment meters who often have less choice. While it restricted expensive prices at some companies, there have been accusations that the cap gave other firms an excuse to raise their prices up to same level as the cap. When fixing the cap point, the regulator says it must consider the wholesale price of gas and electricity so that companies can still make a profit. That's what they describe as setting a fair price. The result is that we've seen more standardised pricing across energy companies at those top rates, but not necessarily a market that's cheaper for most customers. With many people continuing to work from home through the autumn and winter months, and other budgets already being stretched with reductions to Universal Credit, this big jump in utility bills will be an unwelcome extra pressure. Fuel poverty charities are calling on Ofgem to provide deeper protection for the most vulnerable customers Energy users on variable tariffs could move to a different cheaper deal with their existing supplier or switch to another one to save up to hundreds of pounds. Switching online is relatively simple: just use an energy comparison site and all you'll need is your postcode, the name of your current supplier, and the name of your current tariff. But some vulnerable people may not be able to switch, warns National Energy Action. ""For some customers, switching is impossible due to levels of debt, or because pre-pay customers have far fewer options to switch supplier or tariff,"" added Mr Smith. The charity has called on Ofgem to provide deeper protection for the most vulnerable customers. ""The UK government can also directly help reduce energy arrears as well as maintaining investment to reduce needless energy waste in our homes,"" he said. Energy users can save hundreds by switching to a lower-priced fixed deal. All suppliers have fixed-rate deals, so the simplest way to save is to contact your existing supplier and ask to be moved to its lowest-priced fixed deal. But you could probably save more by switching to a rival, Ofgem says. It's simple to switch using an energy comparison site - all you'll need is your postcode, the name of your current supplier, and the name of your current tariff. Citizens Advice has a useful guide,externalto choosing the right tariff. Ofgem alsosets out the steps you should take to switch energy supplier,externaland shop for a better deal.

"Covid conspiracy theories are worrying medics trying to vaccinate the population Fake news websites about the pandemic need to be shut down, according to a woman who says her parents have been sucked into conspiracy theories. She said her parents initially thought Covid-19 was no worse than the flu, but they soon moved on to more extreme theories. The woman from Cardiff, who is worried about her parents' mental health, has spoken to Newyddion S4C anonymously. One Welsh GP said the anti-vaccination movement was a ""big problem"". This video can not be played 'We need to talk about misleading anti-vax claims' The woman said her parents had found a ""huge community on Twitter and all sorts of other different websites"" to feed their belief in conspiracy theories. The theories include those ""about why Covid exists... that it's either here to control the population or that it's completely fake,"" she said. 'I was a huge believer in anti-vaccine conspiracy theories' What is the anti-vaccination movement? ""One of the conspiracy theories is that the blue disposable masks that people wear has asbestos in them. ""They have theories on every aspect of what's been going on over the past year... and that wasn't part of their life before."" And while the woman has tried to do everything to persuade her parents, she says they still believe false theories about the vaccine. ""It was a shock because it was so unexpected,"" she added. ""They were aware that we didn't share the same attitude so they tried to hide it from us until it went too far. They had convinced themselves that they knew the truth and that we had been brainwashed. ""Their version of reality now is that everyone who gets the vaccine will die in the autumn or if we don't die... at best, we will all have auto-immune diseases. ""Obviously as parents they don't want that to be true but that's what they believe."" How many people have been vaccinated in Wales? Three-quarters of 18 to 29-year-olds get first jab The woman said her parents have not understood how ""cunning"" some people on the internet can be when sharing these lies. She has called for more to be done to close the fake news websites and emphasise the facts in such uncertain times. GP Eilir Hughes says anti-vaxxers are very dismissive when he tries to tell them the facts GP Eilir Hughes, from Nefyn, Gwynedd, who has treated Covid patients throughout the pandemic, is becoming more concerned about the anti-vaccination movement. ""It is a big problem because when we come across these people to try and offer the vaccine to themâ¦ and try and give them the other side - that it's the truth that the vaccine is very useful in preventing serious illness, death and hospital care, they don't want to know,"" he said. ""And very often they can get quite unreasonable in their response. Misinformation is going viral. The information gets to them very often, from other countries, from professional platforms.""

"This video can not be played Lionel Messi: Ten great goals for Barcelona Barcelona say Lionel Messi will not be staying at the club ""because of financial and structural obstacles"". Messi, 34, has been a free agent since 1 July when his contract expired. He agreed a new deal on reduced wages with the club two weeks later, but it was dependent on Barca selling players to afford his salary. ""Both parties deeply regret that the wishes of the player and the club will ultimately not be fulfilled,"" the club said. Is this really the end for Messi at Barcelona? Listen: The Football Daily Podcast breaks down Messi's bombshell announcement Barcelona had said Messi was poised to extend his 21-year association with the club by signing the new deal on Thursday, and blame La Liga for the failure to do so. He had reached an agreement to stay with the Catalan side until 2026 - but La Liga said the club must reduce wages before he and any new players can be registered. ""Despite FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi having reached an agreement and the clear intention of both parties to sign a new contract today, this cannot happen because of financial and structural obstacles [Spanish La Liga regulations],"" the club said. ""FC Barcelona wholeheartedly expresses its gratitude to the player for his contribution to the aggrandisement of the club and wishes him all the very best for the future in his personal and professional life."" This video can not be played Copa America: 'That's what you expect of him' - Messi scores free-kick for Argentina Messi is Barcelona's record scorer with 672 goals and has won 10 La Liga titles, four Champions Leagues and seven Copa del Reys, as well as claiming the Ballon d'Or on a record six occasions. Keeping Messi at the Nou Camp had been president Joan Laporta's top priority this summer. The Barca future of a player who is widely regarded as being one of the world's greatest of all time, however, has been severely complicated by the club's financial problems. The presidential election earlier this year was held against the backdrop ofBarca being on the verge of bankruptcy. The Argentine arguably now becomes the most in-demand player in world football. Messi has long been linked with a move to either Paris St-Germain or Manchester City, where he would be reunited with his former Barcelona boss Pep Guardiola. America's Major League Soccer, which Messi has previously considered experiencing, is another option. The announcement that Messi is to move on comes a year after he sent a fax to Barcelona bosses saying he wished to exercise a clause in his contract that would have allowed him to leave for free last summer. Days laterhe said he would stay,admitting it was ""impossible"" for any team to pay his 700m euro (Â£624m) release clause, which Barca insisted needed to be met. Aged 13 Messi joined Barca's famed La Masia academy in 2000 from Argentine side Newell's Old Boys and made his senior debut aged 16 in 2004. He has gone on to make 778 appearances for the club, scoring 672 goals, including 120 Champions League goals (second behind Cristiano Ronaldo), and a record 474 La Liga goals. He has collected the European Golden Shoe award for the continent's top scorer on six occasions. 25 August 2020- Messi sends a fax to the club saying he wishes toexercise a clause in his contract, allowing him to leave for free with immediate effect. 4 September 2020-Messi says he is staying at Barcelonabecause it is ""impossible"" for any team to pay his 700m euro (Â£624m) release clause, which the club insist would have to be met. 27 October 2020- Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu, who had fallen out with Messi over his failed transfer request,resigns. 28 December 2020- Messi says he hopesto one day play in the United States, but is unsure of his future when his contract runs out. 31 January 2021- Barcelona say they will take ""appropriate legal action"" against Spanish newspaper El Mundo after itpublished details of Messi's contract, worth Â£492m over four years. 16 May 2021- Manager Ronald Koeman says he hopes Messi has not played his final home game for the club after a2-1 defeat by Celta Vigoended their title hopes and meant they finished outside the top two for the first time since 2007-08. 22 May 2021- Paris St-Germain are believed to be""looking closely"" at Messi's contractsituation. 28 May 2021- Barcelona president Joan Laporta says a new contract for Lionel Messi is""not done yet""but that ""things are going well"". 1 July 2021- Messi's Barcelona contract expires and hebecomes a free agent. 15 July 2021-Messi agrees to stay with Barcaon a deal until 2026 that includes reducing his wages. 5 August 2021- Barcelona announce Lionel Messi will leave the club ""because of financial and structural obstacles"".

"Early signs suggest a year of high A-level grades, says a university's head of admissions A-level results next week in England, Wales and Northern Ireland could see high levels of top grades, according to an annual analysis of exam trends. Prof Alan Smithers, at the University of Buckingham, is predicting a ""bumper crop"" of A* and A grades, in results for exams cancelled by the pandemic. But he warns against allowing ""grade inflation"" to become the norm. The University of East Anglia (UEA) is also reporting early signs that it could be a ""record year for grades"". There have been suggestions that if more pupils receive high grades - which are being submitted by teachers for a second year in a row - there will be a crush for places at the most sought-after universities and courses. There is also pressure from record numbers applying, with more than 680,000 seeking university places. Prof Smithers said some universities could consider introducing their own exams to help them choose between students. There have already been reports of oversubscribed medicine courses trying to get applicants to defer for a year -such as at the University of Exeter,where students were offered Â£10,000 to delay. But Richard Harvey, director of admissions at UEA, reassured students that even if grades are higher than last year's record high levels, there is capacity in the university system. What's different with this year's A-levels? Students offered cash to defer medical degree Parents pressure teachers over exam grades Last summer's big exam grades U-turn ""Of course that will cause pressure in certain subjects, mostly medical ones, and in certain universities. At UEA, medicine and related subjects look a bit pressured, but in other subjects I do hope we can continue to welcome people, so I'd encourage people to get in touch,"" he said. Universities get an advance sight of whether applicants have achieved their required grades, and will be going through their admission decisions ahead of the official release of results next week. There is expected to be particular pressure on places for medical and dentistry courses - with a 20% increase in applications and more students expected to get the required grades this year. The Department for Education says it will create more places and flexibility - allowing ""over 9,000 places"" - but with no fixed numbers for an increase. Last year, there was an intake of almost 9,300 for these medicine and dentistry courses. Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was much harder to create more places for medicine because of the high cost of training doctors, the length of the course and the need for hospital placements. Mr Hillman said he was ""a little bit uncomfortable"" with the suggestion that students could be asked if they wanted to shift to other medical schools with more capacity. ""If you've had your sights set on one particular medical school from the moment you applied or even the moment you started your A-levels, it's quite a big mental jump to decide you're going to go somewhere else,"" he said. This will be the second year in which results will be decided without pupils taking the usual set of exam papers. Schools submitted grades for pupils, based on a range of evidence, including mini-exams, mock exams and coursework, and next week will see the final results issued by exam boards. Last year saw huge controversy after an initial downgrading of many pupils' grades - which was then reversed in a U-turn which saw the highest-ever proportion of A* and A grades. Almost two in five A-levels, 38.5%, were awarded an A* or A last year after the U-turn, up from 25.5% for pupils in 2019. Prof Smithers,in his annual pre-results report,,externalsuggests results are once again going to be very high, or even higher, to compensate for the disruption facing pupils. ""While logically there is no reason why A-level standards should not be restored to what they were in 2019, my fear is that the various pressures will cause the government to allow what they became in 2020 to stand,"" he said. He warned that issuing so many top grades makes it hard for universities to distinguish between students. ""Leading universities could be forced to set their own tests to help them distinguish between the many prospective students awarded straight As,"" said Prof Smithers. But Prof Graham Galbraith, vice chancellor of the University of Portsmouth, rejected the focus on grade inflation. ""These young people have had a very difficult time since March 2020. How their grades compare with other years is of secondary importance. We should prioritise this year's students and treat this year as the extreme exception it obviously is,"" he said. Tom Middlehurst, of the ASCL head teachers' union, said speculation about grades was ""unhelpful"" and said that if grades were higher this year ""it would be a reflection of the system devised by the government and [regulator] Ofqual"" rather than a decision by teachers. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson, promising extra places for medical courses, said: ""Students have worked incredibly hard over the past 18 months and we have continued to put their best interests first to ensure they can progress on to the next stage of their education training or career.""

"Another woman has been sexually harassed in hotel quarantine despite new rules designed to prevent it. Last month the government said female guests would get female guards. However, Lorna Farmer, 28, walked out of the Hilton Garden Inn at Birmingham airport a week ago, after a guard offered to ""entertain"" her in her room. The Department of Health and Social Care now says it will introduce a new phone line for women to report harassment confidentially. Eighteen women have now reported harassment to the BBC - two of them since the DHSC took steps to fix the problem in July. The new measures included a new dedicated complaints system and extra training for guards on how to behave around lone women, as well as the plan for women to be supervised by female guards ""when available"". Lorna Farmer says, however, that she was only escorted outside on exercise breaks by male guards. She says she began receiving unwanted attention from a security guard employed by the company, Mitie, soon after arriving at the Hilton Garden Inn on Sunday 25 July. He asked to see her in her pyjamas, and asked to enter her room, she says - knocking repeatedly on her door and sometimes sitting on the floor outside it. Travellers arriving from countries on the UK's red list have to quarantine for 10 full days in designated hotels Nearly 124,000 people had been through the system by mid-July The cost is Â£1,750 for a single adult,rising to Â£2,285 on 12 August,external, and includes Covid tests on days two and eight Guests must stay in their room at all times except when escorted outside by guards for exercise - food is delivered to the room and guests do their own cleaning Security companies are hired by the government - the maximum value of Mitie's contract from February to October is Â£19.6m, the maximum value of G4s's is Â£66.5m What are the rules for travelling to green, amber and red-list countries? On one occasion, when she was cleaning her room, he said: ""Why don't you put that Hoover down and I'll come in and entertain you."" Ms Farmer says he repeated this another five times within the space of 10 minutes. When she complained to the head of the security team in the hotel, from the company Mitie, the guard was removed. But Ms Farmer says a different guard had also made lewd comments to female guests during their exercise break, so she still felt unsafe and got her father to come and drive her home. She then reported the harassment to police in Northamptonshire, where she is from. Mitie said: ""Should a complaint be raised by a guest a full investigation is carried out. In this case, the investigation found that the officer had not followed our procedures and therefore is no longer working on the contract."" Asked whether he was still working for Mitie, and whether he might now be working at a different quarantine hotel, a spokesperson said she could not share personal information about staff. Lorna Farmer's first quarantine hotel, the Hilton Garden Inn at Birmingham airport The Hilton Garden Inn emphasised that security firms were contracted by the DHSC and fell outside its responsibility. The DHSC said: ""Sexual harassment or abuse is completely unacceptable and totally abhorrent. We take all such allegations extremely seriously and we expect providers to take firm action - including suspending staff or reporting them to the police where appropriate - as has happened in this case."" It said the new confidential reporting line for lone female guests would be staffed by recently retired and trained police officers. Another woman, who is still in quarantine, says that a male security guard knocked on her door twice in one evening, giving a transparently bogus reason for wanting to talk to her. She said she was not reporting the incident because she felt unsafe and was not leaving her room. Women say they were sexually harassed by guards Women in hotel quarantine to get female guards Ms Farmer told the BBC that when she went outside for exercise at the Hilton Garden Inn, she was always escorted by a single male guard, despite the DHSC's intention that lone female guests should get female guards. Three other women quarantining since the rule change have told the BBC that they too had male guards. Others have said that they have mostly had female guards, though one added that ""once you're outside it's like being a walking exhibit with male guards sitting all around the parking lot like it's a gallery and looking you up and down as you walk"". In July, the government said that if female guards were unavailable, lone women should be escorted by two male guards, ""with each guard chaperoning the other to ensure appropriate behaviour"". This idea was sharply criticised by some women's safety campaigners and, judging from the reports of women in quarantine, appears to have been rarely adopted in practice. Lorna Farmer's second quarantine hotel, the Crowne Plaza NEC After walking out of the Hilton Garden Inn on Friday and spending the weekend at home, Lorna Farmer was called on Tuesday by an official who told her that West Midlands Police were looking for her, and that she could be arrested and fined Â£10,000 if she didn't return to quarantine. She says she felt very uneasy when two men then arrived in a van with darkened windows to accompany her to another quarantine hotel, the Crowne Plaza NEC. Here she was escorted outside for exercise by a female security guard, but says she only saw male guards on her corridor. Mitie says there was a female guard on her floor at all times, and that at least two female officers were always on shift at each hotel, in line with DHSC guidance. The company added that it was taking active steps to increase the number of female officers working in quarantine hotels. According to the Security Industry Authority only 10% of licenced security guards in the UK are women. Carry a door wedgeor jammer in case your door doesn't have a second lock. These should prevent anyone entering, even if they have a master key. Always use the peep hole or door chain before opening the door to anybody. Identify the security companyat your quarantine hotel and find emergency contact details - eg whistleblower numbers on their website. Note names, ID numbers or identifying features of anyone harassing you. Save notes and approaches via social media. Report the incident if and when you feel safe to do so. Be an allyif you see others being harassed. This may include recording the incident, taking notes, asking if the victim needs help, calling out the bad behaviour or reporting it. Speak to a loved one- when you're afraid, you may be less able to process events logically. A loved one may help you assess the situation and decide on the safest course of action, which may be to call the emergency services. Carolyn Pearson, founder of Maiden-Voyage.com Ms Farmer says she thinks it is ""ridiculous"" for lone women to be forced to quarantine in hotels when their safety cannot be guaranteed. ""The woman from public health said, 'Lorna, are you aware that West Midlands Police are looking for you, that they've put you down as absconded?' I was like, 'No, I spoke to Northamptonshire Police and reported everything that's happened, and they are absolutely happy with me being home.' ""And she was like, 'You have to come back today, otherwise we will come and get you and you'll be prosecuted and fined.' And I was like, 'Are you serious? After everything that's happened?'"" Ms Farmer was allowed to leave the hotel on Thursday, 11 days after she arrived in the UK from Dubai. West Midlands Victims' Commissioner Nicky Brennan said she was ""disgusted"" to hear how women were being treated by security staff in quarantine hotels. ""The government who have given the contract and the security company need to investigate the practices, training and conduct of staff with urgency. People who are quarantining in hotels at the orders of the government should not have to feel unsafe when following those rules. ""This would appear to be a problem across the country with security staff in these hotels. It's worrying for anybody, especially lone women that they could be treated in this way. They should not be put in this position by a government which is meant to be keeping them safe.""

"The prime minister and transport secretary have defended changes to the UK's traffic light travel system, as an airline has scheduled extra flights to return Britons from red-listed Mexico. Up to 6,000 British tourists are currently in the country, and those who want to avoid quarantine will need to return before 04:00 BST on Sunday. The changewas announced on Wednesday. Grant Shapps said a new plan to review restrictions every three weeks will make for a ""simplified system"". Boris Johnson said that the government wanted people to be able to travel but had to balance that desire with the ""need to protect us against new variants"". Asked whether he would book a holiday to Spain, the prime minister said the government was trying to make travel as simple as possible by lengthening the gap between changes to guidance. Transport secretary Mr Shapps said this meant people would be able to travel ""without looking over their shoulders"". The travel list changes apply for passengers returning to England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. TheWelsh government said on Thursday evening that it would follow the changes, due to sharing an open border with England, but said it was ""extremely disappointed"" and would continue to advise against non-essential international travel. Countries have their own rules about allowing visitors - so being on the UK's green list does not guarantee travellers can visit.

On Thursday, Mr Shapps sought to reassure British holidaymakers that the traffic light system would now be reviewed every three weeks - compared with once a week last summer and more recent ad-hoc changes - because of the number of people in the UK and abroad who are fully vaccinated against Covid-19. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I hope people will be able to go away under this simplified system, enjoy their breaks and not be looking over their shoulders the whole time."" Mr Shapps said that between 5,000 and 6,000 British holidaymakers are in Mexico currently and would be ""making arrangements to come home"". From 12 August, the cost of hotel quarantine will increase, with the price for single adult travellers rising from Â£1,750 to Â£2,285 and a second adult paying Â£1,430. The government has said this better reflects the costs involved, including transport, security and PCR tests. Children aged 5-12 will still cost Â£325; it is free for children aged under five. British Airways said its teams had been ""working through the night"" to arrange additional seats out of Mexico and had added four additional flights to London over the next three days, as well as rearranging another flight to land ahead of the deadline. It said customers could re-book their flights from Mexico ""at no additional cost"" ahead of the deadline. Robin and Viv Silverthorne, from Worthing in Sussex, were flying to Cancun, Mexico, yesterday when they found out mid-air that the country was being placed on the red list. Robin says the couple spent hours on the phone trying to speak to their airline ""without success"" before making the decision to come home after just a day to avoid paying for a quarantine hotel. He told the BBC: ""It's not just us, there was a plane full of holidaymakers in the same boat, some with children who will now have to pay thousands to quarantine on return. ""We have only just secured a return flight via Miami tomorrow. We have essentially paid a total of Â£8,000 for a day trip to Mexico."" He says the couple had done their research and just wanted a ""nice holiday"" - but that the latest changes to the rules had left Viv in tears. Also in Mexico are Claudia Rattray and her daughters Ivana and Summer who travelled to Mexico City to visit her family only to find out that the country had been added to the red list when they arrived. ""I decided to enjoy the time here with my family and I am going to see if in three weeks the government reviews this list,"" she said. ""But I think if not I am going to stay here in Mexico because I can't afford to pay for a quarantine hotel."" She added that they were lucky that they were staying with family and so had the option of staying for longer. Asked about the advice on PCR tests for arrivals from Spain, Mr Shapps insisted the government was ""not changing the rules"", as in Spain's case, ""virtually everyone is taking a PCR"" to meet the government's performance standards for the pre-departure test. But in aseries of tweets,externalConservative MP Huw Merriman, chairman of the Commons Transport Select Committee, said PCR tests for travel were an ""unnecessary rip-off"" and a ""barrier to affordable travel"". Mr Shapps also said he believes full vaccination will be increasingly important for future travel. ""Most countries, probably all countries, will require full vaccination in order for you to enter"", he said. Labour's shadow transport secretary Jim McMahon criticised the government for ""flip-flopping over France"" and reiterated calls for data upon which travel list decisions are made to be published. Grant Shapps told the Today Programme that the government's advice to those returning to the UK from Spain to use a PCR test as their pre-departure test wherever possible, was ""not actually a change"". This does not appear to be the case. The existing guidance applying to Spain tells people returning to the UK that they need to take a private test in the three days before travelling. The guidance says that could be a PCR test or a (cheaper) lateral flow test as long as it meets UK requirements. Many travellers order a lateral flow test in the UK and take it with them to use in Spain. The travel operator Tui told Reality Check that more than 90% of its customers buy a package with their holiday that includes that sort of test. Mr Shapps also said that ""virtually everyone is taking a PCR"" to meet the government's performance standards for the pre-departure test. But we've spoken to several people who have used lateral flow tests in Spain in recent weeks and had no trouble using them to return to the UK. If you have been in a red list country in the last 10 days, you can only enter the UK ifyou are a UK or Irish national or UK resident, and you must stay at a quarantine hotel on your return. The total number of countries or territorieson the green list,external- from which all travellers can return without having to quarantine - rises from 29 to 36 when the changes come into effect. The UK government sets the red, amber and green lists for England, while the other nations are in charge of their own lists. The travel industry has welcomed France's addition to the amber list but trade association Abta said the speed at which countries were being added to the green list was at a ""snail's pace"", with the seven added not being traditional holiday destinations. BA boss Sean Doyle said that the UK's travel sector was ""lagging behind Europe"" due to ""more stringent testing requirements"" and a red list ""significantly broader than our European peers"". Industry body Airlines UK has warned ""tens of thousands of jobs are at stake"" as it called for the furlough scheme to be extended. The government acknowledged it was a difficult time for the sector but said it was providing ""an unprecedented package of support"".

"Jack Grealish's move to Manchester City makes him the ninth-most expensive player in history Manchester City have signed England midfielder Jack Grealish from Aston Villa for a British record Â£100m. The 25-year-old joins the Premier League champions on a six-year contract and will wear the number 10 shirt recently vacated by Sergio Aguero. The fee surpasses the Â£89m Manchester United paid to re-sign midfielder Paul Pogba from Juventus in 2016. ""City are the best team in the country with a manager considered to be the best in the world,"" said Grealish. ""It's a dream come true to be part of this club."" The move makes Grealish the ninth most expensive footballer in history. He could make his debut for Pep Guardiola's side in Saturday's Community Shield against Leicester City at Wembley. Villa 'hoped' Grealish Â£100m release clause would never be met Where does Grealish fit in at Man City? Quiz: Name the past 13 players to go for a British transfer record A boyhood Villa fan, Grealish joined the club aged six and made 213 appearances in all competitions, scoring 32 goals. He said: ""It was obviously a difficult few months because I have been an Aston Villa fan for my whole life, but when I spoke to the manager here and you see what type of players they have got here, in the end it was something I couldn't say no to. ""Competing for major trophies is something that I wanted to do. It was something I couldn't turn down. ""Playing in the Champions League was a massive thing for me, I haven't done that yet. When I was sitting there on a Tuesday or Wednesday night last year it was just what I wanted to do. To be able to do it with this club is going to be a dream. ""I had a long chat with [Pep Guardiola] about positions and stuff like that, all football. It was such a positive chat and shows why I want to play under him. ""The way this team is set up to play suits me down to a tee, the way the manager likes to play suits me."" How would you get Grealish in the team?

""Jack wanted to be certain if at any point a Champions League club came in for him and Aston Villa were not in the competition we would not stand in his way,"" said Purslow. ""For that reason, we agreed to incorporate a so-called release clause. We set the value at a level we hope would not be met, but reflected his true value to Villa.""Manchester City said they would be willing to pay Â£100m to trigger the clause.

He made his Villa debut in a 4-0 defeat by City in May 2014 and made 17 Premier League appearances during the 2014-15 season as Villa finished one place above the relegation zone. During the following season, he scored his first top-flight goal against Leicester City in September 2015 and made 16 league appearances as Villa finished bottom and were relegated to the Championship. Villa spent three seasons in the Championship before Grealish helped them regain their Premier League status with a play-off final win against Derby County. He made 36 Premier League appearances during 2019-20 and scored eight goals, including one in the1-1 draw against West Ham Unitedwhich secured Villa's top-flight survival on the final day of a season interrupted by the coronavirus pandemic. A Republic of Ireland Under-21 international, Grealish announced in 2015 that he wanted to represent England. Having switched to their Under-21 side, he made his senior England debut in a goalless draw against Denmark in September 2020. Jack Grealish's stats for Aston Villa during the 2020-21 Premier League season Last season, Grealish scored six goals in 26 Premier League appearances, including two in a 7-2 win over Liverpool, as Villa finished 11th. He spent three months out injured from mid-February to mid-May but his return just before the end of the campaign saw him selected in England manager Gareth Southgate's squad for Euro 2020. Grealish impressed in warm-up wins against Austria and Romania and made one start and four substitute appearances, registering two assists, for England during the tournament. (Premier League 2020-21 season) Aston Villa with Grealish Aston Villa without Grealish Games 26 12 Win % 50% 25% Goals for 42 13 Goals against 29 17 Points per game 1.7 1.0 Analysis by BBC Sport's Simon Stone For all the nudges about Manchester City's spending and the questions about how the club manages to do deals like this one without falling foul of profit and sustainability rules, it is worth noting they are now responsible for the biggest single purchase by an English club during their Abu Dhabi ownership for only the second time. The first occasion was that never-to-be-forgotten night in 2008 when Sheikh Mansour went on an elaborate sweep of available players to prove he was a man to be taken seriously and spent Â£50m on Brazil striker Robinho. In the same period, Manchester United have held the record seven times. It is United's Â£89m purchase of Paul Pogba in 2016 that the Grealish deal has overtaken. Of City's 'big six' rivals, only Tottenham have not invested a significant sum in an individual player during the pandemic - although United and Chelsea are the only clubs that can truly be argued to have spent such high sums so consistently over so many seasons. There is a book-balancing exercise going on as well. Including Leroy Sane's exit for Bayern Munich last summer and the Â£11m they received as a sell-on payment from Borussia Dortmund's sale of Jadon Sancho to Manchester United, City sources argue the club has already raised Â£109.5m over the past 12 months - with - potentially - another Â£55m to come through sales of younger players. This does not include the exit of high-earning Sergio Aguero to Barcelona, nor the potential sales of bigger names before the transfer window closes, the most likely of which is Bernardo Silva, who wants to move to Spain. On the basis that some clubs will always have more money than others, some may wonder why this is important anyway. However, given their recent skirmish with Uefa over Financial Fair Play, it is understandable why City are sensitive when it comes to their finances. Evidently though, the club is in a different place to 20 years ago, when they were trying to re-invent themselves under Kevin Keegan. Back then their idea of a big name was Eyal Berkovic, who joined them from Celtic for Â£1.5m. Find all the latest football transferson our dedicated page.

"Job starting salaries are rising at record rates due to shortages in candidates, according to KPMG. Rising demand for staff to fill vacancies resulted in the sharpest salary inflation rate in almost 24 years of data collection, its jobs survey found. However, ongoing uncertainty over job security concerns caused a ""severe drop"" in candidates in July, it said. Candidate numbers fell at the second-fastest rate in the survey's history. The lack of available candidates continued to decline rapidly in July, driven by ""concerns over job security due to the pandemic, a lack of European workers due to Brexit, and a generally low unemployment rate"", the report by KPMG and the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) said. The BBC has approached the Home Office for comment. Job vacancies soar as skills shortage bites Restaurants struggle for staff ahead of reopening Claire Warnes, partner and head of education, skills and productivity at KPMG UK, said job seekers should be ""taking advantage"" of the bounce in salaries for new recruits. Companies were wanting to invest in their businesses now coronavirus restrictions had been eased but demand for new staff outstripped supply, she added. ""We know that reskilling and upskilling is needed to help people move between sectors, and there's no doubt the 'pingdemic' has added an extra dimension to the recruitment challenge,"" said Ms Warnes. ""Plus, with furlough due to end soon, there may be a downward pressure on pay to come."" Kate Shoesmith, deputy chief executive of the REC, said the data confirmed that it was now a ""good time to be looking for a new job"". ""Employers are desperate to find good candidates for the many jobs on offer and this is reflected in starting salaries rising at the sharpest rate since the survey began in 1997,"" she said. ""This will likely motivate more people to be on the lookout for new opportunities. The same goes for those on temporary contracts which are also seeing increased pay."" Several industries, including the hospitality and haulage sectors, are experiencing chronic shortages in workers. Some of the many skilled jobs in short supply include chefs, software engineers, technicians and carers. The report found latest vacancy data indicated faster increases in demand for both permanent and temporary workers in July. The report said the removal of Covid restrictions had led to a ""sharp increase"" in the number of people employed into permanent job roles, while the upturn in temporary vacancies was the steepest since November 1997. July survey data signalled an upturn in demand for temporary workers as well. So-called ""blue collar"" workers remained at the top of the rankings, followed closely by hotel and catering staff. Jobs in IT and computing, hotel and catering and engineering were in high demand for permanent roles, while retail vacancies were the least in demand. In the private sector, demand for permanent staff expanded at a slightly quicker pace than for temporary workers. In contrast, short-term vacancies rose more quickly than permanent roles in the public sector. However, Ms Shoesmith warned pay increases alone won't meet the demand built up over recent months. ""We need an immigration system that flexes to meet demand as was promised, and business and government need a long-term plan for skilling up workers,"" she said.

"Another woman has been sexually harassed in hotel quarantine despite new rules designed to prevent it. Last month the government said female guests would get female guards. However, Lorna Farmer, 28, walked out of the Hilton Garden Inn at Birmingham airport a week ago, after a guard offered to ""entertain"" her in her room. The Department of Health and Social Care now says it will introduce a new phone line for women to report harassment confidentially. Eighteen women have now reported harassment to the BBC - two of them since the DHSC took steps to fix the problem in July. The new measures included a new dedicated complaints system and extra training for guards on how to behave around lone women, as well as the plan for women to be supervised by female guards ""when available"". Lorna Farmer says, however, that she was only escorted outside on exercise breaks by male guards. She says she began receiving unwanted attention from a security guard employed by the company, Mitie, soon after arriving at the Hilton Garden Inn on Sunday 25 July. He asked to see her in her pyjamas, and asked to enter her room, she says - knocking repeatedly on her door and sometimes sitting on the floor outside it. Travellers arriving from countries on the UK's red list have to quarantine for 10 full days in designated hotels Nearly 124,000 people had been through the system by mid-July The cost is Â£1,750 for a single adult,rising to Â£2,285 on 12 August,external, and includes Covid tests on days two and eight Guests must stay in their room at all times except when escorted outside by guards for exercise - food is delivered to the room and guests do their own cleaning Security companies are hired by the government - the maximum value of Mitie's contract from February to October is Â£19.6m, the maximum value of G4s's is Â£66.5m What are the rules for travelling to green, amber and red-list countries? On one occasion, when she was cleaning her room, he said: ""Why don't you put that Hoover down and I'll come in and entertain you."" Ms Farmer says he repeated this another five times within the space of 10 minutes. When she complained to the head of the security team in the hotel, from the company Mitie, the guard was removed. But Ms Farmer says a different guard had also made lewd comments to female guests during their exercise break, so she still felt unsafe and got her father to come and drive her home. She then reported the harassment to police in Northamptonshire, where she is from. Mitie said: ""Should a complaint be raised by a guest a full investigation is carried out. In this case, the investigation found that the officer had not followed our procedures and therefore is no longer working on the contract."" Asked whether he was still working for Mitie, and whether he might now be working at a different quarantine hotel, a spokesperson said she could not share personal information about staff. Lorna Farmer's first quarantine hotel, the Hilton Garden Inn at Birmingham airport The Hilton Garden Inn emphasised that security firms were contracted by the DHSC and fell outside its responsibility. The DHSC said: ""Sexual harassment or abuse is completely unacceptable and totally abhorrent. We take all such allegations extremely seriously and we expect providers to take firm action - including suspending staff or reporting them to the police where appropriate - as has happened in this case."" It said the new confidential reporting line for lone female guests would be staffed by recently retired and trained police officers. Another woman, who is still in quarantine, says that a male security guard knocked on her door twice in one evening, giving a transparently bogus reason for wanting to talk to her. She said she was not reporting the incident because she felt unsafe and was not leaving her room. Women say they were sexually harassed by guards Women in hotel quarantine to get female guards Ms Farmer told the BBC that when she went outside for exercise at the Hilton Garden Inn, she was always escorted by a single male guard, despite the DHSC's intention that lone female guests should get female guards. Three other women quarantining since the rule change have told the BBC that they too had male guards. Others have said that they have mostly had female guards, though one added that ""once you're outside it's like being a walking exhibit with male guards sitting all around the parking lot like it's a gallery and looking you up and down as you walk"". In July, the government said that if female guards were unavailable, lone women should be escorted by two male guards, ""with each guard chaperoning the other to ensure appropriate behaviour"". This idea was sharply criticised by some women's safety campaigners and, judging from the reports of women in quarantine, appears to have been rarely adopted in practice. Lorna Farmer's second quarantine hotel, the Crowne Plaza NEC After walking out of the Hilton Garden Inn on Friday and spending the weekend at home, Lorna Farmer was called on Tuesday by an official who told her that West Midlands Police were looking for her, and that she could be arrested and fined Â£10,000 if she didn't return to quarantine. She says she felt very uneasy when two men then arrived in a van with darkened windows to accompany her to another quarantine hotel, the Crowne Plaza NEC. Here she was escorted outside for exercise by a female security guard, but says she only saw male guards on her corridor. Mitie says there was a female guard on her floor at all times, and that at least two female officers were always on shift at each hotel, in line with DHSC guidance. The company added that it was taking active steps to increase the number of female officers working in quarantine hotels. According to the Security Industry Authority only 10% of licenced security guards in the UK are women. Carry a door wedgeor jammer in case your door doesn't have a second lock. These should prevent anyone entering, even if they have a master key. Always use the peep hole or door chain before opening the door to anybody. Identify the security companyat your quarantine hotel and find emergency contact details - eg whistleblower numbers on their website. Note names, ID numbers or identifying features of anyone harassing you. Save notes and approaches via social media. Report the incident if and when you feel safe to do so. Be an allyif you see others being harassed. This may include recording the incident, taking notes, asking if the victim needs help, calling out the bad behaviour or reporting it. Speak to a loved one- when you're afraid, you may be less able to process events logically. A loved one may help you assess the situation and decide on the safest course of action, which may be to call the emergency services. Carolyn Pearson, founder of Maiden-Voyage.com Ms Farmer says she thinks it is ""ridiculous"" for lone women to be forced to quarantine in hotels when their safety cannot be guaranteed. ""The woman from public health said, 'Lorna, are you aware that West Midlands Police are looking for you, that they've put you down as absconded?' I was like, 'No, I spoke to Northamptonshire Police and reported everything that's happened, and they are absolutely happy with me being home.' ""And she was like, 'You have to come back today, otherwise we will come and get you and you'll be prosecuted and fined.' And I was like, 'Are you serious? After everything that's happened?'"" Ms Farmer was allowed to leave the hotel on Thursday, 11 days after she arrived in the UK from Dubai. West Midlands Victims' Commissioner Nicky Brennan said she was ""disgusted"" to hear how women were being treated by security staff in quarantine hotels. ""The government who have given the contract and the security company need to investigate the practices, training and conduct of staff with urgency. People who are quarantining in hotels at the orders of the government should not have to feel unsafe when following those rules. ""This would appear to be a problem across the country with security staff in these hotels. It's worrying for anybody, especially lone women that they could be treated in this way. They should not be put in this position by a government which is meant to be keeping them safe.""
