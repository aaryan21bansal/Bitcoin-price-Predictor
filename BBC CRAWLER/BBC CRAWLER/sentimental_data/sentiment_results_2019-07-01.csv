"An area of Amazon rainforest roughly the size of a football pitch is now being cleared every single minute, according to satellite data. The rate of losses has accelerated as Brazil's new right-wing president favours development over conservation. The largest rainforest in the world, the Amazon is a vital carbon store that slows down the pace of global warming. A senior Brazilian official, speaking anonymously, told us his government was encouraging deforestation. Usually by bulldozers, either pushing against the trunks to force the shallow roots out of the ground, or by a pair of the machines advancing with a chain between them. In one vast stretch of recently cleared land, we found giant trees lying on their sides, much of the foliage still green and patches of bare earth drying under a fierce sun. Later, the timber will be cleared and sold or burned, and the land prepared for farming. In other areas, illegal loggers carve new tracks through the undergrowth to reach particularly valuable hardwood trees which they sell on the black market, often to order. Satellite images show a sharp increase in clearances of trees over the first half of this year, since Jair Bolsonaro became president of Brazil, the country that owns most of the Amazon region. The most recent analysis suggests a staggering scale of losses over the past two months in particular, with about a hectare being cleared every minute on average. The single biggest reason to fell trees, according to official figures, is to create new pastures for cattle, and during our visit we saw countless herds grazing on land that used to be rainforest. Over the past decade, previous governments had managed to reduce the clearances with concerted action by federal agencies and a system of fines. But this approach is being overturned by Mr Bolsonaro and his ministers who have criticised the penalties and overseen a dramatic fall in confiscations of timber and convictions for environmental crimes. The forest holds a vast amount of carbon in its billions of trees, accumulated over hundreds or even thousands of years. Every year, the leaves also absorb a huge quantity of carbon dioxide that would otherwise be left in the atmosphere adding to the rise in global temperatures. Jair Bolsonaro swept to power on a populist agenda By one recent estimate, the trees of the Amazon rainforest pulled in carbon dioxide equivalent to the fossil fuel emissions of most of the nine countries that own or border the forest between 1980-2010. The forest is also the richest home to biodiversity on the planet, a habitat for perhaps one-tenth of all species of plants and animals. And it is where one million indigenous people live, hunting and gathering amid the trees. According to a senior Brazilian environment official, the impact is so ""huge"" that he took the risk of giving us an unauthorised interview to bring it to the attention of the world. We had to meet in secret and disguise his face and voice because Mr Bolsonaro has banned his environment staff from talking to the media. Over the course of three hours, a startling inside picture emerged of small, under-resourced teams of government experts passionate about saving the forest but seriously undermined by their own political masters. Farming organisations argue that the network of protected areas of forest is too restrictive Mr Bolsonaro swept to power on a populist agenda backed by agricultural businesses and small farmers, many of whom believe that too much of the Amazon region is protected and that environment staff have too much influence. He has said he wants to weaken the laws protecting the forest and has attacked the civil servants whose job it is to guard the trees. The result, according to the environment official, is that ""it feels like we are the enemies of the Amazon, when in fact we should be seen in a completely different way, as the people trying to protect our ecological heritage for future generations"". ""They don't want us to speak because we'll say the truth, that conservation areas are being invaded and destroyed, there are many people marking out areas that should be protected."" The official believes the figures for deforestation could be even worse than officially recognised. ""There's a government attempt to show the data is wrong, to show the numbers don't portray the reality,"" he told me. Ministers are considering hiring an independent contractor to handle information from satellite images of the region, questioning the work of the current government agency. One million indigenous people live in the forest Also, the rainy season is only now coming to an end, and because deforestation typically takes place in the drier months of the year, the official fears that the pace of losses could pick up speed. ""In truth, it can be even worse,"" he said, because many of the areas recently damaged haven't yet been picked up by satellite images. ""People need to know what's happening because we need allies to fight against invasions, to protect areas, and against deforestation."" We made repeated requests for interviews with the ministers for environment and agriculture but were refused. Earlier this year, Mr Bolsonaro, who's known as the ""Trump of the Tropics"", invited the US president to be a partner in exploiting the resources of the Amazon. Last month, in an interview with BBC Brasil, the environment minister Ricardo Salles, said landowners should be rewarded for preserving forest and that developed nations should foot the bill. And there's an assertive response when voices in the outside world call for the forest to be saved. The president's top security adviser, General Augusto Heleno Pereira, told Bloomberg last month that it was ""nonsense"" that the Amazon was part of the world's heritage. ""The Amazon is Brazilian, the heritage of Brazil and should be dealt with by Brazil for the benefit of Brazil,"" he said. For decades, farming organisations have argued that the network of protected areas of forest, including reserves for indigenous people, is too restrictive for a developing country that needs to create jobs. A leading figure in the farmers' union  in the city of Santarem, a hub for soya and cattle, told me that other countries had cleared their trees for agriculture but now wanted Brazil not to do the same. Vanderley Wegner said that the US and Europe, which buy produce from the Amazon region, have far less stringent controls on their forests, and that Europe ""has very little forest left"" anyway. ""We have to develop the Amazon. More than four million people live here and they need development too, it's a constitutional right of every Brazilian citizen,"" he said.

"Councils have a legal duty to provide a range of services, including waste collection Councils in England and Wales have warned they are ""completely in the dark"" about how much money they will get from central government next year. The Local Government Association says councils need ""urgent guarantees"" they will get enough to provide key services like child protection and social care. More than 90 of its members fear they will run out of money to meet their legal obligations within five years. Ministers said councils had been given extra funding for vulnerable residents. The Department for Housing, Communities and Local Government said total funding for local authorities had gone up by nearly 3% this year to Â£46.4bn, with an extra Â£650m to help councils provide care for the elderly. The recent cash crisis at Northamptonshire County Council - which is to be scrapped and replaced by two separate new authorities - has highlighted the financial plight facing local government. Ahead of the start of the LGA's annual conference in Bournemouth on Tuesday, council leaders have warned the future financial viability of other local authorities is in doubt. Increasing demand on councils for adult social care and children's services meant likely cuts elsewhere, the body - which represents more than 300 councils - warned. A guide to England's 'worst run' council Reality Check: What do councils have to do? English councils 'face Â£50bn funding gap' Nearly 50 councils have told the organisation they may not be able to fund services they are legally obliged to provide - such as care for the elderly, shelter for homeless people, bin collections and libraries - by 2022-3. A further 40 or so councils fear they will run out of money to properly fulfil their legal duties by 2024-5. The annual funding councils get from government each year has fallen 49% in real terms since 2010. In 2016, councils agreed a four-year financial settlement with the government, giving them greater financial freedom in return for shouldering more responsibility for care provision and hitting efficiency targets. But hopes many councils would become virtually self-funding by the end of the decade, by allowing them to retain up to 75% of the business rates they charge on High Street shops, have proved optimistic as financial pressure on their core services has grown more acute. According to the LGA, the funding ""gap"" facing local government is set to rise from an estimated Â£3.1bn next year to Â£8bn by 2024-5 unless urgent action is taken. Lord Porter, the outgoing chair of the organisation, said the situation was not helped by uncertainty over Brexit and the Conservative leadership. James Brokenshire has insisted government is listening to councils' concerns The Conservative peer, who will step down this week, said whoever succeeds Theresa May in Downing Street must make the financial sustainability of councils their top priority in the government's Spending Review due in the autumn. ""Councils would normally have started their budget-setting planning process but remain completely in the dark about how much funding they will have next year,"" he said. ""Communities relying on the vital local services that make a difference to their lives deserve better. ""Urgent guarantees are needed that councils will have the funding they need to ensure our vital public services survive the uncertainty ahead."" At the very least, he said ministers must confirm the continuation of key funding programs, such as the Better Care Fund, worth Â£1.8bn this year. He also called again on local authorities to be able to raise council taxes by whatever amount they felt necessary without having to get the consent of residents through a referendum if increases were deemed excessive. Both Tory leadership contenders, Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson, have pledged more money for social care although this could be put in doubt by a no-deal Brexit. The government is currently consulting on local authorities' changing financial needs and resources, the outcome of which is likely to influence future funding settlements. Communities Secretary James Brokenshire has said ministers recognise the financial pressure on councils and have sought to meet their demands for more resources. These include Â£4.3bn in ring-fenced resources for adult social care this year, Â£100m to end rough sleeping and nearly Â£60m to help councils prepare for the UK's departure from the EU. In a statement, the department said councils had received nearly Â£200bn over the past four years and their future needs would be considered in the Spending Review. ""Ultimately councils are responsible for managing their own resources and we are working with local government to develop a funding system for the future,"" it said.

"The S&P 500 index of US stocks has closed at a record high amid signs of progress in US-China trade talks. The index closed at 2,964.33, beating 21 June's previous high, with technology stocks driving the rise. Market watchers say more optimism around a potential trade deal between the US and China led to the movement. And gold, often seen as a safe asset in times of uncertainty, fell 2% to $1,382 per ounce, the biggest drop since June 2018. The Dow Jones closed 0.44% higher at 26,717.43, while the Nasdaq finished 1.1% higher at 8,091.16. In Europe, both the UK's FTSE 100 index and Germany's Dax closed 1% higher. ""We're right back on track,"" US President Donald Trump said after the countries agreed to restart trade talks. US and China agree to restart trade talks A quick guide to the US-China trade war ""Gold tends to do well during times of concern over growth, market volatility or when markets think the powers-that-be are losing control of events,"" said Russ Mould, investment director at stockbroker AJ Bell. ""A trade deal would deal with all three issues and markets are happy to take the view that a deal is coming. Though it could still be a long time coming, if there is to be one at all."" Negotiations between China and the US have dominated market moves for months as positive statements are often followed by extra tariffs, sending stock, currency and commodity markets up and down. The latest moves follow a pledge to renew talks between the US and China, an agreement that was reached at the G20 summit in Japan. US President Donald Trump agreed to hold off on $300bn of new tariffs on goods and relaxed restrictions on Huawei, while China agreed to make new purchases of US farm equipment. Last year, the US imposed three rounds of tariffs on more than $250bn worth of Chinese goods. China hit back by imposing tariffs ranging from 5% to 25% on $110bn of US products. A truce agreed last December collapsed and in May the US raised tariffs on $200bn of Chinese products to 25% from 10%. Again China retaliated with tariff on $60bn of US goods. The price of gold is also retreating after gaining 8% in June, with prices exceeding $1,400 per troy ounce. ""Gold has just had a strong run. Nothing goes up in a straight line,"" said Mr Mould. While it earns no income, like a share or a bond would, gold's indestructible nature and its place in history as a store of value make it attractive to some investors in times of strife. Other safe-haven assets also declined, including the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc. The dollar rose 0.4% against the yen to 108.26, and advanced 0.7% on the franc to 0.9830 francs.

"The girl's mother told BBC correspondent Fiona Lamdin her daughter was ""traumatised"" by what had happened A 10-year-old girl from Bristol was stopped from flying to Djibouti from London because of fears she was at risk of female genital mutilation (FGM). The girl was detained by police at an airport on Thursday and is now the subject of an FGM protection order. Her mother said the family was being ""treated like criminals"" and they had ""done nothing wrong"". Bristol City Council said: ""Where there is concern for the welfare of children and families we will act."" Nimko Ali said she would rather parents ""felt a little bit offended"" than a child ""be subjected to one of the most horrific forms of child abuse"" The girl's mother, who did not want to be identified, spoke to BBC correspondent Fiona Lamdin. She said: ""Why do I have to tell them where I am going? Why? We have no freedom of movement. We have done nothing wrong. I'm not going to send my daughter to an unsafe place. ""I have a sister who is five years younger than me and she hasn't had FGM and she is a mum now, she has daughters and even my nieces they haven't had any FGM so I wasn't even thinking of that."" Anti-FGM campaigner Nimko Ali said: ""When it comes to FGM I think the key indicator is that children - girls specifically - are being taken out of school just before the summer holidays because that is the specific time when FGM risk is heightened. ""I can understand that the family is upset that their holiday plans might have been interrupted but I think the police and the border agency had a legitimate reason in order to stop a child being taken out of the country during term time. ""Ultimately, I'm actually really grateful and thankful that the police and border agency have put the child's safety above that of community relations and walking on cultural eggshells."" A Bristol City Council spokesman said: ""Our commitment continues to be one where we put the safety of children and families first but to do so in an inclusive fashion supported by open dialogue. ""Agencies remain in communication with the family impacted by this case, and will continue to be so, to explain the action taken and the reasons why.""

"Well-known stockpicker Neil Woodford's flagship fund will remain locked for investors, it has been confirmed. The extension,announced as the initial 28-day suspension expired,external, means investors will have to wait at least another month to withdraw their money. Investors in the Equity Income Fund have now not been able to access their moneysince 3 June. Withdrawals were frozen after rising numbers of investors asked for their money back. ""It remains in the best interests of all investors in the fund to continue the suspension,"" Link, the regulated manager of the fund, said in a letter to investors posted on its website. The next update on the fund will be before 29 July, the next formal deadline for a review. Mr Woodford fuelled speculation that the fund could be locked for a long period, by reiterating that there is no ""prescribed limit"" to the suspension in avideo statement to investors.,external ""Of course, we understand that people want access to their money, they are very frustrated by not being able to deal in the fund. But we are using the timeâ.â.â.âto ensure we get the right outcomes for our investors,"" he added. Ryan Hughes, head of active portfolios at investment platform AJ Bell said it was now ""imperative"" that Mr Woodford communicated clearly with investors on progress. ""While this is difficult given liquidity is a moving target, investors deserve to be kept fully informed as the portfolio is repositioned."" Mr Hughes said the fund's performance had continued to deteriorate since the suspension, dropping 4% compared to a 3% rise in the FTSE All Share over the same period. Mr Woodford is one of the UK's biggest names in stockpicking - which is when a fund manager analyses the potential of different stocks to try to decide whether or not they will make a good investment. He was widely celebrated for previous success, and backed until the suspension by huge investment supermarket Hargreaves Lansdown - but both now face questions over how business was conducted amid criticism from investors. Neil Woodford faces regulator pressure over fees Hargreaves Lansdown boss apologises for Woodford suspension What went wrong for Woodford and why it matters Investor Claire Jebson and her husband have some of their money locked up in the Woodford fund. It was supposed to be used to help pay for son Sam's university education which is due to start in September. However, she does not expect her money to be unlocked for another six to 12 months - missing the planned start of his studies. ""We didn't know this block could happen - our mistake. It is good that we all are aware now, but sad that this had to happen for us to find out,"" she said, echoing the views of many investors. ""We do have a back-up plan and I am sure others are in a worse position."" Paul Madon, from Leicester, said he expected the value of the investment to drop sharply when the suspension is eventually lifted. ""I thought [the Woodford fund] would be boringly safe. It was not,"" the 67-year-old said. ""I will get out as soon as I can, and take the loss."" Stuart Evans based his investment on Hargreaves Lansdown recommendations Stuart Evans, who is saving for his grandchildren and spoke of his frustration with Hargreaves Lansdownlast month, also said he expected to take a ""big hit"" when the fund eventually reopens. When the fund launched five years ago, Mr Woodford's previous record meant thousands of investors trusted him with their money. At its peak, the Woodford Equity Income Fund managed Â£10.2bn worth of assets, such as local authority pension funds. In its first year, there were returns of 18% on investors' money, compared with an average rise of only 2% on the London Stock Exchange at the time. However, far from uniquely, this was followed by struggles in the last couple of years. Neil Woodford is under the regulator's microscope As a result, the fund has brought very little return for investors who have been in it throughout. Figures from FE Analytics show the fund has made a total return of 0.36% since its launch. It also meant that investors pulled out at an increasingly rapid rate. The fund now manages Â£3.7bn, according to the financial services and research firm Morningstar. Owing to this ""increased level of redemptions"", Mr Woodford and his backers said investors would not be allowed to ""redeem, purchase or transfer shares"" in the fund. In effect, it was suspended while they reordered the fund. There has been criticism that, in the meantime, Mr Woodford has continued to charge management fees to customers. Nicky Morgan, who chairs the Treasury Committee of MPs, said fees should be halted while trading in the fund was suspended.

"More than 20,000 people marched through Kilmarnock in protest at the closure ""It was horrible. You felt sick,"" recalls Ronnie Rankin, of the mass staff meetings at the Johnnie Walker plant in Kilmarnock on 1 July 2009. ""You couldn't wait to get out of there that morning."" The plan had been kept from all but the most senior managers at Diageo. Those making the announcement did not know if they would keep their jobs. Kevan Knox was a team leader on the bottling line. ""I'd been there 35 years at the time, and my wife for 36 years, and it really was a concern for us, because both of us were losing our jobs potentially. How would we manage with mortgages and cars?"" Alex Rae worked in spirits supply and blending. ""I thought I'd be there until I retired, because that's how sound it was. The day it was announced, it was out the blue - a bolt of lightning."" The Johnnie Walker brand is stronger than ever The announcement - 10 years ago today - came out the blue for the Scottish government as well. First Minister Alex Salmond was furious, and took part in a march of 20,000 people through Kilmarnock, pledging ""we're not going to walk away"". Nor was he going to let the plant's owner, Diageo, walk away. Yet it did.  More than 700 jobs went when the plant was finally wound down and closed in 2012.  Production moved to Shieldhall, at Braehead on the west side of Glasgow, and to Leven in Fife. Ten years on, Johnnie Walker is striding on stronger than ever.  A consultancy, Brand Planet, named it as the 25th most valuable brand in Britain in 2018, worth Â£3.6bn - the world's biggest whisky brand, the biggest commercial brand in Scotland, and more valuable than Rolls-Royce, Jaguar, Morrison's and Marks and Spencer. But in its home town, there is nothing left of that red brick plant.  On a 10-acre site overlooking Kilmarnock station and the town centre, a large modern building is now home to Ayrshire College. Workers at the old site believed their jobs were secure On the remaining 23 acres, there is only the pulverised remains of the brick and concrete. This summer, diggers move in to start on the Halo Regeneration Project. It has a budget of Â£65m. Its executive chairwoman, Marie Macklin, who grew up near the plant, talks of 1,500 jobs and Â£100m of added value to the Scottish economy. ""This will give our town the belief that they can change the world, the same way that Johnnie Walker did,"" she told me.  ""We're at the forefront now of the next industrial revolution"". The first building will be an innovation hub for start-up companies and some that have already made a start. Marie Macklin is an investor in such firms. To the west, there will be ""live-work"" units - an innovative idea that harks back to the days when artisans lived above the workshop. Ms Macklin says that start-up entrepreneurs go through an intense phase where they might as well be next to their workplace because it's such a demanding and engrossing role. There will be manufacturing units, with corprates already interested in occupying them. Towards the housing estate which brought wider notoriety to Kilmarnock through the BBC Scotland TV series The Scheme - now partly redeveloped - there is to be a ""wave-surf"" leisure centre. All that and more than 200 new homes. Scottish Power has signed up as one of the supporters, making the Halo site a pilot for a green industrial village, featuring electric-powered transport. Nothing remains of the old plant, but new plans are being drawn up to redevelop it Last month,Barclays made a big commitment to regeneration of the Ayrshire town, when its chief executive visited to announce it would be one of four UK towns to get a special focus to help boost their economic prospects.  Bury in Lancashire is the other one so far named, with a seaside town and a rural community to follow. Diageo remains involved. It handed one part of the site to Ayrshire College for Â£1, and it puts unemployed people through training there - aimed at jobs pulling pints and pouring drams in the hospitality sector. The Halo project got the remainder of the land for another pound. This was on Diageo's condition that it was not merely a commercial development, but one with strong outcomes for the town. The distilling giant has followed through with a Â£2m investment in Halo. It is pouring tens of millions into the Johnnie Walker visitor experience on Edinburgh's Princes Street and at four contrasting Scotch distilleries. That has irritated those in Kilmarnock, who reckon its heritage should have been part of that tourism trail. News of the closure was a crushing blow to the town But Diageo is in talks - with a more modest budget - to help those who want to mark the 200th anniversary, next year, of John Walker corking his first bottle. The company says that 707 people were employed at the Johnnie Walker plant in Kilmarnock when the closure announcement was made.  Of those, 194 continued to work with the company after the plant closed.  Some 431 took voluntary redundancy packages. This process was eased by offering voluntary redundancy terms to older workers at other plants, creating space for those from Kilmarnock.  Some moved home from Ayrshire to Fife, to work at Leven. A much larger number went to work at Shieldhall. But anecdotal evidence suggests that it didn't work as well as hoped. The early and late shifts fitted poorly with a commute of up to an hour, for which public transport wasn't much help. Former Johnnie Walker workmates Alex Rae, Kevan Knox and Ronnie Rankin Kevan Knox had to apply for a similar job to the one he was losing at the Hill Street plant, and spent three years being uncertain if that was going to be permanent. His wife Elaine commuted to the Glasgow plant for four months, before giving up. It didn't fit with family life. ""It was a period of uncertainty,"" recalls Kevan. ""Folk make you promises, but you need to know if you're actually getting a job. So we went through huge stress at that stage."" Ronnie Rankin was in logistics, and moved to Shieldhall, until Diageo handed the logistics operation to a contractor. He now works, along with Kevan Knox, in a similar role at the expanding whisky production operation being run by Loch Lomond Group in Catrine, East Ayrshire. Alex Rae recalls: ""After 35 years (working), I had to go to the job centre. I'd never been there before. And that's daunting in itself, just to get through the doors. ""I lasted a month, and didn't go back, just trying to go and get something.  It was degrading. You see some sights in there. Sometimes you get tarred with the same brush. ""Some (of the staff) are very nice. Some don't even look up. It's just 'sign that and away you go'. I'd meet people there and you'd blether and sometimes you'd hear there's a job going here or there, but we were all after the same jobs, and they were never full-time."" It has only been in the past year that Alex Rae has joined his friends in having a full-time and permanent job with Loch Lomond distillers. Says Kevan Knox: ""There are people we know who didn't get a job and, basically, their whole lifestyle changed. I know of certain folk who don't come out their house any more. They've not been able to find a job, and their whole life spiralled downwards. ""To be fair to the company, they tried to job-match people, but some couldn't go because of transport or commitments at home."" Other companies had to change radically when the supply chain to Kilmarnock fell away. In 2009, one unofficial media spokesman for the area was Marco Sinforiani, whose family has long run a newsagent close to the plant. With lower footfall, there was a sense of doom back then. But the shop remains open, having diversified into specialist drinks, notably gins, and specialist pasta. There is footfall from college students. Alex Milligan was chief reporter at the Kilmarnock Standard newspaper, having joined it in 1971. To him, the Johnnie Walker closure was the final blow in a series of closures on which he had reported. Listening to him, it's striking how diverse the Kilmarnock manufacturing base had been, but it now reads like a roll-call of closures: Saxone shoes, Massey Ferguson combine harvesters, Glenfield and Kennedy water valves and fittings. A railway carriage refurbishing yard remains busy, under the Wabtec firm. Diageo's departure was worse than the others, says the veteran journalist - by being so big, the last of the big manufacturing employers, and being so much part of the town's identity. ""It all started here in a grocer's shop and mushroomed into a major force all around the world. For the company to shut up shop and say 'we're off - cheers', betrayal is probably a word that sums it up."" Kevan Knox has less harsh feelings: ""I feel let down. I wanted to be with Diageo for life, and that's not happened. Personally, it's cost us. My wife and I didn't get the pensions we wanted. I wanted to see the 40 years out, and was three years out from that. But it gave us a good life."" Alex Rae concurs. ""You've got to let bygones be bygones. One door closes, and another opens"".

"This video can not be played How Hong Kong got trapped in a cycle of violence Hong Kong has seen several months of pro-democracy protests - and China appears to be tightening its grip. The protests began in June 2019 over plans - later put on ice, and finally withdrawn in September - that would have allowed extradition from Hong Kong to mainland China. They then spread to reflect wider demands for democratic reform, and an inquiry into alleged police brutality. Now, China is proposing to introduce a new national security law, which critics believe could be used to crack down on rights and political activists. This is not all happening in a vacuum. There's a lot of important context - some of it stretching back decades - that helps explain what is going on. It's important to remember that Hong Kong is significantly different from other Chinese cities. To understand this, you need to look at its history. This video can not be played The BBC's Helier Cheung on Hong Kong's 2019 protests It was a British colony for more than 150 years - part of it, Hong Kong island, was ceded to the UK after a war in 1842. Later, China also leased the rest of Hong Kong - the New Territories - to the British for 99 years. It became a busy trading port, and its economy took off in the 1950s as it became a manufacturing hub. The territory was also popular with migrants and dissidents fleeing instability, poverty or persecution in mainland China. Hong Kong's year in seven intense emotions Young, radical and ready for tear gas Read more about Hong Kong's history Then, in the early 1980s, as the deadline for the 99-year-lease approached, Britain and China began talks on the future of Hong Kong - with the communist government in China arguing that all of Hong Kong should be returned to Chinese rule. The two sides signed a treaty in 1984 that would see Hong Kong return to China in 1997, under the principle of ""one country, two systems"". This meant that while becoming part of one country with China, Hong Kong would enjoy ""a high degree of autonomy, except in foreign and defence affairs"" for 50 years. As a result, Hong Kong has its own legal system and borders, and rights including freedom of assembly, free speech and freedom of the press are protected. For example, it is one of the few places in Chinese territory where people can commemorate the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown, where the military opened fire on unarmed protesters in Beijing. Hong Kong still enjoys freedoms not seen in mainland China - but they are widely thought to be on the decline. Rights groups have accused China of meddling in Hong Kong, citing examples such as legal rulings that have disqualified pro-democracy legislators, and the disappearance of five Hong Kong booksellers, and a tycoon - who all eventually re-emerged in custody in China. There are also accusations that press and academic freedoms have been deteriorating. In March, China effectively expelled several US journalists - but also prohibited them from working in Hong Kong. The public broadcaster RTHK has come under pressure from Hong Kong's government, first for broadcasting an interview with the World Health Organization about Taiwan, and then for targeting police in its satirical news show ""Headliner"". The local examinations body also came under fire for a world history question about relations between Japan and China, with the government demanding the exam question be invalidated. The government said it was a professional, rather than political, decision, but many academics expressed concern. This video can not be played Police use tear gas on protesters Another sticking point has been democratic reform. Hong Kong's leader, the chief executive, is currently elected by a 1,200-member election committee - a mostly pro-Beijing body chosen by just 6% of eligible voters. Not all the 70 members of the territory's lawmaking body, the Legislative Council, are directly chosen by Hong Kong's voters. Most seats not directly elected are occupied by pro-Beijing lawmakers. Some elected members have even been disbarredafter Beijing issued a controversial legal ruling that effectively disqualified them. Hope and defiance on the streets of Hong Kong Were triads involved in Hong Kong attacks? Hong Kong'smini-constitution, the Basic Law,external, says that ultimately both the leader, and the Legislative Council, should be elected in a more democratic way - but there's been disagreement over what this should look like. The Chinese government said in 2014 it would allow voters to choose their leaders from a list approved by a pro-Beijing committee, but critics called this a ""sham democracy"" and it was voted down in Hong Kong's legislature. In 28 years' time in 2047, the Basic Law expires - and what happens to Hong Kong's autonomy after that is unclear. While most people in Hong Kong are ethnic Chinese, and although Hong Kong is part of China, a majority of people there don't identify as Chinese. Surveys from the University of Hong Kong show thatmost people identify themselves as ""Hong Kongers"",external-only 11% would call themselves ""Chinese"",external- and 71% of people saythey do not feel proud about being Chinese citizens,external. The difference is particularly pronounced amongst the young. ""The younger the respondents, the less likely they feel proud of becoming a national citizen of China, and also the more negative they are toward the Central Government's policies on Hong Kong,"" the university's public opinion programme says. Hong Kongers have described legal, social and cultural differences - and the fact Hong Kong was a separate colony for 150 years - as reasons why they don't identify with their compatriots in mainland China. There has also been a rise in anti-mainland Chinese sentiment in Hong Kong in recent years, with people complaining about rude tourists disregarding local norms or driving up the cost of living. Some young activists have even called for Hong Kong's independence from China, something that alarms the Beijing government. Demonstrations in 2014 went on for several weeks There's a rich history of dissent in Hong Kong, stretching back further even than the past few years. In 1966, demonstrations broke out after the Star Ferry Company decided to increase its fares. The protests escalated into riots, a full curfew was declared and hundreds of troops took to the streets. Do protests ever work in China? Young and unhappy in HK Protests have continued since 1997, but now the biggest ones tend to be of a political nature - and bring demonstrators into conflict with mainland China's position. This video can not be played The BBC's Nick Beake inside the Legislative Council after protests in 2019 While Hong Kongers have a degree of autonomy, they have little liberty in the polls, meaning protests are one of the few ways they can make their opinions heard. As a result, many see taking to the streets as their only way of forcing change. And, in the past, some protests have been successful. In 2003,up to 500,000 people took to the streets,externalto protest against a controversial security bill the Hong Kong government was trying to pass. The local government also backed down over""patriotic education"" classesfollowing rallies against the move. However, the Chinese government has adopted a harder stance in recent years, particularly with any movements it views as a direct challenge to its own authority. In 2014, demonstrators took to the streets peacefully for several weeks, demanding Hong Kongers be given the right to elect their own leader. But the so-called Umbrella movement eventually fizzled out with no concessions from Beijing. In June 2019, protesters took to the streets again, demonstrating against plans to allow extraditions to mainland China. This time, clashes between police and activists became increasingly violent. This video can not be played The history behind Hong Kong's identity crisis and protests - first broadcast November 2019 The bill was halted, and later fully withdrawn, but demonstrations continued for months, with demands for full democracy and an independent inquiry into police actions. In April this year, Hong Kong police arrested 15 of the city's most high-profile pro-democracy activists for taking part in unauthorised assemblies. In May, Hong Kong's police watchdog said it found no significant wrongdoing on the police's part during the 2019 protests - in a report that was criticised by many rights groups and external experts. The street protests have mostly died down during the coronavirus pandemic, although some small demonstrations, including singing protesters in shopping malls, have started again as restrictions are gradually eased. Now, China is proposing to introduce a new national security law in Hong Kong, which could be similar to the one withdrawn in 2003. It says the legislation is ""highly necessary"" and would ""safeguard national security in Hong Kong"". However, the new proposal is also controversial because it is expected to circumvent Hong Kong's own law-making processes - leading to accusations that Beijing is undermining Hong Kong's autonomy.

"Well-known stockpicker Neil Woodford's flagship fund will remain locked for investors, it has been confirmed. The extension,announced as the initial 28-day suspension expired,external, means investors will have to wait at least another month to withdraw their money. Investors in the Equity Income Fund have now not been able to access their moneysince 3 June. Withdrawals were frozen after rising numbers of investors asked for their money back. ""It remains in the best interests of all investors in the fund to continue the suspension,"" Link, the regulated manager of the fund, said in a letter to investors posted on its website. The next update on the fund will be before 29 July, the next formal deadline for a review. Mr Woodford fuelled speculation that the fund could be locked for a long period, by reiterating that there is no ""prescribed limit"" to the suspension in avideo statement to investors.,external ""Of course, we understand that people want access to their money, they are very frustrated by not being able to deal in the fund. But we are using the timeâ.â.â.âto ensure we get the right outcomes for our investors,"" he added. Ryan Hughes, head of active portfolios at investment platform AJ Bell said it was now ""imperative"" that Mr Woodford communicated clearly with investors on progress. ""While this is difficult given liquidity is a moving target, investors deserve to be kept fully informed as the portfolio is repositioned."" Mr Hughes said the fund's performance had continued to deteriorate since the suspension, dropping 4% compared to a 3% rise in the FTSE All Share over the same period. Mr Woodford is one of the UK's biggest names in stockpicking - which is when a fund manager analyses the potential of different stocks to try to decide whether or not they will make a good investment. He was widely celebrated for previous success, and backed until the suspension by huge investment supermarket Hargreaves Lansdown - but both now face questions over how business was conducted amid criticism from investors. Neil Woodford faces regulator pressure over fees Hargreaves Lansdown boss apologises for Woodford suspension What went wrong for Woodford and why it matters Investor Claire Jebson and her husband have some of their money locked up in the Woodford fund. It was supposed to be used to help pay for son Sam's university education which is due to start in September. However, she does not expect her money to be unlocked for another six to 12 months - missing the planned start of his studies. ""We didn't know this block could happen - our mistake. It is good that we all are aware now, but sad that this had to happen for us to find out,"" she said, echoing the views of many investors. ""We do have a back-up plan and I am sure others are in a worse position."" Paul Madon, from Leicester, said he expected the value of the investment to drop sharply when the suspension is eventually lifted. ""I thought [the Woodford fund] would be boringly safe.

Stuart Evans based his investment on Hargreaves Lansdown recommendations Stuart Evans, who is saving for his grandchildren and spoke of his frustration with Hargreaves Lansdownlast month, also said he expected to take a ""big hit"" when the fund eventually reopens. When the fund launched five years ago, Mr Woodford's previous record meant thousands of investors trusted him with their money. At its peak, the Woodford Equity Income Fund managed Â£10.2bn worth of assets, such as local authority pension funds.

"Boris Johnson has long criticised the Barnett formula Boris Johnson's leadership team have promised ""no change"" to how Scottish government funding is calculated if he becomes prime minister. Jeremy Hunt had already pledged to ""maintain"" what's known as the Barnett formula, and had challenged his rival to match his commitment. Mr Johnson has long criticised the formula. At one point he claimed it amounted to a multi-billion pound ""present"" from English taxpayers to Scotland. One Hunt supporter, John Lamont MP, welcomed what he said appeared to be a ""U-turn"" by Mr Johnson. Mr Hunt and Mr Johnson are competing against each other to become the next Conservative leader. Tory leadership: Compare the candidates Hunt pledges Â£6bn for farmers in no-deal Brexit Tory leadership rivals pledge to safeguard union The Barnett formula is used to share funds across the UK with allocations for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland linked to their populations and any changes in spending in areas such as health and education in England. It's controversial because levels of public spending per head are higher in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales than they are in England. Mr Johnson, a former London mayor, has been a persistent critic. In 2014, he said the then prime minister, David Cameron, had made a ""slightly reckless promise"" to retain it. Jeremy Hunt had challenged Mr Johnson to match his commitment He had previously described the system as being of ""amazing political antiquity"" and producing ""inequitable outcomes"". The SNP were among those expecting Boris Johnson to review funding arrangements for the devolved governments if he became prime minister. MSP Tom Arthur said: ""With the hard right-wing of the Tory party threatening to axe the Barnett formula and slaughter Scotland's public services it's time to take our future into our own hands."" But Boris Johnson's campaign has indicated that the system will stay the same if he replaces Theresa May in Number 10. A campaign source said: ""There'll be no change to the Barnett formula if Boris wins the leadership of the Conservative and Unionist Party and becomes prime minister. ""For the SNP to suggest otherwise shows a hitherto unseen level of desperation and underlines just how much they would fear a Conservative and Unionist Party led by Boris."" The Hunt campaign had also questioned Mr Johnson's commitment to existing funding arrangements. Conservative MP John Lamont MP, who is a prominent supporter of Mr Hunt, said: ""I'm pleased that despite what Mr Johnson has said in the past about reviewing the special funding arrangements for Scotland, he has now apparently u-turned on this policy. ""Jeremy Hunt has always been clear that he supports the continuation of the Barnett formula, no if, buts or U-turns.""

"This video can not be played Iran's FM Mohammad Javad Zarif says its next step will be enriching uranium beyond 3.67% Iran has breached the limit on its stockpile of low-enriched uranium set under a 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, a watchdog has confirmed. The International Atomic Energy Agency said its inspectors had verified the 300kg (660lb) cap had been exceeded. Iran stepped up production of enriched uranium, used to make reactor fuel but also potentially nuclear bombs, in May. It said it was responding to sanctions reinstated by the US after President Donald Trump abandoned the deal. The UK and Germany have called on Iran to reverse its decision, while the US said its strategy of ""maximum pressure"" would continue. President Donald Trump warned that the country was ""playing with fire"" after exceeding the limit. Iran's nuclear deal is on life support. Can it be saved? Why does the enriched uranium stockpile matter? Iran nuclear crisis in 300 words The nuclear fuel cycle,external European nations had warned that any violation would bring consequences, and the deal allows for the re-imposition of multilateral sanctions that were lifted in return for Iran limiting its nuclear activities. The development comes at a time of high tension in the Middle East, with Iran shooting down a US drone over the Strait of Hormuz in disputed circumstances, and the US accusing Iran of being behind two sets of attacks on oil tankers. Iranian state media cited Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif as confirming on Monday afternoon that the limit on its stockpile of uranium enriched to 3.67% concentration - the level required for civilian nuclear power - had been breached. ""Our next step will be enriching uranium beyond the 3.67% allowed under the deal,"" he said. ""The Europeans have failed to fulfil their promises of protecting Iran's interests under the deal."" Iran's Bushehr nuclear power plant can use low-enriched uranium as fuel He noted that the nuclear deal - officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action - saida party could ""cease performing its commitmentsâ¦ in whole or in part"",externalin the event of ""significant non-performance"" by any of the other parties. But Mr Zarif also stressed that Iran's measures were ""reversible"" if the Europeans began abiding by their commitments. The Iranian foreign ministry's spokesman said enrichment beyond 3.67% would start in 10 days unless European powers took ""practical and tangible steps"" to implement their new mechanism for facilitating trade and shield the Iranian economy from the effects of the US sanctions. The mechanism, known as Instex, essentially allows goods to be bartered between Iranian and foreign companies without direct financial transactions. It became operational on Saturday, but Mr Zarif said it did not meet Iran's needs. It has taken just a little over a year since the Trump administration abandoned the international nuclear deal with Iran for Tehran itself to challenge the agreement. Iran is saying enough is enough. It has stuck to its side of the bargain but the Americans have not only walked away from the deal, they have re-imposed sanctions and are trying to make it as difficult as possible for anyone to trade with Tehran. This policy of ""maximum pressure"" is acknowledged by the Trump administration. Its goal, its spokesmen insist, is to force Iran to the table to negotiate what in US terms would be a ""better"" deal. But Mr Trump's critics argue that what his administration wants is more capitulation rather than negotiation. Read more from Jonathan The UK - one of the five other countries still party to the deal along with France, Germany, China and Russia - said it was ""urgently considering next steps"". ""The deal makes the world a safer place by taking the prospect of a nuclear armed Iran firmly off the table,"" a spokesman for Prime Minister Theresa May said. Iranians have seen their country's economy slump since the sanctions were reinstated ""We have been consistently clear that our commitment to the JCPOA depends on Iran complying in full with the terms of the deal and we urge them to reverse this step,"" he added. UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said that ""such action by the Islamic Republic of Iran would not help preserve the plan, nor secure the tangible economic benefits for the Iranian people"". Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov called Iran's move a cause of regret, but said it ""should not be dramatised"". ""It should be seen as a natural consequence of all the events that preceded these circumstances,"" he was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency. ""Effectively, we are talking about a total oil embargo, an attempt to strangle a sovereign state."" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called on European parties to reinstate sanctions on Iran in line with the nuclear deal. Enriched uranium is produced by feeding uranium hexafluoride gas into centrifuges to separate out the most suitable isotope for nuclear fission, called U-235. Prior to enrichment, uranium ore concentrate must be converted into uranium hexafluoride Under the nuclear deal, Iran is only permitted to produce low-enriched uranium, which has a 3-4% concentration of U-235, and can be used to produce fuel for nuclear power plants. Weapons-grade uranium is 90% enriched or more. The deal also restricted Iran to stockpiling no more than 300kg of the low-enriched uranium. A stockpile of 1,050kg, however, could be further enriched later into enough material to build one bomb, according to the Arms Control Association. Iran strongly denies any intention to build nuclear weapons. In May, after the US ended exemptions from penalties for countries still importing Iranian oil â and those exchanging surplus Iranian low-enriched uranium for ore concentrate â Iranian President Hassan Rouhani announced that it would no longer comply with the 300kg enriched uranium cap. Iran nuclear deal - all you need to know How reinstated sanctions have hit Iranians Mr Rouhani also gave the five countries still party to the deal - the UK, France, Germany, China and Russia - until 7 July to meet their commitment to shield Iran from the sanctions' effects. Iran's President Hassan Rouhani says world powers have failed to abide by their commitments If they failed, he said, Iran might start enriching uranium beyond 3.67% concentration, and also halt the redesign of a heavy-water nuclear reactor at Arak. The nuclear deal is likely to collapse if Iran is found to be in ""material breach"" as a result of violating the stockpile limit or other restrictions on uranium enrichment. After 30 days, any of the other parties would be able to ""snap back"" the UN sanctions lifted under Security Council Resolution 2231, which endorsed the deal. Such a step cannot be vetoed. Iran's threat to enrich uranium beyond 3.67% is also a major concern from a proliferation standpoint. Iran insists its nuclear programme is peaceful, but experts say 20% enriched uranium is most of the way to weapons-grade uranium. That is because going from uranium's natural state of 0.7% concentration of U-235 to 20% takes approximately 90% of the total effort required to get to weapons-grade. The Arak reactor is also a proliferation risk because if it is not redesigned it will produce spent fuel containing plutonium, which could be used for a nuclear bomb.

"This video can not be played Hunt: We must be clear about the facts of no deal Jeremy Hunt has said he would decide by the end of September whether there is a ""realistic chance"" of reaching a new Brexit deal with the EU. The Tory leadership contender said he would deliver a provisional ""no-deal Brexit budget"" in early September and then give the EU three weeks. He vowed to abandon talks after that if there was no ""immediate prospect"" of progress and move to a no-deal footing. His rival Boris Johnson has vowed to leave ""come what may"" by 31 October. Speaking to reporters on Monday, Mr Johnson said it was important to have a ""hard deadline"" for leaving, adding that previous no-deal preparations had ""sagged back down"" after exit dates were not met. The Conservative Party's 160,000 members will begin voting next week and Theresa May's successor is expected to be announced on 23 July. Compare the leadership candidates Is there a Brexit 'war chest'? Hunt's tax plans 'could cost up to Â£65bn' Johnson tax plan 'would benefit wealthy' If successful, Mr Hunt said he would ""engage"" with fellow EU leaders during August, and task a new negotiating team with producing an ""alternative exit deal"" - including ideas to solve the Irish border issue - to be published by the end of the month. At the same time, he said preparations for no deal would continue in earnest, and all leave for civil servants at government departments would be cancelled unless he received guarantees that no-deal planning was ""on time and on track"". BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the timeline Mr Hunt was setting out was very tight - especially given the notice the government's fiscal watchdog, the OBR, usually needs to prepare for a Budget.

The foreign secretary also warned MPs against attempting to block a no-deal Brexit, warning it could make it harder to get a new agreement by giving the EU ""misplaced confidence that we'll give ground"". He added that detailed preparation plans for no deal were needed to make it a ""credible threat"" to the EU, and give the UK ""leverage"" in the talks. In a direct challenge to his leadership rival, he said the chances of a no-deal Brexit were ""far from"" the million to one odds recently quoted by Boris Johnson, and it would not be possible to deliver it ""on a wing and a prayer"". A no-deal exit on 31 October remains the default position in UK law after MPs rejected the agreement Theresa May agreed with Brussels three times. If that does happen, the UK will automatically begin trading with the EU under the basic World Trade Organization (WTO) rules. Under these rules, the tariffs - the taxes on imported and exported goods - will be different to what the UK currently trades under, which means the cost to farmers to export products could change or they could be affected by competition from abroad. TheNational Farmers Union has said,externalBritish farming will be ""damaged"" if that happens. This video can not be played Jeremy Hunt: Who is the Conservative leadership contender? In a speech in London, Mr Hunt said a government led by him would cover the costs of the tariffs that would be imposed on the exports of the farming and fishing industries. He promised to create a temporary ""no deal relief programme"" - designed to be similar toUS President Donald Trump's promise of Â£16bnfor farmers affected by Chinese tariffs. What is no deal? Can Parliament stop a no-deal Brexit? ""If you're a sheep farmer in Shropshire or a fisherman in Peterhead I have a simple message for you,"" Mr Hunt said. ""I will mitigate the impact of a no-deal Brexit on you and step in to help smooth those short-term difficulties. ""If we could do it for the bankers in the financial crisis, we can do it for our fisherman, farmers and small businesses now."" Farmers are worried about a no-deal Brexit, and this Â£6bn pledge comes on top of the undertaking by the government to pay farming subsidies at EU levels until 2022. Beef and lamb exports, for example, would face 40% tariffs in the case of no deal, and that would be after the EU had approved the UK as an exporter of animal products, which the National Farmers Union (NFU) says could take a minimum of six months. The UK exports about Â£14bn of agri-foods to the EU a year, so Jeremy Hunt's pledge would cover a lot of disruption but not the ""devastation"" that the NFU is warning of. Meanwhile, he would have to take care that this new regime did not fall foul of WTO rules on either state aid or export subsidies. Mr Johnson also promised to support the rural community after Brexit during a meeting with farmers in Cumbria last week, insisting farmers ""should be assured that we will support the rural community, with price support, efficiency payments, whatever"". Meanwhile, one of his leading backers, Health SecretaryMatt Hancock, told the Times,externalthe days of public sector ""pay freezes"" under Theresa May and David Cameron would be over if Mr Johnson was elected. Mr Hancock said: ""People in the public sector need to be properly rewarded for the brilliant job they do."" ""Now that there's money available, we need to show the public sector some love,"" he added. This video can not be played BBC political correspondent Chris Mason's guide to the political life of Boris Johnson But during a campaign visit in Kent on Monday, Mr Johnson declined to make a detailed pledge on public sector pay, saying only that remuneration should be ""decent"". He also defended his spending promises during the campaign so far, insisting he had a ""very carefully costed programme"". Analysis: Norman Smith, BBC assistant political editor It does all raise the question - where on earth is the cash for all these pledges going to come from? Have Mr Johnson and Mr Hunt discovered the proverbial ""magic money tree""? No, instead they're looking to dip into the chancellor's back pocket. Philip Hammond has suggested he has Â£26bn of what is called ""headroom"" in his current fiscal forecasts - basically, scope to borrow that much more - and Mr Johnson and Mr Hunt are saying they'd do just that. To many Tories this sits at odds with the thrust of Tory thinking. The other thing which makes the spending pledges slightly more dubious is that Mr Hammond says, ""Ok, I've got this headroom - but if we come out with no deal then all the money is going to have to be put into propping up the economy and getting us through that."" Both leadership contenders have unveiled plans to cut taxes and spend more, designed to win support for their candidacies, butquestions have been raised about how they would pay for the pledges. Earlier in the campaign, Mr Johnson said he wantedto raise the threshold for the higher rate of income tax,predicting this would stimulate the economy, and increase government revenues. He has said he would partially fund some of his plans from ""fiscal headroom"" carved out by current Chancellor Philip Hammond in his current spending plans. This amount - estimated at Â£26.6bn at the spring statement - is an additional amount the UK could borrow without breaking self-imposed limits on government borrowing. The figure is based on projections that assume the UK left the European Union with a deal, but Mr Hammondhas warnedthat handling a no-deal exit would absorb that potential cash. ""Either we leave with no deal or we preserve our future fiscal space - we cannot do both"", he said last month, and on Monday, he reiterated that message. Allow Twitter content?

Sources close to Mr Hunt have also suggested he would use this ""headroom"" to partially fund hispledge to boost defence spendingby Â£15bn over the next five years. But economist Paul Johnson, from think thank the Institute for Fiscal Studies,pointed out,externalthat the Â£26.6bn is ""a one-year target so can't fund permanent tax cuts/spending increases"". Speaking on Sunday, Mr Johnson said he would be prepared to borrow more to finance ""great objectives"" in his spending plan, whilst keeping ""fiscal responsibility"". He told Sky News there was up to Â£25bn ""available"" in the short term, due to the improved state of the public finances, which ""we intend to use"" on education, policing and broadband rather than reducing the deficit.

"This video can not be played Hammond: Candidates' promises 'exceed fiscal headroom' The chancellor has called on Tory leadership candidates to ""stop and think"" about their spending promises. Both Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson have announced a raft of policies during the contest, including cutting taxes and increasing spending on public services. But Philip Hammond said they needed to ""be honest"" as the policies ""greatly exceed"" the Treasury's coffers. He also said available money would be needed to support the UK economy in the case of a no-deal Brexit. Asked by BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg if the candidates were being honest with the electorate, he said: ""I think they need to be very careful about setting out these ambitions and being clear about the consequences of them."" The warning comes afterMr Hunt said he would decide by the end of Septemberwhether there was a ""realistic chance"" of reaching a new deal with the EU were he to become PM. The foreign secretary said he would deliver a provisional ""no-deal Brexit budget"" in early September, but abandon talks at the end of the month if there was no ""immediate prospect"" of progress - instead moving to a no-deal footing. His rival Boris Johnson has vowed to leave ""come what may"" by 31 October. Speaking to reporters on Monday, Mr Johnson said it was important to have a ""hard deadline"" for leaving, adding that previous no-deal preparations had ""sagged back down"" after exit dates were not met. The Conservative Party's 160,000 members will begin voting next week and Theresa May's successor is expected to be announced on 23 July. Is there a Brexit 'war chest'? Hunt sets 30 September 'no-deal deadline' Tory leadership: Compare the candidates Mr Hammond said the Treasury had ""built up fiscal headroom to protect against the cost of a no-deal Brexit"" and that money could be released ""if we have a smooth Brexit with a transition period in an orderly way"". But he said the current proposals on the table from Mr Hunt and Mr Johnson would already require increased borrowing beyond the government cap, or spending cuts or tax rises elsewhere - even without a no-deal Brexit-shaped ""hole"" in the public finances. Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson have been busy spraying around hypothetical cash - whether on defence, on care for the elderly, on schools, for more police, the list goes on. It is not politically surprising that they both want to signal they would turn on the spending taps a bit after a long, long period of cuts. But one of their erstwhile colleagues seems to have had enough. After making some carefully crafted warnings in the last couple of weeks, Chancellor Philip Hammond has tried to call a halt, telling the BBC that both of the candidates have to resist the temptation of a bidding war, worrying that the party's reputation is at risk too. Mr Hammond told me the candidates needed to ""stop and think"". And that by his calculation, both of the candidates' plans ""greatly exceeds"" the amount of wriggle room they will inherit from No 11 if they are lucky enough to be the one that moves in next door. Read more from Laura Mr Hammond also said the headroom wasn't ""a pot of money sitting in the Treasury"", but a way of borrowing more without breaching government limits. ""Whether it is a leadership competition or a general election, there is always a temptation to get into a bidding war about spending more and cutting taxes,"" he said. ""But you can't do both, and if we're not careful, all we end up doing is borrowing more, spending more on interest, instead of on our schools, hospitals and our police, and delivering a bigger burden of debt to our children and grandchildren."" He said the candidates' policies were ""sensible and interesting ideas"", but said the government had ""built up a reputation for fiscal responsibility... and it is very important we don't throw that away"". ""We have to live within our means and people have to be honest about the consequences of either spending more money or of cutting taxes that will have implications for borrowing or spending elsewhere,"" he added. Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington has also warned the candidates about their spending promises, saying they had to ""raise the money honestly from somewhere"". The de-facto deputy prime minister said: ""While in a short term crisis you can ease up on the borrowing, money borrowed has to be repaid by the next generation with interest - so you shouldn't take on extra borrowing lightly, nor should we be wanting to impose more taxes on people already working very hard. ""Sound money and restraint in public spending remains a good Tory principle."" He said the ""stewardship"" of Mr Hammond meant ""money is available"" to ""cushion the impact"" of a no-deal Brexit. But, he added: ""I don't think any of us should pretend that no-deal would be easy even with the most meticulous and thorough planning.""

"Mr Hamm said he sometimes had to kill the prey himself in cases where the animals were badly wounded A cat flap that automatically bars entry to a pet if it tries to enter with prey in its jaws has been built as a DIY project by an Amazon employee. Ben Hamm used machine-learning software to train a system to recognise when his cat Metric was approaching with a rodent or bird in its mouth. When it detected such an attack, he said, a computer attached to the flap's lock triggered a 15-minute shut-out. Mr Hamm unveiled hisinvention at an event in Seattle last month.,external The presentation was subsequently brought to light bytech news site The Verge.,external Mr Hamm used two of Amazon's own tools to achieve his goal: DeepLens - a video camera specifically designed to be used in machine-learning experiments Sagemaker - a service that allows customers to either buy third-party algorithms or to build their own, then train and tune them with their own data, and finally put them to use He explained that the most time-consuming part of the task had been the need to supply more than 23,000 photos. Each had to be hand-sorted to determine whether the cat was in view, whether it was coming or going and if it was carrying prey. Mr Hamm had to create a database of thousands of images to train the software The process took advantage of a technique called supervised learning, in which a computer is trained to recognise patterns in images or other supplied data via labels given to the examples. The idea is that once the system has enough examples to work off, it can apply the same labels itself to new cases. One of the limitations of the technique is that hundreds of thousands or even millions of examples are sometimes needed to make such systems trustworthy. Mr Hamm acknowledged that in this case the results were not 100% accurate. Over a five-week period, he recalled, Metric was unfairly locked out once. In addition, the cat was also able to gain entry once out of the seven times it had caught a victim. But when a software engineer suggested that it might have been easier to teach his cat to change its behaviour rather than train a computer model, Mr Hamm defended his work. ""Negative reinforcement doesn't work for cats, and I'd challenge you to come up with a way to use rewards to prevent a behaviour that an animal exhibits once every 10 days at 3am!""he tweeted in response.,external This is far from the only time that machine learning tech has been used to try to help cat owners. Another Amazon worker recently revealed he had used a similar set-up to try to prevent his cat from sitting on his living room table. Allow Twitter content?

Meanwhile, developers at Microsoft previously shared details of a smart cat flapthey had built that used facial recognition tech,externalto recognise the owner's pet, but block access to other animals. One expert told the BBC that the rapid roll-out of cloud-based artificial intelligence tools by the tech giants meant such experiments could now be carried out by increasing numbers of people. ""Amazon, Google and Microsoft have made it much easier to use AI by providing services like Sagemaker, that need little or no coding skill to use,"" said Martin Garner, from the CCS Insight consultancy. ""But truly 'democratising AI', so that anyone can use it, is as risky as democratising dentistry - what the world really needs is more properly trained AI engineers.""

"In a tiny room on the edge of a nondescript building complex sits an unlikely participant in Hong Kong's protest movement. Behind his laptop computer, Tony (not his real name) monitors scores of groups on private messaging app Telegram and online forums. Organisers say volunteers like Tony are running hundreds of Telegram groups that are powering Hong Kong's protest turned civil disobedience campaign. They claim thatmore than two million people have taken to the streetsin recent weeks to express opposition to a controversial extradition law. Hong Kong has experienced a series of mass rallies against the proposed law, which critics fear could spell an end to its judicial independence. Protestors expect a large turnout on 1 July, the anniversary of Hong Kong's return to China. Many of the calls to protest are made anonymously, on message boards and in group chats on encrypted messaging apps. Some groups have up to 70,000 active subscribers, representing about 1% of Hong Kong's entire population. Many provide updates and first-hand reports relating to the protests, while others act as a crowdsourced lookout for police, warning protestors of nearby activity. There are also smaller groups made up of lawyers, first aiders and medics. They provide legal advice and get supplies to protesters on the front lines. Demonstrators say the online co-ordination of protests offers a convenient and instant way to disseminate information. The chat groups also let participants vote - in real time - to decide the next moves. Votes are held in anonymous Telegram groups. In this one, 61% voted to ""return"" and 39% said ""police station"" ""They tend to only work when the choices are few or obvious. They do work when the situation lends itself to a black and white vote,"" Tony explains. On the evening of 21 June, close to 4,000 protesters voted in a Telegram group to determine whether the crowd would return home in the evening or continue to protest outside Hong Kong's police headquarters. Only 39% voted to take the protests to the police headquarters - but there was still a six-hour siege of the building. Other apps and services have also helped the protesters organise their activity. In public areas, posters and banners advertising forthcoming events are spread over Airdrop, which lets people share files with nearby iPhones and iPads. This week, a group of anonymous activists raised more than half a million dollars on a crowdfunding website. They plan to place advertisements in international newspapers calling for Hong Kong's extradition bill to be discussed at the G20 summit. The demonstrators say technology has made this a leaderless protest movement. ""The deeper cause is a result of the distrust towards the authorities,"" said Prof Edmund Cheng, from Hong Kong Baptist University. ""Many protest leaders in the Umbrella Movement have been prosecuted and imprisoned,"" he said, referring to pro-democracy protests in 2014. In April this year, nine leaders of those protests were found guilty of inciting others to cause a public nuisance. ""There are several potential charges you could be facing if you were to participate with an obvious organised movement or protest,"" says Tony. Many of Hong Kong's protesters go to great lengths to avoid leaving a digital footprint. ""We are just using cash, we don't even use ATMs during the protest,"" says Johnny, a 25-year old who has been attending demonstrations with his partner. He uses an old mobile phone and fresh Sim card each time he attends a protest. Another group administrator - who did not want to be named for fear of reprisals - said some people use multiple accounts to hide their online footprint. ""Some of us have three or four phones, an iPad, desktops and notebooks. One person can control five or six accounts. People won't know they are the same person and also multiple people use one account,"" they told the BBC. Tony believes that decision-making via group votes could protect individuals from charges. He argues chat group administrators have no affiliation to political parties and have no control over what members post in their groups. ""The government is not going to arrest every single participant in this movement. It is not feasible to do so,"" he says. But he recognises that law enforcement may pursue other avenues. ""They will pick influential targets or opinion leaders and make an example of them so that they could warn off the other participants."" On 12 June, one administrator of a Telegram group was arrested for allegedly conspiring with others to storm Hong Kong's law-making complex and barricade the surrounding roads. ""They want to let others know that even if you hide on the internet they may still come to arrest you in your home,"" said Bond Ng, a Hong Kong lawyer who represents several arrested protesters.

"Linthorpe Road is a main through route in the town In Middlesbrough, a bag of heroin can cost as little as Â£5. It is not the only town in England to see problems with the drug and homelessness. BBC Tees reporter Adam Clarkson spent an evening on the streets with people who wanted to tell their stories. ""You want hardcore? I'll show you hardcore."" Longshank is 46 years old. That's not his real name but how he wants to be referred to. He's homeless and has promised to ""show me the ropes"". About five years ago, he found himself sleeping rough. He had struggled with alcohol addiction for years, but said it was the death of his wife that saw his life spiral out of control. ""She was my partner in crime, the best thing that ever happened to me. I was with her 31 years. It broke my heart,"" he said. He's drinking a two-litre bottle of cider when we meet. He drinks at least one every day. ""I get wrecked just to get numb. I can't face the music,"" he adds, ""But life has to go on."" He describes his life as ""horrendous"". Discarded needles and syringes are easy to find Two days ago, somebody threw a bucket of urine at him. ""It was in the middle of Linthorpe Road. I was just sat there. They swilled me. You wouldn't believe it. I've never been so humiliated."" We walk to the same spot when a drunk man, who is known to Longshank, becomes aggressive towards me. Things become heated, but calm down as the man bursts into tears. He says he and his partner recently lost a baby, and are facing the prospect of becoming homeless. Evidence of drug use can be found in many back streets I am told that arguments and violence ""come with the territory"". Longshank then shows me ""the bedroom department"" - a sheltered car park behind a restaurant, where many rough sleepers congregate. This is where I meet a 22-year-old who introduces himself as Little Man. Little Man says he has been using heroin since the age of 12. ""It's upsetting. I didn't have to go down this route. It breaks my heart, I could do more with my life. There's guaranteed to be a drug dealer within 100ft,"" Little Man says. The bins where homeless people sometimes sleep I watch as Little Man, Longshank and a number of others pass around a bag of heroin. The powder is melted, mixed with vinegar and put into a syringe. One man injects himself in his groin. Tom Le Ruez, Middlesbrough Council's drug-related deaths co-ordinator, says mixing vinegar is ""not a particularly good idea"". ""It isn't advised that people inject at all, but injecting in environments like dark alleys increases the risk that people will damage their veins."" A bag of heroin costs as little as Â£5, I am told. Little Man says it's very easy to find. A member of staff comes out of the back door of the restaurant. She tells me Longshank is ""no bother"", but other people are known to start fires and defecate behind their bins. People on the streets try to find shelter where they can Three men arrive and ask if anybody wants to buy drugs. The atmosphere becomes tense when they realise I'm a journalist. Longshank says we need to leave, so we go back to Linthorpe Road. Longshank tells me he was given a flat by the local authority, but it was taken off him when he chose to sleep rough instead. ""I had appointments the next morning at the other side of town. I couldn't walk all that way to walk back again; there's no method in the madness."" I ask Longshank if he's using that as an excuse. He tells me it's possible he is. ""I'd miss all of these guys. It's not all doom and gloom, you know? We have a giggle. The streets are addictive, it is an addiction. It's worse than a drug."" In 2018, the North East saw the second biggest rise in rough sleepers, with a 29% increase. Despite this, the wider region has had the lowest number of rough sleepers in the country since the government began collecting data with an ""annual single-night snapshot"" in 2010. But Tracy Guy from Shelter said the true scale of homelessness in the North East is ""largely hidden from view"" as people are ""trapped in temporary accommodation or sofa-surfing with friends and family"". 'We know how brilliant Middlesbrough is' The team bringing refugees together The mystery around who Clucky is Radio 1's Big Weekend recreated in wool Little Mix, The 1975 and Miley Cyrus performed in the town for Radio 1's Big Weekend According to Middlesbrough Council, there are 11 rough sleepers in the town. That number has risen every year since 2016. The town has seen drug-related mental health hospital admissions rise from 16 per 100,000 people in 2013-14 to 43 in 2016-17. Debbie Cochrane, Middlesbrough Council's homeless lead, says help is offered to them every week. ""If they say no, that's fine,"" she says, ""but it doesn't mean we're going to stop trying because one week they might say 'I don't want to live like this any more' and that's when they would be welcomed with open arms. ""That's their life and we're not here to judge. It's not up to us to say 'that's wrong'. If that's how they want to live then that's fine, but the opportunity is there to break away - if that's what they want to do."" Longshank and I part ways. I go home, and he continues the cycle of begging, buying drugs and using them. ""Every day, it's the same"" he says. ""It's like space invaders. It's a game.""

"Mr Hamm said he sometimes had to kill the prey himself in cases where the animals were badly wounded A cat flap that automatically bars entry to a pet if it tries to enter with prey in its jaws has been built as a DIY project by an Amazon employee. Ben Hamm used machine-learning software to train a system to recognise when his cat Metric was approaching with a rodent or bird in its mouth. When it detected such an attack, he said, a computer attached to the flap's lock triggered a 15-minute shut-out. Mr Hamm unveiled hisinvention at an event in Seattle last month.,external The presentation was subsequently brought to light bytech news site The Verge.,external Mr Hamm used two of Amazon's own tools to achieve his goal: DeepLens - a video camera specifically designed to be used in machine-learning experiments Sagemaker - a service that allows customers to either buy third-party algorithms or to build their own, then train and tune them with their own data, and finally put them to use He explained that the most time-consuming part of the task had been the need to supply more than 23,000 photos. Each had to be hand-sorted to determine whether the cat was in view, whether it was coming or going and if it was carrying prey. Mr Hamm had to create a database of thousands of images to train the software The process took advantage of a technique called supervised learning, in which a computer is trained to recognise patterns in images or other supplied data via labels given to the examples. The idea is that once the system has enough examples to work off, it can apply the same labels itself to new cases. One of the limitations of the technique is that hundreds of thousands or even millions of examples are sometimes needed to make such systems trustworthy. Mr Hamm acknowledged that in this case the results were not 100% accurate. Over a five-week period, he recalled, Metric was unfairly locked out once. In addition, the cat was also able to gain entry once out of the seven times it had caught a victim. But when a software engineer suggested that it might have been easier to teach his cat to change its behaviour rather than train a computer model, Mr Hamm defended his work. ""Negative reinforcement doesn't work for cats, and I'd challenge you to come up with a way to use rewards to prevent a behaviour that an animal exhibits once every 10 days at 3am!""he tweeted in response.,external This is far from the only time that machine learning tech has been used to try to help cat owners. Another Amazon worker recently revealed he had used a similar set-up to try to prevent his cat from sitting on his living room table. Allow Twitter content?

One expert told the BBC that the rapid roll-out of cloud-based artificial intelligence tools by the tech giants meant such experiments could now be carried out by increasing numbers of people. ""Amazon, Google and Microsoft have made it much easier to use AI by providing services like Sagemaker, that need little or no coding skill to use,"" said Martin Garner, from the CCS Insight consultancy. ""But truly 'democratising AI', so that anyone can use it, is as risky as democratising dentistry - what the world really needs is more properly trained AI engineers.""

"Frances Hui speaks at a New York rally in support of Hong Kong protesters The protests in Hong Kong have heightened tensions between the territory and China, and generated headlines the world over. They have also deepened unease many thousands of miles away - on US campuses. ""I am from a city owned by a country that I don't belong to."" So began a column written by a 19-year-old Hong Kong student at a university in Boston. The piece, entitled ""I am from Hong Kong, not China"", in a student paper at Emerson College placed its author Frances Hui at the centre of a storm. Soon after publication in April, well before the protests in Hong Kong erupted, Hui's social media accounts were on fire. She received overwhelming support, including from Joshua Wong , Hong Kong's most prominent student activist who liked Hui's post. But the support was joined by a wave of criticism from mainland Chinese students at Emerson. One called Hui ""ignorant and arrogant"". Some commented that she and her parents should be ashamed. Another said Hui grew up enjoying electricity and fresh water supplied by the mainland, ""but now you claim you are Hongkonger, not Chinese?"" Protesters converge on Hong Kong's police headquarters on 21 June The most striking comment reads: ""Anyone who offends our China will be executed, no matter how far they are."" The sentence is originally from an ancient Chinese history book dated back more than 2,000 years. After being featured prominently in a popular Chinese nationalist action film in 2017, it's now frequently cited by Chinese netizens where they see China is under attack. ""I had a panic attack when I saw that comment,"" Hui told the BBC. She soon noticed some mainland Chinese students stared at her on campus, and some tagged her social media accounts, commenting that she looked ""small and weak"" in person. ""I felt I was being monitored,"" says Hui. She says many mainland Chinese take it personally when China is criticised, unlike Hong Kong people who often criticise their own government. Since the 1997 handover, Hong Kong people's growing distrust in the city's government and Beijing has been reflected in multiple large-scale protests, most recently in June when a massive march against a controversial extradition bill took place. China promised Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy within the ""one country, two systems"" framework, but many now worry the city's political freedom is tumbling due to Beijing's tightened grip. The background you need on the Hong Kong protests Young, radical and ready for tear gas A timeline of Hong Kong's history The political tensions have permeated interactions between mainlanders and Hong Kong people, even across the Pacific at American campuses. Frances Hui's column in the Emerson College student paper Three days after Hui's article was published, three mainland Chinese students at Emerson penned a letter of response in the student newspaper, the Berkley Beacon. It is globally and legally agreed that Hong Kong is a part of China, they wrote. The three co-authors turned down the BBC's interview request. Xinyan Fu, one of the three Chinese students, wrote in a public Facebook post that they respect Hui's political views and freedom of speech, but think her article is factually flawed. Fu called for her fellow classmates to refrain from personal attacks, but that did not seem to work. Under Fu's post, one commenter wrote: ""Shame on you."" Hui says she welcomes rational and respectful debate through the student paper. She insists her article did not argue Hong Kong is not part of China. Instead, it is about her ""Hongkonger"" identity. It's personal and should not be amended by others. Though Hong Kong is legally Chinese territory, Hong Kong citizens have diverse self-identities. According to a poll conducted by the Public Opinion Programme of The University of Hong Kong in December 2018, 15.1% of Hong Kong people identified as Chinese, in contrast to 40% as Hongkonger. 43.2% of them said they have mixed identity, Hongkonger in China, or Chinese in Hong Kong. A protester and Umbrella Movement supporter in Hong Kong on 21 June In the 18 to 29 age group, merely 4.1% Hong Kong people identified themselves as Chinese, while 59.2% of them said they are Hongkonger, Hui included. A mainland classmate agrees with her view, yet this person did not voice support publicly, fearing backlash from other mainland students, Hui says. The Chinese student who threatened to ""execute"" Hui was reported to the school, but Hui is unaware of any disciplinary actions taken by the college. In a statement provided to the BBC, Emerson College said it is deeply committed to fostering a respectful exchange of diverse viewpoints and perspectives. International students account for 16% among the college's student body, with most of them coming from mainland China and Taiwan. 'Shield Girl': The face of Hong Kong's protests In June, when an estimated one million Hong Kong people took to the streets, most American colleges were on summer break. The quarrel between Hui and her mainland Chinese classmates was put on hold. Hui moved her battlefield off campus. She co-organised and attended demonstrations in the US in support of the Hong Kong protesters. In a demonstration in New York, she wore a black T-shirt with ""I am a Hongkonger"" written in English and Chinese. ""Protect Hong Kong!"" She led the crowd to chant. This video can not be played Protests returned to Hong Kong streets following the suspension of the extradition bill For some Hong Kong students in the US, the anti-extradition protests became an opportunity for open discussions with mainlanders. Kenneth Tsui, a Hong Kong student at Maryland University, lives with a roommate from mainland China who after seeing the protests was asking Tsui questions about it. He and his Chinese classmates are used to debates in American classrooms, Tsui says, therefore even if they fail to convince each other, they usually agree to disagree. During the protests, Kaze Wong, a Hong Kong student at Johns Hopkins University, announced his support through emails and social media. He got a plethora of responses from mainlanders, most of whom wanted to learn about the protesters' perspectives, says Wong. One of Wong's mainland Chinese friends at Johns Hopkins, Andre Wang, offered to help spread the word. A protester at an anti-extradition rally in New York ""To me, Hong Kong represents hope. It shows me an alternative of ethnic Chinese society. Perhaps one day the mainland can be free like Hong Kong,"" says Wang, who retweeted protest photos on Sina Weibo, an equivalent of Twitter in China. The posts were soon deleted. Wang is supportive of the anti-extradition movement, but he says many Chinese students are indifferent because they were taught to go ""numb"" to politics and just accept what it is. The unpleasant exchanges experienced by Hui are hardly unexpected, Kaze Wong says. ""The young generations in Hong Kong and mainland China have very different self-identities."" Both Wong and Kenneth Tsui have friendly interactions with their mainland friends. They frequently share meals, plan grocery trips and work in the labs together. Yet both Wong and Tsui identify themselves as ""Hongkonger"". ""I always introduce myself as a Hongkonger,"" Wong says, ""If someone says I am from China, I'll go the extra mile to explain 'one country, two systems' to them."" Hui's column speaks the mind of many young Hong Kong people born in the 1990s or after, Wong says. Protesters hold up their mobile phones outside the police headquarters in Hong Kong on 21 June At the year of handover, they were very young or not yet born. After witnessing first-hand and participating in waves of social movements against Beijing, their Hongkonger identity has grown stronger and stronger, says Wong. In June, Wong and Tsui attended an anti-extradition demonstration in Washington DC, one of many gatherings taking place overseas in solidarity with the Hong Kong protesters. Afterwards, participants posed for photos in front of the White House. Wong noticed some, probably from mainland China, quietly walked out of the frame. Even thousands of miles away in the US, protesting against Beijing can be much too risky for the Chinese.

"This video can not be played Iran's FM Mohammad Javad Zarif says its next step will be enriching uranium beyond 3.67% Iran has breached the limit on its stockpile of low-enriched uranium set under a 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, a watchdog has confirmed. The International Atomic Energy Agency said its inspectors had verified the 300kg (660lb) cap had been exceeded. Iran stepped up production of enriched uranium, used to make reactor fuel but also potentially nuclear bombs, in May. It said it was responding to sanctions reinstated by the US after President Donald Trump abandoned the deal. The UK and Germany have called on Iran to reverse its decision, while the US said its strategy of ""maximum pressure"" would continue. President Donald Trump warned that the country was ""playing with fire"" after exceeding the limit. Iran's nuclear deal is on life support. Can it be saved? Why does the enriched uranium stockpile matter? Iran nuclear crisis in 300 words The nuclear fuel cycle,external European nations had warned that any violation would bring consequences, and the deal allows for the re-imposition of multilateral sanctions that were lifted in return for Iran limiting its nuclear activities. The development comes at a time of high tension in the Middle East, with Iran shooting down a US drone over the Strait of Hormuz in disputed circumstances, and the US accusing Iran of being behind two sets of attacks on oil tankers. Iranian state media cited Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif as confirming on Monday afternoon that the limit on its stockpile of uranium enriched to 3.67% concentration - the level required for civilian nuclear power - had been breached. ""Our next step will be enriching uranium beyond the 3.67% allowed under the deal,"" he said. ""The Europeans have failed to fulfil their promises of protecting Iran's interests under the deal."" Iran's Bushehr nuclear power plant can use low-enriched uranium as fuel He noted that the nuclear deal - officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action - saida party could ""cease performing its commitmentsâ¦ in whole or in part"",externalin the event of ""significant non-performance"" by any of the other parties. But Mr Zarif also stressed that Iran's measures were ""reversible"" if the Europeans began abiding by their commitments. The Iranian foreign ministry's spokesman said enrichment beyond 3.67% would start in 10 days unless European powers took ""practical and tangible steps"" to implement their new mechanism for facilitating trade and shield the Iranian economy from the effects of the US sanctions. The mechanism, known as Instex, essentially allows goods to be bartered between Iranian and foreign companies without direct financial transactions. It became operational on Saturday, but Mr Zarif said it did not meet Iran's needs. It has taken just a little over a year since the Trump administration abandoned the international nuclear deal with Iran for Tehran itself to challenge the agreement. Iran is saying enough is enough. It has stuck to its side of the bargain but the Americans have not only walked away from the deal, they have re-imposed sanctions and are trying to make it as difficult as possible for anyone to trade with Tehran. This policy of ""maximum pressure"" is acknowledged by the Trump administration. Its goal, its spokesmen insist, is to force Iran to the table to negotiate what in US terms would be a ""better"" deal. But Mr Trump's critics argue that what his administration wants is more capitulation rather than negotiation. Read more from Jonathan The UK - one of the five other countries still party to the deal along with France, Germany, China and Russia - said it was ""urgently considering next steps"". ""The deal makes the world a safer place by taking the prospect of a nuclear armed Iran firmly off the table,"" a spokesman for Prime Minister Theresa May said. Iranians have seen their country's economy slump since the sanctions were reinstated ""We have been consistently clear that our commitment to the JCPOA depends on Iran complying in full with the terms of the deal and we urge them to reverse this step,"" he added. UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said that ""such action by the Islamic Republic of Iran would not help preserve the plan, nor secure the tangible economic benefits for the Iranian people"". Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov called Iran's move a cause of regret, but said it ""should not be dramatised"". ""It should be seen as a natural consequence of all the events that preceded these circumstances,"" he was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency. ""Effectively, we are talking about a total oil embargo, an attempt to strangle a sovereign state."" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called on European parties to reinstate sanctions on Iran in line with the nuclear deal. Enriched uranium is produced by feeding uranium hexafluoride gas into centrifuges to separate out the most suitable isotope for nuclear fission, called U-235. Prior to enrichment, uranium ore concentrate must be converted into uranium hexafluoride Under the nuclear deal, Iran is only permitted to produce low-enriched uranium, which has a 3-4% concentration of U-235, and can be used to produce fuel for nuclear power plants. Weapons-grade uranium is 90% enriched or more. The deal also restricted Iran to stockpiling no more than 300kg of the low-enriched uranium. A stockpile of 1,050kg, however, could be further enriched later into enough material to build one bomb, according to the Arms Control Association. Iran strongly denies any intention to build nuclear weapons. In May, after the US ended exemptions from penalties for countries still importing Iranian oil â and those exchanging surplus Iranian low-enriched uranium for ore concentrate â Iranian President Hassan Rouhani announced that it would no longer comply with the 300kg enriched uranium cap. Iran nuclear deal - all you need to know How reinstated sanctions have hit Iranians Mr Rouhani also gave the five countries still party to the deal - the UK, France, Germany, China and Russia - until 7 July to meet their commitment to shield Iran from the sanctions' effects. Iran's President Hassan Rouhani says world powers have failed to abide by their commitments If they failed, he said, Iran might start enriching uranium beyond 3.67% concentration, and also halt the redesign of a heavy-water nuclear reactor at Arak. The nuclear deal is likely to collapse if Iran is found to be in ""material breach"" as a result of violating the stockpile limit or other restrictions on uranium enrichment. After 30 days, any of the other parties would be able to ""snap back"" the UN sanctions lifted under Security Council Resolution 2231, which endorsed the deal. Such a step cannot be vetoed. Iran's threat to enrich uranium beyond 3.67% is also a major concern from a proliferation standpoint. Iran insists its nuclear programme is peaceful, but experts say 20% enriched uranium is most of the way to weapons-grade uranium. That is because going from uranium's natural state of 0.7% concentration of U-235 to 20% takes approximately 90% of the total effort required to get to weapons-grade. The Arak reactor is also a proliferation risk because if it is not redesigned it will produce spent fuel containing plutonium, which could be used for a nuclear bomb.

"The leadership of the Church of England needs to better reflect the minorities who make up its congregations, the UK's first black female bishop has said. Caribbean-born Reverend Rose Hudson-Wilkin said her appointment should broadcast how diverse the Church was. She described being racially abused in the street recently, when a passer-by told her to ""go back to Africa"". Currently chaplain to the Queen and Commons speaker, she will become Bishop of Dover in November. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Rev Hudson-Wilkin said: ""It's been a long time coming and we're working at it and we are going to hold them [the Church] to account,"" she said. Church appoints first black female bishop ""The reality is minority ethnic membership makes up a significant part of the Church and this must be reflected in its leadership, not just with one person here and another person there. ""It must begin to filter through so that young people in minority ethnic background growing up within the life of the Church, within the life of this country, can see images of themselves reflected throughout."" She added: ""Visibility is important because if people can see it, then though know they belong."" Rev Hudson-Wilkin has openly criticised the Church's lack of diversity and has accused it of ""institutional racism"" in the past. Allow Twitter content?

"Mr Hamm said he sometimes had to kill the prey himself in cases where the animals were badly wounded A cat flap that automatically bars entry to a pet if it tries to enter with prey in its jaws has been built as a DIY project by an Amazon employee. Ben Hamm used machine-learning software to train a system to recognise when his cat Metric was approaching with a rodent or bird in its mouth. When it detected such an attack, he said, a computer attached to the flap's lock triggered a 15-minute shut-out. Mr Hamm unveiled hisinvention at an event in Seattle last month.,external The presentation was subsequently brought to light bytech news site The Verge.,external Mr Hamm used two of Amazon's own tools to achieve his goal: DeepLens - a video camera specifically designed to be used in machine-learning experiments Sagemaker - a service that allows customers to either buy third-party algorithms or to build their own, then train and tune them with their own data, and finally put them to use He explained that the most time-consuming part of the task had been the need to supply more than 23,000 photos. Each had to be hand-sorted to determine whether the cat was in view, whether it was coming or going and if it was carrying prey. Mr Hamm had to create a database of thousands of images to train the software The process took advantage of a technique called supervised learning, in which a computer is trained to recognise patterns in images or other supplied data via labels given to the examples. The idea is that once the system has enough examples to work off, it can apply the same labels itself to new cases. One of the limitations of the technique is that hundreds of thousands or even millions of examples are sometimes needed to make such systems trustworthy. Mr Hamm acknowledged that in this case the results were not 100% accurate. Over a five-week period, he recalled, Metric was unfairly locked out once. In addition, the cat was also able to gain entry once out of the seven times it had caught a victim. But when a software engineer suggested that it might have been easier to teach his cat to change its behaviour rather than train a computer model, Mr Hamm defended his work. ""Negative reinforcement doesn't work for cats, and I'd challenge you to come up with a way to use rewards to prevent a behaviour that an animal exhibits once every 10 days at 3am!""he tweeted in response.,external This is far from the only time that machine learning tech has been used to try to help cat owners. Another Amazon worker recently revealed he had used a similar set-up to try to prevent his cat from sitting on his living room table. Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played Iran's FM Mohammad Javad Zarif says its next step will be enriching uranium beyond 3.67% Iran has breached the limit on its stockpile of low-enriched uranium set under a 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, a watchdog has confirmed. The International Atomic Energy Agency said its inspectors had verified the 300kg (660lb) cap had been exceeded. Iran stepped up production of enriched uranium, used to make reactor fuel but also potentially nuclear bombs, in May. It said it was responding to sanctions reinstated by the US after President Donald Trump abandoned the deal. The UK and Germany have called on Iran to reverse its decision, while the US said its strategy of ""maximum pressure"" would continue. President Donald Trump warned that the country was ""playing with fire"" after exceeding the limit. Iran's nuclear deal is on life support. Can it be saved? Why does the enriched uranium stockpile matter? Iran nuclear crisis in 300 words The nuclear fuel cycle,external European nations had warned that any violation would bring consequences, and the deal allows for the re-imposition of multilateral sanctions that were lifted in return for Iran limiting its nuclear activities. The development comes at a time of high tension in the Middle East, with Iran shooting down a US drone over the Strait of Hormuz in disputed circumstances, and the US accusing Iran of being behind two sets of attacks on oil tankers. Iranian state media cited Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif as confirming on Monday afternoon that the limit on its stockpile of uranium enriched to 3.67% concentration - the level required for civilian nuclear power - had been breached. ""Our next step will be enriching uranium beyond the 3.67% allowed under the deal,"" he said. ""The Europeans have failed to fulfil their promises of protecting Iran's interests under the deal."" Iran's Bushehr nuclear power plant can use low-enriched uranium as fuel He noted that the nuclear deal - officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action - saida party could ""cease performing its commitmentsâ¦ in whole or in part"",externalin the event of ""significant non-performance"" by any of the other parties. But Mr Zarif also stressed that Iran's measures were ""reversible"" if the Europeans began abiding by their commitments. The Iranian foreign ministry's spokesman said enrichment beyond 3.67% would start in 10 days unless European powers took ""practical and tangible steps"" to implement their new mechanism for facilitating trade and shield the Iranian economy from the effects of the US sanctions. The mechanism, known as Instex, essentially allows goods to be bartered between Iranian and foreign companies without direct financial transactions. It became operational on Saturday, but Mr Zarif said it did not meet Iran's needs. It has taken just a little over a year since the Trump administration abandoned the international nuclear deal with Iran for Tehran itself to challenge the agreement. Iran is saying enough is enough. It has stuck to its side of the bargain but the Americans have not only walked away from the deal, they have re-imposed sanctions and are trying to make it as difficult as possible for anyone to trade with Tehran. This policy of ""maximum pressure"" is acknowledged by the Trump administration. Its goal, its spokesmen insist, is to force Iran to the table to negotiate what in US terms would be a ""better"" deal. But Mr Trump's critics argue that what his administration wants is more capitulation rather than negotiation. Read more from Jonathan The UK - one of the five other countries still party to the deal along with France, Germany, China and Russia - said it was ""urgently considering next steps"". ""The deal makes the world a safer place by taking the prospect of a nuclear armed Iran firmly off the table,"" a spokesman for Prime Minister Theresa May said. Iranians have seen their country's economy slump since the sanctions were reinstated ""We have been consistently clear that our commitment to the JCPOA depends on Iran complying in full with the terms of the deal and we urge them to reverse this step,"" he added. UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said that ""such action by the Islamic Republic of Iran would not help preserve the plan, nor secure the tangible economic benefits for the Iranian people"". Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov called Iran's move a cause of regret, but said it ""should not be dramatised"".

"This video can not be played Hunt: We must be clear about the facts of no deal Jeremy Hunt has said he would decide by the end of September whether there is a ""realistic chance"" of reaching a new Brexit deal with the EU. The Tory leadership contender said he would deliver a provisional ""no-deal Brexit budget"" in early September and then give the EU three weeks. He vowed to abandon talks after that if there was no ""immediate prospect"" of progress and move to a no-deal footing. His rival Boris Johnson has vowed to leave ""come what may"" by 31 October. Speaking to reporters on Monday, Mr Johnson said it was important to have a ""hard deadline"" for leaving, adding that previous no-deal preparations had ""sagged back down"" after exit dates were not met. The Conservative Party's 160,000 members will begin voting next week and Theresa May's successor is expected to be announced on 23 July. Compare the leadership candidates Is there a Brexit 'war chest'? Hunt's tax plans 'could cost up to Â£65bn' Johnson tax plan 'would benefit wealthy' If successful, Mr Hunt said he would ""engage"" with fellow EU leaders during August, and task a new negotiating team with producing an ""alternative exit deal"" - including ideas to solve the Irish border issue - to be published by the end of the month. At the same time, he said preparations for no deal would continue in earnest, and all leave for civil servants at government departments would be cancelled unless he received guarantees that no-deal planning was ""on time and on track"". BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the timeline Mr Hunt was setting out was very tight - especially given the notice the government's fiscal watchdog, the OBR, usually needs to prepare for a Budget.

The foreign secretary also warned MPs against attempting to block a no-deal Brexit, warning it could make it harder to get a new agreement by giving the EU ""misplaced confidence that we'll give ground"". He added that detailed preparation plans for no deal were needed to make it a ""credible threat"" to the EU, and give the UK ""leverage"" in the talks. In a direct challenge to his leadership rival, he said the chances of a no-deal Brexit were ""far from"" the million to one odds recently quoted by Boris Johnson, and it would not be possible to deliver it ""on a wing and a prayer"". A no-deal exit on 31 October remains the default position in UK law after MPs rejected the agreement Theresa May agreed with Brussels three times. If that does happen, the UK will automatically begin trading with the EU under the basic World Trade Organization (WTO) rules. Under these rules, the tariffs - the taxes on imported and exported goods - will be different to what the UK currently trades under, which means the cost to farmers to export products could change or they could be affected by competition from abroad. TheNational Farmers Union has said,externalBritish farming will be ""damaged"" if that happens. This video can not be played Jeremy Hunt: Who is the Conservative leadership contender? In a speech in London, Mr Hunt said a government led by him would cover the costs of the tariffs that would be imposed on the exports of the farming and fishing industries. He promised to create a temporary ""no deal relief programme"" - designed to be similar toUS President Donald Trump's promise of Â£16bnfor farmers affected by Chinese tariffs. What is no deal? Can Parliament stop a no-deal Brexit? ""If you're a sheep farmer in Shropshire or a fisherman in Peterhead I have a simple message for you,"" Mr Hunt said. ""I will mitigate the impact of a no-deal Brexit on you and step in to help smooth those short-term difficulties. ""If we could do it for the bankers in the financial crisis, we can do it for our fisherman, farmers and small businesses now."" Farmers are worried about a no-deal Brexit, and this Â£6bn pledge comes on top of the undertaking by the government to pay farming subsidies at EU levels until 2022. Beef and lamb exports, for example, would face 40% tariffs in the case of no deal, and that would be after the EU had approved the UK as an exporter of animal products, which the National Farmers Union (NFU) says could take a minimum of six months. The UK exports about Â£14bn of agri-foods to the EU a year, so Jeremy Hunt's pledge would cover a lot of disruption but not the ""devastation"" that the NFU is warning of. Meanwhile, he would have to take care that this new regime did not fall foul of WTO rules on either state aid or export subsidies. Mr Johnson also promised to support the rural community after Brexit during a meeting with farmers in Cumbria last week, insisting farmers ""should be assured that we will support the rural community, with price support, efficiency payments, whatever"". Meanwhile, one of his leading backers, Health SecretaryMatt Hancock, told the Times,externalthe days of public sector ""pay freezes"" under Theresa May and David Cameron would be over if Mr Johnson was elected. Mr Hancock said: ""People in the public sector need to be properly rewarded for the brilliant job they do."" ""Now that there's money available, we need to show the public sector some love,"" he added. This video can not be played BBC political correspondent Chris Mason's guide to the political life of Boris Johnson But during a campaign visit in Kent on Monday, Mr Johnson declined to make a detailed pledge on public sector pay, saying only that remuneration should be ""decent"". He also defended his spending promises during the campaign so far, insisting he had a ""very carefully costed programme"". Analysis: Norman Smith, BBC assistant political editor It does all raise the question - where on earth is the cash for all these pledges going to come from? Have Mr Johnson and Mr Hunt discovered the proverbial ""magic money tree""? No, instead they're looking to dip into the chancellor's back pocket. Philip Hammond has suggested he has Â£26bn of what is called ""headroom"" in his current fiscal forecasts - basically, scope to borrow that much more - and Mr Johnson and Mr Hunt are saying they'd do just that. To many Tories this sits at odds with the thrust of Tory thinking. The other thing which makes the spending pledges slightly more dubious is that Mr Hammond says, ""Ok, I've got this headroom - but if we come out with no deal then all the money is going to have to be put into propping up the economy and getting us through that."" Both leadership contenders have unveiled plans to cut taxes and spend more, designed to win support for their candidacies, butquestions have been raised about how they would pay for the pledges. Earlier in the campaign, Mr Johnson said he wantedto raise the threshold for the higher rate of income tax,predicting this would stimulate the economy, and increase government revenues. He has said he would partially fund some of his plans from ""fiscal headroom"" carved out by current Chancellor Philip Hammond in his current spending plans. This amount - estimated at Â£26.6bn at the spring statement - is an additional amount the UK could borrow without breaking self-imposed limits on government borrowing. The figure is based on projections that assume the UK left the European Union with a deal, but Mr Hammondhas warnedthat handling a no-deal exit would absorb that potential cash. ""Either we leave with no deal or we preserve our future fiscal space - we cannot do both"", he said last month, and on Monday, he reiterated that message. Allow Twitter content?

Sources close to Mr Hunt have also suggested he would use this ""headroom"" to partially fund hispledge to boost defence spendingby Â£15bn over the next five years. But economist Paul Johnson, from think thank the Institute for Fiscal Studies,pointed out,externalthat the Â£26.6bn is ""a one-year target so can't fund permanent tax cuts/spending increases"". Speaking on Sunday, Mr Johnson said he would be prepared to borrow more to finance ""great objectives"" in his spending plan, whilst keeping ""fiscal responsibility"". He told Sky News there was up to Â£25bn ""available"" in the short term, due to the improved state of the public finances, which ""we intend to use"" on education, policing and broadband rather than reducing the deficit.

"Rivals for the presidency, Margrethe Vestager (liberal, Danish); Frans Timmermans (centre-left, Dutch); Manfred Weber (centre-right, German) EU leaders meeting in Brussels remain divided over who should get the EU's top jobs, and talks have been suspended until Tuesday. They are arguing mainly over a successor to Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker. They had hoped to get a deal on Sunday night. Diplomats say summit chair Donald Tusk proposed Dutch centre-left politician Frans Timmermans to succeed Mr Juncker. Centre-right Bulgarian Kristalina Georgieva would replace Mr Tusk. Late on Sunday the summit was suspended so that Mr Tusk could hold bilateral talks, seeking a breakthrough. Talks then resumed over breakfast on Monday but were later suspended until 11:00 (09:00 GMT) Tuesday. The talks went on late into the night, testing the stamina of journalists Both German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron said choosing the candidates was now more complicated because the May European elections had ended the traditional centre-left and centre-right dominance of EU politics. ""When you have not just two partners, but three or four, the issue is not clearly defined,"" Mrs Merkel told reporters, admitting that the disagreement ""looks bad"". ""But a compromise must be found - historically it's immaterial if this takes a bit longer."" The May elections saw big gains for the liberals - including Mr Macron's alliance - and Greens, as well as for nationalists. But no group has a majority. What are the clear trends from EU elections? President Macron told reporters: ""we must learn from this setback - we're projecting an image of Europe which isn't serious, and we need better preparation for these meetings"". He lamented that ""what's lacking is a feeling and duty to defend Europe as a whole"". The rare Sunday summit was called because EU leaders failed on 20 June to agree on candidates for the Commission president's job and other top posts: European Council president (to replace Donald Tusk); High Representative for foreign policy (to replace Federica Mogherini); European Parliament president and European Central Bank president. This video can not be played Latvian PM Krisjanis Karins calls for national and gender balance Ms Georgieva was proposed to succeed Mr Tusk. She is an economist and ex-EU Commissioner, who has been chief executive of the World Bank since 2017. Mr Juncker's successor to run the Commission will be responsible for proposing new EU laws, enforcing the bloc's rules and handling trade deals. But Mr Timmermans, currently a deputy to Mr Juncker, faces stiff opposition from eastern European states and centre-right leaders from the EU's biggest political group, the European People's Party (EPP). In the proposed compromise, the EPP's candidate to head the Commission, Germany's Manfred Weber, would instead become European Parliament president. He might split the five-year term with liberal leader Guy Verhofstadt. The deal would put a liberal in charge of EU foreign policy, either Danish EU Commissioner Margrethe Vestager or Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel. All of the EU's top jobs are changing hands this year, after the May elections. The BBC's Adam Fleming in Brussels writes: The first priority for EU leaders (and reporters) is to get some sleep after more than 17 hours of debating, haggling, guessing, fighting and fruitlessly searching for compromise. The next is to agree a package of candidates for the top jobs before the European Parliament presses ahead and elects its president on Wednesday, which would reduce the national leaders' room for manoeuvre, by allocating one of the prizes. Of course the deadlock will be broken at some point - there will be a candidate for the job of Commission president eventually, and it probably won't even be a surprise. Old hands say this is nothing new. But plenty of people have started to ask whether this way of making decisions is sustainable, in a fragmented EU where no single person, party, institution or ideology has the power to make things happen. The choices have to take account of the elections and achieve an acceptable balance regarding large and small states, gender and geography. The European Parliament wants the leaders to stick to the ""Spitzenkandidat"" (lead candidate) procedure launched in 2014, under which those nominated by the most successful parties in the elections get the top posts. But President Macron is among those opposing the EPP's Manfred Weber and the ""Spitzenkandidat"" process. This video can not be played Who's in the running for Juncker's post and other EU top jobs? Politicians in Poland, Hungary and Romania meanwhile dislike the way Mr Timmermans, a veteran of Brussels politics, hasenforced the EU rule of law policy. Who is in the running for the EU's top job? Hungary's government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs tweeted,externalthat appointing Mr Timmermans to the top EU job was ""completely unacceptable"". The top EU appointments - especially for Commission chief - sharpen not only national rivalries but also those between the European Council and the European Parliament, which is the only directly elected EU institution. Mr Macron stressed the need to nominate two men and two women for the four key posts. The fifth - parliament president - is mainly in the hands of MEPs. The EU's Donald Tusk and Federica Mogherini will both have left by December The EU treaties say the government leaders - the European Council - have to nominate a Commission president, then MEPs vote on that candidate. The choice is made by qualified majority - that is: if 72% of member states vote in favour (21 out of the 28) and those states represent at least 65% of the total EU population The pressure is on: at their 15-18 July session, MEPs are to vote on the EU leaders' nominee, who is to take office on 1 November. The European Council president is to be elected by the EU leaders by qualified majority, and should take office on 1 December. He/she chairs EU summits and steers the bloc's broad strategy, while the Commission deals with the fine details. The High Representative for foreign policy runs the EU External Action Service (EEAS), dealing with major challenges such as Iran's nuclear programme, Kosovo and EU interventions in Africa. A favourite to become ECB president, taking over from Mario Draghi, is Jens Weidmann, head of the German Bundesbank. The ECB had to calm markets during the eurozone crisis and manage Greece's severe debt problems. The bank has enormous influence, given continuing concern about the euro. The European Parliament president steers MEPs' debates and their votes on most EU legislation. 'My job's hell': Who'll be next EC president?

"The leadership of the Church of England needs to better reflect the minorities who make up its congregations, the UK's first black female bishop has said. Caribbean-born Reverend Rose Hudson-Wilkin said her appointment should broadcast how diverse the Church was. She described being racially abused in the street recently, when a passer-by told her to ""go back to Africa"". Currently chaplain to the Queen and Commons speaker, she will become Bishop of Dover in November. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Rev Hudson-Wilkin said: ""It's been a long time coming and we're working at it and we are going to hold them [the Church] to account,"" she said. Church appoints first black female bishop ""The reality is minority ethnic membership makes up a significant part of the Church and this must be reflected in its leadership, not just with one person here and another person there. ""It must begin to filter through so that young people in minority ethnic background growing up within the life of the Church, within the life of this country, can see images of themselves reflected throughout."" She added: ""Visibility is important because if people can see it, then though know they belong."" Rev Hudson-Wilkin has openly criticised the Church's lack of diversity and has accused it of ""institutional racism"" in the past. Allow Twitter content?

"The success of Scotland's capital city is obvious but does it spread to all the country? The city of Edinburgh is no place to judge the success or otherwise of 20 years of devolved government. Its transformation is obvious. The streets of Scotland's capital teem with energy. The city centre is a forest of cranes as a vast new mixed-use development replaces the unlovely old concrete of the St James Shopping Centre. This is a prosperous, open city of many languages and a booming economy. So I went instead to the corner of Scotland where I grew up, to get a sense of what the Scottish Parliament looks like from there. I spent my high school years at Stranraer Academy, which was then one of the biggest comprehensive schools in the country. Galloway was - and remains - a fine place to raise a family but it felt, 40 years ago, like a long way from anywhere and very distant indeed from any centre of power. Has the return of political power from Westminster to Edinburgh changed anything here? Allan returned to his old school to talk to Stranraer Academy pupils Not if you ask today's Stranraer Academy school kids. ""We feel like lower class citizens"" one of them told me. ""Edinburgh and Glasgow are the higher class in Scotland"". I asked whether they got the educational opportunities they wanted. ""They used to teach French, German and Spanish here"", one girl said. ""Now we can only study French and even then there are only two French teachers [for a school with nearly 1,000 pupils]"". I asked for a show of hands among the dozen or so senior-school kids I was sitting with. How many of you expect to have to leave this area when you turn 18? Every hand except two went up instantly. Places like Stranraer can still feel a long way from the seat of power Forty years after I left here, what you might call peripheral Scotland still feels a long way from the centre political power. The birth of the Scottish Parliament doesn't seem to have done much to narrow the perceived gap. James Mitchell, professor of politics at Edinburgh University, says: ""The same argument that was always applied for having a Scottish Parliament - that Scotland was distinct and different - equally applies at the local level. ""The local authorities and communities are diverse with different interests, different priorities. ""We stand out in comparative European terms as one of the most centralised places in Europe."" Scotland's first First Minister Donald Dewar and Presiding Officer Sir David Steel arriving for the opening the new Scottish Parliament on 1 July 1999 Scotland's inaugural First Minister Donald Dewar said 20 years ago - at the opening of the country's first parliament in nearly 300 years - that ""this is about more than our politics and our laws - this is about who we are, how we carry ourselves"". Dewar died only 15 months after giving what probably remains the best speech ever delivered in the new parliament. But had he lived, he would scarcely recognise today's political landscape. Scotland and Britain 'cannot be mistaken for each other' Looking for Brexitland His own party, Labour, is a shadow of its old self. It had won every election in Scotland for nearly half a century. Then, 10 years after it created the Scottish Parliament, Labour collapsed. This year, it came fifth - (yes, fifth)- in the European elections with less than 10% of the popular vote in Scotland. The party that fought tooth and nail to oppose the very existence of the parliament - the Conservatives - have paradoxically been revived by it. They - under the leadership of Ruth Davidson - are now the second largest party. But it's the SNP whose fortunes have been most radically transformed. Labour adopted devolution in the 1970s and 1980s partly in response to the electoral threat the SNP was beginning to pose. Famously, as the Labour Defence Secretary George Robertson put it, a Scottish Parliament was what would ""kill nationalism stone dead"". It is the SNP whose fortunes have been most radically transformed by 20 years of devolution Instead, the SNP, which won power in 2007 and has held it ever since. It also led Scotland to within five percentage points of independence in the referendum of 2014. Forty years ago, as a first year student at Edinburgh University, I voted for the first time. The occasion was the 1979 devolution referendum. Scotland returned a small majority in favour of a devolved assembly, but the number fell short of the high bar set by the Labour government in London, which required at least 40% of all registered voters to vote in favour. Scotland, then, could not muster sufficient enthusiasm to cross that threshold. The 18 years of Conservative government after 1979 changed Scottish public opinion profoundly. The more Mrs Thatcher and, later, John Major ruled out a referendum on devolution, the more popular support for it grew. By 1997 there was a rock solid pro-devolution consensus in Scottish society. Scotland voted for it by a majority of three to one. The new Scottish Parliament was seen as a way of bringing power home, says Allan Little Scots saw the new parliament not just as a way of bringing power home but also as a way of blocking policies that had majority support in Westminster but which were unpopular in Scotland. The Scottish Parliament, for example, blocked university tuition fees and it dropped prescription charges. The Scottish government declined to lift the threshold for entering the higher rate income tax bracket when Westminster did that for the rest of the UK. Are we at a similar crossroads now, another 1979? There is certainly a new danger for those who want to keep Scotland in the UK, a danger openly acknowledged by both Ruth Davidson and Gordon Brown, both passionately pro-Union Scots: Brexit. Scotland voted overwhelmingly to stay in the EU but will have to leave anyway. Brexit: Survival of UK in doubt, Gordon Brown warns Scotland did not vote for Mrs Thatcher but went through the profound changes she pursued nonetheless. The more Mrs Thatcher set her face against devolution the more the Scots demanded it. The Scottish Parliament grew, in part, out of that experience. Similarly, Brexit, rejected by Scotland, has the potential to forge a similar shift in public opinion in Scotland. And each time I hear a contender for the leadership of the Conservative Party declare that they will ""not allow"" another referendum on independence, I hear the distant echo of the 1980s, and sense a further strain on the bonds holding this old Union together.

"This video can not be played The investiture ceremony took place in Caernarfon Castle Prince Charles begins his annual summer visit to Wales on Monday, as he marks 50 years since his investiture. The prince was 20 when he was crowned in a ceremony at Caernarfon Castle. The lavish event was watched by a TV audience of millions around the world, but polarised opinion in Wales. Charles was just nine years old when a recorded message from Queen Elizabeth II announced to an excited crowd at the 1958 Empire Games in Cardiff that she intended making him Prince of Wales. Reporter Brian Hoey, who was working at the games for the BBC, recalled: ""At that moment, there was uproar. The crowd really went crazy."" Former Lord Lieutenant of South Glamorgan Sir Norman Lloyd Edwards, who went on to know the prince well, also recalled the excitement at Cardiff train station, where he was at the time of the announcement. ""It didn't have a roof, but if it had had a roof it would have come off,"" he said. ""There was enormous excitement on the platform and in the railway station."" Among the guests invited to the investiture 50 years ago was Sir Nicholas Soames, a lifelong friend of the prince. Charles was crowned Prince of Wales in front of huge crowds ""It was one of the greatest days of my life and of course, it was made the more extraordinary because of what was actually happening,"" he said. ""Here was the creation of the Prince of Wales in the most wonderful and moving ceremony in that magnificent castle."" Street parties were held across the country, but it also polarised opinion between those who supported the role and those who believed it was an imposition on the country. The investiture was conducted against a backdrop of protests and even bombings. One of the bombs, which exploded at council offices in Abergele in the early hours of the day of the investiture,killed the two men it has always been assumed planted it,external. Five decades on, there are no major commemorations planned in Caernarfon. Dafydd Iwan said the investiture ""came out of nowhere"" amidst political turmoil In the late 1950s, Welsh nationalism was yet to spark into life. Eleven years later, when Charles was crowned, it was a different story. For Welsh folk singer and former Plaid Cymru president Dafydd Iwan, it was easy to be cynical about the event, which took place in the castle built by Edward I - the English king who had killed the last Welsh Sovereign Prince of Wales in the 13th Century. ""The 60s was a period of great change and amidst all the political turmoil came the investiture from nowhere,"" said Mr Iwan. ""We felt we had to resist that in 1969. We couldn't forget the way the title Prince of Wales had been taken from us, as it were, and given to the heir to the throne."" Criticism of Severn Crossing renaming Prince Charles: 70 years in 70 pictures The Prince of Wales, the oligarch and the stately home Dafydd Iwan's protest song ""Carlo"" became an anthem for the protests and he said he remains opposed to the position of Prince of Wales. But Mr Iwan added: ""There's no point in painting him as an evil character. ""I think he has done some excellent work through the Prince's Trust. I mean, he's done the best of a bad job. He has contributed, yes."" Since then, the prince has worked on projects in areas of interest to him; urban regeneration, the environment, architecture, sustainable farming, music and the arts. He also set up the Prince's Trust and Prime Cymru, which provide skills support and training to young people and the over-50s in Wales and elsewhere. In all, he has set up or become involved with 42 different charities or organisations in Wales. The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall unveiled a plaque to mark the new name for the Second Severn Crossing As early as 1970, the prince was making speeches about plastic pollution, telling a conference in Cardiff: ""When you think that each person produces roughly 2lbs of rubbish per day using non-returnable bottles and plastic containers, it is not difficult to imagine the mountains of refuse that we shall have to deal with somehow."" He eventually bought a home in Wales - at Myddfai in Carmarthenshire, the first royal residence in the country for hundreds of years - in 2006. And even now, even though he is thelongest-serving Prince of Wales, there are some dissenting voices. When the Second Severn Crossing wasrenamed the Prince of Wales Bridge, more than 38,000 people signed a petition asking for it to be named after someone else. But those close to the prince say he takes his role as the royal representative of Wales very seriously. Sir Norman had regular meetings with Charles in Wales, and says privately he is very passionate about the role. ""What I learned was that he is a very caring man indeed, and cares for the country, cares for the people,"" said Sir Norman. Prince Charles to share birthday celebrations with Barry man Prince Charles won't speak out when he's king Prince Charles' 70th marked with Â£5 coin The prince is involved in the ongoing transformation of an oil refinery near Neath into anew village with 4,000 homesusing local craftsman and a regional supply network which, he says, is better for the environment. And he uses Welsh firms as suppliers, spreading the name of local producers across the world. Former Welsh Secretary, Peter Hain, said he received regular letters from the prince while in government and that he has urged the prince to continue to speak out on issues close to him, even when he becomes king. If Charles becomes king, Prince William would be in line to be the next Prince of Wales. Having lived on Anglesey where he worked as anRAF search and rescue pilot, and been a regular and visiblesupporter of Welsh sport, he already has connections to the country. But are we likely to see another grand ceremony like that at Caernarfon Castle in 1969? BBC Wales' St David's Day poll,externalearlier this year found the majority of respondents - 61% - were in favour of another investiture. But Welsh academic and former international footballer Prof Laura McAllister said she thought that would not be wise. ""We are in a different environment now where people are less deferential to authority, and particularly towards Royalty, where they feel there are inequalities and privilege being reflected at a time when a lot of people are struggling to make ends meet,"" she said. ""If there was a decision to hold an investiture for Prince William, I would be incredibly surprised if this didn't prove to be a very, very divisive and significant moment in the political history of Wales.""

"Frances Hui speaks at a New York rally in support of Hong Kong protesters The protests in Hong Kong have heightened tensions between the territory and China, and generated headlines the world over. They have also deepened unease many thousands of miles away - on US campuses. ""I am from a city owned by a country that I don't belong to."" So began a column written by a 19-year-old Hong Kong student at a university in Boston. The piece, entitled ""I am from Hong Kong, not China"", in a student paper at Emerson College placed its author Frances Hui at the centre of a storm. Soon after publication in April, well before the protests in Hong Kong erupted, Hui's social media accounts were on fire. She received overwhelming support, including from Joshua Wong , Hong Kong's most prominent student activist who liked Hui's post. But the support was joined by a wave of criticism from mainland Chinese students at Emerson. One called Hui ""ignorant and arrogant"". Some commented that she and her parents should be ashamed. Another said Hui grew up enjoying electricity and fresh water supplied by the mainland, ""but now you claim you are Hongkonger, not Chinese?"" Protesters converge on Hong Kong's police headquarters on 21 June The most striking comment reads: ""Anyone who offends our China will be executed, no matter how far they are."" The sentence is originally from an ancient Chinese history book dated back more than 2,000 years. After being featured prominently in a popular Chinese nationalist action film in 2017, it's now frequently cited by Chinese netizens where they see China is under attack. ""I had a panic attack when I saw that comment,"" Hui told the BBC. She soon noticed some mainland Chinese students stared at her on campus, and some tagged her social media accounts, commenting that she looked ""small and weak"" in person. ""I felt I was being monitored,"" says Hui. She says many mainland Chinese take it personally when China is criticised, unlike Hong Kong people who often criticise their own government. Since the 1997 handover, Hong Kong people's growing distrust in the city's government and Beijing has been reflected in multiple large-scale protests, most recently in June when a massive march against a controversial extradition bill took place. China promised Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy within the ""one country, two systems"" framework, but many now worry the city's political freedom is tumbling due to Beijing's tightened grip. The background you need on the Hong Kong protests Young, radical and ready for tear gas A timeline of Hong Kong's history The political tensions have permeated interactions between mainlanders and Hong Kong people, even across the Pacific at American campuses. Frances Hui's column in the Emerson College student paper Three days after Hui's article was published, three mainland Chinese students at Emerson penned a letter of response in the student newspaper, the Berkley Beacon. It is globally and legally agreed that Hong Kong is a part of China, they wrote. The three co-authors turned down the BBC's interview request. Xinyan Fu, one of the three Chinese students, wrote in a public Facebook post that they respect Hui's political views and freedom of speech, but think her article is factually flawed. Fu called for her fellow classmates to refrain from personal attacks, but that did not seem to work. Under Fu's post, one commenter wrote: ""Shame on you."" Hui says she welcomes rational and respectful debate through the student paper. She insists her article did not argue Hong Kong is not part of China. Instead, it is about her ""Hongkonger"" identity. It's personal and should not be amended by others. Though Hong Kong is legally Chinese territory, Hong Kong citizens have diverse self-identities. According to a poll conducted by the Public Opinion Programme of The University of Hong Kong in December 2018, 15.1% of Hong Kong people identified as Chinese, in contrast to 40% as Hongkonger. 43.2% of them said they have mixed identity, Hongkonger in China, or Chinese in Hong Kong. A protester and Umbrella Movement supporter in Hong Kong on 21 June In the 18 to 29 age group, merely 4.1% Hong Kong people identified themselves as Chinese, while 59.2% of them said they are Hongkonger, Hui included. A mainland classmate agrees with her view, yet this person did not voice support publicly, fearing backlash from other mainland students, Hui says. The Chinese student who threatened to ""execute"" Hui was reported to the school, but Hui is unaware of any disciplinary actions taken by the college. In a statement provided to the BBC, Emerson College said it is deeply committed to fostering a respectful exchange of diverse viewpoints and perspectives. International students account for 16% among the college's student body, with most of them coming from mainland China and Taiwan. 'Shield Girl': The face of Hong Kong's protests In June, when an estimated one million Hong Kong people took to the streets, most American colleges were on summer break. The quarrel between Hui and her mainland Chinese classmates was put on hold. Hui moved her battlefield off campus. She co-organised and attended demonstrations in the US in support of the Hong Kong protesters. In a demonstration in New York, she wore a black T-shirt with ""I am a Hongkonger"" written in English and Chinese. ""Protect Hong Kong!"" She led the crowd to chant. This video can not be played Protests returned to Hong Kong streets following the suspension of the extradition bill For some Hong Kong students in the US, the anti-extradition protests became an opportunity for open discussions with mainlanders. Kenneth Tsui, a Hong Kong student at Maryland University, lives with a roommate from mainland China who after seeing the protests was asking Tsui questions about it. He and his Chinese classmates are used to debates in American classrooms, Tsui says, therefore even if they fail to convince each other, they usually agree to disagree. During the protests, Kaze Wong, a Hong Kong student at Johns Hopkins University, announced his support through emails and social media. He got a plethora of responses from mainlanders, most of whom wanted to learn about the protesters' perspectives, says Wong. One of Wong's mainland Chinese friends at Johns Hopkins, Andre Wang, offered to help spread the word. A protester at an anti-extradition rally in New York ""To me, Hong Kong represents hope. It shows me an alternative of ethnic Chinese society. Perhaps one day the mainland can be free like Hong Kong,"" says Wang, who retweeted protest photos on Sina Weibo, an equivalent of Twitter in China. The posts were soon deleted. Wang is supportive of the anti-extradition movement, but he says many Chinese students are indifferent because they were taught to go ""numb"" to politics and just accept what it is. The unpleasant exchanges experienced by Hui are hardly unexpected, Kaze Wong says. ""The young generations in Hong Kong and mainland China have very different self-identities."" Both Wong and Kenneth Tsui have friendly interactions with their mainland friends. They frequently share meals, plan grocery trips and work in the labs together. Yet both Wong and Tsui identify themselves as ""Hongkonger"". ""I always introduce myself as a Hongkonger,"" Wong says, ""If someone says I am from China, I'll go the extra mile to explain 'one country, two systems' to them."" Hui's column speaks the mind of many young Hong Kong people born in the 1990s or after, Wong says. Protesters hold up their mobile phones outside the police headquarters in Hong Kong on 21 June At the year of handover, they were very young or not yet born. After witnessing first-hand and participating in waves of social movements against Beijing, their Hongkonger identity has grown stronger and stronger, says Wong. In June, Wong and Tsui attended an anti-extradition demonstration in Washington DC, one of many gatherings taking place overseas in solidarity with the Hong Kong protesters. Afterwards, participants posed for photos in front of the White House. Wong noticed some, probably from mainland China, quietly walked out of the frame. Even thousands of miles away in the US, protesting against Beijing can be much too risky for the Chinese.

"In a tiny room on the edge of a nondescript building complex sits an unlikely participant in Hong Kong's protest movement. Behind his laptop computer, Tony (not his real name) monitors scores of groups on private messaging app Telegram and online forums. Organisers say volunteers like Tony are running hundreds of Telegram groups that are powering Hong Kong's protest turned civil disobedience campaign. They claim thatmore than two million people have taken to the streetsin recent weeks to express opposition to a controversial extradition law. Hong Kong has experienced a series of mass rallies against the proposed law, which critics fear could spell an end to its judicial independence. Protestors expect a large turnout on 1 July, the anniversary of Hong Kong's return to China. Many of the calls to protest are made anonymously, on message boards and in group chats on encrypted messaging apps. Some groups have up to 70,000 active subscribers, representing about 1% of Hong Kong's entire population. Many provide updates and first-hand reports relating to the protests, while others act as a crowdsourced lookout for police, warning protestors of nearby activity. There are also smaller groups made up of lawyers, first aiders and medics. They provide legal advice and get supplies to protesters on the front lines. Demonstrators say the online co-ordination of protests offers a convenient and instant way to disseminate information. The chat groups also let participants vote - in real time - to decide the next moves. Votes are held in anonymous Telegram groups. In this one, 61% voted to ""return"" and 39% said ""police station"" ""They tend to only work when the choices are few or obvious. They do work when the situation lends itself to a black and white vote,"" Tony explains. On the evening of 21 June, close to 4,000 protesters voted in a Telegram group to determine whether the crowd would return home in the evening or continue to protest outside Hong Kong's police headquarters. Only 39% voted to take the protests to the police headquarters - but there was still a six-hour siege of the building. Other apps and services have also helped the protesters organise their activity. In public areas, posters and banners advertising forthcoming events are spread over Airdrop, which lets people share files with nearby iPhones and iPads. This week, a group of anonymous activists raised more than half a million dollars on a crowdfunding website. They plan to place advertisements in international newspapers calling for Hong Kong's extradition bill to be discussed at the G20 summit. The demonstrators say technology has made this a leaderless protest movement. ""The deeper cause is a result of the distrust towards the authorities,"" said Prof Edmund Cheng, from Hong Kong Baptist University. ""Many protest leaders in the Umbrella Movement have been prosecuted and imprisoned,"" he said, referring to pro-democracy protests in 2014. In April this year, nine leaders of those protests were found guilty of inciting others to cause a public nuisance. ""There are several potential charges you could be facing if you were to participate with an obvious organised movement or protest,"" says Tony. Many of Hong Kong's protesters go to great lengths to avoid leaving a digital footprint. ""We are just using cash, we don't even use ATMs during the protest,"" says Johnny, a 25-year old who has been attending demonstrations with his partner. He uses an old mobile phone and fresh Sim card each time he attends a protest. Another group administrator - who did not want to be named for fear of reprisals - said some people use multiple accounts to hide their online footprint. ""Some of us have three or four phones, an iPad, desktops and notebooks. One person can control five or six accounts. People won't know they are the same person and also multiple people use one account,"" they told the BBC. Tony believes that decision-making via group votes could protect individuals from charges. He argues chat group administrators have no affiliation to political parties and have no control over what members post in their groups. ""The government is not going to arrest every single participant in this movement. It is not feasible to do so,"" he says. But he recognises that law enforcement may pursue other avenues. ""They will pick influential targets or opinion leaders and make an example of them so that they could warn off the other participants."" On 12 June, one administrator of a Telegram group was arrested for allegedly conspiring with others to storm Hong Kong's law-making complex and barricade the surrounding roads. ""They want to let others know that even if you hide on the internet they may still come to arrest you in your home,"" said Bond Ng, a Hong Kong lawyer who represents several arrested protesters.

"Wednesday's protesters came prepared for tear gas In just one week Hong Kong has witnessed two of its largest ever protests, as well its most violent protest in decades. At the forefront of these demonstrations are young people, many barely out of their teens. Why did they get involved - and how did they manage to force the government's hand? ""We screamed at people to run."" ""My parents kicked me out after the protests."" ""It was the first time I got tear-gassed - tears were coming uncontrollably out of my eyes."" ""I'm afraid to give my real name."" These are not words anybody would have expected to come out of the mouths of Hong Kongers - and certainly not ones aged between 17 and 21. Until recently the stereotype of a ""typical"" Hong Kong teen would have been one more interested in studying or making money than political activism or creative thinking. But last week saw the streets around Hong Kong's legislature taken over by young people wearing masks, setting up barricades, and throwing gas canisters back at police. Many of them were even too young to have taken part in the last Hong Kong protest to hold the world's media rapt - the 2014 Umbrella protests, when tens of thousands of people slept in the streets for weeks, demanding democratic elections. The 2014 protests - which were also known as the Occupy Central protests - ended without any concessions from the government. This time round it has been different. The latest demonstrations, against a controversial bill that would allow people in Hong Kong to be extradited to mainland China has, strikingly, forced the government to apologise, and pause its plans - effectively shelving them say many analysts. So what is different this time round? And what role has this generation of young activists risking tear gas, rubber bullets, and even arrest (let alone their future employment prospects) played? All the context you need on the protests 'Shield girl': The face of the movement Scale of the march in photos Hong Kong's youth have experienced something of a political awakening in the last two decades -the proportion of registered voters aged 18-35 rose from 58% in 2000, to 70% in 2016,external. And it's not surprising, when you consider that Hong Kong's political future is an increasingly pressing issue. The territory currently enjoys special rights and freedoms due to a handover agreement between the British, who previously colonised Hong Kong, and the Chinese government. But in 2047, the agreement enshrining Hong Kong's special status expires - and nobody really knows what will happen then. For today's youth, 2047 feels strikingly close - and their protest is driven by this uncertainty, as well as a feeling that the Chinese government is closing in anyway. This video can not be played Protests returned to Hong Kong streets following the suspension of the extradition bill No longer certain the system will protect them, they are modifying their protest techniques and learning the art of sophisticated dissent. Every single protester I interviewed who had taken part in Wednesday's unauthorised protests asked me to protect their identities - fearing arrest. ""We kept face masks on at all times during the protest, and afterwards we tried to delete our records on our iPhones and Google Maps,"" says Dan, an 18-year-old student who helped protesters build a barricade with fences. Some have taken to buying paper train tickets, rather than using their prepaid travel cards - on the basis this could make it harder for the authorities to trace their whereabouts. Meanwhile, many have become cautious about what they say on public social media - and are only willing to communicate on secure apps with self-destruct functions, such as Telegram. Jackie has been sleeping at university - fearing police could arrest her at home ""During the Occupy protests, most of us didn't think about protecting ourselves, we used Facebook, Instagram and Whatsapp to spread messages. But this year, we see that freedom of speech is getting worse in Hong Kong,"" says Jackie, a 20-year-old student leader. Several people - including students and teachers from Hong Kong's most prestigious institutions - have been arrested, some of them from hospital where they were having injuries treated. A 22-year-old who was identified as the administrator of a Telegram group sharing information about the protests was also arrested on ""public nuisance"" charges. Jackie fears that, amid all this, student leaders involved in Wednesday's protests may be targeted because of their higher profile. ""I've been sleeping at my student union office because I'm afraid of being detained if I go home,"" she says. This is typical of a more broken relationship with law and order officials, and compared to earlier protests, these activists have diminished faith in police. On Thursday, rumours circulated that police intended to search student bedrooms at a dormitory at the University of Hong Kong , where two residents had been arrested the previous day.

Amid the panic, students quickly called local legislators and lawyers, who surrounded the building - although ultimately, no police entered the hall. Dan says police actions during the Occupy protests -where a number of police were jailed for beating up a protester- had also damaged his trust. ""Before that, I believed police were supposed to be law abiding and help citizensâ¦ now, I realise that some police may let their personal emotions get the better of them."" Dozens were injured in Wednesday's clashes, including 12 police officers These students and young workers seem more willing to defy public assembly laws, and risk arrest for a cause, than previous generations of protesters. They argue they have more to fight for, as they have come of age in a more precarious political environment. Tom, 20, helped manage supplies during Wednesday's protest, and says he's an activist because of ""the era I'm growing up in"". His generation grew up experiencing witnessing political rows, such asplans in 2012 to make children take Chinese ""patriotism"" classes, that critics said would ""brainwash"" students and gloss over the Chinese government's human rights abuses. This video can not be played How Hong Kong demonstrators organised protests ""I've seen government policies and moves to suppress the freedoms we have grown up with - and it makes me feel strongly that I don't want Hong Kong to lose its core rule of law and freedoms."" Other young people have complained about government policies, including the recent introduction ofa law punishing those who disrespect the Chinese national anthem, the disqualification of pro-democracy and pro-independence legislators, and the jailing of a pro-independence activist. Have Hong Kong's youth lost hope in the future? Beijing's struggle to win Hong Kong's young hearts Hong Kong's post-handover generation The Occupy protests have left a clear - if complicated - legacy for today's protesters. Many of Wednesday's protesters were too young to take part in 2014's protests - but see them as both an inspiration and a lesson learned. Ben, 20, says his parents did not let him join the Occupy protests. But now, as a university student, he takes a leading role organising protests and legal support for students at risk of arrest. University students Ben and Tom helped the protesters with supplies and legal advice He describes the 2014 protests as a ""failure"" - as the protesters were split over their goals, including what sort of ""universal suffrage"" would be acceptable. But this time, there is a crucial difference - because protesters are not demanding more democracy, but fighting to keep what rights Hong Kong currently has. There is a greater incentive to stay united, because protesters are ""fighting to make sure we don't lose our existing freedoms"", he says. The Occupy protests spurred more young people to get involved in student politics and gave them the confidence to claim the streets as their own. Jackie, who helped run a first-aid station last Wednesday, describes them as her ""political awakening"". ""Previously I was not that involved in politics - but the movement made me realise how important it is."" They also taught today's youth just how to prepare for standoffs with the police. On one university campus, students stockpiled dozens of bags and cardboard boxes of medical supplies, such as inhalers for people affected by tear gas, and saline water to wash away pepper spray. Students said many items had also been donated by members of the public. This meant that they were a much more effective crowd on the Wednesday when things turned violent. Students bought and stockpiled inhalers They also prepared large amounts of drinking water What do their parents think of all this? It varies. Ingrid, 21, joined Wednesday's protests after she finished work, helping to deliver first aid materials to the frontline. She says her parents, who supported the police, kicked her out of the house after she went home - although they let her return a few days later. Meanwhile, Jackie ""didn't dare"" tell her parents and grandparents about her role organising the protests, but when they saw her on the news they were supportive and asked her to stay safe. Of course, it would also be a mistake to treat these protests as purely a youth movement. Leader Carrie Lam also came under pressure from several quarters, including from businesses groups, her church, and her alma mater. St Francis Canossian College was among the hundreds of groups to issue a petition against the bill - a significant move in Hong Kong where the top schools are considered highly prestigious, and alumni networks are influential and a source of pride. One alumni who signed, 22-year-old Aubrey Tao, said Ms Lam often quoted the school motto, and she hoped to show her that ""as a Franciscan, you shouldn't rule in this way"". Aubrey Tao, who did not attend Wednesday's protest, says the bill rekindled her concern for politics But it was the unauthorised, youth-led demonstrators on Wednesday - and their ability to camp out in numbers, organise and force the police hand - which many see as a critical factor in forcing the government to stop and pause. The wider population could easily have condemned the students - as they have done withprevious protests that turned violent. But it seems this time, they felt the police went too far. During clashes, riot police responded with rubber bullets, beanbag shots and 150 canisters of tear gas - more than was used during the entire 79 days of the Umbrella protests. Police defended their approach, saying it was necessary to respond to the ""riot"", and that protesters had attacked officers with bricks and iron poles. Some protesters who spoke to the BBC also confirmed they saw water bottles, or sticks, being thrown at police by others. Nonetheless, the sight of young protesters being pepper sprayed and facing large amounts of tear gas still left many angry at the authorities - and at Ms Lam, who had defended the police. Organisers say 6,000 people took part in a ""mother's rally"" on Friday In one viral video,a middle aged woman was seen screaming at police officers,external, reminding them ""you are going to be dads in the future"". Following the clashes, church groups went to join the protesters on the streets, singing ""Hallelujah"" to the police for hours. And thousands of women gathered for a ""mother's rally"", holding placards with slogans such as ""don't shoot our kids"". As the public mood intensified, former government officials began to speak out, urging Ms Lam not to rush through the legislation at such a heated time. Even some pro-Beijing lawmakers and officials started calling for a delay, admitting they had underestimated the public reaction to the bill - a significant response in a legislature where only about half the seats are directly elected by the public, and pro-Beijing groups hold the balance of power. Protesters have called on Carrie Lam to resign It's not clear where Hong Kong goes next - Ms Lam announced on Saturday that the bill would be paused, but even more people took to the streets on Sunday, demanding it be withdrawn entirely. Some at Sunday's rally were protesting for the first time, saying they had come out to take a stand against police violence, and show their support for the young protesters. What is clear is that the events have changed perceptions of protests in Hong Kong. Journalists accused the police of being heavy handed to the press - and wore their riot gear at a briefing in protest Tom says the anti-extradition movement ""broke through the past 30 years of protest traditions"". ""We never would have thought before that singing hymns in front of police for hours, mothers gathering for a protest, or reporters wearing their riot gear in a silent protest, would have worked."" Ingrid, who says she was tear gassed for the first time in her life on Wednesday, described the experience as agonising. ""It stung, I couldn't see - and I was in a dress and boots. I didn't know that water reacts with the itchiness - so when I took a shower I actually felt like I was in hell, it was scalding. I never want to hear that popping sound [of a gas canister] again."" And yet, she said she would keep protesting. ""My concern for how this city I call home will turn out far outweighs my fears for my personal safety."" Names have been changed.

"Linthorpe Road is a main through route in the town In Middlesbrough, a bag of heroin can cost as little as Â£5. It is not the only town in England to see problems with the drug and homelessness. BBC Tees reporter Adam Clarkson spent an evening on the streets with people who wanted to tell their stories. ""You want hardcore? I'll show you hardcore."" Longshank is 46 years old. That's not his real name but how he wants to be referred to. He's homeless and has promised to ""show me the ropes"". About five years ago, he found himself sleeping rough. He had struggled with alcohol addiction for years, but said it was the death of his wife that saw his life spiral out of control. ""She was my partner in crime, the best thing that ever happened to me. I was with her 31 years. It broke my heart,"" he said. He's drinking a two-litre bottle of cider when we meet. He drinks at least one every day. ""I get wrecked just to get numb. I can't face the music,"" he adds, ""But life has to go on."" He describes his life as ""horrendous"". Discarded needles and syringes are easy to find Two days ago, somebody threw a bucket of urine at him. ""It was in the middle of Linthorpe Road. I was just sat there. They swilled me. You wouldn't believe it. I've never been so humiliated."" We walk to the same spot when a drunk man, who is known to Longshank, becomes aggressive towards me. Things become heated, but calm down as the man bursts into tears. He says he and his partner recently lost a baby, and are facing the prospect of becoming homeless. Evidence of drug use can be found in many back streets I am told that arguments and violence ""come with the territory"". Longshank then shows me ""the bedroom department"" - a sheltered car park behind a restaurant, where many rough sleepers congregate. This is where I meet a 22-year-old who introduces himself as Little Man. Little Man says he has been using heroin since the age of 12. ""It's upsetting. I didn't have to go down this route. It breaks my heart, I could do more with my life. There's guaranteed to be a drug dealer within 100ft,"" Little Man says. The bins where homeless people sometimes sleep I watch as Little Man, Longshank and a number of others pass around a bag of heroin. The powder is melted, mixed with vinegar and put into a syringe. One man injects himself in his groin. Tom Le Ruez, Middlesbrough Council's drug-related deaths co-ordinator, says mixing vinegar is ""not a particularly good idea"". ""It isn't advised that people inject at all, but injecting in environments like dark alleys increases the risk that people will damage their veins."" A bag of heroin costs as little as Â£5, I am told. Little Man says it's very easy to find. A member of staff comes out of the back door of the restaurant. She tells me Longshank is ""no bother"", but other people are known to start fires and defecate behind their bins. People on the streets try to find shelter where they can Three men arrive and ask if anybody wants to buy drugs. The atmosphere becomes tense when they realise I'm a journalist. Longshank says we need to leave, so we go back to Linthorpe Road. Longshank tells me he was given a flat by the local authority, but it was taken off him when he chose to sleep rough instead. ""I had appointments the next morning at the other side of town. I couldn't walk all that way to walk back again; there's no method in the madness."" I ask Longshank if he's using that as an excuse. He tells me it's possible he is. ""I'd miss all of these guys. It's not all doom and gloom, you know? We have a giggle. The streets are addictive, it is an addiction. It's worse than a drug."" In 2018, the North East saw the second biggest rise in rough sleepers, with a 29% increase. Despite this, the wider region has had the lowest number of rough sleepers in the country since the government began collecting data with an ""annual single-night snapshot"" in 2010. But Tracy Guy from Shelter said the true scale of homelessness in the North East is ""largely hidden from view"" as people are ""trapped in temporary accommodation or sofa-surfing with friends and family"". 'We know how brilliant Middlesbrough is' The team bringing refugees together The mystery around who Clucky is Radio 1's Big Weekend recreated in wool Little Mix, The 1975 and Miley Cyrus performed in the town for Radio 1's Big Weekend According to Middlesbrough Council, there are 11 rough sleepers in the town. That number has risen every year since 2016. The town has seen drug-related mental health hospital admissions rise from 16 per 100,000 people in 2013-14 to 43 in 2016-17. Debbie Cochrane, Middlesbrough Council's homeless lead, says help is offered to them every week. ""If they say no, that's fine,"" she says, ""but it doesn't mean we're going to stop trying because one week they might say 'I don't want to live like this any more' and that's when they would be welcomed with open arms. ""That's their life and we're not here to judge. It's not up to us to say 'that's wrong'. If that's how they want to live then that's fine, but the opportunity is there to break away - if that's what they want to do."" Longshank and I part ways. I go home, and he continues the cycle of begging, buying drugs and using them. ""Every day, it's the same"" he says. ""It's like space invaders. It's a game.""

"This video can not be played How the European Commission president is chosen Marathon talks among EU leaders in Brussels have so far failed to produce agreement on a candidate to replace European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker. The contest is still wide open. Mr Juncker, at the helm of EU business since 2014, is to pass on the baton at the end of October. ""I am glad to see that I am not easy to replace,"" he chuckled in response to the delayed decision. The European Council - the EU government leaders - were meeting again on Tuesday with hopes of a breakthrough. Meanwhile, newly-elected MEPs were also meeting in Strasbourg. The May European elections left the 28-nation bloc's parliament more fragmented, complicating decision-making. The role of Commission president, whose candidacy requires parliamentary approval, proposes new EU laws, enforces the bloc's rules and handles trade deals. So who might run it, based on what we know so far? What is the EU and how does it work? Who pays most in and who gets most back? For:A big name in Danish politics, Ms Vestager has spent the past five years as competition commissioner, spearheading EU anti-trust investigations that have ended in big fines for technology giants Google and Apple. Her battle to protect consumers and make large firms pay earned her the wrath of US President Donald Trump last year, who is reported to have told Mr Juncker following news of the hefty fines: ""Your tax lady, she really hates the US."" Ms Vestager is certainly causing a buzz and the liberal group, now called Renew Europe, gained ground in the elections, partly thanks to the arrival of President Macron's party. Against:She may struggle to win support from the biggest group in parliament, the centre-right European People's Party. And she risks being dropped if the European Council decides that the ""Spitzenkandidaten"" race of lead candidates cannot work. She is one of three Spitzenkandidaten put forward by the European Parliament - along with Manfred Weber of the centre right and Frans Timmermans of the centre left. German Chancellor Angela Merkel is quoted as saying that if EPP choice Manfred Weber is ditched, then Mr Timmermans and Ms Vestager are ruled out too. What she says:""I have worked with breaking monopolies. This is also what voters have been doing. The monopoly of power is broken,"" she declared after the elections that broke the majority of the two big centre-right and centre-left blocs in the European Parliament. Candidates spar on TV for top EU job What the European Parliament has done in the last five years For:Frans Timmermans has the wind in his sails, having led the Dutch centre-left Labour party to a dramatic, unexpected victory in the European elections, winning 19% of the vote on the back of a pro-European campaign. The First Vice-President of the European Commission emerged as front-runner during the marathon talks in Brussels. He helped steer through EU legislation banning plastic straws and negotiated the EU's 2016 deal with Turkey to reduce the flow of migrants. He was lampooned by political opponents as Eurocrat ""Hans Brusselmans""; but the negative message failed and the multi-lingual Labour leader took advantage of his election campaign to push for the Commission presidency. Against:He is disliked in Poland, Hungary and Romania for challenging their governments over rule of law, and Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis said his candidacy was ""unacceptable for us, it would be a total catastrophe"". Italy has also opposed him. What he says:Warning of the risks of nationalism he said last month: ""People who used to vote for my party and many parties here are now voting for nationalist parties, sometimes even extremist parties. That's our fault,"" he said. He also spoke of Brexit as leaving the UK looking like ""Game of Thrones on steroids"". His latest policy proposals for the bloc include a minimum EU-wide rate of corporation tax of 18%, and the implementation of a minimum wage in every member state. Dutch Labour party celebrate after European vote For:A high-flyer in the EPP, the 46-year-old Bavarian's candidacy has been endorsed by Chancellor Merkel and he has led the EPP since 2014. EU's big two divided over Brussels' top job Against:The EPP lost ground in the elections and Mr Weber, initially a favourite, seems all but out of the race as the liberals and socialists say they will not back him. Critics question his qualifications for the top EU job; he has never held a government post. At the summit, French President Emmanuel Macron said all three lead candidate names were ""tested"" and ""there was no majority"". Greece's socialist Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras declared that Mr Weber's candidacy had divided Europe and was ""off the table"". What he says:He has advocated strengthening security across the bloc and protecting the ""European way of life"". In a Twitter post in November, which featured a promotional video, he wrote:""Here and everywhere else people are asking us to bring Europe back home."",external He has promised to appoint a commissioner to oversee a new relationship with Africa to help control migration to Europe, and has said that future trade deals with other countries should include clauses banning child labour. For:After the Green surge in the May elections, her group is now the fourth biggest in the European Parliament and environmental issues are at the heart of the EU's agenda for the next five years. In her home country, Germany, the Greens now top the opinion polls. Ska Keller stood as Green ""Spitzenkandidat"" in 2014, and is as focused on the rights of migrants as on the environment. She became an MEP in 2009 at the age of 27 and has said that, while she aims to represent everybody, young people in particular need a louder voice in Europe. She has a masters in Islamic Studies, Turkology and Jewish Studies. Against:Up against the other candidates, Ms Keller is likely to struggle to find the support of enough member states. Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary - heavily reliant on coal - are resisting the green ambitions of many EU partners. What she says:Ska Keller wants to tackle climate change but not through banning air travel. ""If trains become cheaper and better, we'll make short-haul flights redundant."" Climate change: Where we are in seven charts For:He may not be a candidate, but few EU figures have had a profile as dominant as this 68-year-old former French foreign minister, who succeeded in keeping 27 countries on the same page during the bloc's Brexit negotiations with the UK. He is admired by President Macron, who said he was ""one of the European leaders that have eminent qualities and can be on the list [of candidates for EU top jobs]"". Against:Once said by former French President Nicolas Sarkozy to possess the ""charisma of an oyster"", Mr Barnier is known for choosing his words carefully and has a precise manner when addressing leaders - often with a formidable stare. He is also known for backing the legacy of post-war President Charles de Gaulle, who advocated a centralised economy, powerful presidency and independent foreign policy. What he says:""Now more than ever, we Europeans need collective action in defence of our values and a rules-based international order. This could be Europe's moment, based on a more robust and decisive European Union."" (January 2019 opinion piece,external) For:The Dutch prime minister is a head of government - a definite advantage in the contest for either the role of Commission chief or European Council president. He is also a liberal, and his group boosted their numbers in the European elections. The EU is also anxious about the economic impact of Brexit, and the Netherlands is one of the UK's closest partners, so Mr Rutte could score political points there, as a safe bet for avoiding a collision with the UK. He has warned that Brexit will ""diminish"" the UK's status internationally. Against:He is backing Margrethe Vestager who, as a liberal woman from one of the smaller EU nations, is seen as a strong candidate. He has expressed no interest in getting the Commission president job. There is already a prominent Dutch ""Spitzenkandidat"" and EU veteran in the race - Frans Timmermans. What he says:""I'm staying in the Netherlands. I already have a top post: prime minister of the Kingdom of the Netherlands and being a member of the European Council. And I love it."" For:The 63-year-old, a political independent, has served two consecutive terms as Lithuania's president. She served as EU budget commissioner in 2004-2009, so she has plenty of experience of EU business. Her presidential term ends in July - good timing for a move to Brussels. In terms of EU efforts to achieve gender and geographical balance, she has the advantage of being a woman from a small, eastern European state. She could be a compromise candidate, as she is not tied to any particular party. Against:She is nicknamed ""Steel Magnolia"" for her tough stance on corruption and relations with Russia. The EU is keeping sanctions against Russia in place, condemning its annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region. But many EU countries depend on Russian gas, and Ms Grybauskaite's stance is unlikely to ease tensions with the EU's huge neighbour. What she says:""My climb to political success was no elevator ride, and it has not always been pretty, but I persevered as one of a handful of women in the male-dominated world of politics.""

"The leadership of the Church of England needs to better reflect the minorities who make up its congregations, the UK's first black female bishop has said. Caribbean-born Reverend Rose Hudson-Wilkin said her appointment should broadcast how diverse the Church was. She described being racially abused in the street recently, when a passer-by told her to ""go back to Africa"". Currently chaplain to the Queen and Commons speaker, she will become Bishop of Dover in November. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Rev Hudson-Wilkin said: ""It's been a long time coming and we're working at it and we are going to hold them [the Church] to account,"" she said. Church appoints first black female bishop ""The reality is minority ethnic membership makes up a significant part of the Church and this must be reflected in its leadership, not just with one person here and another person there. ""It must begin to filter through so that young people in minority ethnic background growing up within the life of the Church, within the life of this country, can see images of themselves reflected throughout."" She added: ""Visibility is important because if people can see it, then though know they belong."" Rev Hudson-Wilkin has openly criticised the Church's lack of diversity and has accused it of ""institutional racism"" in the past. Allow Twitter content?

"Childcare in England risks becoming the preserve of the wealthy, unless a Â£660m funding gap in a free childcare scheme is plugged, MPs are warning. Severe financial strain has been placed on private and independent nurseries offering the government's flagship free 30-hours scheme, they report. And those operating in poor areas are more likely to be threatened with closure, they say. The government said low income families received help with childcare costs. The national scheme offers working parents of three and four-year-olds 30 hours of free childcare a week - up from 15 hours in 2017. But early years providers have long said the level at which these hours are funded by a government grant has meant operators have had to find other ways of making up the difference. The All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Childcare and Early Education heard evidence of a potential reduction in nursery places in deprived areas, while in affluent areas an increase in places looks likely. This was highlighted by Nicole Politis, director of the Portico Nursery Group, who told the parliamentary inquiry that she had a number of nurseries in different socio-economic areas. She said: ""Three years ago, nurseries in these deprived areas were completely full. ""Now, those in affluent areas are full, and in deprived areas the numbers of children attending are so low that I'm having to close them. ""Sadly, some parents cannot afford the additional fees, and this is being exacerbated by the roll-out of Universal Credit. ""In the end, this means that the [30-hours] scheme is not always reaching the most vulnerable families."" The APPG report said: ""Should this trend continue, we risk facing a situation where only wealthy families are able to access childcare services, leading to significant reductions in educational opportunities for children, as well as more challenges to parents looking to go back into work."" According to the National Day Nurseries Association, the rate at which early years providers are closing has increased by 66% since the introduction of the scheme, and they are closing fastest in more deprived areas. Tulip Siddiq MP, chairwoman of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Childcare and Early Education, said: ""We know that the early years are hugely important to a child's physical and mental development and future life chances. ""However, there is a significant body of evidence to demonstrate that childcare providers are battling to achieve and maintain financial sustainability, and that government policies are a major cause of this challenge."" Children and Families Minister Nadham Zahawi said there had been a huge increase in the number of children benefitting from 30 hours free childcare. He added that this meant parents were spending less on childcare and could work more flexibly.

"Linthorpe Road is a main through route in the town In Middlesbrough, a bag of heroin can cost as little as Â£5. It is not the only town in England to see problems with the drug and homelessness. BBC Tees reporter Adam Clarkson spent an evening on the streets with people who wanted to tell their stories. ""You want hardcore? I'll show you hardcore."" Longshank is 46 years old. That's not his real name but how he wants to be referred to. He's homeless and has promised to ""show me the ropes"". About five years ago, he found himself sleeping rough. He had struggled with alcohol addiction for years, but said it was the death of his wife that saw his life spiral out of control. ""She was my partner in crime, the best thing that ever happened to me. I was with her 31 years. It broke my heart,"" he said. He's drinking a two-litre bottle of cider when we meet. He drinks at least one every day. ""I get wrecked just to get numb. I can't face the music,"" he adds, ""But life has to go on."" He describes his life as ""horrendous"". Discarded needles and syringes are easy to find Two days ago, somebody threw a bucket of urine at him. ""It was in the middle of Linthorpe Road. I was just sat there. They swilled me. You wouldn't believe it. I've never been so humiliated."" We walk to the same spot when a drunk man, who is known to Longshank, becomes aggressive towards me. Things become heated, but calm down as the man bursts into tears. He says he and his partner recently lost a baby, and are facing the prospect of becoming homeless. Evidence of drug use can be found in many back streets I am told that arguments and violence ""come with the territory"". Longshank then shows me ""the bedroom department"" - a sheltered car park behind a restaurant, where many rough sleepers congregate. This is where I meet a 22-year-old who introduces himself as Little Man. Little Man says he has been using heroin since the age of 12. ""It's upsetting. I didn't have to go down this route. It breaks my heart, I could do more with my life. There's guaranteed to be a drug dealer within 100ft,"" Little Man says. The bins where homeless people sometimes sleep I watch as Little Man, Longshank and a number of others pass around a bag of heroin. The powder is melted, mixed with vinegar and put into a syringe. One man injects himself in his groin. Tom Le Ruez, Middlesbrough Council's drug-related deaths co-ordinator, says mixing vinegar is ""not a particularly good idea"". ""It isn't advised that people inject at all, but injecting in environments like dark alleys increases the risk that people will damage their veins."" A bag of heroin costs as little as Â£5, I am told. Little Man says it's very easy to find. A member of staff comes out of the back door of the restaurant. She tells me Longshank is ""no bother"", but other people are known to start fires and defecate behind their bins. People on the streets try to find shelter where they can Three men arrive and ask if anybody wants to buy drugs. The atmosphere becomes tense when they realise I'm a journalist. Longshank says we need to leave, so we go back to Linthorpe Road. Longshank tells me he was given a flat by the local authority, but it was taken off him when he chose to sleep rough instead. ""I had appointments the next morning at the other side of town. I couldn't walk all that way to walk back again; there's no method in the madness."" I ask Longshank if he's using that as an excuse. He tells me it's possible he is. ""I'd miss all of these guys. It's not all doom and gloom, you know? We have a giggle. The streets are addictive, it is an addiction. It's worse than a drug."" In 2018, the North East saw the second biggest rise in rough sleepers, with a 29% increase. Despite this, the wider region has had the lowest number of rough sleepers in the country since the government began collecting data with an ""annual single-night snapshot"" in 2010. But Tracy Guy from Shelter said the true scale of homelessness in the North East is ""largely hidden from view"" as people are ""trapped in temporary accommodation or sofa-surfing with friends and family"". 'We know how brilliant Middlesbrough is' The team bringing refugees together The mystery around who Clucky is Radio 1's Big Weekend recreated in wool Little Mix, The 1975 and Miley Cyrus performed in the town for Radio 1's Big Weekend According to Middlesbrough Council, there are 11 rough sleepers in the town. That number has risen every year since 2016. The town has seen drug-related mental health hospital admissions rise from 16 per 100,000 people in 2013-14 to 43 in 2016-17. Debbie Cochrane, Middlesbrough Council's homeless lead, says help is offered to them every week. ""If they say no, that's fine,"" she says, ""but it doesn't mean we're going to stop trying because one week they might say 'I don't want to live like this any more' and that's when they would be welcomed with open arms. ""That's their life and we're not here to judge. It's not up to us to say 'that's wrong'. If that's how they want to live then that's fine, but the opportunity is there to break away - if that's what they want to do."" Longshank and I part ways. I go home, and he continues the cycle of begging, buying drugs and using them. ""Every day, it's the same"" he says. ""It's like space invaders. It's a game.""

"Rivals for the presidency, Margrethe Vestager (liberal, Danish); Frans Timmermans (centre-left, Dutch); Manfred Weber (centre-right, German) EU leaders meeting in Brussels remain divided over who should get the EU's top jobs, and talks have been suspended until Tuesday. They are arguing mainly over a successor to Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker. They had hoped to get a deal on Sunday night. Diplomats say summit chair Donald Tusk proposed Dutch centre-left politician Frans Timmermans to succeed Mr Juncker. Centre-right Bulgarian Kristalina Georgieva would replace Mr Tusk. Late on Sunday the summit was suspended so that Mr Tusk could hold bilateral talks, seeking a breakthrough. Talks then resumed over breakfast on Monday but were later suspended until 11:00 (09:00 GMT) Tuesday. The talks went on late into the night, testing the stamina of journalists Both German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron said choosing the candidates was now more complicated because the May European elections had ended the traditional centre-left and centre-right dominance of EU politics. ""When you have not just two partners, but three or four, the issue is not clearly defined,"" Mrs Merkel told reporters, admitting that the disagreement ""looks bad"". ""But a compromise must be found - historically it's immaterial if this takes a bit longer."" The May elections saw big gains for the liberals - including Mr Macron's alliance - and Greens, as well as for nationalists. But no group has a majority. What are the clear trends from EU elections? President Macron told reporters: ""we must learn from this setback - we're projecting an image of Europe which isn't serious, and we need better preparation for these meetings"". He lamented that ""what's lacking is a feeling and duty to defend Europe as a whole"". The rare Sunday summit was called because EU leaders failed on 20 June to agree on candidates for the Commission president's job and other top posts: European Council president (to replace Donald Tusk); High Representative for foreign policy (to replace Federica Mogherini); European Parliament president and European Central Bank president. This video can not be played Latvian PM Krisjanis Karins calls for national and gender balance Ms Georgieva was proposed to succeed Mr Tusk. She is an economist and ex-EU Commissioner, who has been chief executive of the World Bank since 2017. Mr Juncker's successor to run the Commission will be responsible for proposing new EU laws, enforcing the bloc's rules and handling trade deals. But Mr Timmermans, currently a deputy to Mr Juncker, faces stiff opposition from eastern European states and centre-right leaders from the EU's biggest political group, the European People's Party (EPP). In the proposed compromise, the EPP's candidate to head the Commission, Germany's Manfred Weber, would instead become European Parliament president. He might split the five-year term with liberal leader Guy Verhofstadt. The deal would put a liberal in charge of EU foreign policy, either Danish EU Commissioner Margrethe Vestager or Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel. All of the EU's top jobs are changing hands this year, after the May elections. The BBC's Adam Fleming in Brussels writes: The first priority for EU leaders (and reporters) is to get some sleep after more than 17 hours of debating, haggling, guessing, fighting and fruitlessly searching for compromise. The next is to agree a package of candidates for the top jobs before the European Parliament presses ahead and elects its president on Wednesday, which would reduce the national leaders' room for manoeuvre, by allocating one of the prizes. Of course the deadlock will be broken at some point - there will be a candidate for the job of Commission president eventually, and it probably won't even be a surprise. Old hands say this is nothing new. But plenty of people have started to ask whether this way of making decisions is sustainable, in a fragmented EU where no single person, party, institution or ideology has the power to make things happen. The choices have to take account of the elections and achieve an acceptable balance regarding large and small states, gender and geography. The European Parliament wants the leaders to stick to the ""Spitzenkandidat"" (lead candidate) procedure launched in 2014, under which those nominated by the most successful parties in the elections get the top posts. But President Macron is among those opposing the EPP's Manfred Weber and the ""Spitzenkandidat"" process. This video can not be played Who's in the running for Juncker's post and other EU top jobs? Politicians in Poland, Hungary and Romania meanwhile dislike the way Mr Timmermans, a veteran of Brussels politics, hasenforced the EU rule of law policy. Who is in the running for the EU's top job? Hungary's government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs tweeted,externalthat appointing Mr Timmermans to the top EU job was ""completely unacceptable"". The top EU appointments - especially for Commission chief - sharpen not only national rivalries but also those between the European Council and the European Parliament, which is the only directly elected EU institution. Mr Macron stressed the need to nominate two men and two women for the four key posts. The fifth - parliament president - is mainly in the hands of MEPs. The EU's Donald Tusk and Federica Mogherini will both have left by December The EU treaties say the government leaders - the European Council - have to nominate a Commission president, then MEPs vote on that candidate. The choice is made by qualified majority - that is: if 72% of member states vote in favour (21 out of the 28) and those states represent at least 65% of the total EU population The pressure is on: at their 15-18 July session, MEPs are to vote on the EU leaders' nominee, who is to take office on 1 November. The European Council president is to be elected by the EU leaders by qualified majority, and should take office on 1 December. He/she chairs EU summits and steers the bloc's broad strategy, while the Commission deals with the fine details. The High Representative for foreign policy runs the EU External Action Service (EEAS), dealing with major challenges such as Iran's nuclear programme, Kosovo and EU interventions in Africa. A favourite to become ECB president, taking over from Mario Draghi, is Jens Weidmann, head of the German Bundesbank. The ECB had to calm markets during the eurozone crisis and manage Greece's severe debt problems. The bank has enormous influence, given continuing concern about the euro. The European Parliament president steers MEPs' debates and their votes on most EU legislation. 'My job's hell': Who'll be next EC president?
