"Manchester has resisted being put into the ""very high risk"" tier Early in the pandemic, the government consistently said it was ""following the science"" - but what does that really mean, and is the divergence between politics and science now wider than it has ever been? Some with heels clacking on the cobbles, others capturing the moment on their phones - it's like the aftermath of a big win in the football, or the Saturday after pay day. The videos show Concert Square in Liverpool heaving with crowds. And this in a city on the crest of a second wave of coronavirus, where almost all the intensive care beds in the hospitals are full. It was Tuesday night, hours away from the Liverpool City Region entering the toughest restrictions in the country. But the footage sparked anger, and on Twitter there was a fight over the damage to the city's reputation. This video can not be played Crowds gather in Liverpool on eve of new Covid rules Dozens of tweets insisted that those present must have been students, that no true Liverpudlian would set foot in Concert Square, let alone behave like that. The tweeters were adamant - these people came from outside. The mayor and the metro mayor condemned the scenes - but that wasn't the only thing they were angry about. They accused the government at Westminster of not providing enough financial support - workers affected by the closure of businesses such as bars and gyms will only get two-thirds of their wages. On the first day of lockdown,one gym ownershowed his defiance by remaining open and was fined for it. Gyms have indeed provided a source of confusion. Liverpool mayor Joe Anderson questioned why gyms in the Liverpool City Region had to close when the area moved into tier three - very high alert - but those in Lancashire, which went into tier three on Saturday, were allowed to stay open. Liverpool was the first place in England to go into the strictest measures In Blackburn, with 438 cases per 100,000 (in the week to 13 October), you can work out, but in Wirral, with 284 cases per 100,000, you can't. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has acknowledged inconsistencies. ""There are anomalies, that's inevitably going to happen in a complex campaign against a pandemic like this."" But do these discrepancies encourage those who feel the government's decision-making sometimes veers away from the science? ""Following the science"" was a phrase we heard a lot of earlier in the year. It's what, we were repeatedly told, the government at Westminster was doing. This video can not be played Liverpool pub worker talks emotionally about job fears The reality was always more nuanced. There was a range of scientific views on a topic about which precious little was known at the outset, and there are still vast amounts to learn. Added to that, from the perspective of ministers, this could never only be about scientific advice. There was a constant swirl of broader considerations, what we might call the three Ls - lives, liberties and livelihoods. Ministers have been tussling with the three Ls from the start of the pandemic. But the divergence has never been wider than it is now. Nick Triggle is the BBC's health correspondent@NickTriggle,external Chris Mason is a BBC political correspondent@ChrisMasonBBC,external Claire Hamilton is the BBC's political reporter for Merseyside@chamiltonbbc,external The critical moment in recent weeks can be traced back to 21 September, when Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK's chief scientific adviser and Prof Chris Whitty, the UK's chief medical adviser, warned of the need for immediate action. In a televised briefing, Sir Patrick warned cases could reach 50,000 a day by mid-October if they doubled every seven days, as had happened in recent weeks. Chris Whitty and Patrick Vallance on 21 September We now know that on that same day, the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) met and suggested the ""immediate introduction"" of a ""short period of lockdown,"" and a series of longer term measures, including: working from home where possible ""banning all contact within the home with members of other households"" ""closure of all bars, restaurants, cafes, indoor gyms"" and hairdressers all university and college teaching moved online. A day later, what actually happened? The prime minister said people should work from home if they could and a 22:00 curfew for pubs and restaurants was introduced. In other words, not a lot of change. What happened to ""following the science""? Plenty at Westminster whispered, even before we had seen the minutes from the Sage meeting, that this was a victory for those in government, like Chancellor Rishi Sunak, who worried about the pandemic's crippling economic consequences. What Covid tier is my area in? Mr Sunak has been consistent - warning again, just this week, of the danger of ""rushing to another lockdown"". He warned, instead, of the ""economic emergency"", touching on another of the three Ls - livelihoods. When you speak to people in the Treasury, you get an insight into what informs this outlook. ""We have to keep an eye on the medium term. There may not be a vaccine. Listening to the scientists recently, the mood music has changed. They're more pessimistic,"" says one. This is no longer about dealing with a short-term emergency, but being resilient through a medium or long-term slog of a crisis. And that means the Treasury is well aware of what is going out - in public spending - and what is coming in, in taxes. ""There isn't the headroom there was,"" an insider says - a reference to the Â£200bn already spent. And there is a keen awareness of the economic consequences of shutting pubs. ""Our economy is comparatively very reliant on social consumption,"" is how it is described. The experts know the ministers have to take into account a variety of factors. One Sage member said: ""Our job is to give clear unvarnished science advice so they can do that with their eyes open."" On Tuesday, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer advocated a short, limited lockdown - the circuit-breaker suggested by the scientific advisers. But does Sir Keir calling for a circuit-breaker make it more or less likely to happen? Since then, the government - to quote Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab - has been ""leaning in"" to its regional response for England. Political convention says, everything else being equal, it is harder to adopt a policy advocated by your opponents than it is by independent advisers. Then there's the last of the three Ls. Liberties. Boris Johnson, 21 September 2020 Among the most influential Conservative backbench voices is Sir Graham Brady, who said ministers had got used to ""ruling by decree"" and ""the British people aren't used to being treated like children"". This unease at how the pandemic has, in their view, swept away some of the checks and balances on those in power, is widely held in Parliament. Then there's the question of geography. First there was devolution for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, but now we're all aware of the big English cities that have metro mayors because they are fighting back against Westminster. According to well-placed sources, Health Secretary Matt Hancock had argued for tougher measures in private. But the need to get local leaders on board has meant the tiered system has had to leave some wriggle room for negotiation. Ministers were stung when Middlesbrough mayor Andy Preston said he flatly rejected the restrictions that the government announced there in early October. ""It was a real problem for us - it undermined the public health message and threatened to undo what we were trying to achieve,"" one government source said. Steve Rotheram, Metro Mayor of the Liverpool City Region, had been asking for a lockdown circuit-breaker for at least two weeks - but he said any measures must come with a bespoke financial support package for businesses. It appears this hasn't been forthcoming. Andy Burnham outside Manchester town hall this week But the mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, has gone much further than his colleague in Liverpool. On Friday, he was described as ""effectively trying to hold the government over a barrel"" by Mr Raab. Mr Burnham, a former Labour cabinet minister, who lost out to Jeremy Corbyn in the 2015 Labour leadership contest, is suddenly back on the national stage. He is demanding noisily and frequently the need for more generous support for those unable to work because of tier three restrictions. There is nervousness within the Labour Party nationally, and elsewhere in the north of England, about this stance. Some worry it imperils people's health, others that it's become ""the Andy show"" - as one figure put it. The idea of ""metro mayors"" voted for directly by the people of the region has long been championed by the Conservatives. David Cameron was a particular fan. This video can not be played Top SAGE scientist tells us the regional restriction row is dangerous Newscast: Top scientist warning over 'damaging' political row Listen to Newscast on BBC Sounds ""Some Conservatives are now realising you've got to be careful what you wish for,"" an early advocate of them says. ""And remember this, Boris Johnson was a mayor. There is a path to Downing Street that can pass via a town hall. Perhaps Andy Burnham has realised that too."" What we are seeing is how different parts of the UK have tilted in different directions. Loyalty to region, to nation, to party. The legacies of past perceived slights and injustices. The realities of perceived injustices now. ""We owe a big thanks to George Osborne for bequeathing us this incredible standoff,"" a senior Conservative says about the row. Some Conservative ministers ponder privately that - in the end - Mr Sunak will be forced to be more generous to those unable to work under tier three restrictions. They don't think it'll be politically sustainable to pay people normally on the minimum wage, less than the minimum wage, for months on end. The rows between local and central government leaders are ""very dangerous"" and ""very damaging to public health"", according to Prof Sir Jeremy Farrar, Sage member, and director of the Wellcome Trust. But these are not the only rows that have been taking place. Across the scientific and medical community tempers are frayed and the pandemic is taking its toll. There is a network of committees that feed into Sage, bringing together a wide range of experts from sociologists and public health directors to epidemiologists. Many are not paid for their advice and instead are fitting it in around their day jobs. ""We do it because we care and it's our life's work,"" said Prof Devi Sridhar, an expert in global public health at Edinburgh University, who has been advising the Scottish government. Talk to these experts and it is clear they are exhausted. ""The requests just keep coming in,"" one said. ""We're fed up, especially when we hear that test-and-trace consultants are getting paid Â£7,000 a day, and we have to put up with MPs going on the TV telling the world we are naÃ¯ve and don't live in the real world. It's demoralising."" But it is not just between politicians and scientists that disputes have developed. Rival camps of scientists are clashing. Two online petitions have now been established: the Great Barrington declaration for those who want to see controlled spread of the virus and protection of the vulnerable, and the John Snow Memorandum for those arguing for outright suppression until a vaccine is developed. Prof Francois Balloux, director of the UCL Genetics Institute, says the toxic atmosphere that is developing is really ""unhelpful"". Brought together, it has created a climate where almost every utterance or development is examined for double-meaning. The problem facing advisers and decision-makers is two-fold. First, the nature of the virus means it is a lose-lose situation - whatever decision is taken has negative consequences either for the spread of the virus, or for the economy, education and wider health and well-being. What's more, there is not a simple binary choice of one thing or the other. For example, much has been made in recent weeks about the need for the NHS to also focus on non-Covid work, which has taken a terrible hit during the pandemic. Referrals for urgent cancer check-ups and the number of people starting treatment have dropped, while the amount of routine surgery being done is still half the level it was before the pandemic. THREE TIERS:How will the system work? SOCIAL DISTANCING:Can I give my friends a hug? PAY-PACKET SUPPORT:What will I be paid under the new scheme? SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? This can have tragic consequences. This week the British Heart Foundation warned the number of younger adults dying of heart disease had increased by 15% during the pandemic. The argument put forward by some is that the government should choose to do more non-Covid work. But, and this is a point the health secretary has been making week after week, if hospitals fill up with coronavirus patients, it makes non-Covid work harder to do. The second key issue - and this goes to the heart of the disagreements we have seen bubble up in recent weeks among the scientific and medical community - is that there are huge gaps in the evidence and knowledge. This is true on everything from the numbers infected already and the level of immunity exposure brings to the true impact of ""long Covid"", and exactly what effect any restrictions beyond a full lockdown actually have. In normal times, the scientific and medical community is able to reach more of a consensus off the back of rigorous randomised controlled trials and painstaking peer review. But in a fast-moving pandemic with a new virus, that has simply not been possible. Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia, says it means there is such ""uncertainty in the science"" that he does not think any plan is guaranteed to work. And then there is the human factor - the unintended consequences of actions that are impossible to take into account in the modelling. Hence the prospect of scenes like the ones we saw in Liverpool, which were not taken into account by Sage in its latest advice. But Prof Keith Neal, an infectious disease expert at Nottingham University, says it shouldn't come as a surprise that people react in the way they do. Both young and old are suffering, he says, from not being able to meet up with people. ""This degree of isolation is not allowed in prisons under human rights legislation."" People from different households will not be able to drink together inside, after London went into tier two It is, he says, therefore natural that some people will ignore the rules. Closing pubs may sound good on paper, he says, but it could lead to an increase in house parties where people are ""far more at risk"". So where has this left us? The complexity of competing interests, uncertainty in the science and general exhaustion across society both among decision-makers and the public has, some fear, left us in the worst of both worlds. Delay and deliberation, says Sir Jeremy Farrar is a ""decision in itself"". But by reaching a decision by default there is a risk - another adviser says - of making the same mistakes we made at the start of the pandemic. ""In March we toyed with the Swedish model of limited restrictions with the hope of developing immunity and then hesitated. But we then went for a lockdown, but it was introduced bit by bit and it was too late anyway. ""The same thing has happened again - we have delayed and then gone for some half measures. I can understand why. This is bloody difficult."" The government is now hoping it will be just enough that we can get through this wave without a devastating number of deaths or hospitals being overwhelmed. But it's a big risk - it could all unravel.

"A man removes debris in the Nagorno-Karabakh capital, Stepanakert Armenia and Azerbaijan have accused each other of violating a humanitarian ceasefire in the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh. Both sides agreed had agreed a truce to start at midnight local time (20:00 GMT Saturday). But an Armenian defence ministry spokeswoman said Azerbaijan broke the ceasefire after just four minutes by firing artillery shells and rockets. Azerbaijan later said Armenia had broken the truce after two minutes. Both countries signed a Russian-brokered ceasefire last Saturday. However, clashes continued despite that accord. Fighting flared last month over the territory, which is internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan but run by ethnic Armenians. Hundreds have died. This is the worst violence in the region since a six-year war over the territory ended with a ceasefire in 1994. What are Armenia and Azerbaijan fighting over? Karabakh war leaves civilians shell-shocked and bitter Nagorno-Karabakh conflict in pictures Earlier on Saturday, both nations continued to trade accusations over violations of the Russian-brokered truce agreed last weekend and doubts are likely to remain following the latest statements. Both nations confirmed the humanitarian truce, although few other details were given. Azerbaijan's foreign ministry said the decision was based on statements by the presidents of the US, France and Russia, representing the OSCE Minsk Group - a body set up in 1992 and chaired by the three countries to mediate the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. Rescue workers at the scene of damage in the Azerbaijani city of Ganja Anna Naghdalyan, spokesperson for Armenia's foreign ministry carried the same statement in a tweet, adding it welcomed efforts towards a ""ceasefire and de-escalation of tension"" in the conflict zone. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, who negotiated last weekend's accord, spoke to counterparts in both countries on Saturday and said they needed to ""strictly follow"" the earlier agreement. French President Emmanuel Macron agreed, saying his country would pay ""close attention"" to the ceasefire. ""The enemy fired artillery shells in the northern direction from 00:04 to 02:45, (20:04 to 22:45 GMT Saturday) and fired rockets in the southern direction from 02:20 to 02:45,"" Armenian defence ministry spokeswoman Shushan Stepanyan said on Twitter. She later said that Azerbaijan launched an assault in the south of Nagorno-Karabakh on Sunday morning. ""There are casualties and wounded on both sides."" Speaking with the BBC, Armenia's Foreign Minister Zohrab Mnatsakanyan said his country was not responsible for breaking the ceasefire, and accused Azerbaijan of not being interested in a de-escalation. ""This has been exactly the policy of Azerbaijan... to exchange blame and to get the licence to continue the aggression,"" said Mr Mnatsakanyan. Meanwhile Hikmat Hajiyev, foreign policy chief in the presidency of Azerbaijan, blamed Armenia for the renewed fight. ""[Armenia is] misusing and misinterpreting the current ceasefire regime to reinforce their positions and to capture new territories of Azerbaijan,"" Mr Hajiyev told the BBC. ""Yesterday they ambushed a group of Azerbaijan armed forces and tried to kill them ""These are questions that the Armenian side needs to answer,"" he added. This video can not be played A ceasefire agreement last Saturday failed to stop the killing in Nagorno-Karabakh Azerbaijan accused Armenia of a missile strike in the early hours of Saturday that killed at least 13 civilians and injured 45 in Ganja, a city far from the front lines. An earlier statement by the foreign ministry accused Armenia of ""deliberate and indiscriminate targeting of civilians"". Armenian officials denied the attack, and accused Azerbaijan of attacking civilian areas. Ms Stepanyan posted a video on Facebook, which she said showed devastation in the Nagorno-Karabakh region, accusing the Azerbaijani Armed Forces of striking at civilians with missiles in areas including the Nagorno-Karabakh capital, Stepanakert.

"A record number of shops closed on UK high streets during the first half of this year as the coronavirus lockdown hit many stores hard, data shows. Some 11,120 chain store outlets shut between January and June, according to research by the Local Data Company and accountancy firm PwC. Although more than 5,000 shops opened during the same period it was not enough to fill the gaps, resulting in a net decline of 6,001 stores. The final total could even be higher. Researchers did not count outlets that had yet to reopen after the coronavirus lockdown ended. Many never will. The data includes shops, hospitality chains, and services such as post offices and banks, but it does not include small independent businesses. High streets were already experiencing upheaval long before the pandemic struck. Shops were closing at an average rate of 16 per day in 2019, according to the Local Data Company, which tracks vacancies rates. But the pandemic is turbo-charging change as more people shop online. The research found that York has been the worst affected area, with a net loss of 55 outlets. Harpenden, in Hertfordshire, meanwhile has fared better than any other location with a net increase in stores. High streets have borne the brunt of the closures. Retail parks have proved far more resilient. Standalone stores mean units which are out of town, but not in a retail park or shopping centre, for instance a large supermarket or an Ikea. The Local Data Company and PwC have been analysing the changes in the top 500 shopping locations for the past decade. This year's findings include all high streets, shopping centres and retail parks in Britain. They've reviewed existing data to allow comparisons with the previous five years. These new figures show the profound impact the pandemic is having on our town centres and high streets. ""For local authorities, it's now critical how they respond to this significant and growing decline in store occupants,"" says Lucy Stainton, head of retail and strategic partnerships at the Local Data Company. Whilst many city centres remain quiet, the pandemic has prompted something of a resurgence in local high streets with people increasingly wanting to shop locally if they're working from home. Lisa Hooker, consumer markets leader at PwC, says amid the turmoil, there continues to be a steady flow of openings:  ""With the continued roll out of value retailers, the boom in takeaways and pizza delivery shops and demand for services that can still only be delivered locally, such as tradesmen outlets, building products or locksmiths, shows that despite the stark numbers there remains a future for physical stores. ""It's likely that whatever happens retail will come out of this smaller and stronger,"" she believes. A thousand more shop workers' jobs to go More closures are still to come, however. Retailers and hospitality chains are continuing to restructure their businesses, cutting stores and many thousands of jobs to survive. Many have done deals with landlords to reduce rent bills, but billions of pounds of rent still remains unpaid thanks to the government ban on evictions to give struggling firms some breathing space, arrears which have only been postponed. Another key factor is business rates. Thanks to the government's rates holiday, retail and hospitality firms don't have to start paying this tax again till April next year. They say if it isn't extended, this could deal a final blow for the viability of many stores. Correction:an earlier version of the first graphic showed the worst performing cities in the wrong order.

"A tree-lined street in Camden, north London Urban areas are not all high-rise flats and offices, they are also where you'll find many of the country's trees.Â Two London boroughs - Camden and Croydon - were among the top 20 places in England and Wales with the most tree cover, a research project has found. Meanwhile largely rural areas had some of the least - including part of the Lake District and the Yorkshire Dales.Â Garden trees are boosting numbers in towns, while farming helps explain some of the low rural rankings. Bluesky International, an aerial survey company who carried out the work with the help of mapping specialist Esri UK, say they have detected around 400 million trees so far - but there are still more to find. Â In Camden and CroydonÂ almost a third of the borough is covered in trees.Â Croydon has several areas of woodland and Camden includes Hampstead Heath and Primrose Hill. But when the data is mapped you can see the distinct pattern of tree lined streets and trees in gardens that help push up the percentage.Â Surrey Heath has the largest percentage of trees. But the area ""has seen quite a recent transformation,"" John Tucker from the Woodland Trust says. ""If you look back 60, 80, 100 years a lot of this area was open heathland and would have been managed and grazed.""Â But as livestock farming became less economical the area has returned to woodland.Â The place with the lowest tree cover is South Holland - an area of mainly farmland on The Wash in Lincolnshire.Â It is closely followed by neighbouring Boston.Â  Â This part of the east coast, all the way to East Yorkshire, features in the bottom 20 areas.Â ""These areas were swept of trees for farming and have never recovered,"" says Dr Paul Brindley,Â an expert in trees and planning at Sheffield University's Department of Landscape Architecture. A treeless landscape in South Holland, Lincolnshire But perhaps more surprising are that areas in the bottom 20 include parts of the Yorkshire Dales National Park and an area of the Lake District.Â Richmondshire and Craven between them cover a large part of the Yorkshire Dales but have only 6% tree cover. Eden, an area that includes Ullswater and parts of the North Pennine area of outstanding national beauty has just 7%.Â â¨ After the ice-age this area would have been 80-90% trees according to Peter Leeson from the Woodland Trust.Â But the demand for wood over history has meant trees have been felled and used for everything from wood fuel to building mines.Â Many areas have also been cleared to make way for fields for animals to graze and sheep can have a secondary effect of eating new trees before they get a chance to establish.Â View over the north Pennines Dr Brindley says it is important to know where the trees are because it can help assess their impact.Â ""It's not just like there's one thing they're providing benefits for - there are a wide range of benefits."" Studies show green spaces and trees in particular can help improve people's health and wellbeing as well as helpingÂ with bio-diversity. Bees in particular like trees. They also play an important role in cooling our urban areas which often generate more heat than the surrounding rural areas because of the number of buildings, people and vehicles. Cllr Adam Harrison, cabinet member on Camden Council believes trees play an important role in the wellbeing of people in his borough. ""They can improve air and water quality, reduce noise pollution, support wildlife and are fantastic for improving mental and physical health"" he says. The data shows which areas benefit from having trees in gardens like this area in Sheffield Surrey Heath Waverley Bracknell Forest Runnymede Woking Mole Valley Elmbridge Guildford Neath Port Talbot New Forest Mid Sussex Rushmoor Hart South Bucks Reigate and Banstead Camden Cannock Chase Croydon Chichester Epsom and Ewell Tunbridge Wells South Holland Boston Fenland Barrow-in-Furness City of London Thanet East Riding of Yorkshire East Cambridgeshire Craven North Kesteven East Lindsey Richmondshire Hartlepool Fylde Isle of Anglesey North Lincolnshire Rochford North East Lincolnshire Eden Rossendale The trees have been detected using machine learning. Bluesky International combine their own high resolution aerial photographs, terrain maps and surface maps.Â Using these three data sources and a machine learning algorithm they can work out which objects are trees and which are not. From this they create their National Tree Map which has been mapped by Esri UK. They believe they have a good estimate for tree cover in different parts of the country but they cannot put an exact figure on the number of trees in England and Wales.Â *Tree cover maps produced by Irene de la Torre UK forests 'could do more harm than good' The ancient oak tree that taught the world a lesson.

Rescue workers at the scene of damage in the Azerbaijani city of Ganja Anna Naghdalyan, spokesperson for Armenia's foreign ministry carried the same statement in a tweet, adding it welcomed efforts towards a ""ceasefire and de-escalation of tension"" in the conflict zone. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, who negotiated last weekend's accord, spoke to counterparts in both countries on Saturday and said they needed to ""strictly follow"" the earlier agreement. French President Emmanuel Macron agreed, saying his country would pay ""close attention"" to the ceasefire. ""The enemy fired artillery shells in the northern direction from 00:04 to 02:45, (20:04 to 22:45 GMT Saturday) and fired rockets in the southern direction from 02:20 to 02:45,"" Armenian defence ministry spokeswoman Shushan Stepanyan said on Twitter. She later said that Azerbaijan launched an assault in the south of Nagorno-Karabakh on Sunday morning. ""There are casualties and wounded on both sides."" Speaking with the BBC, Armenia's Foreign Minister Zohrab Mnatsakanyan said his country was not responsible for breaking the ceasefire, and accused Azerbaijan of not being interested in a de-escalation. ""This has been exactly the policy of Azerbaijan... to exchange blame and to get the licence to continue the aggression,"" said Mr Mnatsakanyan. Meanwhile Hikmat Hajiyev, foreign policy chief in the presidency of Azerbaijan, blamed Armenia for the renewed fight. ""[Armenia is] misusing and misinterpreting the current ceasefire regime to reinforce their positions and to capture new territories of Azerbaijan,"" Mr Hajiyev told the BBC. ""Yesterday they ambushed a group of Azerbaijan armed forces and tried to kill them ""These are questions that the Armenian side needs to answer,"" he added. This video can not be played A ceasefire agreement last Saturday failed to stop the killing in Nagorno-Karabakh Azerbaijan accused Armenia of a missile strike in the early hours of Saturday that killed at least 13 civilians and injured 45 in Ganja, a city far from the front lines. An earlier statement by the foreign ministry accused Armenia of ""deliberate and indiscriminate targeting of civilians"". Armenian officials denied the attack, and accused Azerbaijan of attacking civilian areas. Ms Stepanyan posted a video on Facebook, which she said showed devastation in the Nagorno-Karabakh region, accusing the Azerbaijani Armed Forces of striking at civilians with missiles in areas including the Nagorno-Karabakh capital, Stepanakert.

"Exeter and Racing 92 were both attempting to lift their first Champions Cup title Heineken Champions Cup final: Exeter (21) 31 Tries:Cowan-Dickie, S Simmonds, Williams, SladeCons:J Simmonds 4Pen:J Simmonds Racing 92 (12) 27 Tries:Zebo 2, Imhoff, ChatCons:Russell, MachenaudPen:Machenaud Exeter Chiefs had just enough to keep Racing 92 at bay and clinch their first Heineken Champions Cup title in a thrilling final at Ashton Gate. Luke-Cowan Dickie, Sam Simmonds and Harry Williams barged over to give Exeter a nine-point lead at the break. But Racing roared back with Simon Zebo's second try and Camille Chat's surge bringing them within a point. Exeter, down to 14 men after Tomas Francis' late yellow card, held out heroically to lift the title. A breathless final 10 minutes featured Racing turning down the drop-goal opportunity as they went through the phases within five metres of the line, Exeter replacement Sam Hidalgo-Clyne securing a turnover under the shadow of his own posts and captain Joe Simmonds landing a penalty with the last act of the match. Even then the drama was not over. The match clock initially showed that three seconds remained for Racing to restart and mount a final assault. However, after consulting with his team officials, referee Nigel Owens confirmed that the clock had not restarted when Simmonds was lining up his penalty and that he could blow up, sparking delirious celebrations. The victory marks the culmination of a remarkable decade for Exeter, who won promotion to the Premiership for the first time back in 2010 in a play-off match across Bristol at the city's Memorial Stadium. Rob Baxter's side will attempt to complete a double next weekend when they take on Wasps in the Premiership final. Emotional Baxter hails Exeter's 'ability to stick at it' Reaction and analysis after Exeter clinch first Champions Cup From Championship to Champions Cup - Exeter's meteroic rise Racing emerged for kick-off in the pink bow-ties that are a club tradition The clash of styles was clear as soon as the teams emerged into a coronavirus-enforced empty Ashton Gate. Racing 92 trotted onto the pitch wearing pink bow-ties, in a nod to the Parisians' fast-living free-running past. Exeter marched out in business-like fashion, grim-faced and forward looking, through a gauntlet of their replacements and backroom staff. Racing brought bursts of colour and panache, but the Chiefs' mastery of close-range trench warfare ultimately kept them one step ahead throughout a thrilling contest. Racing scrum-half Teddy Iribaren had the chance to give his side an early platform. Instead he screwed a penalty dead as he aimed for the corner and five minutes later Cowan-Dickie forced his way through the middle of a driven maul for the first try. Iribaren's eccentricities continued as he passed blind to put Juan Imhoff under pressure before Russell juggled in his own in-goal area. Racing put themselves under pressure and Exeter gleefully pressed them beyond breaking point. Sam Simmonds barged through opposite number Antonie Claassen at the end of a series of short-range bursts from his fellow forwards. Fourteen points ahead with only 16 minutes gone, Exeter chairman Tony Rowe looked like he was struggling to keep his delight in check in the stands. But Racing refused to go quietly. Russell's cut-out pass tempted Tom O'Flaherty out of position and opened a route to the corner for Zebo before Imhoff ghosted through the fringe defence to cut the gap to two points. Harry Williams crossed on the stroke of half-time for Chiefs but Zebo, out of contract next summer, showed his quality with another powerful finish to keep the French side within a score early in the second half. Ultimately though, Racing's errors undermined their brilliance. Two minutes after Zebo's second, with the momentum with the French side, Scotland fly-half Russell threw a looping mis-pass just outside his own 22m. It could have sprung a counter-attack. Instead it was picked off by an alert Jack Nowell who put Henry Slade under the posts. That score moved Exeter to 28 points, a total Racing could never overhaul despite Chat's bulldozing try and their late pressure. Russell's brilliance helped create a late semi-final winning try against Saracens British and Irish Lions coach Warren Gatland was one of the handful of spectators in attendance at the behind-closed-doors final. The performance of Russell will have given him plenty to ponder. The Scotland fly-half's brilliant chip created a dramatic late score that undid defending champions Saracens in the semi-final and there were moments of vision and precision against Exeter. However, his high-risk, high-reward game means costly errors are also inevitable. Even before his pass was intercepted for Slade's try, his juggle behind his own line had almost gifted Exeter a score in the first half. Will Gatland feel he can afford that trade-off in the white heat of a Test series against world champions South Africa next summer? Second row Jonny Hill's Herculean performance included 16 tackles - more than any other Exeter player Sam Simmonds named European player of the year Former England scrum-half Matt Dawson on BBC Radio 5 Live:""It's an amazing achievement for Exeter. There can't have been another winning team that have only been in the top flight of their league for 10 years. And they deserve it because they have been the best team in Europe by some distance. ""I don't think I've seen a final like that - they tend to be more cagey. When a team goes as far ahead as Exeter did you think this is a one-way show, but it was Exeter who were hanging on at the end. ""Sport does some strange things to your emotions and there was massive tension and drama even in an empty stadium."" Former England centre Jeremy Guscott:""Well done Racing for coming back into the match but the difference was that Exeter are a team whereas Racing have individuals. Exeter finished the match with 14 players on the field but backed themselves in a defensive position and have won it together."" Allow Twitter content?

"People in England who have been told to self-isolate through NHS Test and Trace could have their details shared with the police on a ""case-by-case basis"". Forces will have access to information telling them if an individual has been told to self-isolate, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said. But the British Medical Association said it was worried police involvement might put people off being tested. In England there is a legal requirement to isolate after a positive test. Police will not have access to data from the NHS Covid-19 app. The app is anonymous so the government does not know who has been sent instructions to self-isolate. Outsourcing firm's profit boost from test-and-trace How does Covid-19 test-and-trace work? Just under 11% of people traced as a close contact of someone with coronavirus said they self-isolated for 14 days, according toa government-commissioned study,external. Reasons given for breaking self-isolation included believing there was no point isolating from strangers if you cannot properly distance from those in your household; not developing symptoms; or visiting shops or a pharmacy. The DHSC updated its guidance about how testing data will be handled on Friday. A memorandum of understanding was issued between the DHSC and National Police Chiefs' Council to allow forces to access information that tells them if a ""specific individual"" has been told to self-isolate, as first reported by theHealth Service Journal,external. Those who fail to do so face fines starting at Â£1,000, which can increase to Â£10,000 for serial offenders or serious breaches. A DHSC spokesman said it was a legal requirement for people who had tested positive and their close contacts to self-isolate when formally notified to do so. ""The memorandum of understanding ensures that information is shared with appropriate safeguards and in accordance with the law. No testing or health data is shared in this process,"" he said. A spokesman for the British Medical Association, which represents doctors in the UK, said the test-and-trace system needed ""the full confidence of the public"" to be effective. He said: ""We are already concerned that some people are deterred from being tested because they are anxious about loss of income should they need to self-isolate - and we are worried should police involvement add to this. ""Therefore, the government's emphasis should be on providing support to people - financial and otherwise - if they need to self-isolate, so that no-one is deterred from coming forward for a test."" LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area THREE TIERS:How will the system work? SOCIAL DISTANCING:Can I give my friends a hug? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? A National Police Chiefs' Council spokesperson said forces would continue to encourage ""voluntary compliance"" but would enforce regulations and issue fines where appropriate. ""Officers will engage with individuals to establish their circumstances, using their discretion wherever it is reasonable to do so,"" they said. Sir Ed Davey, leader of the Liberal Democrats, said ministers should ""reverse the policy urgently"". ""Anything that further undermines the public's dwindling trust in this government's handling of the pandemic is damaging, and few things could have been better designed to do that, than this,"" he said. Meanwhile, Baroness Dido Harding, the head of NHS Test and Trace, hastold the Sunday Times,externalthat the Test and Trace service was not a ""silver bullet"".

"This video can not be played ""I was petrified"" - Det Sgt Nick Bailey on being poisoned by Novichok A police officer who was poisoned in the Salisbury Novichok attack has quit because he ""can no longer do the job"". Det Sgt Nick Bailey was contaminated with the nerve agent at the home of Sergei and Yulia Skripal, the targets of the poisoning operation. After returning to duty last year, he said the aftermath took ""so much from me"" and ""I [have] had to admit defeat"". He worked for the police for 18 years and said he was ""so sad"" after wanting to be an officer since his teens. Angus Macpherson, police and crime commissioner for Wiltshire, where Det Sgt Bailey worked, said throughout his career the officer has symbolised ""dedication and a sense of public duty"". And in a statement, the force said he represents the  ""determination that all of us want to see in police officers across the country"". Allow Twitter content?

Det Sgt Bailey and two Wiltshire Police colleagues were sent to Mr Skripal's home in March 2018, after the former Russian spy and his daughter, who was staying with him, were found seriously ill on a bench in Salisbury. He was contaminated when he touched the door handle of Mr Skripal's home in the city. The Skripals survived the attack after spending several weeks in hospital The Skripals survived the attack, which prompted then Prime Minister Theresa May to tell the House of Commons the operation had ""almost certainly"" been approved by the Russian state. In a series of tweets earlier, Det Sgt Bailey said the impact on him of the attack ""shouldn't be underestimated"". ""I wanted to be a police officer since I was a teenager, I couldn't envisage doing anything else, which is why this makes me so sad,"" he said. ""Like most police officers, I've experienced my fair share of trauma, violence, upset, injury and grief. ""Although I've tried so hard to make it work, I know that I won't find peace whilst remaining in that environment. For me, it's time for a change."" Why Novichok stays deadly for so long Salisbury declared free of Novichok Shock and worry after Novichok case Mr Macpherson thanked Det Sgt Bailey for his ""service and dedication to Wiltshire Police"". ""Nick found himself at the centre of an international, criminal incident which not only affected his health but I am certain changed the course of his family's lives too,"" he said. ""The events in Salisbury and Amesbury back in 2018 remain unprecedented and Nick, himself, has found himself in a situation that no other police officer in this country has been through. ""I know that the force has offered as much welfare support to Nick as possible but I hope today brings Nick and his family some sense of closure and allows them to start to look to the future."" In the months after the attack two Russian nationals were accused of travelling to the UK to try to murder Mr Skripal with novichok. The pair - known by their aliases Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov - were caught on CCTV in Salisbury the day before the attack. The alarm was raised about the Novichok attack when Sergei and Yulia Skripal were found very ill on a bench in the centre of Salisbury Det Sgt Bailey was one of the first to be involved after the alarm about the attack was raised. ""These shocking and unprecedented events changed his life and his family's lives significantly,"" the force said in a statement. ""It is impossible for any of us to fully understand the impact this event has had on Nick and his family, and the sacrifices they made in trying to come to terms with the situation."" ""Day in and day out, officers put themselves directly into harm's way in order to help and protect others,"" the statement continued. ""Nick should be incredibly proud of all that he has achieved and will always be considered to be part of the Wiltshire Police family. ""I am sure that as one chapter closes, another opportunity will open up for Nick.""

"People in Greater Manchester are facing confusion over possible changes to Covid-19 rules, as local leaders denied Downing Street's claim that talks have been arranged to resolve a row. No 10 told the BBC it had arranged a call with the region's mayor, Andy Burnham, on Sunday morning. But Mr Burnham's office said no such call had been scheduled. Tighter rules kicked in for millions of people in Englandon Saturday as areas moved up a tier in a new alert system. BBC political correspondent Jonathan Blake said the conflicting information could be as a result of negotiating tactics. The Department for Health and Social Care confirmed 16,171 more people had tested positive for coronavirus in the UK as of Saturday and a further 150 people had died within 28 days of a positive test - taking the total to 43,579. Prime MinisterBoris Johnson said on Friday that infection rates in Greater Manchester were ""grave""and added: ""Each day that passes before action is taken means more people will go to hospital, more people will end up in intensive care and tragically more people will die."" Mr Burnham and other local leaders have so far resisted a move from tier two to tier three's strict rules on hospitality - pressing instead for more shielding measures for the vulnerable, extra financial aid and stricter local powers to shut down venues breaking virus guidelines. ""We firmly believe that protecting health is about more than controlling the virus and requires proper support for people whose lives would be severely affected by a tier three lockdown,"" the deputy mayors and council leaders said in a joint statement. When two sides cannot even agree on the arrangement of a phone call, it doesn't bode well for the bigger picture. After 48 hours of stand-off between Downing Street and the mayor of Greater Manchester, it seemed there might be some progress. Downing Street claimed they had ""reached out"" and a call had been arranged between Andy Burnham and No 10 for Sunday morning. But soon after that Mr Burnham's spokesperson said nothing had been agreed. These moves could be seen as negotiating tactics, the result of a breakdown in communication or a lack of trust between the two sides. They may also seem like a tedious running commentary on the logistics of negotiations, and on one level it is. But as coronavirus cases continue to rise there is a lot riding on these discussions, or lack thereof. People in Greater Manchester may be wondering how long it will be before action of some sort is taken, and what restrictions they'll be asked to endure when it is. More than half of England - in excess of 28 million people - is now under extra coronavirus restrictions, under the new three-tier alert system. How worried should we be? Make yourself a cuppa and get up to date with the rules Can I stay with my partner in Tier 2? And other questions 'I don't expect to see any friends until 2021' Lancashire has joined the Liverpool City Region in the top tier - tier three. Pubs have closed and households cannot mix indoors or in many outdoor settings. London, Essex, York, Elmbridge, Barrow-in-Furness, North East Derbyshire, Erewash and Chesterfield have moved into tier two, meaning they can no longer mix inside with those from other households, including in pubs and restaurants. Areas of England in the lowest tier must keep to the nationwide virus rules such as group sizes being capped at six people, and the hospitality industry closing at 22:00. Meanwhile, calls for a circuit-breaker - a short but strict national lockdown - have been supported by Labour as well as some Conservative MPs. Kate Green, Labour MP for Stretford and Urmston, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""The Labour leaders in Greater Manchester support the call for a national circuit-break because what we're seeing in Manchester today - the rest of the country is coming along behind. The rate is rising everywhere."" Ms Green, who is also shadow education secretary, added that extra restrictions would not be effective without a package of support to ""enable people to close their businesses [and] to isolate at home if they need to"". Conservative MP and former health secretary Jeremy Hunt called for an end to the ""public war of words"" between local and national leaders on Saturday, but added he had ""sympathy"" for the idea of a circuit-breaker. Britain's largest teachers' union, the National Education Union, has called for secondary schools in England to shut for two weeks at half term, rather than the traditional one week. Mr Johnson has said that while he could not ""rule anything out"", he wants to avoid a national lockdown because of ""the damaging health, economic and social effects it would have"". This video can not be played There were scuffles between police and pub goers in Soho ahead of London moving to Tier 2 As coronavirus cases continue to rise rapidly across the UK, the devolved nations are taking their owns steps to curb the spread of infections. Pubs, restaurants and cafes across Northern Ireland have closedto sit-in customers for the next four weeks whilein Wales, talks continueover a potential two-week ""fire break"" - a period with tighter restrictions to help slow the spread. Most licensed premises in Scotland's central belt are closed under temporary restrictions, which are expected to be replaced by a similar multi-tiered system to the one in England by the end of the month.

Areas of England in the lowest tier must keep to the nationwide virus rules such as group sizes being capped at six people, and the hospitality industry closing at 22:00. Pubs, restaurants and cafes across Northern Ireland have closedto sit-in customers for the next four weeks. In Wales, a two-week ""fire break"" - a period with tighter restrictions to help break the trajectory of coronavirus cases rising  -is expected within days. Most licensed premises in Scotland's central belt are closed under temporary restrictions, which are expected to be replaced by a similar multi-tiered system to the one in England by the end of the month. Celtic and Rangers football fans are being urgednot to cross the border into England to watch the Old Firm gamein pubs on Saturday. This video can not be played There were scuffles between police and pub goers in Soho ahead of London moving to Tier 2 Greater Manchester's local leaders are resisting a move from tier two to tier three's strict rules on hospitality - pressing instead for more shielding measures for the vulnerable, extra financial aid and stricter local powers to shut down venues breaking virus guidelines. ""We firmly believe that protecting health is about more than controlling the virus and requires proper support for people whose lives would be severely affected by a tier three lockdown,"" the deputy mayors and council leaders said in a joint statement. ""We can assure the prime minister that we are ready to meet at any time to try to agree a way forward."" Mr Johnson warned on Friday that the situation in Manchester was worsening and thathe may intervene if the new measures cannot be agreedwith the region's leaders. But Kate Green, Labour MP for Stretford and Urmston said there had been no talks between the government and Greater Manchester's leaders on Friday because ""No 10 did not pick up the phone"" - with no further meetings expected until Monday. Rochdale council leader Allen Brett told BBC Newsnight: ""I stood by all day waiting for a meeting which never took place."" PM warns he may 'need to intervene' on Manchester 'Not knowing is killing the business' Local leaders in north-east England said they were committed to ""ongoing, constructive dialogue"" with central government. In a joint statement, council leaders in Northumberland, Newcastle, South and North Tyneside, Gateshead, Sunderland and County Durham urged residents to ""do their bit"" to avoid being put under tier three restrictions. Divisions over circuit-breaker Meanwhile, calls for a circuit-breaker - a short but strict national lockdown - have been supported by Labour as well as some Conservative MPs. Kate Green told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""The Labour leaders in Greater Manchester support the call for a national circuit-break because what we're seeing in Manchester today - the rest of the country is coming along behind. The rate is rising everywhere."" Ms Green, who is also shadow education secretary, added that extra restrictions would not be effective without a package of support to ""enable people to close their businesses [and] to isolate at home if they need to"". Conservative MP and former health secretary Jeremy Hunt called for an end to the ""public war of words"" between local and national leaders on Saturday, but added he had ""sympathy"" for the idea of a circuit-breaker. Britain's largest teachers' union, the National Education Union, has called for secondary schools in England to shut for two weeks at half term, rather than the traditional one week. Mr Johnson has said that while he could not ""rule anything out"", he wants to avoid a national lockdown because of ""the damaging health, economic and social effects it would have"". This video can not be played ""Time is of the essence"" for Manchester - Boris Johnson It comes as the hospitality industry warned of widespread job losses if businesses do not receive further financial support from the government. Some 750,000 hospitality jobs could be lost by February 2021, according to an industry survey by three trade bodies in the UK. ""Without urgent sector-specific support for our industry, massive business failure is imminent,"" a spokesman for UK Hospitality, the British Institute of Innkeeping and the British Beer & Pub Association said. Public Health England's medical director Yvonne Doyle told the Today programme that officials from local and national public health services were working ""extremely hard... to try and ensure that we do the right thing at the right time with the maximum amount of agreement"". She also urged the public to abide by the rules and ""understand why that's important"". Meanwhile, county councils in England are calling for the government to give local authorities more control over the test-and-trace system. The County Councils Network, which represents local authorities in mainly rural parts of the country, hopes to avoid the prospect of greater restrictions in these areas. The PM said on Friday that the UK was developing the capacity to manufacture millions of tests that could deliver results in just 15 minutes. THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? SOCIAL LIFE:Is it safe to go to the pub? The new tests are ""faster, simpler and cheaper"", Mr Johnson said, adding that work is being carried out to ensure they can be manufactured and distributed in the UK. The government has set a target of 500,000 tests a day by the end of the month. Oxford University's Sir John Bell, who has advised the government on its testing programme, told the Today programme it could be ""possible"" for the UK to carry out a million tests a day by Christmas - but added that logistics such as getting swabs to testing centres quickly were ""the limiting factor"".

"Helen Pye said there had been shift toward staycations, resulting in more visitors to Snowdonia Wales' tourism sector faces ""very dark days"", with firms closing and hotels ""mothballed"" amid the coronavirus pandemic, an industry body has said. Wales Tourism Alliance (WTA) said a Covid resurgence meant hopes of making up for several ""lost months"" had faded. But some in the sector said it could be a chance to attract new visitors and improve sustainability. The Welsh Government said a Â£1.7bn support package had helped and it was committed to delivering sustainability. ""If things pick up and businesses do make it through, then I think we're very well-placed to pick up customers that would normally have gone overseas,"" said Adrian Greason-Walker of the WTA, which represents thousands of firms. ""However, we've probably had five weeks of trade this year instead of what would normally be 20 solid weeks over the summer. ""At the moment things are dark."" Ban to begin on visiting Wales from Covid hotspots Worry over 'holiday in Wales' advice to tourists Wales Covid travel ban plan 'risks division' It comes after the Welsh Government announced aban on visitors travelling from coronavirus hotspots elsewhere in the UK, which came into effect on Friday. That followed mounting tension overfears from some residents around an ""influx"" of touriststo areas not currently subject to lockdown restrictions in Wales, such as Ceredigion, most of Carmarthenshire, Powys, Pembrokeshire and Gwynedd. A two-week ""fire break"" - a period with tighter restrictions to help break the trajectory of coronavirus cases rising in Wales - is alsoexpected within days. Can I travel to Wales? Mr Greason-Walker said about half of tourism businesses surveyed by the WTA feared they might not survive the next six months, with some facing the ""worst possible scenario"". ""If we can pick up any silver lining from this awful situation then it's that we can still offer people some respite from it all. ""I think we've seen a return to family holidays to Wales, whereas before they might have caught a flight to Spain and spent a week on a beach over there. ""We've got a fantastic landscape and environment here. We're going to have to come out of this crisis at some point."" One area significantly bucking the trend for reduced footfall was Snowdonia, with figures from Visit Wales suggesting more people intended to visit the national park than anywhere else in Wales over the next few months. Wish you were here? Visit Wales said Snowdon was top of most people's to-do list in Wales ""I would say it's been the busiest summer that we have ever seen,"" said Helen Pye, the park's engagement officer. ""August was incredibly busy - and September the figures were up by about 40 to 50% compared to a normal year."" However, having large numbers of visitors concentrated in certain areas has heightened fears about over-tourism. ""The tourism industry is incredibly important to us, but we've been seeing a huge increase in the challenges we already had,"" said Ms Pye. ""There's been an increase in traffic, pollution and noise in the national park. We've also seen huge amounts of litter in the area and anti-social behaviour and fly camping."" However, she and others in the industry hope Wales can follow the lead of countries such as New Zealand and Iceland in introducing a sustainable tourism model - which would aim to spread visitors more evenly by promoting less well-known places. Louise Dixey would like to see a change to the way Wales is seen and treated as a destination ""Sustainable tourism is about reducing the negative impacts of tourism and maximising the benefits,"" explained Louise Dixey, from Cardiff Metropolitan University's Next Tourism Generation project. ""It's not about the number of visitors, but it's about how much they spend and whether their visit can benefit local communities. ""There needs to be an emphasis on almost de-marketing some of these hotspots like Snowdonia and marketing unheard of places in Wales to try and spread the visitor load and make it more manageable."" A winter break centred around long walks and dining out can be seen as bringing in far more benefit for less impact than a daytrip to the beach in the height of summer, for example, where the only expenses may be car parking and an ice cream. 'Sustainable tourism' call prompted by influx Lockdown tourism fear over Elvis Festival visitors Mess left at beauty spots 'unacceptable' However, for some, the strategy still would not go far enough. Howard Huws, from Welsh language group, Cylch yr Iaith, said some Welsh-speaking communities had been feeling ""overwhelmed"" by the tourist trade for decades. ""We're constantly being told that the only way to deal with tourism is to bolster it further - but we are in a situation where it's already wreaking damage,"" said Mr Huws. ""People find themselves with few job opportunities - and any opportunities in tourism are seasonal and low paid. ""The cost of having those jobs is people then find themselves priced out of the housing market. We find ourselves unable to access the sites within our own landscape where tourism has taken control. ""They are talking about diversifying it and spreading it - but not about controlling it. Without controlling it - nothing is sustainable."" Wales' travel ban bars visitors from Northern Ireland, England's tier two and three areas and the Scottish central belt Across the industry there is an acknowledgement coronavirus may have created a strange paradox, simultaneously crippling businesses while potentially increasing their future demand - as people switch from foreign holidays to staycations. ""There is a slight concern given the current situation that many tourism and hospitality businesses might not survive until spring 2021,"" said Ms Dixey. ""But there has been a surge in domestic demand. So we might actually be in a situation next year where market demand exceeds supply, particularly in relation to accommodation, which would limit the number of visitors."" The Welsh Government said its Â£1.7bn support package was the ""most generous"" in the UK and included a Â£500m economic resilience fund which had ""helped protect the livelihoods of more than 100,000 people"". A spokesman added: ""Over the course of the pandemic and in the coming years we will continue to listen closely to the people of Wales, the industry and visitors to ensure what we're delivering is sustainable and provides prosperity for everyone.""

The coverage has been brought to you by Sarah Collerton, George Bowden, Thomas Mackintosh, Joshua Cheetham and Paul Gribben.  There have been a further 16,171 coronavirus across the UK,the government's latest daily figures show,external. This brings the total number of positive Covid-19 infections to 705,428. A further 150 people have died within 28 days of a positive test - taking the total number of UK deaths to 43,579. Accountancy firm Deloitte has announced it is set to close four of its UK offices. Deloitte UK managing partner Stephen Griggs said: ""Covid-19 has fast-tracked our future of work programme, leading us to review our real estate portfolio and how we use our offices across the UK, including London."" The offices being closed are at Gatwick, Liverpool, Nottingham and Southampton. Mr Griggs said the firm is consulting with around 500 employees who work at those offices about the proposals. ""Everyone based in these locations will continue to be employed by
Deloitte and any proposed change is to our 'bricks and mortar', not our
presence in these regions,"" he said. ""We remain committed to these regional markets and will continue our close
relationships with our clients, society partners and communities, just without
a physical building."" In May, Deloitte scrapped its summer internship scheme forstudents in order to cut costs during the coronavirus crisis. Cinemas have started reopening in India after being closed for seven months due to the coronavirus pandemic. But watching a movie in a cinema won't be the same now - at least in the foreseeable future. There will be no eager crowds or long queues at the ticket counter as social distancing is enforced. Names and phone numbers will be collected at the entrance for contact tracing, and seating in cinema will be capped at 50% of the regular capacity. Even popcorn will be sterilised under UV rays for eight minutes,external, reported local media. But the biggest blow may well be the lack of new material - for months, cinemas watched helplessly from the sidelines as streaming platforms snapped up Bollywood movies that were willing to opt for an online release. This leaves cinemas with no option but to re-release older titles, including those from 2018. Read more about cinemas in India reopening here. Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent The Department of Health says an issue has been resolved with the NHS Covid-19 app, following complaints that it had failed to update when new local alert levels were introduced. Some users in London said the app didn't change its display after the level rose from medium to high. The BBC has
discovered the reason the app's risk level has been
updating at different times on users' handsets is down to cost. While in theory it
would be possible to configure enough remote computer servers to update
everyoneâs app simultaneously, this would be much more expensive than
staggering the risk level change transmissions. Those involved
believe that by spacing out the updates, they are offering better value to the
taxpayer. About
18 million people have now installed the app, according to a source, and the
more that do so the more need there is to avoid overwhelming the back-end
infrastructure, they explained. Iran's health ministry has reported that 253 coronavirus patients have died over the last 24 hours, bringing the national death toll to 30,123. Case numbers have also risen by 4,103 to 526,490, a ministry spokesperson told state TV channel IRINN. Iran's total number of deaths is the highest in the Middle East, and the 10th highest in the world, according to Johns Hopkins University data. Shortly after the latest figures were announced, Iranian authorities said they would be extending closures and restrictions in Tehran and four other cities for another week to help curb infections. Scottish Premiership side St Mirren have been forced to call off this afternoon's game with Motherwell after another member of their team tested positive
for Covid-19. Two players had already contracted the virus earlier this weekwith a third
forced into self-isolation. NowSt Mirren have postponed their showdown with Motherwellat the Simple
Digital Arena after the latest test result meant a number of other squad members
would have to go into self-isolation. Chief executive Tony Fitzpatrick added: ""It is very disappointing that
we are faced with this situation despite the numerous precautions and safeguards
that are in place within the club.""  A further 86 people who tested positive for coronavirus have died in hospital in England, new NHS data has shown. It brings the total number of confirmed deaths reported in English hospitals to 30,910. The NHS said the latest patients were aged between 44 and 99 and that all but two patients, aged 62 and 79, had known underlying health conditions. The deaths were between 16 September and 16 October. The
number of deaths of patients with Covid-19 by region are as follows: Belgium's Foreign Minister Sophie WilmÃ¨s has announced she has tested positive for coronavirus - saying she potentially contracted it from a family member. In a series of tweets, Ms WilmÃ¨s said that rising cases in the country were a reminder ""that no one is safe"". ""Take care of yourself and especially for each other,"" she added. It comes days after Ms WilmÃ¨s attended face-to-face talks with several other EU foreign ministers in Luxembourg. Since the 12 October meeting, Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg has also tested positive. As cases rise in Kansas City, in the US state of Missouri, many hospitals in and around the city are so full they are having to turn away ambulances and refuse non-emergency care,ABC News reports,external. Marc Larsen, an operations director at Saint Luke's hospital - the region's second largest care provider - told the American broadcaster that many hospitals are ""bursting at the seams"". ""The current trajectory and the rapid increase in infections is a big concern for me,"" said Mr Larsen. ""With our numbers where they are coming into influenza season, I worry that the facilities will continue to be pushed to the brink."" Missouri is one of several states in the midwestern US which is grappling with a surge in coronavirus cases. More than 11,200 have beenreported,externalover the last seven days, bringing the state's total number of cases to nearly 155,000. Scotland has recorded 15 deaths ofcoronavirus patients in the past 24 hours, the latest official figures show. This takes the death toll under this measure - of people who first tested positive for the virus within the previous 28 days - to 2,609. A total of 1,167 people have tested positive for the virus in the past 24 hours, bringing the total since the start of the pandemic to 46,399. There are 675 people in hospital confirmed to have the virus as of yesterday, up by 46 in 24 hours and of these patients, 62 were in intensive care, up by four. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent When two sides cannot even agree on the arrangement of a phone call, it doesn't bode well for the bigger picture. After 48 hours of stand-off between Downing Street and the mayor of Greater Manchester, it seemed there might be some progress. Downing Street claimed they had ""reached out"" and a call had been arranged between Andy Burnham and No 10 for Sunday morning. But soon after that Mr Burnham's spokesperson said nothing had been agreed. This may seem like a tedious running commentary on the logistics of negotiations, and on one level it is. But as coronavirus cases continue to rise there is a lot riding on these discussions, or lack of. People in Greater Manchester may be wondering how long it will be before action of some sort is taken, and what restrictions they'll be asked to endure when it is. People in Greater Manchester are facing confusion over Covid-19 rules, as local leaders denied Downing Street's claim that talks have been arranged to resolve a row over tougher restrictions. No 10 told the BBC it had arranged a call with the region's mayor, Andy Burnham, on Sunday morning. However, Mr Burnham's office said ""nothing has yet been arranged"". It comes after UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he may intervene to place Greater Manchester into tier three - very high - in England's new system of rules - something Mr Burnham has been resisting. He is instead pressing for more shielding measures for the vulnerable, extra financial aid and stricter local powers to shut down venues breaking virus guidelines. Read morehere. The Vatican has said that a man living in the same residence as Pope Francis has tested positive for coronavirus and is now in isolation. The man has not been named, and did not not show any symptoms of the illness before testing,according to a statement.,externalAn undisclosed number of people who came into contact with him have also been isolated. The Pope is regularly tested for Covid-19, and is continuing with his regular schedule, Reuters reports. It's not the first time this has happened. Back in March, someone else living in the residence - which has about 130 rooms and suites - contracted coronavirus during the height of Italy's outbreak.  There have been a further674 cases of Covid-19 recorded in Wales, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in the country to 34,679. Public Health Wales said five further deaths had been reported, with the total number of deaths since the beginning of the pandemic rising to 1,708.

A spokesperson told the BBC they had ""reached out"" to Mr Burnham on Saturday morning. The development comes after the prime minister yesterday said he would intervene and impose restrictions in the region if agreement couldn't be reached with local leaders. The mayor's office has been approached for comment but did not immediately respond. Read the latesthere. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent At least 48 hours have passed since there
was any discussion between the government and leaders in Greater Manchester. It's not complete radio silence - I
understand conversations have continued between officials inWhitehall and the region's local authorities. But there won't be a breakthrough until
politicians on one side pick up the phone. Both camps have indicated they're ready to
talk, but neither seems willing to make the first move. The prime minister did not put a time
limit onhis pledge to impose restrictionsif no agreement can be reached, but
he will only be able to wait so long. One thing everyone involved agrees on is
that something needs to be done as coronavirus casescontinue to rise,external. Given the political fault lines this row
has exposed - Conservative vs Labour, north vs south, local vs national - deciding
exactly what is proving far more difficult. The chief of Greater Manchester Police has defended its role in enforcing coronavirus regulations after a report suggested officers were caught in the middle of a political fight over tougher rules. Discussions between the government and local leaders overputting the region into the highest levelof restrictions are at a stalemate. A Daily Telegraph article said Boris Johnson has held back on new restrictions in Greater Manchester amid fears over enforcement of the rules because the police answer to Mayor Andy Burnham. But Ian Hopkins, Greater Manchester Police chief constable, said in a statement that it was for politicians to decide regulations andhis officers would enforce them proportionately,external. Ch Con Hopkins said the force's approach has been supported by both Greater Manchester's mayor and Home Secretary Priti Patel, and he has been in regular contact with them throughout the pandemic. Meanwhile, businesses in Greater Manchestersay they are frustratedby the uncertainty over whether the area will be moved into the highest level of restrictions. Â© 2025 BBC.

It's repeated at 23:25 on BBC One Scotland. FT: Celtic 0-2 Rangers A reminder that Rangers got the day rolling with a win in the game of the day, beating reigning champions Celtic 2-0 on their own patch to open up a four-point gap at the top. Celtic have a game in hand, but manager Neil Lennon was most unhappy with a leak of his starting XI before kick-off. This video can not be played Celtic team leak 'disgusting', says Lennon FT: Dundee United 0-0 Aberdeen Aberdeen manager Derek McInnesrefuses to blame a contentious penalty decision for his side's inability to break down a stubborn Dundee United - admitting the visitors should have worked the goalkeeper more. âWe should be turning that performance into three points"", he tells BBC Sportsound. ""Performance was good, motivation was good, there's not a lot I could be critical about. But, with the number of shots and set-plays we had, we should be working the keeper a lot more."" However, McInnes thought that it looked like United striker Lawrence Shankland has stopped a goal-bound effort with his hand. St Mirren P-P Motherwell Hamilton drop to the bottom on goal difference behind a St Mirren side who had their game at home to Motherwell postponed just over an hour before kick-off. The Paisley club have been the worst-hit outfit and a third positive Covid-19 test left the club with eight available outfield players. St Mirren told the SPFL, which has launched an investigation, they could not fulfil the fixture after ""a number of additional players"" were required to self-isolate. They and Accies have now played the same number of games and Hamilton boss Brian Rice insists he is not panicking about the position they find themselves in. FT: Livingston 1-3 Kilmarnock Livingston head coach Gary Holt felt his side deserved something from their 3-1 defeat by Kilmarnock. ""We started well, we played really well throughout the game, but goals cost you,"" he tells BBC Scotland. ""The third is a sickener because we were in the ascendancy. The second one [penalty] is debatable. ""Effort, desire, putting your body in, getting the ball up the park and creating chances - I can't fault them. But we have to be more professional when we've got the lead."" A mistake from Robby McCrorie (grounded) gifted Kilmarnock a third goal FT: Livingston 1-3 Kilmarnock Kilmarnock manager Alex Dyercouldn't hide his pride as his players returned from self isolation - and the loss of an early goal - to beat Livingston. ""Overwhelmed, ecstatic,"" Dyer tells BBC Scotland. ""They did everything we asked. They've only had a few days of training and they've come back and put in a performance like that. ""They did the job well today and I'm very proud."" Kilmarnock manager Alex Dyer (right) is delighted with his side's win FT: Hamilton 3-5 St Johnstone St Johnstone manager Callum Davidson enjoyed watching his team score five goals, adding to seven in midweek League Cup action, after four league games without one - and lift themselves off the foot of the Premiership. ""It was one of those heart-attack games,"" he tells Sportsound. ""I thought we started really well and it was great to get the first goal, we managed to score three. But, all credit to Hamilton, they kept fighting, they've got that spirit about them, they never get up. ""Having to score five goals to win a game makes a change from the start of the season when we couldn't score. I'm delighted for the attacking players. They got their reward today."" Stevie May (left) has scored five goals in two games FT: Hamilton 3-5 St Johnstone Hamilton head coach Brian Rice took heart that this side threatened to come back from 3-0 down after being on the wrong end of an eight-goal thriller against St Johnstone that leaves them bottom of the Premiership table. ""The priority is to win the game and get points on the board,"" he tells BBC Scotland. ""We went for it. We were 3-0 down before we knew it, but at least we had a go. ""At half-time, we thought we could get something out of it, we thought the next goal was important. But we needed to hold on for five minutes and give ourselves a chance to get the equaliser."" FT: Dundee United 0-0 Aberdeen Dundee United manager Micky Mellon was happy to accept a point after being dominated by visitors Aberdeen. ""It was a tough game, which we expected,"" he tells BBC Scotland. ""We know we are coming into a league after being in the Championship for four years and against teams like Aberdeen we've got to show the qualities we showed today. ""The resilience, the battling, defending your 18-yard box and try to be good on the turnovers or set-plays to get something out of it ""We want to get better with the football, but in terms of the qualities needed, it was a good points and clean sheet and I couldn't fault the players."" Micky Mellon was thankful to goalkeeper Benjamin Siegrist With Celtic having lost at home, Hibs and Aberdeen had the chance to significantly narrow the gap between themselves and the side sitting second in the Premiership table. But both stuttered to a draw despite dominating their respective games. Aberdeen in particular had almost compete control against Dundee United but are six points behind Celtic, although they do have a game in hand. Hibs are two points better off but have played two more games than the Dons and one more than the reigning champions. Hibs striker Christian Doidge lamented a late chance FT: Celtic 0-2 Rangers We heard earlier from a triumphant Rangers manager, Steven Gerrard, who confessed to being ""shocked"" by centre-back Connor Goldson's double. ""But he's certainly capable,"" Gerrard told Sky Sports. ""Heâs starting to attack set-pieces
now and is hungry to score. âHis all-round performance was outstanding. Connor deserves the
headlines he's going to get. He led us from the back and you could hear his
voice throughout the game."" On the significance of Rangers' victory, Gerrard adds: ""It could be different
because the last time we won here it was then the winter break and that ruined
our rhythm and fluidity. âIt was a really
mature, experienced performance today, but we need more of that for the rest of
the season. That is our biggest challenge - can we go the distance?"" FT: Celtic 0-2 Rangers It seems like an age ago that Rangers stretched their lead at the top of the table with a 2-0 win away to reigning champions Celtic and one wonders if Neil Lennon's has calmed down yet. Even before the news that Kieran Tierney was allowed out of self-isolation to play for Arsenal while Ryan Christie was not, the Celtic manager was seething about his starting line-up being leaked online last night ""Itâs not great,"" he told Sportsound. ""Somebody within the club is doing us in,
basically, and thatâs disgusting. Weâll try to get to the bottom of it."" Asked if it made his job more difficult, he added: ""Of
course it does. I keep talking about a sense of
privacy around our club and it doesnât seem to be the case with some people.""

Ross County, having played the last 10 minutes plus stoppage time with 10 men, hold on for a point. Martin Boyle, Christian Doidge, Kevin Nisbet and Paul Hanlon all had chances to give the visitors all three points, but a combination of poor finishing and Ross Doohan leave them heading back to Easter Road frustrated. Aberdeen miss the chance to overtake Hibs after they were unable to break down a stubborn Dundee United. The away side were
aggrieved to see a penalty appeal waved away when the ball appeared to strike
Lawrence Shankland's arm on the goal line. Goalkeeper Benjamin
Siegrist put in a strong performance, keeping the dominant visitors frustrated. United were unable to
threaten much, but the points were shared. Ross County 0-0 Hibernian Another chance for Hibs! Paul Hanlon heads an effort straight at Ross Doohan and then nods his follow-up wide. How haven't Hibs scored?! Kilmarnock shrug off their recent Covid-19 troubles - and the loss of an early goal - to beat Livingston. Alex Dyer's side were back at full strength after almost an entire first-team squad were forced to self-isolate. Scott Pittman gave Livingston an early lead, but Aaron Tshibola and a Chris Burke penalty turned the tables. And a horror mistake from home goalkeeper Robbie McCrorie allowed Greg Kiltie to add a third. The sides were level on points before the game, but Kilmarnock now move up to fifth, while Livingston drop to eighth. Chris Burke, Aaron Tshibola and Greg Kiltie were all on the scoresheet for Kilmarnock Livingston 1-3 Kilmarnock More frustration for Livingston in the dying moments of this game as Jay Emmanuel-Thomas hits the ball off the crossbar. Ross County 0-0 Hibernian What a chance for Christian Doidge to win it for Hibs. He has a free header from a free-kick and he puts it over. Is that their last chance? What a thriller of a game, but it is St Johnstone who take the points against a Hamilton side who never seem to accept defeat. As it is, the Perth side take advantage of a quickfire treble at the start of the game. Â© 2025 BBC.

The coverage has been brought to you by Sarah Collerton, George Bowden, Thomas Mackintosh, Joshua Cheetham and Paul Gribben.  There have been a further 16,171 coronavirus across the UK,the government's latest daily figures show,external. This brings the total number of positive Covid-19 infections to 705,428. A further 150 people have died within 28 days of a positive test - taking the total number of UK deaths to 43,579. Accountancy firm Deloitte has announced it is set to close four of its UK offices. Deloitte UK managing partner Stephen Griggs said: ""Covid-19 has fast-tracked our future of work programme, leading us to review our real estate portfolio and how we use our offices across the UK, including London."" The offices being closed are at Gatwick, Liverpool, Nottingham and Southampton. Mr Griggs said the firm is consulting with around 500 employees who work at those offices about the proposals. ""Everyone based in these locations will continue to be employed by
Deloitte and any proposed change is to our 'bricks and mortar', not our
presence in these regions,"" he said. ""We remain committed to these regional markets and will continue our close
relationships with our clients, society partners and communities, just without
a physical building."" In May, Deloitte scrapped its summer internship scheme forstudents in order to cut costs during the coronavirus crisis. Cinemas have started reopening in India after being closed for seven months due to the coronavirus pandemic. But watching a movie in a cinema won't be the same now - at least in the foreseeable future. There will be no eager crowds or long queues at the ticket counter as social distancing is enforced. Names and phone numbers will be collected at the entrance for contact tracing, and seating in cinema will be capped at 50% of the regular capacity. Even popcorn will be sterilised under UV rays for eight minutes,external, reported local media. But the biggest blow may well be the lack of new material - for months, cinemas watched helplessly from the sidelines as streaming platforms snapped up Bollywood movies that were willing to opt for an online release. This leaves cinemas with no option but to re-release older titles, including those from 2018. Read more about cinemas in India reopening here. Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent The Department of Health says an issue has been resolved with the NHS Covid-19 app, following complaints that it had failed to update when new local alert levels were introduced. Some users in London said the app didn't change its display after the level rose from medium to high. The BBC has
discovered the reason the app's risk level has been
updating at different times on users' handsets is down to cost. While in theory it
would be possible to configure enough remote computer servers to update
everyoneâs app simultaneously, this would be much more expensive than
staggering the risk level change transmissions. Those involved
believe that by spacing out the updates, they are offering better value to the
taxpayer. About
18 million people have now installed the app, according to a source, and the
more that do so the more need there is to avoid overwhelming the back-end
infrastructure, they explained. Iran's health ministry has reported that 253 coronavirus patients have died over the last 24 hours, bringing the national death toll to 30,123. Case numbers have also risen by 4,103 to 526,490, a ministry spokesperson told state TV channel IRINN. Iran's total number of deaths is the highest in the Middle East, and the 10th highest in the world, according to Johns Hopkins University data. Shortly after the latest figures were announced, Iranian authorities said they would be extending closures and restrictions in Tehran and four other cities for another week to help curb infections. Scottish Premiership side St Mirren have been forced to call off this afternoon's game with Motherwell after another member of their team tested positive
for Covid-19. Two players had already contracted the virus earlier this weekwith a third
forced into self-isolation. NowSt Mirren have postponed their showdown with Motherwellat the Simple
Digital Arena after the latest test result meant a number of other squad members
would have to go into self-isolation. Chief executive Tony Fitzpatrick added: ""It is very disappointing that
we are faced with this situation despite the numerous precautions and safeguards
that are in place within the club.""  A further 86 people who tested positive for coronavirus have died in hospital in England, new NHS data has shown. It brings the total number of confirmed deaths reported in English hospitals to 30,910. The NHS said the latest patients were aged between 44 and 99 and that all but two patients, aged 62 and 79, had known underlying health conditions. The deaths were between 16 September and 16 October. The
number of deaths of patients with Covid-19 by region are as follows: Belgium's Foreign Minister Sophie WilmÃ¨s has announced she has tested positive for coronavirus - saying she potentially contracted it from a family member. In a series of tweets, Ms WilmÃ¨s said that rising cases in the country were a reminder ""that no one is safe"". ""Take care of yourself and especially for each other,"" she added. It comes days after Ms WilmÃ¨s attended face-to-face talks with several other EU foreign ministers in Luxembourg. Since the 12 October meeting, Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg has also tested positive. As cases rise in Kansas City, in the US state of Missouri, many hospitals in and around the city are so full they are having to turn away ambulances and refuse non-emergency care,ABC News reports,external. Marc Larsen, an operations director at Saint Luke's hospital - the region's second largest care provider - told the American broadcaster that many hospitals are ""bursting at the seams"". ""The current trajectory and the rapid increase in infections is a big concern for me,"" said Mr Larsen. ""With our numbers where they are coming into influenza season, I worry that the facilities will continue to be pushed to the brink."" Missouri is one of several states in the midwestern US which is grappling with a surge in coronavirus cases. More than 11,200 have beenreported,externalover the last seven days, bringing the state's total number of cases to nearly 155,000. Scotland has recorded 15 deaths ofcoronavirus patients in the past 24 hours, the latest official figures show. This takes the death toll under this measure - of people who first tested positive for the virus within the previous 28 days - to 2,609. A total of 1,167 people have tested positive for the virus in the past 24 hours, bringing the total since the start of the pandemic to 46,399. There are 675 people in hospital confirmed to have the virus as of yesterday, up by 46 in 24 hours and of these patients, 62 were in intensive care, up by four. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent When two sides cannot even agree on the arrangement of a phone call, it doesn't bode well for the bigger picture. After 48 hours of stand-off between Downing Street and the mayor of Greater Manchester, it seemed there might be some progress. Downing Street claimed they had ""reached out"" and a call had been arranged between Andy Burnham and No 10 for Sunday morning. But soon after that Mr Burnham's spokesperson said nothing had been agreed. This may seem like a tedious running commentary on the logistics of negotiations, and on one level it is. But as coronavirus cases continue to rise there is a lot riding on these discussions, or lack of. People in Greater Manchester may be wondering how long it will be before action of some sort is taken, and what restrictions they'll be asked to endure when it is. People in Greater Manchester are facing confusion over Covid-19 rules, as local leaders denied Downing Street's claim that talks have been arranged to resolve a row over tougher restrictions. No 10 told the BBC it had arranged a call with the region's mayor, Andy Burnham, on Sunday morning. However, Mr Burnham's office said ""nothing has yet been arranged"". It comes after UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he may intervene to place Greater Manchester into tier three - very high - in England's new system of rules - something Mr Burnham has been resisting. He is instead pressing for more shielding measures for the vulnerable, extra financial aid and stricter local powers to shut down venues breaking virus guidelines. Read morehere. The Vatican has said that a man living in the same residence as Pope Francis has tested positive for coronavirus and is now in isolation. The man has not been named, and did not not show any symptoms of the illness before testing,according to a statement.,externalAn undisclosed number of people who came into contact with him have also been isolated. The Pope is regularly tested for Covid-19, and is continuing with his regular schedule, Reuters reports. It's not the first time this has happened. Back in March, someone else living in the residence - which has about 130 rooms and suites - contracted coronavirus during the height of Italy's outbreak.  There have been a further674 cases of Covid-19 recorded in Wales, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in the country to 34,679.

was any discussion between the government and leaders in Greater Manchester. It's not complete radio silence - I
understand conversations have continued between officials inWhitehall and the region's local authorities. But there won't be a breakthrough until
politicians on one side pick up the phone. Both camps have indicated they're ready to
talk, but neither seems willing to make the first move. The prime minister did not put a time
limit onhis pledge to impose restrictionsif no agreement can be reached, but
he will only be able to wait so long. One thing everyone involved agrees on is
that something needs to be done as coronavirus casescontinue to rise,external. Given the political fault lines this row
has exposed - Conservative vs Labour, north vs south, local vs national - deciding
exactly what is proving far more difficult. The chief of Greater Manchester Police has defended its role in enforcing coronavirus regulations after a report suggested officers were caught in the middle of a political fight over tougher rules. Discussions between the government and local leaders overputting the region into the highest levelof restrictions are at a stalemate. A Daily Telegraph article said Boris Johnson has held back on new restrictions in Greater Manchester amid fears over enforcement of the rules because the police answer to Mayor Andy Burnham. But Ian Hopkins, Greater Manchester Police chief constable, said in a statement that it was for politicians to decide regulations andhis officers would enforce them proportionately,external. Ch Con Hopkins said the force's approach has been supported by both Greater Manchester's mayor and Home Secretary Priti Patel, and he has been in regular contact with them throughout the pandemic. Meanwhile, businesses in Greater Manchestersay they are frustratedby the uncertainty over whether the area will be moved into the highest level of restrictions. Â© 2025 BBC.

"People in Greater Manchester are facing confusion over possible changes to Covid-19 rules, as local leaders denied Downing Street's claim that talks have been arranged to resolve a row. No 10 told the BBC it had arranged a call with the region's mayor, Andy Burnham, on Sunday morning. But Mr Burnham's office said no such call had been scheduled. Tighter rules kicked in for millions of people in Englandon Saturday as areas moved up a tier in a new alert system. BBC political correspondent Jonathan Blake said the conflicting information could be as a result of negotiating tactics. The Department for Health and Social Care confirmed 16,171 more people had tested positive for coronavirus in the UK as of Saturday and a further 150 people had died within 28 days of a positive test - taking the total to 43,579. Prime MinisterBoris Johnson said on Friday that infection rates in Greater Manchester were ""grave""and added: ""Each day that passes before action is taken means more people will go to hospital, more people will end up in intensive care and tragically more people will die."" Mr Burnham and other local leaders have so far resisted a move from tier two to tier three's strict rules on hospitality - pressing instead for more shielding measures for the vulnerable, extra financial aid and stricter local powers to shut down venues breaking virus guidelines. ""We firmly believe that protecting health is about more than controlling the virus and requires proper support for people whose lives would be severely affected by a tier three lockdown,"" the deputy mayors and council leaders said in a joint statement. When two sides cannot even agree on the arrangement of a phone call, it doesn't bode well for the bigger picture. After 48 hours of stand-off between Downing Street and the mayor of Greater Manchester, it seemed there might be some progress. Downing Street claimed they had ""reached out"" and a call had been arranged between Andy Burnham and No 10 for Sunday morning. But soon after that Mr Burnham's spokesperson said nothing had been agreed. These moves could be seen as negotiating tactics, the result of a breakdown in communication or a lack of trust between the two sides. They may also seem like a tedious running commentary on the logistics of negotiations, and on one level it is. But as coronavirus cases continue to rise there is a lot riding on these discussions, or lack thereof. People in Greater Manchester may be wondering how long it will be before action of some sort is taken, and what restrictions they'll be asked to endure when it is. More than half of England - in excess of 28 million people - is now under extra coronavirus restrictions, under the new three-tier alert system. How worried should we be? Make yourself a cuppa and get up to date with the rules Can I stay with my partner in Tier 2? And other questions 'I don't expect to see any friends until 2021' Lancashire has joined the Liverpool City Region in the top tier - tier three. Pubs have closed and households cannot mix indoors or in many outdoor settings. London, Essex, York, Elmbridge, Barrow-in-Furness, North East Derbyshire, Erewash and Chesterfield have moved into tier two, meaning they can no longer mix inside with those from other households, including in pubs and restaurants. Areas of England in the lowest tier must keep to the nationwide virus rules such as group sizes being capped at six people, and the hospitality industry closing at 22:00. Meanwhile, calls for a circuit-breaker - a short but strict national lockdown - have been supported by Labour as well as some Conservative MPs. Kate Green, Labour MP for Stretford and Urmston, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""The Labour leaders in Greater Manchester support the call for a national circuit-break because what we're seeing in Manchester today - the rest of the country is coming along behind. The rate is rising everywhere."" Ms Green, who is also shadow education secretary, added that extra restrictions would not be effective without a package of support to ""enable people to close their businesses [and] to isolate at home if they need to"". Conservative MP and former health secretary Jeremy Hunt called for an end to the ""public war of words"" between local and national leaders on Saturday, but added he had ""sympathy"" for the idea of a circuit-breaker. Britain's largest teachers' union, the National Education Union, has called for secondary schools in England to shut for two weeks at half term, rather than the traditional one week. Mr Johnson has said that while he could not ""rule anything out"", he wants to avoid a national lockdown because of ""the damaging health, economic and social effects it would have"".

Pubs, restaurants and cafes across Northern Ireland have closedto sit-in customers for the next four weeks whilein Wales, talks continueover a potential two-week ""fire break"" - a period with tighter restrictions to help slow the spread. Most licensed premises in Scotland's central belt are closed under temporary restrictions, which are expected to be replaced by a similar multi-tiered system to the one in England by the end of the month.

"Helen Pye said there had been shift toward staycations, resulting in more visitors to Snowdonia Wales' tourism sector faces ""very dark days"", with firms closing and hotels ""mothballed"" amid the coronavirus pandemic, an industry body has said. Wales Tourism Alliance (WTA) said a Covid resurgence meant hopes of making up for several ""lost months"" had faded. But some in the sector said it could be a chance to attract new visitors and improve sustainability. The Welsh Government said a Â£1.7bn support package had helped and it was committed to delivering sustainability. ""If things pick up and businesses do make it through, then I think we're very well-placed to pick up customers that would normally have gone overseas,"" said Adrian Greason-Walker of the WTA, which represents thousands of firms. ""However, we've probably had five weeks of trade this year instead of what would normally be 20 solid weeks over the summer. ""At the moment things are dark."" Ban to begin on visiting Wales from Covid hotspots Worry over 'holiday in Wales' advice to tourists Wales Covid travel ban plan 'risks division' It comes after the Welsh Government announced aban on visitors travelling from coronavirus hotspots elsewhere in the UK, which came into effect on Friday. That followed mounting tension overfears from some residents around an ""influx"" of touriststo areas not currently subject to lockdown restrictions in Wales, such as Ceredigion, most of Carmarthenshire, Powys, Pembrokeshire and Gwynedd. A two-week ""fire break"" - a period with tighter restrictions to help break the trajectory of coronavirus cases rising in Wales - is alsoexpected within days. Can I travel to Wales? Mr Greason-Walker said about half of tourism businesses surveyed by the WTA feared they might not survive the next six months, with some facing the ""worst possible scenario"". ""If we can pick up any silver lining from this awful situation then it's that we can still offer people some respite from it all. ""I think we've seen a return to family holidays to Wales, whereas before they might have caught a flight to Spain and spent a week on a beach over there. ""We've got a fantastic landscape and environment here. We're going to have to come out of this crisis at some point."" One area significantly bucking the trend for reduced footfall was Snowdonia, with figures from Visit Wales suggesting more people intended to visit the national park than anywhere else in Wales over the next few months. Wish you were here? Visit Wales said Snowdon was top of most people's to-do list in Wales ""I would say it's been the busiest summer that we have ever seen,"" said Helen Pye, the park's engagement officer. ""August was incredibly busy - and September the figures were up by about 40 to 50% compared to a normal year."" However, having large numbers of visitors concentrated in certain areas has heightened fears about over-tourism. ""The tourism industry is incredibly important to us, but we've been seeing a huge increase in the challenges we already had,"" said Ms Pye. ""There's been an increase in traffic, pollution and noise in the national park. We've also seen huge amounts of litter in the area and anti-social behaviour and fly camping."" However, she and others in the industry hope Wales can follow the lead of countries such as New Zealand and Iceland in introducing a sustainable tourism model - which would aim to spread visitors more evenly by promoting less well-known places. Louise Dixey would like to see a change to the way Wales is seen and treated as a destination ""Sustainable tourism is about reducing the negative impacts of tourism and maximising the benefits,"" explained Louise Dixey, from Cardiff Metropolitan University's Next Tourism Generation project. ""It's not about the number of visitors, but it's about how much they spend and whether their visit can benefit local communities. ""There needs to be an emphasis on almost de-marketing some of these hotspots like Snowdonia and marketing unheard of places in Wales to try and spread the visitor load and make it more manageable."" A winter break centred around long walks and dining out can be seen as bringing in far more benefit for less impact than a daytrip to the beach in the height of summer, for example, where the only expenses may be car parking and an ice cream. 'Sustainable tourism' call prompted by influx Lockdown tourism fear over Elvis Festival visitors Mess left at beauty spots 'unacceptable' However, for some, the strategy still would not go far enough. Howard Huws, from Welsh language group, Cylch yr Iaith, said some Welsh-speaking communities had been feeling ""overwhelmed"" by the tourist trade for decades. ""We're constantly being told that the only way to deal with tourism is to bolster it further - but we are in a situation where it's already wreaking damage,"" said Mr Huws. ""People find themselves with few job opportunities - and any opportunities in tourism are seasonal and low paid. ""The cost of having those jobs is people then find themselves priced out of the housing market. We find ourselves unable to access the sites within our own landscape where tourism has taken control. ""They are talking about diversifying it and spreading it - but not about controlling it. Without controlling it - nothing is sustainable."" Wales' travel ban bars visitors from Northern Ireland, England's tier two and three areas and the Scottish central belt Across the industry there is an acknowledgement coronavirus may have created a strange paradox, simultaneously crippling businesses while potentially increasing their future demand - as people switch from foreign holidays to staycations. ""There is a slight concern given the current situation that many tourism and hospitality businesses might not survive until spring 2021,"" said Ms Dixey. ""But there has been a surge in domestic demand. So we might actually be in a situation next year where market demand exceeds supply, particularly in relation to accommodation, which would limit the number of visitors."" The Welsh Government said its Â£1.7bn support package was the ""most generous"" in the UK and included a Â£500m economic resilience fund which had ""helped protect the livelihoods of more than 100,000 people"". A spokesman added: ""Over the course of the pandemic and in the coming years we will continue to listen closely to the people of Wales, the industry and visitors to ensure what we're delivering is sustainable and provides prosperity for everyone.""

"Some pubs and bars would be forced to shut if Greater Manchester goes into tier 3 restrictions Businesses in Greater Manchester say they are frustrated by the uncertainty over whether the area will be moved into tier three Covid-19 restrictions. Talks over putting the region in the strictest levelhave stalled since Thursday but are expected to resume. One business owner said ""hats off"" to local leaders for fighting but that ""not knowing is killing the business"". The prime minister said on Fridaythat the situation in the region, currently in tier two, was worsening. Talks had stalled as regional leaders called for more support measures if the area was to be placed under tier three rules. They have been pressing for more shielding measures for the vulnerable, extra financial aid and stricter local powers to shut down venues breaking guidelines. Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham said the move to the ""very high"" alert level - which includes some pub closures and bans on household mixing indoors, in private gardens and most outdoor venues -would amount to a ""punishing lockdown""without ""proper support"". Graffiti appeared on a wall in Piccadilly Gardens in Manchester city centre on Friday Karina Jadhav, owner of Menagerie restaurant in Manchester city centre, said: ""I think it's pretty unanimous in this city, we all feel like Andy Burnham is speaking for us. ""It's easy for somebody who doesn't know what poverty feels like to say there is no financial support there. ""I'm sure Boris Johnson has never had to face it. I have a team here who I will have to face and when they don't have enough hours and can't afford to pay their bills, where do we go from there?"" Sarah Morrison from Little Box Gym in Chorlton, Manchester, said ""fair play"" to Mr Burnham and local leaders who were ""fighting for the best deal for residents and businesses"". ""Hats off to him,"" she said, but added it was ""difficult and stressful"" not knowing what was going to happen. Little Box Gym in Chorlton says bookings are drying up because of the uncertainty ""You're going home and waiting for the news, then going to bed thinking will it affect the next day and it is stressful,"" Ms Morrison said. She said because of the uncertainty, people were cancelling sessions or not booking at all. ""So it is stressful on a personal level but the not knowing is killing the business."" Ms Morrison said if gyms were to close it would be ""unfair"". ""We're trying to keep everyone active. We're not overpopulating the gym, we're cleaning things down, staying 2m apart, ventilating the area. ""For people's mental health as well, if people can't go out and see people they can come to the gym and escape for 45 minutes."" Tim Flynn said his pub in Salford would ""probably last about three months"" Tim Flynn owner of the New Oxford pub on Chapel Street, Salford, said he was pleased to see Mr Burnham ""sticking up for businesses"" but was frustrated not knowing ""if even tomorrow we can open"". The government was treating the North with contempt and ""using us as guinea pigs"", he said, adding: ""If the situation was in London we would be in national lockdown"". He said tier three would be ""absolutely devastating"" for his business which would ""probably last about three months"". Mr Flynn said not knowing what to order while having the threat of further restrictions was ""really annoying"". ""I decided to restock once I heard only Liverpool was in tier three on Monday - I have just taken a delivery. I have been very careful about restocking, never knowing when we might be locked down."" The landlady of the Fishergate said tier three restrictions were ""wishy-washy"" Lorraine, who runs the Fishergate Inn in Wigan, which would be forced to close under tier three rules, said she would ""rather a total shutdown for two weeks than this wishy-washy bit that they're doing"". She thought it was ""unfair"" some pubs would be singled out, adding: ""What difference is the food? Can you have one burger and chips and stay all day drinking?"" She said the pub had restricted numbers, cut hours and introduced table service, all resulting in ""losing more trade"". ""People will just go elsewhere. When they shut pubs in Bolton they just came here. It's just sending it from one area to another."" Eamonn O'Brien, leader of Bury Council, said: ""The problem we have is the approach from the government has far too often been 'take it or leave it'. ""We're told 'sorry there is no money' and I don't accept that argument. ""What we need right now is something quite severe to bring down infections. I don't think tinkering around hospitality is going to make a difference."" A circuit-breaker made more sense, he added. Liberal Democrat opposition leader in Manchester John Leech accused local leaders of being ""completely irresponsible"" by not endorsing tier three restrictions, but also said he supported a circuit-breaker. Nothing eclipsed public health, he said, adding: ""Now is not the time for distractions, legal threats."" However, he said tier three restrictions could be ""too little, too late"". Genting Casinos said there was ""no logic"" shutting casinos Jon Duffy, senior vice president of Genting casinos, said a move to tier three would be ""devastating"", particularly for staff in Bolton where local restrictions had only recently been eased, allowing the casino to reopen on 3 October. ""We haven't had a single reported case of coronavirus,"" he said. ""There's no logic, it's not fixing the problem.""

"People in Greater Manchester are facing confusion over possible changes to Covid-19 rules, as local leaders denied Downing Street's claim that talks have been arranged to resolve a row. No 10 told the BBC it had arranged a call with the region's mayor, Andy Burnham, on Sunday morning. But Mr Burnham's office said no such call had been scheduled. Tighter rules kicked in for millions of people in Englandon Saturday as areas moved up a tier in a new alert system. BBC political correspondent Jonathan Blake said the conflicting information could be as a result of negotiating tactics. The Department for Health and Social Care confirmed 16,171 more people had tested positive for coronavirus in the UK as of Saturday and a further 150 people had died within 28 days of a positive test - taking the total to 43,579. Prime MinisterBoris Johnson said on Friday that infection rates in Greater Manchester were ""grave""and added: ""Each day that passes before action is taken means more people will go to hospital, more people will end up in intensive care and tragically more people will die."" Mr Burnham and other local leaders have so far resisted a move from tier two to tier three's strict rules on hospitality - pressing instead for more shielding measures for the vulnerable, extra financial aid and stricter local powers to shut down venues breaking virus guidelines. ""We firmly believe that protecting health is about more than controlling the virus and requires proper support for people whose lives would be severely affected by a tier three lockdown,"" the deputy mayors and council leaders said in a joint statement. When two sides cannot even agree on the arrangement of a phone call, it doesn't bode well for the bigger picture. After 48 hours of stand-off between Downing Street and the mayor of Greater Manchester, it seemed there might be some progress. Downing Street claimed they had ""reached out"" and a call had been arranged between Andy Burnham and No 10 for Sunday morning. But soon after that Mr Burnham's spokesperson said nothing had been agreed. These moves could be seen as negotiating tactics, the result of a breakdown in communication or a lack of trust between the two sides. They may also seem like a tedious running commentary on the logistics of negotiations, and on one level it is. But as coronavirus cases continue to rise there is a lot riding on these discussions, or lack thereof. People in Greater Manchester may be wondering how long it will be before action of some sort is taken, and what restrictions they'll be asked to endure when it is. More than half of England - in excess of 28 million people - is now under extra coronavirus restrictions, under the new three-tier alert system. How worried should we be? Make yourself a cuppa and get up to date with the rules Can I stay with my partner in Tier 2? And other questions 'I don't expect to see any friends until 2021' Lancashire has joined the Liverpool City Region in the top tier - tier three. Pubs have closed and households cannot mix indoors or in many outdoor settings. London, Essex, York, Elmbridge, Barrow-in-Furness, North East Derbyshire, Erewash and Chesterfield have moved into tier two, meaning they can no longer mix inside with those from other households, including in pubs and restaurants. Areas of England in the lowest tier must keep to the nationwide virus rules such as group sizes being capped at six people, and the hospitality industry closing at 22:00. Meanwhile, calls for a circuit-breaker - a short but strict national lockdown - have been supported by Labour as well as some Conservative MPs. Kate Green, Labour MP for Stretford and Urmston, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""The Labour leaders in Greater Manchester support the call for a national circuit-break because what we're seeing in Manchester today - the rest of the country is coming along behind. The rate is rising everywhere."" Ms Green, who is also shadow education secretary, added that extra restrictions would not be effective without a package of support to ""enable people to close their businesses [and] to isolate at home if they need to"". Conservative MP and former health secretary Jeremy Hunt called for an end to the ""public war of words"" between local and national leaders on Saturday, but added he had ""sympathy"" for the idea of a circuit-breaker. Britain's largest teachers' union, the National Education Union, has called for secondary schools in England to shut for two weeks at half term, rather than the traditional one week. Mr Johnson has said that while he could not ""rule anything out"", he wants to avoid a national lockdown because of ""the damaging health, economic and social effects it would have"". This video can not be played There were scuffles between police and pub goers in Soho ahead of London moving to Tier 2 As coronavirus cases continue to rise rapidly across the UK, the devolved nations are taking their owns steps to curb the spread of infections. Pubs, restaurants and cafes across Northern Ireland have closedto sit-in customers for the next four weeks whilein Wales, talks continueover a potential two-week ""fire break"" - a period with tighter restrictions to help slow the spread. Most licensed premises in Scotland's central belt are closed under temporary restrictions, which are expected to be replaced by a similar multi-tiered system to the one in England by the end of the month.

"Fans were allowed into the Coleraine Ballymena game on Friday night despite the confusion The minister responsible for sport in NI wants all games to happen behind closed doors, even though current regulations say some fans can attend. CarÃ¡l NÃ­ ChuilÃ­n told BBC News NI that fans can ""legally"" go, but appealed to sporting bodies to close their doors. New restrictions aimed at combating the spread of Covid-19 in NI came in on Friday. They are to last four weeks. On Saturday, two further coronavirus-related deaths were reported, bringing the Department of Health total to 610. Another 1,031 people tested positive for Covid-19, 231 people with the virus are in hospital and 27 of them are in intensive care. Northern Ireland schools to close and bars to shut Confusion over fans after Foster tweet At 18:00 BST on Friday,pubs, restaurants and cafes across NI closed their doorsto sit-in customers for the next four weeks. Executive ministers released the full public health guidance relating to the new restrictions on Friday night, but there was someconfusion though over whether spectators could still attend sporting events. A letter issued to sporting bodies by Minister for Communities CarÃ¡l NÃ­ ChuilÃ­n on Friday evening stated that fans were not permitted to attend under the new Covid-19 regulations. However, the First Minister Arlene Foster later said that this was not the case. ""The regulations do not ban fans from stadiums,"" she tweeted. ""The existing position is maintained, permitting a limited number to attend. Preposterous for clubs to be told anything to the contrary."" Allow Twitter content?

The executive announcement came just over an hour before the first match of the new Irish Premiership season. On Saturday morning, the Irish Football Association issued astatement welcoming the fact that fans ""will still be admitted at elite sporting events which are allowed under the regulations"". Later the communities minister, in an interview with BBC News NI, said she had issued her guidance following advice from Northern Ireland's chief medical officer and chief scientific adviser. ""I'm appealing to the sporting bodies to take my advice and to try to play their events behind closed doors because I think we all are trying our best to be safe, to protect lives and to protect each other,"" said Ms NÃ­ ChuilÃ­n. ""I have a duty as minister of sport to ensure that not only are the sporting bodies, the fans, but the general public are protected."" The IFA said that it had worked tirelessly to ensure protocols were in place for the safe return of fans. Gerard Lawlor, chairman of Cliftonville Football, said the future of football was at risk if they could not let fans into games. ""We need financial support from Stormont and if that's coming we can all sit down together and look at the situation,"" he said. ""Today we have asked for an urgent meeting with the executive to plan the way forward."" The minster said she was preparing a bid for ""substantial money to try and help those clubs"", but would bring the issue of supporters at games to her executive colleagues next week. Ms NÃ­ ChuilÃ­n appealed to executive ministers to ""do the right thing"". ""I cannot ignore the medical and scientific advice. It's really important that we collectively as an executive adhere to that advice."" On Friday,Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots said he had ""grave reservations"" about new coronavirus restrictions agreed by the executive. Hospitality businesses will only be allowed to offer takeaway and delivery services for four weeks Most of the measures were announced on Wednesday, but the guidance published on Friday night does provide more clarity on which sectors and services will be affected. As well as the closure of the hospitality sector (apart from deliveries and takeaways), off-licences and supermarkets are not to sell alcohol after 20:00, and fast-food and takeaway premises are to close at 23:00. There was also confirmation that driving instructors must stop offering lessons and as a result, the Department of Infrastructure has also decided to suspend driving tests. The department says the 2,500 customers who have booked a test in the next four weeks will have their appointments cancelled, refunded and rescheduled. However, as driving tests are already booked out until January, some of those affected may not be able to get a slot until February. Other restrictions laid out in the guidance are: No indoor sport or organised contact sport involving mixing of households, other than at elite level No mass events involving more than 15 people (except for allowed outdoor sporting events where the relevant number for that will continue to apply) Close-contact services such as hairdressers and beauticians to close - apart from those relating to the continuation of essential health interventions and therapeutics Mobile hairdressers and make-up artists - also classed as close contact services - prohibited from working in homes Gyms to remain open for individual training but no classes permitted Places of worship to remain open but face coverings mandatory when entering and exiting Wedding ceremonies and civil partnerships to be limited to 25 people with no receptions.  This will be implemented on Monday 19 October Funerals to be limited to 25 people with no pre or post-funeral gatherings Hotels to close, with exemptions for them to offer rooms to essential workers such as workers who need hotels for work-related purposes and ""staff on the front line battling Covid"" A Â£35mscheme designed to help the businesses forced to shutwill open for applications from Monday and will make payments for every fortnight a business is are closed.

"Helen Pye said there had been shift toward staycations, resulting in more visitors to Snowdonia Wales' tourism sector faces ""very dark days"", with firms closing and hotels ""mothballed"" amid the coronavirus pandemic, an industry body has said. Wales Tourism Alliance (WTA) said a Covid resurgence meant hopes of making up for several ""lost months"" had faded. But some in the sector said it could be a chance to attract new visitors and improve sustainability. The Welsh Government said a Â£1.7bn support package had helped and it was committed to delivering sustainability. ""If things pick up and businesses do make it through, then I think we're very well-placed to pick up customers that would normally have gone overseas,"" said Adrian Greason-Walker of the WTA, which represents thousands of firms. ""However, we've probably had five weeks of trade this year instead of what would normally be 20 solid weeks over the summer. ""At the moment things are dark."" Ban to begin on visiting Wales from Covid hotspots Worry over 'holiday in Wales' advice to tourists Wales Covid travel ban plan 'risks division' It comes after the Welsh Government announced aban on visitors travelling from coronavirus hotspots elsewhere in the UK, which came into effect on Friday. That followed mounting tension overfears from some residents around an ""influx"" of touriststo areas not currently subject to lockdown restrictions in Wales, such as Ceredigion, most of Carmarthenshire, Powys, Pembrokeshire and Gwynedd. A two-week ""fire break"" - a period with tighter restrictions to help break the trajectory of coronavirus cases rising in Wales - is alsoexpected within days. Can I travel to Wales? Mr Greason-Walker said about half of tourism businesses surveyed by the WTA feared they might not survive the next six months, with some facing the ""worst possible scenario"". ""If we can pick up any silver lining from this awful situation then it's that we can still offer people some respite from it all. ""I think we've seen a return to family holidays to Wales, whereas before they might have caught a flight to Spain and spent a week on a beach over there. ""We've got a fantastic landscape and environment here. We're going to have to come out of this crisis at some point."" One area significantly bucking the trend for reduced footfall was Snowdonia, with figures from Visit Wales suggesting more people intended to visit the national park than anywhere else in Wales over the next few months. Wish you were here? Visit Wales said Snowdon was top of most people's to-do list in Wales ""I would say it's been the busiest summer that we have ever seen,"" said Helen Pye, the park's engagement officer. ""August was incredibly busy - and September the figures were up by about 40 to 50% compared to a normal year."" However, having large numbers of visitors concentrated in certain areas has heightened fears about over-tourism. ""The tourism industry is incredibly important to us, but we've been seeing a huge increase in the challenges we already had,"" said Ms Pye. ""There's been an increase in traffic, pollution and noise in the national park. We've also seen huge amounts of litter in the area and anti-social behaviour and fly camping."" However, she and others in the industry hope Wales can follow the lead of countries such as New Zealand and Iceland in introducing a sustainable tourism model - which would aim to spread visitors more evenly by promoting less well-known places. Louise Dixey would like to see a change to the way Wales is seen and treated as a destination ""Sustainable tourism is about reducing the negative impacts of tourism and maximising the benefits,"" explained Louise Dixey, from Cardiff Metropolitan University's Next Tourism Generation project. ""It's not about the number of visitors, but it's about how much they spend and whether their visit can benefit local communities. ""There needs to be an emphasis on almost de-marketing some of these hotspots like Snowdonia and marketing unheard of places in Wales to try and spread the visitor load and make it more manageable."" A winter break centred around long walks and dining out can be seen as bringing in far more benefit for less impact than a daytrip to the beach in the height of summer, for example, where the only expenses may be car parking and an ice cream. 'Sustainable tourism' call prompted by influx Lockdown tourism fear over Elvis Festival visitors Mess left at beauty spots 'unacceptable' However, for some, the strategy still would not go far enough. Howard Huws, from Welsh language group, Cylch yr Iaith, said some Welsh-speaking communities had been feeling ""overwhelmed"" by the tourist trade for decades. ""We're constantly being told that the only way to deal with tourism is to bolster it further - but we are in a situation where it's already wreaking damage,"" said Mr Huws. ""People find themselves with few job opportunities - and any opportunities in tourism are seasonal and low paid. ""The cost of having those jobs is people then find themselves priced out of the housing market. We find ourselves unable to access the sites within our own landscape where tourism has taken control. ""They are talking about diversifying it and spreading it - but not about controlling it. Without controlling it - nothing is sustainable."" Wales' travel ban bars visitors from Northern Ireland, England's tier two and three areas and the Scottish central belt Across the industry there is an acknowledgement coronavirus may have created a strange paradox, simultaneously crippling businesses while potentially increasing their future demand - as people switch from foreign holidays to staycations. ""There is a slight concern given the current situation that many tourism and hospitality businesses might not survive until spring 2021,"" said Ms Dixey. ""But there has been a surge in domestic demand. So we might actually be in a situation next year where market demand exceeds supply, particularly in relation to accommodation, which would limit the number of visitors."" The Welsh Government said its Â£1.7bn support package was the ""most generous"" in the UK and included a Â£500m economic resilience fund which had ""helped protect the livelihoods of more than 100,000 people"". A spokesman added: ""Over the course of the pandemic and in the coming years we will continue to listen closely to the people of Wales, the industry and visitors to ensure what we're delivering is sustainable and provides prosperity for everyone.""

"Seventeen areas in Wales currently have local lockdown rules in place ""Clear guidelines"" are needed if a new national lockdown goes ahead in Wales, a council leader has said. Hugh Evans said it was ""important that we keep the public on board"" with any new plans to tackle a rise in Covid-19 cases. The Denbighshire council leader and others held talks with the Welsh Government on Friday ""to consider what is going to happen next week"". Discussions on a""fire-break"" lockdownare continuing over the weekend. Mr Evans toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfasthe wanted the Welsh Government to ""come up with clear guidelines, and a clear understanding, if this does happen"". This video can not be played The BBC's Laura Foster explains what a circuit breaker is and how it could help tackle Covid-19 'Dark days' for tourism but with 'silver linings' Ban on visiting Wales from Covid hotspots begins Mr Evans said he was told on Friday that ""no decision has been made yet"". Denbighshire is one of 17 areas in Wales with local lockdown rules in place to try to reverse anincrease in coronavirus cases. Movement is restricted in and out of these placeswithout a reasonable excuse, such as going to work. On Friday, First Minister Mark Drakeford said a ""short, sharp"" circuit-breaker could slow down the virus. He said a decision was likely to be made on Monday, while talks continued with health officials, scientific advisors and councils over the weekend. ""Doing nothing is not an option,"" he said. People from Covid-19 hotspots in England are banned from visiting Wales, under Welsh Government rules Meanwhile, businesses face an anxious wait to hear if any changes will affect them. Jonathan Greatorex, owner of The Hand hotel at Llanarmon Dyffryn Ceiriog, near Llangollen, Denbighshire, said he had already borrowed money to cover costs, with a wage bill of Â£5,000 a week. ""Coming into winter with fuel bills going up, costs going up, it's completely, completely, worrying for everyone,"" he said. Kathryn Jones, sales and marketing director at food wholesaler Castell Howell in Carmarthenshire, said the firm had faced a ""nightmare"" since the first national lockdown in March and feared ""it's just about to get worse"". ""We have placed orders for produce to come in next week for half term. Are schools involvedâ¦ are we going to end up throwing produce away?"" she said. Nail and beauty salon owner Kelli Gwiliam, from Pencoed, Bridgend, said she felt ""numb"" due to the possible effects on her business from a second lockdown. ""If there is no help, I really do think this is the beginning of the end,"" said the mother-of-four. She said her 11-year-old son told her ""not to worry about Christmas this year"".

"This video can not be played ""I was petrified"" - Det Sgt Nick Bailey on being poisoned by Novichok A police officer who was poisoned in the Salisbury Novichok attack has quit because he ""can no longer do the job"". Det Sgt Nick Bailey was contaminated with the nerve agent at the home of Sergei and Yulia Skripal, the targets of the poisoning operation. After returning to duty last year, he said the aftermath took ""so much from me"" and ""I [have] had to admit defeat"". He worked for the police for 18 years and said he was ""so sad"" after wanting to be an officer since his teens. Angus Macpherson, police and crime commissioner for Wiltshire, where Det Sgt Bailey worked, said throughout his career the officer has symbolised ""dedication and a sense of public duty"". And in a statement, the force said he represents the  ""determination that all of us want to see in police officers across the country"". Allow Twitter content?

Det Sgt Bailey and two Wiltshire Police colleagues were sent to Mr Skripal's home in March 2018, after the former Russian spy and his daughter, who was staying with him, were found seriously ill on a bench in Salisbury. He was contaminated when he touched the door handle of Mr Skripal's home in the city. The Skripals survived the attack after spending several weeks in hospital The Skripals survived the attack, which prompted then Prime Minister Theresa May to tell the House of Commons the operation had ""almost certainly"" been approved by the Russian state. In a series of tweets earlier, Det Sgt Bailey said the impact on him of the attack ""shouldn't be underestimated"". ""I wanted to be a police officer since I was a teenager, I couldn't envisage doing anything else, which is why this makes me so sad,"" he said. ""Like most police officers, I've experienced my fair share of trauma, violence, upset, injury and grief. ""Although I've tried so hard to make it work, I know that I won't find peace whilst remaining in that environment. For me, it's time for a change."" Why Novichok stays deadly for so long Salisbury declared free of Novichok Shock and worry after Novichok case Mr Macpherson thanked Det Sgt Bailey for his ""service and dedication to Wiltshire Police"". ""Nick found himself at the centre of an international, criminal incident which not only affected his health but I am certain changed the course of his family's lives too,"" he said. ""The events in Salisbury and Amesbury back in 2018 remain unprecedented and Nick, himself, has found himself in a situation that no other police officer in this country has been through. ""I know that the force has offered as much welfare support to Nick as possible but I hope today brings Nick and his family some sense of closure and allows them to start to look to the future."" In the months after the attack two Russian nationals were accused of travelling to the UK to try to murder Mr Skripal with novichok. The pair - known by their aliases Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov - were caught on CCTV in Salisbury the day before the attack. The alarm was raised about the Novichok attack when Sergei and Yulia Skripal were found very ill on a bench in the centre of Salisbury Det Sgt Bailey was one of the first to be involved after the alarm about the attack was raised. ""These shocking and unprecedented events changed his life and his family's lives significantly,"" the force said in a statement. ""It is impossible for any of us to fully understand the impact this event has had on Nick and his family, and the sacrifices they made in trying to come to terms with the situation."" ""Day in and day out, officers put themselves directly into harm's way in order to help and protect others,"" the statement continued. ""Nick should be incredibly proud of all that he has achieved and will always be considered to be part of the Wiltshire Police family. ""I am sure that as one chapter closes, another opportunity will open up for Nick.""

"People in Greater Manchester are facing confusion over possible changes to Covid-19 rules, as local leaders denied Downing Street's claim that talks have been arranged to resolve a row. No 10 told the BBC it had arranged a call with the region's mayor, Andy Burnham, on Sunday morning. But Mr Burnham's office said no such call had been scheduled. Tighter rules kicked in for millions of people in Englandon Saturday as areas moved up a tier in a new alert system. BBC political correspondent Jonathan Blake said the conflicting information could be as a result of negotiating tactics. The Department for Health and Social Care confirmed 16,171 more people had tested positive for coronavirus in the UK as of Saturday and a further 150 people had died within 28 days of a positive test - taking the total to 43,579. Prime MinisterBoris Johnson said on Friday that infection rates in Greater Manchester were ""grave""and added: ""Each day that passes before action is taken means more people will go to hospital, more people will end up in intensive care and tragically more people will die."" Mr Burnham and other local leaders have so far resisted a move from tier two to tier three's strict rules on hospitality - pressing instead for more shielding measures for the vulnerable, extra financial aid and stricter local powers to shut down venues breaking virus guidelines. ""We firmly believe that protecting health is about more than controlling the virus and requires proper support for people whose lives would be severely affected by a tier three lockdown,"" the deputy mayors and council leaders said in a joint statement. When two sides cannot even agree on the arrangement of a phone call, it doesn't bode well for the bigger picture. After 48 hours of stand-off between Downing Street and the mayor of Greater Manchester, it seemed there might be some progress. Downing Street claimed they had ""reached out"" and a call had been arranged between Andy Burnham and No 10 for Sunday morning. But soon after that Mr Burnham's spokesperson said nothing had been agreed. These moves could be seen as negotiating tactics, the result of a breakdown in communication or a lack of trust between the two sides. They may also seem like a tedious running commentary on the logistics of negotiations, and on one level it is. But as coronavirus cases continue to rise there is a lot riding on these discussions, or lack thereof. People in Greater Manchester may be wondering how long it will be before action of some sort is taken, and what restrictions they'll be asked to endure when it is. More than half of England - in excess of 28 million people - is now under extra coronavirus restrictions, under the new three-tier alert system. How worried should we be? Make yourself a cuppa and get up to date with the rules Can I stay with my partner in Tier 2? And other questions 'I don't expect to see any friends until 2021' Lancashire has joined the Liverpool City Region in the top tier - tier three. Pubs have closed and households cannot mix indoors or in many outdoor settings. London, Essex, York, Elmbridge, Barrow-in-Furness, North East Derbyshire, Erewash and Chesterfield have moved into tier two, meaning they can no longer mix inside with those from other households, including in pubs and restaurants. Areas of England in the lowest tier must keep to the nationwide virus rules such as group sizes being capped at six people, and the hospitality industry closing at 22:00. Meanwhile, calls for a circuit-breaker - a short but strict national lockdown - have been supported by Labour as well as some Conservative MPs. Kate Green, Labour MP for Stretford and Urmston, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""The Labour leaders in Greater Manchester support the call for a national circuit-break because what we're seeing in Manchester today - the rest of the country is coming along behind. The rate is rising everywhere."" Ms Green, who is also shadow education secretary, added that extra restrictions would not be effective without a package of support to ""enable people to close their businesses [and] to isolate at home if they need to"". Conservative MP and former health secretary Jeremy Hunt called for an end to the ""public war of words"" between local and national leaders on Saturday, but added he had ""sympathy"" for the idea of a circuit-breaker. Britain's largest teachers' union, the National Education Union, has called for secondary schools in England to shut for two weeks at half term, rather than the traditional one week. Mr Johnson has said that while he could not ""rule anything out"", he wants to avoid a national lockdown because of ""the damaging health, economic and social effects it would have"". This video can not be played There were scuffles between police and pub goers in Soho ahead of London moving to Tier 2 As coronavirus cases continue to rise rapidly across the UK, the devolved nations are taking their owns steps to curb the spread of infections. Pubs, restaurants and cafes across Northern Ireland have closedto sit-in customers for the next four weeks whilein Wales, talks continueover a potential two-week ""fire break"" - a period with tighter restrictions to help slow the spread. Most licensed premises in Scotland's central belt are closed under temporary restrictions, which are expected to be replaced by a similar multi-tiered system to the one in England by the end of the month.

It's repeated at 23:25 on BBC One Scotland. FT: Celtic 0-2 Rangers A reminder that Rangers got the day rolling with a win in the game of the day, beating reigning champions Celtic 2-0 on their own patch to open up a four-point gap at the top. Celtic have a game in hand, but manager Neil Lennon was most unhappy with a leak of his starting XI before kick-off. This video can not be played Celtic team leak 'disgusting', says Lennon FT: Dundee United 0-0 Aberdeen Aberdeen manager Derek McInnesrefuses to blame a contentious penalty decision for his side's inability to break down a stubborn Dundee United - admitting the visitors should have worked the goalkeeper more. âWe should be turning that performance into three points"", he tells BBC Sportsound. ""Performance was good, motivation was good, there's not a lot I could be critical about. But, with the number of shots and set-plays we had, we should be working the keeper a lot more."" However, McInnes thought that it looked like United striker Lawrence Shankland has stopped a goal-bound effort with his hand. St Mirren P-P Motherwell Hamilton drop to the bottom on goal difference behind a St Mirren side who had their game at home to Motherwell postponed just over an hour before kick-off. The Paisley club have been the worst-hit outfit and a third positive Covid-19 test left the club with eight available outfield players. St Mirren told the SPFL, which has launched an investigation, they could not fulfil the fixture after ""a number of additional players"" were required to self-isolate. They and Accies have now played the same number of games and Hamilton boss Brian Rice insists he is not panicking about the position they find themselves in. FT: Livingston 1-3 Kilmarnock Livingston head coach Gary Holt felt his side deserved something from their 3-1 defeat by Kilmarnock. ""We started well, we played really well throughout the game, but goals cost you,"" he tells BBC Scotland. ""The third is a sickener because we were in the ascendancy. The second one [penalty] is debatable. ""Effort, desire, putting your body in, getting the ball up the park and creating chances - I can't fault them. But we have to be more professional when we've got the lead."" A mistake from Robby McCrorie (grounded) gifted Kilmarnock a third goal FT: Livingston 1-3 Kilmarnock Kilmarnock manager Alex Dyercouldn't hide his pride as his players returned from self isolation - and the loss of an early goal - to beat Livingston. ""Overwhelmed, ecstatic,"" Dyer tells BBC Scotland. ""They did everything we asked. They've only had a few days of training and they've come back and put in a performance like that. ""They did the job well today and I'm very proud."" Kilmarnock manager Alex Dyer (right) is delighted with his side's win FT: Hamilton 3-5 St Johnstone St Johnstone manager Callum Davidson enjoyed watching his team score five goals, adding to seven in midweek League Cup action, after four league games without one - and lift themselves off the foot of the Premiership. ""It was one of those heart-attack games,"" he tells Sportsound. ""I thought we started really well and it was great to get the first goal, we managed to score three. But, all credit to Hamilton, they kept fighting, they've got that spirit about them, they never get up. ""Having to score five goals to win a game makes a change from the start of the season when we couldn't score. I'm delighted for the attacking players. They got their reward today."" Stevie May (left) has scored five goals in two games FT: Hamilton 3-5 St Johnstone Hamilton head coach Brian Rice took heart that this side threatened to come back from 3-0 down after being on the wrong end of an eight-goal thriller against St Johnstone that leaves them bottom of the Premiership table. ""The priority is to win the game and get points on the board,"" he tells BBC Scotland. ""We went for it. We were 3-0 down before we knew it, but at least we had a go. ""At half-time, we thought we could get something out of it, we thought the next goal was important. But we needed to hold on for five minutes and give ourselves a chance to get the equaliser."" FT: Dundee United 0-0 Aberdeen Dundee United manager Micky Mellon was happy to accept a point after being dominated by visitors Aberdeen. ""It was a tough game, which we expected,"" he tells BBC Scotland. ""We know we are coming into a league after being in the Championship for four years and against teams like Aberdeen we've got to show the qualities we showed today. ""The resilience, the battling, defending your 18-yard box and try to be good on the turnovers or set-plays to get something out of it ""We want to get better with the football, but in terms of the qualities needed, it was a good points and clean sheet and I couldn't fault the players."" Micky Mellon was thankful to goalkeeper Benjamin Siegrist With Celtic having lost at home, Hibs and Aberdeen had the chance to significantly narrow the gap between themselves and the side sitting second in the Premiership table. But both stuttered to a draw despite dominating their respective games. Aberdeen in particular had almost compete control against Dundee United but are six points behind Celtic, although they do have a game in hand. Hibs are two points better off but have played two more games than the Dons and one more than the reigning champions. Hibs striker Christian Doidge lamented a late chance FT: Celtic 0-2 Rangers We heard earlier from a triumphant Rangers manager, Steven Gerrard, who confessed to being ""shocked"" by centre-back Connor Goldson's double. ""But he's certainly capable,"" Gerrard told Sky Sports. ""Heâs starting to attack set-pieces
now and is hungry to score. âHis all-round performance was outstanding. Connor deserves the
headlines he's going to get. He led us from the back and you could hear his
voice throughout the game."" On the significance of Rangers' victory, Gerrard adds: ""It could be different
because the last time we won here it was then the winter break and that ruined
our rhythm and fluidity. âIt was a really
mature, experienced performance today, but we need more of that for the rest of
the season. That is our biggest challenge - can we go the distance?"" FT: Celtic 0-2 Rangers It seems like an age ago that Rangers stretched their lead at the top of the table with a 2-0 win away to reigning champions Celtic and one wonders if Neil Lennon's has calmed down yet. Even before the news that Kieran Tierney was allowed out of self-isolation to play for Arsenal while Ryan Christie was not, the Celtic manager was seething about his starting line-up being leaked online last night ""Itâs not great,"" he told Sportsound. ""Somebody within the club is doing us in,
basically, and thatâs disgusting. Weâll try to get to the bottom of it."" Asked if it made his job more difficult, he added: ""Of
course it does. I keep talking about a sense of
privacy around our club and it doesnât seem to be the case with some people.""

It's repeated at 23:25 on BBC One Scotland. FT: Celtic 0-2 Rangers A reminder that Rangers got the day rolling with a win in the game of the day, beating reigning champions Celtic 2-0 on their own patch to open up a four-point gap at the top. Celtic have a game in hand, but manager Neil Lennon was most unhappy with a leak of his starting XI before kick-off. This video can not be played Celtic team leak 'disgusting', says Lennon FT: Dundee United 0-0 Aberdeen Aberdeen manager Derek McInnesrefuses to blame a contentious penalty decision for his side's inability to break down a stubborn Dundee United - admitting the visitors should have worked the goalkeeper more. âWe should be turning that performance into three points"", he tells BBC Sportsound. ""Performance was good, motivation was good, there's not a lot I could be critical about. But, with the number of shots and set-plays we had, we should be working the keeper a lot more."" However, McInnes thought that it looked like United striker Lawrence Shankland has stopped a goal-bound effort with his hand. St Mirren P-P Motherwell Hamilton drop to the bottom on goal difference behind a St Mirren side who had their game at home to Motherwell postponed just over an hour before kick-off. The Paisley club have been the worst-hit outfit and a third positive Covid-19 test left the club with eight available outfield players. St Mirren told the SPFL, which has launched an investigation, they could not fulfil the fixture after ""a number of additional players"" were required to self-isolate. They and Accies have now played the same number of games and Hamilton boss Brian Rice insists he is not panicking about the position they find themselves in. FT: Livingston 1-3 Kilmarnock Livingston head coach Gary Holt felt his side deserved something from their 3-1 defeat by Kilmarnock. ""We started well, we played really well throughout the game, but goals cost you,"" he tells BBC Scotland. ""The third is a sickener because we were in the ascendancy. The second one [penalty] is debatable. ""Effort, desire, putting your body in, getting the ball up the park and creating chances - I can't fault them. But we have to be more professional when we've got the lead.""

"Football fans have been urged to abide by local lockdown restrictions and watch the Old Firm match at home. The managers of Celtic and Rangers have joined First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in appealing to their supporters to help curb the spread of the virus. Fans who flout rules on households mixing are ""putting others at risk"", one public health chief warned. And those hoping to watch the game in Blackpool pubs were warned there would be a high police presence in the town. Celtic are due to play Rangers at Celtic Park at 12:30. The Scottish Premiership clash will take place in an empty stadium due to coronavirus restrictions which ban crowds from watching live sport. It will be televised but pubs in the central belt are currently closed due to the pandemic. During the Scottish government daily coronavirus briefing on Friday, Ms Sturgeon told Old Firm fans: They should not watch the game in other people's homes They should not travel to other parts of Scotland or to England to watch the game in pubs They should not gather outside the stadium She added: ""Nobody likes the fact that these restrictions have to be in place but they are vital to protecting all of us and keeping us safe. ""So please comply with restrictions - by doing that you will be playing your part in helping us get the virus under control and you'll be helping hasten the day when we can all watch and enjoy the things that we love doing, whether that's football or the many things that we find ourselves not able to do normally.""

"Kristin Scott Thomas, Gareth Malone and Sharon Horgan appeared with the Combined Military Wives Choir at their London UK film premiere in February Venues and organisations including the Military Wives Choirs, The Hepworth Wakefield and Night and Day in Manchester are to receive a share of Â£76m government arts funding. Whitby's Gothic Festival, London's Somerset House and Kneehigh Theatre in Cornwall are also set to benefit. The latest raft of grants, for 588 organisations, will come out of the wider Â£1.57bn Cultural Recovery Fund. It follows Monday's Â£257m injection, which helped The Cavern Club and LSO. Cavern Club and LSO get share of Â£257m culture fund 'The rug can be pulled any time,' say indie stars Emergency money for culture 'won't save every job' Arts industry welcomes Â£1.57bn support package Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said that Saturday's new round of ""vital funding"" would go to ""protect cultural gems across the country, save jobs and prepare the arts to bounce back"". It will cover comedy clubs, circuses, festivals, regional theatres and local museums, across England. ""These awards build on our commitment to be here for culture in every part of the country,"" he added. While July's announcement of the wider support package was welcomed by the arts and entertainment industries, Mr Dowden did admit that it would not be enough to save every job or cultural establishment. The Military Wives Choir rose to fame through the BBC documentary series with Gareth Malone and was recently the subject of a film starring Kristin Scott Thomas and Sharon Horgan. Military Wives: 'Director didn't want us to sound too slick' Director Melanie Nightingale said they were ""incredibly grateful"" for the ""much-needed support,"" at a time when many arts organisations have been struggling due to the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. ""We are thrilled that this funding enables our 73 choirs to sing, share and support one another and feel stronger together through music,"" she said. The grants of under Â£1m have also been awarded to the West End's longest running play, The Mousetrap; the Shangri-La stage at Glastonbury Festival; and grassroots music venues, including Night & Day Cafe. Night & Day Cafe in Manchester has hosted gigs by the likes of the Arctic Monkeys, Elbow, and Jessie J Jennifer Smithson, director of the latter Manchester venue, explained that the financial help ""enables us to plan for the future when we look forward to having live music back at the venue once again"". Joe Wright, who directed films including Pride and Prejudice and Atonement, is also a Kneehigh associate. He said he was delighted the Cornwall theatre had been successful in round two, and will now be able to reopen in December with the aim of providing safe, socially distanced outdoor artistic experiences. ""Kneehigh remain an inspiration for many throughout the sector, they've never got 'stuck' and have always been quick to adapt to new challenges,"" he said. ""Their mission to remain local whilst telling stories that reflect all our lives is vital in helping us all through these unprecedented times."" Further round of funding from the Cultural Recovery Fund pot are expected to be announced in the coming weeks. Organisations that will be receiving funding part of the Â£76m include: Kneehigh Theatre, Cornwall - Â£249,833 Whitby Gothic Festival, North Yorkshire - Â£55,000 Night and Day, Manchester - Â£64,745 Military Wives Choirs, London - Â£92,057 Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival, Yorkshire - Â£50,000 Walk the Plank, Salford - Â£170,268 Solfest, Cumbria - Â£100,000 Circus Berlin, Gateshead - Â£423,000 ZoieLogic Dance Theatre, Southampton - Â£50,544 Create Studios, Swindon - Â£195,222 Somerset House, Westminster, London - Â£850,000 Paraorchestra, Bristol - Â£156,000 The Puppet Theatre Barge, London - Â£52,352 The Hepworth Wakefield Trust, Wakefield, Yorkshire - Â£146,726 Chiltern Open Air Museum, Buckinghamshire - Â£219,008 Hofesh Shechter Company, Brighton - Â£250,000 Britten Sinfonia, Cambridge - Â£197,810 Kings Place, Islington, London - Â£562,000 Berkshire Maestros, Reading - Â£783,746 Vindolanda Trust, Hexham - Â£250,000 Future DJs, Knutsford - Â£175,000 Nottingham Museums - Â£180,000 Moseley Folk and Arts Festival, Birmingham - Â£50,000 The British Motor Museum, Warwick - Â£707,000 Leicester Comedy Festival - Â£105,000 For a full list, visit theArts Council England website.,external Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

"Kristin Scott Thomas, Gareth Malone and Sharon Horgan appeared with the Combined Military Wives Choir at their London UK film premiere in February Venues and organisations including the Military Wives Choirs, The Hepworth Wakefield and Night and Day in Manchester are to receive a share of Â£76m government arts funding. Whitby's Gothic Festival, London's Somerset House and Kneehigh Theatre in Cornwall are also set to benefit. The latest raft of grants, for 588 organisations, will come out of the wider Â£1.57bn Cultural Recovery Fund. It follows Monday's Â£257m injection, which helped The Cavern Club and LSO. Cavern Club and LSO get share of Â£257m culture fund 'The rug can be pulled any time,' say indie stars Emergency money for culture 'won't save every job' Arts industry welcomes Â£1.57bn support package Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said that Saturday's new round of ""vital funding"" would go to ""protect cultural gems across the country, save jobs and prepare the arts to bounce back"". It will cover comedy clubs, circuses, festivals, regional theatres and local museums, across England. ""These awards build on our commitment to be here for culture in every part of the country,"" he added. While July's announcement of the wider support package was welcomed by the arts and entertainment industries, Mr Dowden did admit that it would not be enough to save every job or cultural establishment. The Military Wives Choir rose to fame through the BBC documentary series with Gareth Malone and was recently the subject of a film starring Kristin Scott Thomas and Sharon Horgan. Military Wives: 'Director didn't want us to sound too slick' Director Melanie Nightingale said they were ""incredibly grateful"" for the ""much-needed support,"" at a time when many arts organisations have been struggling due to the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. ""We are thrilled that this funding enables our 73 choirs to sing, share and support one another and feel stronger together through music,"" she said. The grants of under Â£1m have also been awarded to the West End's longest running play, The Mousetrap; the Shangri-La stage at Glastonbury Festival; and grassroots music venues, including Night & Day Cafe. Night & Day Cafe in Manchester has hosted gigs by the likes of the Arctic Monkeys, Elbow, and Jessie J Jennifer Smithson, director of the latter Manchester venue, explained that the financial help ""enables us to plan for the future when we look forward to having live music back at the venue once again"". Joe Wright, who directed films including Pride and Prejudice and Atonement, is also a Kneehigh associate. He said he was delighted the Cornwall theatre had been successful in round two, and will now be able to reopen in December with the aim of providing safe, socially distanced outdoor artistic experiences. ""Kneehigh remain an inspiration for many throughout the sector, they've never got 'stuck' and have always been quick to adapt to new challenges,"" he said. ""Their mission to remain local whilst telling stories that reflect all our lives is vital in helping us all through these unprecedented times."" Further round of funding from the Cultural Recovery Fund pot are expected to be announced in the coming weeks. Organisations that will be receiving funding part of the Â£76m include: Kneehigh Theatre, Cornwall - Â£249,833 Whitby Gothic Festival, North Yorkshire - Â£55,000 Night and Day, Manchester - Â£64,745 Military Wives Choirs, London - Â£92,057 Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival, Yorkshire - Â£50,000 Walk the Plank, Salford - Â£170,268 Solfest, Cumbria - Â£100,000 Circus Berlin, Gateshead - Â£423,000 ZoieLogic Dance Theatre, Southampton - Â£50,544 Create Studios, Swindon - Â£195,222 Somerset House, Westminster, London - Â£850,000 Paraorchestra, Bristol - Â£156,000 The Puppet Theatre Barge, London - Â£52,352 The Hepworth Wakefield Trust, Wakefield, Yorkshire - Â£146,726 Chiltern Open Air Museum, Buckinghamshire - Â£219,008 Hofesh Shechter Company, Brighton - Â£250,000 Britten Sinfonia, Cambridge - Â£197,810 Kings Place, Islington, London - Â£562,000 Berkshire Maestros, Reading - Â£783,746 Vindolanda Trust, Hexham - Â£250,000 Future DJs, Knutsford - Â£175,000 Nottingham Museums - Â£180,000 Moseley Folk and Arts Festival, Birmingham - Â£50,000 The British Motor Museum, Warwick - Â£707,000 Leicester Comedy Festival - Â£105,000 For a full list, visit theArts Council England website.,external Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

"Some pubs and bars would be forced to shut if Greater Manchester goes into tier 3 restrictions Businesses in Greater Manchester say they are frustrated by the uncertainty over whether the area will be moved into tier three Covid-19 restrictions. Talks over putting the region in the strictest levelhave stalled since Thursday but are expected to resume. One business owner said ""hats off"" to local leaders for fighting but that ""not knowing is killing the business"". The prime minister said on Fridaythat the situation in the region, currently in tier two, was worsening. Talks had stalled as regional leaders called for more support measures if the area was to be placed under tier three rules. They have been pressing for more shielding measures for the vulnerable, extra financial aid and stricter local powers to shut down venues breaking guidelines. Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham said the move to the ""very high"" alert level - which includes some pub closures and bans on household mixing indoors, in private gardens and most outdoor venues -would amount to a ""punishing lockdown""without ""proper support"". Graffiti appeared on a wall in Piccadilly Gardens in Manchester city centre on Friday Karina Jadhav, owner of Menagerie restaurant in Manchester city centre, said: ""I think it's pretty unanimous in this city, we all feel like Andy Burnham is speaking for us. ""It's easy for somebody who doesn't know what poverty feels like to say there is no financial support there. ""I'm sure Boris Johnson has never had to face it. I have a team here who I will have to face and when they don't have enough hours and can't afford to pay their bills, where do we go from there?"" Sarah Morrison from Little Box Gym in Chorlton, Manchester, said ""fair play"" to Mr Burnham and local leaders who were ""fighting for the best deal for residents and businesses"". ""Hats off to him,"" she said, but added it was ""difficult and stressful"" not knowing what was going to happen. Little Box Gym in Chorlton says bookings are drying up because of the uncertainty ""You're going home and waiting for the news, then going to bed thinking will it affect the next day and it is stressful,"" Ms Morrison said. She said because of the uncertainty, people were cancelling sessions or not booking at all. ""So it is stressful on a personal level but the not knowing is killing the business."" Ms Morrison said if gyms were to close it would be ""unfair"". ""We're trying to keep everyone active. We're not overpopulating the gym, we're cleaning things down, staying 2m apart, ventilating the area. ""For people's mental health as well, if people can't go out and see people they can come to the gym and escape for 45 minutes."" Tim Flynn said his pub in Salford would ""probably last about three months"" Tim Flynn owner of the New Oxford pub on Chapel Street, Salford, said he was pleased to see Mr Burnham ""sticking up for businesses"" but was frustrated not knowing ""if even tomorrow we can open"". The government was treating the North with contempt and ""using us as guinea pigs"", he said, adding: ""If the situation was in London we would be in national lockdown"". He said tier three would be ""absolutely devastating"" for his business which would ""probably last about three months"". Mr Flynn said not knowing what to order while having the threat of further restrictions was ""really annoying"". ""I decided to restock once I heard only Liverpool was in tier three on Monday - I have just taken a delivery. I have been very careful about restocking, never knowing when we might be locked down."" The landlady of the Fishergate said tier three restrictions were ""wishy-washy"" Lorraine, who runs the Fishergate Inn in Wigan, which would be forced to close under tier three rules, said she would ""rather a total shutdown for two weeks than this wishy-washy bit that they're doing"". She thought it was ""unfair"" some pubs would be singled out, adding: ""What difference is the food? Can you have one burger and chips and stay all day drinking?"" She said the pub had restricted numbers, cut hours and introduced table service, all resulting in ""losing more trade"". ""People will just go elsewhere. When they shut pubs in Bolton they just came here. It's just sending it from one area to another."" Eamonn O'Brien, leader of Bury Council, said: ""The problem we have is the approach from the government has far too often been 'take it or leave it'. ""We're told 'sorry there is no money' and I don't accept that argument. ""What we need right now is something quite severe to bring down infections. I don't think tinkering around hospitality is going to make a difference."" A circuit-breaker made more sense, he added. Liberal Democrat opposition leader in Manchester John Leech accused local leaders of being ""completely irresponsible"" by not endorsing tier three restrictions, but also said he supported a circuit-breaker. Nothing eclipsed public health, he said, adding: ""Now is not the time for distractions, legal threats."" However, he said tier three restrictions could be ""too little, too late"". Genting Casinos said there was ""no logic"" shutting casinos Jon Duffy, senior vice president of Genting casinos, said a move to tier three would be ""devastating"", particularly for staff in Bolton where local restrictions had only recently been eased, allowing the casino to reopen on 3 October. ""We haven't had a single reported case of coronavirus,"" he said. ""There's no logic, it's not fixing the problem.""

It's repeated at 23:25 on BBC One Scotland. FT: Celtic 0-2 Rangers A reminder that Rangers got the day rolling with a win in the game of the day, beating reigning champions Celtic 2-0 on their own patch to open up a four-point gap at the top. Celtic have a game in hand, but manager Neil Lennon was most unhappy with a leak of his starting XI before kick-off. This video can not be played Celtic team leak 'disgusting', says Lennon FT: Dundee United 0-0 Aberdeen Aberdeen manager Derek McInnesrefuses to blame a contentious penalty decision for his side's inability to break down a stubborn Dundee United - admitting the visitors should have worked the goalkeeper more. âWe should be turning that performance into three points"", he tells BBC Sportsound. ""Performance was good, motivation was good, there's not a lot I could be critical about. But, with the number of shots and set-plays we had, we should be working the keeper a lot more."" However, McInnes thought that it looked like United striker Lawrence Shankland has stopped a goal-bound effort with his hand. St Mirren P-P Motherwell Hamilton drop to the bottom on goal difference behind a St Mirren side who had their game at home to Motherwell postponed just over an hour before kick-off. The Paisley club have been the worst-hit outfit and a third positive Covid-19 test left the club with eight available outfield players. St Mirren told the SPFL, which has launched an investigation, they could not fulfil the fixture after ""a number of additional players"" were required to self-isolate. They and Accies have now played the same number of games and Hamilton boss Brian Rice insists he is not panicking about the position they find themselves in. FT: Livingston 1-3 Kilmarnock Livingston head coach Gary Holt felt his side deserved something from their 3-1 defeat by Kilmarnock. ""We started well, we played really well throughout the game, but goals cost you,"" he tells BBC Scotland. ""The third is a sickener because we were in the ascendancy. The second one [penalty] is debatable. ""Effort, desire, putting your body in, getting the ball up the park and creating chances - I can't fault them. But we have to be more professional when we've got the lead."" A mistake from Robby McCrorie (grounded) gifted Kilmarnock a third goal FT: Livingston 1-3 Kilmarnock Kilmarnock manager Alex Dyercouldn't hide his pride as his players returned from self isolation - and the loss of an early goal - to beat Livingston. ""Overwhelmed, ecstatic,"" Dyer tells BBC Scotland. ""They did everything we asked. They've only had a few days of training and they've come back and put in a performance like that. ""They did the job well today and I'm very proud."" Kilmarnock manager Alex Dyer (right) is delighted with his side's win FT: Hamilton 3-5 St Johnstone St Johnstone manager Callum Davidson enjoyed watching his team score five goals, adding to seven in midweek League Cup action, after four league games without one - and lift themselves off the foot of the Premiership. ""It was one of those heart-attack games,"" he tells Sportsound. ""I thought we started really well and it was great to get the first goal, we managed to score three. But, all credit to Hamilton, they kept fighting, they've got that spirit about them, they never get up. ""Having to score five goals to win a game makes a change from the start of the season when we couldn't score. I'm delighted for the attacking players. They got their reward today."" Stevie May (left) has scored five goals in two games FT: Hamilton 3-5 St Johnstone Hamilton head coach Brian Rice took heart that this side threatened to come back from 3-0 down after being on the wrong end of an eight-goal thriller against St Johnstone that leaves them bottom of the Premiership table. ""The priority is to win the game and get points on the board,"" he tells BBC Scotland. ""We went for it. We were 3-0 down before we knew it, but at least we had a go. ""At half-time, we thought we could get something out of it, we thought the next goal was important. But we needed to hold on for five minutes and give ourselves a chance to get the equaliser."" FT: Dundee United 0-0 Aberdeen Dundee United manager Micky Mellon was happy to accept a point after being dominated by visitors Aberdeen. ""It was a tough game, which we expected,"" he tells BBC Scotland. ""We know we are coming into a league after being in the Championship for four years and against teams like Aberdeen we've got to show the qualities we showed today. ""The resilience, the battling, defending your 18-yard box and try to be good on the turnovers or set-plays to get something out of it ""We want to get better with the football, but in terms of the qualities needed, it was a good points and clean sheet and I couldn't fault the players."" Micky Mellon was thankful to goalkeeper Benjamin Siegrist With Celtic having lost at home, Hibs and Aberdeen had the chance to significantly narrow the gap between themselves and the side sitting second in the Premiership table. But both stuttered to a draw despite dominating their respective games. Aberdeen in particular had almost compete control against Dundee United but are six points behind Celtic, although they do have a game in hand. Hibs are two points better off but have played two more games than the Dons and one more than the reigning champions. Hibs striker Christian Doidge lamented a late chance FT: Celtic 0-2 Rangers We heard earlier from a triumphant Rangers manager, Steven Gerrard, who confessed to being ""shocked"" by centre-back Connor Goldson's double. ""But he's certainly capable,"" Gerrard told Sky Sports. ""Heâs starting to attack set-pieces
now and is hungry to score. âHis all-round performance was outstanding. Connor deserves the
headlines he's going to get. He led us from the back and you could hear his
voice throughout the game."" On the significance of Rangers' victory, Gerrard adds: ""It could be different
because the last time we won here it was then the winter break and that ruined
our rhythm and fluidity. âIt was a really
mature, experienced performance today, but we need more of that for the rest of
the season. That is our biggest challenge - can we go the distance?"" FT: Celtic 0-2 Rangers It seems like an age ago that Rangers stretched their lead at the top of the table with a 2-0 win away to reigning champions Celtic and one wonders if Neil Lennon's has calmed down yet. Even before the news that Kieran Tierney was allowed out of self-isolation to play for Arsenal while Ryan Christie was not, the Celtic manager was seething about his starting line-up being leaked online last night ""Itâs not great,"" he told Sportsound. ""Somebody within the club is doing us in,
basically, and thatâs disgusting. Weâll try to get to the bottom of it."" Asked if it made his job more difficult, he added: ""Of
course it does. I keep talking about a sense of
privacy around our club and it doesnât seem to be the case with some people."" Championship, League One and League Two Scottish Championship Ayr United 2-1 Queen of the South Dunfermline Athletic 3-1 Inverness Caledonian Thistle Greenock Morton 1-0 Alloa Athletic Raith Rovers 3-0 Arbroath Scottish League One Airdrieonians 2-0 Peterhead Clyde 1-0 Partick Thistle Cove Rangers 3-1 East Fife Forfar Athletic 0-0 Dumbarton Montrose 1-3 Falkirk Scottish League Two Albion Rovers 1-3 Stenhousemuir Brechin City 1-5 Edinburgh City Cowdenbeath 0-3 Annan Athletic Stirling Albion 0-0 Queen's Park Stranraer 1-4 Elgin City How have Hibs not won that? Ross County, having played the last 10 minutes plus stoppage time with 10 men, hold on for a point. Martin Boyle, Christian Doidge, Kevin Nisbet and Paul Hanlon all had chances to give the visitors all three points, but a combination of poor finishing and Ross Doohan leave them heading back to Easter Road frustrated. Aberdeen miss the chance to overtake Hibs after they were unable to break down a stubborn Dundee United. The away side were
aggrieved to see a penalty appeal waved away when the ball appeared to strike
Lawrence Shankland's arm on the goal line. Goalkeeper Benjamin
Siegrist put in a strong performance, keeping the dominant visitors frustrated. United were unable to
threaten much, but the points were shared. Ross County 0-0 Hibernian Another chance for Hibs! Paul Hanlon heads an effort straight at Ross Doohan and then nods his follow-up wide. How haven't Hibs scored?! Kilmarnock shrug off their recent Covid-19 troubles - and the loss of an early goal - to beat Livingston. Alex Dyer's side were back at full strength after almost an entire first-team squad were forced to self-isolate. Scott Pittman gave Livingston an early lead, but Aaron Tshibola and a Chris Burke penalty turned the tables. And a horror mistake from home goalkeeper Robbie McCrorie allowed Greg Kiltie to add a third. The sides were level on points before the game, but Kilmarnock now move up to fifth, while Livingston drop to eighth. Chris Burke, Aaron Tshibola and Greg Kiltie were all on the scoresheet for Kilmarnock Livingston 1-3 Kilmarnock More frustration for Livingston in the dying moments of this game as Jay Emmanuel-Thomas hits the ball off the crossbar. Ross County 0-0 Hibernian What a chance for Christian Doidge to win it for Hibs. He has a free header from a free-kick and he puts it over. Is that their last chance? What a thriller of a game, but it is St Johnstone who take the points against a Hamilton side who never seem to accept defeat. As it is, the Perth side take advantage of a quickfire treble at the start of the game. Â© 2025 BBC.

"For many dog owners, the coronavirus pandemic has meant more time at home with their canine companions. However, some experts are claiming the demand for dogs during lockdown has led to a significant increase in pets being stolen, with one - Wayne May from the organisation Dog Lost - saying: ""I've been doing this for 30 years now and it's the worst ever year I've known"". ""Unfortunately, due to lockdown, people are at home more and they're looking for companion animals to take up their time. ""Sadly the criminals capitalised on this. It's pushed the price of dogs and puppies up in general, which has inadvertently sparked a high rise in dog thefts."" His view is shared by Beverley Cuddy, editor of Dogs Today magazine, who said: ""Unfortunately in lockdown everyone wanted a dog and the prices went up and up. ""The criminals looked at those figures... and put two and two together."" In July, Jessica Palmer had five puppies stolen from her back garden in Melton Mowbray. The sprocker spaniels were from a litter of seven that Ms Palmer's springer spaniel had given birth to eight weeks earlier. She said she was ""devastated"" and her three-year-old daughter was ""absolutely heartbroken"". Ms Palmer had listed the puppies for sale at Â£1,000 each. ""I know they were going to go to new homes eventually anyway, but not like this. It's really traumatic for everyone,"" she said. In May, Jon Gaunt had three female springer spaniels stolen from his garden in Brightling, East Sussex. He said thieves broke the padlock on his kennels to take them. ""It wasn't until the next morning, when I went to exercise the dogs, clean them out and give them their breakfast, I saw the chain hanging down and I just had that horrible feeling,"" he said. Mr Gaunt, 46, said he felt ""angry, gutted, upset and sick"". ""You have such a rollercoaster of emotions - you feel like somebody has just taken your legs out from underneath you,"" he said. One of his spaniels was found several weeks later in Kent. Mr Gaunt also suspects a dog recovered during a police raid could be one of his and he's working with authorities to get her back. He believes ""without a shadow of a doubt"" there is a connection with dog thefts and the pandemic lockdown. ""Everybody was at home, they were bored, and thought, 'Lets get a puppy'. ""The demand for puppies was so high, it drove prices through the roof and that's why we're in this situation,"" he said. More than 30 puppies, thought to have been stolen, were found in a van by police in Cheltenham in August The Kennel Club reported a 168% increase inpeople searching for puppies for sale,externalon its website from the beginning of lockdown until the end of May, compared to the same period in 2019. Mr May said most of the dogs being stolen are female and are used for breeding, so criminal gangs can maximise their profits. ""We've recovered several this year that have been pregnant,"" he said. This theory was also shared by Suffolk Police in July, when17 dogs were stolen from a kennelsin Barton Mills. Mr May said the theft of a dog can have a ""massive"" impact on owners, and some were now suffering from depression, anxiety and PTSD. ""I [was in touch with] one lady recently that just never went to bed. She slept on the sofa with the back door open all summer, hoping her dog would walk home,"" he said. Criminals are thought to be targeting puppy litters Dr Daniel Allen, an animal expert from Keele University, is campaigning for stricter sentencing guidelines for pet theft,via a petition which is due to be debated by MPs at Westminster Hall on Monday. He said the crime had changed dramatically over the decades. ""Years ago, it was people nicking dogs from outside shops,"" he said. ""Now it's people targeting breeders, taking the mum and the pups in one fell swoop."" He said breeders were generally more rural-based, hence the rise recorded in police force areas such as Northumbria and Devon and Cornwall. ""As well as breeding mums, working dogs, such as sheep dogs and shooting dogs also attract a high value - they are a ready-made, sellable product,"" he said. ""During lockdown, people wanted that canine companionship but there is an increasing risk of our pets being taken away from us."" The results of a BBC freedom of information request showed that five policing areas saw a double-digit increase in the number of dog thefts reported between January and July 2020, compared with the previous year. Overall, about half of the 26 forces that responded to the BBC's data request saw an increase over the last seven months, while the rest saw fewer reports. Five forces had more reports between January and July 2020 than the whole of the previous year. There was a significant increase across Northumbria, Devon and Cornwall and Leicestershire - compared to the same period in the previous year. Northumbria Police saw the largest increase of reported dog thefts, rising from 27 to 67 reports. In Leicestershire, there were 41 reports compared to 22, which was also more than the total for the whole of 2016, 2017 and 2018. The RSPCA said the figures were ""really concerning"". A spokesperson said: ""We'd urge all dog owners to take extra precautions to protect their pets from thieves by neutering them, ensuring they are microchipped and ensuring they wear a collar with contact details."" Police forces in the affected areas also urged owners to take extra precautions. ""Dog owners are also advised not to leave their pets alone outside where possible and to ensure gardens are secure,"" a Leicestershire Police spokesperson said. A Northumbria Police spokesperson said the chances of pet owners being targeted remains ""incredibly rare"". A Devon and Cornwall Police spokesperson said: ""We take all matters of animal theft seriously and we appreciate the distress and heartache that dog thefts cause.""

"This video can not be played The PM says it is time to ""get readyâ for trading arrangements with the EU to be ""more like Australia's"" from 1 January. Talks between the UK and EU over a post-Brexit trade agreement are ""over"", Downing Street has said. No 10 argued there was ""no point"" in discussions continuing next week unless the EU was prepared to discuss the detailed legal text of a partnership. UK chief negotiator Lord Frost said he had told EU counterpart Michel Barnier there was now no ""basis"" for planned talks on Monday. Number 10 said the two sides had agreed to talk again next week - by phone. Earlier, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen tweeted that the Brussels negotiating team would go to London after the weekend to ""intensify"" discussions. France's Europe minister ClÃ©ment Beaune told BBC Newsnight that, while the EU would not pursue a deal at any cost, ""we will listen to what the UK side wants to say to us"".

In the morning, Boris Johnson said the country had to ""get ready"" to trade next year without an agreement, although he did not say the talks were over. He suggested the EU was unwilling to consider seriously the UK's preferred option of a comprehensive free trade agreement based on the bloc's existing arrangement with Canada. The UK, he added, must look at the ""alternative"" - which he suggested was Australia's much-more limited set of agreements with the EU. ""The talks are over."" As statements go, those four words from the prime minister's spokesman this afternoon were something of a bombshell. But Michel Barnier, due to come to London next week to continue talks, might not be unpacking his briefcase just yet. There's no doubt that Downing Street is sending the clearest signal possible that it expects the EU to make the next move. And the rhetoric accompanying the talks has reached a new level. But both sides still want a deal, the process has not broken down and there is still time to reach an agreement. It's one thing to declare the talks over; it's another thing to refuse to continue talking. The prime minister's official spokesman took a tougher line with Brussels later in the day. ""There is only any point in Michel Barnier coming to London next week if he's prepared to address all the issues on the basis of a legal text in an accelerated way, without the UK required to make all the moves or to discuss the practicalities of travel and haulage,"" he said. ""If not, there is no point in coming."" What is a 'Canada-style' trade deal? Brexit: What is the 'no-deal' Australia option? He added: ""Trade talks are over. The EU have effectively ended them by saying they do not want to change their negotiating position."" The UK and EU had been hoping for a ""zero-tariff"" agreement to govern their trading relationship once the UK's post-Brexit transition period ends on 31 December. If no deal is reached, they will operate on World Trade Organization rules, meaning tariffs are imposed. Mrs von der Leyen (R) left the summit early after exchanging views with EU leaders By BBC Brussels correspondent Nick Beake Boris Johnson's public declaration that the UK should prepare for no deal did not cause great concern within EU circles. The immediate response came in a tweet from Commission President Ursula von der Leyen who said it was full steam ahead for trade talks next week and that EU negotiators would be getting on the Eurostar to London as planned. But the subsequent statement from the prime minister's official spokesman that the ""trade talks are over"" has left senior diplomats ""deeply unimpressed"", as one put it. Although ""we're getting used to being part of Johnson's pantomime"", they added. Some EU figures fear Boris Johnson still doesn't know if he actually wants a deal and is trying to buy time while he grapples with the Covid crisis. Following the hardening of the British position by No 10, France's President Macron called on the prime minister to make up his mind, while there was still time. Many in Brussels remain ""cautiously optimistic"" some sort of deal can be agreed, but any route there is now even harder to see. After the EU summit concluded on Friday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said it would be best to get a deal and that compromises on both sides would be needed. French President Emmanuel Macron said the UK needed a Brexit deal more than the EU did. For Labour, shadow Cabinet Office minister Rachel Reeves urged the UK government to ""step back from the brink"" and ""stop posturing"". ""Any tariffs or any delays at the border will make it harder for goods to flow freely, whether those are foods or medicines,"" she said.

"Football fans have been urged to abide by local lockdown restrictions and watch the Old Firm match at home. The managers of Celtic and Rangers have joined First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in appealing to their supporters to help curb the spread of the virus. Fans who flout rules on households mixing are ""putting others at risk"", one public health chief warned. And those hoping to watch the game in Blackpool pubs were warned there would be a high police presence in the town. Celtic are due to play Rangers at Celtic Park at 12:30. The Scottish Premiership clash will take place in an empty stadium due to coronavirus restrictions which ban crowds from watching live sport. It will be televised but pubs in the central belt are currently closed due to the pandemic. During the Scottish government daily coronavirus briefing on Friday, Ms Sturgeon told Old Firm fans: They should not watch the game in other people's homes They should not travel to other parts of Scotland or to England to watch the game in pubs They should not gather outside the stadium She added: ""Nobody likes the fact that these restrictions have to be in place but they are vital to protecting all of us and keeping us safe. ""So please comply with restrictions - by doing that you will be playing your part in helping us get the virus under control and you'll be helping hasten the day when we can all watch and enjoy the things that we love doing, whether that's football or the many things that we find ourselves not able to do normally.""

Temporary restrictions to bring the outbreak back under control in the central belt have led to the closure of most licensed premises in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, Lothian, Forth Valley and Ayrshire and Arran NHS boards.

He added: ""We will have a very visible policing presence throughout the weekend and we'll be working with our partners and council wardens to ensure that licensed premises are sticking to the rules. ""The rules are there to keep everyone, both residents and visitors, safe and we will enforce them where we need to.""

""Hopefully we can put in a performance that you can be proud of and enjoy the game, but please, don't travel."" Steven Gerrard said he could understand the frustration of those who wanted to see their team play, but said fans' safety was priority. He urged them to stay at home to keep themselves and their families safe. Public health officials from NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde have also asked fans to abide by the restrictions. Dr Linda De Caestecker said fans who broke the guidelines were ""putting others at risk"". She said: ""The current restrictions are in place to minimise the spread of the virus.

"Millions of us are facing fresh curbs on our freedoms this weekend, after a busy week of developments in the fight against Covid. So what's happening and how do the changes affect you? Early on the stars of virus vocab included Covidiots, superspreaders, and Zoom-bombing. As ""circuit-breaker"" and ""tier three"" grapple for position on the newest page of the already-oversized Covid phrasebook, here's an attempt to make things a little simpler for you. All four UK nations have responded to a surge in coronavirus cases by tightening up restrictions. InEngland, the government's brought in a new system of rules, as it presses on with its local approach to tackling outbreaks. Every area has been given a Covid alert level - with a corresponding tier - based on the risk the virus poses. Tier one is for medium risk areas, tier two for high risk and tier three for very high risk. The rules you must follow depend upon which tier you live in. Since the system came into effect on Wednesday, several areas have moved up a tier - with Lancashire the latest to hit ""very high risk"" status. It's still unclear whether Greater Manchester will follow. Local leaders in very high risk areas can add their own extra restrictions, so keep an eye on what your local authority is saying to make sure you're sticking to all the rules. In the next couple of weeks,Scotlandis planning to adopt a similar, multi-tiered system to England.Northern Irelandhas entered a so-called ""circuit-breaker"" (see below for an attempted definition) with a blanket closure of pubs, restaurants and cafes to sit-in customers. Schools will be shut for at least two weeks by lengthening the half-term holiday.Walescould face similar measures as soon as Monday, as officials use the weekend to mull over a ""fire-break"" period. Can I stay at my partner's in a Tier 2 area? And other questions How will the tier system work? Between me writing this piece on Friday evening and you reading it over breakfast on Saturday, rules will have tightened for millions of people across the country. As things change rapidly, your best bet for staying up to date with the rules where you live is to use our postcode look-up tool: A modern browser with JavaScript and a stable internet connection is required to view this interactive.

And don't forget the basic methods of keeping yourself and others safe from the virus: wash your hands often, wear a face covering incertain public places, and socially distance. An electrical circuit-breaker is an automatic switch which detects faults and stops power flowing through a device, to prevent it from overheating or short-circuiting. The UK is, metaphorically speaking, that faulty device. The phrase ""circuit-breaker"" is being used to describe a short, nationwide lockdown, to help slow the spread of Covid-19. Labour leader Keir Starmer has called for a circuit-breaker in England, after it emerged that the government's scientific advisers said it would be a good idea.As my colleague James Gallagher points out, the hope is a circuit-breaker would be less damaging - to the economy and to people's mental health - than the first lockdown we had. Not everyone is buying into the electrical metaphor. Wales's First Minister Mark Drakeford has instead termed the possibility of a two-week lockdown a ""fire-break"", designed to bring the virus rate down and help ""get us through to Christmas"". This video can not be played The BBC's Laura Foster explains what a circuit breaker is and how it could help tackle Covid-19 We measure the epidemic in several different ways, but coronavirus cases are definitely rising. Infections are going up rapidly, with an estimated 27,900 new cases a day in homes in England in the seven days up to 8 October - a 60% increase on the previous week - according to the Office for National Statistics. This figure is far higher than the number of confirmed cases announced by the government each day - which has risen to a daily average of 16,228 in the past week. Are we still listening to the science? Covid: What the science said and what No 10 did Also, the reproduction (R) number has risen slightly in the past week to between 1.3 and 1.5, according to the latest estimate. R is the average number of people that one infected person will pass the virus on to, so at the moment every 10 people infected in the UK will go on to infect between 13 and 15 others. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map There is some hope. Despite the continued rise in cases, experts have pointed out we are no longer seeing the runaway increase of a fortnight ago. And last month's morbid warning from scientiststhat the UK could face 50,000 cases a day by mid-Octoberhas not happened. With NHS Nightingale hospitals on standby,new financial support schemes, newly understood treatments, and protections for care homes, we are arguably better prepared for the second wave of coronavirus than we were for the first. But the ongoing uncertainty we face as we head into winter is not easy. If you're finding things tough, you're not alone - andthese mental health and well-being organisationscan help.

"An artist works on a mural in Manchester, where an argument over virus restrictions continues between local and national leaders Millions of people have seen Covid-19 rules tighten as areas have moved up England's new three-tier alert system. London and York are among those moving up to tier two, meaning people cannot mix with other households indoors. A stalemate continues between Greater Manchester's local leaders and central government over stricter new measures. Boris Johnson has said infection rates in Manchester are ""grave"" and he may ""need to intervene"" if a row over moving into tier three is not resolved. More than half of England - in excess of 28 million people - is now under extra coronavirus restrictions. How worried should we be? Make yourself a cuppa and get up to date with the rules Can I stay with my partner in Tier 2? And other questions Lancashire has joined the Liverpool City Region in the top tier - tier three. Pubs must close and the ban on mixing households extends to many outdoor settings. London, Essex, York, Elmbridge, Barrow-in-Furness, North East Derbyshire, Erewash and Chesterfield have moved into tier two, meaning they can no longer mix inside with those from other households, including in pubs and restaurants. Areas of England in the lowest tier must keep to the nationwide virus rules such as group sizes being capped at six people, and the hospitality industry closing at 22:00. Pubs, restaurants and cafes across Northern Ireland have closedto sit-in customers for the next four weeks. In Wales, a two-week ""fire break"" - a period with tighter restrictions to help break the trajectory of coronavirus cases rising  -is expected within days. Most licensed premises in Scotland's central belt are closed under temporary restrictions, which are expected to be replaced by a similar multi-tiered system to the one in England by the end of the month. Celtic and Rangers football fans are being urgednot to cross the border into England to watch the Old Firm gamein pubs on Saturday. This video can not be played There were scuffles between police and pub goers in Soho ahead of London moving to Tier 2 Greater Manchester's local leaders are resisting a move from tier two to tier three's strict rules on hospitality - pressing instead for more shielding measures for the vulnerable, extra financial aid and stricter local powers to shut down venues breaking virus guidelines. ""We firmly believe that protecting health is about more than controlling the virus and requires proper support for people whose lives would be severely affected by a tier three lockdown,"" the deputy mayors and council leaders said in a joint statement. ""We can assure the prime minister that we are ready to meet at any time to try to agree a way forward."" Mr Johnson warned on Friday that the situation in Manchester was worsening and thathe may intervene if the new measures cannot be agreedwith the region's leaders. But Kate Green, Labour MP for Stretford and Urmston said there had been no talks between the government and Greater Manchester's leaders on Friday because ""No 10 did not pick up the phone"" - with no further meetings expected until Monday. Rochdale council leader Allen Brett told BBC Newsnight: ""I stood by all day waiting for a meeting which never took place."" PM warns he may 'need to intervene' on Manchester 'Not knowing is killing the business' Local leaders in north-east England said they were committed to ""ongoing, constructive dialogue"" with central government. In a joint statement, council leaders in Northumberland, Newcastle, South and North Tyneside, Gateshead, Sunderland and County Durham urged residents to ""do their bit"" to avoid being put under tier three restrictions. Divisions over circuit-breaker Meanwhile, calls for a circuit-breaker - a short but strict national lockdown - have been supported by Labour as well as some Conservative MPs. Kate Green told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""The Labour leaders in Greater Manchester support the call for a national circuit-break because what we're seeing in Manchester today - the rest of the country is coming along behind. The rate is rising everywhere."" Ms Green, who is also shadow education secretary, added that extra restrictions would not be effective without a package of support to ""enable people to close their businesses [and] to isolate at home if they need to"". Conservative MP and former health secretary Jeremy Hunt called for an end to the ""public war of words"" between local and national leaders on Saturday, but added he had ""sympathy"" for the idea of a circuit-breaker. Britain's largest teachers' union, the National Education Union, has called for secondary schools in England to shut for two weeks at half term, rather than the traditional one week. Mr Johnson has said that while he could not ""rule anything out"", he wants to avoid a national lockdown because of ""the damaging health, economic and social effects it would have"". This video can not be played ""Time is of the essence"" for Manchester - Boris Johnson It comes as the hospitality industry warned of widespread job losses if businesses do not receive further financial support from the government. Some 750,000 hospitality jobs could be lost by February 2021, according to an industry survey by three trade bodies in the UK. ""Without urgent sector-specific support for our industry, massive business failure is imminent,"" a spokesman for UK Hospitality, the British Institute of Innkeeping and the British Beer & Pub Association said. Public Health England's medical director Yvonne Doyle told the Today programme that officials from local and national public health services were working ""extremely hard... to try and ensure that we do the right thing at the right time with the maximum amount of agreement"". She also urged the public to abide by the rules and ""understand why that's important"". Meanwhile, county councils in England are calling for the government to give local authorities more control over the test-and-trace system. The County Councils Network, which represents local authorities in mainly rural parts of the country, hopes to avoid the prospect of greater restrictions in these areas. The PM said on Friday that the UK was developing the capacity to manufacture millions of tests that could deliver results in just 15 minutes. THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? SOCIAL LIFE:Is it safe to go to the pub? The new tests are ""faster, simpler and cheaper"", Mr Johnson said, adding that work is being carried out to ensure they can be manufactured and distributed in the UK. The government has set a target of 500,000 tests a day by the end of the month. Oxford University's Sir John Bell, who has advised the government on its testing programme, told the Today programme it could be ""possible"" for the UK to carry out a million tests a day by Christmas - but added that logistics such as getting swabs to testing centres quickly were ""the limiting factor"".

The coverage has been brought to you by Sarah Collerton, George Bowden, Thomas Mackintosh, Joshua Cheetham and Paul Gribben.  There have been a further 16,171 coronavirus across the UK,the government's latest daily figures show,external. This brings the total number of positive Covid-19 infections to 705,428. A further 150 people have died within 28 days of a positive test - taking the total number of UK deaths to 43,579. Accountancy firm Deloitte has announced it is set to close four of its UK offices. Deloitte UK managing partner Stephen Griggs said: ""Covid-19 has fast-tracked our future of work programme, leading us to review our real estate portfolio and how we use our offices across the UK, including London."" The offices being closed are at Gatwick, Liverpool, Nottingham and Southampton. Mr Griggs said the firm is consulting with around 500 employees who work at those offices about the proposals. ""Everyone based in these locations will continue to be employed by
Deloitte and any proposed change is to our 'bricks and mortar', not our
presence in these regions,"" he said. ""We remain committed to these regional markets and will continue our close
relationships with our clients, society partners and communities, just without
a physical building."" In May, Deloitte scrapped its summer internship scheme forstudents in order to cut costs during the coronavirus crisis. Cinemas have started reopening in India after being closed for seven months due to the coronavirus pandemic. But watching a movie in a cinema won't be the same now - at least in the foreseeable future. There will be no eager crowds or long queues at the ticket counter as social distancing is enforced. Names and phone numbers will be collected at the entrance for contact tracing, and seating in cinema will be capped at 50% of the regular capacity. Even popcorn will be sterilised under UV rays for eight minutes,external, reported local media. But the biggest blow may well be the lack of new material - for months, cinemas watched helplessly from the sidelines as streaming platforms snapped up Bollywood movies that were willing to opt for an online release. This leaves cinemas with no option but to re-release older titles, including those from 2018. Read more about cinemas in India reopening here. Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent The Department of Health says an issue has been resolved with the NHS Covid-19 app, following complaints that it had failed to update when new local alert levels were introduced. Some users in London said the app didn't change its display after the level rose from medium to high. The BBC has
discovered the reason the app's risk level has been
updating at different times on users' handsets is down to cost. While in theory it
would be possible to configure enough remote computer servers to update
everyoneâs app simultaneously, this would be much more expensive than
staggering the risk level change transmissions. Those involved
believe that by spacing out the updates, they are offering better value to the
taxpayer. About
18 million people have now installed the app, according to a source, and the
more that do so the more need there is to avoid overwhelming the back-end
infrastructure, they explained. Iran's health ministry has reported that 253 coronavirus patients have died over the last 24 hours, bringing the national death toll to 30,123. Case numbers have also risen by 4,103 to 526,490, a ministry spokesperson told state TV channel IRINN. Iran's total number of deaths is the highest in the Middle East, and the 10th highest in the world, according to Johns Hopkins University data. Shortly after the latest figures were announced, Iranian authorities said they would be extending closures and restrictions in Tehran and four other cities for another week to help curb infections. Scottish Premiership side St Mirren have been forced to call off this afternoon's game with Motherwell after another member of their team tested positive
for Covid-19. Two players had already contracted the virus earlier this weekwith a third
forced into self-isolation. NowSt Mirren have postponed their showdown with Motherwellat the Simple
Digital Arena after the latest test result meant a number of other squad members
would have to go into self-isolation. Chief executive Tony Fitzpatrick added: ""It is very disappointing that
we are faced with this situation despite the numerous precautions and safeguards
that are in place within the club.""  A further 86 people who tested positive for coronavirus have died in hospital in England, new NHS data has shown. It brings the total number of confirmed deaths reported in English hospitals to 30,910. The NHS said the latest patients were aged between 44 and 99 and that all but two patients, aged 62 and 79, had known underlying health conditions. The deaths were between 16 September and 16 October. The
number of deaths of patients with Covid-19 by region are as follows: Belgium's Foreign Minister Sophie WilmÃ¨s has announced she has tested positive for coronavirus - saying she potentially contracted it from a family member. In a series of tweets, Ms WilmÃ¨s said that rising cases in the country were a reminder ""that no one is safe"". ""Take care of yourself and especially for each other,"" she added. It comes days after Ms WilmÃ¨s attended face-to-face talks with several other EU foreign ministers in Luxembourg. Since the 12 October meeting, Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg has also tested positive. As cases rise in Kansas City, in the US state of Missouri, many hospitals in and around the city are so full they are having to turn away ambulances and refuse non-emergency care,ABC News reports,external. Marc Larsen, an operations director at Saint Luke's hospital - the region's second largest care provider - told the American broadcaster that many hospitals are ""bursting at the seams"". ""The current trajectory and the rapid increase in infections is a big concern for me,"" said Mr Larsen. ""With our numbers where they are coming into influenza season, I worry that the facilities will continue to be pushed to the brink."" Missouri is one of several states in the midwestern US which is grappling with a surge in coronavirus cases. More than 11,200 have beenreported,externalover the last seven days, bringing the state's total number of cases to nearly 155,000. Scotland has recorded 15 deaths ofcoronavirus patients in the past 24 hours, the latest official figures show. This takes the death toll under this measure - of people who first tested positive for the virus within the previous 28 days - to 2,609. A total of 1,167 people have tested positive for the virus in the past 24 hours, bringing the total since the start of the pandemic to 46,399. There are 675 people in hospital confirmed to have the virus as of yesterday, up by 46 in 24 hours and of these patients, 62 were in intensive care, up by four. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent When two sides cannot even agree on the arrangement of a phone call, it doesn't bode well for the bigger picture. After 48 hours of stand-off between Downing Street and the mayor of Greater Manchester, it seemed there might be some progress. Downing Street claimed they had ""reached out"" and a call had been arranged between Andy Burnham and No 10 for Sunday morning. But soon after that Mr Burnham's spokesperson said nothing had been agreed. This may seem like a tedious running commentary on the logistics of negotiations, and on one level it is. But as coronavirus cases continue to rise there is a lot riding on these discussions, or lack of. People in Greater Manchester may be wondering how long it will be before action of some sort is taken, and what restrictions they'll be asked to endure when it is. People in Greater Manchester are facing confusion over Covid-19 rules, as local leaders denied Downing Street's claim that talks have been arranged to resolve a row over tougher restrictions. No 10 told the BBC it had arranged a call with the region's mayor, Andy Burnham, on Sunday morning. However, Mr Burnham's office said ""nothing has yet been arranged"". It comes after UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he may intervene to place Greater Manchester into tier three - very high - in England's new system of rules - something Mr Burnham has been resisting. He is instead pressing for more shielding measures for the vulnerable, extra financial aid and stricter local powers to shut down venues breaking virus guidelines. Read morehere. The Vatican has said that a man living in the same residence as Pope Francis has tested positive for coronavirus and is now in isolation. The man has not been named, and did not not show any symptoms of the illness before testing,according to a statement.,externalAn undisclosed number of people who came into contact with him have also been isolated. The Pope is regularly tested for Covid-19, and is continuing with his regular schedule, Reuters reports. It's not the first time this has happened. Back in March, someone else living in the residence - which has about 130 rooms and suites - contracted coronavirus during the height of Italy's outbreak.  There have been a further674 cases of Covid-19 recorded in Wales, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in the country to 34,679. Public Health Wales said five further deaths had been reported, with the total number of deaths since the beginning of the pandemic rising to 1,708.

A spokesperson told the BBC they had ""reached out"" to Mr Burnham on Saturday morning. The development comes after the prime minister yesterday said he would intervene and impose restrictions in the region if agreement couldn't be reached with local leaders. The mayor's office has been approached for comment but did not immediately respond. Read the latesthere. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent At least 48 hours have passed since there
was any discussion between the government and leaders in Greater Manchester. It's not complete radio silence - I
understand conversations have continued between officials inWhitehall and the region's local authorities. But there won't be a breakthrough until
politicians on one side pick up the phone. Both camps have indicated they're ready to
talk, but neither seems willing to make the first move. The prime minister did not put a time
limit onhis pledge to impose restrictionsif no agreement can be reached, but
he will only be able to wait so long. One thing everyone involved agrees on is
that something needs to be done as coronavirus casescontinue to rise,external. Given the political fault lines this row
has exposed - Conservative vs Labour, north vs south, local vs national - deciding
exactly what is proving far more difficult. The chief of Greater Manchester Police has defended its role in enforcing coronavirus regulations after a report suggested officers were caught in the middle of a political fight over tougher rules. Discussions between the government and local leaders overputting the region into the highest levelof restrictions are at a stalemate. A Daily Telegraph article said Boris Johnson has held back on new restrictions in Greater Manchester amid fears over enforcement of the rules because the police answer to Mayor Andy Burnham. But Ian Hopkins, Greater Manchester Police chief constable, said in a statement that it was for politicians to decide regulations andhis officers would enforce them proportionately,external. Ch Con Hopkins said the force's approach has been supported by both Greater Manchester's mayor and Home Secretary Priti Patel, and he has been in regular contact with them throughout the pandemic. Meanwhile, businesses in Greater Manchestersay they are frustratedby the uncertainty over whether the area will be moved into the highest level of restrictions. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Fans were allowed into the Coleraine Ballymena game on Friday night despite the confusion The minister responsible for sport in NI wants all games to happen behind closed doors, even though current regulations say some fans can attend. CarÃ¡l NÃ­ ChuilÃ­n told BBC News NI that fans can ""legally"" go, but appealed to sporting bodies to close their doors. New restrictions aimed at combating the spread of Covid-19 in NI came in on Friday. They are to last four weeks. On Saturday, two further coronavirus-related deaths were reported, bringing the Department of Health total to 610. Another 1,031 people tested positive for Covid-19, 231 people with the virus are in hospital and 27 of them are in intensive care. Northern Ireland schools to close and bars to shut Confusion over fans after Foster tweet At 18:00 BST on Friday,pubs, restaurants and cafes across NI closed their doorsto sit-in customers for the next four weeks. Executive ministers released the full public health guidance relating to the new restrictions on Friday night, but there was someconfusion though over whether spectators could still attend sporting events. A letter issued to sporting bodies by Minister for Communities CarÃ¡l NÃ­ ChuilÃ­n on Friday evening stated that fans were not permitted to attend under the new Covid-19 regulations. However, the First Minister Arlene Foster later said that this was not the case. ""The regulations do not ban fans from stadiums,"" she tweeted. ""The existing position is maintained, permitting a limited number to attend. Preposterous for clubs to be told anything to the contrary."" Allow Twitter content?

The executive announcement came just over an hour before the first match of the new Irish Premiership season. On Saturday morning, the Irish Football Association issued astatement welcoming the fact that fans ""will still be admitted at elite sporting events which are allowed under the regulations"". Later the communities minister, in an interview with BBC News NI, said she had issued her guidance following advice from Northern Ireland's chief medical officer and chief scientific adviser. ""I'm appealing to the sporting bodies to take my advice and to try to play their events behind closed doors because I think we all are trying our best to be safe, to protect lives and to protect each other,"" said Ms NÃ­ ChuilÃ­n. ""I have a duty as minister of sport to ensure that not only are the sporting bodies, the fans, but the general public are protected."" The IFA said that it had worked tirelessly to ensure protocols were in place for the safe return of fans. Gerard Lawlor, chairman of Cliftonville Football, said the future of football was at risk if they could not let fans into games. ""We need financial support from Stormont and if that's coming we can all sit down together and look at the situation,"" he said. ""Today we have asked for an urgent meeting with the executive to plan the way forward."" The minster said she was preparing a bid for ""substantial money to try and help those clubs"", but would bring the issue of supporters at games to her executive colleagues next week. Ms NÃ­ ChuilÃ­n appealed to executive ministers to ""do the right thing"". ""I cannot ignore the medical and scientific advice. It's really important that we collectively as an executive adhere to that advice."" On Friday,Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots said he had ""grave reservations"" about new coronavirus restrictions agreed by the executive. Hospitality businesses will only be allowed to offer takeaway and delivery services for four weeks Most of the measures were announced on Wednesday, but the guidance published on Friday night does provide more clarity on which sectors and services will be affected. As well as the closure of the hospitality sector (apart from deliveries and takeaways), off-licences and supermarkets are not to sell alcohol after 20:00, and fast-food and takeaway premises are to close at 23:00. There was also confirmation that driving instructors must stop offering lessons and as a result, the Department of Infrastructure has also decided to suspend driving tests. The department says the 2,500 customers who have booked a test in the next four weeks will have their appointments cancelled, refunded and rescheduled. However, as driving tests are already booked out until January, some of those affected may not be able to get a slot until February. Other restrictions laid out in the guidance are: No indoor sport or organised contact sport involving mixing of households, other than at elite level No mass events involving more than 15 people (except for allowed outdoor sporting events where the relevant number for that will continue to apply) Close-contact services such as hairdressers and beauticians to close - apart from those relating to the continuation of essential health interventions and therapeutics Mobile hairdressers and make-up artists - also classed as close contact services - prohibited from working in homes Gyms to remain open for individual training but no classes permitted Places of worship to remain open but face coverings mandatory when entering and exiting Wedding ceremonies and civil partnerships to be limited to 25 people with no receptions.  This will be implemented on Monday 19 October Funerals to be limited to 25 people with no pre or post-funeral gatherings Hotels to close, with exemptions for them to offer rooms to essential workers such as workers who need hotels for work-related purposes and ""staff on the front line battling Covid"" A Â£35mscheme designed to help the businesses forced to shutwill open for applications from Monday and will make payments for every fortnight a business is are closed.

"Pubs, restaurants and cafes across NI closed their doors to sit-in customers at 18:00 BST on Friday understricter Covid-19 restrictions. Hair and beauty salons also have to shut and gyms face additional measures for the next four weeks too. Belfast Chamber of Commerce chief executive Simon Hamilton said a support package for businesses ""didn't cut it"". It also emerged on Friday that driving instructors will be taken off the road. Ministers released the fullpublic health regulations and guidance,externalrelating to the new restrictions on Friday night. On Thursday Finance Minister Conor Murphy announced hotels would be able to apply to ascheme designed to help businesses forced to shut. The additional financial support comes afternew restrictions were announced in a bid to stem cases of Covid-19. Mr Murphy said the package was intended to get support to businesses quickly. But Mr Hamilton said it was ""paltry in comparison to the costs that many businesses are going to face"". He told BBC News NI's Good Morning Ulster: ""The chancellor and the government don't appear to be too keen to provide more money for what they describe as localised lockdowns, so I am really, really concerned, having talked to members over the last 24/48 hours, that this is just too far for them, this is too much."" NI circuit breaker: New restrictions in full,external New Covid support announced for NI firms NI Covid-19 restrictions: Your Questions Answered Mr Hamilton warned there was a risk of thousands of job losses. Simon Hamilton said much more support was needed for businesses The scheme will see payments available to businesses every fortnight that they are closed, on a tiered level. It is set to cost Â£35m and will open for applications from Monday. Hospitality Ulster chief Colin Neill echoed Mr Hamilton's views, saying the support was vital but was ""nowhere near enough"". He said: ""We now need the prime minister, the chancellor and the treasury to listen up, level up and stop sitting on their hands."" Mr Neill called for more emergency funding to be given to Stormont to help hospitality businesses ""in dire need"". The new scheme will see small businesses receive Â£1,600 every fortnight that they are in lockdown, medium businesses Â£2,400 and large firms getting Â£3,200. The thresholds are: Small businesses with a net annual value (NAV) up to Â£15,000 Medium businesses with a NAV of Â£15,001 to Â£51,000 Large businesses with NAV of Â£51,001 or more Jenny Sherlock owns Inner Beauty in the seaside town of Millisle, County Down. Before the coronavirus pandemic, a Friday usually meant her beauty salon was buzzing with people getting ready for the weekend. Hairdressers, makeup artists and beauticians rent chairs at the salon to provide their services, but their businesses never really got off the ground once lockdown restrictions eased. Staff were busy on Friday trying to fit as many clients in as possible ahead of the closure, this time hopefully for only four weeks. ""We had to supply all posters, floor stickers, desk and table top shields and dividing sections. All PPE had to be provided, as we all wore masks, face shields, disposable aprons and gloves in a bid to limit the spread of coronavirus,"" she said. ""We sanitised all the work stations after each client and implemented a one-in-one-out system, meaning staff had to rotate their working hours and days so that we didn't have clients clash. ""Having been told we've now to close again after doing everything possible to keep open is disheartening and mentally draining with all the worrying about what's happening and how bills are going to get paid, never mind how we're going to afford to reopen again when the time comes."" Wednesday saw new measures announced for all of Northern Ireland, with schools closing for two weeks from Monday: Closure of the hospitality sector, apart from deliveries and takeaways Other fast-food and takeaway premises to close at 23:00 Off-licences and supermarkets not to sell alcohol after 20:00 No indoor sport or organised contact sport involving mixing of households, other than at elite level No mass events involving more than 15 people (except for allowed outdoor sporting events where the relevant number for that will continue to apply); Close-contact services such as hairdressers and beauticians to close - apart from those relating to the continuation of essential health interventions and therapeutics.

"An artist works on a mural in Manchester, where an argument over virus restrictions continues between local and national leaders Millions of people have seen Covid-19 rules tighten as areas have moved up England's new three-tier alert system. London and York are among those moving up to tier two, meaning people cannot mix with other households indoors. A stalemate continues between Greater Manchester's local leaders and central government over stricter new measures. Boris Johnson has said infection rates in Manchester are ""grave"" and he may ""need to intervene"" if a row over moving into tier three is not resolved. More than half of England - in excess of 28 million people - is now under extra coronavirus restrictions. How worried should we be? Make yourself a cuppa and get up to date with the rules Can I stay with my partner in Tier 2? And other questions Lancashire has joined the Liverpool City Region in the top tier - tier three. Pubs must close and the ban on mixing households extends to many outdoor settings. London, Essex, York, Elmbridge, Barrow-in-Furness, North East Derbyshire, Erewash and Chesterfield have moved into tier two, meaning they can no longer mix inside with those from other households, including in pubs and restaurants. Areas of England in the lowest tier must keep to the nationwide virus rules such as group sizes being capped at six people, and the hospitality industry closing at 22:00. Pubs, restaurants and cafes across Northern Ireland have closedto sit-in customers for the next four weeks. In Wales, a two-week ""fire break"" - a period with tighter restrictions to help break the trajectory of coronavirus cases rising  -is expected within days. Most licensed premises in Scotland's central belt are closed under temporary restrictions, which are expected to be replaced by a similar multi-tiered system to the one in England by the end of the month. Celtic and Rangers football fans are being urgednot to cross the border into England to watch the Old Firm gamein pubs on Saturday. This video can not be played There were scuffles between police and pub goers in Soho ahead of London moving to Tier 2 Greater Manchester's local leaders are resisting a move from tier two to tier three's strict rules on hospitality - pressing instead for more shielding measures for the vulnerable, extra financial aid and stricter local powers to shut down venues breaking virus guidelines. ""We firmly believe that protecting health is about more than controlling the virus and requires proper support for people whose lives would be severely affected by a tier three lockdown,"" the deputy mayors and council leaders said in a joint statement. ""We can assure the prime minister that we are ready to meet at any time to try to agree a way forward."" Mr Johnson warned on Friday that the situation in Manchester was worsening and thathe may intervene if the new measures cannot be agreedwith the region's leaders. But Kate Green, Labour MP for Stretford and Urmston said there had been no talks between the government and Greater Manchester's leaders on Friday because ""No 10 did not pick up the phone"" - with no further meetings expected until Monday. Rochdale council leader Allen Brett told BBC Newsnight: ""I stood by all day waiting for a meeting which never took place."" PM warns he may 'need to intervene' on Manchester 'Not knowing is killing the business' Local leaders in north-east England said they were committed to ""ongoing, constructive dialogue"" with central government. In a joint statement, council leaders in Northumberland, Newcastle, South and North Tyneside, Gateshead, Sunderland and County Durham urged residents to ""do their bit"" to avoid being put under tier three restrictions. Divisions over circuit-breaker Meanwhile, calls for a circuit-breaker - a short but strict national lockdown - have been supported by Labour as well as some Conservative MPs. Kate Green told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""The Labour leaders in Greater Manchester support the call for a national circuit-break because what we're seeing in Manchester today - the rest of the country is coming along behind. The rate is rising everywhere."" Ms Green, who is also shadow education secretary, added that extra restrictions would not be effective without a package of support to ""enable people to close their businesses [and] to isolate at home if they need to"". Conservative MP and former health secretary Jeremy Hunt called for an end to the ""public war of words"" between local and national leaders on Saturday, but added he had ""sympathy"" for the idea of a circuit-breaker. Britain's largest teachers' union, the National Education Union, has called for secondary schools in England to shut for two weeks at half term, rather than the traditional one week. Mr Johnson has said that while he could not ""rule anything out"", he wants to avoid a national lockdown because of ""the damaging health, economic and social effects it would have"". This video can not be played ""Time is of the essence"" for Manchester - Boris Johnson It comes as the hospitality industry warned of widespread job losses if businesses do not receive further financial support from the government. Some 750,000 hospitality jobs could be lost by February 2021, according to an industry survey by three trade bodies in the UK. ""Without urgent sector-specific support for our industry, massive business failure is imminent,"" a spokesman for UK Hospitality, the British Institute of Innkeeping and the British Beer & Pub Association said. Public Health England's medical director Yvonne Doyle told the Today programme that officials from local and national public health services were working ""extremely hard... to try and ensure that we do the right thing at the right time with the maximum amount of agreement"". She also urged the public to abide by the rules and ""understand why that's important"". Meanwhile, county councils in England are calling for the government to give local authorities more control over the test-and-trace system. The County Councils Network, which represents local authorities in mainly rural parts of the country, hopes to avoid the prospect of greater restrictions in these areas. The PM said on Friday that the UK was developing the capacity to manufacture millions of tests that could deliver results in just 15 minutes. THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? SOCIAL LIFE:Is it safe to go to the pub? The new tests are ""faster, simpler and cheaper"", Mr Johnson said, adding that work is being carried out to ensure they can be manufactured and distributed in the UK. The government has set a target of 500,000 tests a day by the end of the month. Oxford University's Sir John Bell, who has advised the government on its testing programme, told the Today programme it could be ""possible"" for the UK to carry out a million tests a day by Christmas - but added that logistics such as getting swabs to testing centres quickly were ""the limiting factor"".

"Ali Hirsz says she was ""shocked"" when the donation appeared. A singer from Cambridge will be able to have vital surgery, thanks to the Manic Street Preachers. Ali Hirsz needs the trapezius muscle that runs from her neck to her shoulder rebuilt, in an operation that isn't available on the NHS. After Covid-19 robbed her of income from live music, she had toask fans to help raise the money,externalfor the operation. Her initial crowd-funding goal was Â£1,000 - but once she reached Â£500, the Manics stepped in and paid the rest. When the donation arrived, ""I was in tears,"" she tells the BBC. ""I love them anyway, they're such a great band, but Â£500 is so unbelievably generous. I thought, 'I can't believe they've done that.' ""It's such a relief."" Representatives for the Manic Street Preachers confirmed to the BBC that the donation had come from the band. Hirsz, who sings with an indie band called Idealistics, has an incurable connective tissue disorder called Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. The condition means ""my skin is like tissue paper, it tears really easy,"" says the 20-year-old. A vascular compression on her small intestine also requires her to be fed via a tube. She needs corrective surgery on her shoulder after a previous operation severed the nerve to her trapezius muscle, causing it to waste away. As a result, her shoulder blade dropped, affecting the blood supply to her arm. The condition has already forced her to stop playing bass, as she has little feeling in her left hand. She says she has ""never asked for money before"" and was ""sweating with nerves"" before posting her crowd-funding request last week. But the campaign became necessary after coronavirus wiped out her band's concert diary; and Hirsz had to leave her day job as a horse trainer because she was shielding. Hundreds of musicians protest outside Parliament Disabled 'pushed out' of post-lockdown world Niall Horan to play show for 'forgotten' crew In the the meantime, she says, she received no financial support from the government's furlough or self-employment support schemes. ""It is very, very stressful, particularly in times where you don't have money lying around anyway,"" she says. Ali (left) formed Idealistics as a teenager with her partner George Gillott and sister, Dom, on drums. The response to her campaign has been ""overwhelming"", however. Hirsz hit the Â£1,000 goal within 24 hours, and has since increased her target to Â£5,000. ""Because the surgery's not been done before, we don't know exactly how much it's going to cost,"" she explains. ""I know it's a hard time for everyone,"" she adds, ""so all these donations mean everything."" Hirsz says her story is typical of disabled musicians, who have found themselves left high and dry by the Covid-19 pandemic. Singer-songwriter Chloe Mogg, who has both fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome, agrees the last six months have been ""really, really tough"". ""The NHS is doing an amazing job at the moment but, especially with chronic fatigue syndrome, it seems like all the invisible illnesses have been pushed to the side,"" she says. ""We're walking on a tightrope and we don't know if we're going to fall off at any stage."" Mogg says she has faced discrimination from venues and promoters because of her condition But Mogg, like Hirsz, has approached the pandemic with imagination and resilience, channelling her energies into organising an online music and arts festival. CalledThe 7 Arts Still Exist,external, it highlights the work created by artists, designers, sculptors, writers, musicians, dancers and photographers during the pandemic. Mogg is already lining up its third event with her childhood friend Amy Crouch. The musician says the pandemic has taught her to ""live more in the present moment"", even when ""it felt like I've been put on pause"". ""It's been tough for me and it's been tough for a lot of musician friends who have anxiety problems,"" she says. ""It's something we're learning to adapt to - but I don't feel like we should be needing to adapt. It's really, really tough."" For visually-impaired sitar player Baluji Shrivastav, adaptability has been the watchword for the last six months. The 70-year-old, who has played with Oasis, Stevie Wonder, Massive Attack, Kylie Minogue and Coldplay, cannot travel during the pandemic, making it ""very difficult to perform anywhere"". ""But we still meet sometimes,"" he says. ""We are allowed to meet six people in one place, and we have a garden so we rehearse there sometimes - but it will be difficult in the winter."" Baluji Shrivastav played at the Paralympic closing ceremony with Coldplay Shrivastav was appointed an OBE in 2016 for his services to music, after founding the Inner Vision Orchestra, whose players are all blind or partially-sighted. He says live-streamed concerts are harder for blind musicians, because communication between players is reliant on physical proximity. Meeting up for socially-distanced concerts poses other problems. ""Even if we can reach the venue without help, we need help within the venue itself,"" he says. ""It's a constant difficulty for visually-impaired people. ""And, of course, financially, we are not earning at all."" According to theUK Disability Arts Alliance #WeShallNotBeRemoved,external, the pandemic has had a particularly negative impact on disabled people working in the creative industries. In anopen letter to the secretary of state for culture,external, Oliver Dowden MP, the alliance warned that ""many disabled artists are facing long term shielding, a total loss of income, compromised independent living and the risk of invisibility in wider society"". Separately, the Audience Access Alliance - which represents 12 disability charities in the UK - says it is ""deeply concerned"" that disabled people will miss out on access to gigs, theatre and sport when venues reopen because of extra Covid-related precautions and restrictions. ""If we want to 'build back better', it's vital that we build back for all,""the organisation wrote in an open letter,externalto the live music industry earlier this month. The fear for both organisations is that the progress made since the UK's equality act came into force 10 years ago will be lost. Hirsz and Mogg both have horror stories about the discrimination they faced before Covid. One promoter refused to work with Idealistics because of Hirsz's condition. ""They said, 'You've got all these [feeding] tubes and nobody wants to see that.  You're just going to deter a crowd,'"" she recalls. Mogg was also berated by a promoter last year, after a flare-up of fibromyalgia forced her to pull out of a show. ""He was like, 'You're a massive disappointment,'"" she says. ""It was so embarrassing. I felt really ridiculed and ashamed of my illness, even though it's part of me."" Despite the challenges like those, Hirsz, Mogg and Shrivastav are determined to stay active throughout the pandemic. The Idealistics have just released their new singleMemory River,external(inspired, naturally, by the Manic Street Preachers), while Hirsz is working as an advocate for disability charity Attitude is Everything.
