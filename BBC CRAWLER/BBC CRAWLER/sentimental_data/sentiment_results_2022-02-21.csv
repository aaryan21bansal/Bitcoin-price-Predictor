"Tributes have been paid at Stormont to Christopher Stalford afterthe DUP assembly member's sudden death aged 39. Mr Stalford was principal deputy speaker and had represented South Belfast since 2016, having served previously as councillor, high sheriff of Belfast and deputy mayor. He is survived by his wife Laura and four children. Ahead of the sitting, DUP assembly members gathered in the Great Hall at Stormont to pray. They were led by North Antrim MLA Mervyn Storey. Some then entered the chamber, with others heading to the assembly gallery which has been opened specially for other MLAs to sit and watch the tributes, because social distancing rules are still in place in the chamber limiting numbers. After tributes had been paid, members took part in a minute's silence to reflect on Mr Stalford's life. Ahead of the sitting, DUP assembly members gathered in the Great Hall at Stormont to pray Mr Stalford's death was announced on Sunday and the tributes,paid across the political spectrum, referenced his wry humour, passion for politics and debate, and love for his wife and children.

""It was a mark of the man that he had friends on all sides of this chamber."" Before tributes began, DUP MLAs gathered together just outside the chamber in the great hall, led in prayer by the party's Mervyn Storey. The DUP deputy leader Paula Bradley spoke tearfully as she thanked other parties for their kind tributes.

The former Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill has Covid so is not present. Instead, Deirdre Hargey, the communities minister, led the tributes for Sinn FÃ©in. The South Belfast MLA said she first met Mr Stalford at Belfast City Council and ""instantly thought he was older than me due to his mannerisms and his attire of his pinstriped suit, initially thinking this was the instructed uniform of all DUP councillors at that time"". Ms Hargey said he ""enjoyed the cut and thrust"" of debate and loved talking about his family, faith and unionism. ""Whilst our politics differed, we shared similarities, growing up in working class communities in south Belfast,"" she added. Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) MLA Nichola Mallon told the chamber she had known the DUP MLA for 10 years. ""In all that time, I got to know a man who was challenging, argumentative, ambitious, some may even say combative, during debates but also a man who was kind, who was quick-witted, fiercely intelligent and very, very funny,"" Ms Mallon said. She said his love for his wife and children ""just radiated from him"". On Sunday, SDLP leader Colum Eastwoodpostponed his party's conferenceout of respect. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, Christopher Stalford and his wife Laura in 2010 UUP leader Doug Beattie told the chamber Mr Stalford was ""absolutely unique, he was a fierce debater"".

""I didn't just like Christopher Stalford, I was jealous of Christopher Stalford as he was truly a first class politician and family man."" Allow Twitter content?

Alliance Party leader Naomi Long said she first met Mr Stalford during their time at Belfast City Council. She added that during his tenure as principal deputy speaker, Mr Stalford was ""fair, he could be fierce, he kept us all in order"", but ""used his wit and self-deprecating humour and you never felt that when you were stopped or challenged by him that there was any animosity or personal discord behind it"". ""We had very different political backgrounds and views but we had a lot in common,"" adding that they were ""opponents but friends"". ""We both lost our fathers at a young age, we were both fiercely proud of coming from working class backgrounds, we both had a passion for the communities we grow up in that drove us into politics and we both believed passionately that education was the route to lift people permanently out of disadvantage in life and we shared a deep faith. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said Mr Stalford was passionate about Northern Ireland Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) leader Jim Allister told the chamber that he was still having difficulty processing the shock of Mr Stalford's passing. ""That pales into total insignificance compared to the devastation that undoubtedly his beloved wife Laura and beautiful children are experiencing,"" he added, sending them his condolences. He said Mr Stalford had come to work for him 20 years ago in his Belfast office. ""It was evident to me that he had the ability and talent which would make him the politician that he was,"" he said. ""Though our political perspectives diverged, I am pleased to say we retained a friendship and respect."" People Before Profit's Gerry Carroll said he could ""only imagine the heartbreak"" Mr Stalford's family were going through. The West Belfast MLA said that he and Mr Stalford had ""robust debate and strong disagreements"" when they first met at Belfast City Hall in 2014. Mr Carroll said he was ""an absolutely fair speaker, someone who went out of his way to ensure all voices were heard in debates"". DUP's Christopher Stalford dies aged 39 MLAs pay tribute to Christopher Stalford Clare Sugden, an independent MLA, said his passing was ""devastating"" and that she ""felt numb"" when she heard the news of his passing, and still does. ""We have lost one of our own. He was the epitome of public service,"" she said. He was incredibly ""funny and full of wit"" said the East Londonderry representative. Green Party leader Clare Bailey paid tribute to Mr Stalford's ""absolute natural talent"". She said he was a witty man but one that, when his wit cut, it was ""never with malice, and that's how he stood out"". ""I do believe that this assembly and NI politics will miss him and I will miss him,"" she said. Christopher Stalford with his DUP colleague Carla Lockhart and former leader Arlene Foster Earlier, DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said he last spoke to Mr Stalford on Friday. ""I was never to know how precious that conversation was to be,"" he told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme. ""A young man who came a long way, from a working class background in south Belfast to the deputy principal speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly - something he was immensely proud of. ""More than anything else and with his love for politics, the one thing that stood out about Christopher was his love for his family. ""His desire to create a better future for his children was something that drove him on."" Mr Stalford sat on the board of governors at Braniel Primary School. On Monday morning, Diane Dawson, headteacher at Braniel Primary School, said Mr Stalford was ""passionate"" about education and ""wanted the best for every single child irrespective of their background, or their creed or their colour or their denomination"". ""We have a very integrated school here in Braniel Nursery and Primary and Christopher championed that,"" she said. She said she had the privilege of knowing him as a father and a husband. ""What I saw with Christopher was his sense of fairness and wanting equality for every child in this school.""

"This video can not be played Watch: Jamal Edwards speaking in 2016 and 2017, sharing business advice and the reason he got into film-making Prince Charles and rappers Dave and AJ Tracey are among the many voices paying tribute to entrepreneur and YouTube star Jamal Edwards. Edwards, who has died at the age of 31, is the son of singer and presenter Brenda Edwards, who said she was ""completely devastated"". The Prince of Walespaid tribute,externalto his work for The Prince's Trust. Davesimply wrote,external: ""Thank you for everything. Words can't explain"" whileTracey said,externalhe was a ""legend"". Prince Charles was among the figures paying tribute to Jamal Edwards Edwards was the founder of SBTV, an online grime and rap music platform which helped launch the careers of artists like Dave, Ed Sheeran and Skepta. He first got into film-making after his parents gave him a video camera as a Christmas present when he was 15. Born in Luton and later moving to west London, he was appointed an MBE for services to music in 2014. A pioneering figure in British rap and grime music, Edwards attended the Brit Awards earlier this month, and was understood to have performed as a DJ at a gig in north London on Saturday night. His company confirmed his death to the BBC on Sunday, saying he died that morning. His mother said he ""passed away after a sudden illness"". Allow Twitter content?

The Prince's Trustdescribed him in a tweet as,external""an incredible innovator and entrepreneur."" Actor Idris Elbatweeted,externalthat Edwards would ""be missed"", while businessman Sir Richard Branson, who wrote the forward for Edwards' 2013 book, Self Belief: The Vision,tweeted,externalthat the star was ""a truly extraordinary young man who made a huge difference to so many people's lives"". 'Every young guy wanted to do what Jamal was doing' I May Destroy You starMichaela Coel said,external: ""May his passion, joy and relentless desire to platform British artists be an inspiration."" Former prime minister David Cameron, who is chair of the National Citizen Service's Board of Patrons,paid tribute,externalto Edwards for ""supporting and inspiring young people to be the best they could be, leading from the front and showing what's possible with hard work and determination"". London Mayor Sadiq Khantweeted,externalthat British music and entertainment ""has lost one of its brightest stars"", while Chelsea Football Clubadded,externalthat Edwards - a Chelsea fan - was ""an inspiration to many, we're honoured that he was part of our Chelsea family"". In 2019, he directed theChelsea FC remix video,externalof grime artist Capo Lee's Style and Swag, and the video featured several of the team's players. It's impossible to overstate how important Jamal Edwards was to British rap. His YouTube channel, which was started ""on a Â£20 phone"" while he was still at school, has given early exposure to almost every key player in the game. Stormzy, Skepta, JME, J Hus, Lady Leshurr, Dave, AJ Tracey, Krept & Konan, Headie Oneâ¦ the list is endless. To an extent, SBTV was formed out of frustration. ""Everyone in my area was an MC and I remember thinking, 'Why can't I find these online? I'm going to film people in my area and upload it to Youtube',""Edwards told BBC Radio 1Xtra in 2017,external. ""And from there it just started building and growing."" SBTV arrived at a crucial time, showing that grime could thrive online, while police were attempting to shut down gigs with the controversial risk-assessment form 696. The channel's success meant Edwards became known as an entrepreneur and businessman - but he was a reluctant frontman. ""I wanted to be the Banksy,"" he said. ""I wanted no-one to know who I was."" That changed in 2011, when he featured in an advert for Google Chrome. His name was searched more than a million times. and people started approaching him for selfies. But he put his fame to good use - raising awareness of mental health, funding youth centres and encouraging other young entrepreneurs. Music remained his true passion, though, and he never stopped supporting the artists he loved. As recently as December, he encouraged Ed Sheeran to record a new verse for a song he'd discovered by Nigerian artist Fireboy DML. That track,Peru,external, climbed to number two in the UK charts, giving the African star his first international hit. Edwards took no credit - he never did - but hundreds of artists have similar stories. His loss will be felt throughout the UK music scene. BBC 1Xtra DJ and presenter Nadia Jae told Newsbeat that Edwards ""helped me with my career"", adding: ""He's helped so many people, put them in places that they never would have been and did a lot of the pushing of doors to make sure that our industry is as fruitful as it is now."" She added: ""He had a heart of gold, I don't know anyone who has a bad word to say about Jamal. ""He broke so many barriers, I don't know if we're ever going to get another Jamal."" Presenter and comedian Mo Gilligan, who hosted this year's Brit awards,tweeted,external: ""A truly humble and blessed soul. Your legacy will live on for years and you've inspired a whole generation."" Rapper Lady Leshurrsaid,external: ""He gave me opportunity after opportunity to showcase my talent from Brum into London. We need to keep his name and brand alive."" Singer Jessie J, whose early appearances on SBTV helped get her noticed, said her ""heart is broken"".

""He will be remembered in every conversation when it comes to pioneers. This will be the person that put me on or gave me my first opportunity."" At a vigil in west London, fans and friends also paid tribute. ""He was the hero of Acton. He was the guy who showed you could make it out without being a drug dealer, without getting involved in crime or anything,"" Zachary Thomas told the BBC. Dominic Magliore said: ""It's hard to accept it. I heard about it yesterday and I saw him on Friday, we was hugging, laughing and having a good time & everything seemed ok."" Sam Borelli said: ""Jamal was the guy that showed kids from low-income households that you are not limited to what your grades might tell you.

In a 2013 interview with the BBC, Edwards said he filmed friends rapping or singing and began to upload the videos to YouTube to allow other friends to see them.

The highest wind gust speeds on Monday morningreached,external79mph in Capel Curig in Wales, and 78mph in Orlock Head, Northern Ireland. On Sunday night, 87mph was recorded at the Needles on the Isle of Wight. TheMet Office issued two weather warnings,externalfor earlier on Monday: an amber warning for wind in Northern Ireland, and a milder yellow warning for wind covering Wales, Northern Ireland, most of England and parts of south-west Scotland. Storm Franklin is the third named storm in a week - following Dudley and Eunice - the first time this has happened since the storm-naming system was introduced in 2015. This video can not be played Windy conditions at Birmingham Airport On Monday evening,UK Power Networks said,externalit had restored electricity to 98% of properties across east and south-east England but 8,500 remained without power. Energy minister Greg Hands said power outages were a ""horrible thing"" to happen to households and lessons would be learned for the energy network. He said: ""Quite often very significant lessons do get learned - the 105 emergency number for power outages was a lesson learned from a previous storm.""

Elsewhere, the O2 arena in London willremain closeduntil Friday, when a UB40 concert is expected to go ahead as planned, after Storm Eunice shredded sections of the roof. George Goodfellow, from BBC weather, says the forecast for the rest of the week is best described as unsettled: ""We're expecting further spells of wet and windy weather for most of the coming week, and some parts of the UK will see strong winds at times. ""It looks as though the strongest winds will generally be towards the north west of the UK. Whether the winds will be strong enough to warrant the Met Office naming another storm is a bit uncertain. ""Warnings are usually issued based on the risk of disruption/hazardous weather, so I think the question is will it become significantly windier than normal. If so then warnings are likely, and I wouldn't rule out a named storm."" Storms have been more frequent in the last week because of a strong jet stream running across the Atlantic and the UK - the coming week sees the jet stream move ""a little further north"".

"Stormont passed legislation making coercive control a specific offence in January last year New domestic abuse laws have come into force in Northern Ireland. Stormont passed legislation making coercive control a specific offence in January last year. Coercive control includes psychological and financial abuse and non-violent intimidation. Justice Minister Naomi Long said the new offence was a ""milestone"" and a ""real step change"" which would bring with it the potential for longer sentences. The new offence came into effect withthe launch of a campaign to raise awareness,externalof the new legislation, including a website wherepeople can find out more about domestic abuse,external. ""Domestic abuse is wrong and will not be tolerated, not by our community and crucially now not by the law,"" said Mrs Long. ""No longer will those that abuse a loved one, be that a partner, former partner, or a close family member be able to evade justice. Abusers will be punished. ""The changes brought forward will help many people, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, age, class, race or religion. ""This is particularly important given that anyone can be a victim, just as anyone can be an abuser."" Victims 'can have confidence' in new abuse laws Coercive control: 'I was 16 and thought it was normal' Chief Constable Simon Byrne said it was a ""defining moment for our criminal justice system"". ""Officers and staff members have been trained to recognise and respond to reports of coercive control and how to use the new powers they now have to safeguard children that witness any form of domestic abuse,"" he said. ""Domestic abuse is not just physical. ""As of today, we are now empowered to address what has been invisible, in plain sight, for so long."" Legislation to make stalking criminal in Northern Ireland is also expected to pass its final hurdle at Stormont this week. If you have been affected by any of the issues in this article, there is a list of organisations that may be able to help atBBC Action Line.

The alleged offences took place between April and August 2019, two years before the murder of the 33-year-old marketing executive. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said the charges arose from an investigation into the phone records of Couzens. The Met said the serving officers had been suspended from duty. Last week, when the charges were first announced, the CPS said that it could not release the men's names due to ""operational reasons"". But on Monday their identities were published, as is standard in criminal cases after charges have been brought. Met Police Deputy Assistant Commissioner Bas Javid said: ""I am deeply concerned to hear two serving officers and a former officer have been charged with these offences.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson has announced the end of coronavirus restrictions in England All Covid restrictions will end in England on Thursday and free mass testing will stop from 1 April. The prime minister told MPs the legal duty to isolate for those who tested positive would be dropped as he unveiled his""living with Covid"" plan,external. From 1 April the provision of free testing would be targeted to the most vulnerable, Boris Johnson said. But the British Medical Association, a doctors' union, said the plan failed to protect those most at risk from Covid. And opposition parties said the prime minister's blueprint out of the pandemic had moved too fast, and voiced concern over the scaling back of free testing. The Scottish government said the public health advice it had received did not recommend lifting the restrictions. An axe has been taken to testing - does it matter? What is England's 'Living with Covid' plan? Spring Covid booster for over-75s and high risk Businesses warn against end of free Covid tests Speaking at a Downing Street news conference on Monday evening, Mr Johnson said ""today is not the day we can declare victory over Covid because this virus is not going away"". He described the pandemic as ""two of the darkest, grimmest years in our peacetime history"". However, he said the nation had passed the peak of Omicron, with falling cases and hospital admissions. And he said the country could now complete the ""transition back towards normality"" while retaining contingencies to respond to a Covid resurgence or a new variant. England's chief medical officer Prof Sir Chris Whitty said the ending of virus restrictions was a ""gradual, steady change over a period of time"", adding: ""This is not a sudden 'everything stops'."" He said the number of people being infected with Omicron was still ""very high"". Office for National Statistics (ONS) infection figures last week estimated that one in 20 people in England had Covid. Sir Chris said the public health advice for people with Covid would still be to self-isolate to prevent others catching it, as it would be for many other highly infectious diseases. Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK government's chief scientific adviser, warned the virus would continue to evolve over the next couple of years and there was no guarantee that future variants would be less severe than Omicron. He argued it was crucial the nation retained a virus surveillance system to monitor new threats and the capacity to ""ramp up"" measures again quickly to protect the vulnerable. From 21 February: the government is dropping guidance for staff and students in most education and childcare settings to undertake twice weekly asymptomatic testing From Thursday 24 February: People who test positive for Covid will no longer be legally required to self-isolate But they will still be advised to stay at home and avoid contact with others for at least five full days Routine contact tracing will end, so fully-vaccinated close contacts and those under 18 will no longer be legally required to test daily for seven days The Â£500 self-isolation support payment for people on low incomes who test positive for Covid will no longer be available Covid provisions for increased statutory sick pay will apply for a further month From 1 April: Free mass symptomatic and asymptomatic testing for the general public will end, and will instead be targeted towards the most vulnerable People with Covid symptoms will be asked to exercise personal responsibility when deciding whether to stay at home - until then they are still advised to do so Current government guidance on Covid passports will end and it will no longer recommend venues use the NHS Covid pass You can read more about the changes here Earlier, Mr Johnson told MPs it was time to move from government restrictions to people exercising personal responsibility. It was only because levels of immunity were so high and deaths were now ""below where you would normally expect for this time of year"" that the government could lift the restrictions, he said. As Omicron was less severe, testing for it ""on the colossal scale we've been doing"" was less important and less valuable in preventing serious illness, he added. Limited free lateral flow tests for the most vulnerable groups would still be provided, the PM said, and ministers would work with retailers to ensure everyone who wanted a test could buy one. The PM did not specify which groups of people would be deemed ""most vulnerable"". To prevent the stockpiling of free lateral flow tests before 1 April, people will only be able to order a box of tests every three days instead of every 24 hours. Once tests are no longer free, ministers expect a market for lateral flow tests to develop, with individual tests expected to cost a few pounds. The scaling back of testing comes after Mr Johnson previously told the BBCÂ£2bn had been spent on the testing system in January alone. Mr Johnson said ""targeted vaccines and treatments"" would be in place for the most vulnerable, and the government would follow the recommendation of the UK's vaccine advisory body to offer an additional booster jabto the over-75s and the most vulnerable over-12sthis spring. He added the government would maintain its resilience to respond to resurgences from the virus, including by keeping the Office for National Statistics infection surveillance survey to keep track of surges when they happen. Ministers have taken an axe to testing - going further than many experts thought they should. A number had called for rapid lateral flow tests to be made available to older people, and those with health conditions, so they could get family and friends to use them before visiting. Instead, beyond social care staff, only those deemed at-risk will get access to tests in the community - and only then if they have symptoms. The at-risk group has not been defined, but is likely to be the most vulnerable who would benefit from antiviral treatments to reduce the risk of them needing hospital admission. This includes the severely immuno-compromised. A healthy 80-year-old would not qualify. These changes will come in on 1 April and by that stage infection levels could be at very low rates. The scaling back may not seem that significant if that is the case. But the big caveat is that the government will retain the ability to ramp testing back up if the circumstances demand it - either because infection rates take a turn for a worse, or a new variant emerges. Mr Johnson also promised that the UK government would continue to work with the devolved administrations of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland as they decided how to take forward their own plans. But Scottish health secretary Humza Yousaf said free tests and self-isolating when positive with Covid were effective tools in suppressing the virus and said the public health advice the Scottish government had received ""does not advise removing these important interventions at this time"". He called for the UK government to continue supplying ""adequate"" funding for all parts of the UK to do what they deemed necessary to tackle the virus. Northern Ireland's health minister Robin Swann said his department would ""carefully consider"" England's plan, but no decisions had been made on changes to his country's test and trace programme. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer described the PM's plan as a ""half-baked announcement from a government paralysed by chaos and incompetence"". He said the PM's strategy was not ""a plan to live well with Covid"" and would instead ""leave us vulnerable"". Dr Chaand Nagpaul, council chairman of the BMA, said the strategy neglected some of society's most vulnerable and instead of giving people more freedom, it was likely to cause ""more uncertainty and anxiety"". ""Living with Covid-19 must not mean ignoring the virus all together - which in many respects the government's plan in England seems to do,"" he said. Dr Nagpaul called for ""urgent clarity"" on testing for NHS workers to protect staff and patients and that ""protections must be maintained for the most vulnerable, including the provision of enhanced face masks, and clear guidance for both patients and clinicians"". Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers which represents hospital trusts, said many NHS figures were ""concerned about the potential impact of these decisions"" and it was ""vital"" the government was ready to restore phased out testing and surveillance systems should they be needed. Ministers should assess the impact of restricting access to free testing, he said, warning there was a risk of ""significantly exacerbating health inequalities"". The Blood Cancer UK charity accused the government of lifting restrictions ""without a plan to protect immunocompromised people"" and warned the move would leave many of them ""feeling abandoned"". It said that of the 500,000 severely immunocompromised people in the UK, about 230,000 have blood cancer. Plan B measures - introduced in December to stem the spread of the Omicron variant - including the requirement to wear masks in public places and the use of Covid passes for large events, were abolished in England last month. Face masks continue to be a condition of carriage on London's transport network, but London mayor Sadiq Khan said on Monday that he expected the rules would be lifted following the PM's announcement. Just over 91% of people in the UK aged 12 and over have had a first dose of a vaccine, 85% a second jab, and 66% a booster or a third dose,according to official data,external. On Monday, the UK recorded a further 38,409 confirmed daily cases and another 15 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test. An axe has been taken to testing - does it matter?

"Vladimir Putin's decision came shortly before Prime Minister Boris Johnson appeared at a news conference in Downing Street The UK government has promised to sanction Russia over President Vladimir Putin's decision to recognise two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine. Recent legislation will be used to impose restrictions on people and organisations linked to Russia, the BBC understands. Government sources say sanctions would be ""ratcheted up"" in the event of a Russian incursion of Ukraine. The PM is expected to set out further details in the UK Parliament later. Health Secretary Sajid Javid accused Russia of a ""flagrant violation"" of Ukraine's sovereignty, adding it appeared an invasion of the country had already begun. Speaking on BBC Breakfast, he said Europe was waking up to a ""very dark morning"", adding ""we cannot allow this to stand"". He added UK sanctions would be targeted at individuals and companies linked to the Russian government, and Russia's economy. Several of the UK's western allies, the US, France and the European Union, made similar pledges, condemning Mr Putin's move and promising sanctions. Russia recognises Ukraine separatist regions Criss-crossing Ukraine with President Zelensky Satellite images show Russian activity near Ukraine Early on Tuesday morning, Prime Minister Boris Johnson discussed sanctions, as well as the latest intelligence, at a Cobra emergency response meeting of cabinet ministers and officials. Mr Johnson told Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky on Monday evening that he believed an invasion was a real possibility in the coming hours and days, a Downing Street spokesperson said. In a phone call, the PM told Mr Zelensky he would ""explore sending further defensive support to Ukraine"" at the request of the country's government, as well as detailing sanctions. A No 10 spokesperson added: ""The leaders agreed that the West needed to support Ukraine in the event of an invasion, but should continue to pursue a diplomatic solution until the last possible second."" Hours earlier on Monday, Mr Putin signed a decree recognising the independence of the self-declared people's republics of Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine. Russian-backed rebels have been fighting Ukrainian forces in those regions since 2014 in a conflict that has claimed the lives of more than 14,000 people. Mr Putin's decision has been preceded by weeks of tensions and intense diplomacy over a build-up of Russian troops on Ukraine's borders. Pro-Russian activists react in the separatist-controlled city of Donetsk following President Putin's announcement The decree signed by Mr Putin says Russian armed forces will perform ""peacekeeping functions"" in Donetsk and Lugansk. In a lengthy TV address, Mr Putin, appearing visibly angry at points, claimed ""modern Ukraine was entirely created by Russia"" and was part of its ancient lands. But in recent weeks, Russia has repeatedly denied it has plans to invade Ukraine and accused the West of ""hysteria"". Mr Putin delivered the speech as UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson was giving one of his own in Downing Street on measures to lift Covid-19 restrictions. Mr Johnson said Mr Putin's decision to recognise the two separatist Ukrainian regions was ""plainly in breach of international law"" and a ""flagrant violation of the sovereignty and integrity"" of the country. Tap or click to go through the gallery  Mr Johnson said the decision was a ""very ill omen"" that things were moving in the wrong direction in Ukraine. ""The UK will continue to do everything we can to stand by the people of Ukraine with a very robust package of sanctions,"" he said. He said it was becoming clear there was a need to ""start applying as much pressure as we possibly can"" because it was hard to see how the situation would improve. Earlier this month, the UK government passed new legislation that expanded its powers to impose sanctions on those directly linked to Russian actions in Ukraine. The legislation gave the government powers to impose sanctions on Russian businesses and individuals in strategically significant sectors, such as the chemical, defence, extractives, ICT and financial services industries.

"Linda McCall was convicted of attacks on five vulnerable children An inquiry into a case of abuse by a teacher has described the time it took a council to report concerns to a child protection unit as ""reprehensible"". Andrew Webster QC said this should have happened in October 2017 - but did not take place until about a year later. Scottish Borders Council has now issued an apology to parents over the case. Linda McCall, who was initially cleared of wrongdoing, was found guilty last year of assaulting five vulnerable children between 2016 and 2017. An independent inquiry was ordered into the case, andits report has now been made public,external. The families have previously told BBC Scotland of the ""life-changing trauma"" that had been caused by the case. Scottish Borders Council will meet to discuss the findings later this week The inquiry found that the council's procedures meant concerns should have been raised with the child protection unit in October 2017. It added that there were further occasions when they could have been reported, and the council ""compounded its failure"" to act promptly. Mr Webster said the fact that it took until October 2018 for the case to be taken to the child protection unit was ""reprehensible"". He said he could not rule out that the delay had caused ""unnecessary harm"" to children and that it had undoubtedly caused distress for parents. He also criticised the local authority's failure to recognise the significance of the conduct being alleged and deficiencies in its training in the reporting of child protection concerns. The inquiry has made 10 recommendations in light of its findings including: Improving child protection training Reviewing child protection and disciplinary procedures Improving communication with parents The 62-page report says other staff at the primary school where McCall was working as a teacher of complex needs raised concerns about her ""rough treatment"" of children in October 2017. She was moved to another location - away from pupils - and a disciplinary investigation launched which ultimately saw her reassigned to a different place of work. The council did not inform parents about the allegations or the disciplinary process but rumours began to circulate about the reasons for her departure - including the possibility children had been harmed. One parent was advised by a councillor that the rumours were not true but they persisted - leading to media reports of an alleged ""cover-up"" and concerns over the council's ""wall of silence"". It was only after a child protection investigation in late 2018 that the allegations - made about a year earlier - were brought to the attention of the police. One parent told BBC Scotland that the council should have apologised ""a lot sooner"". ""Finally, they are actually realising they have got something to apologise for,"" she added. Another parent shared the frustration about the time it had taken to receive ""a bit of a half-hearted apology"". ""It has just been an exhausting battle,"" she said. ""It feels a little bit better in some ways, but it still doesn't change what happened and that should never have happened. ""There need to be changes that ensure this never ever happens to another child again."" Marina Urie, a senior lawyer with Thompsons Solicitors, said the report ""completely vindicates the families"" and laid bare the council's failings. ""Thanks to the efforts of my clients, hopefully every child under the protection of Borders Council from now on will be looked after properly. ""The council are now subject to civil legal proceedings on behalf of children abused by their employee and we hope to conclude these matters soon."" Council leader Mark Rowley said what had happened was ""shocking and completely unacceptable"". He said he was sorry matters had not been referred to the child protection unit at their earliest opportunity, and for the council's failure to communicate appropriately with parents. ""Most of all, the council apologises wholeheartedly that the incidents of abuse occurred in the first place,"" he said. ""We must now learn from these mistakes and ensure they are never repeated."" Carol Hamilton, executive member for children and young people, said the report made ""very uncomfortable reading"" and the council ""should have done much better"". The council will meet to discuss the inquiry's findings on Friday and look at any changes required as a result of its recommendations.

"Russian forces launch a full-scale assault on Ukraine, with its military attacking the country from the north, east and south Ukrainian President Zelensky says 137 Ukrainian citizens - both soldiers and civilians - died on Thursday People in the capital, Kyiv, and elsewhere are trying to flee - some 100,000 have left so far, the UN says There are also renewed reports of explosions in the port city of Mariupol, home to half a million people Russians seize control of the Chernobyl complex - site of the world's worst nuclear disaster UK and US announce fresh new sanctions on Russia, including asset freezes on banks President Vladimir Putin defends his move, saying there was no other way to defend Russia But US President Joe Biden says Putin's aggression will cost Russia dearly Edited by Jude Sheerin For technical reasons too boring to explain, we are switching our live coverageto a new webpage here. For all the latest developments on the conflict, please follow us to the new link. President Joe Biden and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz have both said that cutting Russia off from the global banking system, Swift, is not being proposed right now. But what would happen if it was? Excluding Russia from Swift would risk severe repercussions for banks that are owed
money  - either now or in the longer term. This is particularly true in Germany, which has deep financial ties with Russia and feels it has done its share of economic sacrifice by suspending certification of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Although being de-Swifted would be disruptive for Russia, there is an alternate system - called CFPS - that Russia set up after it annexed Crimea in 2014. Similarly, China has also set up a secondary system, CIPS. Expelling Russia would probably only push it closer to China and play into the hands of the Xi administration, which is keen to ""de-dollarise"" the world's financial architecture. This would accelerate that trend and ambition. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky reportedly just said ""the enemy has designated me as the target number one, and my family as the target number two"". In a video address carried by Ukrainian media, Zelensky says he is staying in the capital Kyiv's ""government quarters"" and his family is also in Ukraine. He did not provide further details. Zelensky also warns that Ukrainian officials now have ""information that enemy sabotage groups have entered Kyiv"". The president did not elaborate on what those groups might be. More on the situation at Chernobyl tonight: White House press secretary Jen Psaki just told reporters at her daily briefing that there are reports Russian soldiers are holding the staff of the Ukrainian nuclear site hostage. ""We are outraged by credible reports that Russian soldiers are currently holding the staff of the Chernobyl facilities hostage,"" she said. ""This unlawful and dangerous hostage-taking, which could upend the routine civil service efforts required to maintain and protect the nuclear waste facilities, is obviously incredibly alarming and gravely concerning. ""We condemn it and we request their release."" Read more on this here. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson told his government on Thursday evening that Ukrainian soldiers have been putting up a fight, tweets the BBC's political correspondent Iain Watson.

Russian forces have taken control of Chernobyl, site of the 1986 nuclear disaster and a place that remains radioactive to this day - prompting significant concern from international nuclear watchdogs. Prof Claire Corkhill, nuclear materials expert at Sheffield University, told the BBC about the dangers of military clashes taking place near the site. âThis is not a place to have ammunition flying around,"" she said. The Chernobyl site contains several nuclear waste containment facilities - including the ânew safe confinementâ - the protective dome that covers the reactor that was so badly damaged by the infamous 1986 explosion. âThese buildings are designed to keep radioactive materials inside, but theyâre not necessarily armoured; theyâre not designed to operate in a war zone,â she said. Prof Corkhill said that although piercing one of these structures  wouldnât necessarily cause a repeat of the Chernobyl disaster - where plumes of radioactive material dispersed across Europe - it could âset us back 30 years in terms of the work that has been done clearing up the siteâ. It could release and disperse radioactive material in the local area, she said. Chris MorrisBBC Reality Check The Nord Stream 2 pipeline that would bring gas to Germany has shuttered amid the latest fighting There was plenty of criticism that Western sanctions in the days leading up to this invasion did not go far enough, fast enough. These new measures will hit the Russian economy much harder. But there are still potential gaps. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said sanctions against major Russian banks include one of the largest state banks, VTB, which will have all its assets frozen. But another major bank, Sberbank, was not mentioned. And the Ukrainian government wanted more â in particular moves to disconnect Russia from the international payment system known as Swift, which thousands of banks use to exchange information. The US and the UK are in favour of such a move, but some European countries fear it could damage their own banks. Suspending Russia from Swift is still under consideration, but the hesitation is a reminder that in a globalised world all sanctions tend to have an impact on the countries imposing them as well. And the real trouble with sanctions is that they donât work quickly. They do increase pressure, and they can do damage. But the international community is not trying to damage the Russian economy just for the sake of doing so. It wants economic pressure to force a change in Putinâs political and military calculations. Meanwhile, the invasion of Ukraine continues. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has just signed a decree ordering a general mobilisation. All Ukrainians who can carry arms have been urged to defend their homeland. The country's conscripts and reservists are also being called up, according to the decree, which is to be in effect for 90 days. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says 137 Ukrainian citizens - both soldiers and civilians - died on Thursday, the first day of a massive Russian military assault. Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News The head of Britain's MI6 has tweeted about intelligence on Ukraine. âUS and UK
intelligence communities uncovered Putinâs plans for Ukraine. We exposed his
attempts to engineer âfalse flagâ, fake attacks to justify his invasion. We
revealed his plans to assassinate Ukrainian leaders and senior officials,â
Richard Moore, also known as ""C"", said in a tweet. âThis attack was long
planned, unprovoked, cruel aggression. No amount of Russian disinformation will
now disguise that fact from the international community,"" wrote the Secret Intelligence Service chief. US and UK intelligence seem to have had an unusual and highly
accurate level of insight into Putinâs plans and strategy. The unprecedented
publicising of some of that intelligence has had tactical success in partly disrupting Putinâs plans - including for provocations and false flags. It may have also helped draw Western countries closer together. But even this
level of insight couldnât provide a way of stopping or deterring him. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Long queues have been seen at bus and train station in the capital Kyiv, as people have been desperately trying to go western regions of Ukraine All Ukrainian men aged between 18 to 60 are now banned from leaving the country, Ukraine's state border guard service (DPSA) says. It adds the measure is aimed at ""guaranteeing Ukraine's defence and the organisation of timely mobilisation"". The temporary ban will remain in force for the duration of martial law declared on Thursday morning. Steve RosenbergBBC Moscow Correspondent I think Vladimir Putin is fuelled by resentment at how the Cold War ended, with the West declaring victory and Russia losing power, influence and territory. I think he's also motivated by an almost semi-religious belief that Ukraine must be with Russia, must be in Russia's orbit, and Russia as a great power has the right to its own sphere of influence. I also think he has disdain for the West and Western leaders, whom he deems weak and disunited. What can the West do about this? Itâs very difficult to say. I think the Kremlin would've factored in sanctions. The Kremlin will know that the US will not put boots on the ground in Ukraine. The West does not want a war with Russia and Russia knows that. But I would say this. If youâve been in power for 22 years, as Putin has, you start to feel invincible, you start to think you canât put a foot wrong, that youâre Teflon. And that's when mistakes start to creep in. Just from speaking to people on the streets and witnessing the strength of feeling against this offensive, I wonder whether this Russian invasion will turn out to be Putin's fatal error.

beleaguered president, Volodymyr Zelensky, said in his most recent televised
statement. The echoes of Winston
Churchillâs famous 1946 speech in Fulton, Missouri were powerful. âFrom Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the
Adriatic, an iron curtain has descended across the continent,â Churchill told
his audience back then. Todayâs iron curtain has moved eastwards,
meandering from the Gulf of Finland, around Belarus and along Ukraineâs eastern
border and on down to the Black Sea. That, Zelensky says, is where it should stay, with
Ukraine firmly on the west. But that conviction feels like a fragile,
disappearing dream tonight, as Russian armour cuts deep into Ukrainian
territory, with the prospect of worse to come. With savage ferocity, Vladimir Putin has reached
out, grabbed Ukraine by the scruff of the neck and is trying, by force of arms,
to drag this hopeful nation back across the fence. Night has fallen and a curfew is in effect in Kyiv after the first full day of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. If you're just joining us, or catching up on events, here's what's been going on:  If you want more detail, you can read our guide to the conflict, and how it has unfolded today, byclicking here. Ilya BarabanovBBC Russian Service, Kyiv Smoke rises in the background as people walk down a street near the airfield All day long the Russian troops have been trying to take over an airfield at Hostomel, on the northern outskirts of the Ukrainian capital. This airfield is of strategic importance: if captured it could become a springboard for the Russian army into Kyiv. Judging from verified videos, at least two Russian helicopters were shot down over it. Journalists from CNN filmed a group of Russian paratroopers landing there while the Bellingcat investigative website said it had intelligence that 18 war planes with reinforcements were heading towards it from Russia. Later in the evening it became clear that a heavy battle for Hostomel was raging and Ukrainian forces were using both airstrikes and artillery. By 11pm Kyiv time (21:00 GMT) an official statement was released, saying that the airfield was back in the Ukrainian hands. A protester is detained in Saint Petersburg More than 1,700 people have been arrested during anti-war protests across dozens of cities in Russia, an independent monitor reports. More than 900 were arrested in Moscow and over 400 in Saint Petersburg, according to OVD-Info, which tracks arrests at opposition rallies. Thousands gathered near Pushkin Square in central Moscow, while up to 1,000 people gathered in the former imperial capital Saint Petersburg, the AFP news agency reports. Many held Ukrainian flags in Moscow ""No to war"" was spray-painted on the front gate of the Russian parliament's lower house. ""I am in shock. My relatives and loved ones live in Ukraine,"" Anastasia Nestulya, 23, told AFP in Moscow. ""What can I tell them over the phone? You hang in there?"" Navalny (standing) while on trial from prison Jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny - on trial in a Moscow prison -  has accused Vladimir Putin of using the invasion of Ukraine to cover up Russian corruption. In a video published by independent news outlet Dozhd, Navalny is heard expressing his opposition to the invasion of Ukraine. Wearing a prison uniform, he says it would lead to a ""huge number of victims, destroyed futures and the continuation of this line of impoverishment of the citizens of Russia"". This war between Russia and Ukraine was unleashed to cover up the theft from Russian citizens and divert their attention from problems that exist inside the country. Alexei Navalny Navalny has been jailed for over a year on old fraud charges, after surviving a poison attack, which he and the West say was carried out by the Kremlin. He is being tried inside the maximum security prison on new charges that could see his imprisonment extended by a decade. Vladimir Putin has spoken by phone to French President Emmanuel Macron and given him an ""exhaustive"" explanation of the reasons for
Russia's actions in Ukraine, the Kremlin says. Macron requested the call and they agreed to stay in contact, the Kremlin says. In France, the Elysee Palace says Macron spoke first to Ukraine's President Zelensky. He then spoke to President Putin and demanded an end to military operations and warned of massive sanctions. The French president has attempted to avert a Russian invasion in recent weeks, including holding talks
with Putin in the Kremlin. Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva The UN Refugee Agency warned today of a rapidly deteriorating situation in Ukraine as people flee their homes looking for safety. UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, warned ""the humanitarian consequences on civilian populations will be devastating. There are no winners in war but countless lives will be torn apart"". The refugee agency is calling on Ukraineâs neighbours to keep their borders open to those fleeing and says it stands ready to ""support efforts by all to respond to any situation of forced displacement"". Meanwhile, the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Peter Maurer, called on those fighting to respect international law, and to ensure civilians were protected. The UN had already issued a record appeal for funding in 2022 to relieve crises in Syria, Yemen, Afghanistan, and the drought-ridden Sahel region in Africa. A further major conflict and refugee crisis in the middle of Europe could stretch its resources well beyond their limits. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Vladimir Putin's decision came shortly before Prime Minister Boris Johnson appeared at a news conference in Downing Street The UK government has promised to sanction Russia over President Vladimir Putin's decision to recognise two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine. Recent legislation will be used to impose restrictions on people and organisations linked to Russia, the BBC understands. Government sources say sanctions would be ""ratcheted up"" in the event of a Russian incursion of Ukraine. The PM is expected to set out further details in the UK Parliament later. Health Secretary Sajid Javid accused Russia of a ""flagrant violation"" of Ukraine's sovereignty, adding it appeared an invasion of the country had already begun. Speaking on BBC Breakfast, he said Europe was waking up to a ""very dark morning"", adding ""we cannot allow this to stand"". He added UK sanctions would be targeted at individuals and companies linked to the Russian government, and Russia's economy. Several of the UK's western allies, the US, France and the European Union, made similar pledges, condemning Mr Putin's move and promising sanctions. Russia recognises Ukraine separatist regions Criss-crossing Ukraine with President Zelensky Satellite images show Russian activity near Ukraine Early on Tuesday morning, Prime Minister Boris Johnson discussed sanctions, as well as the latest intelligence, at a Cobra emergency response meeting of cabinet ministers and officials. Mr Johnson told Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky on Monday evening that he believed an invasion was a real possibility in the coming hours and days, a Downing Street spokesperson said. In a phone call, the PM told Mr Zelensky he would ""explore sending further defensive support to Ukraine"" at the request of the country's government, as well as detailing sanctions. A No 10 spokesperson added: ""The leaders agreed that the West needed to support Ukraine in the event of an invasion, but should continue to pursue a diplomatic solution until the last possible second."" Hours earlier on Monday, Mr Putin signed a decree recognising the independence of the self-declared people's republics of Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine. Russian-backed rebels have been fighting Ukrainian forces in those regions since 2014 in a conflict that has claimed the lives of more than 14,000 people. Mr Putin's decision has been preceded by weeks of tensions and intense diplomacy over a build-up of Russian troops on Ukraine's borders. Pro-Russian activists react in the separatist-controlled city of Donetsk following President Putin's announcement The decree signed by Mr Putin says Russian armed forces will perform ""peacekeeping functions"" in Donetsk and Lugansk. In a lengthy TV address, Mr Putin, appearing visibly angry at points, claimed ""modern Ukraine was entirely created by Russia"" and was part of its ancient lands. But in recent weeks, Russia has repeatedly denied it has plans to invade Ukraine and accused the West of ""hysteria"". Mr Putin delivered the speech as UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson was giving one of his own in Downing Street on measures to lift Covid-19 restrictions. Mr Johnson said Mr Putin's decision to recognise the two separatist Ukrainian regions was ""plainly in breach of international law"" and a ""flagrant violation of the sovereignty and integrity"" of the country. Tap or click to go through the gallery  Mr Johnson said the decision was a ""very ill omen"" that things were moving in the wrong direction in Ukraine. ""The UK will continue to do everything we can to stand by the people of Ukraine with a very robust package of sanctions,"" he said. He said it was becoming clear there was a need to ""start applying as much pressure as we possibly can"" because it was hard to see how the situation would improve. Earlier this month, the UK government passed new legislation that expanded its powers to impose sanctions on those directly linked to Russian actions in Ukraine. The legislation gave the government powers to impose sanctions on Russian businesses and individuals in strategically significant sectors, such as the chemical, defence, extractives, ICT and financial services industries.

"This video can not be played Black Arrow Space Technologies wants to set up a base in Port Talbot later this year Plans to launch rockets at sea and build satellites that will act as mini-factories form part of a new strategy to boost Wales' space industry. The hope is the sector will bring in Â£2bn a year to the Welsh economy by 2030. British astronaut Tim Peake said he was ""delighted"" by the proposals. But one firm named in the Welsh government's strategy said other similar-sized countries were ""doing an awful lot more, an awful lot quicker"". Peake: What Tim's space flight means for Britain Funding given to Snowdonia rocket launch centre Do more for space sector, ministers told What exactly did Tim Peake do in space? Space has been among the UK's fastest growing sectors in recent years, employing 42,000 people, of whom just 1% are based in Wales. But ministers have claimed the country is well placed to become a ""true haven for space industry innovation"". An astronaut's view of Wales from space They said they wanted to put a particular focus on environmentally-friendly space enterprises. Cardiff firm Space Forge is one example, as later this year it is set to launch an innovative reusable satellite into orbit. This means one that can be sent up, brought down and then sent back up again repeatedly. If successful, this will be the first satellite made entirely in Wales and the company hopes to use those that follow for in-space manufacturing. The seaborne launch vessel that will be based at Port Talbot That means taking advantage of conditions in space such as ultra-low temperatures and lack of gravity to make new materials the company says could help us transition towards a low-carbon future on Earth. Chief executive Joshua Western said the firm hopes to expand from 30 to 100 staff by 2024, describing the new Welsh space strategy as ""an important milestone that will help galvanise the industry"". The infrastructure already in place along the Welsh coastline - such as the military testing range at Aberporth in Ceredigion - was ideally suited to returning the satellites from orbit, he said. Alongside Aberporth, Radnor range in Powys, Pendine in Carmarthenshire and the Llanbedr airfield in Gwynedd - home of Spaceport Snowdonia - will all be involved in testing and evaluating new greener propulsion technologies for launching objects into space, the government's strategy notes. Efforts to coordinate and promote research in the area amongst Welsh universities is also under way - including the use of satellite data to monitor the environment and help with issues such as coal-tip subsidence. Vaughan Gething said the strategy aimed to bring ""well-paid, highly skilled jobs closer to home"" ""We must remember this is all about fixing challenges on Earth,"" explained Alan Davies, development manager for Space Wales, an organisation set up to help deliver the new strategy. ""From communication challenges to environmental ones, these problems can all be improved by the utilisation of space data and resources,"" he said. Economy Minister Vaughan Gething said the strategy also aimed to bring ""well-paid, highly skilled jobs closer to home, spreading prosperity across Wales"". ""This exciting sector opens up a new front in tackling climate change and perfectly aligns with our focus on clean energy and the wider green agenda,"" he said. Smaller nations, such as Wales, are making their mark when it comes to the space sector, according to Dr Bleddyn Bowen from the University of Leicester. ""Unlike 40 years ago, space isn't just for the big countries,"" said the expert in space policy. ""Whether it's making components for satellites or selling services based on the data gathered from them, lots of small economies are doing more and more in space today,"" he said. The Welsh government's proposals have won the backing of astronaut Tim Peake But while the government's strategy reads as ""a very aspirational"" document it lacks any significant funding announcements, he suggested. Meanwhile, Black Arrow Space Technologies - another firm named in the strategy - claimed the Welsh government has been slow off the mark in its support for the sector. The company hopes to set up a base in Port Talbot later in 2022, with the aim of launching payloads of up to 500kg into orbit from a specially designed ship. This will be a totally different approach to any other rocket or satellite launching operation across the UK - which are all land-based. Black Arrow's chief executive, Paul Williams, described Port Talbot as a ""highly optimal"" area - with its deep-water harbour close to the proposed launch site out at sea, manufacturing heritage, skilled workforce and academic links. This video can not be played Tim Peake's family wave as the Soyuz rocket blasts off into space He said he wanted to see Port Talbot developed as a ""space cluster"" for companies in the field - and while welcoming the publication of a new strategy for the wider sector, said he was critical of the time it has taken for ministers to act. ""I've always maintained that Wales has a major part to play in the UK space sector. ""But when we look around at other countries that seem to be doing an awful lot more, an awful lot quicker - it's quite frustrating,"" he said. Paul Williams believes south Wales could become a major player in the space sector However, the government's proposals have won big-name backing in the form of astronaut Tim Peake. ""Space has an ability to inspire and educate future generations, as well as being at the heart of solving some of today's toughest challenges,"" he said. ""Technology and innovation are key to growing our economy with a skilled workforce and I'm delighted to see that Wales is embracing the exciting opportunities that the space sector has to offer."" The UK space sector has previously set a target of achieving a 10% share of the predicted Â£400bn annual global space market in 2030. The Welsh government's ambition is for Wales to achieve a 5% share of the UK's share, which would equate to Â£2bn per year for the Welsh economy.

"President Zelensky drinking tea as he meets Ukrainian soldiers at the frontline in Shyrokyne ""Move quickly, but watch where you put your feet,"" the soldier instructed as we pulled in behind a wall a few hundred metres from the frontline. Beside us, Ukraine's president was already climbing out of his vehicle wearing body armour and a helmet and heading across a strip of wasteland towards the trenches. This week, as western governments escalated their warnings about the threat of all-out war with Russia, Volodymyr Zelensky decided to drop-in on some of the Ukrainian soldiers who could be right in the path of any invasion. The visit was part of the president's own, two-pronged offensive: showing support for his country's troops on the one hand, whilst warning allies in the West that trying to ""appease"" Moscow over Ukraine was dangerous. For two days, we followed Volodymyr Zelensky as he criss-crossed the country. By plane and helicopter, we moved from military drills to the actual conflict line and from land into the Azov Sea as the West pumped up the volume on its war-warnings. Meant to deter Russia, its alarm appears to have been ignored. The idea of Russia bombing Kyiv into submission still seems far-fetched - more damaging to Vladimir Putin than of any possible benefit. But violence in those parts of eastern Ukraine already controlled by Russian-backed forces has suddenly picked-up. Ukrainian soldiers have been fighting Russian-backed rebels in the east of the country since 2014 At the frontline in Shyrokyne, President Zelensky shared tea and chat with soldiers in the shell of someone's ruined house. Once a popular holiday destination, the coastal village has been shattered by eight years of fighting, its streets partly replaced by deep, muddy trenches and abandoned, shrapnel-hit buildings all around. One soldier admitted his parents were worried about the latest spike in tensions and called constantly to check on him. He himself seemed more anxious about meeting the president: on the table, neat plates of cheese and salami sandwiches lay untouched. That day there had been an increase in shelling along what is known as the contact line. At 09:00, up in Luhansk region, a missile smashed through the wall of a kindergarten into the sport and music room. All the signs are that it was fired from territory controlled by Russian-backed forces. Since then, the number of ceasefire violations has climbed. The president's team told me his security detail were not happy about his high-risk travels, but Volodymyr Zelensky insisted on going ahead. A missile smashed through the wall of a kindergarten in Luhansk region on Thursday Outwardly, he managed to project calm, despite the weeks of tensions. But in our snatched conversations, his frustration with Ukraine's allies quickly surfaced. Some countries are clearly pressuring Kyiv to make compromises that it finds impossible, including renouncing its long-held goal of joining Nato. ""We can't close our eyes every day and year and say it's only Russia that doesn't want to see us there,"" Mr Zelensky told me at one point. ""There are also Nato members who support Russia in this."" Just the other day, the German chancellor underlined how Ukraine's membership of Nato should not be an issue as it is ""not on the agenda"" for now. But Moscow is demanding written guarantees that its neighbour will be excluded from the alliance for life. For Kyiv, agreeing to that is impossible. President Zelensky spoke passionately about the price Ukraine has already paid for trying to wrest itself free from Moscow's grasp: more than 14,000 lives lost as well as the Crimean Peninsula and the Donbas. Over two million people have been displaced. Joining Nato was the people's choice, he said, a guarantee of independence whilst living in Moscow's shadow, making it impossible to backtrack. This video can not be played Zelensky asked: Is Ukraine ready to drop Nato ambitions? He echoed all that on Saturday at the Munich Security Conference in a speech that impressed even critics back home. Driving from a section of frontline, jolted from one giant pothole to the next, Mr Zelensky's security adviser told me the very idea of Ukraine reneging on Nato membership was ""capitulation"". But he acknowledged that pressure from some European countries was mounting. ""They think it's like the 1930s in Europe: that if we appease the aggressor with concessions, it will calm down,"" Mykhailo Podoliak warned. ""We have to keep explaining that if you appease someone, it only encourages them. If the problem is about Nato now, it will just be about the EU next or trade. Russia is the problem, not us."" The conflict in eastern Ukraine has resulted in more than 14,000 deaths since 2014 The way Ukraine sees this crisis, it is standing-up to Russia on behalf of the world. A soldier I met described it as defending the ""eastern flank of democracy"". But it wants more help. ""We shouldn't have to beg; this is about your investment in European security,"" Volodymyr Zelensky told the Munich conference crowd, reminding them that Ukraine had acted as a ""shield"" for Europe, ""holding back one of the biggest armies in the world"". PROFILE:The leader who left TV stardom for presidency ON THE GROUND:Watching for an invasion on Ukraine's long border CONTEXT:Is Russia about to invade Ukraine? At the end of our trip, we flew low over the fields in a trio of helicopters to then drive down broken roads towards another stretch of frontline. Avdiivka's loyalties are still daubed onto its lampposts in stripes of blue and yellow like Ukraine's flag. As Volodymyr Zelensky pulled his flak jacket back over his head and set off up the road to greet more soldiers, I stood and read the names of those who have died fighting at the same spot. The youngest soldier carved into the stone was Olesiya. She was 19. Has Putin's war in Ukraine failed?

"Russian forces launch a full-scale assault on Ukraine, with its military attacking the country from the north, east and south Ukrainian President Zelensky says 137 Ukrainian citizens - both soldiers and civilians - died on Thursday People in the capital, Kyiv, and elsewhere are trying to flee - some 100,000 have left so far, the UN says There are also renewed reports of explosions in the port city of Mariupol, home to half a million people Russians seize control of the Chernobyl complex - site of the world's worst nuclear disaster UK and US announce fresh new sanctions on Russia, including asset freezes on banks President Vladimir Putin defends his move, saying there was no other way to defend Russia But US President Joe Biden says Putin's aggression will cost Russia dearly Edited by Jude Sheerin For technical reasons too boring to explain, we are switching our live coverageto a new webpage here. For all the latest developments on the conflict, please follow us to the new link. President Joe Biden and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz have both said that cutting Russia off from the global banking system, Swift, is not being proposed right now. But what would happen if it was? Excluding Russia from Swift would risk severe repercussions for banks that are owed
money  - either now or in the longer term. This is particularly true in Germany, which has deep financial ties with Russia and feels it has done its share of economic sacrifice by suspending certification of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Although being de-Swifted would be disruptive for Russia, there is an alternate system - called CFPS - that Russia set up after it annexed Crimea in 2014. Similarly, China has also set up a secondary system, CIPS. Expelling Russia would probably only push it closer to China and play into the hands of the Xi administration, which is keen to ""de-dollarise"" the world's financial architecture. This would accelerate that trend and ambition. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky reportedly just said ""the enemy has designated me as the target number one, and my family as the target number two"". In a video address carried by Ukrainian media, Zelensky says he is staying in the capital Kyiv's ""government quarters"" and his family is also in Ukraine. He did not provide further details. Zelensky also warns that Ukrainian officials now have ""information that enemy sabotage groups have entered Kyiv"". The president did not elaborate on what those groups might be. More on the situation at Chernobyl tonight: White House press secretary Jen Psaki just told reporters at her daily briefing that there are reports Russian soldiers are holding the staff of the Ukrainian nuclear site hostage. ""We are outraged by credible reports that Russian soldiers are currently holding the staff of the Chernobyl facilities hostage,"" she said. ""This unlawful and dangerous hostage-taking, which could upend the routine civil service efforts required to maintain and protect the nuclear waste facilities, is obviously incredibly alarming and gravely concerning. ""We condemn it and we request their release."" Read more on this here. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson told his government on Thursday evening that Ukrainian soldiers have been putting up a fight, tweets the BBC's political correspondent Iain Watson.

Russian forces have taken control of Chernobyl, site of the 1986 nuclear disaster and a place that remains radioactive to this day - prompting significant concern from international nuclear watchdogs. Prof Claire Corkhill, nuclear materials expert at Sheffield University, told the BBC about the dangers of military clashes taking place near the site. âThis is not a place to have ammunition flying around,"" she said. The Chernobyl site contains several nuclear waste containment facilities - including the ânew safe confinementâ - the protective dome that covers the reactor that was so badly damaged by the infamous 1986 explosion. âThese buildings are designed to keep radioactive materials inside, but theyâre not necessarily armoured; theyâre not designed to operate in a war zone,â she said. Prof Corkhill said that although piercing one of these structures  wouldnât necessarily cause a repeat of the Chernobyl disaster - where plumes of radioactive material dispersed across Europe - it could âset us back 30 years in terms of the work that has been done clearing up the siteâ. It could release and disperse radioactive material in the local area, she said. Chris MorrisBBC Reality Check The Nord Stream 2 pipeline that would bring gas to Germany has shuttered amid the latest fighting There was plenty of criticism that Western sanctions in the days leading up to this invasion did not go far enough, fast enough. These new measures will hit the Russian economy much harder. But there are still potential gaps. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said sanctions against major Russian banks include one of the largest state banks, VTB, which will have all its assets frozen. But another major bank, Sberbank, was not mentioned. And the Ukrainian government wanted more â in particular moves to disconnect Russia from the international payment system known as Swift, which thousands of banks use to exchange information. The US and the UK are in favour of such a move, but some European countries fear it could damage their own banks. Suspending Russia from Swift is still under consideration, but the hesitation is a reminder that in a globalised world all sanctions tend to have an impact on the countries imposing them as well. And the real trouble with sanctions is that they donât work quickly. They do increase pressure, and they can do damage. But the international community is not trying to damage the Russian economy just for the sake of doing so. It wants economic pressure to force a change in Putinâs political and military calculations. Meanwhile, the invasion of Ukraine continues. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has just signed a decree ordering a general mobilisation. All Ukrainians who can carry arms have been urged to defend their homeland. The country's conscripts and reservists are also being called up, according to the decree, which is to be in effect for 90 days. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says 137 Ukrainian citizens - both soldiers and civilians - died on Thursday, the first day of a massive Russian military assault. Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News The head of Britain's MI6 has tweeted about intelligence on Ukraine. âUS and UK
intelligence communities uncovered Putinâs plans for Ukraine. We exposed his
attempts to engineer âfalse flagâ, fake attacks to justify his invasion. We
revealed his plans to assassinate Ukrainian leaders and senior officials,â
Richard Moore, also known as ""C"", said in a tweet. âThis attack was long
planned, unprovoked, cruel aggression. No amount of Russian disinformation will
now disguise that fact from the international community,"" wrote the Secret Intelligence Service chief. US and UK intelligence seem to have had an unusual and highly
accurate level of insight into Putinâs plans and strategy. The unprecedented
publicising of some of that intelligence has had tactical success in partly disrupting Putinâs plans - including for provocations and false flags. It may have also helped draw Western countries closer together. But even this
level of insight couldnât provide a way of stopping or deterring him. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Long queues have been seen at bus and train station in the capital Kyiv, as people have been desperately trying to go western regions of Ukraine All Ukrainian men aged between 18 to 60 are now banned from leaving the country, Ukraine's state border guard service (DPSA) says. It adds the measure is aimed at ""guaranteeing Ukraine's defence and the organisation of timely mobilisation"". The temporary ban will remain in force for the duration of martial law declared on Thursday morning. Steve RosenbergBBC Moscow Correspondent I think Vladimir Putin is fuelled by resentment at how the Cold War ended, with the West declaring victory and Russia losing power, influence and territory. I think he's also motivated by an almost semi-religious belief that Ukraine must be with Russia, must be in Russia's orbit, and Russia as a great power has the right to its own sphere of influence. I also think he has disdain for the West and Western leaders, whom he deems weak and disunited. What can the West do about this? Itâs very difficult to say. I think the Kremlin would've factored in sanctions. The Kremlin will know that the US will not put boots on the ground in Ukraine. The West does not want a war with Russia and Russia knows that. But I would say this. If youâve been in power for 22 years, as Putin has, you start to feel invincible, you start to think you canât put a foot wrong, that youâre Teflon. And that's when mistakes start to creep in. Just from speaking to people on the streets and witnessing the strength of feeling against this offensive, I wonder whether this Russian invasion will turn out to be Putin's fatal error. Countless city residents are hunkered in subways to avoid potential fighting Countless Kyiv residents are sleeping in underground metro stations as midnight approaches in Ukraine. The people - some of whom have brought their pets, extension cords and even air mattresses - are mostly calm, according to one evacuee. The place is ""not too crowded, most people are scrolling their phones, trying to catch the latest news"", says Oksana Potapova. ""We seem settled enough to spend the night here,"" she wrote on Facebook. ""And given the news about heavy fighting near Kyiv, the takeover of Chernobyl power plant, and forecasts of possible attacks on Kyiv, it seems like a good decision."" Paul AdamsBBC diplomatic correspondent A new iron curtain is falling
across Europe. Thatâs what this countryâs
beleaguered president, Volodymyr Zelensky, said in his most recent televised
statement. The echoes of Winston
Churchillâs famous 1946 speech in Fulton, Missouri were powerful. âFrom Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the
Adriatic, an iron curtain has descended across the continent,â Churchill told
his audience back then. Todayâs iron curtain has moved eastwards,
meandering from the Gulf of Finland, around Belarus and along Ukraineâs eastern
border and on down to the Black Sea. That, Zelensky says, is where it should stay, with
Ukraine firmly on the west. But that conviction feels like a fragile,
disappearing dream tonight, as Russian armour cuts deep into Ukrainian
territory, with the prospect of worse to come. With savage ferocity, Vladimir Putin has reached
out, grabbed Ukraine by the scruff of the neck and is trying, by force of arms,
to drag this hopeful nation back across the fence. Night has fallen and a curfew is in effect in Kyiv after the first full day of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. If you're just joining us, or catching up on events, here's what's been going on:  If you want more detail, you can read our guide to the conflict, and how it has unfolded today, byclicking here. Ilya BarabanovBBC Russian Service, Kyiv Smoke rises in the background as people walk down a street near the airfield All day long the Russian troops have been trying to take over an airfield at Hostomel, on the northern outskirts of the Ukrainian capital. This airfield is of strategic importance: if captured it could become a springboard for the Russian army into Kyiv. Judging from verified videos, at least two Russian helicopters were shot down over it. Journalists from CNN filmed a group of Russian paratroopers landing there while the Bellingcat investigative website said it had intelligence that 18 war planes with reinforcements were heading towards it from Russia. Later in the evening it became clear that a heavy battle for Hostomel was raging and Ukrainian forces were using both airstrikes and artillery. By 11pm Kyiv time (21:00 GMT) an official statement was released, saying that the airfield was back in the Ukrainian hands. A protester is detained in Saint Petersburg More than 1,700 people have been arrested during anti-war protests across dozens of cities in Russia, an independent monitor reports. More than 900 were arrested in Moscow and over 400 in Saint Petersburg, according to OVD-Info, which tracks arrests at opposition rallies. Thousands gathered near Pushkin Square in central Moscow, while up to 1,000 people gathered in the former imperial capital Saint Petersburg, the AFP news agency reports. Many held Ukrainian flags in Moscow ""No to war"" was spray-painted on the front gate of the Russian parliament's lower house. ""I am in shock. My relatives and loved ones live in Ukraine,"" Anastasia Nestulya, 23, told AFP in Moscow. ""What can I tell them over the phone? You hang in there?"" Navalny (standing) while on trial from prison Jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny - on trial in a Moscow prison -  has accused Vladimir Putin of using the invasion of Ukraine to cover up Russian corruption. In a video published by independent news outlet Dozhd, Navalny is heard expressing his opposition to the invasion of Ukraine. Wearing a prison uniform, he says it would lead to a ""huge number of victims, destroyed futures and the continuation of this line of impoverishment of the citizens of Russia"". This war between Russia and Ukraine was unleashed to cover up the theft from Russian citizens and divert their attention from problems that exist inside the country. Alexei Navalny Navalny has been jailed for over a year on old fraud charges, after surviving a poison attack, which he and the West say was carried out by the Kremlin. He is being tried inside the maximum security prison on new charges that could see his imprisonment extended by a decade. Vladimir Putin has spoken by phone to French President Emmanuel Macron and given him an ""exhaustive"" explanation of the reasons for
Russia's actions in Ukraine, the Kremlin says. Macron requested the call and they agreed to stay in contact, the Kremlin says. In France, the Elysee Palace says Macron spoke first to Ukraine's President Zelensky. He then spoke to President Putin and demanded an end to military operations and warned of massive sanctions. The French president has attempted to avert a Russian invasion in recent weeks, including holding talks
with Putin in the Kremlin. Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva The UN Refugee Agency warned today of a rapidly deteriorating situation in Ukraine as people flee their homes looking for safety. UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, warned ""the humanitarian consequences on civilian populations will be devastating. There are no winners in war but countless lives will be torn apart"". The refugee agency is calling on Ukraineâs neighbours to keep their borders open to those fleeing and says it stands ready to ""support efforts by all to respond to any situation of forced displacement"". Meanwhile, the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Peter Maurer, called on those fighting to respect international law, and to ensure civilians were protected. The UN had already issued a record appeal for funding in 2022 to relieve crises in Syria, Yemen, Afghanistan, and the drought-ridden Sahel region in Africa. A further major conflict and refugee crisis in the middle of Europe could stretch its resources well beyond their limits. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Vladimir Putin announces that Russia will recognise Donetsk and Luhansk as independent Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered troops into two rebel-held regions in eastern Ukraine, after recognising them as independent states. Russia said the troops have not yet been deployed but will be ""peacekeeping"" in the regions, which it has backed since 2014. The US said calling them peacekeepers was ""nonsense"", and accused Russia of creating a pretext for war. Several countries have announced sanctions in response. Ukraine's president said his country was ""not afraid of anything or anyone"". In a late-night televised address to the nation, President Volodymyr Zelensky called for ""clear and effective actions of support"" from Ukraine's international allies. ""It is very important to see now who our real friend and partner is, and who will continue to scare the Russian Federation with words only,"" he added. Fears over an invasion have been rising in recent months, as Russia has massed some 150,000 troops along Ukraine's borders, according to US estimates. At an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council, US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield dismissed Russia's claims that troops would be taking on a ""peacekeeping"" role, saying: ""We know what they really are."" Recognising Luhansk and Donetsk as independent was part of Russia's bid to create a reason to invade Ukraine, she said. EXPLAINER:What does Putin want? ON THE GROUND:War, sickness and love in rebel-held Ukraine LIVE:Latest updates on Ukraine Russia has been backing a bloody armed rebellion in eastern Ukraine for the past eight years. Some 14,000 people - including many civilians - have died in fighting since then. In recent years,Russian passports have been given out to large numbers of peoplein Donetsk and Luhansk. The rebel-held areas have been evacuating women, children and the elderly to Russia since late last week. In an hour-long address on Monday, Mr Putin said Ukraine was an integral part of his country's history, and described eastern Ukraine as ""ancient Russian lands"". Russia's UN Ambassador Vasily Nebenzya argued for the need to defend the rebel-held areas in eastern Ukraine's Donbas region from what he called Ukrainian aggression. ""Allowing a new bloodbath in the Donbas is something we do not intend to do,"" he said. But Mr Zelensky said Moscow's recognition of the rebel-held regions represented a threat to the security of Ukraine and other European nations. ""If we have a full-scale escalation... our neighbours would be put at risk,"" he said. Western powers have rallied behind Ukraine, promising tough sanctions against Russia if it invades - though it is not yet clear how effective this move could be. The US swiftly condemned Mr Putin's move, and President Joe Biden signed an executive order that prohibits new investment, trade and financing by Americans in the breakaway regions. The White House said the measures were separate to wider Western sanctions which are ready to go ""should Russia further invade Ukraine"". UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Russia had violated Ukrainian sovereignty and ""completely torn up"" international law. He said Mr Putin appeared ""bent on a full-scale invasion"",and promised a ""barrage of sanctions"". German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said he was halting the process of certifying the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline because of Russia's actions.The gas pipeline between Russia and Germanywas completed last September but is not yet operating. Running under the Baltic Sea, it would double Moscow's gas exports to Germany and circumvent Ukraine, which relies on existing pipelines for income. The European Union pledged to ""react with unity, firmness and with determination in solidarity with Ukraine"". Both Mr Scholz and France's President Emmanuel Macron spoke with the Russian leader ahead of his announcement. This speech was Putin the angry, impatient and directly threatening. It felt like Russia's president was getting 20-odd years of hurt off his chest and hitting back. ""You didn't want us to be friends,"" was how he put it to the West, ""but you didn't have to make an enemy of us."" There was a lot we've heard before, repackaged for this moment when he knows he has maximum attention. He's clearly ceding no ground on his key security demands: Nato expansion must be rolled back, and Ukrainian membership is a red line. He complained that Russia's concerns had been ignored as irrelevant for years and accused the West of trying to ""contain"" Russia as a resurgent global force. Mr Putin's focus on Ukraine felt obsessive, like a man who thinks about little else. At times it sounded like a bid to run for president there, it was so detailed. And, of course, there was his re-writing of Ukrainian history, to claim it has never really been a state. In today's context, that had deeply ominous overtones.

"Russian forces launch a full-scale assault on Ukraine, with its military attacking the country from the north, east and south Ukrainian President Zelensky says 137 Ukrainian citizens - both soldiers and civilians - died on Thursday People in the capital, Kyiv, and elsewhere are trying to flee - some 100,000 have left so far, the UN says There are also renewed reports of explosions in the port city of Mariupol, home to half a million people Russians seize control of the Chernobyl complex - site of the world's worst nuclear disaster UK and US announce fresh new sanctions on Russia, including asset freezes on banks President Vladimir Putin defends his move, saying there was no other way to defend Russia But US President Joe Biden says Putin's aggression will cost Russia dearly Edited by Jude Sheerin For technical reasons too boring to explain, we are switching our live coverageto a new webpage here. For all the latest developments on the conflict, please follow us to the new link. President Joe Biden and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz have both said that cutting Russia off from the global banking system, Swift, is not being proposed right now. But what would happen if it was? Excluding Russia from Swift would risk severe repercussions for banks that are owed
money  - either now or in the longer term. This is particularly true in Germany, which has deep financial ties with Russia and feels it has done its share of economic sacrifice by suspending certification of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Although being de-Swifted would be disruptive for Russia, there is an alternate system - called CFPS - that Russia set up after it annexed Crimea in 2014. Similarly, China has also set up a secondary system, CIPS. Expelling Russia would probably only push it closer to China and play into the hands of the Xi administration, which is keen to ""de-dollarise"" the world's financial architecture. This would accelerate that trend and ambition. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky reportedly just said ""the enemy has designated me as the target number one, and my family as the target number two"". In a video address carried by Ukrainian media, Zelensky says he is staying in the capital Kyiv's ""government quarters"" and his family is also in Ukraine. He did not provide further details. Zelensky also warns that Ukrainian officials now have ""information that enemy sabotage groups have entered Kyiv"". The president did not elaborate on what those groups might be. More on the situation at Chernobyl tonight: White House press secretary Jen Psaki just told reporters at her daily briefing that there are reports Russian soldiers are holding the staff of the Ukrainian nuclear site hostage. ""We are outraged by credible reports that Russian soldiers are currently holding the staff of the Chernobyl facilities hostage,"" she said. ""This unlawful and dangerous hostage-taking, which could upend the routine civil service efforts required to maintain and protect the nuclear waste facilities, is obviously incredibly alarming and gravely concerning. ""We condemn it and we request their release."" Read more on this here. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson told his government on Thursday evening that Ukrainian soldiers have been putting up a fight, tweets the BBC's political correspondent Iain Watson.

Russian forces have taken control of Chernobyl, site of the 1986 nuclear disaster and a place that remains radioactive to this day - prompting significant concern from international nuclear watchdogs. Prof Claire Corkhill, nuclear materials expert at Sheffield University, told the BBC about the dangers of military clashes taking place near the site. âThis is not a place to have ammunition flying around,"" she said. The Chernobyl site contains several nuclear waste containment facilities - including the ânew safe confinementâ - the protective dome that covers the reactor that was so badly damaged by the infamous 1986 explosion. âThese buildings are designed to keep radioactive materials inside, but theyâre not necessarily armoured; theyâre not designed to operate in a war zone,â she said. Prof Corkhill said that although piercing one of these structures  wouldnât necessarily cause a repeat of the Chernobyl disaster - where plumes of radioactive material dispersed across Europe - it could âset us back 30 years in terms of the work that has been done clearing up the siteâ. It could release and disperse radioactive material in the local area, she said. Chris MorrisBBC Reality Check The Nord Stream 2 pipeline that would bring gas to Germany has shuttered amid the latest fighting There was plenty of criticism that Western sanctions in the days leading up to this invasion did not go far enough, fast enough. These new measures will hit the Russian economy much harder. But there are still potential gaps. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said sanctions against major Russian banks include one of the largest state banks, VTB, which will have all its assets frozen. But another major bank, Sberbank, was not mentioned. And the Ukrainian government wanted more â in particular moves to disconnect Russia from the international payment system known as Swift, which thousands of banks use to exchange information. The US and the UK are in favour of such a move, but some European countries fear it could damage their own banks. Suspending Russia from Swift is still under consideration, but the hesitation is a reminder that in a globalised world all sanctions tend to have an impact on the countries imposing them as well. And the real trouble with sanctions is that they donât work quickly. They do increase pressure, and they can do damage. But the international community is not trying to damage the Russian economy just for the sake of doing so. It wants economic pressure to force a change in Putinâs political and military calculations. Meanwhile, the invasion of Ukraine continues. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has just signed a decree ordering a general mobilisation. All Ukrainians who can carry arms have been urged to defend their homeland. The country's conscripts and reservists are also being called up, according to the decree, which is to be in effect for 90 days. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says 137 Ukrainian citizens - both soldiers and civilians - died on Thursday, the first day of a massive Russian military assault. Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News The head of Britain's MI6 has tweeted about intelligence on Ukraine. âUS and UK
intelligence communities uncovered Putinâs plans for Ukraine. We exposed his
attempts to engineer âfalse flagâ, fake attacks to justify his invasion. We
revealed his plans to assassinate Ukrainian leaders and senior officials,â
Richard Moore, also known as ""C"", said in a tweet. âThis attack was long
planned, unprovoked, cruel aggression. No amount of Russian disinformation will
now disguise that fact from the international community,"" wrote the Secret Intelligence Service chief. US and UK intelligence seem to have had an unusual and highly
accurate level of insight into Putinâs plans and strategy. The unprecedented
publicising of some of that intelligence has had tactical success in partly disrupting Putinâs plans - including for provocations and false flags. It may have also helped draw Western countries closer together. But even this
level of insight couldnât provide a way of stopping or deterring him. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Long queues have been seen at bus and train station in the capital Kyiv, as people have been desperately trying to go western regions of Ukraine All Ukrainian men aged between 18 to 60 are now banned from leaving the country, Ukraine's state border guard service (DPSA) says. It adds the measure is aimed at ""guaranteeing Ukraine's defence and the organisation of timely mobilisation"". The temporary ban will remain in force for the duration of martial law declared on Thursday morning. Steve RosenbergBBC Moscow Correspondent I think Vladimir Putin is fuelled by resentment at how the Cold War ended, with the West declaring victory and Russia losing power, influence and territory. I think he's also motivated by an almost semi-religious belief that Ukraine must be with Russia, must be in Russia's orbit, and Russia as a great power has the right to its own sphere of influence. I also think he has disdain for the West and Western leaders, whom he deems weak and disunited. What can the West do about this? Itâs very difficult to say. I think the Kremlin would've factored in sanctions. The Kremlin will know that the US will not put boots on the ground in Ukraine. The West does not want a war with Russia and Russia knows that. But I would say this. If youâve been in power for 22 years, as Putin has, you start to feel invincible, you start to think you canât put a foot wrong, that youâre Teflon. And that's when mistakes start to creep in. Just from speaking to people on the streets and witnessing the strength of feeling against this offensive, I wonder whether this Russian invasion will turn out to be Putin's fatal error. Countless city residents are hunkered in subways to avoid potential fighting Countless Kyiv residents are sleeping in underground metro stations as midnight approaches in Ukraine. The people - some of whom have brought their pets, extension cords and even air mattresses - are mostly calm, according to one evacuee. The place is ""not too crowded, most people are scrolling their phones, trying to catch the latest news"", says Oksana Potapova. ""We seem settled enough to spend the night here,"" she wrote on Facebook. ""And given the news about heavy fighting near Kyiv, the takeover of Chernobyl power plant, and forecasts of possible attacks on Kyiv, it seems like a good decision."" Paul AdamsBBC diplomatic correspondent A new iron curtain is falling
across Europe. Thatâs what this countryâs
beleaguered president, Volodymyr Zelensky, said in his most recent televised
statement. The echoes of Winston
Churchillâs famous 1946 speech in Fulton, Missouri were powerful. âFrom Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the
Adriatic, an iron curtain has descended across the continent,â Churchill told
his audience back then. Todayâs iron curtain has moved eastwards,
meandering from the Gulf of Finland, around Belarus and along Ukraineâs eastern
border and on down to the Black Sea. That, Zelensky says, is where it should stay, with
Ukraine firmly on the west. But that conviction feels like a fragile,
disappearing dream tonight, as Russian armour cuts deep into Ukrainian
territory, with the prospect of worse to come. With savage ferocity, Vladimir Putin has reached
out, grabbed Ukraine by the scruff of the neck and is trying, by force of arms,
to drag this hopeful nation back across the fence. Night has fallen and a curfew is in effect in Kyiv after the first full day of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. If you're just joining us, or catching up on events, here's what's been going on:  If you want more detail, you can read our guide to the conflict, and how it has unfolded today, byclicking here. Ilya BarabanovBBC Russian Service, Kyiv Smoke rises in the background as people walk down a street near the airfield All day long the Russian troops have been trying to take over an airfield at Hostomel, on the northern outskirts of the Ukrainian capital. This airfield is of strategic importance: if captured it could become a springboard for the Russian army into Kyiv. Judging from verified videos, at least two Russian helicopters were shot down over it. Journalists from CNN filmed a group of Russian paratroopers landing there while the Bellingcat investigative website said it had intelligence that 18 war planes with reinforcements were heading towards it from Russia. Later in the evening it became clear that a heavy battle for Hostomel was raging and Ukrainian forces were using both airstrikes and artillery. By 11pm Kyiv time (21:00 GMT) an official statement was released, saying that the airfield was back in the Ukrainian hands. A protester is detained in Saint Petersburg More than 1,700 people have been arrested during anti-war protests across dozens of cities in Russia, an independent monitor reports. More than 900 were arrested in Moscow and over 400 in Saint Petersburg, according to OVD-Info, which tracks arrests at opposition rallies. Thousands gathered near Pushkin Square in central Moscow, while up to 1,000 people gathered in the former imperial capital Saint Petersburg, the AFP news agency reports. Many held Ukrainian flags in Moscow ""No to war"" was spray-painted on the front gate of the Russian parliament's lower house. ""I am in shock. My relatives and loved ones live in Ukraine,"" Anastasia Nestulya, 23, told AFP in Moscow. ""What can I tell them over the phone? You hang in there?"" Navalny (standing) while on trial from prison Jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny - on trial in a Moscow prison -  has accused Vladimir Putin of using the invasion of Ukraine to cover up Russian corruption. In a video published by independent news outlet Dozhd, Navalny is heard expressing his opposition to the invasion of Ukraine. Wearing a prison uniform, he says it would lead to a ""huge number of victims, destroyed futures and the continuation of this line of impoverishment of the citizens of Russia"". This war between Russia and Ukraine was unleashed to cover up the theft from Russian citizens and divert their attention from problems that exist inside the country. Alexei Navalny Navalny has been jailed for over a year on old fraud charges, after surviving a poison attack, which he and the West say was carried out by the Kremlin. He is being tried inside the maximum security prison on new charges that could see his imprisonment extended by a decade. Vladimir Putin has spoken by phone to French President Emmanuel Macron and given him an ""exhaustive"" explanation of the reasons for
Russia's actions in Ukraine, the Kremlin says. Macron requested the call and they agreed to stay in contact, the Kremlin says. In France, the Elysee Palace says Macron spoke first to Ukraine's President Zelensky. He then spoke to President Putin and demanded an end to military operations and warned of massive sanctions.

"President Zelensky drinking tea as he meets Ukrainian soldiers at the frontline in Shyrokyne ""Move quickly, but watch where you put your feet,"" the soldier instructed as we pulled in behind a wall a few hundred metres from the frontline. Beside us, Ukraine's president was already climbing out of his vehicle wearing body armour and a helmet and heading across a strip of wasteland towards the trenches. This week, as western governments escalated their warnings about the threat of all-out war with Russia, Volodymyr Zelensky decided to drop-in on some of the Ukrainian soldiers who could be right in the path of any invasion. The visit was part of the president's own, two-pronged offensive: showing support for his country's troops on the one hand, whilst warning allies in the West that trying to ""appease"" Moscow over Ukraine was dangerous. For two days, we followed Volodymyr Zelensky as he criss-crossed the country. By plane and helicopter, we moved from military drills to the actual conflict line and from land into the Azov Sea as the West pumped up the volume on its war-warnings. Meant to deter Russia, its alarm appears to have been ignored. The idea of Russia bombing Kyiv into submission still seems far-fetched - more damaging to Vladimir Putin than of any possible benefit. But violence in those parts of eastern Ukraine already controlled by Russian-backed forces has suddenly picked-up. Ukrainian soldiers have been fighting Russian-backed rebels in the east of the country since 2014 At the frontline in Shyrokyne, President Zelensky shared tea and chat with soldiers in the shell of someone's ruined house. Once a popular holiday destination, the coastal village has been shattered by eight years of fighting, its streets partly replaced by deep, muddy trenches and abandoned, shrapnel-hit buildings all around. One soldier admitted his parents were worried about the latest spike in tensions and called constantly to check on him. He himself seemed more anxious about meeting the president: on the table, neat plates of cheese and salami sandwiches lay untouched. That day there had been an increase in shelling along what is known as the contact line. At 09:00, up in Luhansk region, a missile smashed through the wall of a kindergarten into the sport and music room. All the signs are that it was fired from territory controlled by Russian-backed forces. Since then, the number of ceasefire violations has climbed. The president's team told me his security detail were not happy about his high-risk travels, but Volodymyr Zelensky insisted on going ahead. A missile smashed through the wall of a kindergarten in Luhansk region on Thursday Outwardly, he managed to project calm, despite the weeks of tensions. But in our snatched conversations, his frustration with Ukraine's allies quickly surfaced. Some countries are clearly pressuring Kyiv to make compromises that it finds impossible, including renouncing its long-held goal of joining Nato. ""We can't close our eyes every day and year and say it's only Russia that doesn't want to see us there,"" Mr Zelensky told me at one point. ""There are also Nato members who support Russia in this."" Just the other day, the German chancellor underlined how Ukraine's membership of Nato should not be an issue as it is ""not on the agenda"" for now. But Moscow is demanding written guarantees that its neighbour will be excluded from the alliance for life. For Kyiv, agreeing to that is impossible. President Zelensky spoke passionately about the price Ukraine has already paid for trying to wrest itself free from Moscow's grasp: more than 14,000 lives lost as well as the Crimean Peninsula and the Donbas. Over two million people have been displaced. Joining Nato was the people's choice, he said, a guarantee of independence whilst living in Moscow's shadow, making it impossible to backtrack. This video can not be played Zelensky asked: Is Ukraine ready to drop Nato ambitions? He echoed all that on Saturday at the Munich Security Conference in a speech that impressed even critics back home. Driving from a section of frontline, jolted from one giant pothole to the next, Mr Zelensky's security adviser told me the very idea of Ukraine reneging on Nato membership was ""capitulation"". But he acknowledged that pressure from some European countries was mounting. ""They think it's like the 1930s in Europe: that if we appease the aggressor with concessions, it will calm down,"" Mykhailo Podoliak warned. ""We have to keep explaining that if you appease someone, it only encourages them. If the problem is about Nato now, it will just be about the EU next or trade. Russia is the problem, not us."" The conflict in eastern Ukraine has resulted in more than 14,000 deaths since 2014 The way Ukraine sees this crisis, it is standing-up to Russia on behalf of the world. A soldier I met described it as defending the ""eastern flank of democracy"". But it wants more help. ""We shouldn't have to beg; this is about your investment in European security,"" Volodymyr Zelensky told the Munich conference crowd, reminding them that Ukraine had acted as a ""shield"" for Europe, ""holding back one of the biggest armies in the world"". PROFILE:The leader who left TV stardom for presidency ON THE GROUND:Watching for an invasion on Ukraine's long border CONTEXT:Is Russia about to invade Ukraine? At the end of our trip, we flew low over the fields in a trio of helicopters to then drive down broken roads towards another stretch of frontline. Avdiivka's loyalties are still daubed onto its lampposts in stripes of blue and yellow like Ukraine's flag.

"Russian forces launch a full-scale assault on Ukraine, with its military attacking the country from the north, east and south Ukrainian President Zelensky says 137 Ukrainian citizens - both soldiers and civilians - died on Thursday People in the capital, Kyiv, and elsewhere are trying to flee - some 100,000 have left so far, the UN says There are also renewed reports of explosions in the port city of Mariupol, home to half a million people Russians seize control of the Chernobyl complex - site of the world's worst nuclear disaster UK and US announce fresh new sanctions on Russia, including asset freezes on banks President Vladimir Putin defends his move, saying there was no other way to defend Russia But US President Joe Biden says Putin's aggression will cost Russia dearly Edited by Jude Sheerin For technical reasons too boring to explain, we are switching our live coverageto a new webpage here. For all the latest developments on the conflict, please follow us to the new link. President Joe Biden and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz have both said that cutting Russia off from the global banking system, Swift, is not being proposed right now. But what would happen if it was? Excluding Russia from Swift would risk severe repercussions for banks that are owed
money  - either now or in the longer term. This is particularly true in Germany, which has deep financial ties with Russia and feels it has done its share of economic sacrifice by suspending certification of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Although being de-Swifted would be disruptive for Russia, there is an alternate system - called CFPS - that Russia set up after it annexed Crimea in 2014. Similarly, China has also set up a secondary system, CIPS. Expelling Russia would probably only push it closer to China and play into the hands of the Xi administration, which is keen to ""de-dollarise"" the world's financial architecture. This would accelerate that trend and ambition. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky reportedly just said ""the enemy has designated me as the target number one, and my family as the target number two"". In a video address carried by Ukrainian media, Zelensky says he is staying in the capital Kyiv's ""government quarters"" and his family is also in Ukraine. He did not provide further details. Zelensky also warns that Ukrainian officials now have ""information that enemy sabotage groups have entered Kyiv"". The president did not elaborate on what those groups might be. More on the situation at Chernobyl tonight: White House press secretary Jen Psaki just told reporters at her daily briefing that there are reports Russian soldiers are holding the staff of the Ukrainian nuclear site hostage. ""We are outraged by credible reports that Russian soldiers are currently holding the staff of the Chernobyl facilities hostage,"" she said. ""This unlawful and dangerous hostage-taking, which could upend the routine civil service efforts required to maintain and protect the nuclear waste facilities, is obviously incredibly alarming and gravely concerning. ""We condemn it and we request their release."" Read more on this here. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson told his government on Thursday evening that Ukrainian soldiers have been putting up a fight, tweets the BBC's political correspondent Iain Watson.

Russian forces have taken control of Chernobyl, site of the 1986 nuclear disaster and a place that remains radioactive to this day - prompting significant concern from international nuclear watchdogs. Prof Claire Corkhill, nuclear materials expert at Sheffield University, told the BBC about the dangers of military clashes taking place near the site. âThis is not a place to have ammunition flying around,"" she said. The Chernobyl site contains several nuclear waste containment facilities - including the ânew safe confinementâ - the protective dome that covers the reactor that was so badly damaged by the infamous 1986 explosion. âThese buildings are designed to keep radioactive materials inside, but theyâre not necessarily armoured; theyâre not designed to operate in a war zone,â she said. Prof Corkhill said that although piercing one of these structures  wouldnât necessarily cause a repeat of the Chernobyl disaster - where plumes of radioactive material dispersed across Europe - it could âset us back 30 years in terms of the work that has been done clearing up the siteâ. It could release and disperse radioactive material in the local area, she said. Chris MorrisBBC Reality Check The Nord Stream 2 pipeline that would bring gas to Germany has shuttered amid the latest fighting There was plenty of criticism that Western sanctions in the days leading up to this invasion did not go far enough, fast enough. These new measures will hit the Russian economy much harder. But there are still potential gaps. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said sanctions against major Russian banks include one of the largest state banks, VTB, which will have all its assets frozen. But another major bank, Sberbank, was not mentioned. And the Ukrainian government wanted more â in particular moves to disconnect Russia from the international payment system known as Swift, which thousands of banks use to exchange information. The US and the UK are in favour of such a move, but some European countries fear it could damage their own banks. Suspending Russia from Swift is still under consideration, but the hesitation is a reminder that in a globalised world all sanctions tend to have an impact on the countries imposing them as well. And the real trouble with sanctions is that they donât work quickly. They do increase pressure, and they can do damage. But the international community is not trying to damage the Russian economy just for the sake of doing so. It wants economic pressure to force a change in Putinâs political and military calculations. Meanwhile, the invasion of Ukraine continues. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has just signed a decree ordering a general mobilisation. All Ukrainians who can carry arms have been urged to defend their homeland. The country's conscripts and reservists are also being called up, according to the decree, which is to be in effect for 90 days. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says 137 Ukrainian citizens - both soldiers and civilians - died on Thursday, the first day of a massive Russian military assault. Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News The head of Britain's MI6 has tweeted about intelligence on Ukraine. âUS and UK
intelligence communities uncovered Putinâs plans for Ukraine. We exposed his
attempts to engineer âfalse flagâ, fake attacks to justify his invasion. We
revealed his plans to assassinate Ukrainian leaders and senior officials,â
Richard Moore, also known as ""C"", said in a tweet. âThis attack was long
planned, unprovoked, cruel aggression. No amount of Russian disinformation will
now disguise that fact from the international community,"" wrote the Secret Intelligence Service chief. US and UK intelligence seem to have had an unusual and highly
accurate level of insight into Putinâs plans and strategy. The unprecedented
publicising of some of that intelligence has had tactical success in partly disrupting Putinâs plans - including for provocations and false flags. It may have also helped draw Western countries closer together. But even this
level of insight couldnât provide a way of stopping or deterring him. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Long queues have been seen at bus and train station in the capital Kyiv, as people have been desperately trying to go western regions of Ukraine All Ukrainian men aged between 18 to 60 are now banned from leaving the country, Ukraine's state border guard service (DPSA) says. It adds the measure is aimed at ""guaranteeing Ukraine's defence and the organisation of timely mobilisation"". The temporary ban will remain in force for the duration of martial law declared on Thursday morning. Steve RosenbergBBC Moscow Correspondent I think Vladimir Putin is fuelled by resentment at how the Cold War ended, with the West declaring victory and Russia losing power, influence and territory. I think he's also motivated by an almost semi-religious belief that Ukraine must be with Russia, must be in Russia's orbit, and Russia as a great power has the right to its own sphere of influence. I also think he has disdain for the West and Western leaders, whom he deems weak and disunited. What can the West do about this? Itâs very difficult to say. I think the Kremlin would've factored in sanctions. The Kremlin will know that the US will not put boots on the ground in Ukraine. The West does not want a war with Russia and Russia knows that. But I would say this. If youâve been in power for 22 years, as Putin has, you start to feel invincible, you start to think you canât put a foot wrong, that youâre Teflon. And that's when mistakes start to creep in. Just from speaking to people on the streets and witnessing the strength of feeling against this offensive, I wonder whether this Russian invasion will turn out to be Putin's fatal error. Countless city residents are hunkered in subways to avoid potential fighting Countless Kyiv residents are sleeping in underground metro stations as midnight approaches in Ukraine. The people - some of whom have brought their pets, extension cords and even air mattresses - are mostly calm, according to one evacuee. The place is ""not too crowded, most people are scrolling their phones, trying to catch the latest news"", says Oksana Potapova. ""We seem settled enough to spend the night here,"" she wrote on Facebook. ""And given the news about heavy fighting near Kyiv, the takeover of Chernobyl power plant, and forecasts of possible attacks on Kyiv, it seems like a good decision."" Paul AdamsBBC diplomatic correspondent A new iron curtain is falling
across Europe. Thatâs what this countryâs
beleaguered president, Volodymyr Zelensky, said in his most recent televised
statement. The echoes of Winston
Churchillâs famous 1946 speech in Fulton, Missouri were powerful. âFrom Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the
Adriatic, an iron curtain has descended across the continent,â Churchill told
his audience back then. Todayâs iron curtain has moved eastwards,
meandering from the Gulf of Finland, around Belarus and along Ukraineâs eastern
border and on down to the Black Sea. That, Zelensky says, is where it should stay, with
Ukraine firmly on the west. But that conviction feels like a fragile,
disappearing dream tonight, as Russian armour cuts deep into Ukrainian
territory, with the prospect of worse to come. With savage ferocity, Vladimir Putin has reached
out, grabbed Ukraine by the scruff of the neck and is trying, by force of arms,
to drag this hopeful nation back across the fence. Night has fallen and a curfew is in effect in Kyiv after the first full day of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. If you're just joining us, or catching up on events, here's what's been going on:  If you want more detail, you can read our guide to the conflict, and how it has unfolded today, byclicking here. Ilya BarabanovBBC Russian Service, Kyiv Smoke rises in the background as people walk down a street near the airfield All day long the Russian troops have been trying to take over an airfield at Hostomel, on the northern outskirts of the Ukrainian capital. This airfield is of strategic importance: if captured it could become a springboard for the Russian army into Kyiv. Judging from verified videos, at least two Russian helicopters were shot down over it. Journalists from CNN filmed a group of Russian paratroopers landing there while the Bellingcat investigative website said it had intelligence that 18 war planes with reinforcements were heading towards it from Russia. Later in the evening it became clear that a heavy battle for Hostomel was raging and Ukrainian forces were using both airstrikes and artillery. By 11pm Kyiv time (21:00 GMT) an official statement was released, saying that the airfield was back in the Ukrainian hands. A protester is detained in Saint Petersburg More than 1,700 people have been arrested during anti-war protests across dozens of cities in Russia, an independent monitor reports. More than 900 were arrested in Moscow and over 400 in Saint Petersburg, according to OVD-Info, which tracks arrests at opposition rallies. Thousands gathered near Pushkin Square in central Moscow, while up to 1,000 people gathered in the former imperial capital Saint Petersburg, the AFP news agency reports. Many held Ukrainian flags in Moscow ""No to war"" was spray-painted on the front gate of the Russian parliament's lower house. ""I am in shock. My relatives and loved ones live in Ukraine,"" Anastasia Nestulya, 23, told AFP in Moscow. ""What can I tell them over the phone? You hang in there?"" Navalny (standing) while on trial from prison Jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny - on trial in a Moscow prison -  has accused Vladimir Putin of using the invasion of Ukraine to cover up Russian corruption. In a video published by independent news outlet Dozhd, Navalny is heard expressing his opposition to the invasion of Ukraine. Wearing a prison uniform, he says it would lead to a ""huge number of victims, destroyed futures and the continuation of this line of impoverishment of the citizens of Russia"". This war between Russia and Ukraine was unleashed to cover up the theft from Russian citizens and divert their attention from problems that exist inside the country.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson has announced the end of coronavirus restrictions in England All Covid restrictions will end in England on Thursday and free mass testing will stop from 1 April. The prime minister told MPs the legal duty to isolate for those who tested positive would be dropped as he unveiled his""living with Covid"" plan,external. From 1 April the provision of free testing would be targeted to the most vulnerable, Boris Johnson said. But the British Medical Association, a doctors' union, said the plan failed to protect those most at risk from Covid. And opposition parties said the prime minister's blueprint out of the pandemic had moved too fast, and voiced concern over the scaling back of free testing. The Scottish government said the public health advice it had received did not recommend lifting the restrictions. An axe has been taken to testing - does it matter? What is England's 'Living with Covid' plan? Spring Covid booster for over-75s and high risk Businesses warn against end of free Covid tests Speaking at a Downing Street news conference on Monday evening, Mr Johnson said ""today is not the day we can declare victory over Covid because this virus is not going away"". He described the pandemic as ""two of the darkest, grimmest years in our peacetime history"". However, he said the nation had passed the peak of Omicron, with falling cases and hospital admissions. And he said the country could now complete the ""transition back towards normality"" while retaining contingencies to respond to a Covid resurgence or a new variant. England's chief medical officer Prof Sir Chris Whitty said the ending of virus restrictions was a ""gradual, steady change over a period of time"", adding: ""This is not a sudden 'everything stops'."" He said the number of people being infected with Omicron was still ""very high"". Office for National Statistics (ONS) infection figures last week estimated that one in 20 people in England had Covid. Sir Chris said the public health advice for people with Covid would still be to self-isolate to prevent others catching it, as it would be for many other highly infectious diseases. Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK government's chief scientific adviser, warned the virus would continue to evolve over the next couple of years and there was no guarantee that future variants would be less severe than Omicron. He argued it was crucial the nation retained a virus surveillance system to monitor new threats and the capacity to ""ramp up"" measures again quickly to protect the vulnerable. From 21 February: the government is dropping guidance for staff and students in most education and childcare settings to undertake twice weekly asymptomatic testing From Thursday 24 February: People who test positive for Covid will no longer be legally required to self-isolate But they will still be advised to stay at home and avoid contact with others for at least five full days Routine contact tracing will end, so fully-vaccinated close contacts and those under 18 will no longer be legally required to test daily for seven days The Â£500 self-isolation support payment for people on low incomes who test positive for Covid will no longer be available Covid provisions for increased statutory sick pay will apply for a further month From 1 April: Free mass symptomatic and asymptomatic testing for the general public will end, and will instead be targeted towards the most vulnerable People with Covid symptoms will be asked to exercise personal responsibility when deciding whether to stay at home - until then they are still advised to do so Current government guidance on Covid passports will end and it will no longer recommend venues use the NHS Covid pass You can read more about the changes here Earlier, Mr Johnson told MPs it was time to move from government restrictions to people exercising personal responsibility. It was only because levels of immunity were so high and deaths were now ""below where you would normally expect for this time of year"" that the government could lift the restrictions, he said. As Omicron was less severe, testing for it ""on the colossal scale we've been doing"" was less important and less valuable in preventing serious illness, he added. Limited free lateral flow tests for the most vulnerable groups would still be provided, the PM said, and ministers would work with retailers to ensure everyone who wanted a test could buy one. The PM did not specify which groups of people would be deemed ""most vulnerable"". To prevent the stockpiling of free lateral flow tests before 1 April, people will only be able to order a box of tests every three days instead of every 24 hours. Once tests are no longer free, ministers expect a market for lateral flow tests to develop, with individual tests expected to cost a few pounds. The scaling back of testing comes after Mr Johnson previously told the BBCÂ£2bn had been spent on the testing system in January alone. Mr Johnson said ""targeted vaccines and treatments"" would be in place for the most vulnerable, and the government would follow the recommendation of the UK's vaccine advisory body to offer an additional booster jabto the over-75s and the most vulnerable over-12sthis spring. He added the government would maintain its resilience to respond to resurgences from the virus, including by keeping the Office for National Statistics infection surveillance survey to keep track of surges when they happen. Ministers have taken an axe to testing - going further than many experts thought they should. A number had called for rapid lateral flow tests to be made available to older people, and those with health conditions, so they could get family and friends to use them before visiting. Instead, beyond social care staff, only those deemed at-risk will get access to tests in the community - and only then if they have symptoms. The at-risk group has not been defined, but is likely to be the most vulnerable who would benefit from antiviral treatments to reduce the risk of them needing hospital admission. This includes the severely immuno-compromised. A healthy 80-year-old would not qualify. These changes will come in on 1 April and by that stage infection levels could be at very low rates. The scaling back may not seem that significant if that is the case. But the big caveat is that the government will retain the ability to ramp testing back up if the circumstances demand it - either because infection rates take a turn for a worse, or a new variant emerges. Mr Johnson also promised that the UK government would continue to work with the devolved administrations of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland as they decided how to take forward their own plans. But Scottish health secretary Humza Yousaf said free tests and self-isolating when positive with Covid were effective tools in suppressing the virus and said the public health advice the Scottish government had received ""does not advise removing these important interventions at this time"". He called for the UK government to continue supplying ""adequate"" funding for all parts of the UK to do what they deemed necessary to tackle the virus. Northern Ireland's health minister Robin Swann said his department would ""carefully consider"" England's plan, but no decisions had been made on changes to his country's test and trace programme. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer described the PM's plan as a ""half-baked announcement from a government paralysed by chaos and incompetence"". He said the PM's strategy was not ""a plan to live well with Covid"" and would instead ""leave us vulnerable"". Dr Chaand Nagpaul, council chairman of the BMA, said the strategy neglected some of society's most vulnerable and instead of giving people more freedom, it was likely to cause ""more uncertainty and anxiety"". ""Living with Covid-19 must not mean ignoring the virus all together - which in many respects the government's plan in England seems to do,"" he said. Dr Nagpaul called for ""urgent clarity"" on testing for NHS workers to protect staff and patients and that ""protections must be maintained for the most vulnerable, including the provision of enhanced face masks, and clear guidance for both patients and clinicians"". Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers which represents hospital trusts, said many NHS figures were ""concerned about the potential impact of these decisions"" and it was ""vital"" the government was ready to restore phased out testing and surveillance systems should they be needed. Ministers should assess the impact of restricting access to free testing, he said, warning there was a risk of ""significantly exacerbating health inequalities"". The Blood Cancer UK charity accused the government of lifting restrictions ""without a plan to protect immunocompromised people"" and warned the move would leave many of them ""feeling abandoned"". It said that of the 500,000 severely immunocompromised people in the UK, about 230,000 have blood cancer. Plan B measures - introduced in December to stem the spread of the Omicron variant - including the requirement to wear masks in public places and the use of Covid passes for large events, were abolished in England last month. Face masks continue to be a condition of carriage on London's transport network, but London mayor Sadiq Khan said on Monday that he expected the rules would be lifted following the PM's announcement. Just over 91% of people in the UK aged 12 and over have had a first dose of a vaccine, 85% a second jab, and 66% a booster or a third dose,according to official data,external. On Monday, the UK recorded a further 38,409 confirmed daily cases and another 15 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test. An axe has been taken to testing - does it matter?

Russia said the troops have not yet been deployed but will be ""peacekeeping"" in the regions, which it has backed since 2014. The US said calling them peacekeepers was ""nonsense"", and accused Russia of creating a pretext for war. Several countries have announced sanctions in response. Ukraine's president said his country was ""not afraid of anything or anyone"". In a late-night televised address to the nation, President Volodymyr Zelensky called for ""clear and effective actions of support"" from Ukraine's international allies. ""It is very important to see now who our real friend and partner is, and who will continue to scare the Russian Federation with words only,"" he added. Fears over an invasion have been rising in recent months, as Russia has massed some 150,000 troops along Ukraine's borders, according to US estimates. At an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council, US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield dismissed Russia's claims that troops would be taking on a ""peacekeeping"" role, saying: ""We know what they really are."" Recognising Luhansk and Donetsk as independent was part of Russia's bid to create a reason to invade Ukraine, she said. EXPLAINER:What does Putin want? ON THE GROUND:War, sickness and love in rebel-held Ukraine LIVE:Latest updates on Ukraine Russia has been backing a bloody armed rebellion in eastern Ukraine for the past eight years. Some 14,000 people - including many civilians - have died in fighting since then. In recent years,Russian passports have been given out to large numbers of peoplein Donetsk and Luhansk. The rebel-held areas have been evacuating women, children and the elderly to Russia since late last week. In an hour-long address on Monday, Mr Putin said Ukraine was an integral part of his country's history, and described eastern Ukraine as ""ancient Russian lands"". Russia's UN Ambassador Vasily Nebenzya argued for the need to defend the rebel-held areas in eastern Ukraine's Donbas region from what he called Ukrainian aggression. ""Allowing a new bloodbath in the Donbas is something we do not intend to do,"" he said. But Mr Zelensky said Moscow's recognition of the rebel-held regions represented a threat to the security of Ukraine and other European nations. ""If we have a full-scale escalation... our neighbours would be put at risk,"" he said. Western powers have rallied behind Ukraine, promising tough sanctions against Russia if it invades - though it is not yet clear how effective this move could be. The US swiftly condemned Mr Putin's move, and President Joe Biden signed an executive order that prohibits new investment, trade and financing by Americans in the breakaway regions. The White House said the measures were separate to wider Western sanctions which are ready to go ""should Russia further invade Ukraine"". UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Russia had violated Ukrainian sovereignty and ""completely torn up"" international law. He said Mr Putin appeared ""bent on a full-scale invasion"",and promised a ""barrage of sanctions"". German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said he was halting the process of certifying the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline because of Russia's actions.The gas pipeline between Russia and Germanywas completed last September but is not yet operating. Running under the Baltic Sea, it would double Moscow's gas exports to Germany and circumvent Ukraine, which relies on existing pipelines for income. The European Union pledged to ""react with unity, firmness and with determination in solidarity with Ukraine"". Both Mr Scholz and France's President Emmanuel Macron spoke with the Russian leader ahead of his announcement. This speech was Putin the angry, impatient and directly threatening. It felt like Russia's president was getting 20-odd years of hurt off his chest and hitting back. ""You didn't want us to be friends,"" was how he put it to the West, ""but you didn't have to make an enemy of us."" There was a lot we've heard before, repackaged for this moment when he knows he has maximum attention. He's clearly ceding no ground on his key security demands: Nato expansion must be rolled back, and Ukrainian membership is a red line. He complained that Russia's concerns had been ignored as irrelevant for years and accused the West of trying to ""contain"" Russia as a resurgent global force. Mr Putin's focus on Ukraine felt obsessive, like a man who thinks about little else. At times it sounded like a bid to run for president there, it was so detailed. And, of course, there was his re-writing of Ukrainian history, to claim it has never really been a state. In today's context, that had deeply ominous overtones.

Two officials appeared to reference a possibility to ""incorporate"" the regions into Russia. On both occasions, Mr Putin corrected them.

"Two reviews have been commissioned into Arthur Labinjo-Hughes' death, with the local inquiry's findings published on Monday Vulnerable children living where schoolboy Arthur Labinjo-Hughes was tortured and killed have to wait too long for help, a report has found. Arthur, six, died in June 2020 following a campaign of violence by his father and stepmother. A probe of services in Solihull has since uncovered a ""significant"" number of children who remain in ""unknown risk"" due to assessment delays. Solihull Council said it had already begun improvement work. The report,external, published on Monday, found ""too many children in Solihull face drift and delay"" under the support framework delivered by multiple local agencies. Watchdogs said provision was ""under-resourced"" and showed a lack of ""clear understanding"" of the experiences of ""children and their families that need help and protection"". In December, Emma Tustin wasjailed for at least 29 years for Arthur's murderwhile her partner, Arthur's father Thomas Hughes, was given a 21-year sentence for manslaughter. Emma Tustin took a photo of Arthur as he lay dying and sent the image to Thomas Hughes The pair's trial heard Arthur had been poisoned with salt by Tustin and subjected to regular beatings by both adults. He was also given punishments such as being denied food and drink and being made to stand for hours alone in a hallway. Tustin delivered a fatal head injury to Arthur while in her sole care. During the trial, it emerged social workers from Solihull Council had visited the boy's home in the months before he died and found no issues, despite relatives raising concerns. A national inquiry commissioned after the pair's sentencing is to focus on the precise circumstances of the case. In the meantime, a Joint Targeted Area Inspection (JTAI) last month probed how local agencies worked together to help children. The JTAI found Solihull's Local Safeguarding Children Partnership had experienced frequent changes of personnel which ""resulted in a loss of knowledge and experience"". It warned long-standing issues in ensuring there were enough social workers had been compounded by Arthur's death, making those in the profession ""highly reluctant to work in Solihull"". Additionally, inspectors were ""concerned"" about record-keeping flaws within the police system, including multiple records for the same person, and children not linked on the system to their parents, carers, siblings, and those who may pose a risk. Inspectors identified one case of a child who was not linked to her father who had a criminal record, meaning an incident of domestic abuse to which the child was exposed did not appear on her file. The report also found health workers did not have access to each other's records. Learning from significant incidents was not shared effectively either, it added, although steps had been developed following Arthur's death, it said, including guidance on bruising to children. Arthur had more than 130 bruises when he died. Analysis by Alison Holt - Social Affairs editor Too many children experience ""drift and delay"" in having their needs, and risks they may face, assessed in Solihull. It's a stark conclusion from the inspectors as they try to provide context to why concerns raised about Arthur Labinjo-Hughes didn't lead to more action. Knowing when to step in to protect a child is an incredibly tough judgment call. Information is almost inevitably patchy, but the inspectors describe the front door of Solihull's child protection services as significantly under resourced. It points to immense pressure to meet daily demand, not enough social workers and long-term systemic issues, including delays in getting early support to those who need it. Such pressures are not unusual. Many children's services teams in England say they are dealing with growing need and struggling to recruit staff. Years of squeezed council budgets mean there have been significant cuts to the early intervention services which might head off later problems. There is a government review into the whole system currently under way, and many will argue that these deep-rooted problems have to be addressed if children are to be better protected. Inspectors said Solihull Council should prepare a written statement of proposed action by 30 May. A raft of measures were suggested by inspectors. Steps, they said, should include addressing the ""timeliness and quality"" of initial decisions relating to concerns raised about children, and boosting consistency in recording children's voices across all agencies' records. The local authority said it had already launched an Improvement Board and recruited an independent chair to work on upgrading safeguarding in the borough. Council leader Ian Courts, Conservative, said the new improvement board would ""support, oversee, and importantly challenge"" organisations with responsibility for safeguarding children. Opposition councillor Marcus Brain, Green, said: ""A lot of this seems to come down to quite fundamental systemic failures across the various multi-agencies."" National inquiry into boy's death A life cut short by cruelty Arthur had more than 130 bruises when he died In a joint statement, the Minister for Children and Families Will Quince, the Minister for Care Gillian Keegan, and Minister for Safeguarding Rachel Maclean, said: ""Arthur's death was horrific and deeply disturbing. ""The two individuals responsible are in prison - but we must do everything we can to prevent any more cases like this. His death serves as a daily reminder of the urgent need for all the agencies tasked with protecting vulnerable children to work together."" They said police, health and children's services had an ""equal duty"" and they would be writing to all three about their expectation the agencies would provide a statement of intent. Arthur had lived with his mother Olivia Labinjo-Halcrow until 2019 Arthur had lived with his mother Olivia Labinjo-Halcrow after she and Hughes split up not long before the boy's second birthday. In 2019, after she was jailed for the manslaughter of her partner Gary Cunningham, Arthur was left in the sole care of his father.

"At a news conference, Boris Johnson says he is not declaring victory over Covid, after announcing end to all restrictions in England He defends scrapping free tests from 1 April, saying vulnerable people will continue to have access to them The budget for the testing programme was bigger than that of the Home Office last year, he adds From Thursday, people with a positive test will no longer need to self-isolate but will still be advised to stay at home Other nations have different rules: N Ireland has scrapped all restrictions, Wales is at alert level zero, and Scotland has eased rules but some remain England's Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty says the number of people in hospital with Covid - more than 11,000 in the UK - remains significant but is falling Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says that it looks like, for Johnson, living with Covid ""means ignoring it"" People most vulnerable to Covid will be offered an additional booster vaccine from the spring Edited by Owen Amos That brings to an end our rolling coverage of today's Covid news. You can read our main story on the end of legal restrictions in England on Thursday - and the end of free mass testing in April -here. Todayâs live page was written by Becky Morton, Joshua Nevett, Doug Faulkner, Justin Parkinson and Lauren Turner. It was edited by Claire Heald, Owen Amos and Kevin Ponniah. Many thanks for reading. Boris Johnson, Sir Patrick Vallance, and Sir Chris Whitty spent almost an hour giving statements and answering questions. Here are the main points: Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent Compared to previous variants, Omicron hasn't proved deadly for as many people. And testing is hugely expensive. Governments all over the world will have to take this decision at some point. But make no mistake - this is going down very well with Boris Johnson's backbenchers, at just the point that they hold his fate in their hands like never before. The leading voice in the Covid Recovery Group of Conservative MPs Mark Harper joked that it sounded like the PM was joining their number - a collection of backbenchers sceptical about some of the restrictions. It far from guarantees Boris Johnson's survival when the partygate rows flare up again. But it won't do him any harm. The scientists are asked whether there is a danger of giving the public mixed messages by ending self-isolation and universal free Covid testing. Prof Whitty says public health messaging is much more difficult when there is a ""transition"" but we have to accept we need to ""change the way we think about things"". He stresses that mandation is an issue for politicians and separate to public health advice. And with that final question the news conference ends - and Johnson says he is off to speak to the president of Ukraine about the ongoing crisis. The prime minister is asked whether scrapping universal free tests will add to the cost of living crisis. In response, Johnson says the change to the testing regime won't come through for a few weeks, by which point the government hopes and expects incidence of Covid will have further declined, so the impact on people will be minimal. He adds that having a strong economy is the ""single best protection"" against the cost of living crisis - and this would not have been possible if the government hadn't opened up the economy last summer. Asked whether it is hypocritical for him to ask people to take personal responsibility when he is under police investigation for breaking lockdown rules, Johnson says he cannot comment on these allegations. When asked if it's worth continuing to take regular Covid tests, Prof Whitty outlines three situations in which it might be sensible. The first, he says, is ""how common is Covid at the moment"". ""If itâs very high, absolutely, that increases probability,"" Whitty says. The second factor is the ""environment you're in"". ""If youâre in a crowded environment, absolutely,"" he says. And a test would be necessary before ""mixing with vulnerable people"", Whitty says. ""This is about minimising the risk to other people,"" he says.  This video can not be played Boris Johnson hails 'moment of pride for our nation'  This video can not be played Covid: Chris Whitty urges people to continue to self-isolate if positive Boris Johnson is asked what his message is to those who are reluctant to return to their workplace. He says he has always been a believer in the importance of people getting into work, particularly for younger people. ""I would encourage people to get back to work with confidence,"" he says. The scientists are asked whether they are more anxious than confident about restrictions being dropped. Sir Chris Whitty says he is neither anxious nor confident but instead hopes ""we can go steadily in the right direction"". Sir Patrick Vallance adds: ""The one thing this virus has taught you is not to be cocky"" - saying the country needs to go carefully and be ready to react. The prime minister says people shouldn't think there's a ""division between gung-ho politicians and cautious, anxious scientists"". He adds that Covid has not gone away and there will likely be another variant ""that will cause us trouble"" - although he says vaccines and therapeutics put us in a better position to tackle this. Next, ITV Newsâs political editor Robert Peston asks a question about the end of Covid isolation. Peston asks Johnson if he would voluntarily quarantine if he tested positive for the virus after the requirement to self-isolate is lifted after 1 April. The PM says he will âexercise restraint and responsibilityâ to avoid infecting other people. Now onto questions from journalists. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg asks about ending mass testing - and whether the other UK nations will have to follow England's lead. Boris Johnson says ending testing in April can only be done because of the high levels of immunity and relative weakness of Omicron - but says that the government will make sure vulnerable people continue to have access to free tests. He says that we will continue to invest in surveillance, pointing to the ONS survey which will keep going. ""We want to have the keenest eyes in the crow's nest to watch for an iceberg in the form of a new variant,"" he says. Prof Chris Whitty says there are three reasons for testing - surveillance, to guide clinical treatment and for control - the last of which is what is being scaled back. Johnson is also asked about Russian President Vladimir Putin recognising breakaway republics in Ukraine and describes it as a ""dark omen"". You can read our live coverage on the ongoing crisishere. Gemma, from Greater London, asks what the advice is for pregnant women like herself and other people who are more vulnerable to Covid. Have they effectively been told to stay inside? she asks. No, is Boris Johnson's response - but he says everybody who is vulnerable should be treated with the ""utmost consideration"". ""If weâre symptomatic with any disease you should treat vulnerable people with courtesy and avoid spreading it,"" he says. Clinically vulnerable people will also continue to have access to tests and any therapeutics they need, the prime minister says. Sir Chris Whitty adds that it is now really clear that vaccination in pregnancy is a very
good thing for both the mother and her baby - and he urges pregnant women to get vaccinated. Now to the Q&A session, beginning with members of the public. First to ask a question is Nicole from the West Midlands. She says it appears that hospitalisations are at a similar level to that seen in October last year. âShould we put in place more measures to protect NHS?â she asks. Johnson is first to reply. The big difference between then and now is the number of hospitalisations is on a ""clear downward trend,"" he says. ""Youâll have seen the fatality numbers, which are different to what weâve seen in previous waves."" He says high level of vaccine immunity has allowed the restrictions to be lifted. Urging the public to continue to be cautious, Sir Patrick finishes by quoting an American colleague, who says: ""You can celebrate when the sun's shining - but take your umbrella with you."" Sir Patrick says it is absolutely essential to have a good surveillance system to detect new variants. The second thing that is important is to be able to respond quickly, he says, pointing at how quickly Omicron took off. He says it is important to be able to ramp up systems to respond quickly to new threats. There is also a section of the population which is vulnerable at all itimes, he adds, and says it is important to protect them. ""Detect, respond and protect the most vulnerable is absolutely crucial during a period of reducing the measures that are in place,"" he says. Sir Patrick Vallance begins to speak - he says the virus will continue to evolve quite quickly, probably for the next couple of years. And there is no guarantee that the next variant will be of the same reduced severity as Omicron, he says. We expect there to be further variants and they could be more severe, he adds. Prof Whitty says that excess mortality is actually lower than you might expect on average at this time of year, compared with the years before the pandemic. He says the impact on overall mortality has been ""much more muted"" and is ""essentially not visible"" compared to the previous waves of coronavirus. But he says the Omicron wave is still high, with some places in the UK having one in 20 to one in 25 people having the infection, according to ONS data. On the changes to the rules, Whitty says this is a steady move over a period of time as the rates are going down. ""This is not a sudden everything stops,"" he says. Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent There are two big reasons why the government has decided to act now in getting rid of the remaining coronavirus laws in England. The first is the current picture: Omicron has proved to be very mild in terms of the number of people it is killing. To use the technical term, there haven't been any excess deaths as a result of it, or, as Prof Chris Whitty has just put it, ""the total number of deaths is slightly lower than the seasonal average at this time of year"". The second is cost: the prime minister has said the test, trace and isolation budget in the 2020/21 financial year exceeded the entire budget of the Home Office. It has cost a further Â£15.7bn in this financial year - from last April until now - and a another Â£2bn in January of this year alone. England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, is now taking us through the latest data. He says the number of people in hospital with Covid in the UK is ""still significant"" and this is still putting quite a lot of pressure on many hospitals. However, he says the rates ""have been going down steadily now for some
weeks"". Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.99213773
"This video can not be played Boris Johnson has announced the end of coronavirus restrictions in England All Covid restrictions will end in England on Thursday and free mass testing will stop from 1 April. The prime minister told MPs the legal duty to isolate for those who tested positive would be dropped as he unveiled his""living with Covid"" plan,external. From 1 April the provision of free testing would be targeted to the most vulnerable, Boris Johnson said. But the British Medical Association, a doctors' union, said the plan failed to protect those most at risk from Covid. And opposition parties said the prime minister's blueprint out of the pandemic had moved too fast, and voiced concern over the scaling back of free testing. The Scottish government said the public health advice it had received did not recommend lifting the restrictions. An axe has been taken to testing - does it matter? What is England's 'Living with Covid' plan? Spring Covid booster for over-75s and high risk Businesses warn against end of free Covid tests Speaking at a Downing Street news conference on Monday evening, Mr Johnson said ""today is not the day we can declare victory over Covid because this virus is not going away"". He described the pandemic as ""two of the darkest, grimmest years in our peacetime history"". However, he said the nation had passed the peak of Omicron, with falling cases and hospital admissions. And he said the country could now complete the ""transition back towards normality"" while retaining contingencies to respond to a Covid resurgence or a new variant. England's chief medical officer Prof Sir Chris Whitty said the ending of virus restrictions was a ""gradual, steady change over a period of time"", adding: ""This is not a sudden 'everything stops'."" He said the number of people being infected with Omicron was still ""very high"". Office for National Statistics (ONS) infection figures last week estimated that one in 20 people in England had Covid. Sir Chris said the public health advice for people with Covid would still be to self-isolate to prevent others catching it, as it would be for many other highly infectious diseases. Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK government's chief scientific adviser, warned the virus would continue to evolve over the next couple of years and there was no guarantee that future variants would be less severe than Omicron. He argued it was crucial the nation retained a virus surveillance system to monitor new threats and the capacity to ""ramp up"" measures again quickly to protect the vulnerable. From 21 February: the government is dropping guidance for staff and students in most education and childcare settings to undertake twice weekly asymptomatic testing From Thursday 24 February: People who test positive for Covid will no longer be legally required to self-isolate But they will still be advised to stay at home and avoid contact with others for at least five full days Routine contact tracing will end, so fully-vaccinated close contacts and those under 18 will no longer be legally required to test daily for seven days The Â£500 self-isolation support payment for people on low incomes who test positive for Covid will no longer be available Covid provisions for increased statutory sick pay will apply for a further month From 1 April: Free mass symptomatic and asymptomatic testing for the general public will end, and will instead be targeted towards the most vulnerable People with Covid symptoms will be asked to exercise personal responsibility when deciding whether to stay at home - until then they are still advised to do so Current government guidance on Covid passports will end and it will no longer recommend venues use the NHS Covid pass You can read more about the changes here Earlier, Mr Johnson told MPs it was time to move from government restrictions to people exercising personal responsibility. It was only because levels of immunity were so high and deaths were now ""below where you would normally expect for this time of year"" that the government could lift the restrictions, he said. As Omicron was less severe, testing for it ""on the colossal scale we've been doing"" was less important and less valuable in preventing serious illness, he added. Limited free lateral flow tests for the most vulnerable groups would still be provided, the PM said, and ministers would work with retailers to ensure everyone who wanted a test could buy one. The PM did not specify which groups of people would be deemed ""most vulnerable"". To prevent the stockpiling of free lateral flow tests before 1 April, people will only be able to order a box of tests every three days instead of every 24 hours. Once tests are no longer free, ministers expect a market for lateral flow tests to develop, with individual tests expected to cost a few pounds. The scaling back of testing comes after Mr Johnson previously told the BBCÂ£2bn had been spent on the testing system in January alone. Mr Johnson said ""targeted vaccines and treatments"" would be in place for the most vulnerable, and the government would follow the recommendation of the UK's vaccine advisory body to offer an additional booster jabto the over-75s and the most vulnerable over-12sthis spring. He added the government would maintain its resilience to respond to resurgences from the virus, including by keeping the Office for National Statistics infection surveillance survey to keep track of surges when they happen. Ministers have taken an axe to testing - going further than many experts thought they should. A number had called for rapid lateral flow tests to be made available to older people, and those with health conditions, so they could get family and friends to use them before visiting. Instead, beyond social care staff, only those deemed at-risk will get access to tests in the community - and only then if they have symptoms. The at-risk group has not been defined, but is likely to be the most vulnerable who would benefit from antiviral treatments to reduce the risk of them needing hospital admission. This includes the severely immuno-compromised. A healthy 80-year-old would not qualify. These changes will come in on 1 April and by that stage infection levels could be at very low rates. The scaling back may not seem that significant if that is the case. But the big caveat is that the government will retain the ability to ramp testing back up if the circumstances demand it - either because infection rates take a turn for a worse, or a new variant emerges. Mr Johnson also promised that the UK government would continue to work with the devolved administrations of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland as they decided how to take forward their own plans. But Scottish health secretary Humza Yousaf said free tests and self-isolating when positive with Covid were effective tools in suppressing the virus and said the public health advice the Scottish government had received ""does not advise removing these important interventions at this time"". He called for the UK government to continue supplying ""adequate"" funding for all parts of the UK to do what they deemed necessary to tackle the virus. Northern Ireland's health minister Robin Swann said his department would ""carefully consider"" England's plan, but no decisions had been made on changes to his country's test and trace programme. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer described the PM's plan as a ""half-baked announcement from a government paralysed by chaos and incompetence"". He said the PM's strategy was not ""a plan to live well with Covid"" and would instead ""leave us vulnerable"". Dr Chaand Nagpaul, council chairman of the BMA, said the strategy neglected some of society's most vulnerable and instead of giving people more freedom, it was likely to cause ""more uncertainty and anxiety"". ""Living with Covid-19 must not mean ignoring the virus all together - which in many respects the government's plan in England seems to do,"" he said. Dr Nagpaul called for ""urgent clarity"" on testing for NHS workers to protect staff and patients and that ""protections must be maintained for the most vulnerable, including the provision of enhanced face masks, and clear guidance for both patients and clinicians"". Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers which represents hospital trusts, said many NHS figures were ""concerned about the potential impact of these decisions"" and it was ""vital"" the government was ready to restore phased out testing and surveillance systems should they be needed. Ministers should assess the impact of restricting access to free testing, he said, warning there was a risk of ""significantly exacerbating health inequalities"". The Blood Cancer UK charity accused the government of lifting restrictions ""without a plan to protect immunocompromised people"" and warned the move would leave many of them ""feeling abandoned"". It said that of the 500,000 severely immunocompromised people in the UK, about 230,000 have blood cancer. Plan B measures - introduced in December to stem the spread of the Omicron variant - including the requirement to wear masks in public places and the use of Covid passes for large events, were abolished in England last month. Face masks continue to be a condition of carriage on London's transport network, but London mayor Sadiq Khan said on Monday that he expected the rules would be lifted following the PM's announcement. Just over 91% of people in the UK aged 12 and over have had a first dose of a vaccine, 85% a second jab, and 66% a booster or a third dose,according to official data,external. On Monday, the UK recorded a further 38,409 confirmed daily cases and another 15 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test. An axe has been taken to testing - does it matter?

"Linda McCall was convicted of attacks on five vulnerable children An inquiry into a case of abuse by a teacher has described the time it took a council to report concerns to a child protection unit as ""reprehensible"". Andrew Webster QC said this should have happened in October 2017 - but did not take place until about a year later. Scottish Borders Council has now issued an apology to parents over the case. Linda McCall, who was initially cleared of wrongdoing, was found guilty last year of assaulting five vulnerable children between 2016 and 2017. An independent inquiry was ordered into the case, andits report has now been made public,external. The families have previously told BBC Scotland of the ""life-changing trauma"" that had been caused by the case. Scottish Borders Council will meet to discuss the findings later this week The inquiry found that the council's procedures meant concerns should have been raised with the child protection unit in October 2017. It added that there were further occasions when they could have been reported, and the council ""compounded its failure"" to act promptly. Mr Webster said the fact that it took until October 2018 for the case to be taken to the child protection unit was ""reprehensible"". He said he could not rule out that the delay had caused ""unnecessary harm"" to children and that it had undoubtedly caused distress for parents. He also criticised the local authority's failure to recognise the significance of the conduct being alleged and deficiencies in its training in the reporting of child protection concerns. The inquiry has made 10 recommendations in light of its findings including: Improving child protection training Reviewing child protection and disciplinary procedures Improving communication with parents The 62-page report says other staff at the primary school where McCall was working as a teacher of complex needs raised concerns about her ""rough treatment"" of children in October 2017. She was moved to another location - away from pupils - and a disciplinary investigation launched which ultimately saw her reassigned to a different place of work. The council did not inform parents about the allegations or the disciplinary process but rumours began to circulate about the reasons for her departure - including the possibility children had been harmed. One parent was advised by a councillor that the rumours were not true but they persisted - leading to media reports of an alleged ""cover-up"" and concerns over the council's ""wall of silence"". It was only after a child protection investigation in late 2018 that the allegations - made about a year earlier - were brought to the attention of the police. One parent told BBC Scotland that the council should have apologised ""a lot sooner"". ""Finally, they are actually realising they have got something to apologise for,"" she added. Another parent shared the frustration about the time it had taken to receive ""a bit of a half-hearted apology"". ""It has just been an exhausting battle,"" she said. ""It feels a little bit better in some ways, but it still doesn't change what happened and that should never have happened. ""There need to be changes that ensure this never ever happens to another child again."" Marina Urie, a senior lawyer with Thompsons Solicitors, said the report ""completely vindicates the families"" and laid bare the council's failings. ""Thanks to the efforts of my clients, hopefully every child under the protection of Borders Council from now on will be looked after properly. ""The council are now subject to civil legal proceedings on behalf of children abused by their employee and we hope to conclude these matters soon."" Council leader Mark Rowley said what had happened was ""shocking and completely unacceptable"". He said he was sorry matters had not been referred to the child protection unit at their earliest opportunity, and for the council's failure to communicate appropriately with parents. ""Most of all, the council apologises wholeheartedly that the incidents of abuse occurred in the first place,"" he said. ""We must now learn from these mistakes and ensure they are never repeated."" Carol Hamilton, executive member for children and young people, said the report made ""very uncomfortable reading"" and the council ""should have done much better"". The council will meet to discuss the inquiry's findings on Friday and look at any changes required as a result of its recommendations.

You can read our main story on the end of legal restrictions in England on Thursday - and the end of free mass testing in April -here. Todayâs live page was written by Becky Morton, Joshua Nevett, Doug Faulkner, Justin Parkinson and Lauren Turner. It was edited by Claire Heald, Owen Amos and Kevin Ponniah. Many thanks for reading. Boris Johnson, Sir Patrick Vallance, and Sir Chris Whitty spent almost an hour giving statements and answering questions. Here are the main points: Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent Compared to previous variants, Omicron hasn't proved deadly for as many people. And testing is hugely expensive. Governments all over the world will have to take this decision at some point. But make no mistake - this is going down very well with Boris Johnson's backbenchers, at just the point that they hold his fate in their hands like never before. The leading voice in the Covid Recovery Group of Conservative MPs Mark Harper joked that it sounded like the PM was joining their number - a collection of backbenchers sceptical about some of the restrictions. It far from guarantees Boris Johnson's survival when the partygate rows flare up again. But it won't do him any harm. The scientists are asked whether there is a danger of giving the public mixed messages by ending self-isolation and universal free Covid testing. Prof Whitty says public health messaging is much more difficult when there is a ""transition"" but we have to accept we need to ""change the way we think about things"". He stresses that mandation is an issue for politicians and separate to public health advice. And with that final question the news conference ends - and Johnson says he is off to speak to the president of Ukraine about the ongoing crisis. The prime minister is asked whether scrapping universal free tests will add to the cost of living crisis. In response, Johnson says the change to the testing regime won't come through for a few weeks, by which point the government hopes and expects incidence of Covid will have further declined, so the impact on people will be minimal. He adds that having a strong economy is the ""single best protection"" against the cost of living crisis - and this would not have been possible if the government hadn't opened up the economy last summer. Asked whether it is hypocritical for him to ask people to take personal responsibility when he is under police investigation for breaking lockdown rules, Johnson says he cannot comment on these allegations. When asked if it's worth continuing to take regular Covid tests, Prof Whitty outlines three situations in which it might be sensible. The first, he says, is ""how common is Covid at the moment"". ""If itâs very high, absolutely, that increases probability,"" Whitty says. The second factor is the ""environment you're in"". ""If youâre in a crowded environment, absolutely,"" he says. And a test would be necessary before ""mixing with vulnerable people"", Whitty says. ""This is about minimising the risk to other people,"" he says.

For all the latest developments on the conflict, please follow us to the new link. President Joe Biden and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz have both said that cutting Russia off from the global banking system, Swift, is not being proposed right now. But what would happen if it was? Excluding Russia from Swift would risk severe repercussions for banks that are owed
money  - either now or in the longer term. This is particularly true in Germany, which has deep financial ties with Russia and feels it has done its share of economic sacrifice by suspending certification of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Although being de-Swifted would be disruptive for Russia, there is an alternate system - called CFPS - that Russia set up after it annexed Crimea in 2014. Similarly, China has also set up a secondary system, CIPS. Expelling Russia would probably only push it closer to China and play into the hands of the Xi administration, which is keen to ""de-dollarise"" the world's financial architecture. This would accelerate that trend and ambition. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky reportedly just said ""the enemy has designated me as the target number one, and my family as the target number two"". In a video address carried by Ukrainian media, Zelensky says he is staying in the capital Kyiv's ""government quarters"" and his family is also in Ukraine. He did not provide further details. Zelensky also warns that Ukrainian officials now have ""information that enemy sabotage groups have entered Kyiv"". The president did not elaborate on what those groups might be. More on the situation at Chernobyl tonight: White House press secretary Jen Psaki just told reporters at her daily briefing that there are reports Russian soldiers are holding the staff of the Ukrainian nuclear site hostage. ""We are outraged by credible reports that Russian soldiers are currently holding the staff of the Chernobyl facilities hostage,"" she said. ""This unlawful and dangerous hostage-taking, which could upend the routine civil service efforts required to maintain and protect the nuclear waste facilities, is obviously incredibly alarming and gravely concerning. ""We condemn it and we request their release."" Read more on this here. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson told his government on Thursday evening that Ukrainian soldiers have been putting up a fight, tweets the BBC's political correspondent Iain Watson.

Russian forces have taken control of Chernobyl, site of the 1986 nuclear disaster and a place that remains radioactive to this day - prompting significant concern from international nuclear watchdogs. Prof Claire Corkhill, nuclear materials expert at Sheffield University, told the BBC about the dangers of military clashes taking place near the site. âThis is not a place to have ammunition flying around,"" she said. The Chernobyl site contains several nuclear waste containment facilities - including the ânew safe confinementâ - the protective dome that covers the reactor that was so badly damaged by the infamous 1986 explosion. âThese buildings are designed to keep radioactive materials inside, but theyâre not necessarily armoured; theyâre not designed to operate in a war zone,â she said. Prof Corkhill said that although piercing one of these structures  wouldnât necessarily cause a repeat of the Chernobyl disaster - where plumes of radioactive material dispersed across Europe - it could âset us back 30 years in terms of the work that has been done clearing up the siteâ. It could release and disperse radioactive material in the local area, she said. Chris MorrisBBC Reality Check The Nord Stream 2 pipeline that would bring gas to Germany has shuttered amid the latest fighting There was plenty of criticism that Western sanctions in the days leading up to this invasion did not go far enough, fast enough. These new measures will hit the Russian economy much harder. But there are still potential gaps. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said sanctions against major Russian banks include one of the largest state banks, VTB, which will have all its assets frozen. But another major bank, Sberbank, was not mentioned. And the Ukrainian government wanted more â in particular moves to disconnect Russia from the international payment system known as Swift, which thousands of banks use to exchange information. The US and the UK are in favour of such a move, but some European countries fear it could damage their own banks. Suspending Russia from Swift is still under consideration, but the hesitation is a reminder that in a globalised world all sanctions tend to have an impact on the countries imposing them as well. And the real trouble with sanctions is that they donât work quickly. They do increase pressure, and they can do damage. But the international community is not trying to damage the Russian economy just for the sake of doing so. It wants economic pressure to force a change in Putinâs political and military calculations. Meanwhile, the invasion of Ukraine continues. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has just signed a decree ordering a general mobilisation. All Ukrainians who can carry arms have been urged to defend their homeland. The country's conscripts and reservists are also being called up, according to the decree, which is to be in effect for 90 days. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says 137 Ukrainian citizens - both soldiers and civilians - died on Thursday, the first day of a massive Russian military assault. Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News The head of Britain's MI6 has tweeted about intelligence on Ukraine. âUS and UK
intelligence communities uncovered Putinâs plans for Ukraine. We exposed his
attempts to engineer âfalse flagâ, fake attacks to justify his invasion. We
revealed his plans to assassinate Ukrainian leaders and senior officials,â
Richard Moore, also known as ""C"", said in a tweet. âThis attack was long
planned, unprovoked, cruel aggression. No amount of Russian disinformation will
now disguise that fact from the international community,"" wrote the Secret Intelligence Service chief. US and UK intelligence seem to have had an unusual and highly
accurate level of insight into Putinâs plans and strategy. The unprecedented
publicising of some of that intelligence has had tactical success in partly disrupting Putinâs plans - including for provocations and false flags. It may have also helped draw Western countries closer together. But even this
level of insight couldnât provide a way of stopping or deterring him. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Long queues have been seen at bus and train station in the capital Kyiv, as people have been desperately trying to go western regions of Ukraine All Ukrainian men aged between 18 to 60 are now banned from leaving the country, Ukraine's state border guard service (DPSA) says. It adds the measure is aimed at ""guaranteeing Ukraine's defence and the organisation of timely mobilisation"". The temporary ban will remain in force for the duration of martial law declared on Thursday morning. Steve RosenbergBBC Moscow Correspondent I think Vladimir Putin is fuelled by resentment at how the Cold War ended, with the West declaring victory and Russia losing power, influence and territory. I think he's also motivated by an almost semi-religious belief that Ukraine must be with Russia, must be in Russia's orbit, and Russia as a great power has the right to its own sphere of influence. I also think he has disdain for the West and Western leaders, whom he deems weak and disunited. What can the West do about this? Itâs very difficult to say. I think the Kremlin would've factored in sanctions. The Kremlin will know that the US will not put boots on the ground in Ukraine. The West does not want a war with Russia and Russia knows that. But I would say this. If youâve been in power for 22 years, as Putin has, you start to feel invincible, you start to think you canât put a foot wrong, that youâre Teflon. And that's when mistakes start to creep in. Just from speaking to people on the streets and witnessing the strength of feeling against this offensive, I wonder whether this Russian invasion will turn out to be Putin's fatal error. Countless city residents are hunkered in subways to avoid potential fighting Countless Kyiv residents are sleeping in underground metro stations as midnight approaches in Ukraine. The people - some of whom have brought their pets, extension cords and even air mattresses - are mostly calm, according to one evacuee. The place is ""not too crowded, most people are scrolling their phones, trying to catch the latest news"", says Oksana Potapova. ""We seem settled enough to spend the night here,"" she wrote on Facebook. ""And given the news about heavy fighting near Kyiv, the takeover of Chernobyl power plant, and forecasts of possible attacks on Kyiv, it seems like a good decision."" Paul AdamsBBC diplomatic correspondent A new iron curtain is falling
across Europe. Thatâs what this countryâs
beleaguered president, Volodymyr Zelensky, said in his most recent televised
statement. The echoes of Winston
Churchillâs famous 1946 speech in Fulton, Missouri were powerful. âFrom Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the
Adriatic, an iron curtain has descended across the continent,â Churchill told
his audience back then. Todayâs iron curtain has moved eastwards,
meandering from the Gulf of Finland, around Belarus and along Ukraineâs eastern
border and on down to the Black Sea. That, Zelensky says, is where it should stay, with
Ukraine firmly on the west. But that conviction feels like a fragile,
disappearing dream tonight, as Russian armour cuts deep into Ukrainian
territory, with the prospect of worse to come. With savage ferocity, Vladimir Putin has reached
out, grabbed Ukraine by the scruff of the neck and is trying, by force of arms,
to drag this hopeful nation back across the fence. Night has fallen and a curfew is in effect in Kyiv after the first full day of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. If you're just joining us, or catching up on events, here's what's been going on:  If you want more detail, you can read our guide to the conflict, and how it has unfolded today, byclicking here. Ilya BarabanovBBC Russian Service, Kyiv Smoke rises in the background as people walk down a street near the airfield All day long the Russian troops have been trying to take over an airfield at Hostomel, on the northern outskirts of the Ukrainian capital. This airfield is of strategic importance: if captured it could become a springboard for the Russian army into Kyiv. Judging from verified videos, at least two Russian helicopters were shot down over it. Journalists from CNN filmed a group of Russian paratroopers landing there while the Bellingcat investigative website said it had intelligence that 18 war planes with reinforcements were heading towards it from Russia. Later in the evening it became clear that a heavy battle for Hostomel was raging and Ukrainian forces were using both airstrikes and artillery. By 11pm Kyiv time (21:00 GMT) an official statement was released, saying that the airfield was back in the Ukrainian hands. A protester is detained in Saint Petersburg More than 1,700 people have been arrested during anti-war protests across dozens of cities in Russia, an independent monitor reports. More than 900 were arrested in Moscow and over 400 in Saint Petersburg, according to OVD-Info, which tracks arrests at opposition rallies. Thousands gathered near Pushkin Square in central Moscow, while up to 1,000 people gathered in the former imperial capital Saint Petersburg, the AFP news agency reports. Many held Ukrainian flags in Moscow ""No to war"" was spray-painted on the front gate of the Russian parliament's lower house. ""I am in shock. My relatives and loved ones live in Ukraine,"" Anastasia Nestulya, 23, told AFP in Moscow. ""What can I tell them over the phone? You hang in there?"" Navalny (standing) while on trial from prison Jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny - on trial in a Moscow prison -  has accused Vladimir Putin of using the invasion of Ukraine to cover up Russian corruption. In a video published by independent news outlet Dozhd, Navalny is heard expressing his opposition to the invasion of Ukraine. Wearing a prison uniform, he says it would lead to a ""huge number of victims, destroyed futures and the continuation of this line of impoverishment of the citizens of Russia"". This war between Russia and Ukraine was unleashed to cover up the theft from Russian citizens and divert their attention from problems that exist inside the country. Alexei Navalny Navalny has been jailed for over a year on old fraud charges, after surviving a poison attack, which he and the West say was carried out by the Kremlin. He is being tried inside the maximum security prison on new charges that could see his imprisonment extended by a decade. Vladimir Putin has spoken by phone to French President Emmanuel Macron and given him an ""exhaustive"" explanation of the reasons for
Russia's actions in Ukraine, the Kremlin says. Macron requested the call and they agreed to stay in contact, the Kremlin says. In France, the Elysee Palace says Macron spoke first to Ukraine's President Zelensky. He then spoke to President Putin and demanded an end to military operations and warned of massive sanctions. The French president has attempted to avert a Russian invasion in recent weeks, including holding talks
with Putin in the Kremlin. Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva The UN Refugee Agency warned today of a rapidly deteriorating situation in Ukraine as people flee their homes looking for safety. UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, warned ""the humanitarian consequences on civilian populations will be devastating. There are no winners in war but countless lives will be torn apart"". The refugee agency is calling on Ukraineâs neighbours to keep their borders open to those fleeing and says it stands ready to ""support efforts by all to respond to any situation of forced displacement"". Meanwhile, the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Peter Maurer, called on those fighting to respect international law, and to ensure civilians were protected. The UN had already issued a record appeal for funding in 2022 to relieve crises in Syria, Yemen, Afghanistan, and the drought-ridden Sahel region in Africa. A further major conflict and refugee crisis in the middle of Europe could stretch its resources well beyond their limits. Â© 2025 BBC.

"People should not be forced into making a ""terrible choice"" over going into work with Covid or risking losing income by self-isolating at home, the Trades Union Congress (TUC) has said. The trade union raised concerns ahead of the just-announced scrapping of the law in England to self-isolate. It said two million workers in low-paid jobs do not qualify for sick pay. Boris Johnson set out plans for the end of all Covid rules in England in the House of Commons this afternoon. From Thursday, the legal requirement to self-isolate after a positive Covid test will be removed in England, the prime minister announced. Self-isolation payments will also end from this date. At the moment, positive or asymptomatic people have to isolate for up to 10 days, but can end their isolation earlier if they register negative lateral flow tests on both days five and six. Leader of the Opposition Sir Keir Starmer said cutting support payments will hit the lowest-paid the hardest. As well as scrapping isolation requirements, Boris Johnson announced the end of free Covid tests for the general public, after the prime minister said Â£2bn was spent on tests in January. Business Minister Paul Scully told the BBC's Today programme earlier on Monday that the money ""could be spent on other priorities"" as cases and deaths continue to fall. ""We want to get people back into their workplaces, we want to get the economy working, but it will be up to employers and employees,"" he added. Living with Covid plan to restore our freedom - PM Are we ready for last Covid rule to be ditched? Kate Bell of the TUC said people who did not qualify for sick pay due to their wages were facing a ""major issue"" over choosing whether to self-isolate with Covid or not. ""If they have got Covid they want to be able to stay at home without facing a terrible choice about whether that means losing income for a week and they want to keep their colleagues safe and the other people they work with safe too,"" she said. ""That shouldn't be a choice that people are forced to make on their own."" Meanwhile, TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady told the BBC's World at One that workers could not be expected to ""fork out themselves for tests"". ""Just hoping that employers will do the right thing I think is frankly for the birds"", she added. ""Millions of workers need the government to take responsibility and not just gamble on their health, or frankly, our public health."" The prime minister has said the end to restrictions will return people's freedoms, but some experts have urged caution. Rachel Knappier, director of service at HR company Croner, told the Today programme that it looked like the decision over isolation would be ""put back in the hands"" of employers. She urged workers who were concerned to speak to their employers and said it was ""really important"" businesses have clear policies. The legal requirement to self-isolate for a fixed period after testing positive in England has been in place ever since mass testing was rolled out. Before that, most Covid testing was limited to people as they arrived in hospital with symptoms. Charlene Lyons, chief executive of the Black Sheep Brewery, told the BBC the company would pay for Covid tests for staff ""if we need to"". But she said she did not think the brewer would be ""happy paying them sick pay"" if someone had a dry cough. ""Luckily the majority of people, they can work from home if they need to,"" she added. ""For us, we're trying to adopt a principle whereby this is something we need to live with, it's like flu. ""If you feel unwell you stay off work, if you feel well you come in."" Ms Lyons said there had been ""various conversations"" with people who felt vulnerable, and added people could be isolated in the company's offices from others. Meanwhile, Chelsea Garside, who runs Ziba Hair and Beauty Salon in Monton in Greater Manchester, said she hoped people would ""use their common sense"" on isolating. ""If you're poorly, you wouldn't come to an appointment. If you had the flu, you wouldn't go to work and risk spreading it,"" she said. Ms Garside said she thought she would provide tests for her team to make it easier for them to come into work and ""create a happy space in the salon"".

"Russian forces launch a full-scale assault on Ukraine, with its military attacking the country from the north, east and south Ukrainian President Zelensky says 137 Ukrainian citizens - both soldiers and civilians - died on Thursday People in the capital, Kyiv, and elsewhere are trying to flee - some 100,000 have left so far, the UN says There are also renewed reports of explosions in the port city of Mariupol, home to half a million people Russians seize control of the Chernobyl complex - site of the world's worst nuclear disaster UK and US announce fresh new sanctions on Russia, including asset freezes on banks President Vladimir Putin defends his move, saying there was no other way to defend Russia But US President Joe Biden says Putin's aggression will cost Russia dearly Edited by Jude Sheerin For technical reasons too boring to explain, we are switching our live coverageto a new webpage here. For all the latest developments on the conflict, please follow us to the new link. President Joe Biden and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz have both said that cutting Russia off from the global banking system, Swift, is not being proposed right now. But what would happen if it was? Excluding Russia from Swift would risk severe repercussions for banks that are owed
money  - either now or in the longer term. This is particularly true in Germany, which has deep financial ties with Russia and feels it has done its share of economic sacrifice by suspending certification of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Although being de-Swifted would be disruptive for Russia, there is an alternate system - called CFPS - that Russia set up after it annexed Crimea in 2014. Similarly, China has also set up a secondary system, CIPS. Expelling Russia would probably only push it closer to China and play into the hands of the Xi administration, which is keen to ""de-dollarise"" the world's financial architecture. This would accelerate that trend and ambition. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky reportedly just said ""the enemy has designated me as the target number one, and my family as the target number two"". In a video address carried by Ukrainian media, Zelensky says he is staying in the capital Kyiv's ""government quarters"" and his family is also in Ukraine. He did not provide further details. Zelensky also warns that Ukrainian officials now have ""information that enemy sabotage groups have entered Kyiv"". The president did not elaborate on what those groups might be. More on the situation at Chernobyl tonight: White House press secretary Jen Psaki just told reporters at her daily briefing that there are reports Russian soldiers are holding the staff of the Ukrainian nuclear site hostage. ""We are outraged by credible reports that Russian soldiers are currently holding the staff of the Chernobyl facilities hostage,"" she said. ""This unlawful and dangerous hostage-taking, which could upend the routine civil service efforts required to maintain and protect the nuclear waste facilities, is obviously incredibly alarming and gravely concerning. ""We condemn it and we request their release."" Read more on this here. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson told his government on Thursday evening that Ukrainian soldiers have been putting up a fight, tweets the BBC's political correspondent Iain Watson.

Russian forces have taken control of Chernobyl, site of the 1986 nuclear disaster and a place that remains radioactive to this day - prompting significant concern from international nuclear watchdogs. Prof Claire Corkhill, nuclear materials expert at Sheffield University, told the BBC about the dangers of military clashes taking place near the site. âThis is not a place to have ammunition flying around,"" she said. The Chernobyl site contains several nuclear waste containment facilities - including the ânew safe confinementâ - the protective dome that covers the reactor that was so badly damaged by the infamous 1986 explosion. âThese buildings are designed to keep radioactive materials inside, but theyâre not necessarily armoured; theyâre not designed to operate in a war zone,â she said. Prof Corkhill said that although piercing one of these structures  wouldnât necessarily cause a repeat of the Chernobyl disaster - where plumes of radioactive material dispersed across Europe - it could âset us back 30 years in terms of the work that has been done clearing up the siteâ. It could release and disperse radioactive material in the local area, she said. Chris MorrisBBC Reality Check The Nord Stream 2 pipeline that would bring gas to Germany has shuttered amid the latest fighting There was plenty of criticism that Western sanctions in the days leading up to this invasion did not go far enough, fast enough. These new measures will hit the Russian economy much harder. But there are still potential gaps. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said sanctions against major Russian banks include one of the largest state banks, VTB, which will have all its assets frozen. But another major bank, Sberbank, was not mentioned. And the Ukrainian government wanted more â in particular moves to disconnect Russia from the international payment system known as Swift, which thousands of banks use to exchange information. The US and the UK are in favour of such a move, but some European countries fear it could damage their own banks. Suspending Russia from Swift is still under consideration, but the hesitation is a reminder that in a globalised world all sanctions tend to have an impact on the countries imposing them as well. And the real trouble with sanctions is that they donât work quickly. They do increase pressure, and they can do damage. But the international community is not trying to damage the Russian economy just for the sake of doing so. It wants economic pressure to force a change in Putinâs political and military calculations. Meanwhile, the invasion of Ukraine continues. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has just signed a decree ordering a general mobilisation. All Ukrainians who can carry arms have been urged to defend their homeland. The country's conscripts and reservists are also being called up, according to the decree, which is to be in effect for 90 days. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says 137 Ukrainian citizens - both soldiers and civilians - died on Thursday, the first day of a massive Russian military assault. Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News The head of Britain's MI6 has tweeted about intelligence on Ukraine. âUS and UK
intelligence communities uncovered Putinâs plans for Ukraine. We exposed his
attempts to engineer âfalse flagâ, fake attacks to justify his invasion. We
revealed his plans to assassinate Ukrainian leaders and senior officials,â
Richard Moore, also known as ""C"", said in a tweet. âThis attack was long
planned, unprovoked, cruel aggression. No amount of Russian disinformation will
now disguise that fact from the international community,"" wrote the Secret Intelligence Service chief. US and UK intelligence seem to have had an unusual and highly
accurate level of insight into Putinâs plans and strategy. The unprecedented
publicising of some of that intelligence has had tactical success in partly disrupting Putinâs plans - including for provocations and false flags. It may have also helped draw Western countries closer together. But even this
level of insight couldnât provide a way of stopping or deterring him. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Long queues have been seen at bus and train station in the capital Kyiv, as people have been desperately trying to go western regions of Ukraine All Ukrainian men aged between 18 to 60 are now banned from leaving the country, Ukraine's state border guard service (DPSA) says. It adds the measure is aimed at ""guaranteeing Ukraine's defence and the organisation of timely mobilisation"". The temporary ban will remain in force for the duration of martial law declared on Thursday morning. Steve RosenbergBBC Moscow Correspondent I think Vladimir Putin is fuelled by resentment at how the Cold War ended, with the West declaring victory and Russia losing power, influence and territory. I think he's also motivated by an almost semi-religious belief that Ukraine must be with Russia, must be in Russia's orbit, and Russia as a great power has the right to its own sphere of influence. I also think he has disdain for the West and Western leaders, whom he deems weak and disunited. What can the West do about this? Itâs very difficult to say. I think the Kremlin would've factored in sanctions. The Kremlin will know that the US will not put boots on the ground in Ukraine. The West does not want a war with Russia and Russia knows that. But I would say this. If youâve been in power for 22 years, as Putin has, you start to feel invincible, you start to think you canât put a foot wrong, that youâre Teflon. And that's when mistakes start to creep in. Just from speaking to people on the streets and witnessing the strength of feeling against this offensive, I wonder whether this Russian invasion will turn out to be Putin's fatal error. Countless city residents are hunkered in subways to avoid potential fighting Countless Kyiv residents are sleeping in underground metro stations as midnight approaches in Ukraine. The people - some of whom have brought their pets, extension cords and even air mattresses - are mostly calm, according to one evacuee. The place is ""not too crowded, most people are scrolling their phones, trying to catch the latest news"", says Oksana Potapova. ""We seem settled enough to spend the night here,"" she wrote on Facebook. ""And given the news about heavy fighting near Kyiv, the takeover of Chernobyl power plant, and forecasts of possible attacks on Kyiv, it seems like a good decision."" Paul AdamsBBC diplomatic correspondent A new iron curtain is falling
across Europe. Thatâs what this countryâs
beleaguered president, Volodymyr Zelensky, said in his most recent televised
statement. The echoes of Winston
Churchillâs famous 1946 speech in Fulton, Missouri were powerful. âFrom Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the
Adriatic, an iron curtain has descended across the continent,â Churchill told
his audience back then. Todayâs iron curtain has moved eastwards,
meandering from the Gulf of Finland, around Belarus and along Ukraineâs eastern
border and on down to the Black Sea. That, Zelensky says, is where it should stay, with
Ukraine firmly on the west. But that conviction feels like a fragile,
disappearing dream tonight, as Russian armour cuts deep into Ukrainian
territory, with the prospect of worse to come. With savage ferocity, Vladimir Putin has reached
out, grabbed Ukraine by the scruff of the neck and is trying, by force of arms,
to drag this hopeful nation back across the fence. Night has fallen and a curfew is in effect in Kyiv after the first full day of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. If you're just joining us, or catching up on events, here's what's been going on:  If you want more detail, you can read our guide to the conflict, and how it has unfolded today, byclicking here. Ilya BarabanovBBC Russian Service, Kyiv Smoke rises in the background as people walk down a street near the airfield All day long the Russian troops have been trying to take over an airfield at Hostomel, on the northern outskirts of the Ukrainian capital. This airfield is of strategic importance: if captured it could become a springboard for the Russian army into Kyiv. Judging from verified videos, at least two Russian helicopters were shot down over it. Journalists from CNN filmed a group of Russian paratroopers landing there while the Bellingcat investigative website said it had intelligence that 18 war planes with reinforcements were heading towards it from Russia. Later in the evening it became clear that a heavy battle for Hostomel was raging and Ukrainian forces were using both airstrikes and artillery. By 11pm Kyiv time (21:00 GMT) an official statement was released, saying that the airfield was back in the Ukrainian hands. A protester is detained in Saint Petersburg More than 1,700 people have been arrested during anti-war protests across dozens of cities in Russia, an independent monitor reports. More than 900 were arrested in Moscow and over 400 in Saint Petersburg, according to OVD-Info, which tracks arrests at opposition rallies. Thousands gathered near Pushkin Square in central Moscow, while up to 1,000 people gathered in the former imperial capital Saint Petersburg, the AFP news agency reports. Many held Ukrainian flags in Moscow ""No to war"" was spray-painted on the front gate of the Russian parliament's lower house. ""I am in shock. My relatives and loved ones live in Ukraine,"" Anastasia Nestulya, 23, told AFP in Moscow. ""What can I tell them over the phone? You hang in there?"" Navalny (standing) while on trial from prison Jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny - on trial in a Moscow prison -  has accused Vladimir Putin of using the invasion of Ukraine to cover up Russian corruption. In a video published by independent news outlet Dozhd, Navalny is heard expressing his opposition to the invasion of Ukraine. Wearing a prison uniform, he says it would lead to a ""huge number of victims, destroyed futures and the continuation of this line of impoverishment of the citizens of Russia"". This war between Russia and Ukraine was unleashed to cover up the theft from Russian citizens and divert their attention from problems that exist inside the country. Alexei Navalny Navalny has been jailed for over a year on old fraud charges, after surviving a poison attack, which he and the West say was carried out by the Kremlin. He is being tried inside the maximum security prison on new charges that could see his imprisonment extended by a decade. Vladimir Putin has spoken by phone to French President Emmanuel Macron and given him an ""exhaustive"" explanation of the reasons for
Russia's actions in Ukraine, the Kremlin says. Macron requested the call and they agreed to stay in contact, the Kremlin says. In France, the Elysee Palace says Macron spoke first to Ukraine's President Zelensky. He then spoke to President Putin and demanded an end to military operations and warned of massive sanctions. The French president has attempted to avert a Russian invasion in recent weeks, including holding talks
with Putin in the Kremlin. Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva The UN Refugee Agency warned today of a rapidly deteriorating situation in Ukraine as people flee their homes looking for safety. UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, warned ""the humanitarian consequences on civilian populations will be devastating. There are no winners in war but countless lives will be torn apart"". The refugee agency is calling on Ukraineâs neighbours to keep their borders open to those fleeing and says it stands ready to ""support efforts by all to respond to any situation of forced displacement"". Meanwhile, the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Peter Maurer, called on those fighting to respect international law, and to ensure civilians were protected. The UN had already issued a record appeal for funding in 2022 to relieve crises in Syria, Yemen, Afghanistan, and the drought-ridden Sahel region in Africa. A further major conflict and refugee crisis in the middle of Europe could stretch its resources well beyond their limits. Â© 2025 BBC.

"The Zoom call had about 40 people on it  - or that's what the people who had logged on thought. The all-staff meeting at the glamorous design agency had been called to welcome the growing company's newest recruits. Its name was Madbird and its dynamic and inspirational boss, Ali Ayad, wanted everyone on the call to be ambitious hustlers - just like him. But what those who had turned on their cameras didn't know was that some of the others in the meeting weren't real people. Yes, they were listed as participants. Some even had active email accounts and LinkedIn profiles. But their names were made up and their headshots belonged to other people. The whole thing was fake - the real employees had been ""jobfished"". The BBC has spent a year investigating what happened. Chris Doocey, a 27-year-old sales manager based in Manchester, started at Madbird in October 2020, a few months before the Zoom call. He would be working from home, but the pandemic was still raging, so that was normal. Covid had upended Chris's life. It had cost him his last job and was the reason he'd applied for this role at Madbird. The ad described a ""human-centred digital design agency born in London, running worldwide"". It sounded good. Madbird hired more than 50 others. Most worked in sales, some in design and some were brought in to supervise. Every new joiner was instructed to work from home - messaging over email and speaking to each other on Zoom. Days were often long. Jordan Carter from Suffolk, who was 26 at the time, was credited with being one of the hardest working members of Chris's sales team. In five months, he pitched Madbird to 10,000 possible business clients, hoping to win deals to redesign websites or build apps. By January 2021, his work ethic had earned him the title Employee of the Month. Other staff lived outside the UK. Keen to tap into a global market, Madbird's HR department posted job ads online for an international sales team based out of Dubai. At least a dozen people from Uganda, India, South Africa, the Philippines and elsewhere were hired. Job adverts were placed for Madbird teams in London and Dubai For them, the job represented more than just a pay cheque - but a UK visa too. If they passed their six-month probation period, and met their sales targets, their contracts said Madbird would sponsor them to move to the UK. Ali Ayad knew what it could mean to make a new life in the UK. He often talked to Madbird staff about his past before settling in London. But there were many versions of his story. To one person he introduced himself as a Mormon, from Utah in the US. To others, he was from Lebanon, where a difficult childhood had taught him how to be a hustler. Even his name changed. Sometimes he added a second ""y"" to his surname, spelling it ""Ayyad"". Other times he signed off as ""Alex Ayd"". But some chapters in the story he told people were consistent. Key - above all - was the time he spent as a creative designer at Nike. He told everyone about working at the fashion brand's Oregon headquarters in the US. It was where he'd met Dave Stanfield, Madbird's co-founder. The stories about Ali's high-flying career didn't seem far-fetched. He was a smooth operator on video calls - intense, charismatic, even appearing caring. He spoke with confidence, sometimes bordering on bullishness. It is how he persuaded at least three people to quit other jobs to work for him. Ali Ayad has over 90,000 followers on his Instagram - in his bio he describes himself as an ""influencer"" Madbird's staff had no reason to doubt Ali's Nike stories. And if they did, all they had to do was check his LinkedIn profile. It glowed with lengthy endorsements from former colleagues. Ali Ayad ""floored me with how meaningful and thoughtful his approach was"", read one comment - supposedly from a creative director at Nike. ""Agencies can be filled with copycats but that's not Ali. He brings originality and authenticity to any project he works on."" And then there was his business partner, Dave Stanfield. At Nike, Ali Ayad was ""instrumental"" and ""one of the best professionals I've ever worked with,"" read his testimony. Ali's optimism and energy were contagious. One person he hired compared her new boss to Tom Cruise. But the two people whom Ali compared himself to most often were Steve Jobs and Elon Musk. The tech titans were Ali's idols. ""Elon Musk works 16 hours a day, I'm trying to do 17!"" he wrote in one email trying to motivate his team to keep pushing through. And - weighing up another tough business decision - he used a quote often attributed to Steve Jobs. ""If you want to make everybody happy, don't be a leader, go sell ice cream."" For months, Madbird's daily business hummed along, more designers were hired to meet the backlog of briefs being negotiated by the sales team. But even before the truth about Madbird was revealed, its workers had a problem. Because of the unusual way their contracts had been written, they were yet to be paid. Reporter Catrin Nye exposes Ali Ayad's tangled web of lies and ends up confronting him to get to the truth. WatchJobfishedon 21 February at 21:00 on BBC Three orBBC iPlayer. They had all agreed to work on a commission-only basis for the first six months. It was only after they passed their probation period that they would be put on a salary - about Â£35,000 ($47,300) for most. Until then, they would only earn a percentage of every deal they negotiated. They were all young adults looking for work and living through a pandemic. Many felt they had no choice but to accept the terms in their contracts. But no deals were ever finalised. By February 2021, not a single client contract had been signed. None of the Madbird staff had been paid a penny. Some recruits ended up leaving after a few weeks, but many stayed. Many had been there for almost six months - forced to take out credit cards and borrow money from family to keep on top of bills. The longer you worked at Madbird, the harder it became to leave. What if one of the big deals you'd been working on came through next week? It made no sense to resign just as you were about to finish your probation period. For many, a salary seemed within grasp. Plus, in the middle of the pandemic, jobs were hard to find. It is obvious now why no-one was paid. Madbird had no money coming in. But that wasn't obvious to new staff. They mistakenly assumed their pay contracts were unique - and that their line managers must have been on salaries. Besides, Madbird was on the cusp of signing a whole bunch of deals. The money was finally coming. Or that is how it appeared until everything crumbled one afternoon. Gemma Brett became suspicious soon after she started working for Madbird Gemma Brett, a 27-year-old designer from west London, had only been working at Madbird for two weeks when she spotted something strange. Curious about what her commute would be like when the pandemic was over, she searched for the company's office address. The result looked nothing like the videos on Madbird's website of a sleek workspace buzzing with creative-types. Instead, Google Street View showed an upmarket block of flats in London's Kensington. Gemma contacted an estate agent with a listing at the same address who confirmed her suspicion - the building was purely residential. We later corroborated this by speaking to someone who'd worked in the building for years. They had never seen Ali Ayad. The block of flats was not the global headquarters of a design firm called Madbird. Gemma shared her discovery with another Madbird employee she had got to know and trust - Antonia Stuart, who was leading the company's expansion into Dubai. Antonia Stuart was hired to work as Madbird's head of creative based in Dubai Using online reverse image searches they dug deeper. They found that almost all the work Madbird claimed as its own had been stolen from elsewhere on the internet - and that some of the colleagues they'd been messaging online didn't exist. They thought about their options. One was to leave quietly without causing a stir. They had no idea who was behind this con, or the scale of it. They were scared. On the other hand, they worried if the truth wasn't exposed innocent staff could end up in trouble if they completed deals for Madbird based on lies. Deals were just days away. In the end, they decided to send an all-staff email from an alias - Jane Smith. The email was sent on a busy workday afternoon and accused Madbird's founders of ""unethical and immoral"" behaviour - including stealing the work of others and ""fabricating"" team members. The revelations were devastating for real staff members. Everything they had been doing, it seemed, was built on lies. It now looked like they'd never see any money in return for months of their time and hard work. It was at this moment that we began our own investigation into Madbird. We corroborated the claims in the Jane Smith email, and went even further. The company had not been ""shipping products and experiences locally and globally for 10 years"" as it had claimed. In fact, Ali Ayad only registered Madbird with Companies House on the same day he interviewed Chris Doocey to be a sales manager - 23 September 2020. At least six of the most senior employees profiled by Madbird were fake. Their identities stitched together using photos stolen from random corners of the internet and made-up names. They included Madbird's co-founder, Dave Stanfield - despite him having a LinkedIn profile and Ali referring to him constantly. Some of the duped staff had even received emails from him. Ali told one employee that if they wanted to get in touch with Mr Stanfield they should email him, because he was too busy with projects for Nike to jump on a call. Using facial recognition technology we were able to match Dave Stanfield's headshot to its actual owner - a Prague-based beehive maker named Michal Kalis. When we tracked Michal down, he confirmed he had never heard of Madbird, Ali Ayad or Dave Stanfield. Nigel White was another. Someone using his name had even logged into that January Zoom call. But his photo wasn't of a graphic designer - it was a model whose image was one of the first results when you searched for ""ginger man"" in Getty Images' stock library. His face appeared all over the internet. Others were even wackier. A graphic designer, brand growth manager, and marketing manager at Madbird actually turned out to be pictures of a Lebanese doctor, a Spanish actor, and an Italian fashion influencer. All of their photos had been stolen to create fake identities. We contacted all 42 brands Madbird had listed as former clients - including Nike, Tate, and Toni & Guy. None of those that responded had ever worked with Madbird. But what about the impressive portfolios of client design work that Madbird had been showcasing with its branding all over it? Lots was ripped from the internet. Reporter Catrin Nye tries to work out who working at Madbird is real and who is fake One pitch document distributed to Madbird's potential clients had been copied from a London-based design firm called Hatched, in some places lifted word-for-word. When we contacted them, they were shocked. Hatched's bosses told us they had written the pitch document in 2016. The personal bios of their top team had also been stolen and used in the profiles of Madbird's fake staff. Ali's own backstory crumbled, too. He had never worked for Nike as a ""creative lead"" in the US, like he claimed. Nike confirmed to us in writing it hadn't employed anyone with his name - or any of his aliases. The prestigious US and Canadian universities that Ali said he had attended didn't even offer the degrees he claimed to have studied. Neither the University of Southern California nor Concordia University recognised his name among their lists of former students. And then there was Ali's Instagram account, where he posted updates about his career as a model and influencer to more than 90,000 followers. His social media presence had been one of the reasons many of Madbird's workers admired and trusted him. But the life Ali presented on Instagram was only distantly related to the life he actually lived. One post in particular caught our attention. It was a photo showing an open issue of GQ magazine, with Ali Ayad modelling a blazer in a full-page ad for Spanish fashion brand Massimo Dutti. ""Hustle in silence, let your success make the noise,"" read the caption. Ali Ayad's Instagram included a post claiming he had modelled for Massimo Dutti in British GQ which received 4,000 'likes' The actual issue of British GQ featured a watch advert on the page But when we got hold of the GQ issue and opened it to page 63, the photo of Ali wasn't there. It was an advert for a watch. Ali Ayad had never modelled for Massimo Dutti, and he had never been featured in British GQ. The morning after the allegations landed from Gemma and Antonia in their Jane Smith email, Ali Ayad sent his own email to the Madbird team. ""If any of this information came to be true,"" he wrote, it is as ""shocking to me as it's shocking to all of you."" Ali Ayad was claiming complete ignorance. But, as the company's director, he said he would still take full responsibility. He promised to remove Madbird's website and pause all ongoing work ""until we fix this"". And then, before he signed off for a final time, a flash of remorse. ""I have put 16 hours every single day for months and done the best that I could to make this work. I should've known better and for that I'm truly sorry."" It was the closest to a meaningful apology that Madbird's staff would get. Ali Ayad soon went quiet. He stopped answering calls from his confused workers and blocked others. Madbird's website went offline, and Ali's LinkedIn profile vanished. Just like that, the man withdrew into the same digital ether from which he had emerged. Have you worked with Ali Ayad in the past? Or have you been jobfished by someone else? Let us know: jobfished@bbc.co.uk Madbird's former workers were devastated. Some had spent as long as six months working for no pay. Now they were jobless in the middle of a pandemic, and struggling to even describe what had just happened to them. Sales manager Chris Doocey had racked up a credit card debt of Â£10,000 to pay his monthly bills while waiting for his first pay cheque. ââStephie Nkoy-Nyama, from east London, had quit a good job to join Madbird. Her last company had kept her on during the pandemic even while letting others go. She felt pressured by Ali into quitting that job to join his company. ""He played us like fools."" 'He played us like fools' says Stephie Nkoy-Nyama And then, there were the international staff. Elvis John, originally from Chennai in India, had at one point been expecting to be on a flight to the UK. He was now just weeks from finishing his six-month probation period and hoping that Ali would sponsor his visa. When the Jane Smith email landed he fell into depression. ""My dreams just shattered."" Because Elvis had been doing the job in Dubai the stakes were even higher. He believes that if he had negotiated any deals to completion he would have faced serious legal consequences under Dubai's strict business rules - possibly imprisonment and deportation back to India. ""I don't know if Ali will ever understand what he put us through,"" says Elvis - who feels the whole thing was treated like a game. Elvis John fears he could have faced legal action in Dubai had any Madbird deals been signed Many were embarrassed to have been caught up in it. Some waited days and even weeks before telling friends and family the truth. And to others, the story was difficult to explain - and always met with questions to which none of the tricked staff had answers. Three former workers pursued Madbird through an employment tribunal, arguing they should at least be paid minimum wage for their time there. Ali didn't respond to the tribunal in time, and so a judge ordered the trio be paid Â£19,000 in wages in total. Ali appealed against the decision, which the tribunal upheld. He is now appealing again. But if he fails once more, that doesn't mean the trio will see any money. The tribunal order was made against the company, not against Ali Ayad as an individual. So if Madbird was insolvent, like Ali said, there was no way the tribunal could force it to pay any of the owed wages. It didn't have the money. At least one Madbird worker was offered money. James Harris from York had worked there for two weeks as a designer when the revelations came out. Eleven months later he received a cheque in the post for Â£29.70, retrieved by HMRC's Minimum Wage Unit. Ali had apparently agreed to pay the money in recognition of a few hours' unpaid training James had done. James Harris ended up receiving less than Â£30 for the work he did at Madbird Did Ali Ayad understand the consequences of his actions? For a time Ali said he was going to speak to us to give his version of events. After months of messages back and forth, he eventually agreed to a sit-down, on-camera interview with us at the BBC. But then, with a day's notice, he dropped out. If we were going to get Ali Ayad's version of events we had no choice but to seek him out. We tracked him down to a west London street one afternoon last October, where we confronted him. He was dressed in a black leather jacket and on his way to an underground station. If he was surprised by us, he didn't show it - choosing at first to ignore our questions. But after a while he couldn't help but speak. He insisted he had been trying to do something good. ""All I know is that we created opportunities for people. In the midst of Covid."" When we accused him of creating fake identities and stealing other people's work, he got angry. ""I did? How do you know I did?"" Was he implying someone else was involved? When we pushed him, he wouldn't name anyone. There was always the possibility that some anonymous mastermind was behind everything, and it is something we seriously considered. But without any names or help from Ali, it was a path we were unable to pursue. Ali also insisted that Madbird did have an office. But when we challenged him he backtracked, implying he meant a virtual office. ""You don't really have to have computers and stuff, right? It's a digital company."" This video can not be played Watch: the moment investigative reporter Catrin Nye confronts Madbird's director Eventually, he stopped answering our questions. We later wrote to give him another chance to respond to the accusations. He replied, conceding that a ""couple of points"" he was being accused of were true - he wouldn't say which. He also said that the ""majority"" of the 24 separate points we had put to him in writing were ""absurd and incorrect"". He said he would respond more fully, but never did. As long as Ali Ayad refuses to play ball we will never know for certain why he created Madbird. For those who spent the most time with him online, exchanging emails and on video calls, two theories stand out. One is that the whole thing was an attempt to start an actual business. It may have started out as a lie, but maybe Madbird would eventually start closing real deals and making money. The company, staff believed, was just days from signing on clients when everything fell apart. If the lies hadn't been uncovered, maybe no-one would have ever exposed Madbird's murky origins. Another explanation is that it was about more than money. Maybe Ali Ayad got a kick out of pretending to be a boss. He genuinely appeared to enjoy his time running Madbird. Job interviews with him often lasted more than an hour. He told stories about how he had turned people's lives around by spotting their talent and giving them a chance. He sent staff links to deep house music to listen to while working. He wanted to be a cool boss - and, for the months Madbird was online, that's how people treated him. The pandemic changed the way many of us worked - communicating through a screen became the norm. Ali Ayad exploited that. It was as if he wanted to be the next Elon Musk - and, in Madbird, he thought he had found a shortcut. A universe where he would be judged solely by his online presence rather than the offline reality. And the most shocking part of Ali Ayad's gamble? The fact that we live in an age where it nearly worked. The Madbird which was the subject of our investigation was registered to an address in central London.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson has announced the end of coronavirus restrictions in England All Covid restrictions will end in England on Thursday and free mass testing will stop from 1 April. The prime minister told MPs the legal duty to isolate for those who tested positive would be dropped as he unveiled his""living with Covid"" plan,external. From 1 April the provision of free testing would be targeted to the most vulnerable, Boris Johnson said. But the British Medical Association, a doctors' union, said the plan failed to protect those most at risk from Covid. And opposition parties said the prime minister's blueprint out of the pandemic had moved too fast, and voiced concern over the scaling back of free testing. The Scottish government said the public health advice it had received did not recommend lifting the restrictions. An axe has been taken to testing - does it matter? What is England's 'Living with Covid' plan? Spring Covid booster for over-75s and high risk Businesses warn against end of free Covid tests Speaking at a Downing Street news conference on Monday evening, Mr Johnson said ""today is not the day we can declare victory over Covid because this virus is not going away"". He described the pandemic as ""two of the darkest, grimmest years in our peacetime history"". However, he said the nation had passed the peak of Omicron, with falling cases and hospital admissions. And he said the country could now complete the ""transition back towards normality"" while retaining contingencies to respond to a Covid resurgence or a new variant. England's chief medical officer Prof Sir Chris Whitty said the ending of virus restrictions was a ""gradual, steady change over a period of time"", adding: ""This is not a sudden 'everything stops'."" He said the number of people being infected with Omicron was still ""very high"". Office for National Statistics (ONS) infection figures last week estimated that one in 20 people in England had Covid. Sir Chris said the public health advice for people with Covid would still be to self-isolate to prevent others catching it, as it would be for many other highly infectious diseases. Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK government's chief scientific adviser, warned the virus would continue to evolve over the next couple of years and there was no guarantee that future variants would be less severe than Omicron. He argued it was crucial the nation retained a virus surveillance system to monitor new threats and the capacity to ""ramp up"" measures again quickly to protect the vulnerable. From 21 February: the government is dropping guidance for staff and students in most education and childcare settings to undertake twice weekly asymptomatic testing From Thursday 24 February: People who test positive for Covid will no longer be legally required to self-isolate But they will still be advised to stay at home and avoid contact with others for at least five full days Routine contact tracing will end, so fully-vaccinated close contacts and those under 18 will no longer be legally required to test daily for seven days The Â£500 self-isolation support payment for people on low incomes who test positive for Covid will no longer be available Covid provisions for increased statutory sick pay will apply for a further month From 1 April: Free mass symptomatic and asymptomatic testing for the general public will end, and will instead be targeted towards the most vulnerable People with Covid symptoms will be asked to exercise personal responsibility when deciding whether to stay at home - until then they are still advised to do so Current government guidance on Covid passports will end and it will no longer recommend venues use the NHS Covid pass You can read more about the changes here Earlier, Mr Johnson told MPs it was time to move from government restrictions to people exercising personal responsibility. It was only because levels of immunity were so high and deaths were now ""below where you would normally expect for this time of year"" that the government could lift the restrictions, he said. As Omicron was less severe, testing for it ""on the colossal scale we've been doing"" was less important and less valuable in preventing serious illness, he added. Limited free lateral flow tests for the most vulnerable groups would still be provided, the PM said, and ministers would work with retailers to ensure everyone who wanted a test could buy one. The PM did not specify which groups of people would be deemed ""most vulnerable"". To prevent the stockpiling of free lateral flow tests before 1 April, people will only be able to order a box of tests every three days instead of every 24 hours. Once tests are no longer free, ministers expect a market for lateral flow tests to develop, with individual tests expected to cost a few pounds. The scaling back of testing comes after Mr Johnson previously told the BBCÂ£2bn had been spent on the testing system in January alone. Mr Johnson said ""targeted vaccines and treatments"" would be in place for the most vulnerable, and the government would follow the recommendation of the UK's vaccine advisory body to offer an additional booster jabto the over-75s and the most vulnerable over-12sthis spring. He added the government would maintain its resilience to respond to resurgences from the virus, including by keeping the Office for National Statistics infection surveillance survey to keep track of surges when they happen. Ministers have taken an axe to testing - going further than many experts thought they should. A number had called for rapid lateral flow tests to be made available to older people, and those with health conditions, so they could get family and friends to use them before visiting. Instead, beyond social care staff, only those deemed at-risk will get access to tests in the community - and only then if they have symptoms. The at-risk group has not been defined, but is likely to be the most vulnerable who would benefit from antiviral treatments to reduce the risk of them needing hospital admission. This includes the severely immuno-compromised. A healthy 80-year-old would not qualify. These changes will come in on 1 April and by that stage infection levels could be at very low rates. The scaling back may not seem that significant if that is the case. But the big caveat is that the government will retain the ability to ramp testing back up if the circumstances demand it - either because infection rates take a turn for a worse, or a new variant emerges. Mr Johnson also promised that the UK government would continue to work with the devolved administrations of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland as they decided how to take forward their own plans. But Scottish health secretary Humza Yousaf said free tests and self-isolating when positive with Covid were effective tools in suppressing the virus and said the public health advice the Scottish government had received ""does not advise removing these important interventions at this time"". He called for the UK government to continue supplying ""adequate"" funding for all parts of the UK to do what they deemed necessary to tackle the virus. Northern Ireland's health minister Robin Swann said his department would ""carefully consider"" England's plan, but no decisions had been made on changes to his country's test and trace programme. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer described the PM's plan as a ""half-baked announcement from a government paralysed by chaos and incompetence"". He said the PM's strategy was not ""a plan to live well with Covid"" and would instead ""leave us vulnerable"". Dr Chaand Nagpaul, council chairman of the BMA, said the strategy neglected some of society's most vulnerable and instead of giving people more freedom, it was likely to cause ""more uncertainty and anxiety"". ""Living with Covid-19 must not mean ignoring the virus all together - which in many respects the government's plan in England seems to do,"" he said. Dr Nagpaul called for ""urgent clarity"" on testing for NHS workers to protect staff and patients and that ""protections must be maintained for the most vulnerable, including the provision of enhanced face masks, and clear guidance for both patients and clinicians"". Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers which represents hospital trusts, said many NHS figures were ""concerned about the potential impact of these decisions"" and it was ""vital"" the government was ready to restore phased out testing and surveillance systems should they be needed. Ministers should assess the impact of restricting access to free testing, he said, warning there was a risk of ""significantly exacerbating health inequalities"". The Blood Cancer UK charity accused the government of lifting restrictions ""without a plan to protect immunocompromised people"" and warned the move would leave many of them ""feeling abandoned"". It said that of the 500,000 severely immunocompromised people in the UK, about 230,000 have blood cancer. Plan B measures - introduced in December to stem the spread of the Omicron variant - including the requirement to wear masks in public places and the use of Covid passes for large events, were abolished in England last month. Face masks continue to be a condition of carriage on London's transport network, but London mayor Sadiq Khan said on Monday that he expected the rules would be lifted following the PM's announcement. Just over 91% of people in the UK aged 12 and over have had a first dose of a vaccine, 85% a second jab, and 66% a booster or a third dose,according to official data,external. On Monday, the UK recorded a further 38,409 confirmed daily cases and another 15 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test. An axe has been taken to testing - does it matter?

"Boris Johnson is due to set out his plans to scrap all remaining Covid legal restrictions in England, including the requirement to isolate. The BBC understands cabinet ministers have agreed to the PM's ""living with Covid plan"" after a delayed meeting. There were reports of tensions between the Treasury and the Department of Health over how parts of the plan will be funded. Some experts have urged caution and Labour queried plans to reduce testing. Mr Johnson is expected to update MPs in the Commons at about 16:30 GMT. The prime minister will then lead a televised No 10 news conference at 19:00 GMT alongside England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty, and Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK government's chief scientific adviser. Speaking before Monday's announcement, Mr Johnson said his plan would bring society ""towards a return to normality"". No 10 said the Covid vaccination programme had put England in a ""strong position to consider lifting the remaining legal restrictions"". It added that the plan for living with Covid would take a ""cautious approach"" retaining ""some surveillance systems and plans for contingency measures"". Johnson: Do not throw Covid caution to the wind How new drugs are finally taming the virus Queen tests positive for Covid The legal requirement to self-isolate for a fixed period after testing positive in England has been in place ever since mass testing was rolled out. Currently positive or asymptomatic peoplehave to isolate for up to 10 days,but can end their isolation earlier if they register negative lateral flow tests on both days five and six. Mr Johnson has said that Covid testing would take place at a ""much lower level"" afterrevealing Â£2bn was spent on the system in January alone. Community PCR testing for people with symptoms is expected to stop under the new plan, but it is unclear whether the availability of free lateral flow tests will be reduced. On the issue of changes to testing arrangements, a Welsh government spokesperson said any decision to alter them ""would be premature and reckless"". Earlier,Stormont ministers held talks with Michael Gove, minister for intergovernmental relations, about future funding to fight the Covid pandemic ahead of the PM's announcement. It follows a joint letter from Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford and Northern Ireland's Health Minister Robin Swann warning of the need to keep existing testing in place. Covid is no longer an exceptional threat. Despite the huge wave of infections, the numbers dying in recent months has been similar to what you would expect during a normal winter. Most agree some scaling back is warranted, but it needs to be done carefully. During the pandemic Â£37 billion has been set aside for test and trace. This is a huge sum - more than has been spent on GP care. Mass PCR testing in the community is almost certain to go. But these gold standard tests will be kept in hospitals to diagnose patients who are seriously ill and to keep an eye out on variants. Many believe the Office for National Statistics surveillance survey can be done on a smaller scale, but it is essential to have something to keep a check on how the virus is spreading. Read more analysishere. Prof Sir Andrew Pollard, who helped develop the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, told the BBC's Today programme that ""there isn't a right or wrong answer"" to when restrictions change. He said: ""If restrictions change this week, next week, or the week after, in six months' time the number of transmission events will likely be very similar."" He added that having a surveillance system - ""an early warning system"" - in place whenever restrictions are eased will be ""critical"". The government is expected to urge people to exercise their own judgement. But Prof Anthony Costello, professor of global health and sustainable development at UCL, told the BBC: ""The worry about lifting the legal restrictions is that we are telling not only our population, but the world, that there is really nothing to worry about, that it's all over when it isn't."" Just over 91% of people in the UK aged 12 and over have had a first dose of a vaccine, 85% a second jab, and 66% a booster or a third dose,according to official data,external, which has been collated daily since the vaccine rollout began in December 2020. The UK's vaccine advisory body has recommended thatan additional Covid booster vaccination should be offered to all adults over the age of 75 and the most vulnerable over-12sthis spring. England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales are set to accept the advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI). The government has announced it will offera low-dose Covid vaccine to children aged between five and 11 in England during April.Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland have also said they will be offering young children the same vaccine. The prime minister's announcement will come a day after Buckingham Palace revealedthe Queen, 95, had tested positive for Covid. This video can not be played Watch: Juliet Coffer, who been isolating for over 850 days, reacts to the prospect of no Covid restrictions The new Covid plans would also see councils in England become responsible for managing outbreaks using existing powers. The Office for National Statistics infection survey, which randomly tests a sample of the population, is also expected to be replaced with a slimmed down surveillance programme. On Sunday, the UK recorded another 25,696 new infections and a further 74 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test - although Sunday figures do tend to be among the lowest of any typical week. Amid concerns that payments for people off sick due to Covid will come to an end, Wes Streeting said ""now is not the time to start charging for tests or weaken sick pay"". He said he was ""particularly concerned"" about the end of free testing and described such a move as ""like being 2-1 up with 10 minutes left of play and subbing your best defender"". Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chair of the British Medical Association, said infections need to fall further before the rules were relaxed. ""It does appear as if the government is trying to pretend that Covid doesn't exist in the day-to-day lives of so many people,"" he told the BBC. This video can not be played Watch Boris Johnson's response when asked if it's too soon to end mandatory self-isolation when testing positive Several scientists and clinicians - including Prof Anthony Costello, Dr Kit Yates and Prof  Christina Pagel - have signedan open letter,externalto Sir Chris Whitty and Sir Patrick Vallance, urging them to ""clarify the extent to which the planned policies are consistent with scientific advice and what specifically that scientific advice contained"". Plan B measures - introduced in December to stem the spread of the Omicron variant - including the requirement to wear masks in public places and the use of Covid passes for large events, were abolished in England last month. Throughout the pandemic, England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have moved at different speeds in introducing or relaxing restrictions. In Northern Ireland, all remaining Covid measures - such as certificates in nightclubs, face coverings, and limits on gatherings in homes -stopped being legally binding on Tuesday. Wales is currently at alert level zero,its lowest level of Covid rules. In Scotland, legislation covering face coverings and vaccine passports had been due to expire next Monday but earlier this month ministers extended it for another six months.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson has announced the end of coronavirus restrictions in England All Covid restrictions will end in England on Thursday and free mass testing will stop from 1 April. The prime minister told MPs the legal duty to isolate for those who tested positive would be dropped as he unveiled his""living with Covid"" plan,external. From 1 April the provision of free testing would be targeted to the most vulnerable, Boris Johnson said. But the British Medical Association, a doctors' union, said the plan failed to protect those most at risk from Covid. And opposition parties said the prime minister's blueprint out of the pandemic had moved too fast, and voiced concern over the scaling back of free testing. The Scottish government said the public health advice it had received did not recommend lifting the restrictions. An axe has been taken to testing - does it matter? What is England's 'Living with Covid' plan? Spring Covid booster for over-75s and high risk Businesses warn against end of free Covid tests Speaking at a Downing Street news conference on Monday evening, Mr Johnson said ""today is not the day we can declare victory over Covid because this virus is not going away"". He described the pandemic as ""two of the darkest, grimmest years in our peacetime history"". However, he said the nation had passed the peak of Omicron, with falling cases and hospital admissions. And he said the country could now complete the ""transition back towards normality"" while retaining contingencies to respond to a Covid resurgence or a new variant. England's chief medical officer Prof Sir Chris Whitty said the ending of virus restrictions was a ""gradual, steady change over a period of time"", adding: ""This is not a sudden 'everything stops'."" He said the number of people being infected with Omicron was still ""very high"". Office for National Statistics (ONS) infection figures last week estimated that one in 20 people in England had Covid. Sir Chris said the public health advice for people with Covid would still be to self-isolate to prevent others catching it, as it would be for many other highly infectious diseases. Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK government's chief scientific adviser, warned the virus would continue to evolve over the next couple of years and there was no guarantee that future variants would be less severe than Omicron. He argued it was crucial the nation retained a virus surveillance system to monitor new threats and the capacity to ""ramp up"" measures again quickly to protect the vulnerable. From 21 February: the government is dropping guidance for staff and students in most education and childcare settings to undertake twice weekly asymptomatic testing From Thursday 24 February: People who test positive for Covid will no longer be legally required to self-isolate But they will still be advised to stay at home and avoid contact with others for at least five full days Routine contact tracing will end, so fully-vaccinated close contacts and those under 18 will no longer be legally required to test daily for seven days The Â£500 self-isolation support payment for people on low incomes who test positive for Covid will no longer be available Covid provisions for increased statutory sick pay will apply for a further month From 1 April: Free mass symptomatic and asymptomatic testing for the general public will end, and will instead be targeted towards the most vulnerable People with Covid symptoms will be asked to exercise personal responsibility when deciding whether to stay at home - until then they are still advised to do so Current government guidance on Covid passports will end and it will no longer recommend venues use the NHS Covid pass You can read more about the changes here Earlier, Mr Johnson told MPs it was time to move from government restrictions to people exercising personal responsibility. It was only because levels of immunity were so high and deaths were now ""below where you would normally expect for this time of year"" that the government could lift the restrictions, he said. As Omicron was less severe, testing for it ""on the colossal scale we've been doing"" was less important and less valuable in preventing serious illness, he added. Limited free lateral flow tests for the most vulnerable groups would still be provided, the PM said, and ministers would work with retailers to ensure everyone who wanted a test could buy one. The PM did not specify which groups of people would be deemed ""most vulnerable"". To prevent the stockpiling of free lateral flow tests before 1 April, people will only be able to order a box of tests every three days instead of every 24 hours. Once tests are no longer free, ministers expect a market for lateral flow tests to develop, with individual tests expected to cost a few pounds. The scaling back of testing comes after Mr Johnson previously told the BBCÂ£2bn had been spent on the testing system in January alone. Mr Johnson said ""targeted vaccines and treatments"" would be in place for the most vulnerable, and the government would follow the recommendation of the UK's vaccine advisory body to offer an additional booster jabto the over-75s and the most vulnerable over-12sthis spring. He added the government would maintain its resilience to respond to resurgences from the virus, including by keeping the Office for National Statistics infection surveillance survey to keep track of surges when they happen. Ministers have taken an axe to testing - going further than many experts thought they should. A number had called for rapid lateral flow tests to be made available to older people, and those with health conditions, so they could get family and friends to use them before visiting. Instead, beyond social care staff, only those deemed at-risk will get access to tests in the community - and only then if they have symptoms. The at-risk group has not been defined, but is likely to be the most vulnerable who would benefit from antiviral treatments to reduce the risk of them needing hospital admission. This includes the severely immuno-compromised. A healthy 80-year-old would not qualify. These changes will come in on 1 April and by that stage infection levels could be at very low rates. The scaling back may not seem that significant if that is the case. But the big caveat is that the government will retain the ability to ramp testing back up if the circumstances demand it - either because infection rates take a turn for a worse, or a new variant emerges. Mr Johnson also promised that the UK government would continue to work with the devolved administrations of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland as they decided how to take forward their own plans. But Scottish health secretary Humza Yousaf said free tests and self-isolating when positive with Covid were effective tools in suppressing the virus and said the public health advice the Scottish government had received ""does not advise removing these important interventions at this time"". He called for the UK government to continue supplying ""adequate"" funding for all parts of the UK to do what they deemed necessary to tackle the virus. Northern Ireland's health minister Robin Swann said his department would ""carefully consider"" England's plan, but no decisions had been made on changes to his country's test and trace programme. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer described the PM's plan as a ""half-baked announcement from a government paralysed by chaos and incompetence"". He said the PM's strategy was not ""a plan to live well with Covid"" and would instead ""leave us vulnerable"". Dr Chaand Nagpaul, council chairman of the BMA, said the strategy neglected some of society's most vulnerable and instead of giving people more freedom, it was likely to cause ""more uncertainty and anxiety"". ""Living with Covid-19 must not mean ignoring the virus all together - which in many respects the government's plan in England seems to do,"" he said. Dr Nagpaul called for ""urgent clarity"" on testing for NHS workers to protect staff and patients and that ""protections must be maintained for the most vulnerable, including the provision of enhanced face masks, and clear guidance for both patients and clinicians"". Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers which represents hospital trusts, said many NHS figures were ""concerned about the potential impact of these decisions"" and it was ""vital"" the government was ready to restore phased out testing and surveillance systems should they be needed. Ministers should assess the impact of restricting access to free testing, he said, warning there was a risk of ""significantly exacerbating health inequalities"". The Blood Cancer UK charity accused the government of lifting restrictions ""without a plan to protect immunocompromised people"" and warned the move would leave many of them ""feeling abandoned"". It said that of the 500,000 severely immunocompromised people in the UK, about 230,000 have blood cancer. Plan B measures - introduced in December to stem the spread of the Omicron variant - including the requirement to wear masks in public places and the use of Covid passes for large events, were abolished in England last month. Face masks continue to be a condition of carriage on London's transport network, but London mayor Sadiq Khan said on Monday that he expected the rules would be lifted following the PM's announcement. Just over 91% of people in the UK aged 12 and over have had a first dose of a vaccine, 85% a second jab, and 66% a booster or a third dose,according to official data,external. On Monday, the UK recorded a further 38,409 confirmed daily cases and another 15 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test. An axe has been taken to testing - does it matter?

"A shortage of homes being put up for sale has led to rising asking prices and frustration for buyers, two reports suggest. The average asking price for a property in Britain has risen by Â£7,785 in February compared with last month, property portal Rightmove said. This was the largest month-on-month rise for 20 years, it said. High-end estate agent Savills found buyers could also be affected by the rising cost of living. Spring is traditionally the busiest season for the housing market. Rightmove said high demand among buyers was being driven by those looking for more space and who were ready to move on from their first homes. City property, particularly in London, was more highly sought after than during the pandemic, with some workers being encouraged to return to theÂ office. The increase in demand has pushed the average asking price across Britain to a record Â£348,804, according to Rightmove. Rental costs jump as workers return to the office First-time buyers rise: 'I couldn't keep paying rent' This demand for properties was being frustrated, according to Savills, by a lack of homes on the market. Nearly two-thirds (65%) of potential buyers said the lack of available homes was having a severe effect on their ability to buy, according to a survey of people registering with the estate agent earlier this month. Stock shortages appeared to be particularly acutely felt at the top end of the market, with 94% of buyers with a budget of Â£1m or more reporting a lack of choice. Nearly half (48%) of potential buyers had been considering a move for more than a year, with half (50%) hoping to complete within the next six months. Frances Clacy, research analyst at Savills, said: ""The imbalance of supply and demand, coupled with existing high levels of property wealth, will continue to fuel price growth in the coming months, despite the recent (Bank of England) rate rises."" But she added that ""realistic pricing"" would become more important as the market felt the knock-on effects of the rising cost of living.

The Prince of Walespaid tribute,externalto his work for The Prince's Trust. Davesimply wrote,external: ""Thank you for everything. Words can't explain"" whileTracey said,externalhe was a ""legend"". Prince Charles was among the figures paying tribute to Jamal Edwards Edwards was the founder of SBTV, an online grime and rap music platform which helped launch the careers of artists like Dave, Ed Sheeran and Skepta. He first got into film-making after his parents gave him a video camera as a Christmas present when he was 15. Born in Luton and later moving to west London, he was appointed an MBE for services to music in 2014. A pioneering figure in British rap and grime music, Edwards attended the Brit Awards earlier this month, and was understood to have performed as a DJ at a gig in north London on Saturday night. His company confirmed his death to the BBC on Sunday, saying he died that morning. His mother said he ""passed away after a sudden illness"". Allow Twitter content?

'Every young guy wanted to do what Jamal was doing' I May Destroy You starMichaela Coel said,external: ""May his passion, joy and relentless desire to platform British artists be an inspiration."" Former prime minister David Cameron, who is chair of the National Citizen Service's Board of Patrons,paid tribute,externalto Edwards for ""supporting and inspiring young people to be the best they could be, leading from the front and showing what's possible with hard work and determination"". London Mayor Sadiq Khantweeted,externalthat British music and entertainment ""has lost one of its brightest stars"", while Chelsea Football Clubadded,externalthat Edwards - a Chelsea fan - was ""an inspiration to many, we're honoured that he was part of our Chelsea family"". In 2019, he directed theChelsea FC remix video,externalof grime artist Capo Lee's Style and Swag, and the video featured several of the team's players. It's impossible to overstate how important Jamal Edwards was to British rap. His YouTube channel, which was started ""on a Â£20 phone"" while he was still at school, has given early exposure to almost every key player in the game. Stormzy, Skepta, JME, J Hus, Lady Leshurr, Dave, AJ Tracey, Krept & Konan, Headie Oneâ¦ the list is endless. To an extent, SBTV was formed out of frustration. ""Everyone in my area was an MC and I remember thinking, 'Why can't I find these online? I'm going to film people in my area and upload it to Youtube',""Edwards told BBC Radio 1Xtra in 2017,external. ""And from there it just started building and growing."" SBTV arrived at a crucial time, showing that grime could thrive online, while police were attempting to shut down gigs with the controversial risk-assessment form 696. The channel's success meant Edwards became known as an entrepreneur and businessman - but he was a reluctant frontman. ""I wanted to be the Banksy,"" he said. ""I wanted no-one to know who I was."" That changed in 2011, when he featured in an advert for Google Chrome. His name was searched more than a million times. and people started approaching him for selfies. But he put his fame to good use - raising awareness of mental health, funding youth centres and encouraging other young entrepreneurs. Music remained his true passion, though, and he never stopped supporting the artists he loved. As recently as December, he encouraged Ed Sheeran to record a new verse for a song he'd discovered by Nigerian artist Fireboy DML. That track,Peru,external, climbed to number two in the UK charts, giving the African star his first international hit. Edwards took no credit - he never did - but hundreds of artists have similar stories. His loss will be felt throughout the UK music scene. BBC 1Xtra DJ and presenter Nadia Jae told Newsbeat that Edwards ""helped me with my career"", adding: ""He's helped so many people, put them in places that they never would have been and did a lot of the pushing of doors to make sure that our industry is as fruitful as it is now."" She added: ""He had a heart of gold, I don't know anyone who has a bad word to say about Jamal. ""He broke so many barriers, I don't know if we're ever going to get another Jamal.""

"Boris Johnson is due to set out his plans to scrap all remaining Covid legal restrictions in England, including the requirement to isolate. The BBC understands cabinet ministers have agreed to the PM's ""living with Covid plan"" after a delayed meeting. There were reports of tensions between the Treasury and the Department of Health over how parts of the plan will be funded. Some experts have urged caution and Labour queried plans to reduce testing. Mr Johnson is expected to update MPs in the Commons at about 16:30 GMT. The prime minister will then lead a televised No 10 news conference at 19:00 GMT alongside England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty, and Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK government's chief scientific adviser. Speaking before Monday's announcement, Mr Johnson said his plan would bring society ""towards a return to normality"". No 10 said the Covid vaccination programme had put England in a ""strong position to consider lifting the remaining legal restrictions"". It added that the plan for living with Covid would take a ""cautious approach"" retaining ""some surveillance systems and plans for contingency measures"". Johnson: Do not throw Covid caution to the wind How new drugs are finally taming the virus Queen tests positive for Covid The legal requirement to self-isolate for a fixed period after testing positive in England has been in place ever since mass testing was rolled out. Currently positive or asymptomatic peoplehave to isolate for up to 10 days,but can end their isolation earlier if they register negative lateral flow tests on both days five and six. Mr Johnson has said that Covid testing would take place at a ""much lower level"" afterrevealing Â£2bn was spent on the system in January alone. Community PCR testing for people with symptoms is expected to stop under the new plan, but it is unclear whether the availability of free lateral flow tests will be reduced. On the issue of changes to testing arrangements, a Welsh government spokesperson said any decision to alter them ""would be premature and reckless"". Earlier,Stormont ministers held talks with Michael Gove, minister for intergovernmental relations, about future funding to fight the Covid pandemic ahead of the PM's announcement. It follows a joint letter from Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford and Northern Ireland's Health Minister Robin Swann warning of the need to keep existing testing in place. Covid is no longer an exceptional threat. Despite the huge wave of infections, the numbers dying in recent months has been similar to what you would expect during a normal winter. Most agree some scaling back is warranted, but it needs to be done carefully. During the pandemic Â£37 billion has been set aside for test and trace. This is a huge sum - more than has been spent on GP care. Mass PCR testing in the community is almost certain to go. But these gold standard tests will be kept in hospitals to diagnose patients who are seriously ill and to keep an eye out on variants. Many believe the Office for National Statistics surveillance survey can be done on a smaller scale, but it is essential to have something to keep a check on how the virus is spreading. Read more analysishere. Prof Sir Andrew Pollard, who helped develop the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, told the BBC's Today programme that ""there isn't a right or wrong answer"" to when restrictions change. He said: ""If restrictions change this week, next week, or the week after, in six months' time the number of transmission events will likely be very similar."" He added that having a surveillance system - ""an early warning system"" - in place whenever restrictions are eased will be ""critical"". The government is expected to urge people to exercise their own judgement. But Prof Anthony Costello, professor of global health and sustainable development at UCL, told the BBC: ""The worry about lifting the legal restrictions is that we are telling not only our population, but the world, that there is really nothing to worry about, that it's all over when it isn't."" Just over 91% of people in the UK aged 12 and over have had a first dose of a vaccine, 85% a second jab, and 66% a booster or a third dose,according to official data,external, which has been collated daily since the vaccine rollout began in December 2020. The UK's vaccine advisory body has recommended thatan additional Covid booster vaccination should be offered to all adults over the age of 75 and the most vulnerable over-12sthis spring. England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales are set to accept the advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI). The government has announced it will offera low-dose Covid vaccine to children aged between five and 11 in England during April.Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland have also said they will be offering young children the same vaccine. The prime minister's announcement will come a day after Buckingham Palace revealedthe Queen, 95, had tested positive for Covid. This video can not be played Watch: Juliet Coffer, who been isolating for over 850 days, reacts to the prospect of no Covid restrictions The new Covid plans would also see councils in England become responsible for managing outbreaks using existing powers. The Office for National Statistics infection survey, which randomly tests a sample of the population, is also expected to be replaced with a slimmed down surveillance programme. On Sunday, the UK recorded another 25,696 new infections and a further 74 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test - although Sunday figures do tend to be among the lowest of any typical week. Amid concerns that payments for people off sick due to Covid will come to an end, Wes Streeting said ""now is not the time to start charging for tests or weaken sick pay"". He said he was ""particularly concerned"" about the end of free testing and described such a move as ""like being 2-1 up with 10 minutes left of play and subbing your best defender"". Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chair of the British Medical Association, said infections need to fall further before the rules were relaxed. ""It does appear as if the government is trying to pretend that Covid doesn't exist in the day-to-day lives of so many people,"" he told the BBC.

"Russian forces launch a full-scale assault on Ukraine, with its military attacking the country from the north, east and south Ukrainian President Zelensky says 137 Ukrainian citizens - both soldiers and civilians - died on Thursday People in the capital, Kyiv, and elsewhere are trying to flee - some 100,000 have left so far, the UN says There are also renewed reports of explosions in the port city of Mariupol, home to half a million people Russians seize control of the Chernobyl complex - site of the world's worst nuclear disaster UK and US announce fresh new sanctions on Russia, including asset freezes on banks President Vladimir Putin defends his move, saying there was no other way to defend Russia But US President Joe Biden says Putin's aggression will cost Russia dearly Edited by Jude Sheerin For technical reasons too boring to explain, we are switching our live coverageto a new webpage here. For all the latest developments on the conflict, please follow us to the new link. President Joe Biden and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz have both said that cutting Russia off from the global banking system, Swift, is not being proposed right now. But what would happen if it was? Excluding Russia from Swift would risk severe repercussions for banks that are owed
money  - either now or in the longer term. This is particularly true in Germany, which has deep financial ties with Russia and feels it has done its share of economic sacrifice by suspending certification of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Although being de-Swifted would be disruptive for Russia, there is an alternate system - called CFPS - that Russia set up after it annexed Crimea in 2014. Similarly, China has also set up a secondary system, CIPS. Expelling Russia would probably only push it closer to China and play into the hands of the Xi administration, which is keen to ""de-dollarise"" the world's financial architecture. This would accelerate that trend and ambition. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky reportedly just said ""the enemy has designated me as the target number one, and my family as the target number two"". In a video address carried by Ukrainian media, Zelensky says he is staying in the capital Kyiv's ""government quarters"" and his family is also in Ukraine. He did not provide further details. Zelensky also warns that Ukrainian officials now have ""information that enemy sabotage groups have entered Kyiv"". The president did not elaborate on what those groups might be. More on the situation at Chernobyl tonight: White House press secretary Jen Psaki just told reporters at her daily briefing that there are reports Russian soldiers are holding the staff of the Ukrainian nuclear site hostage. ""We are outraged by credible reports that Russian soldiers are currently holding the staff of the Chernobyl facilities hostage,"" she said. ""This unlawful and dangerous hostage-taking, which could upend the routine civil service efforts required to maintain and protect the nuclear waste facilities, is obviously incredibly alarming and gravely concerning. ""We condemn it and we request their release."" Read more on this here. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson told his government on Thursday evening that Ukrainian soldiers have been putting up a fight, tweets the BBC's political correspondent Iain Watson.

Russian forces have taken control of Chernobyl, site of the 1986 nuclear disaster and a place that remains radioactive to this day - prompting significant concern from international nuclear watchdogs. Prof Claire Corkhill, nuclear materials expert at Sheffield University, told the BBC about the dangers of military clashes taking place near the site. âThis is not a place to have ammunition flying around,"" she said. The Chernobyl site contains several nuclear waste containment facilities - including the ânew safe confinementâ - the protective dome that covers the reactor that was so badly damaged by the infamous 1986 explosion. âThese buildings are designed to keep radioactive materials inside, but theyâre not necessarily armoured; theyâre not designed to operate in a war zone,â she said. Prof Corkhill said that although piercing one of these structures  wouldnât necessarily cause a repeat of the Chernobyl disaster - where plumes of radioactive material dispersed across Europe - it could âset us back 30 years in terms of the work that has been done clearing up the siteâ. It could release and disperse radioactive material in the local area, she said. Chris MorrisBBC Reality Check The Nord Stream 2 pipeline that would bring gas to Germany has shuttered amid the latest fighting There was plenty of criticism that Western sanctions in the days leading up to this invasion did not go far enough, fast enough. These new measures will hit the Russian economy much harder. But there are still potential gaps. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said sanctions against major Russian banks include one of the largest state banks, VTB, which will have all its assets frozen. But another major bank, Sberbank, was not mentioned. And the Ukrainian government wanted more â in particular moves to disconnect Russia from the international payment system known as Swift, which thousands of banks use to exchange information. The US and the UK are in favour of such a move, but some European countries fear it could damage their own banks. Suspending Russia from Swift is still under consideration, but the hesitation is a reminder that in a globalised world all sanctions tend to have an impact on the countries imposing them as well. And the real trouble with sanctions is that they donât work quickly. They do increase pressure, and they can do damage. But the international community is not trying to damage the Russian economy just for the sake of doing so. It wants economic pressure to force a change in Putinâs political and military calculations. Meanwhile, the invasion of Ukraine continues. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has just signed a decree ordering a general mobilisation. All Ukrainians who can carry arms have been urged to defend their homeland. The country's conscripts and reservists are also being called up, according to the decree, which is to be in effect for 90 days. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says 137 Ukrainian citizens - both soldiers and civilians - died on Thursday, the first day of a massive Russian military assault. Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News The head of Britain's MI6 has tweeted about intelligence on Ukraine. âUS and UK
intelligence communities uncovered Putinâs plans for Ukraine. We exposed his
attempts to engineer âfalse flagâ, fake attacks to justify his invasion. We
revealed his plans to assassinate Ukrainian leaders and senior officials,â
Richard Moore, also known as ""C"", said in a tweet. âThis attack was long
planned, unprovoked, cruel aggression. No amount of Russian disinformation will
now disguise that fact from the international community,"" wrote the Secret Intelligence Service chief. US and UK intelligence seem to have had an unusual and highly
accurate level of insight into Putinâs plans and strategy. The unprecedented
publicising of some of that intelligence has had tactical success in partly disrupting Putinâs plans - including for provocations and false flags. It may have also helped draw Western countries closer together. But even this
level of insight couldnât provide a way of stopping or deterring him. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Long queues have been seen at bus and train station in the capital Kyiv, as people have been desperately trying to go western regions of Ukraine All Ukrainian men aged between 18 to 60 are now banned from leaving the country, Ukraine's state border guard service (DPSA) says. It adds the measure is aimed at ""guaranteeing Ukraine's defence and the organisation of timely mobilisation"". The temporary ban will remain in force for the duration of martial law declared on Thursday morning. Steve RosenbergBBC Moscow Correspondent I think Vladimir Putin is fuelled by resentment at how the Cold War ended, with the West declaring victory and Russia losing power, influence and territory. I think he's also motivated by an almost semi-religious belief that Ukraine must be with Russia, must be in Russia's orbit, and Russia as a great power has the right to its own sphere of influence. I also think he has disdain for the West and Western leaders, whom he deems weak and disunited. What can the West do about this? Itâs very difficult to say. I think the Kremlin would've factored in sanctions. The Kremlin will know that the US will not put boots on the ground in Ukraine. The West does not want a war with Russia and Russia knows that. But I would say this. If youâve been in power for 22 years, as Putin has, you start to feel invincible, you start to think you canât put a foot wrong, that youâre Teflon. And that's when mistakes start to creep in. Just from speaking to people on the streets and witnessing the strength of feeling against this offensive, I wonder whether this Russian invasion will turn out to be Putin's fatal error. Countless city residents are hunkered in subways to avoid potential fighting Countless Kyiv residents are sleeping in underground metro stations as midnight approaches in Ukraine. The people - some of whom have brought their pets, extension cords and even air mattresses - are mostly calm, according to one evacuee. The place is ""not too crowded, most people are scrolling their phones, trying to catch the latest news"", says Oksana Potapova. ""We seem settled enough to spend the night here,"" she wrote on Facebook. ""And given the news about heavy fighting near Kyiv, the takeover of Chernobyl power plant, and forecasts of possible attacks on Kyiv, it seems like a good decision."" Paul AdamsBBC diplomatic correspondent A new iron curtain is falling
across Europe. Thatâs what this countryâs
beleaguered president, Volodymyr Zelensky, said in his most recent televised
statement. The echoes of Winston
Churchillâs famous 1946 speech in Fulton, Missouri were powerful. âFrom Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the
Adriatic, an iron curtain has descended across the continent,â Churchill told
his audience back then. Todayâs iron curtain has moved eastwards,
meandering from the Gulf of Finland, around Belarus and along Ukraineâs eastern
border and on down to the Black Sea. That, Zelensky says, is where it should stay, with
Ukraine firmly on the west. But that conviction feels like a fragile,
disappearing dream tonight, as Russian armour cuts deep into Ukrainian
territory, with the prospect of worse to come. With savage ferocity, Vladimir Putin has reached
out, grabbed Ukraine by the scruff of the neck and is trying, by force of arms,
to drag this hopeful nation back across the fence. Night has fallen and a curfew is in effect in Kyiv after the first full day of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. If you're just joining us, or catching up on events, here's what's been going on:  If you want more detail, you can read our guide to the conflict, and how it has unfolded today, byclicking here. Ilya BarabanovBBC Russian Service, Kyiv Smoke rises in the background as people walk down a street near the airfield All day long the Russian troops have been trying to take over an airfield at Hostomel, on the northern outskirts of the Ukrainian capital. This airfield is of strategic importance: if captured it could become a springboard for the Russian army into Kyiv. Judging from verified videos, at least two Russian helicopters were shot down over it. Journalists from CNN filmed a group of Russian paratroopers landing there while the Bellingcat investigative website said it had intelligence that 18 war planes with reinforcements were heading towards it from Russia. Later in the evening it became clear that a heavy battle for Hostomel was raging and Ukrainian forces were using both airstrikes and artillery. By 11pm Kyiv time (21:00 GMT) an official statement was released, saying that the airfield was back in the Ukrainian hands. A protester is detained in Saint Petersburg More than 1,700 people have been arrested during anti-war protests across dozens of cities in Russia, an independent monitor reports. More than 900 were arrested in Moscow and over 400 in Saint Petersburg, according to OVD-Info, which tracks arrests at opposition rallies. Thousands gathered near Pushkin Square in central Moscow, while up to 1,000 people gathered in the former imperial capital Saint Petersburg, the AFP news agency reports. Many held Ukrainian flags in Moscow ""No to war"" was spray-painted on the front gate of the Russian parliament's lower house. ""I am in shock. My relatives and loved ones live in Ukraine,"" Anastasia Nestulya, 23, told AFP in Moscow. ""What can I tell them over the phone? You hang in there?"" Navalny (standing) while on trial from prison Jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny - on trial in a Moscow prison -  has accused Vladimir Putin of using the invasion of Ukraine to cover up Russian corruption. In a video published by independent news outlet Dozhd, Navalny is heard expressing his opposition to the invasion of Ukraine. Wearing a prison uniform, he says it would lead to a ""huge number of victims, destroyed futures and the continuation of this line of impoverishment of the citizens of Russia"". This war between Russia and Ukraine was unleashed to cover up the theft from Russian citizens and divert their attention from problems that exist inside the country. Alexei Navalny Navalny has been jailed for over a year on old fraud charges, after surviving a poison attack, which he and the West say was carried out by the Kremlin. He is being tried inside the maximum security prison on new charges that could see his imprisonment extended by a decade. Vladimir Putin has spoken by phone to French President Emmanuel Macron and given him an ""exhaustive"" explanation of the reasons for
Russia's actions in Ukraine, the Kremlin says. Macron requested the call and they agreed to stay in contact, the Kremlin says. In France, the Elysee Palace says Macron spoke first to Ukraine's President Zelensky. He then spoke to President Putin and demanded an end to military operations and warned of massive sanctions. The French president has attempted to avert a Russian invasion in recent weeks, including holding talks
with Putin in the Kremlin. Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva The UN Refugee Agency warned today of a rapidly deteriorating situation in Ukraine as people flee their homes looking for safety. UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, warned ""the humanitarian consequences on civilian populations will be devastating. There are no winners in war but countless lives will be torn apart"". The refugee agency is calling on Ukraineâs neighbours to keep their borders open to those fleeing and says it stands ready to ""support efforts by all to respond to any situation of forced displacement"". Meanwhile, the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Peter Maurer, called on those fighting to respect international law, and to ensure civilians were protected. The UN had already issued a record appeal for funding in 2022 to relieve crises in Syria, Yemen, Afghanistan, and the drought-ridden Sahel region in Africa. A further major conflict and refugee crisis in the middle of Europe could stretch its resources well beyond their limits. Â© 2025 BBC.

"A British Airways plane struggled with high winds on its approach to Heathrow on Friday British Airways has said continuous high winds over the last few days have made it difficult to unload baggage from its planes. The airline said stormy weather made opening the luggage hold of aircraft hard, and passengers had faced delays getting their bags after landing. It has also struggled to land and restock its planes on time, affecting inbound and outbound plane movements. BA apologised for ""letting people down"". It added that items of machinery needed to offload bags could not be be operated in high winds. Machinery such as scissor lifts, that are needed to load catering trucks on to aircraft, also cannot be used because of the danger they pose. The high winds of Storm Eunice on Friday and Storm Franklin on Monday have delayed many flights because of the difficulties landing aircraft. BA said every time a flight could not land, it had to circle above the airport and then try again. But every time this happened it caused further delays to flights due to leave in the following hours. It also said some staff had not been able to get to work because of the storms. Richard Sams and his partner Lindsay It took Richard Sams, 40, and his partner Lindsay, 36, six hours on Sunday to collect their luggage at Heathrow and leave the airport. That was after a 17-hour journey back from Mexico via Austin in Texas. ""BA just didn't seem to know what to do, it was immensely frustrating,"" Mr Sams tells the BBC. He says it took them just over an hour to get off the plane because of the high winds. Then, when they reached the baggage reclaim hall they found ""thousands of people"" waiting for their luggage, some who had been there for up to five hours. ""We were told we could go home and have our bags returned to us within seven days, but we decided to wait it out,"" Mr Sams says. ""We had access to water but no food other than a chocolate from a vending machine."" The couple got their bags at 4:05pm - six hours after they had landed - and then headed home. British Airways said: ""We are extremely sorry to all our customers who have been disrupted during the extreme weather conditions in the last few days. ""We know we have let people down, and that isn't good enough, but can reassure our customers that we are doing absolutely everything we can to improve the situation."" It said it was operating the vast majority of flights as planned but, due to bad weather in the UK and Europe, it was still experiencing some disruption and had been forced to cancel or delay a number of flights. The airline added that it was ""working round the clock"" to reunite passengers with their luggage. Customers due to travel on short-haul services on Monday can rebook flights for free, it said, while those whose flights have been cancelled can get a full refund. Heathrow is not the only airport being affected by high winds. Since Friday, more than 850 flights have been cancelled across the UK, according to data company Cirium. This number covers flights in and out of the UK, plus domestic services. Cirium said 507 of the cancellations were on Friday. There were 42 on Saturday and 181 on Sunday. As of midday on Monday, 122 flights have been cancelled. This video can not be played ""Easy, easy... OK, tippy-toe!""

"This video can not be played Louis Sainsbury has been stuck in institutional units for years Significantly fewer people with learning disabilities will be stuck far from home or in hospitals by March 2024, Scottish ministers have pledged. It follows a report,externallooking at why people with complex needs were in out-of-area placements and had inappropriate long stays in hospital. It recommended a new national register of those with learning disabilities stuck in hospitals. And a national oversight panel to hold local authorities to account. Mental Wellbeing Minister Kevin Stewart said it was ""completely unacceptable"" that people were spending time in hospitals or other care settings when they were medically fit for discharge. ""This is not going to be an easy task but we have a collective responsibility to take action,"" he said. Mothers say autistic sons locked in psychiatric units Learning disabilities 'transformation' call Learning disabilities care 'far from home' Dozens of people with learning disabilities and complex needs are recorded as delayed discharges from hospital in Scotland. They can often be stuck for many years in a hospital or care institution when they ought to be discharged to live in the community. The numbers for those with autism or learning disabilities who are held out of their local area are not routinely recorded. The Scottish government's own adviser told the BBC many of them had been ""forgotten"" or ""lost"" in the system. One example highlighted in the working group report was Louis Sainsbury. Louis and Kate Sainsbury are trying to move to a new arrangement in Perthshire Louis developed meningitis when he was four days old. As a result his speech is impaired and he has learning disabilities. His mother Kate Sainsbury said he had been stuck in an institutional unit for years. At one point he was hundreds of miles from home in Hartlepool. ""I don't want to dwell on the bad times but some of those bad times were horrible,"" she said. ""It has been a four-year nightmare trying to get my son quality care in his own home. And we are not at the end of the road. This is just the beginning."" Louis is now in the process of getting out of the locked hospital unit where he's been for more than three years - spending half his week in Perthshire, getting used to his new house and new care team. ""Transition is really crucial,"" Kate told the BBC. ""You have got to be able to build relationships with the people who are going to go forward in looking after somebody who is currently in hospital and you have got to fund that so there has got to be funding for the hospital placement and the care team."" She said collaboration was crucial too and where there was a parent involved their expertise had to be recognised. Louis' story is highlighted in the report, which recommends a national register for people with learning disabilities stuck behind locked doors and a national panel to monitor their release. Earlier this month,BBC Scotland highlighted the plight of three motherswhose sons have been stuck in hospital units for years. Kate Sainsbury said that what they had created in Perthshire for Louis was one example of how things could be done differently, but it needed committed staff and resources to succeed. Louis' new home was part-funded through a medical negligence award. His care is funded by the local authority and his disability allowance. Dr Anne Macdonald said people had been ""lost"" in the system Mental Wellbeing Minister Kevin Stewart said: ""For every day spent unnecessarily in hospital, a person loses part of their connection with their community, their family, and their friends. ""We are not protecting the rights of people with learning disabilities and complex needs if they remain in hospital when they should be living at home, or in a homely environment with the right support. ""The recommendations are key to achieving our mission to significantly reduce delayed discharge and inappropriate out-of-area placements for adults with learning disabilities and complex care needs by March 2024. ""Visibility and accountability are critical."" Scottish government professional adviser on learning disabilities, Dr Anne Macdonald, said she was delighted ministers had agreed to action the recommendations in the report. In the past she said people had been ""lost"" in the system, ""forgotten about"" for years, often hundreds of miles from home. She said for people with complex needs living a full life in the community near family was a ""human right"". ""In that sense I believe it is non-negotiable,"" she said. ""This is something we have to address. The right services and the right support don't have to be expensive."" Jan Savage, Enable Scotland director, said: ""This is a landmark moment for the human rights of people who have a learning disability in Scotland. But the day for real celebration will be the day we know that no-one is still stuck in hospital or living in communities where they don't want to be. ""Our member-led My Own Front Door campaign called for urgent action. Today - nine years after this was identified as a priority by the Scottish government - we now finally have a deadline for change by March 2024 to end this human rights scandal."" Councillor Stuart Currie, Cosla's health and social care spokesman, said that developing and maintaining ""good, sustainable accommodation and support services"" was crucial to meeting the aspirations of the report and of those inappropriately-delayed in hospital beds or in accommodation away from their local area. ""Achieving this requires co-ordinated effort and investment in local support, which is something Cosla fully endorses,"" he added.

"At a news conference, Boris Johnson says he is not declaring victory over Covid, after announcing end to all restrictions in England He defends scrapping free tests from 1 April, saying vulnerable people will continue to have access to them The budget for the testing programme was bigger than that of the Home Office last year, he adds From Thursday, people with a positive test will no longer need to self-isolate but will still be advised to stay at home Other nations have different rules: N Ireland has scrapped all restrictions, Wales is at alert level zero, and Scotland has eased rules but some remain England's Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty says the number of people in hospital with Covid - more than 11,000 in the UK - remains significant but is falling Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says that it looks like, for Johnson, living with Covid ""means ignoring it"" People most vulnerable to Covid will be offered an additional booster vaccine from the spring Edited by Owen Amos That brings to an end our rolling coverage of today's Covid news. You can read our main story on the end of legal restrictions in England on Thursday - and the end of free mass testing in April -here. Todayâs live page was written by Becky Morton, Joshua Nevett, Doug Faulkner, Justin Parkinson and Lauren Turner. It was edited by Claire Heald, Owen Amos and Kevin Ponniah. Many thanks for reading. Boris Johnson, Sir Patrick Vallance, and Sir Chris Whitty spent almost an hour giving statements and answering questions. Here are the main points: Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent Compared to previous variants, Omicron hasn't proved deadly for as many people. And testing is hugely expensive. Governments all over the world will have to take this decision at some point. But make no mistake - this is going down very well with Boris Johnson's backbenchers, at just the point that they hold his fate in their hands like never before. The leading voice in the Covid Recovery Group of Conservative MPs Mark Harper joked that it sounded like the PM was joining their number - a collection of backbenchers sceptical about some of the restrictions. It far from guarantees Boris Johnson's survival when the partygate rows flare up again. But it won't do him any harm. The scientists are asked whether there is a danger of giving the public mixed messages by ending self-isolation and universal free Covid testing. Prof Whitty says public health messaging is much more difficult when there is a ""transition"" but we have to accept we need to ""change the way we think about things"". He stresses that mandation is an issue for politicians and separate to public health advice. And with that final question the news conference ends - and Johnson says he is off to speak to the president of Ukraine about the ongoing crisis. The prime minister is asked whether scrapping universal free tests will add to the cost of living crisis. In response, Johnson says the change to the testing regime won't come through for a few weeks, by which point the government hopes and expects incidence of Covid will have further declined, so the impact on people will be minimal. He adds that having a strong economy is the ""single best protection"" against the cost of living crisis - and this would not have been possible if the government hadn't opened up the economy last summer. Asked whether it is hypocritical for him to ask people to take personal responsibility when he is under police investigation for breaking lockdown rules, Johnson says he cannot comment on these allegations. When asked if it's worth continuing to take regular Covid tests, Prof Whitty outlines three situations in which it might be sensible. The first, he says, is ""how common is Covid at the moment"". ""If itâs very high, absolutely, that increases probability,"" Whitty says. The second factor is the ""environment you're in"". ""If youâre in a crowded environment, absolutely,"" he says. And a test would be necessary before ""mixing with vulnerable people"", Whitty says. ""This is about minimising the risk to other people,"" he says.  This video can not be played Boris Johnson hails 'moment of pride for our nation'  This video can not be played Covid: Chris Whitty urges people to continue to self-isolate if positive Boris Johnson is asked what his message is to those who are reluctant to return to their workplace. He says he has always been a believer in the importance of people getting into work, particularly for younger people. ""I would encourage people to get back to work with confidence,"" he says. The scientists are asked whether they are more anxious than confident about restrictions being dropped. Sir Chris Whitty says he is neither anxious nor confident but instead hopes ""we can go steadily in the right direction"". Sir Patrick Vallance adds: ""The one thing this virus has taught you is not to be cocky"" - saying the country needs to go carefully and be ready to react. The prime minister says people shouldn't think there's a ""division between gung-ho politicians and cautious, anxious scientists"". He adds that Covid has not gone away and there will likely be another variant ""that will cause us trouble"" - although he says vaccines and therapeutics put us in a better position to tackle this. Next, ITV Newsâs political editor Robert Peston asks a question about the end of Covid isolation. Peston asks Johnson if he would voluntarily quarantine if he tested positive for the virus after the requirement to self-isolate is lifted after 1 April. The PM says he will âexercise restraint and responsibilityâ to avoid infecting other people. Now onto questions from journalists. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg asks about ending mass testing - and whether the other UK nations will have to follow England's lead. Boris Johnson says ending testing in April can only be done because of the high levels of immunity and relative weakness of Omicron - but says that the government will make sure vulnerable people continue to have access to free tests. He says that we will continue to invest in surveillance, pointing to the ONS survey which will keep going. ""We want to have the keenest eyes in the crow's nest to watch for an iceberg in the form of a new variant,"" he says. Prof Chris Whitty says there are three reasons for testing - surveillance, to guide clinical treatment and for control - the last of which is what is being scaled back. Johnson is also asked about Russian President Vladimir Putin recognising breakaway republics in Ukraine and describes it as a ""dark omen"". You can read our live coverage on the ongoing crisishere. Gemma, from Greater London, asks what the advice is for pregnant women like herself and other people who are more vulnerable to Covid. Have they effectively been told to stay inside? she asks. No, is Boris Johnson's response - but he says everybody who is vulnerable should be treated with the ""utmost consideration"". ""If weâre symptomatic with any disease you should treat vulnerable people with courtesy and avoid spreading it,"" he says. Clinically vulnerable people will also continue to have access to tests and any therapeutics they need, the prime minister says. Sir Chris Whitty adds that it is now really clear that vaccination in pregnancy is a very
good thing for both the mother and her baby - and he urges pregnant women to get vaccinated. Now to the Q&A session, beginning with members of the public. First to ask a question is Nicole from the West Midlands. She says it appears that hospitalisations are at a similar level to that seen in October last year. âShould we put in place more measures to protect NHS?â she asks. Johnson is first to reply. The big difference between then and now is the number of hospitalisations is on a ""clear downward trend,"" he says. ""Youâll have seen the fatality numbers, which are different to what weâve seen in previous waves."" He says high level of vaccine immunity has allowed the restrictions to be lifted. Urging the public to continue to be cautious, Sir Patrick finishes by quoting an American colleague, who says: ""You can celebrate when the sun's shining - but take your umbrella with you."" Sir Patrick says it is absolutely essential to have a good surveillance system to detect new variants. The second thing that is important is to be able to respond quickly, he says, pointing at how quickly Omicron took off. He says it is important to be able to ramp up systems to respond quickly to new threats. There is also a section of the population which is vulnerable at all itimes, he adds, and says it is important to protect them. ""Detect, respond and protect the most vulnerable is absolutely crucial during a period of reducing the measures that are in place,"" he says. Sir Patrick Vallance begins to speak - he says the virus will continue to evolve quite quickly, probably for the next couple of years. And there is no guarantee that the next variant will be of the same reduced severity as Omicron, he says. We expect there to be further variants and they could be more severe, he adds. Prof Whitty says that excess mortality is actually lower than you might expect on average at this time of year, compared with the years before the pandemic. He says the impact on overall mortality has been ""much more muted"" and is ""essentially not visible"" compared to the previous waves of coronavirus. But he says the Omicron wave is still high, with some places in the UK having one in 20 to one in 25 people having the infection, according to ONS data. On the changes to the rules, Whitty says this is a steady move over a period of time as the rates are going down. ""This is not a sudden everything stops,"" he says. Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent There are two big reasons why the government has decided to act now in getting rid of the remaining coronavirus laws in England. The first is the current picture: Omicron has proved to be very mild in terms of the number of people it is killing. To use the technical term, there haven't been any excess deaths as a result of it, or, as Prof Chris Whitty has just put it, ""the total number of deaths is slightly lower than the seasonal average at this time of year"". The second is cost: the prime minister has said the test, trace and isolation budget in the 2020/21 financial year exceeded the entire budget of the Home Office. It has cost a further Â£15.7bn in this financial year - from last April until now - and a another Â£2bn in January of this year alone. England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, is now taking us through the latest data. He says the number of people in hospital with Covid in the UK is ""still significant"" and this is still putting quite a lot of pressure on many hospitals. However, he says the rates ""have been going down steadily now for some
weeks"". Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.99999845
"Boris Johnson is due to set out his plans to scrap all remaining Covid legal restrictions in England, including the requirement to isolate. The BBC understands cabinet ministers have agreed to the PM's ""living with Covid plan"" after a delayed meeting. There were reports of tensions between the Treasury and the Department of Health over how parts of the plan will be funded. Some experts have urged caution and Labour queried plans to reduce testing. Mr Johnson is expected to update MPs in the Commons at about 16:30 GMT. The prime minister will then lead a televised No 10 news conference at 19:00 GMT alongside England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty, and Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK government's chief scientific adviser. Speaking before Monday's announcement, Mr Johnson said his plan would bring society ""towards a return to normality"". No 10 said the Covid vaccination programme had put England in a ""strong position to consider lifting the remaining legal restrictions"". It added that the plan for living with Covid would take a ""cautious approach"" retaining ""some surveillance systems and plans for contingency measures"". Johnson: Do not throw Covid caution to the wind How new drugs are finally taming the virus Queen tests positive for Covid The legal requirement to self-isolate for a fixed period after testing positive in England has been in place ever since mass testing was rolled out. Currently positive or asymptomatic peoplehave to isolate for up to 10 days,but can end their isolation earlier if they register negative lateral flow tests on both days five and six. Mr Johnson has said that Covid testing would take place at a ""much lower level"" afterrevealing Â£2bn was spent on the system in January alone. Community PCR testing for people with symptoms is expected to stop under the new plan, but it is unclear whether the availability of free lateral flow tests will be reduced. On the issue of changes to testing arrangements, a Welsh government spokesperson said any decision to alter them ""would be premature and reckless"". Earlier,Stormont ministers held talks with Michael Gove, minister for intergovernmental relations, about future funding to fight the Covid pandemic ahead of the PM's announcement. It follows a joint letter from Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford and Northern Ireland's Health Minister Robin Swann warning of the need to keep existing testing in place. Covid is no longer an exceptional threat. Despite the huge wave of infections, the numbers dying in recent months has been similar to what you would expect during a normal winter. Most agree some scaling back is warranted, but it needs to be done carefully. During the pandemic Â£37 billion has been set aside for test and trace. This is a huge sum - more than has been spent on GP care. Mass PCR testing in the community is almost certain to go. But these gold standard tests will be kept in hospitals to diagnose patients who are seriously ill and to keep an eye out on variants. Many believe the Office for National Statistics surveillance survey can be done on a smaller scale, but it is essential to have something to keep a check on how the virus is spreading. Read more analysishere. Prof Sir Andrew Pollard, who helped develop the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, told the BBC's Today programme that ""there isn't a right or wrong answer"" to when restrictions change. He said: ""If restrictions change this week, next week, or the week after, in six months' time the number of transmission events will likely be very similar."" He added that having a surveillance system - ""an early warning system"" - in place whenever restrictions are eased will be ""critical"". The government is expected to urge people to exercise their own judgement. But Prof Anthony Costello, professor of global health and sustainable development at UCL, told the BBC: ""The worry about lifting the legal restrictions is that we are telling not only our population, but the world, that there is really nothing to worry about, that it's all over when it isn't."" Just over 91% of people in the UK aged 12 and over have had a first dose of a vaccine, 85% a second jab, and 66% a booster or a third dose,according to official data,external, which has been collated daily since the vaccine rollout began in December 2020. The UK's vaccine advisory body has recommended thatan additional Covid booster vaccination should be offered to all adults over the age of 75 and the most vulnerable over-12sthis spring. England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales are set to accept the advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI). The government has announced it will offera low-dose Covid vaccine to children aged between five and 11 in England during April.Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland have also said they will be offering young children the same vaccine. The prime minister's announcement will come a day after Buckingham Palace revealedthe Queen, 95, had tested positive for Covid. This video can not be played Watch: Juliet Coffer, who been isolating for over 850 days, reacts to the prospect of no Covid restrictions The new Covid plans would also see councils in England become responsible for managing outbreaks using existing powers. The Office for National Statistics infection survey, which randomly tests a sample of the population, is also expected to be replaced with a slimmed down surveillance programme. On Sunday, the UK recorded another 25,696 new infections and a further 74 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test - although Sunday figures do tend to be among the lowest of any typical week. Amid concerns that payments for people off sick due to Covid will come to an end, Wes Streeting said ""now is not the time to start charging for tests or weaken sick pay"". He said he was ""particularly concerned"" about the end of free testing and described such a move as ""like being 2-1 up with 10 minutes left of play and subbing your best defender"". Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chair of the British Medical Association, said infections need to fall further before the rules were relaxed. ""It does appear as if the government is trying to pretend that Covid doesn't exist in the day-to-day lives of so many people,"" he told the BBC. This video can not be played Watch Boris Johnson's response when asked if it's too soon to end mandatory self-isolation when testing positive Several scientists and clinicians - including Prof Anthony Costello, Dr Kit Yates and Prof  Christina Pagel - have signedan open letter,externalto Sir Chris Whitty and Sir Patrick Vallance, urging them to ""clarify the extent to which the planned policies are consistent with scientific advice and what specifically that scientific advice contained"". Plan B measures - introduced in December to stem the spread of the Omicron variant - including the requirement to wear masks in public places and the use of Covid passes for large events, were abolished in England last month. Throughout the pandemic, England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have moved at different speeds in introducing or relaxing restrictions. In Northern Ireland, all remaining Covid measures - such as certificates in nightclubs, face coverings, and limits on gatherings in homes -stopped being legally binding on Tuesday. Wales is currently at alert level zero,its lowest level of Covid rules. In Scotland, legislation covering face coverings and vaccine passports had been due to expire next Monday but earlier this month ministers extended it for another six months.

"A shortage of homes being put up for sale has led to rising asking prices and frustration for buyers, two reports suggest. The average asking price for a property in Britain has risen by Â£7,785 in February compared with last month, property portal Rightmove said. This was the largest month-on-month rise for 20 years, it said. High-end estate agent Savills found buyers could also be affected by the rising cost of living. Spring is traditionally the busiest season for the housing market. Rightmove said high demand among buyers was being driven by those looking for more space and who were ready to move on from their first homes. City property, particularly in London, was more highly sought after than during the pandemic, with some workers being encouraged to return to theÂ office. The increase in demand has pushed the average asking price across Britain to a record Â£348,804, according to Rightmove. Rental costs jump as workers return to the office First-time buyers rise: 'I couldn't keep paying rent' This demand for properties was being frustrated, according to Savills, by a lack of homes on the market. Nearly two-thirds (65%) of potential buyers said the lack of available homes was having a severe effect on their ability to buy, according to a survey of people registering with the estate agent earlier this month. Stock shortages appeared to be particularly acutely felt at the top end of the market, with 94% of buyers with a budget of Â£1m or more reporting a lack of choice. Nearly half (48%) of potential buyers had been considering a move for more than a year, with half (50%) hoping to complete within the next six months. Frances Clacy, research analyst at Savills, said: ""The imbalance of supply and demand, coupled with existing high levels of property wealth, will continue to fuel price growth in the coming months, despite the recent (Bank of England) rate rises."" But she added that ""realistic pricing"" would become more important as the market felt the knock-on effects of the rising cost of living.

"This video can not be played Louis Sainsbury has been stuck in institutional units for years Significantly fewer people with learning disabilities will be stuck far from home or in hospitals by March 2024, Scottish ministers have pledged. It follows a report,externallooking at why people with complex needs were in out-of-area placements and had inappropriate long stays in hospital. It recommended a new national register of those with learning disabilities stuck in hospitals. And a national oversight panel to hold local authorities to account. Mental Wellbeing Minister Kevin Stewart said it was ""completely unacceptable"" that people were spending time in hospitals or other care settings when they were medically fit for discharge. ""This is not going to be an easy task but we have a collective responsibility to take action,"" he said. Mothers say autistic sons locked in psychiatric units Learning disabilities 'transformation' call Learning disabilities care 'far from home' Dozens of people with learning disabilities and complex needs are recorded as delayed discharges from hospital in Scotland. They can often be stuck for many years in a hospital or care institution when they ought to be discharged to live in the community. The numbers for those with autism or learning disabilities who are held out of their local area are not routinely recorded. The Scottish government's own adviser told the BBC many of them had been ""forgotten"" or ""lost"" in the system. One example highlighted in the working group report was Louis Sainsbury. Louis and Kate Sainsbury are trying to move to a new arrangement in Perthshire Louis developed meningitis when he was four days old. As a result his speech is impaired and he has learning disabilities. His mother Kate Sainsbury said he had been stuck in an institutional unit for years. At one point he was hundreds of miles from home in Hartlepool. ""I don't want to dwell on the bad times but some of those bad times were horrible,"" she said. ""It has been a four-year nightmare trying to get my son quality care in his own home. And we are not at the end of the road. This is just the beginning."" Louis is now in the process of getting out of the locked hospital unit where he's been for more than three years - spending half his week in Perthshire, getting used to his new house and new care team. ""Transition is really crucial,"" Kate told the BBC. ""You have got to be able to build relationships with the people who are going to go forward in looking after somebody who is currently in hospital and you have got to fund that so there has got to be funding for the hospital placement and the care team."" She said collaboration was crucial too and where there was a parent involved their expertise had to be recognised. Louis' story is highlighted in the report, which recommends a national register for people with learning disabilities stuck behind locked doors and a national panel to monitor their release. Earlier this month,BBC Scotland highlighted the plight of three motherswhose sons have been stuck in hospital units for years. Kate Sainsbury said that what they had created in Perthshire for Louis was one example of how things could be done differently, but it needed committed staff and resources to succeed. Louis' new home was part-funded through a medical negligence award. His care is funded by the local authority and his disability allowance. Dr Anne Macdonald said people had been ""lost"" in the system Mental Wellbeing Minister Kevin Stewart said: ""For every day spent unnecessarily in hospital, a person loses part of their connection with their community, their family, and their friends. ""We are not protecting the rights of people with learning disabilities and complex needs if they remain in hospital when they should be living at home, or in a homely environment with the right support. ""The recommendations are key to achieving our mission to significantly reduce delayed discharge and inappropriate out-of-area placements for adults with learning disabilities and complex care needs by March 2024. ""Visibility and accountability are critical."" Scottish government professional adviser on learning disabilities, Dr Anne Macdonald, said she was delighted ministers had agreed to action the recommendations in the report. In the past she said people had been ""lost"" in the system, ""forgotten about"" for years, often hundreds of miles from home. She said for people with complex needs living a full life in the community near family was a ""human right"". ""In that sense I believe it is non-negotiable,"" she said. ""This is something we have to address. The right services and the right support don't have to be expensive."" Jan Savage, Enable Scotland director, said: ""This is a landmark moment for the human rights of people who have a learning disability in Scotland. But the day for real celebration will be the day we know that no-one is still stuck in hospital or living in communities where they don't want to be. ""Our member-led My Own Front Door campaign called for urgent action. Today - nine years after this was identified as a priority by the Scottish government - we now finally have a deadline for change by March 2024 to end this human rights scandal.""

"People should not be forced into making a ""terrible choice"" over going into work with Covid or risking losing income by self-isolating at home, the Trades Union Congress (TUC) has said. The trade union raised concerns ahead of the just-announced scrapping of the law in England to self-isolate. It said two million workers in low-paid jobs do not qualify for sick pay. Boris Johnson set out plans for the end of all Covid rules in England in the House of Commons this afternoon. From Thursday, the legal requirement to self-isolate after a positive Covid test will be removed in England, the prime minister announced. Self-isolation payments will also end from this date. At the moment, positive or asymptomatic people have to isolate for up to 10 days, but can end their isolation earlier if they register negative lateral flow tests on both days five and six. Leader of the Opposition Sir Keir Starmer said cutting support payments will hit the lowest-paid the hardest. As well as scrapping isolation requirements, Boris Johnson announced the end of free Covid tests for the general public, after the prime minister said Â£2bn was spent on tests in January. Business Minister Paul Scully told the BBC's Today programme earlier on Monday that the money ""could be spent on other priorities"" as cases and deaths continue to fall. ""We want to get people back into their workplaces, we want to get the economy working, but it will be up to employers and employees,"" he added. Living with Covid plan to restore our freedom - PM Are we ready for last Covid rule to be ditched? Kate Bell of the TUC said people who did not qualify for sick pay due to their wages were facing a ""major issue"" over choosing whether to self-isolate with Covid or not. ""If they have got Covid they want to be able to stay at home without facing a terrible choice about whether that means losing income for a week and they want to keep their colleagues safe and the other people they work with safe too,"" she said. ""That shouldn't be a choice that people are forced to make on their own."" Meanwhile, TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady told the BBC's World at One that workers could not be expected to ""fork out themselves for tests"". ""Just hoping that employers will do the right thing I think is frankly for the birds"", she added. ""Millions of workers need the government to take responsibility and not just gamble on their health, or frankly, our public health."" The prime minister has said the end to restrictions will return people's freedoms, but some experts have urged caution. Rachel Knappier, director of service at HR company Croner, told the Today programme that it looked like the decision over isolation would be ""put back in the hands"" of employers. She urged workers who were concerned to speak to their employers and said it was ""really important"" businesses have clear policies. The legal requirement to self-isolate for a fixed period after testing positive in England has been in place ever since mass testing was rolled out. Before that, most Covid testing was limited to people as they arrived in hospital with symptoms. Charlene Lyons, chief executive of the Black Sheep Brewery, told the BBC the company would pay for Covid tests for staff ""if we need to"". But she said she did not think the brewer would be ""happy paying them sick pay"" if someone had a dry cough. ""Luckily the majority of people, they can work from home if they need to,"" she added. ""For us, we're trying to adopt a principle whereby this is something we need to live with, it's like flu. ""If you feel unwell you stay off work, if you feel well you come in."" Ms Lyons said there had been ""various conversations"" with people who felt vulnerable, and added people could be isolated in the company's offices from others. Meanwhile, Chelsea Garside, who runs Ziba Hair and Beauty Salon in Monton in Greater Manchester, said she hoped people would ""use their common sense"" on isolating. ""If you're poorly, you wouldn't come to an appointment. If you had the flu, you wouldn't go to work and risk spreading it,"" she said. Ms Garside said she thought she would provide tests for her team to make it easier for them to come into work and ""create a happy space in the salon"".

"At a news conference, Boris Johnson says he is not declaring victory over Covid, after announcing end to all restrictions in England He defends scrapping free tests from 1 April, saying vulnerable people will continue to have access to them The budget for the testing programme was bigger than that of the Home Office last year, he adds From Thursday, people with a positive test will no longer need to self-isolate but will still be advised to stay at home Other nations have different rules: N Ireland has scrapped all restrictions, Wales is at alert level zero, and Scotland has eased rules but some remain England's Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty says the number of people in hospital with Covid - more than 11,000 in the UK - remains significant but is falling Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says that it looks like, for Johnson, living with Covid ""means ignoring it"" People most vulnerable to Covid will be offered an additional booster vaccine from the spring Edited by Owen Amos That brings to an end our rolling coverage of today's Covid news. You can read our main story on the end of legal restrictions in England on Thursday - and the end of free mass testing in April -here. Todayâs live page was written by Becky Morton, Joshua Nevett, Doug Faulkner, Justin Parkinson and Lauren Turner. It was edited by Claire Heald, Owen Amos and Kevin Ponniah. Many thanks for reading. Boris Johnson, Sir Patrick Vallance, and Sir Chris Whitty spent almost an hour giving statements and answering questions. Here are the main points: Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent Compared to previous variants, Omicron hasn't proved deadly for as many people. And testing is hugely expensive. Governments all over the world will have to take this decision at some point. But make no mistake - this is going down very well with Boris Johnson's backbenchers, at just the point that they hold his fate in their hands like never before. The leading voice in the Covid Recovery Group of Conservative MPs Mark Harper joked that it sounded like the PM was joining their number - a collection of backbenchers sceptical about some of the restrictions. It far from guarantees Boris Johnson's survival when the partygate rows flare up again. But it won't do him any harm. The scientists are asked whether there is a danger of giving the public mixed messages by ending self-isolation and universal free Covid testing. Prof Whitty says public health messaging is much more difficult when there is a ""transition"" but we have to accept we need to ""change the way we think about things"". He stresses that mandation is an issue for politicians and separate to public health advice. And with that final question the news conference ends - and Johnson says he is off to speak to the president of Ukraine about the ongoing crisis. The prime minister is asked whether scrapping universal free tests will add to the cost of living crisis. In response, Johnson says the change to the testing regime won't come through for a few weeks, by which point the government hopes and expects incidence of Covid will have further declined, so the impact on people will be minimal. He adds that having a strong economy is the ""single best protection"" against the cost of living crisis - and this would not have been possible if the government hadn't opened up the economy last summer. Asked whether it is hypocritical for him to ask people to take personal responsibility when he is under police investigation for breaking lockdown rules, Johnson says he cannot comment on these allegations. When asked if it's worth continuing to take regular Covid tests, Prof Whitty outlines three situations in which it might be sensible. The first, he says, is ""how common is Covid at the moment"". ""If itâs very high, absolutely, that increases probability,"" Whitty says. The second factor is the ""environment you're in"". ""If youâre in a crowded environment, absolutely,"" he says. And a test would be necessary before ""mixing with vulnerable people"", Whitty says. ""This is about minimising the risk to other people,"" he says.  This video can not be played Boris Johnson hails 'moment of pride for our nation'  This video can not be played Covid: Chris Whitty urges people to continue to self-isolate if positive Boris Johnson is asked what his message is to those who are reluctant to return to their workplace. He says he has always been a believer in the importance of people getting into work, particularly for younger people. ""I would encourage people to get back to work with confidence,"" he says. The scientists are asked whether they are more anxious than confident about restrictions being dropped. Sir Chris Whitty says he is neither anxious nor confident but instead hopes ""we can go steadily in the right direction"". Sir Patrick Vallance adds: ""The one thing this virus has taught you is not to be cocky"" - saying the country needs to go carefully and be ready to react. The prime minister says people shouldn't think there's a ""division between gung-ho politicians and cautious, anxious scientists"". He adds that Covid has not gone away and there will likely be another variant ""that will cause us trouble"" - although he says vaccines and therapeutics put us in a better position to tackle this. Next, ITV Newsâs political editor Robert Peston asks a question about the end of Covid isolation. Peston asks Johnson if he would voluntarily quarantine if he tested positive for the virus after the requirement to self-isolate is lifted after 1 April. The PM says he will âexercise restraint and responsibilityâ to avoid infecting other people. Now onto questions from journalists. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg asks about ending mass testing - and whether the other UK nations will have to follow England's lead. Boris Johnson says ending testing in April can only be done because of the high levels of immunity and relative weakness of Omicron - but says that the government will make sure vulnerable people continue to have access to free tests. He says that we will continue to invest in surveillance, pointing to the ONS survey which will keep going. ""We want to have the keenest eyes in the crow's nest to watch for an iceberg in the form of a new variant,"" he says. Prof Chris Whitty says there are three reasons for testing - surveillance, to guide clinical treatment and for control - the last of which is what is being scaled back. Johnson is also asked about Russian President Vladimir Putin recognising breakaway republics in Ukraine and describes it as a ""dark omen"". You can read our live coverage on the ongoing crisishere. Gemma, from Greater London, asks what the advice is for pregnant women like herself and other people who are more vulnerable to Covid. Have they effectively been told to stay inside? she asks. No, is Boris Johnson's response - but he says everybody who is vulnerable should be treated with the ""utmost consideration"". ""If weâre symptomatic with any disease you should treat vulnerable people with courtesy and avoid spreading it,"" he says. Clinically vulnerable people will also continue to have access to tests and any therapeutics they need, the prime minister says. Sir Chris Whitty adds that it is now really clear that vaccination in pregnancy is a very
good thing for both the mother and her baby - and he urges pregnant women to get vaccinated. Now to the Q&A session, beginning with members of the public. First to ask a question is Nicole from the West Midlands. She says it appears that hospitalisations are at a similar level to that seen in October last year. âShould we put in place more measures to protect NHS?â she asks. Johnson is first to reply. The big difference between then and now is the number of hospitalisations is on a ""clear downward trend,"" he says. ""Youâll have seen the fatality numbers, which are different to what weâve seen in previous waves."" He says high level of vaccine immunity has allowed the restrictions to be lifted. Urging the public to continue to be cautious, Sir Patrick finishes by quoting an American colleague, who says: ""You can celebrate when the sun's shining - but take your umbrella with you."" Sir Patrick says it is absolutely essential to have a good surveillance system to detect new variants. The second thing that is important is to be able to respond quickly, he says, pointing at how quickly Omicron took off. He says it is important to be able to ramp up systems to respond quickly to new threats. There is also a section of the population which is vulnerable at all itimes, he adds, and says it is important to protect them. ""Detect, respond and protect the most vulnerable is absolutely crucial during a period of reducing the measures that are in place,"" he says. Sir Patrick Vallance begins to speak - he says the virus will continue to evolve quite quickly, probably for the next couple of years. And there is no guarantee that the next variant will be of the same reduced severity as Omicron, he says. We expect there to be further variants and they could be more severe, he adds. Prof Whitty says that excess mortality is actually lower than you might expect on average at this time of year, compared with the years before the pandemic. He says the impact on overall mortality has been ""much more muted"" and is ""essentially not visible"" compared to the previous waves of coronavirus. But he says the Omicron wave is still high, with some places in the UK having one in 20 to one in 25 people having the infection, according to ONS data. On the changes to the rules, Whitty says this is a steady move over a period of time as the rates are going down. ""This is not a sudden everything stops,"" he says. Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent There are two big reasons why the government has decided to act now in getting rid of the remaining coronavirus laws in England. The first is the current picture: Omicron has proved to be very mild in terms of the number of people it is killing. To use the technical term, there haven't been any excess deaths as a result of it, or, as Prof Chris Whitty has just put it, ""the total number of deaths is slightly lower than the seasonal average at this time of year"". The second is cost: the prime minister has said the test, trace and isolation budget in the 2020/21 financial year exceeded the entire budget of the Home Office. It has cost a further Â£15.7bn in this financial year - from last April until now - and a another Â£2bn in January of this year alone. England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, is now taking us through the latest data. He says the number of people in hospital with Covid in the UK is ""still significant"" and this is still putting quite a lot of pressure on many hospitals. However, he says the rates ""have been going down steadily now for some
weeks"". Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,0.00017410934
"Russian forces launch a full-scale assault on Ukraine, with its military attacking the country from the north, east and south Ukrainian President Zelensky says 137 Ukrainian citizens - both soldiers and civilians - died on Thursday People in the capital, Kyiv, and elsewhere are trying to flee - some 100,000 have left so far, the UN says There are also renewed reports of explosions in the port city of Mariupol, home to half a million people Russians seize control of the Chernobyl complex - site of the world's worst nuclear disaster UK and US announce fresh new sanctions on Russia, including asset freezes on banks President Vladimir Putin defends his move, saying there was no other way to defend Russia But US President Joe Biden says Putin's aggression will cost Russia dearly Edited by Jude Sheerin For technical reasons too boring to explain, we are switching our live coverageto a new webpage here. For all the latest developments on the conflict, please follow us to the new link. President Joe Biden and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz have both said that cutting Russia off from the global banking system, Swift, is not being proposed right now. But what would happen if it was? Excluding Russia from Swift would risk severe repercussions for banks that are owed
money  - either now or in the longer term. This is particularly true in Germany, which has deep financial ties with Russia and feels it has done its share of economic sacrifice by suspending certification of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Although being de-Swifted would be disruptive for Russia, there is an alternate system - called CFPS - that Russia set up after it annexed Crimea in 2014. Similarly, China has also set up a secondary system, CIPS. Expelling Russia would probably only push it closer to China and play into the hands of the Xi administration, which is keen to ""de-dollarise"" the world's financial architecture. This would accelerate that trend and ambition. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky reportedly just said ""the enemy has designated me as the target number one, and my family as the target number two"". In a video address carried by Ukrainian media, Zelensky says he is staying in the capital Kyiv's ""government quarters"" and his family is also in Ukraine. He did not provide further details. Zelensky also warns that Ukrainian officials now have ""information that enemy sabotage groups have entered Kyiv"". The president did not elaborate on what those groups might be. More on the situation at Chernobyl tonight: White House press secretary Jen Psaki just told reporters at her daily briefing that there are reports Russian soldiers are holding the staff of the Ukrainian nuclear site hostage. ""We are outraged by credible reports that Russian soldiers are currently holding the staff of the Chernobyl facilities hostage,"" she said. ""This unlawful and dangerous hostage-taking, which could upend the routine civil service efforts required to maintain and protect the nuclear waste facilities, is obviously incredibly alarming and gravely concerning. ""We condemn it and we request their release."" Read more on this here. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson told his government on Thursday evening that Ukrainian soldiers have been putting up a fight, tweets the BBC's political correspondent Iain Watson.

Russian forces have taken control of Chernobyl, site of the 1986 nuclear disaster and a place that remains radioactive to this day - prompting significant concern from international nuclear watchdogs. Prof Claire Corkhill, nuclear materials expert at Sheffield University, told the BBC about the dangers of military clashes taking place near the site. âThis is not a place to have ammunition flying around,"" she said. The Chernobyl site contains several nuclear waste containment facilities - including the ânew safe confinementâ - the protective dome that covers the reactor that was so badly damaged by the infamous 1986 explosion. âThese buildings are designed to keep radioactive materials inside, but theyâre not necessarily armoured; theyâre not designed to operate in a war zone,â she said. Prof Corkhill said that although piercing one of these structures  wouldnât necessarily cause a repeat of the Chernobyl disaster - where plumes of radioactive material dispersed across Europe - it could âset us back 30 years in terms of the work that has been done clearing up the siteâ. It could release and disperse radioactive material in the local area, she said. Chris MorrisBBC Reality Check The Nord Stream 2 pipeline that would bring gas to Germany has shuttered amid the latest fighting There was plenty of criticism that Western sanctions in the days leading up to this invasion did not go far enough, fast enough. These new measures will hit the Russian economy much harder. But there are still potential gaps. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said sanctions against major Russian banks include one of the largest state banks, VTB, which will have all its assets frozen. But another major bank, Sberbank, was not mentioned. And the Ukrainian government wanted more â in particular moves to disconnect Russia from the international payment system known as Swift, which thousands of banks use to exchange information. The US and the UK are in favour of such a move, but some European countries fear it could damage their own banks. Suspending Russia from Swift is still under consideration, but the hesitation is a reminder that in a globalised world all sanctions tend to have an impact on the countries imposing them as well. And the real trouble with sanctions is that they donât work quickly. They do increase pressure, and they can do damage. But the international community is not trying to damage the Russian economy just for the sake of doing so. It wants economic pressure to force a change in Putinâs political and military calculations. Meanwhile, the invasion of Ukraine continues. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has just signed a decree ordering a general mobilisation. All Ukrainians who can carry arms have been urged to defend their homeland. The country's conscripts and reservists are also being called up, according to the decree, which is to be in effect for 90 days. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says 137 Ukrainian citizens - both soldiers and civilians - died on Thursday, the first day of a massive Russian military assault. Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News The head of Britain's MI6 has tweeted about intelligence on Ukraine. âUS and UK
intelligence communities uncovered Putinâs plans for Ukraine. We exposed his
attempts to engineer âfalse flagâ, fake attacks to justify his invasion. We
revealed his plans to assassinate Ukrainian leaders and senior officials,â
Richard Moore, also known as ""C"", said in a tweet. âThis attack was long
planned, unprovoked, cruel aggression. No amount of Russian disinformation will
now disguise that fact from the international community,"" wrote the Secret Intelligence Service chief. US and UK intelligence seem to have had an unusual and highly
accurate level of insight into Putinâs plans and strategy. The unprecedented
publicising of some of that intelligence has had tactical success in partly disrupting Putinâs plans - including for provocations and false flags. It may have also helped draw Western countries closer together. But even this
level of insight couldnât provide a way of stopping or deterring him. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Long queues have been seen at bus and train station in the capital Kyiv, as people have been desperately trying to go western regions of Ukraine All Ukrainian men aged between 18 to 60 are now banned from leaving the country, Ukraine's state border guard service (DPSA) says. It adds the measure is aimed at ""guaranteeing Ukraine's defence and the organisation of timely mobilisation"". The temporary ban will remain in force for the duration of martial law declared on Thursday morning. Steve RosenbergBBC Moscow Correspondent I think Vladimir Putin is fuelled by resentment at how the Cold War ended, with the West declaring victory and Russia losing power, influence and territory. I think he's also motivated by an almost semi-religious belief that Ukraine must be with Russia, must be in Russia's orbit, and Russia as a great power has the right to its own sphere of influence. I also think he has disdain for the West and Western leaders, whom he deems weak and disunited. What can the West do about this? Itâs very difficult to say. I think the Kremlin would've factored in sanctions. The Kremlin will know that the US will not put boots on the ground in Ukraine. The West does not want a war with Russia and Russia knows that. But I would say this. If youâve been in power for 22 years, as Putin has, you start to feel invincible, you start to think you canât put a foot wrong, that youâre Teflon. And that's when mistakes start to creep in. Just from speaking to people on the streets and witnessing the strength of feeling against this offensive, I wonder whether this Russian invasion will turn out to be Putin's fatal error. Countless city residents are hunkered in subways to avoid potential fighting Countless Kyiv residents are sleeping in underground metro stations as midnight approaches in Ukraine. The people - some of whom have brought their pets, extension cords and even air mattresses - are mostly calm, according to one evacuee. The place is ""not too crowded, most people are scrolling their phones, trying to catch the latest news"", says Oksana Potapova. ""We seem settled enough to spend the night here,"" she wrote on Facebook. ""And given the news about heavy fighting near Kyiv, the takeover of Chernobyl power plant, and forecasts of possible attacks on Kyiv, it seems like a good decision."" Paul AdamsBBC diplomatic correspondent A new iron curtain is falling
across Europe. Thatâs what this countryâs
beleaguered president, Volodymyr Zelensky, said in his most recent televised
statement. The echoes of Winston
Churchillâs famous 1946 speech in Fulton, Missouri were powerful. âFrom Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the
Adriatic, an iron curtain has descended across the continent,â Churchill told
his audience back then. Todayâs iron curtain has moved eastwards,
meandering from the Gulf of Finland, around Belarus and along Ukraineâs eastern
border and on down to the Black Sea. That, Zelensky says, is where it should stay, with
Ukraine firmly on the west. But that conviction feels like a fragile,
disappearing dream tonight, as Russian armour cuts deep into Ukrainian
territory, with the prospect of worse to come. With savage ferocity, Vladimir Putin has reached
out, grabbed Ukraine by the scruff of the neck and is trying, by force of arms,
to drag this hopeful nation back across the fence. Night has fallen and a curfew is in effect in Kyiv after the first full day of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. If you're just joining us, or catching up on events, here's what's been going on:  If you want more detail, you can read our guide to the conflict, and how it has unfolded today, byclicking here. Ilya BarabanovBBC Russian Service, Kyiv Smoke rises in the background as people walk down a street near the airfield All day long the Russian troops have been trying to take over an airfield at Hostomel, on the northern outskirts of the Ukrainian capital. This airfield is of strategic importance: if captured it could become a springboard for the Russian army into Kyiv. Judging from verified videos, at least two Russian helicopters were shot down over it. Journalists from CNN filmed a group of Russian paratroopers landing there while the Bellingcat investigative website said it had intelligence that 18 war planes with reinforcements were heading towards it from Russia. Later in the evening it became clear that a heavy battle for Hostomel was raging and Ukrainian forces were using both airstrikes and artillery. By 11pm Kyiv time (21:00 GMT) an official statement was released, saying that the airfield was back in the Ukrainian hands. A protester is detained in Saint Petersburg More than 1,700 people have been arrested during anti-war protests across dozens of cities in Russia, an independent monitor reports. More than 900 were arrested in Moscow and over 400 in Saint Petersburg, according to OVD-Info, which tracks arrests at opposition rallies. Thousands gathered near Pushkin Square in central Moscow, while up to 1,000 people gathered in the former imperial capital Saint Petersburg, the AFP news agency reports. Many held Ukrainian flags in Moscow ""No to war"" was spray-painted on the front gate of the Russian parliament's lower house. ""I am in shock. My relatives and loved ones live in Ukraine,"" Anastasia Nestulya, 23, told AFP in Moscow. ""What can I tell them over the phone? You hang in there?"" Navalny (standing) while on trial from prison Jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny - on trial in a Moscow prison -  has accused Vladimir Putin of using the invasion of Ukraine to cover up Russian corruption. In a video published by independent news outlet Dozhd, Navalny is heard expressing his opposition to the invasion of Ukraine. Wearing a prison uniform, he says it would lead to a ""huge number of victims, destroyed futures and the continuation of this line of impoverishment of the citizens of Russia"". This war between Russia and Ukraine was unleashed to cover up the theft from Russian citizens and divert their attention from problems that exist inside the country. Alexei Navalny Navalny has been jailed for over a year on old fraud charges, after surviving a poison attack, which he and the West say was carried out by the Kremlin. He is being tried inside the maximum security prison on new charges that could see his imprisonment extended by a decade. Vladimir Putin has spoken by phone to French President Emmanuel Macron and given him an ""exhaustive"" explanation of the reasons for
Russia's actions in Ukraine, the Kremlin says. Macron requested the call and they agreed to stay in contact, the Kremlin says. In France, the Elysee Palace says Macron spoke first to Ukraine's President Zelensky. He then spoke to President Putin and demanded an end to military operations and warned of massive sanctions. The French president has attempted to avert a Russian invasion in recent weeks, including holding talks
with Putin in the Kremlin. Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva The UN Refugee Agency warned today of a rapidly deteriorating situation in Ukraine as people flee their homes looking for safety. UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, warned ""the humanitarian consequences on civilian populations will be devastating. There are no winners in war but countless lives will be torn apart"". The refugee agency is calling on Ukraineâs neighbours to keep their borders open to those fleeing and says it stands ready to ""support efforts by all to respond to any situation of forced displacement"". Meanwhile, the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Peter Maurer, called on those fighting to respect international law, and to ensure civilians were protected. The UN had already issued a record appeal for funding in 2022 to relieve crises in Syria, Yemen, Afghanistan, and the drought-ridden Sahel region in Africa. A further major conflict and refugee crisis in the middle of Europe could stretch its resources well beyond their limits. Â© 2025 BBC.

He first got into film-making after his parents gave him a video camera as a Christmas present when he was 15. Born in Luton and later moving to west London, he was appointed an MBE for services to music in 2014. A pioneering figure in British rap and grime music, Edwards attended the Brit Awards earlier this month, and was understood to have performed as a DJ at a gig in north London on Saturday night. His company confirmed his death to the BBC on Sunday, saying he died that morning. His mother said he ""passed away after a sudden illness"". Allow Twitter content?

In 2019, he directed theChelsea FC remix video,externalof grime artist Capo Lee's Style and Swag, and the video featured several of the team's players. It's impossible to overstate how important Jamal Edwards was to British rap. His YouTube channel, which was started ""on a Â£20 phone"" while he was still at school, has given early exposure to almost every key player in the game. Stormzy, Skepta, JME, J Hus, Lady Leshurr, Dave, AJ Tracey, Krept & Konan, Headie Oneâ¦ the list is endless. To an extent, SBTV was formed out of frustration. ""Everyone in my area was an MC and I remember thinking, 'Why can't I find these online? I'm going to film people in my area and upload it to Youtube',""Edwards told BBC Radio 1Xtra in 2017,external. ""And from there it just started building and growing."" SBTV arrived at a crucial time, showing that grime could thrive online, while police were attempting to shut down gigs with the controversial risk-assessment form 696. The channel's success meant Edwards became known as an entrepreneur and businessman - but he was a reluctant frontman. ""I wanted to be the Banksy,"" he said. ""I wanted no-one to know who I was."" That changed in 2011, when he featured in an advert for Google Chrome. His name was searched more than a million times. and people started approaching him for selfies. But he put his fame to good use - raising awareness of mental health, funding youth centres and encouraging other young entrepreneurs. Music remained his true passion, though, and he never stopped supporting the artists he loved. As recently as December, he encouraged Ed Sheeran to record a new verse for a song he'd discovered by Nigerian artist Fireboy DML. That track,Peru,external, climbed to number two in the UK charts, giving the African star his first international hit. Edwards took no credit - he never did - but hundreds of artists have similar stories. His loss will be felt throughout the UK music scene. BBC 1Xtra DJ and presenter Nadia Jae told Newsbeat that Edwards ""helped me with my career"", adding: ""He's helped so many people, put them in places that they never would have been and did a lot of the pushing of doors to make sure that our industry is as fruitful as it is now."" She added: ""He had a heart of gold, I don't know anyone who has a bad word to say about Jamal. ""He broke so many barriers, I don't know if we're ever going to get another Jamal.""

""You can say my videos had mixed reviews to begin with, some people didn't get them, but others thought they were sick [good],"" he said.
