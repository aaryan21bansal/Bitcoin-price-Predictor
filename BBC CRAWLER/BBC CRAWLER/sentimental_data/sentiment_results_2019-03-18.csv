"Ruth Maguire travelled to Carlingford on Saturday A body has been found in the search for a County Down woman missing after a hen party in the Republic of Ireland. Ruth Maguire, 30, a mother of three, travelled to Carlingford, County Louth, on Saturday, to celebrate with friends. The Newcastle woman was reported missing on Sunday morning after she failed to return from their night out. A search operation involving the RNLI, coastguard and divers from a local club has now ended following the discovery of a body in Carlingford Lough. Police said they believed the body was that of the missing woman. Ms Maguire, who was originally from Belfast, was part of a 32-strong group who had travelled to Carlingford to celebrate a forthcoming wedding. The group was staying at a house in the town and realised Ms Maguire had not returned after midnight. One of her friends told BBC News NI that her disappearance was ""completely out of character"". Friends had appealed for anyone with CCTV footage around the harbour area to check it. Kilkeel RNLI recovered the body following a major search effort involving several RNLI and coastguard teams, Dundalk sub-aqua club divers, the Rescue 116 helicopter, Irish Coast Guard's all-weather boat and foot unit. A body was recovered around lunchtime on Monday John Fisher, from Kilkeel RNLI, said: ""This was not the outcome we or the family wanted and at this difficult time our thoughts and prayers are with the family and friends of the casualty. ""I would also like to thank the volunteer crew for their commitment and energy. We train for such an incident but always pray that it has a better outcome.""

"Cadbury said it did not mean to encourage people to ""break existing regulations"" Cadbury has withdrawn an advertising campaign urging children to dig for treasure after archaeologists said it encouraged people to break the law. The campaign on its website called on children to ""grab a metal detector"" and dig holes looking for gold or treasure. Dr Aisling Tierney, of Bristol University, said it was ""intensely stupid"" andpeople could be prosecuted for digging without permission. Cadbury confirmed it had removed the campaign web page. Dr Tierney welcomed the U-turn, but said Cadbury ""is sorely lacking in understanding the gravity of the problem"". ""They have grasped that their content promoted 'breaking the rules' but actually, it was the rule of law."" The campaign invited people to ""get your hands dirty"" and ""have a quick check"" She said she hoped the company ""learns from this experience and take the opportunity to develop something better that will respect heritage"". Historic England said: ""There are strict rules that protect England's archaeological heritage, including laws governing use of metal detectors. ""We are glad to see the campaign website is no longer live, and would be happy to advise Cadbury to make sure any future campaign doesn't have unwelcome results."" Cadbury said the campaign was aimed at inspiring families ""to go on everyday adventures together"". It said: ""It was not our intention to encourage anyone to break existing regulations regarding the discovery of new archaeological artefacts and we are grateful this matter has been brought to our attention. ""We can now confirm that the webpage has been taken down and we are updating the content to focus solely on directing families to museums where existing treasures can be found.""

"This video can not be played The Labrador cross and its owner stayed together for warmth A snowsports enthusiast survived subzero temperatures in blizzard conditions in the Cairngorms by cuddling his dog to keep warm. The splitboarder had become disorientated and cold on Saturday. The man, who is from the Edinburgh area and raised the alarm on his mobile phone, was well equipped and got inside a survival bag with his Labrador cross. Members of Cairngorm Mountain Rescue Team found them and escorted them to safety. Al Gilmour, of Cairngorm MRT, said the man and his dog would have been unlikely to have survived the night out in a ""real blast of Scottish winter"" conditions. Dog lost in hills rescued by helicopter The man had become disorientated in the Cairngorms near Aviemore in snow and 40mph winds. He was using a splitboard - a type of snowboard that can be separated into two ski-like sections. Cairngorm MRT faced a challenge in pinpointing the man's position as the first phone call he managed to make was ""garbled"" and did not have a strong enough signal for the team to get a location. Mr Gilmour told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""We had a few teams going in from different directions to sort of attempt a pincer movement to try and search for him. ""A second phone call came in and because of that we got a position and then we could send people directly to him."" Members of Cairngorm MRT during the rescue effort There was a risk of avalanches in the area the man and his dog were found in and the team had to carefully escort them from there to the safety of the Cairngorm Mountain ski area. Mr Gilmour said the man was ""very well-equipped"" and had everything he should have had for his trip. But Mr Gilmour added: ""Unfortunately the conditions were too much for him. ""He hadn't drank or eaten enough and got very cold and this affected his decision making and ability to use a map and compass. ""He had exceptionally cold hands and opening his jacket pockets had become difficult. ""He had a survival bag and he got into that with the dog and shared heat until we came and found them. ""For both of them that companionship had a positive influence in keeping them warm.""

"Bethan Colebourn's family said she ""brought joy to people's lives"" A mother who murdered her three-year-old daughter following the break-up of her marriage has been jailed for life. Claire Colebourn, 36, drowned Bethan in a bath at their family home in Fordingbridge, Hampshire, in 2017. Colebourn tried to take her own life after killing her daughter but was revived by paramedics. She was found guilty of murder on Friday. She showed no emotion as the judge at Winchester Crown Court told her she must serve at least 18 years. Claire Colebourn was revived by paramedics after trying to kill herself Mrs Justice Johannah Cutts said Bethan was ""a beautiful little girl who was full of life. She had everything to live for"". The judge said Colebourn should have asked for help after her life became an ""emotional rollercoaster"" when her marriage broke down and her husband left the family home. Despite being in a ""highly emotional state"" there was ""no evidence of mental illness"" and there was ""no excuse"" for the killing, the judge said. ""You were her mother, you were responsible for her care and her wellbeing. ""You wanted to deny your husband the chance to bring up Bethan. Bethan was entitled to and deserved a life,"" the judge added. Michael Colebourn separated from wife Claire in September 2017 In a statement released through the police, Michael Colebourn said: ""There are no words to describe the past 18 months. The one thing in my life that gave me purpose has gone. ""My beautiful daughter has been taken from me in such a cold and callous manner at the very hands of the one other person that should have protected her and kept her safe. ""Throughout the criminal trial, I, and all those that loved Bethan have had to endure the heartbreak of listening to her last moments. ""I have also had to suffer endless unfounded allegations and lies made against me with no opportunity to respond. ""I desperately miss being a daddy - we would have such great times together; Bethan's laugh was infectious and her energy was endless. There is not a second in the day that goes by that I am not thinking about her."" A large police operation began at the home after the discovery of Bethan's body Former biology teacher Colebourn was found guilty of murder by unanimous verdict on Friday after the 11-strong jury deliberated for two hours. She did not react as the verdict was delivered. Bethan was found lying in bed at her home in Whitsbury Road by her grandmother on 19 October 2017. Paramedics were unable to revive her. Prosecutors said Colebourn had an ""unfounded"" belief that her husband Michael, a company chief executive, was having an affair. In a Facebook post Colebourn wrote: ""Michael walked out on his family on 7 September and we haven't seen him since. Bethan died in hospital after being found at the family home in Whitsbury Road ""He has been having an affair with his financial director at work. Everything has been pre-planned. ""They are aiming to conquer the business and set up a new life together."" Colebourn set an alarm for 03:00 and then took Bethan to the bathroom where she ran a bath and drowned her. She had told police: ""She woke up... she put her hands on my cheeks, told me she loved me and said 'I don't want a bath, mummy, I don't want a bath'."" She then attempted to take own life by repeatedly injecting herself with insulin. During the trial, it was heard Colebourn had searched for websites about suicide and drowning. Karim Khalil QC, defending, said Colebourn appeared to have a personality disorder but this was disputed by experts. Colebourn has spent nearly a year in custody which will be deducted from the minimum term before she faces the parole board which will determine whether she is ever released.

Mr Nyusi flew over some of the worst-hit areas on Monday. He described seeing bodies floating in the rivers. The storm made landfall near the port city of Beira on Thursday with winds of up to 177 km/h (106 mph), but aid teams only reached the city on Sunday. A UN aid worker told the BBC that every building in Beira - home to half a million people - had been damaged. Gerald Bourke, from the UN's World Food Programme, said: ""No building is untouched. There is no power. There is no telecommunications. The streets are littered with fallen electricity lines. ""The roofs on so many houses have fallen in, likewise the walls. A lot of people in the city have lost their homes."" Rescue crews spent much of the night helping people from trees, Jamie LeSeur, the head of the IFRC assessment team, told the BBC.

More than 1,500 people were injured by falling trees and debris from buildings including zinc roofing, officials in the capital Maputo told the BBC. ""Almost everything has been affected by the calamity,"" Alberto Mondlane, the governor of Sofala province, which includes Beira, said on Sunday.

Praise Chipore, 31, was recovering in hospital in Chimanimani Shingai Nyoka, BBC Africa, eastern Zimbabwe My journey to Chimanimani ended abruptly when we came across a huge crater in the road. The river was raging below and scores of people were standing on either side. This was the main road linking the city of Mutare to the villages of Chimanimani, which have been cut off. Aid teams have been unable to get through. People who live in this area say they have never seen anything like this. An elderly couple, Edson and Miriam Sunguro, told me that they have been trying to contact relatives in Chimanimani without success. ""There is a risk of more rain over the next few days for the northern half of Mozambique and southern Malawi,"" BBC Weather's Chris Fawkes said.

"Armando, pictured, is now enjoying his retirement A champion pigeon has been sold for a record â¬1.25m ($1.42m; Â£1.07m). Auction house Pipa called Armando the ""best Belgian long-distance pigeon of all time"". He's also been dubbed the ""Lewis Hamilton of pigeons"". Before this sale, the record was â¬376,000 (Â£321,800). However, Pipa says this was beaten within a day of Armando being put up for bids. The champ, who turns five this year, is now enjoying his retirement and has already fathered a number of chicks. ""It was unreal, the feeling - it was something out of this world,"" Nikolaas Gyselbrecht, the CEO of Pipa - short for ""Pigeon Paradise"" - told the BBC of the moment someone put down a bid of more than â¬1m. ""In our wildest dreams, we had never hoped for a price like that. We hoped for around â¬400,000 to â¬500,000, and we only dreamed of â¬600,000."" He's going to turn five this year Mr Gyselbrecht said that two buyers from China ended up in a bidding war, escalating from â¬532,000 up to â¬1.25m in just over an hour. To put it all in perspective, he says, the usual price for a racing pigeon is around â¬2,500. But Armando is no usual pigeon.

"Cadbury said it did not mean to encourage people to ""break existing regulations"" Cadbury has withdrawn an advertising campaign urging children to dig for treasure after archaeologists said it encouraged people to break the law. The campaign on its website called on children to ""grab a metal detector"" and dig holes looking for gold or treasure. Dr Aisling Tierney, of Bristol University, said it was ""intensely stupid"" andpeople could be prosecuted for digging without permission. Cadbury confirmed it had removed the campaign web page. Dr Tierney welcomed the U-turn, but said Cadbury ""is sorely lacking in understanding the gravity of the problem"". ""They have grasped that their content promoted 'breaking the rules' but actually, it was the rule of law."" The campaign invited people to ""get your hands dirty"" and ""have a quick check"" She said she hoped the company ""learns from this experience and take the opportunity to develop something better that will respect heritage"". Historic England said: ""There are strict rules that protect England's archaeological heritage, including laws governing use of metal detectors. ""We are glad to see the campaign website is no longer live, and would be happy to advise Cadbury to make sure any future campaign doesn't have unwelcome results."" Cadbury said the campaign was aimed at inspiring families ""to go on everyday adventures together"". It said: ""It was not our intention to encourage anyone to break existing regulations regarding the discovery of new archaeological artefacts and we are grateful this matter has been brought to our attention. ""We can now confirm that the webpage has been taken down and we are updating the content to focus solely on directing families to museums where existing treasures can be found.""

"This video can not be played Lucy Turner arriving at St Albans Crown Court A getaway driver who broke a woman's back when she rammed into her in a supermarket car park has been jailed. Lucy Turner, 32, sent shop worker Danielle Wood sprawling over the bonnet as she drove into shoppers outside Tesco in Rickmansworth on 23 December. They tried to block the car with their trolleys as Turner attempted to drive off with stolen alcohol. She was jailed for three years and two months for offences including causing serious injury by dangerous driving. Turner, from Borehamwood, also pleaded guilty to two charges of theft, attempted theft, using a vehicle without insurance, driving while disqualified, failing to stop and failing to report a collision. St Albans Crown Court heard Turner was the getaway driver as her accomplices - a man and woman - stole Â£174 worth of alcohol. After failing to get out of the fire exit, they were intercepted by staff at the front door, with the store manager trying to block the car with trolleys, prosecutor Richard Jones said. A social media video of shoppers being driven at was shared hundreds of times. Danielle Wood wears a brace to support her back after being knocked over After hitting Ms Wood at an estimated 35mph, Turner swapped places in the car with the man, who barged out of the car park and fled. He remains on the run, the court was told. Ms Wood, 26, said she was ""petrified"" as the car drove at her at between 35mph and 40mph. ""I was in agony. I knew I had broken my back. I was screaming 'My back, my back!'"" she said. She was treated in hospital over Christmas for a fractured vertebra but, three months on, is still wearing a brace and has postponed planning her wedding. Ms Wood added: ""I fear I will always have pain. It hurts emotionally and physically."" Chantelle Stocks, defending, said Turner had developed a drug addiction after the death of her son in 2008. Turner was also banned from driving for four-and-a-half years.

"This video can not be played PM Jacinda Ardern says details of gun law reforms will come within days New Zealand PM Jacinda Ardern has said she will announce detailed gun law reforms within days, after an attack on two mosques left 50 people dead. Ms Ardern said her cabinet had backed gun law changes ""in principle"". Australian Brenton Tarrant, 28, a self-described white supremacist, has been charged with murder. Police say the killer used military-style assault weapons modified to make them more deadly - which is not illegal under current legislation. What are New Zealand's gun laws? Stories of heroism emerge from NZ attacks Who are the victims? The prime minister gave no details at her press conference on Monday but said they would made clear soon. ""This ultimately means that within 10 days of this horrific act of terrorism, we will have announced reforms which will, I believe, make our community safer,"" she said. Ms Ardern was appearing alongside her coalition partner and Deputy PM Winston Peters, who has previously opposed changes to gun laws. Erdogan criticised for showing NZ video# Social sites seek to stop NZ attack clips The 'precious' mosque where peace was shattered Mr Peters said he fully supported the prime minister on the issue, adding: ""The reality is that after 1pm on Friday, our world changed forever and so will our laws."" Ms Ardern said: ""We have made a decision as a cabinet. We are unified."" She also announced that an inquiry would look into the lead-up to the attacks, and what might have been done differently. At the weekend, Ms Ardern said the suspect had a gun licence, obtained in November 2017, and owned five guns. Weaponry shown in the footage circulating of the attack Earlier on Monday, gun retailer Gun City said it had sold four weapons to the alleged gunman online, but it did not sell him the high-powered weapon used in the mosque shootings. CEO David Tipple told a news conference in Christchurch it had only sold him A-category weapons. Under New Zealand's gun laws, A-category weapons can be semi-automatic but limited to seven shots. Video footage of the attacks appeared to show the gunman's weapon had a magazine with a larger capacity, which is also available legally. There are an estimated 1.5 million privately owned firearms in the country. This video can not be played Christchurch students perform Haka for shooting victims Since the attack there have been calls for semi-automatic weapons to be banned. Previous attempts to tighten gun laws have failed due to a strong gun lobby and a culture of hunting. The minimum legal age to own a gun in New Zealand is 16, or 18 for military-style semi-automatic weapons. Anyone over those ages who is considered by police to be ""fit and proper"" can possess a firearm All gun-owners must have a licence, but most individual weapons do not have to be registered. New Zealand is one of the few countries where this is the case Applicants for a firearms licence must pass a background check of criminal and medical records Once a licence has been issued, gun owners can buy as many weapons as they want Footage of the killings was live-streamed by the attacker. On Sunday police said it was now classified as an objectionable publication and therefore it was an offence to distribute or possess the material. How the attacks unfolded More about the suspect An 18-year-old appeared in court on Monday, charged with distributing the live-stream. The teenager was also charged with publishing a photograph of the mosque with the message ""target acquired"" and faces a maximum of 14 years in prison for each charge, according to the prosecution. Facebook said it had removed 1.5 million videos of the attack around the world in the first 24 hours. By Jay Savage, BBC News, Christchurch Many returned to work and school on Monday, but little about it felt ordinary. If anything, the signs of the city's emotions became more visible. Flowers left at the main tribute site swelled, easily doubling what was there a day earlier. Outside Al Noor mosque, hundreds of people attended an afternoon vigil. It featured a thundering haka, performed by dozens of schoolchildren. Other students stood together singing softly or linking arms in silence. A few cried openly. The importance of coming together was the main topic of conversation. This video can not be played New Zealand church-goers rally to help mosque attack victims Nine people remain in hospital in a critical condition. This video can not be played Farid Ahmed: ""I have forgiven him and I will pray for him"" Frustration is building among relatives over the release of the bodies of the dead for burial. The first release was approved on Sunday but the family say another relative was killed and they want them released together. No burials will take place on Monday. Islamic tradition calls for the cleansing and burial of bodies as soon as possible after death. Brenton Tarrant on Monday fired his state-appointed lawyer, Richard Peters. Mr Peters says the defendant has indicated he ""wants to be self-represented in this case"". Brenton Tarrant appeared in court on Saturday charged with murder. Images of the defendant must be shown obscured under New Zealand law The lawyer added: ""The way he presented was rational and someone who was not suffering any mental disability. He seemed to understand what was going on."" Australian police raided two homes near Sydney on Mondayas part of the inquiry. Australian media reported that one of the homes belongs to Brenton Tarrant's sister. The family is co-operating with the authorities. An uncle of Brenton Tarrant said: ""We are so sorry for the families over there, for the dead and injured."" New Zealand police confirmed on Monday they believed there was only one attacker, but added that this did not rule out others might have provided support.

"This video can not be played Speaker John Bercow rejects further Brexit votes without changes to motion ""He's breaking the constitution"" - quite the accusation, laid at the door of John Bercow's grand speaker's apartments. It's notable because it's the view of a government minister who is not one of those whose pulse quickens when discussing leaving or trying to stay in the European Union. There is, of course, precedent in the very well-thumbed copies of Erskine May, the parliamentary rules, for the speaker's decision. Quoting decisions as far back as 1604,John Bercow was quite clearthat governments are not meant to be able to keep asking parliament the same question, in the hope of boring MPs into submission if they keep saying no. But as another member of the government put it mildly, the speaker has a reputation for being ""interventionist"", and he has, this afternoon, chucked a hulking great spanner in the works. After the speaker's intervention, Theresa May's way forward is far from clear The government seems to have been cooling all day on the idea of getting MPs to vote again on Theresa May's Brexit deal this week, for a whole shopping list of reasons. But before Number 10 had a chance to make that decision, the speaker took it out of their hands. There will be no ""MV3"", to use the terrible jargon - there won't be another vote on the prime minister's Brexit deal unless it changes. Strangely, MPs who hate Theresa May's compromise, for different reasons, agree to an extent that it's the right call. But there is anger and astonishment too, partly because MPs will have to explain another potential delay to the process, when many of them sense the public's desire is to crack on. Listen: Brexitcast - Erskine Mayhem But there is festering concern about John Bercow's suspected wish to stop Brexit - always denied. This time the speaker, whose job it is stand up for parliament, has - with no warning - made a decision that some in government believe veers too close to trying to block the government from what it seeks to do. The way around it for Theresa May is far from clear. Third Brexit vote must be different - Speaker Third Brexit vote on same motion ruled out.

Erdogan criticised for showing NZ video# Social sites seek to stop NZ attack clips The 'precious' mosque where peace was shattered Mr Peters said he fully supported the prime minister on the issue, adding: ""The reality is that after 1pm on Friday, our world changed forever and so will our laws."" Ms Ardern said: ""We have made a decision as a cabinet. We are unified."" She also announced that an inquiry would look into the lead-up to the attacks, and what might have been done differently. At the weekend, Ms Ardern said the suspect had a gun licence, obtained in November 2017, and owned five guns. Weaponry shown in the footage circulating of the attack Earlier on Monday, gun retailer Gun City said it had sold four weapons to the alleged gunman online, but it did not sell him the high-powered weapon used in the mosque shootings. CEO David Tipple told a news conference in Christchurch it had only sold him A-category weapons. Under New Zealand's gun laws, A-category weapons can be semi-automatic but limited to seven shots. Video footage of the attacks appeared to show the gunman's weapon had a magazine with a larger capacity, which is also available legally. There are an estimated 1.5 million privately owned firearms in the country. This video can not be played Christchurch students perform Haka for shooting victims Since the attack there have been calls for semi-automatic weapons to be banned. Previous attempts to tighten gun laws have failed due to a strong gun lobby and a culture of hunting. The minimum legal age to own a gun in New Zealand is 16, or 18 for military-style semi-automatic weapons. Anyone over those ages who is considered by police to be ""fit and proper"" can possess a firearm All gun-owners must have a licence, but most individual weapons do not have to be registered. New Zealand is one of the few countries where this is the case Applicants for a firearms licence must pass a background check of criminal and medical records Once a licence has been issued, gun owners can buy as many weapons as they want Footage of the killings was live-streamed by the attacker. On Sunday police said it was now classified as an objectionable publication and therefore it was an offence to distribute or possess the material. How the attacks unfolded More about the suspect An 18-year-old appeared in court on Monday, charged with distributing the live-stream. The teenager was also charged with publishing a photograph of the mosque with the message ""target acquired"" and faces a maximum of 14 years in prison for each charge, according to the prosecution. Facebook said it had removed 1.5 million videos of the attack around the world in the first 24 hours. By Jay Savage, BBC News, Christchurch Many returned to work and school on Monday, but little about it felt ordinary. If anything, the signs of the city's emotions became more visible. Flowers left at the main tribute site swelled, easily doubling what was there a day earlier. Outside Al Noor mosque, hundreds of people attended an afternoon vigil. It featured a thundering haka, performed by dozens of schoolchildren. Other students stood together singing softly or linking arms in silence. A few cried openly. The importance of coming together was the main topic of conversation. This video can not be played New Zealand church-goers rally to help mosque attack victims Nine people remain in hospital in a critical condition. This video can not be played Farid Ahmed: ""I have forgiven him and I will pray for him"" Frustration is building among relatives over the release of the bodies of the dead for burial. The first release was approved on Sunday but the family say another relative was killed and they want them released together. No burials will take place on Monday. Islamic tradition calls for the cleansing and burial of bodies as soon as possible after death. Brenton Tarrant on Monday fired his state-appointed lawyer, Richard Peters. Mr Peters says the defendant has indicated he ""wants to be self-represented in this case"". Brenton Tarrant appeared in court on Saturday charged with murder. Images of the defendant must be shown obscured under New Zealand law The lawyer added: ""The way he presented was rational and someone who was not suffering any mental disability. He seemed to understand what was going on."" Australian police raided two homes near Sydney on Mondayas part of the inquiry. Australian media reported that one of the homes belongs to Brenton Tarrant's sister. The family is co-operating with the authorities. An uncle of Brenton Tarrant said: ""We are so sorry for the families over there, for the dead and injured."" New Zealand police confirmed on Monday they believed there was only one attacker, but added that this did not rule out others might have provided support.

"Artwork: The fireball was the kind of event expected to happen only two to three times per century A huge fireball exploded in the Earth's atmosphere in December, according to Nasa. The blast was thesecond largest of its kind in 30 years,external, and the biggest since the fireball over Chelyabinsk in Russia six years ago. But it went largely unnoticed until now because it blew up over the Bering Sea, off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula. The space rock exploded with 10 times the energy released by the Hiroshima atomic bomb. Lindley Johnson, planetary defence officer at Nasa, told BBC News a fireball this big is only expected about two or three times every 100 years. Allow Twitter content?

At about noon local time on 18 December, the asteroid barrelled through the atmosphere at a speed of 32km/s (20 miles per second) , on a steep trajectory of seven degrees. Measuring several metres in size, the space rock exploded 25.6km above the Earth's surface, with an impact energy of 173 kilotons. ""That was 40% the energy release of Chelyabinsk, but it was over the Bering Sea so it didn't have the same type of effect or show up in the news,"" said Kelly Fast, near-Earth objects observations programme manager at Nasa. ""That's another thing we have in our defence, there's plenty of water on the planet."" Dr Fast was discussing the event here at the50th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in The Woodlands, near Houston, Texas.,external What could end the world as we know it? Asteroid impact risks 'underplayed' Military satellites picked up the blast last year; Nasa was notified of the event by the US Air Force. Dr Johnson said the fireball came in over an area not too far from routes used by commercial planes flying between North America and Asia. So researchers have been checking with airlines to see if there were any reported sightings of the event. In 2005, Congress tasked Nasa with finding 90% of near-Earth asteroids of 140m (460ft) in size or larger by 2020. Space rocks of this size are so-called ""problems without passports"" because they are expected to affect whole regions if they collide with Earth. But scientists estimate it will take them another 30 years to fulfil this congressional directive.

The meteor trail was seen by Nasa's Terra satellite Once an incoming object is identified, Nasa has had some notable success at calculating where on Earth the impact will occur, based on a precise determination of its orbit. In June 2018, the small 3m (10ft) asteroid 2018 LA was discovered by a ground-based observatory in Arizona eight hours before impact. The Center for Near-Earth Object Studies at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) then made a precision determination of its orbit, which was used to calculate a probable impact location. This showed the rock was likely to hit southern Africa. Just as the calculation suggested, a fireball was recorded over Botswana by security camera footage on a farm. Fragments of the object were later found in the area. Japan's Himawari satellite captures the fireball's steep descent This video can not be played Eyewitnesses and CCTV cameras captured the moment the Chelyabinsk meteor flew across the sky The latest event over the Bering Sea shows that larger objects can collide with us without warning, underlining the need for enhanced monitoring. A more robust network would be dependent not only on ground telescopes, but space-based observatories also. A mission concept in development would see a telescope called NeoCam launched to a gravitational balance point in space, where it would discover and characterise potentially hazardous asteroids larger than 140m. Dr Amy Mainzer, chief scientist on NeoCam at JPL, said: ""The idea is really to get as close as possible to reaching that 90% goal of finding the 140m and larger near-Earth asteroids given to Nasa by Congress. She said that if the mission did not launch, projections suggested it would ""take us many decades to get there with the existing suite of ground-based surveys"". Dr Mainzer added: ""But if you have an IR-based (infrared) telescope, it goes a lot faster.""

"OWNAFC enables users to ""take charge of a real life football club"", the firm's website said Football fans who say they thought they were buying a share in a ""real life club"" are demanding their money back from an app firm. Thousands signed up to OWNAFC after its director said it would enable them to make decisions over the running of a club it took over. Customers said they thought paying Â£49 would mean they had a share in a club and be entitled to help run it. But OWNAFC denies wrongdoing and said the Â£49 was to access the app. It said shares would only be on offer once a club was bought. Gunnercooke LLP, legal adviser to OWNAFC, said it accepted the business needed to be more open with customers. Hednesford Town FC had considered a takeover by the app but a ""collective decision"" was made to not go ahead. Some of the tasks OWNAFC members thought they would be in control of One customer, who wished to be known as Nicholas, said: ""I paid the money on behalf of my 13-year-old son because it seemed really exciting. ""But after I paid... we received an email about FAQs and in there it said I hadn't paid for a share, but that we would be 'entitled' to a share. ""My son is really upset. He had spent his own money on this and now there appears to be no recourse."" The firm's brochure said customers would have the option of buying a share of a club at the nominal value In a statement issued on behalf of OWNAFC founder and director Stuart Harvey, Gunnercooke LLP said: ""In no way has the business done any wrongdoing and we strongly reject any accusations of fraud. ""The concept for OWNAFC was aimed at allowing fans to take an active part in the running of a football club via a mobile application."" A spokesman said those who paid Â£49 unlocked features of the app ""allowing them to engage in the experience of running a real football club, by making all boardroom decisions upon deal completion and takeover"". He added: ""All OWNAs, subject to age restrictions, will be entitled to one share in the limited entity that takes over the club. However, it is not mandatory for an OWNA to take a share if they choose not to."" A non-executive advisory board is being appointed and, as part of this move, Mr Harvey will be stepping aside from the business, added Gunnercooke LLP. Mr Harvey said he had closed down the company's social media pages due to online abuse and threats to his family. The company's brochure says customers will own one share of a football club the firm takes over if they choose to The company brochure stated that ""All OWNAs will have the option of buying one share within the club at the nominal value"". It also said that the choice of club to take over would be ""the first decision that you and your fellow OWNAs will make"". But customers said they were still unclear as to what their Â£49 bought them. A customer, who only wanted to be known as Mark, said: ""It's about the fact that 99.9% of the people who paid, like me, are just genuine football fans wanting to be part of something that could make a difference."" The company's website also said ""by making payment of Â£49, you are securing your position as football club OWNA and unlocking all features of the OWNAFC app"". It also said ""once the club purchase is complete, you will unlock the app features and really put your theories into practice"".

Watchdog Action Fraud confirmed it had received reports relating to OWNAFC within the past two weeks and, as part of its process, informs the National Fraud Intelligence bureau, which then contacts the relevant police force. Greater Manchester Police, the force in which the business is registered, said it had not yet received any reports. One of the clauses in the website's terms section states that refunds are only offered ""if a takeover is not completed within three months of a club accepting our offer"".

"A payment processing firm that used to be owned by Royal Bank of Scotland has been sold in a deal worth $43bn (Â£32bn). WorldPay has been bought by Florida-based Fidelity National Information Services (FIS) for $35bn in cash and shares, plus WorldPay's debt. Customers of WorldPay include TopShop, Clarks, Monsoon, Accessorize and multiple pub and restaurant chains. FIS sells payment services and also software for the finance industry. WorldPay was sold by RBS in 2010 as a condition of the bank's bailout following the financial crisis. Since then WorldPay's value has risen dramatically and now matches the stock market value of its former owner RBS. Demand for WorldPay services has surged as shoppers are using their cards more, either to buy products online, or using cards in shops. FIS said buying WorldPay would help it sell more services to banks and other financial firms. The company's chief executive Gary Norcross said ""scale matters in our rapidly changing industry"". The rise of financial technology firms, known as fintech, has seen technology firms taking on banks in a race for control of the digital payments market. ""The need to invest, to continue to modernise both the technology and application layers, and continue to innovate so our customers can continue to be disrupters, will be important for us,"" Mr Norcross told investors in a call on Monday. Neil Wilson, from Markets.com, said the deal ""signifies the very rapid shift in the payments industry and the amount of investment the businesses need"". He expects more deals in the sector as companies look to get bigger. Gareth Wilson, Accenture's global payments chief, said the deal was ""huge"" for the industry, in particular because it ""puts a price on the expected value of disruption"" in the industry. ""The structure of the industry is ripe for change, and payments is the battleground for new activity,"" he said. According to Accenture, in 2017 in Europe, 20% of all 1,400 financial services firms were considered to be ""new"", because they had started after 2005. The UK has seen a ""huge rise"" in fintech, because it has led the way in liberalising the banking industry. There are now 2.5 times more financial services companies in Britain than in 2005, and 91% of these firms are offering payments services. WorldPay first started in 1989 as electronic payments system Streamline. It was owned by NatWest Bank, which was then acquired by RBS in 2002. WorldPay first started as Streamline in the UK in 1989 Streamline was renamed as RBS WorldPay. RBS expanded the service to other countries, including the US and the Netherlands. In 2009 the European Commission said that RBS would have to sell WorldPay and other businesses, as a condition of approving state aid to the bank. The next year, WorldPay was sold to private equity firms Advent International and Bain Capital for Â£2bn, with RBS retaining a 20% stake. In 2013, RBS sold off its remaining stake. WorldPay went on to sell shares on the London Stock Exchange in 2015. In January 2018, US payments processing technology firm Vantiv acquired WorldPay for $10.4bn. Vantiv renamed the combined firms WorldPay. Last October, BT poached WorldPay's co-headPhilip Jansen to replace Gavin Patterson as chief executive of the telecoms group.

"Kate Nash started out by uploading her music on MySpace MySpace, one of the first online social networks, has apologised after a server migration caused a huge loss of data. A message on its website says that ""any photos, videos and audio files"" uploaded more than three years ago may no longer be available. There had been complaints going back several months that links to music were no longer working. The platform has waned in popularity since it was founded in 2003 but in its prime it attracted millions of users. In 2006 it wasthe most visited site in the US - beating Google. It was a popular platform for sharing new music, and has been credited with helping to launch the careers of artists including the Arctic Monkeys and Kate Nash. ""As a result of a server migration project, any photos, videos, and audio files you uploaded more than three years ago may no longer be available on or from MySpace,"" the firm said in a statement. ""We apologize for the inconvenience."" It also included the email address of its data protection officer Dr Jana Jentzsch. The BBC has contacted Dr Jentzsch for comment. Andy Baio, who helped build the Kickstarter crowd-funding site, tweeted that the loss could amount to some 50 million tracks by 14 million artists over that period.

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn says there is a ""degree of exasperation"" in Europe and in Parliament about the way the PM has dealt with Brexit. He says he made it clear in Brussels yesterday that there is no support for Theresa May's deal, but there is support for other options. Mr Corbyn says Parliament may have a series of indicative votes on Wednesday afternoon next week - which he says it a ""very promising way around the impasse"". DUP deputy leader Nigel
Dodds says the PM ""missed an opportunity"" at the EU summit to put forward proposals that could have ""improved the prospects of an acceptable withdrawal agreement"". He says ""nothing has changed"" in respect of the withdrawal agreement. ""Nothing fundamentally turns on the formal ratification of documents which
the Attorney General has already said do not change the risk of the UK being
trapped in the backstop,"" he says. ""The DUP has been very clear throughout that we want a deal which
delivers on the referendum result and which works for all parts of the UK and
for the EU as well. ""But it must be a deal that protects the union. ""That remains our
abiding principle. We will not accept any deal which poses a long term risk to
the constitutional and economic integrity of the United Kingdom.â Speaking on the delay to Brexit, Taoiseach (Irish PM) Leo Varadkar says: ""There won't be further extensions. ""We've set out now what the timeline is and in many ways the European Union has taken control of the timeline, which in the past had been set by the UK."" Mr Macron says ""it is clear"" the British people made a decision ""without having all the information"". He says Brexit was a ""sovereign decision"" that was ""based on fake news"".

German Chancellor Angela Merkel has welcomed the decision on a Brexit delay. She tells reporters: ""We have, for the time being, prevented a no-deal Brexit for the 29th. ""But these are very short periods of time, so Britain will have to make clear yet again which path it wishes to pursue. ""With the debate we had yesterday night, we proved yet again that what we have done for the past two years will continue to apply, because as 27 member states, we work together and act together."" Asked whether the decision to delay Brexit had allowed Theresa May to ""kick the can further down the road"", European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker says: ""The road the can has in perspective is a very short one."" He jokes about the themes of this week's talks on EU relations with the UK and China. ""We did not talk only about the United Kingdom, but also about China,"" he says. ""The discussion on China was easier than the discussion on the UK. ""Not because China would like to join the EU, but because China isn't leaving.""

"Jeremy Hunt has been meeting other European foreign ministers A ""lot more work"" is required to get MPs to back Theresa May's Brexit deal, Jeremy Hunt has said, amid uncertainty over whether it will be put to a vote for a third time this week. The foreign secretary said there were ""encouraging signs"" that opponents of the deal were slowly coming round. But he said another vote would only be held before Thursday's EU summit if ministers were ""confident"" of victory. A number of Brexiteers have signalled they will continue to oppose the deal. Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson called for further changes to the terms of withdrawal, which the EU has rejected,while 22 Tory MPs have written to the Daily Telegraph,externalsaying that leaving without any agreement - known as a no-deal exit - on 29 March would actually be a ""good deal"" for the UK. Although the PM's plan is expected to be voted on for a third time in the coming days, the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the situation remained highly unpredictable. She said it was ""eminently feasible"" the PM would delay a vote until after Thursday's summit - at which European leaders will discuss a UK request to extend the Brexit process and delay the UK's departure. Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Brexit: A really simple guide No Brexit deal vote 'without DUP support' Last week,MPs rejected Theresa May's deal for a second time- this time by 149 votes - and then backed plans to rule out leaving the EU without a deal. They alsovoted in favour of an extension to the process- either until 30 June, if the deal is supported before 20 March; or a longer one that could include taking part in European elections if MPs reject her plan again. All 27 EU member states would have to agree to an extension. The prime minister has already had two attempts at getting her deal through Parliament The possibility of Brexit being delayed or overturned in another referendum has seen some MPs reluctantly back Mrs May's deal. A group of 15 Tory MPs from Leave-backing constituencies, including former Brexit Secretary David Davis, wrote a letter urging colleagues to back the deal to ensure Brexit goes ahead.

Speaking as he arrived in Brussels for a meeting of EU foreign ministers, Mr Hunt welcomed the fact ""strong critics"" of the deal were now prepared to support it in order to prevent the risk of ""paralysis"". ""I think there are some cautious signs of encouragement,"" he said. ""But there is a lot more work to do...That is why we will be redoubling our efforts this week."" Asked if a third vote would definitely happen before Thursday's EU summit, he said he hoped it will but ""we have to be confident we will get the numbers"". Boris Johnson and other Brexiteers say they still want changes to the agreement So far the number of Tories publicly switching positions falls far short of the 75 MPs Mrs May needs to switch sides. Andrea Jenkyns told BBC News she was a ""conviction politician...and would not be bullied into backing the deal"" while Lee Rowley told Politics Live he could not support the deal as it stood as a ""matter of principle"". Writing in his weekly Daily Telegraph column,external, Mr Johnson warned the UK would be ""humiliated"" if there was not a radical change of approach. Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button Jacob Rees-Mogg, chair of the European Research Group of Tory Brexiteers, said he was ""waiting to see"" whether the Democratic Unionists would swing round behind the deal before deciding which way to vote. But he said he still believed leaving without any agreement was the ""best option"", telling LBC ""it means... we will have restored our nation's independence"". Senior ministers have indicated the support of the DUP's 10 MPs, whose votes prop up the Conservative government, remains crucial. No 10 confirmed negotiations with the DUP were continuing, including over the question of how the Northern Ireland Assembly could block any new regulatory barriers to trade with the rest of the UK. DUP MLA Jim Wells told BBC Radio 4's Today the party still had a ""huge difficulty"" with the existing backstop arrangements - designed to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland but which opponents say will separate Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. He said: ""We could find ourselves locked in there forever in effect - and once you get in, you can never get out."" With UK politics mired in a fog of confusion, the only thing the EU can control this week is choreography at their leaders' summit. Donald Tusk, European Council President and the representative of all 27 EU countries in Brussels, is visiting a number of capitals to try to co-ordinate a single EU response if or when Mrs May asks for an extension to Article 50. On Monday, he's in Berlin and Paris - capitals of the EU superpowers, Germany and France. But when it comes to an extension, any of the EU's 27 leaders has a veto. The decision must be unanimous. This conjures up horror visions in EU leaders' minds over being held to ransom by one of their ranks keen to use this leverage over Brexit to win a concession from Brussels over a separate issue.

"Police released this image of Gokmen Tanis A man has been arrested after three people were killed and five wounded, some seriously, in a shooting on a tram in the Dutch city of Utrecht. Gokmen Tanis, a 37-year-old born in Turkey, was found several hours after the attack in a building about two miles (3km) from the scene. Authorities said the attacker's motive was unclear. Police raided several properties and arrested two others in connection with the incident, Dutch media reported. The shooting sparked a city-wide manhunt and the closure of schools. At about 10:45 local time (09:45 GMT), police were called to reports of a shooting on board one of the city's trams at the 24 Oktoberplein junction. One witness told local media that ""a man started shooting wildly"". Several of the injured were said to be in a critical condition. This video can not be played Dutch attack eyewitness: ""I heard people yell: Shooting, shooting"" Another witness told Dutch public broadcaster NOS that he had helped an injured woman when the tram came to an emergency stop. ""I looked behind me and saw someone lying there behind the tram,"" he said. ""People got out of their cars... and they started to lift her up. ""I helped to pull her out and then I saw a gunman run towards us, with his gun raised,"" he said. ""I heard people yell 'Shooter! Shooter!' and I started to run."" The gunman then fled the scene, leading to the manhunt which lasted for much of Monday. Schools were closed and security was increased at airports and mosques while counter-terrorism police worked to locate the suspect. A photograph of him was posted on social media by police, who warned people against approaching him. A number of raids were reportedly carried out and counter-terrorism officers were pictured patrolling the streets near to where the attack happened. Police surrounded a building not far from the scene of the attack and arrested Mr Tanis on Monday evening. Police said the shooting appeared to be a terrorist incident but, at a press conference on Monday evening, a prosecutor said it could have been motivated by ""family reasons"". Mr Tanis was known to Dutch police, the prosecutor added. The threat level was temporarily raised to its highest point in the province of Utrecht Prime Minister Mark Rutte said the country had been ""jolted by an attack"", which he described as ""deeply disturbing"". ""There are many questions and rumours,"" he said. ""It is unclear what the motives are behind this attack."" He said local elections would go ahead as planned on Wednesday but flags would be flown at half-mast. Leaders from around the world, including French President Emmanuel Macron and Spanish Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez, offered their condolences. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said the EU ""stands side by side with the Netherlands and its people during these difficult times."" Police surrounded a house earlier on Monday The threat level in Utrecht was reduced following the arrest. It had earlier been raised to its highest level and paramilitary police posted to airports and mosques. Utrecht University closed all its buildings and trains were not allowed to run into the city's central station. Utrecht, the Netherlands' fourth largest city, has a population of about 340,000. Crime levels are low and gun killings are rare, which is the case for much of the country.

"The IRD faked a press release to discredit the Communist-backed World Federation of Democratic Youth British government officials forged documents to produce ""fake news stories"" during the Cold War, newly released files show. The Information Research Department (IRD) was the Foreign Office's secret propaganda unit. For 30 years it fed information to journalists and had its own news agencies too. Almost 2,000 of its files have been transferred to the National Archives since the start of 2019. The files cover the early 1960s - the heyday of the IRD, when it employed between 400 and 600 people, according to Paul Lashmar, author of Britain's Secret Propaganda War. In 1978, Mr Lashmar was part of the team of journalists who revealed the existence of the IRD. He says this is the first time their role faking documents has been exposed. The team was funded by the so-called ""secret vote"" - where government money not subject to parliamentary scrutiny was used. Part of the project involved working abroad, but it also fed information to London-based academics and correspondents. The Berlin wall, dividing the east and west of the German city, was a famous symbol of the Cold War Among the newly released files are lists of trusted journalists. In 1960 that included Neal Ascherson - then a young reporter at the Observer newspaper who was introduced to the IRD by Edward Crankshaw, a more senior Soviet specialist. ""I was taken to a London club and we had a nice lunch with Edward and myself and this gentleman,"" Mr Ascherson remembered. ""After I'd been looked over and tested... I was allowed to receive the news bulletin of eastern European 'product'."" The IRD information was delivered by hand and treated as secret - but Mr Ascherson said he ""very rapidly discovered it was completely useless"", since it contained ""stale, out of date"" news. He found the analysis ""childishâ¦ very cold warrior"", and says he never relied on the information. According to Mr Lashmar, the officials at the IRD were enjoying the game, competing with the other side. One complex scheme involved faking a press release from the World Federation of Democratic Youth (WFYD), a Communist-backed organisation based in Budapest. In 1963, African students in Bulgaria made international news. Scores had left the country, claiming racial discrimination, and the IRD decided to use this to ""intensify indignation... against Bloc countries"". National Archives missing 400 files Hong Kong-to-NI 'spoof' revealed On fake headed notepaper, the IRD circulated a press release to hundreds of newspapers and opinion formers - sending the releases via the British diplomatic bag which meant they would have the right postmark. The press release - reprinted in full by a news agency in Zanzibar - included an offensive statement that the Africans ""emerging from the jungle darkness of want, [they] were not equipped to understand that food, fuel and clothes were not freely attainable..."" African students were furious. The Nigerian student union said this was a declaration of ""white superiority"". Some weeks later, the WFYD insisted it had been a fake release. Most of the IRD's efforts were concentrated on foreign news, but occasionally they were employed in the UK. In 1962 Labour MP for Islington North, Gerry Reynolds, asked for their help. He feared his local Labour party was being taken over by ""a well-organised group of extreme left-wing malcontents, probably Trotskyists"", and wanted the IRD to dig up any information on the individuals concerned. A fake copy of the Times from North Korea, with communist propaganda inside The IRD turned to the security services, which confirmed that Dorothy Hayward had been a member of the Revolutionary Communist Party in 1947; that Sidney Lubin had endorsed a Communist council candidate in 1951; and that Francis Dunne had distributed a Trotskyite newsletter. This information was ""a bit stingy"", wrote one IRD officer whose disappointment suggested he had expected more information. Nonetheless, he passed it on to Mr Reynolds, who remained the MP there until 1969. It is not known what - if anything - happened to those people the IRD had named. The files show the IRD manufactured and distributed statements from the International Institute for Peace in Vienna on several occasions. It also faked posters from the International Union of Students, replacing the acronym ""US"" with Chinese characters, to turn an anti-US nuclear campaign into an anti-Chinese one. This is the first time that IRD's own forgeries have been revealed. At the time, it was keen to highlight forged documents produced by the Communists. They were known to be prolific: at one point a forged British cabinet paper was being circulated amongst African leaders. In North Korea and East Germany, such fakes were produced on an industrial scale, according to files recently released. Mr Lashmar said: ""Should a democracy be secretly putting out fake or forged material? No. If totalitarian people are manipulating thingsâ¦ that doesn't mean we should follow suit.""

"This video can not be played Speaker John Bercow rejects further Brexit votes without changes to motion Speaker John Bercow has thrown the UK's Brexit plans into further confusion by ruling out another vote on the PM's deal unless MPs are given a new motion. In a surprise ruling, he said he would not allow a third ""meaningful vote"" in the coming days on ""substantially the same"" motion as MPs rejected last week. With 11 days to go before the UK is due to leave the EU, ministers have warned of a looming ""constitutional crisis"". The UK is currently due to leave the EU on 29 March. Theresa May has negotiated the withdrawal deal with the EU but it must also be agreed by MPs. They have voted against it twice, and the government has been considering a third attempt to get it through Parliament. Mr Bercow cited a convention dating back to 1604 that a defeated motion could not be brought back in the same form during the course of a parliamentary session. He said the second vote on the prime minister's deal last week was ""in order"" as it was substantially different to the first, but any further votes must pass the ""test"" he set out to be allowed. Brexit extension debated by MPs Brexit: What could happen next? Can May still bring back her Brexit deal? Bercow chucks a spanner in the works Listen: Brexitcast - Erskine Mayhem The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the speaker's intervention does not stop Brexit from happening, but it makes it ""extremely unlikely"" that the government will put another vote on the deal to Parliament this week. She said this makes it less likely the prime minister will ask EU leaders at a summit this week for a short extension - which Mrs May had said she would do if her deal got through Parliament. This in turn makes it more likely there will be a longer delay to Brexit, she added. She said: ""The conclusion that most people in Westminster would reach from that means that we're heading - it's likely - towards a closer relationship with the European Union, a softer Brexit than the one Theresa May has set out."" However, she added: ""That said, the government does believe that, although they're not clear about what it might be yet,  there is a way round this complication - but it is another significant obstacle for Number 10 tonight and it has, in the words of one senior official, made things significantly more complicated."" Mr Bercow's statement appeared to take Downing Street by surprise, with the prime minister's official spokesman saying it had not been warned of its contents ""or indeed the fact that he was making one"". Later, a Number 10 spokesman said the statement had been noted and required ""proper consideration"". The role of the speaker, who is the highest authority of the House of Commons, includes controlling debates, calling MPs to speak and choosing which amendments can be debated. Analysis by BBC political correspondent Iain Watson How can the government get another vote on Theresa May's deal? Well, first of all, rules are there to be changed. If MPs suspend or change the ""standing orders"" of Parliament, they could get the Brexit deal back on the agenda. Secondly, the government could change the proposition on offer. The former Attorney General Dominic Grieve has suggested that something ""substantially"" different would be to ask Parliament to vote for the deal subject to a referendum. Or change the Parliament? If MPs can't discuss the same thing in the same session of Parliament, why not simply start a new one? Read Iain's complete analysis here. The prime minister had been expected to submit her Brexit deal for MPs to vote on for a third time this week - a week afterthey rejected itby 149 votes - and ahead of the EU summit on Thursday. Last week MPs also voted in favour of ruling out leaving the EU without a deal, andin favour of extending the Brexit process- though an extension would have to be agreed by all 27 EU member states. Brexit minister Kwasi Kwarteng has confirmed Mrs May will be writing to European Council President Donald Tusk to ask to postpone the UK's exit date. If the EU agreed, the government would ask both Houses of Parliament to approve the change, he said. Mr Kwarteng said the length of the extension would depend on ""whether the meaningful vote goes through or not"". ""If we have a deal... we will ask for a short extension,"" he said. ""Now if for whatever reason that vote doesn't happen, or is frustrated or is voted down, we will probably ask for a long extension of the period - and that would be a matter for the EU and for our government to decide."" European leaders are expected to discuss the UK request to extend the Brexit process and delay the UK's departure at the summit on Thursday. Shadow Brexit minister Matthew Pennycook said the fact that Article 50 needed to be extended was ""a mark of this government's failure"". Meanwhile, the government has been trying to convince the DUP and Tory Brexiteers, who have both voiced concerns about the backstop - the controversial arrangement to prevent physical checks on the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland - to vote in favour of the deal. The DUP has opposed the deal up to now and are seeking further ""clarifications"" on the government's legal advice about the backstop, and how the UK could exit it. Ministers and MPs supportive of Mrs May's deal expressed anger at the timing of Mr Bercow's intervention. Conservative MP James Gray, who plans to vote for the deal after rejecting it twice, said he was ""absolutely furious""; while fellow Tory Greg Hands suggested Mr Bercow was the only person in the country who was ""accountable to nobody"". Solicitor General Robert Buckland warned there was now a ""constitutional crisis"" and suggested the onus was on the EU to come up with ""new solutions"" to enable MPs to vote on the deal again. ""Frankly we could have done without this, but it is something we are going to have to deal with,"" he said. He suggested ""there were ways around this"" - including potentially cutting short the current session of Parliament, a move which would lead to calls for a general election. Some opponents of the PM's Brexit deal welcomed the Speaker's ruling. Conservative former cabinet minister Owen Paterson said it was a ""game-changer"" and would ""concentrate minds"" ahead of Thursday's EU summit. Sir Bill Cash, chairman of the European Scrutiny Committee, said it seemed to make an ""enormous amount of sense"" given that the Brexit deal has been defeated twice and there would need to be a ""substantial difference"" to allow a third vote. But the SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford suggested there was now a ""constitutional crisis"" and he suggested the prime minister should ""immediately"" call a meeting of opposition leaders. And Brexiteer Nadhim Zahawi, Tory minister for children and families, told BBC Newsnight that the Speaker had ""made it now much more difficult to have the short extension"" and a meaningful vote, ""therefore the longer extension is now clearly on the table. I don't believe that's a good thing"". By BBC Brussels reporter Adam Fleming The EU's official position is that they are waiting for Theresa May to come to a summit in Brussels on Thursday with a clear statement about how she plans to proceed, and there definitely won't be any more negotiations when she gets here. Unofficially, EU officials wonder if the government can get itself out of this situation, either with Parliamentary wizardry or by coming up with UK-only additions to the package, such as new guarantees about the role of Northern Ireland's Stormont Assembly in the future. And could the joint UK/EU decision about an extension to the Brexit process, due to be taken on Thursday, be appended to the deal and then count as something new enough to justify another vote in the Commons?

"Kate Nash started out by uploading her music on MySpace MySpace, one of the first online social networks, has apologised after a server migration caused a huge loss of data. A message on its website says that ""any photos, videos and audio files"" uploaded more than three years ago may no longer be available. There had been complaints going back several months that links to music were no longer working. The platform has waned in popularity since it was founded in 2003 but in its prime it attracted millions of users. In 2006 it wasthe most visited site in the US - beating Google. It was a popular platform for sharing new music, and has been credited with helping to launch the careers of artists including the Arctic Monkeys and Kate Nash. ""As a result of a server migration project, any photos, videos, and audio files you uploaded more than three years ago may no longer be available on or from MySpace,"" the firm said in a statement. ""We apologize for the inconvenience."" It also included the email address of its data protection officer Dr Jana Jentzsch. The BBC has contacted Dr Jentzsch for comment. Andy Baio, who helped build the Kickstarter crowd-funding site, tweeted that the loss could amount to some 50 million tracks by 14 million artists over that period. He also questioned whether the loss was accidental. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"OWNAFC enables users to ""take charge of a real life football club"", the firm's website said Football fans who say they thought they were buying a share in a ""real life club"" are demanding their money back from an app firm. Thousands signed up to OWNAFC after its director said it would enable them to make decisions over the running of a club it took over. Customers said they thought paying Â£49 would mean they had a share in a club and be entitled to help run it. But OWNAFC denies wrongdoing and said the Â£49 was to access the app. It said shares would only be on offer once a club was bought. Gunnercooke LLP, legal adviser to OWNAFC, said it accepted the business needed to be more open with customers. Hednesford Town FC had considered a takeover by the app but a ""collective decision"" was made to not go ahead. Some of the tasks OWNAFC members thought they would be in control of One customer, who wished to be known as Nicholas, said: ""I paid the money on behalf of my 13-year-old son because it seemed really exciting. ""But after I paid... we received an email about FAQs and in there it said I hadn't paid for a share, but that we would be 'entitled' to a share. ""My son is really upset. He had spent his own money on this and now there appears to be no recourse."" The firm's brochure said customers would have the option of buying a share of a club at the nominal value In a statement issued on behalf of OWNAFC founder and director Stuart Harvey, Gunnercooke LLP said: ""In no way has the business done any wrongdoing and we strongly reject any accusations of fraud. ""The concept for OWNAFC was aimed at allowing fans to take an active part in the running of a football club via a mobile application."" A spokesman said those who paid Â£49 unlocked features of the app ""allowing them to engage in the experience of running a real football club, by making all boardroom decisions upon deal completion and takeover"". He added: ""All OWNAs, subject to age restrictions, will be entitled to one share in the limited entity that takes over the club. However, it is not mandatory for an OWNA to take a share if they choose not to."" A non-executive advisory board is being appointed and, as part of this move, Mr Harvey will be stepping aside from the business, added Gunnercooke LLP. Mr Harvey said he had closed down the company's social media pages due to online abuse and threats to his family. The company's brochure says customers will own one share of a football club the firm takes over if they choose to The company brochure stated that ""All OWNAs will have the option of buying one share within the club at the nominal value"". It also said that the choice of club to take over would be ""the first decision that you and your fellow OWNAs will make"". But customers said they were still unclear as to what their Â£49 bought them. A customer, who only wanted to be known as Mark, said: ""It's about the fact that 99.9% of the people who paid, like me, are just genuine football fans wanting to be part of something that could make a difference."" The company's website also said ""by making payment of Â£49, you are securing your position as football club OWNA and unlocking all features of the OWNAFC app"". It also said ""once the club purchase is complete, you will unlock the app features and really put your theories into practice"". Running a football club via a phone app The real life 'Football Manager' club Latest news from the West Midlands Meanwhile, customers have been applying for refunds through their bank. Watchdog Action Fraud confirmed it had received reports relating to OWNAFC within the past two weeks and, as part of its process, informs the National Fraud Intelligence bureau, which then contacts the relevant police force. Greater Manchester Police, the force in which the business is registered, said it had not yet received any reports. One of the clauses in the website's terms section states that refunds are only offered ""if a takeover is not completed within three months of a club accepting our offer"". ""If no offer is made to a football club by 01/06/2019 then refunds will be offered"", it says.

"A payment processing firm that used to be owned by Royal Bank of Scotland has been sold in a deal worth $43bn (Â£32bn). WorldPay has been bought by Florida-based Fidelity National Information Services (FIS) for $35bn in cash and shares, plus WorldPay's debt. Customers of WorldPay include TopShop, Clarks, Monsoon, Accessorize and multiple pub and restaurant chains. FIS sells payment services and also software for the finance industry. WorldPay was sold by RBS in 2010 as a condition of the bank's bailout following the financial crisis. Since then WorldPay's value has risen dramatically and now matches the stock market value of its former owner RBS. Demand for WorldPay services has surged as shoppers are using their cards more, either to buy products online, or using cards in shops. FIS said buying WorldPay would help it sell more services to banks and other financial firms. The company's chief executive Gary Norcross said ""scale matters in our rapidly changing industry"". The rise of financial technology firms, known as fintech, has seen technology firms taking on banks in a race for control of the digital payments market. ""The need to invest, to continue to modernise both the technology and application layers, and continue to innovate so our customers can continue to be disrupters, will be important for us,"" Mr Norcross told investors in a call on Monday. Neil Wilson, from Markets.com, said the deal ""signifies the very rapid shift in the payments industry and the amount of investment the businesses need"". He expects more deals in the sector as companies look to get bigger. Gareth Wilson, Accenture's global payments chief, said the deal was ""huge"" for the industry, in particular because it ""puts a price on the expected value of disruption"" in the industry. ""The structure of the industry is ripe for change, and payments is the battleground for new activity,"" he said. According to Accenture, in 2017 in Europe, 20% of all 1,400 financial services firms were considered to be ""new"", because they had started after 2005. The UK has seen a ""huge rise"" in fintech, because it has led the way in liberalising the banking industry. There are now 2.5 times more financial services companies in Britain than in 2005, and 91% of these firms are offering payments services. WorldPay first started in 1989 as electronic payments system Streamline. It was owned by NatWest Bank, which was then acquired by RBS in 2002. WorldPay first started as Streamline in the UK in 1989 Streamline was renamed as RBS WorldPay. RBS expanded the service to other countries, including the US and the Netherlands. In 2009 the European Commission said that RBS would have to sell WorldPay and other businesses, as a condition of approving state aid to the bank. The next year, WorldPay was sold to private equity firms Advent International and Bain Capital for Â£2bn, with RBS retaining a 20% stake. In 2013, RBS sold off its remaining stake. WorldPay went on to sell shares on the London Stock Exchange in 2015. In January 2018, US payments processing technology firm Vantiv acquired WorldPay for $10.4bn. Vantiv renamed the combined firms WorldPay. Last October, BT poached WorldPay's co-headPhilip Jansen to replace Gavin Patterson as chief executive of the telecoms group.

"This video can not be played Drone footage shows the devastation caused by Cyclone Idai The death toll in Mozambique from Cyclone Idai could be as high as 1,000, President Filipe Nyusi has said. Mr Nyusi flew over some of the worst-hit areas on Monday. He described seeing bodies floating in the rivers. The storm made landfall near the port city of Beira on Thursday with winds of up to 177 km/h (106 mph), but aid teams only reached the city on Sunday. A UN aid worker told the BBC that every building in Beira - home to half a million people - had been damaged. Gerald Bourke, from the UN's World Food Programme, said: ""No building is untouched. There is no power. There is no telecommunications. The streets are littered with fallen electricity lines. ""The roofs on so many houses have fallen in, likewise the walls. A lot of people in the city have lost their homes."" Rescue crews spent much of the night helping people from trees, Jamie LeSeur, the head of the IFRC assessment team, told the BBC.

"Ruth Maguire travelled to Carlingford on Saturday A body has been found in the search for a County Down woman missing after a hen party in the Republic of Ireland. Ruth Maguire, 30, a mother of three, travelled to Carlingford, County Louth, on Saturday, to celebrate with friends. The Newcastle woman was reported missing on Sunday morning after she failed to return from their night out. A search operation involving the RNLI, coastguard and divers from a local club has now ended following the discovery of a body in Carlingford Lough. Police said they believed the body was that of the missing woman. Ms Maguire, who was originally from Belfast, was part of a 32-strong group who had travelled to Carlingford to celebrate a forthcoming wedding. The group was staying at a house in the town and realised Ms Maguire had not returned after midnight. One of her friends told BBC News NI that her disappearance was ""completely out of character"". Friends had appealed for anyone with CCTV footage around the harbour area to check it.

"Budget hotel chain Travelodge is targeting parents who want to return to work to fill a potential post-Brexit staffing gap if EU worker numbers fall. It plans to open 100 new hotels creating 3,000 jobs by 2023, and says it hopes to attract parents by offering flexible hours and school hour roles. The firm, which in 2012 was on the brink of administration, reported strong sales and profits for last year. Travelodge said sales rose 8.8% to Â£693.3m in 2018.

But there are concerns that proposed regulations could dictate what type of workers are allowed to come to the UK after Brexit.

Chief executive Peter Gowers said he remained cautious on the short-term outlook for the firm, with trading for the first eight weeks of the year ""mixed"". He said strong growth in London was being offset by declining sales in the rest of the UK.

"OWNAFC enables users to ""take charge of a real life football club"", the firm's website said Football fans who say they thought they were buying a share in a ""real life club"" are demanding their money back from an app firm. Thousands signed up to OWNAFC after its director said it would enable them to make decisions over the running of a club it took over. Customers said they thought paying Â£49 would mean they had a share in a club and be entitled to help run it. But OWNAFC denies wrongdoing and said the Â£49 was to access the app. It said shares would only be on offer once a club was bought. Gunnercooke LLP, legal adviser to OWNAFC, said it accepted the business needed to be more open with customers. Hednesford Town FC had considered a takeover by the app but a ""collective decision"" was made to not go ahead. Some of the tasks OWNAFC members thought they would be in control of One customer, who wished to be known as Nicholas, said: ""I paid the money on behalf of my 13-year-old son because it seemed really exciting. ""But after I paid... we received an email about FAQs and in there it said I hadn't paid for a share, but that we would be 'entitled' to a share. ""My son is really upset. He had spent his own money on this and now there appears to be no recourse."" The firm's brochure said customers would have the option of buying a share of a club at the nominal value In a statement issued on behalf of OWNAFC founder and director Stuart Harvey, Gunnercooke LLP said: ""In no way has the business done any wrongdoing and we strongly reject any accusations of fraud. ""The concept for OWNAFC was aimed at allowing fans to take an active part in the running of a football club via a mobile application."" A spokesman said those who paid Â£49 unlocked features of the app ""allowing them to engage in the experience of running a real football club, by making all boardroom decisions upon deal completion and takeover"". He added: ""All OWNAs, subject to age restrictions, will be entitled to one share in the limited entity that takes over the club. However, it is not mandatory for an OWNA to take a share if they choose not to."" A non-executive advisory board is being appointed and, as part of this move, Mr Harvey will be stepping aside from the business, added Gunnercooke LLP. Mr Harvey said he had closed down the company's social media pages due to online abuse and threats to his family. The company's brochure says customers will own one share of a football club the firm takes over if they choose to The company brochure stated that ""All OWNAs will have the option of buying one share within the club at the nominal value"". It also said that the choice of club to take over would be ""the first decision that you and your fellow OWNAs will make"". But customers said they were still unclear as to what their Â£49 bought them. A customer, who only wanted to be known as Mark, said: ""It's about the fact that 99.9% of the people who paid, like me, are just genuine football fans wanting to be part of something that could make a difference."" The company's website also said ""by making payment of Â£49, you are securing your position as football club OWNA and unlocking all features of the OWNAFC app"". It also said ""once the club purchase is complete, you will unlock the app features and really put your theories into practice"".

Watchdog Action Fraud confirmed it had received reports relating to OWNAFC within the past two weeks and, as part of its process, informs the National Fraud Intelligence bureau, which then contacts the relevant police force. Greater Manchester Police, the force in which the business is registered, said it had not yet received any reports. One of the clauses in the website's terms section states that refunds are only offered ""if a takeover is not completed within three months of a club accepting our offer"".

"The infra-red images show the water saturation of the building A survey has revealed the water damage to the Hill House in Helensburgh. The property, designed by Charles Rennie Mackintosh, has been threatened by the effects of water penetration. Owners the National Trust for Scotland (NTS) and Historic Environment Scotland used infra-red technology to show how damp and water has damaged the building. A mesh structure is being constructed around the building to protect it from the weather while it is restored. Hill House appeal passes Â£1m milestone Appeal to see Hill House 'boxed' 'Giant cage' to save Mackintosh landmark A previous infra-red survey from 2003 has been combined with the new images and further surveys to allow conservationists to pinpoint the worst affected areas and understand why the property's condition is declining. This video can not be played Mackintosh house is surrounded by cage The technique highlights differences in surface temperature, which shows where moisture from decades of wet weather has accumulated within the building. The Hill House was finished in 1904, but a century of Scottish weather has taken its toll. Rennie Mackintosh had envisioned it as ""a home for the future"" and used experimental building material - which has allowed water to soak into the building. Richard Williams, of the National Trust for Scotland, said: ""These surveys reinforce what we already knew about the house, which is that it is very damp and has considerable issues that need to be overcome. The house will be protected by the temporary structure while work is carried out ""Due to the design of the Hill House, there are many ledges, wall heads and chimneys that have had a history of many attempts to remedy, yet this problem continues. ""We're also now have additional areas of concern. We have also been able to see the direction that the water is travelling in some of the rooms, in particular in the exhibition room, where there was already clear damage. ""The works to create the 'box' are now well under way and we are grateful to the many individuals who have generously donated to help us to tackle these problems. The intention is that the structure will provide a temporary respite for the Hill House pending a long-term solution to the water ingress being found."" The house and gardens are currently closed to the public but are expected to reopen in late spring.

"Passengers have complained of long queues Eurostar is again telling passengers only to travel from Paris to London ""if absolutely necessary"". Its services have been hit again by long queues caused by industrial action by French customs officers. The officers are working to rule, and only one of the usual six X-ray machines is being operated. The company, which has apologised, says tickets can be changed free of charge, or affected passengers can claim refunds. A company spokesperson said that passengers who had to travel should turn up for the train they were booked on, but that they should not worry if they didn't make it through the barriers on time, as they would be allowed on the next train departing. It added that those who arrived at their destination more than 60 minutes late could claim compensation. But Eurostar's website is again recommending,externalnot to travel unless absolutely necessary. Customs officers are demanding higher pay and better working conditions. They also want more staff, which they say will be needed after Brexit to help process British citizens who will no longer have European Union passports. The industrial action is due to last until 19 March. Brexit and holidays: What do I need to know?

"The train was travelling 50km (30 miles) from Mabopane to Pretoria South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa may have hoped that joining the morning commute would mark him out as a man of the people ahead of elections in May. That plan has either backfired or worked, depending on how you view it. He and other passengers were stuck on a train for four hours on a journey that should have taken 45 minutes. ""It is unacceptable,"" President Ramaphosa said after the train reached its destination. He said the national rail operator, Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa), had to act to improve the situation ""otherwise heads will roll"".

Angered commuters have even set trains alight, our reporter adds. The delay to the train the president caught in Gauteng province was caused by another train that had to stop after its driver was hit by a stone which had been thrown at him, a Prasa spokesman said. He also blamed ""ongoing and sustained attack on our rail infrastructure byâ¦ thugs"".

"Jeremy Hunt has been meeting other European foreign ministers A ""lot more work"" is required to get MPs to back Theresa May's Brexit deal, Jeremy Hunt has said, amid uncertainty over whether it will be put to a vote for a third time this week. The foreign secretary said there were ""encouraging signs"" that opponents of the deal were slowly coming round. But he said another vote would only be held before Thursday's EU summit if ministers were ""confident"" of victory. A number of Brexiteers have signalled they will continue to oppose the deal. Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson called for further changes to the terms of withdrawal, which the EU has rejected,while 22 Tory MPs have written to the Daily Telegraph,externalsaying that leaving without any agreement - known as a no-deal exit - on 29 March would actually be a ""good deal"" for the UK. Although the PM's plan is expected to be voted on for a third time in the coming days, the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the situation remained highly unpredictable. She said it was ""eminently feasible"" the PM would delay a vote until after Thursday's summit - at which European leaders will discuss a UK request to extend the Brexit process and delay the UK's departure. Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Brexit: A really simple guide No Brexit deal vote 'without DUP support' Last week,MPs rejected Theresa May's deal for a second time- this time by 149 votes - and then backed plans to rule out leaving the EU without a deal. They alsovoted in favour of an extension to the process- either until 30 June, if the deal is supported before 20 March; or a longer one that could include taking part in European elections if MPs reject her plan again. All 27 EU member states would have to agree to an extension. The prime minister has already had two attempts at getting her deal through Parliament The possibility of Brexit being delayed or overturned in another referendum has seen some MPs reluctantly back Mrs May's deal. A group of 15 Tory MPs from Leave-backing constituencies, including former Brexit Secretary David Davis, wrote a letter urging colleagues to back the deal to ensure Brexit goes ahead.

Speaking as he arrived in Brussels for a meeting of EU foreign ministers, Mr Hunt welcomed the fact ""strong critics"" of the deal were now prepared to support it in order to prevent the risk of ""paralysis"". ""I think there are some cautious signs of encouragement,"" he said. ""But there is a lot more work to do...That is why we will be redoubling our efforts this week."" Asked if a third vote would definitely happen before Thursday's EU summit, he said he hoped it will but ""we have to be confident we will get the numbers"". Boris Johnson and other Brexiteers say they still want changes to the agreement So far the number of Tories publicly switching positions falls far short of the 75 MPs Mrs May needs to switch sides. Andrea Jenkyns told BBC News she was a ""conviction politician...and would not be bullied into backing the deal"" while Lee Rowley told Politics Live he could not support the deal as it stood as a ""matter of principle"". Writing in his weekly Daily Telegraph column,external, Mr Johnson warned the UK would be ""humiliated"" if there was not a radical change of approach. Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button Jacob Rees-Mogg, chair of the European Research Group of Tory Brexiteers, said he was ""waiting to see"" whether the Democratic Unionists would swing round behind the deal before deciding which way to vote. But he said he still believed leaving without any agreement was the ""best option"", telling LBC ""it means... we will have restored our nation's independence"". Senior ministers have indicated the support of the DUP's 10 MPs, whose votes prop up the Conservative government, remains crucial. No 10 confirmed negotiations with the DUP were continuing, including over the question of how the Northern Ireland Assembly could block any new regulatory barriers to trade with the rest of the UK. DUP MLA Jim Wells told BBC Radio 4's Today the party still had a ""huge difficulty"" with the existing backstop arrangements - designed to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland but which opponents say will separate Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. He said: ""We could find ourselves locked in there forever in effect - and once you get in, you can never get out."" With UK politics mired in a fog of confusion, the only thing the EU can control this week is choreography at their leaders' summit. Donald Tusk, European Council President and the representative of all 27 EU countries in Brussels, is visiting a number of capitals to try to co-ordinate a single EU response if or when Mrs May asks for an extension to Article 50. On Monday, he's in Berlin and Paris - capitals of the EU superpowers, Germany and France. But when it comes to an extension, any of the EU's 27 leaders has a veto. The decision must be unanimous. This conjures up horror visions in EU leaders' minds over being held to ransom by one of their ranks keen to use this leverage over Brexit to win a concession from Brussels over a separate issue.

"This video can not be played Priority 'finding Utrecht tram gunman' A gunman has opened fire inside a tram and at several other locations in the Dutch city of Utrecht, authorities say. Several people have been injured and one is feared to have died, media reports say. Police say the gunman is still at large. Trains and trams have stopped running and schools have been asked to keep their doors closed. Counter-terrorism police reportedly say the shooting ""appears to be a terrorist attack"".

"Social media sites had ""questions to answer"" said Jacinda Ardern Facebook says it has deleted more than 1.5 million copies of the video of the mosque attacks in New Zealand in the first day after the incident. In a tweet,it said that 1.2 million of those copies,externalwere blocked while they were being uploaded. Fifty people died and dozens were injured in Friday's twin shootings. Facebook said it would also remove edited versions, to stop ""graphic content"" being shared, although copies still appear to be available online. The social network released the information as politicians and commentators called for more to be done to police live-streaming. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said that Facebook and other social media giants had ""further questions"" to answer about how they responded to the event. ""Obviously these social media platforms have wide reach,"" she said. ""This is an issue that goes well beyond New Zealand."" MPs call for tax on social media companies Javid warns tech giants over NZ footage Anger as shooter video spreads around world Spark NZ, the biggest telecoms firm in New Zealand, told Reuters that it had cut off access to ""dozens"" of websites redistributing video of the attack. Police in New Zealand said the video was now classified as an ""objectionable publication"", making it an offence to distribute or possess the material. An 18-year-old has appeared in court in New Zealand charged with allegedly distributing a live-stream of the attack. He could face up to 14 years in jail if convicted. Social media sites including Twitter andYouTube,externalhave also been chasing down and removing copies of the video uploaded by users. One report in the Washington Post suggested,externalthat clips and re-posts were being shared at a rate of one per second via YouTube. YouTube said the amount of videos connected to the tragedy in Christchurch was ""unprecedented both in scale and speed"". It added that it used technical tools and humans to prevent graphic content spreading on the site. Reddit has also banned a discussion forum on its site called ""watchpeopledie"", because clips of the Christchurch attack were being shared and because it was ""posting content that incites or glorifies violence"". It also issued a plea to users to report anyone uploading footage. The social news site said it had also taken down posts that linked to the video or which showed the attack. Valve, which runs the Steam gaming network, alsosaid it removed more than 100 ""tributes"",externalby its members that sought to memorialise the alleged shooter. Some changed their profiles to include the gunman's name or image and others used gifs of the attack in their bios. The inability of social sites to stop the video circulating was having an effect in other ways in New Zealand. Lotto NZ said it had pulled all advertising from social media sites and the country's ASB Bank said was ""considering"" a similar step. Industry groups representing advertisers issued a statement asking their members if they wanted to be ""associated"" with platforms that did not take responsibility for the content being shared. The groups said: ""The events in Christchurch raise the question, if the site owners can target consumers with advertising in microseconds, why can't the same technology be applied to prevent this kind of content being streamed live?""

"A policeman stands guard outside Al Noor mosque two days after the attacks Nasir Uddin gazes through the trees in the park towards the exterior wall and golden dome of the Al Noor mosque across the road. With a police perimeter still in place, it's as near as he can get. He looks at the building with tear-filled eyes. ""Now we are very sad,"" he says shakily as he stands in Christchurch's Hagley Park. A migrant from Bangladesh, Mr Uddin, 37, moved to this picturesque city on the east coast of New Zealand's South Island more than five years ago. An Al Noor regular, he would have been at the mosque on Friday if he hadn't had to work. The peace of Christchurch's largest mosque was shattered that day by a gunman who burst in and opened fire with semi-automatic weapons just after worshippers had gathered for congregational prayer. The shocking act of violence here and at another mosque in the city that left 50 people dead has caused outrage across the world, not least because the perpetrator live-streamed his murderous assault on Al Noor on Facebook via a head-mounted camera. Nasir Uddin: ""Now we are very sad"" The Al Noor mosque has always been ""very precious to us"", says Anjum Rahman of the Islamic Women's Council of New Zealand. ""When it was built, it was the southernmost mosque in the world."" Founded by the local Muslim community, Al Noor is notable for having brought together worshippers from highly diverse backgrounds across the Muslim world, among them refugees. Some of the known victims includea tech entrepreneur who was also a futsal star, and an elderly Afghan man who had escaped the Soviet invasion in the 1980s. They had all found a home in New Zealand. Victims from both shootings are believed to include people who had begun their lives in nations including Jordan, Egypt, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia, the United Arab Emirates, Afghanistan, Syria, Kuwait and India. Who were the victims? How the attacks unfolded Social media's role in attack For Ms Rahman, whose family has been in New Zealand since 1972, the diversity of the nation's mosques such as Al Noor shows how the local Muslim community had come ""to welcome everyone"". She says: ""I think New Zealand is probably the best example in the world where we have done that successfully. It didn't happen by accident. It's something that we worked on and our parents' generation worked on."" At Hagley Park, two joggers pause beneath a tree to observe a tiny collection of flowers and tributes. One becomes visibly emotional, her lip trembling as she is comforted by her companion. Seconds later, they are jogging again. For Eleanor Morgan, 53, it's a horrifying contrast to her usual experience of the Hagley Park area, a place that for her is the heart of Christchurch. ""It should have been their haven, their safe place,"" she says. ""We hope we find we can show some way to show our love."" Another visitor, Jawakar Selvaraj, 25, was in the park about 15 minutes before the shooting. Originally from India, he says he has felt frightened ever since Friday's events. ""I'm sure nothing will happen but there's a tinge of fear for an immigrant,"" he says. On the other side of the park, hundreds of people visit a larger collection of flowers and tributes. Many messages have been left there. ""We breathe the same air. We walk the same land. We bleed the same blood."" ""This is your home. And you should have been safe here."" ""Our hearts are with you, your family, your friends & your community. We feel your pain. We cry your tears."" ""Hug your loved ones close."" Another tribute is simply painted with the name ""Sayyad"", a reference to Sayyad Milne, a 14-year-old boy who was at the Al Noor mosque and isbelieved to be among the dead,external. Fridays at the Al Noor mosque were a time for people to come together, Mr Uddin says. ""Then we can meet our friends,"" he says. ""We can see our friends. Everything is fine here."" After hearing of the attacks, he began frantically calling people, but no-one answered. He knows at least two of his friends are dead, and is waiting for news on others.

"The star continued to play live up until his death Surf guitar pioneer Dick Dale, whose song Misirlou played over the opening credits to Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction, has died aged 81. Dale was known for his blindingly fast strumming style, which inspired acts like The Beach Boys and Jimi Hendrix. He said the sound reminded him of the rumble and crash of the waves, and the noises of marine animals as he surfed in California. Dale's bassist Sam Bolle confirmed the star had died on Saturday night. The cause of death is not yet known, but the guitarist had a long history of ill health, including renal failure, diabetes and cancer. Dale's agent called his death ""a sad day for rock 'n' roll"". Dick Dale and the Del-Tones pioneered the surf rock sound in the early 1960s Celebrities and fans have been paying tribute to the musician referred to as the ""King of the Surf Guitar"" and the ""Pied Piper of Balboa Beach"", with many describing him as a ""true innovator"". And recording industry body the BPI said it saluted ""a great musician who created a brilliant and uniquely distinctive style and sound that will forever be his hallmark"". David Simon, creator of The Wire, observed: ""If you ever bought an electric guitar and imagined playing it like Dick Dale, you were on a certain path to eventually recognising your own idiocy. ""You might learn some stuff, play some stuff. But you were not going to play like Dick Dale. Just no."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Dale was born Richard Anthony Monsour in Boston, Massachusetts in 1937 to a father who had emigrated from Lebanon and a mother who was Polish Belarusian. His instrumental music was influenced by his heritage - using Middle Eastern and Eastern European melodies as well as ""exotic"" scales that weren't common to rock music. As a young boy, he tried to learn the trumpet and the ukulele, thinking he might follow in the footsteps of country singer Hank Williams. But he then bought a guitar for $8 from a friend. When he was 17, his family moved to southern California, when his father found work in the aerospace industry and Dale became a keen surfer. The popularity of surf music declined after the ""British invasion"" of The Beatles and the Rolling Stones That was where he developed his percussive style of playing, initially on a right-handed guitar, despite being left-handed - essentially meaning he was playing back-to-front and upside down. His percussive approach to plucking the strings meant he often wore guitar picks down to a stub in the course of a single song - but the sound was an instinctive reaction to his love of the sea. ""When I got that feeling from surfing,"" he told the writer Barney Hoskyns, ""the white water coming over my head was the high notes going dikidikidiki, and then the dungundungun on the bottom was the waves, and I started double-picking faster and faster, like a locomotive, to feel the power of the waves."" His intense live shows regularly drew crowds of thousands to the Rendezvous Ballroom on California's Balboa Peninsula; and in September 1961, Dale released Let's Go Trippin' on the Del-Tone label, which his father founded and financed. Widely considered to be the first surf-rock song committed to tape, it was a huge local hit, and led to Dale's first album, Surfer's Choice. Allow YouTube content?

The album also included his version of Misirlou - a Greek folk song - which Dale got to perform on the Ed Sullivan Show. More than three decades later, Tarantino made the song famous again when he used it at the very start of Pulp Fiction. The Black Eyed Peas later sampled it on their 2006 hit Pump It, which reached number three on the UK charts. Dale went on to sign to Capitol Records and surf rock became a major fad, inspiring acts including The Beach Boys, The Trashmen, Jan and Dean and The Surfaris. The star's pyrotechnic guitar technique also influenced the likes of Jimi Hendrix, Jimmy Page, The B-52s and Stevie Ray Vaughan. But he retired from music in 1966 after being diagnosed with rectal cancer. After beating the disease, he pursued dozens of other interests from caring for endangered animals to obtaining a pilot's licence. After picking up a pollution-related infection while surfing in 1979, he also became an environmental campaigner. An early photo of Dick Dale alongside a custom Fender guitar at an exhibit in California He returned to music in the 1980s, and continued to tour until his death, against the advice of his doctors. ""They say I should never be on stage, I shouldn't be playing,""he told Vice News in 2012,external, adding: ""My medical bill is over $3,000 a month to buy supplies I have to get for my body."" He also praised his wife, Lana, in the interview as ""the one who brought me back"". Dale is survived by Lana and his son, Jimmie. Allow Twitter content?

"A group of MPs is calling for a tax on social media companies' profits, saying the firms are operating in ""an online wild west"". Its report, which follows a year-long inquiry into the health impact of social media, says the industry should do more to protect children and young people online. The government is due to publish its own proposals within weeks. It says all kinds of steps are being explored to increase online safety. The All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Social Media and Young People's Mental Health and Wellbeing invited experts, charities, parents and young people to give evidence to its inquiry. It found that although social media had many positive effects, such as acting as a supportive community and a place of learning, it could also expose young people to cyber-bullying, self-harm and feelings of low self-esteem. The report,externalacknowledged there was still a lack of robust scientific evidence that social media actually causes mental health problems in young people, but it said precautionary measures should be taken to minimise any potential harm. Last month,the UK's chief medical officers issued guidanceon screen time, saying children should take a break from screen-based activities every two hours and phones should be kept out of bedrooms at bedtime. How can governments regulate social media? Social media companies 'failing children' Instagram 'helped kill my daughter' Can you talk about self-harm online safely? UK 'could ban' social media over suicide images The report's main recommendations include: â¢  creating a Social Media Health Alliance, funded by a 0.5% tax on the profits of social media companies, to fund research and draw up clearer guidance for the public â¢  establishing a duty of care on all social media companies with registered UK users aged 24 and under â¢  reviewing whether the ""addictive"" nature of social media is sufficient to classify it as an official disease â¢  commissioning robust research into understanding how social media affects young people's mental health The report, written with the Royal Society for Public Health, says companies like Facebook, Instagram and YouTube were starting to address health harms, but there was still room for improvement. Chris Elmore MP, chair of the APPG on Social Media and Young People's Mental Health and Wellbeing said the report was a wake-up call for meaningful action. ""For far too long social media companies have been allowed to operate in an online 'wild west'. ""And it is in this lawless landscape that our children currently work and play online. This cannot continue. As the report makes clear, now is the time for the government to take action."" Shirley Cramer CBE, chief executive of RSPH, said the priority was regulation, and a duty of care to protect vulnerable users in a ""lawless digital playground"". She also said she wanted to see industry supporting further research to improve our understanding of the health harms, as well as the benefits, from social media. ""We hope that our findings are recognised and included in the forthcoming White Paper from the Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport so that we can empower our young people to manage their relationship with social media in a way that protects and promotes their mental health and wellbeing,"" Ms Cramer said. A government spokeswoman said: ""The government will soon publish a White Paper which will set out the responsibilities of online platforms, how these responsibilities should be met and what would happen if they are not.

"A group of MPs is calling for a tax on social media companies' profits, saying the firms are operating in ""an online wild west"". Its report, which follows a year-long inquiry into the health impact of social media, says the industry should do more to protect children and young people online. The government is due to publish its own proposals within weeks. It says all kinds of steps are being explored to increase online safety. The All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Social Media and Young People's Mental Health and Wellbeing invited experts, charities, parents and young people to give evidence to its inquiry. It found that although social media had many positive effects, such as acting as a supportive community and a place of learning, it could also expose young people to cyber-bullying, self-harm and feelings of low self-esteem. The report,externalacknowledged there was still a lack of robust scientific evidence that social media actually causes mental health problems in young people, but it said precautionary measures should be taken to minimise any potential harm. Last month,the UK's chief medical officers issued guidanceon screen time, saying children should take a break from screen-based activities every two hours and phones should be kept out of bedrooms at bedtime. How can governments regulate social media? Social media companies 'failing children' Instagram 'helped kill my daughter' Can you talk about self-harm online safely? UK 'could ban' social media over suicide images The report's main recommendations include: â¢  creating a Social Media Health Alliance, funded by a 0.5% tax on the profits of social media companies, to fund research and draw up clearer guidance for the public â¢  establishing a duty of care on all social media companies with registered UK users aged 24 and under â¢  reviewing whether the ""addictive"" nature of social media is sufficient to classify it as an official disease â¢  commissioning robust research into understanding how social media affects young people's mental health The report, written with the Royal Society for Public Health, says companies like Facebook, Instagram and YouTube were starting to address health harms, but there was still room for improvement. Chris Elmore MP, chair of the APPG on Social Media and Young People's Mental Health and Wellbeing said the report was a wake-up call for meaningful action. ""For far too long social media companies have been allowed to operate in an online 'wild west'. ""And it is in this lawless landscape that our children currently work and play online. This cannot continue. As the report makes clear, now is the time for the government to take action."" Shirley Cramer CBE, chief executive of RSPH, said the priority was regulation, and a duty of care to protect vulnerable users in a ""lawless digital playground"". She also said she wanted to see industry supporting further research to improve our understanding of the health harms, as well as the benefits, from social media. ""We hope that our findings are recognised and included in the forthcoming White Paper from the Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport so that we can empower our young people to manage their relationship with social media in a way that protects and promotes their mental health and wellbeing,"" Ms Cramer said. A government spokeswoman said: ""The government will soon publish a White Paper which will set out the responsibilities of online platforms, how these responsibilities should be met and what would happen if they are not. ""An internet regulator, statutory 'duty of care' on platforms, and a levy on social media companies are all measures we are considering as part of our work.""

"Cate Blanchett starred in a revival of Sir David's Plenty in 1999 Women are seeing better representation in film and theatre, Sir David Hare has said, but the change is due to societal pressure rather than the industry. The acclaimed playwright and director said there were more stories being told about women but the number of women behind the camera was ""still tiny"". The industry was ""running along behind"" society, he said. Sir David, known for creating leading roles for women, wrote screenplays for The Hours, The Reader and Collateral. ""I've been going on about women's lives and about the importance of portraying women's lives for 45 years now and nobody listened for the first 45 years,"" he said. ""And at last, people are listening. ""Now I don't think that's a change in the industry, I think that's a change in society."" Sir David wrote the screenplay for The Hours starring Julianne Moore, Meryl Streep and Nicole Kidman, pictured left to right at the 2002 film premiere The US campaign group, Time's Up, says only 4% of Hollywood's biggest earning films from the past decade were directed by women. Speaking in February, British director Georgia Parris said it was a ""pretty depressing figure"" and part of the ""age-old problem that women are hired on experience and men are hired on potential"". A movement, known as the #4percentchallenge, is now trying to inspire confidence in future movie-makers and Time's Up is asking actors to commit to working with a female director in the next 12 months. Women in film: 'We're living in the dark ages' Female film casting same as 100 years ago In the UK, the percentage of women being cast in UK films (around 25%) has barely changed in more than 100 years, data released by the British Film Institute (BFI) in 2017 showed. However, the percentage of female crew members went up from 3% to 33% over the same period of time. But in very recent times, women's involvement in film-making appears to be increasing, according toBFI data.,external In 2017, 21% of screenwriters of UK films were women, up from 16% the previous year. Among directors there was an upward trend too - from 13% in 2016 to 16% in 2017. And at the 2018 BFI Film Festival, a major London event, 38% of the films screened were directed by women. Ahead of the release of his new film, The White Crow, Sir David said: ""I think there is undoubtedly a change in the theatre and in the cinema. ""I don't, I'm afraid, believe that it's come from within the cinema and the theatre. ""I believe it's come from outwith, it's come from the pressure of change in society itself. ""And the way you know that is, yes, there are more stories about women, but the number of women behind the camera is still tiny."" The White Crow, written by Sir David and directed by Ralph Fiennes, is about the Russian ballet star Rudolf Nureyev's defection to the West in 1961. It will be in cinemas from Friday.

"Social media sites had ""questions to answer"" said Jacinda Ardern Facebook says it has deleted more than 1.5 million copies of the video of the mosque attacks in New Zealand in the first day after the incident. In a tweet,it said that 1.2 million of those copies,externalwere blocked while they were being uploaded. Fifty people died and dozens were injured in Friday's twin shootings. Facebook said it would also remove edited versions, to stop ""graphic content"" being shared, although copies still appear to be available online. The social network released the information as politicians and commentators called for more to be done to police live-streaming. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said that Facebook and other social media giants had ""further questions"" to answer about how they responded to the event. ""Obviously these social media platforms have wide reach,"" she said. ""This is an issue that goes well beyond New Zealand."" MPs call for tax on social media companies Javid warns tech giants over NZ footage Anger as shooter video spreads around world Spark NZ, the biggest telecoms firm in New Zealand, told Reuters that it had cut off access to ""dozens"" of websites redistributing video of the attack. Police in New Zealand said the video was now classified as an ""objectionable publication"", making it an offence to distribute or possess the material. An 18-year-old has appeared in court in New Zealand charged with allegedly distributing a live-stream of the attack. He could face up to 14 years in jail if convicted. Social media sites including Twitter andYouTube,externalhave also been chasing down and removing copies of the video uploaded by users. One report in the Washington Post suggested,externalthat clips and re-posts were being shared at a rate of one per second via YouTube. YouTube said the amount of videos connected to the tragedy in Christchurch was ""unprecedented both in scale and speed"". It added that it used technical tools and humans to prevent graphic content spreading on the site. Reddit has also banned a discussion forum on its site called ""watchpeopledie"", because clips of the Christchurch attack were being shared and because it was ""posting content that incites or glorifies violence"". It also issued a plea to users to report anyone uploading footage. The social news site said it had also taken down posts that linked to the video or which showed the attack. Valve, which runs the Steam gaming network, alsosaid it removed more than 100 ""tributes"",externalby its members that sought to memorialise the alleged shooter. Some changed their profiles to include the gunman's name or image and others used gifs of the attack in their bios. The inability of social sites to stop the video circulating was having an effect in other ways in New Zealand. Lotto NZ said it had pulled all advertising from social media sites and the country's ASB Bank said was ""considering"" a similar step. Industry groups representing advertisers issued a statement asking their members if they wanted to be ""associated"" with platforms that did not take responsibility for the content being shared. The groups said: ""The events in Christchurch raise the question, if the site owners can target consumers with advertising in microseconds, why can't the same technology be applied to prevent this kind of content being streamed live?""

"This video can not be played The New Zealand church-goers rallying to help mosque attack victims Stories of heroism have emerged from Friday's attacks at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, in which 50 people died and dozens were wounded. A worshipper says he confronted the gunman and threw a credit card reader at him. Two police officers, one of them armed with only a handgun, chased and arrested Brenton Tarrant, 28. The suspect had explosives in his car and was planning more attacks that day, said Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern. She has called the killings ""an act of terror"". Later on Monday, her cabinet is to discuss changing the country's gun laws. Who are the victims? How attacks unfolded More about the suspect Investigators have been examining the bodies, which are due be returned to relatives for burial by Wednesday. Tributes have been paid for the victims while some 34 people remain in hospital, including a four-year-old girl who is in a critical condition. Abdul Aziz says he chased the gunman with a credit card machine Afghan-born Abdul Aziz, 48, said he was inside the Linwood mosque, the second target of the attacker, when he heard shouts that someone had opened fire. When he realised the mosque was being attacked, he picked up a credit card machine and ran towards the attacker. He threw the device at the gunman when he returned to his car to pick up another weapon, and ducked between cars as the gunman opened fire on him. Mr Aziz, who was in the mosque with four of his children, picked up a gun that the suspect had dropped and pulled the trigger, but it was empty. He followed the attacker back inside the mosque, where he eventually confronted him again. ""When he saw me with the shotgun, he dropped the gun and ran away toward his car. I chased him,"" he told Reuters news agency. ""He sat in his car and... I threw [the gun] through his window like an arrow. He just swore at me and took off."" This video can not be played Victim's husband Farid Uddin: ""I have forgiven him and I will pray for him"" Linwood's acting imam Latef Alabi told the Associated Pressthe death toll would have been far higher,externalat the mosque if Mr Aziz, who said he had not feared the gunman, had not acted. Two rural community police officers who were nearby chased the attacker, blocked his car and captured him. The moment was filmed by a witness, who posted the footage on social media. ""[The officers] put New Zealand first,"" Ms Ardern said on Saturday, adding that they would be recognised for their bravery. By Jay Savage in Christchurch Nasir Uddin gazes through the trees in the park towards the exterior wall and golden roof of the Al Noor mosque across the road. With a police perimeter still in place, it's as near as he can get. He looks at the building with tear-filled eyes. ""Now we are very sad,"" he says shakily as he stands in Christchurch's Hagley Park. A migrant from Bangladesh, Mr Uddin, 37, moved to this picturesque city on the east coast of New Zealand's South Island more than five years ago. An Al Noor regular, he would have been at the mosque on Friday if he hadn't had to work. After hearing of the attacks, he began frantically calling people, but no-one answered. He knows at least two of his friends are dead, and is waiting for news on others. ""This thing that we feel is too painful."" Read more from Jay The gunman first attacked the Al Noor mosque, about 5km (three miles) away, as people had gathered for Friday prayers. The self-described white supremacist live-streamed it on Facebook. The video showed 50-year-old Naeem Rashid, originally from the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, apparently trying to tackle the gunman before being shot. He was taken to hospital but later died. This video can not be played Victim's brother: ""No words to describe the pain"" ""There were a few witnesses who said he saved a few lives by trying to stop that guy,"" his brother Khurshid Alam told the BBC. ""It's our pride now, but still the loss. It's like cutting your limb off."" Mr Rashid's 21-year-old son Talha - who had just got a new job and was said to be hoping to get married soon - was also killed. The family had been living in New Zealand since 2010. Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan said Mr Rashid would be honoured posthumously. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Farid Uddin said his wife had helped several women and children escape from the building as the attack unfolded. ""We feel proud of what she did. She died in a good cause. She did exactly what she loved and what I loved,"" he told the BBC. ""I lost my wife but I don't hate the killer. As a person I love him,"" he added. ""I forgive him... I pray for him."" Social media's role in attack New Zealand's gun laws Police arrived at the mosque - where at least 41 people were killed - six minutes after an emergency call, Police Commissioner Mike Bush said, and the gunman was in custody within 36 minutes. On Tuesday, Parliament will pay a tribute to the victims. Other confirmed victims include: Kuwait-born Atta Elayyan, 33, who was the goalkeeper for New Zealand's futsal team Khaled Mustafa, a refugee from the war in Syria Sayyad Milne, a 14-year-old who wanted to be a footballer when he grew up Brenton Tarrant appeared in court on Saturday in a white prison shirt and handcuffs, smiling for the cameras. He has been charged with one count of murder, with more charges expected to follow. He is the only person charged with carrying out the shootings and is believed to have acted alone, according to Commissioner Bush.

"Paedophile Jordan Yardley was caught after sending indecent sexual messages to an online ""decoy"" A new campaign will directly address sex predators who target children online as it emerged police detected nearly 1,600 crimes in just 11 months. The figures were revealed ahead of #StopItNow which asks offenders how their family, employers and the wider public would view their actions online. Almost 70% of crimes between April last year and February were detected and resulted in arrests. The four-week initiative will feature adverts across social media channels. Police Scotland's Assistant Chief Constable Gillian MacDonald said: ""Perpetrators of online child abuse are single minded and target children using messaging apps. ""This includes crimes of grooming children for sexual purposes, indecently communicating with children and causing children to participate in sexual activity."" She said offenders were predominately men but came from all age groups and walks of life. Jordan Yardley was confronted by members of a paedophile vigilante group Paedophile Jordan Yardley was caught after sending indecent sexual messages to a decoy who was pretending to be an under-age schoolgirl. The 22-year-old, from Livingston, West Lothian, was already a registered sex offender when he started grooming a person he thought was a 12-year-old girl on social media. In reality, his Facebook ""friend"" was a member of the paedophile vigilante group Wolf Pack Hunters. Yardley said he would show her how to kiss and ""teach her about sex"" when she turned 13. He arranged to meet the youngster for sex but instead was confronted by members of the group who streamed the encounter live on the internet. When he was quizzed on camera about his motives, Yardley confessed that being a paedophile ""didn't bother him"". He was sentenced to 27 months in prison at Livingston Sheriff Court. He will also be subject to 12 months' post-release supervision. ACC MacDonald added: ""Their motivations vary. Some may not see children as victims, they may not see themselves as abusers. ""Most don't believe they will get caught."" The hard-hitting campaign will invite offenders to consider the impact of their actions on their loved ones Forensic investigators use a range of tools and techniques to identify perpetrators. The senior officer warned: ""As our figures show, the vast majority of those who engage with children for sexual purposes, who groom or attempt to groom will be caught. ""They will face the consequences of their actions, their families will find out and they will face public exposure. ""Our message to offenders or people who think they might offend is get help. ""What you are doing is wrong, you will be caught and you risk losing everything."" Police Scotland has joined forces with Stop It Now! Scotland for the Â£30,000 campaign. Stuart Allardyce, the organisation's national manager, said the crime ruined lives. He said: ""There are no grey areas whether it is sexual conversations with young people online, an attempt to solicit sexual images from them or trying to meet up - all of these things are illegal. ""Our work with men who have committed online offences tells us that many knew what they were doing was wrong - but that they didn't know how to stop. ""Our message is clear - get help."" Sex offenders use social media sites to target children and strike up a relationship with them Mr Allardyce said those close to offenders also suffered. He added: ""The long-lasting hurt caused to the families of offenders is often underestimated. ""We often work with wives and children of offenders who are devastated by the actions of their loved one."" Stop It Now! offers confidential and anonymous help and advice to those who want to change their behaviour. New police figures reveal that 98 of the 1583 offences so far in 2018/19 involved reports of grooming or attempting to groom children for sexual purposes. Of that number 86 (90%) were detected. The total number of offences is significantly up on 2017/18 (1,391) and 2016/17 (1,395). Grooming figures for 2018/19 have also increased compared with 2017/18 (69) and are more than double the total for 2016/17 (46). Stop it Now!

"The star continued to play live up until his death Surf guitar pioneer Dick Dale, whose song Misirlou played over the opening credits to Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction, has died aged 81. Dale was known for his blindingly fast strumming style, which inspired acts like The Beach Boys and Jimi Hendrix. He said the sound reminded him of the rumble and crash of the waves, and the noises of marine animals as he surfed in California. Dale's bassist Sam Bolle confirmed the star had died on Saturday night. The cause of death is not yet known, but the guitarist had a long history of ill health, including renal failure, diabetes and cancer. Dale's agent called his death ""a sad day for rock 'n' roll"". Dick Dale and the Del-Tones pioneered the surf rock sound in the early 1960s Celebrities and fans have been paying tribute to the musician referred to as the ""King of the Surf Guitar"" and the ""Pied Piper of Balboa Beach"", with many describing him as a ""true innovator"". And recording industry body the BPI said it saluted ""a great musician who created a brilliant and uniquely distinctive style and sound that will forever be his hallmark"". David Simon, creator of The Wire, observed: ""If you ever bought an electric guitar and imagined playing it like Dick Dale, you were on a certain path to eventually recognising your own idiocy. ""You might learn some stuff, play some stuff. But you were not going to play like Dick Dale. Just no."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Dale was born Richard Anthony Monsour in Boston, Massachusetts in 1937 to a father who had emigrated from Lebanon and a mother who was Polish Belarusian. His instrumental music was influenced by his heritage - using Middle Eastern and Eastern European melodies as well as ""exotic"" scales that weren't common to rock music. As a young boy, he tried to learn the trumpet and the ukulele, thinking he might follow in the footsteps of country singer Hank Williams. But he then bought a guitar for $8 from a friend. When he was 17, his family moved to southern California, when his father found work in the aerospace industry and Dale became a keen surfer. The popularity of surf music declined after the ""British invasion"" of The Beatles and the Rolling Stones That was where he developed his percussive style of playing, initially on a right-handed guitar, despite being left-handed - essentially meaning he was playing back-to-front and upside down. His percussive approach to plucking the strings meant he often wore guitar picks down to a stub in the course of a single song - but the sound was an instinctive reaction to his love of the sea. ""When I got that feeling from surfing,"" he told the writer Barney Hoskyns, ""the white water coming over my head was the high notes going dikidikidiki, and then the dungundungun on the bottom was the waves, and I started double-picking faster and faster, like a locomotive, to feel the power of the waves."" His intense live shows regularly drew crowds of thousands to the Rendezvous Ballroom on California's Balboa Peninsula; and in September 1961, Dale released Let's Go Trippin' on the Del-Tone label, which his father founded and financed. Widely considered to be the first surf-rock song committed to tape, it was a huge local hit, and led to Dale's first album, Surfer's Choice. Allow YouTube content?

The album also included his version of Misirlou - a Greek folk song - which Dale got to perform on the Ed Sullivan Show. More than three decades later, Tarantino made the song famous again when he used it at the very start of Pulp Fiction. The Black Eyed Peas later sampled it on their 2006 hit Pump It, which reached number three on the UK charts. Dale went on to sign to Capitol Records and surf rock became a major fad, inspiring acts including The Beach Boys, The Trashmen, Jan and Dean and The Surfaris. The star's pyrotechnic guitar technique also influenced the likes of Jimi Hendrix, Jimmy Page, The B-52s and Stevie Ray Vaughan. But he retired from music in 1966 after being diagnosed with rectal cancer. After beating the disease, he pursued dozens of other interests from caring for endangered animals to obtaining a pilot's licence. After picking up a pollution-related infection while surfing in 1979, he also became an environmental campaigner. An early photo of Dick Dale alongside a custom Fender guitar at an exhibit in California He returned to music in the 1980s, and continued to tour until his death, against the advice of his doctors. ""They say I should never be on stage, I shouldn't be playing,""he told Vice News in 2012,external, adding: ""My medical bill is over $3,000 a month to buy supplies I have to get for my body."" He also praised his wife, Lana, in the interview as ""the one who brought me back"". Dale is survived by Lana and his son, Jimmie. Allow Twitter content?

"A payment processing firm that used to be owned by Royal Bank of Scotland has been sold in a deal worth $43bn (Â£32bn). WorldPay has been bought by Florida-based Fidelity National Information Services (FIS) for $35bn in cash and shares, plus WorldPay's debt. Customers of WorldPay include TopShop, Clarks, Monsoon, Accessorize and multiple pub and restaurant chains. FIS sells payment services and also software for the finance industry. WorldPay was sold by RBS in 2010 as a condition of the bank's bailout following the financial crisis. Since then WorldPay's value has risen dramatically and now matches the stock market value of its former owner RBS. Demand for WorldPay services has surged as shoppers are using their cards more, either to buy products online, or using cards in shops. FIS said buying WorldPay would help it sell more services to banks and other financial firms. The company's chief executive Gary Norcross said ""scale matters in our rapidly changing industry"". The rise of financial technology firms, known as fintech, has seen technology firms taking on banks in a race for control of the digital payments market. ""The need to invest, to continue to modernise both the technology and application layers, and continue to innovate so our customers can continue to be disrupters, will be important for us,"" Mr Norcross told investors in a call on Monday. Neil Wilson, from Markets.com, said the deal ""signifies the very rapid shift in the payments industry and the amount of investment the businesses need"". He expects more deals in the sector as companies look to get bigger. Gareth Wilson, Accenture's global payments chief, said the deal was ""huge"" for the industry, in particular because it ""puts a price on the expected value of disruption"" in the industry. ""The structure of the industry is ripe for change, and payments is the battleground for new activity,"" he said. According to Accenture, in 2017 in Europe, 20% of all 1,400 financial services firms were considered to be ""new"", because they had started after 2005. The UK has seen a ""huge rise"" in fintech, because it has led the way in liberalising the banking industry. There are now 2.5 times more financial services companies in Britain than in 2005, and 91% of these firms are offering payments services. WorldPay first started in 1989 as electronic payments system Streamline. It was owned by NatWest Bank, which was then acquired by RBS in 2002. WorldPay first started as Streamline in the UK in 1989 Streamline was renamed as RBS WorldPay. RBS expanded the service to other countries, including the US and the Netherlands. In 2009 the European Commission said that RBS would have to sell WorldPay and other businesses, as a condition of approving state aid to the bank. The next year, WorldPay was sold to private equity firms Advent International and Bain Capital for Â£2bn, with RBS retaining a 20% stake. In 2013, RBS sold off its remaining stake. WorldPay went on to sell shares on the London Stock Exchange in 2015. In January 2018, US payments processing technology firm Vantiv acquired WorldPay for $10.4bn. Vantiv renamed the combined firms WorldPay. Last October, BT poached WorldPay's co-headPhilip Jansen to replace Gavin Patterson as chief executive of the telecoms group.

"Budget hotel chain Travelodge is targeting parents who want to return to work to fill a potential post-Brexit staffing gap if EU worker numbers fall. It plans to open 100 new hotels creating 3,000 jobs by 2023, and says it hopes to attract parents by offering flexible hours and school hour roles. The firm, which in 2012 was on the brink of administration, reported strong sales and profits for last year. Travelodge said sales rose 8.8% to Â£693.3m in 2018. Staff from the EUmake up nearly a quarter of all jobs in the hospitality sector. But there are concerns that proposed regulations could dictate what type of workers are allowed to come to the UK after Brexit. The government is consulting on a minimum salary requirement of Â£30,000 for foreign workers seeking five-year visas. Chief executive Peter Gowers said he remained cautious on the short-term outlook for the firm, with trading for the first eight weeks of the year ""mixed"". He said strong growth in London was being offset by declining sales in the rest of the UK. ""These are uncertain times and we are not immune from the short-term challenges, but beyond, we remain confident that there are more opportunities ahead,"" he said. The chainwent through a painful restructuring in 2012, with two US hedge funds and Goldman Sachs taking control of the company. The investors agreed to take on the firm's debt mountain in exchange for controlling stakes in the firm. Since then, sales have risen over Â£250m and earnings more than trebled. Mr Gowers said innovations such as the chain's more upmarket ""super rooms"" - which come equipped with coffee machines and high-end showers - had helped boost customer numbers. ""We've invested in better quality and choice for our guests, while staying true to our budget roots,"" he said.

"Artwork: The fireball was the kind of event expected to happen only two to three times per century A huge fireball exploded in the Earth's atmosphere in December, according to Nasa. The blast was thesecond largest of its kind in 30 years,external, and the biggest since the fireball over Chelyabinsk in Russia six years ago. But it went largely unnoticed until now because it blew up over the Bering Sea, off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula. The space rock exploded with 10 times the energy released by the Hiroshima atomic bomb. Lindley Johnson, planetary defence officer at Nasa, told BBC News a fireball this big is only expected about two or three times every 100 years. Allow Twitter content?

At about noon local time on 18 December, the asteroid barrelled through the atmosphere at a speed of 32km/s (20 miles per second) , on a steep trajectory of seven degrees. Measuring several metres in size, the space rock exploded 25.6km above the Earth's surface, with an impact energy of 173 kilotons. ""That was 40% the energy release of Chelyabinsk, but it was over the Bering Sea so it didn't have the same type of effect or show up in the news,"" said Kelly Fast, near-Earth objects observations programme manager at Nasa. ""That's another thing we have in our defence, there's plenty of water on the planet."" Dr Fast was discussing the event here at the50th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in The Woodlands, near Houston, Texas.,external What could end the world as we know it? Asteroid impact risks 'underplayed' Military satellites picked up the blast last year; Nasa was notified of the event by the US Air Force. Dr Johnson said the fireball came in over an area not too far from routes used by commercial planes flying between North America and Asia. So researchers have been checking with airlines to see if there were any reported sightings of the event. In 2005, Congress tasked Nasa with finding 90% of near-Earth asteroids of 140m (460ft) in size or larger by 2020. Space rocks of this size are so-called ""problems without passports"" because they are expected to affect whole regions if they collide with Earth. But scientists estimate it will take them another 30 years to fulfil this congressional directive.

The meteor trail was seen by Nasa's Terra satellite Once an incoming object is identified, Nasa has had some notable success at calculating where on Earth the impact will occur, based on a precise determination of its orbit. In June 2018, the small 3m (10ft) asteroid 2018 LA was discovered by a ground-based observatory in Arizona eight hours before impact. The Center for Near-Earth Object Studies at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) then made a precision determination of its orbit, which was used to calculate a probable impact location. This showed the rock was likely to hit southern Africa. Just as the calculation suggested, a fireball was recorded over Botswana by security camera footage on a farm. Fragments of the object were later found in the area. Japan's Himawari satellite captures the fireball's steep descent This video can not be played Eyewitnesses and CCTV cameras captured the moment the Chelyabinsk meteor flew across the sky The latest event over the Bering Sea shows that larger objects can collide with us without warning, underlining the need for enhanced monitoring. A more robust network would be dependent not only on ground telescopes, but space-based observatories also. A mission concept in development would see a telescope called NeoCam launched to a gravitational balance point in space, where it would discover and characterise potentially hazardous asteroids larger than 140m. Dr Amy Mainzer, chief scientist on NeoCam at JPL, said: ""The idea is really to get as close as possible to reaching that 90% goal of finding the 140m and larger near-Earth asteroids given to Nasa by Congress. She said that if the mission did not launch, projections suggested it would ""take us many decades to get there with the existing suite of ground-based surveys"". Dr Mainzer added: ""But if you have an IR-based (infrared) telescope, it goes a lot faster.""

"Cate Blanchett starred in a revival of Sir David's Plenty in 1999 Women are seeing better representation in film and theatre, Sir David Hare has said, but the change is due to societal pressure rather than the industry. The acclaimed playwright and director said there were more stories being told about women but the number of women behind the camera was ""still tiny"". The industry was ""running along behind"" society, he said. Sir David, known for creating leading roles for women, wrote screenplays for The Hours, The Reader and Collateral. ""I've been going on about women's lives and about the importance of portraying women's lives for 45 years now and nobody listened for the first 45 years,"" he said. ""And at last, people are listening. ""Now I don't think that's a change in the industry, I think that's a change in society."" Sir David wrote the screenplay for The Hours starring Julianne Moore, Meryl Streep and Nicole Kidman, pictured left to right at the 2002 film premiere The US campaign group, Time's Up, says only 4% of Hollywood's biggest earning films from the past decade were directed by women. Speaking in February, British director Georgia Parris said it was a ""pretty depressing figure"" and part of the ""age-old problem that women are hired on experience and men are hired on potential"". A movement, known as the #4percentchallenge, is now trying to inspire confidence in future movie-makers and Time's Up is asking actors to commit to working with a female director in the next 12 months. Women in film: 'We're living in the dark ages' Female film casting same as 100 years ago In the UK, the percentage of women being cast in UK films (around 25%) has barely changed in more than 100 years, data released by the British Film Institute (BFI) in 2017 showed. However, the percentage of female crew members went up from 3% to 33% over the same period of time. But in very recent times, women's involvement in film-making appears to be increasing, according toBFI data.,external In 2017, 21% of screenwriters of UK films were women, up from 16% the previous year. Among directors there was an upward trend too - from 13% in 2016 to 16% in 2017. And at the 2018 BFI Film Festival, a major London event, 38% of the films screened were directed by women. Ahead of the release of his new film, The White Crow, Sir David said: ""I think there is undoubtedly a change in the theatre and in the cinema. ""I don't, I'm afraid, believe that it's come from within the cinema and the theatre. ""I believe it's come from outwith, it's come from the pressure of change in society itself.

"A report said Wales' manufacturing sector would be hit by the plans A proposed post-Brexit salary threshold for migrants would hit Wales harder than the rest of the UK, a leading economist has warned. Prof Jonathan Portes said the possible hit to the manufacturing sector was ""of particular concern"". A UK government consultation includesa minimum Â£30,000 salary for skilled migrantsseeking five-year visas. The Home Office said it would allow the UK to attract talented workers and deliver on the referendum result. One boss in mid Wales said his company employs 30% of its staff from EU countries, adding that there are not enough people locally to fill vacancies. Prof Portes, a professor of economics at King's College London, was asked by the Welsh Government to consider the possible impact. ""That will hit Wales somewhat harder than the rest of the country,"" he said. ""Migrants from the EU are not just people who work on farms, quite a large proportion work in manufacturing. ""Although average full-time earnings for the UK as a whole are not far off Â£30,000, in Wales they're significantly below Â£30,000."" Travelodge targets parents for Brexit gap EU migrants '11% of manufacturing workforce' Has immigration held down wages? Prof Portes said there was a worry the UK would be ""a less attractive destination for skilled European migrants when free movement ends"" Prof Portes' report calls for the Welsh Government and businesses to press for a lower threshold, claiming Â£20,000 would ""mitigate modestly"" the potential impact. He said ""quite a few European migrants who are doing what you might call semi-skilled or medium-skilled jobs"", such as manufacturing, would be caught by the Â£30,000 threshold. The Home Office said: ""The new immigration system, operating from 2021, is designed to help drive up wages and productivity across the UK economy, including in Wales, and will support businesses, communities and our public services. ""We are making every effort to understand the specific needs of the whole of the UK, which is why we are engaging with business, devolved administrations and the public about our plans throughout 2019."" William Watkin says he is worried about the impact the proposed rules would have on his firm Water and soft drinks bottling company Radnor Hills, in Knighton, Powys, relies on migrant workers for 30% of its staff. Chief executive officer William Watkins said: ""We're trying to employ people locally as well... but here in mid Wales there really isn't so many people about, so it's been crucial to fill those gaps with Eastern European labour. ""This Â£30,000 figure is crazy, absolutely mad. We need lots of people under the Â£30,000 and particularly in the food and drink industry. ""That being a set threshold - I think - for the food industry would spell disaster. ""I'm really worried about the potential impact it could have on us if we weren't able to get Eastern European labour.""

"Despite numerous appeals, searches, arrests and interviews, Claudia Lawrence's case remains unsolved A man seen near the home of missing Claudia Lawrence remains a key person to trace 10 years on, police have said. The chef, 35, failed to arrive for work at York University on 19 March, 2009. The case remains unsolved and although no body has been found, North Yorkshire Police believe she was murdered. Speaking on the anniversary of the disappearance, Det Supt Dai Malyn reiterated his belief that information was being withheld and that the answer ""lies locally"". What happened to Claudia? The case has been hampered in the last decade by a lack of data and information from phones or social media, and poor CCTV coverage around Miss Lawrence's home in Heworth, in York. During the original investigation and a review five years later, CCTV images were released of a man seen near an alley behind the house both on the morning of her disappearance and the night before. This video can not be played Police still want to trace a man seen on CCTV near missing Claudia Lawrence's home. Footage shows him walking into Heworth Place, which leads to the back of her home, before reappearing a minute later, on both occasions. ""I cannot fully accept anything as to the identity of a suggested person, i.e. the man near the alleyway behind Claudia's home, unless we have conclusive evidence to back the information up,"" said Det Supt Malyn. ""The call we really want is the one that helps piece together the parts of the jigsaw we already know regarding her last movements and people she associated with and places frequented."" The mystery of the Milk Carton Kids The city with no homeless on its streets Can a fugitive remain on the run forever? Miss Lawrence was last heard from by her mother Joan, who she spoke to on the phone on the evening of 18 March 2009. She failed to arrive for her job at Goodricke College the following day and was reported missing by her father, Peter. Miss Lawrence's last known contact was when she spoke to her mother on the phone from her home on 18 March Police said the investigation had been difficult because Miss Lawrence did not use social media or own a smartphone. Det Supt Malyn said he did not believe she had been the victim of a stranger attack because analysis of her mobile showed it had been deliberately turned off on 19 March while still in the York area. Nine individuals have been arrested or interviewed in connection with the case, but no charges have been brought. It has since been wound down but police said they would investigate any new leads.

The retired engineer was killed while praying, his wife told the New Zealand Herald. ""We should be strong, especially in this case. I lose my husband but I'm not angry.

"This video can not be played PM Jacinda Ardern says details of gun law reforms will come within days New Zealand PM Jacinda Ardern has said she will announce detailed gun law reforms within days, after an attack on two mosques left 50 people dead. Ms Ardern said her cabinet had backed gun law changes ""in principle"". Australian Brenton Tarrant, 28, a self-described white supremacist, has been charged with murder. Police say the killer used military-style assault weapons modified to make them more deadly - which is not illegal under current legislation. What are New Zealand's gun laws? Stories of heroism emerge from NZ attacks Who are the victims? The prime minister gave no details at her press conference on Monday but said they would made clear soon. ""This ultimately means that within 10 days of this horrific act of terrorism, we will have announced reforms which will, I believe, make our community safer,"" she said. Ms Ardern was appearing alongside her coalition partner and Deputy PM Winston Peters, who has previously opposed changes to gun laws. Erdogan criticised for showing NZ video# Social sites seek to stop NZ attack clips The 'precious' mosque where peace was shattered Mr Peters said he fully supported the prime minister on the issue, adding: ""The reality is that after 1pm on Friday, our world changed forever and so will our laws."" Ms Ardern said: ""We have made a decision as a cabinet. We are unified."" She also announced that an inquiry would look into the lead-up to the attacks, and what might have been done differently. At the weekend, Ms Ardern said the suspect had a gun licence, obtained in November 2017, and owned five guns. Weaponry shown in the footage circulating of the attack Earlier on Monday, gun retailer Gun City said it had sold four weapons to the alleged gunman online, but it did not sell him the high-powered weapon used in the mosque shootings. CEO David Tipple told a news conference in Christchurch it had only sold him A-category weapons. Under New Zealand's gun laws, A-category weapons can be semi-automatic but limited to seven shots. Video footage of the attacks appeared to show the gunman's weapon had a magazine with a larger capacity, which is also available legally. There are an estimated 1.5 million privately owned firearms in the country. This video can not be played Christchurch students perform Haka for shooting victims Since the attack there have been calls for semi-automatic weapons to be banned. Previous attempts to tighten gun laws have failed due to a strong gun lobby and a culture of hunting. The minimum legal age to own a gun in New Zealand is 16, or 18 for military-style semi-automatic weapons. Anyone over those ages who is considered by police to be ""fit and proper"" can possess a firearm All gun-owners must have a licence, but most individual weapons do not have to be registered. New Zealand is one of the few countries where this is the case Applicants for a firearms licence must pass a background check of criminal and medical records Once a licence has been issued, gun owners can buy as many weapons as they want Footage of the killings was live-streamed by the attacker. On Sunday police said it was now classified as an objectionable publication and therefore it was an offence to distribute or possess the material. How the attacks unfolded More about the suspect An 18-year-old appeared in court on Monday, charged with distributing the live-stream. The teenager was also charged with publishing a photograph of the mosque with the message ""target acquired"" and faces a maximum of 14 years in prison for each charge, according to the prosecution. Facebook said it had removed 1.5 million videos of the attack around the world in the first 24 hours. By Jay Savage, BBC News, Christchurch Many returned to work and school on Monday, but little about it felt ordinary. If anything, the signs of the city's emotions became more visible. Flowers left at the main tribute site swelled, easily doubling what was there a day earlier. Outside Al Noor mosque, hundreds of people attended an afternoon vigil. It featured a thundering haka, performed by dozens of schoolchildren. Other students stood together singing softly or linking arms in silence. A few cried openly. The importance of coming together was the main topic of conversation. This video can not be played New Zealand church-goers rally to help mosque attack victims Nine people remain in hospital in a critical condition. This video can not be played Farid Ahmed: ""I have forgiven him and I will pray for him"" Frustration is building among relatives over the release of the bodies of the dead for burial. The first release was approved on Sunday but the family say another relative was killed and they want them released together. No burials will take place on Monday. Islamic tradition calls for the cleansing and burial of bodies as soon as possible after death. Brenton Tarrant on Monday fired his state-appointed lawyer, Richard Peters. Mr Peters says the defendant has indicated he ""wants to be self-represented in this case"". Brenton Tarrant appeared in court on Saturday charged with murder. Images of the defendant must be shown obscured under New Zealand law The lawyer added: ""The way he presented was rational and someone who was not suffering any mental disability. He seemed to understand what was going on."" Australian police raided two homes near Sydney on Mondayas part of the inquiry. Australian media reported that one of the homes belongs to Brenton Tarrant's sister. The family is co-operating with the authorities. An uncle of Brenton Tarrant said: ""We are so sorry for the families over there, for the dead and injured."" New Zealand police confirmed on Monday they believed there was only one attacker, but added that this did not rule out others might have provided support.

"Lauren Bullock, 17, Morgan Barnard, 17, and 16-year-old Connor Currie died after the incident Three teenagers have died after reports of a crush at a St Patrick's Day party at a hotel in Cookstown, County Tyrone. Lauren Bullock, 17, Morgan Barnard, 17, and 16-year-old Connor Currie, died after the incident outside the Greenvale Hotel on Sunday night. The police said a large group of young people had been waiting to get into a disco at about 21:30 GMT. ""No matter how much we screamed and pushed back, there was no movement,"" said eyewitness Eimear Tallon. 'Then the literal crushing started' One of the teenagers died at the scene. A number of other teenagers were also treated in hospital. Ms Bullock was a pupil at St Patrick's College in Dungannon and her principal, Catherine McHugh, described her as a ""shining light"". The two boys were pupils of St Patrick's Academy in Dungannon, where a prayer service has been held. Principal Fintan Donnelly said the tragedy had had a ""huge impact on the whole school community"".

""We offer our heartfelt sympathies to the families and friends of the three young people who have lost their lives,"" he said. He added that management and staff were assisting the police in their investigations. Police Service of Northern Ireland Assistant Chief Constable Mark Hamilton said: ""Our preliminary investigations show there was a crush towards the front door of this hotel, and in that crush people seem to have fallen. ""There seemed to be a little bit of struggling going on to get people up off the ground and that might explain also why there was a report of some fighting."" He added: ""It is heartbreaking that an event which should have been fun for these youngsters on St Patrick's night should end in such a terrible tragedy."" A teenage eye witness told the BBC people were ""pushing and shoving each other, trying to get closer to the gates"" of the Greenvale Hotel. He said the disco was the most popular in the area and often attracted large crowds. Another teenage eyewitness, who did not wish to be named,told the Ulster Herald he was waiting outside the hotel when a ""stampede"" started.,external ""We were all outside waiting for the gate to open and get in,"" he told the paper.

Northern Ireland Ambulance Service's medical director Dr Nigel Ruddell said: ""Everything points towards it being a tragic accident."" ""It was clearly a very distressing scene for all those who were caught up in the midst of it,"" he added. Paramedics, doctors and five emergency crews were dispatched to the venue at about 21:30. In a Facebook post at 22:27, the police asked parents to collect their children from the hotel immediately.

"A policeman stands guard outside Al Noor mosque two days after the attacks Nasir Uddin gazes through the trees in the park towards the exterior wall and golden dome of the Al Noor mosque across the road. With a police perimeter still in place, it's as near as he can get. He looks at the building with tear-filled eyes. ""Now we are very sad,"" he says shakily as he stands in Christchurch's Hagley Park. A migrant from Bangladesh, Mr Uddin, 37, moved to this picturesque city on the east coast of New Zealand's South Island more than five years ago. An Al Noor regular, he would have been at the mosque on Friday if he hadn't had to work. The peace of Christchurch's largest mosque was shattered that day by a gunman who burst in and opened fire with semi-automatic weapons just after worshippers had gathered for congregational prayer. The shocking act of violence here and at another mosque in the city that left 50 people dead has caused outrage across the world, not least because the perpetrator live-streamed his murderous assault on Al Noor on Facebook via a head-mounted camera. Nasir Uddin: ""Now we are very sad"" The Al Noor mosque has always been ""very precious to us"", says Anjum Rahman of the Islamic Women's Council of New Zealand. ""When it was built, it was the southernmost mosque in the world."" Founded by the local Muslim community, Al Noor is notable for having brought together worshippers from highly diverse backgrounds across the Muslim world, among them refugees. Some of the known victims includea tech entrepreneur who was also a futsal star, and an elderly Afghan man who had escaped the Soviet invasion in the 1980s. They had all found a home in New Zealand. Victims from both shootings are believed to include people who had begun their lives in nations including Jordan, Egypt, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia, the United Arab Emirates, Afghanistan, Syria, Kuwait and India. Who were the victims? How the attacks unfolded Social media's role in attack For Ms Rahman, whose family has been in New Zealand since 1972, the diversity of the nation's mosques such as Al Noor shows how the local Muslim community had come ""to welcome everyone"". She says: ""I think New Zealand is probably the best example in the world where we have done that successfully. It didn't happen by accident. It's something that we worked on and our parents' generation worked on."" At Hagley Park, two joggers pause beneath a tree to observe a tiny collection of flowers and tributes. One becomes visibly emotional, her lip trembling as she is comforted by her companion. Seconds later, they are jogging again. For Eleanor Morgan, 53, it's a horrifying contrast to her usual experience of the Hagley Park area, a place that for her is the heart of Christchurch. ""It should have been their haven, their safe place,"" she says. ""We hope we find we can show some way to show our love."" Another visitor, Jawakar Selvaraj, 25, was in the park about 15 minutes before the shooting. Originally from India, he says he has felt frightened ever since Friday's events. ""I'm sure nothing will happen but there's a tinge of fear for an immigrant,"" he says. On the other side of the park, hundreds of people visit a larger collection of flowers and tributes. Many messages have been left there. ""We breathe the same air. We walk the same land. We bleed the same blood."" ""This is your home. And you should have been safe here."" ""Our hearts are with you, your family, your friends & your community. We feel your pain. We cry your tears."" ""Hug your loved ones close."" Another tribute is simply painted with the name ""Sayyad"", a reference to Sayyad Milne, a 14-year-old boy who was at the Al Noor mosque and isbelieved to be among the dead,external. Fridays at the Al Noor mosque were a time for people to come together, Mr Uddin says. ""Then we can meet our friends,"" he says. ""We can see our friends. Everything is fine here."" After hearing of the attacks, he began frantically calling people, but no-one answered. He knows at least two of his friends are dead, and is waiting for news on others. ""This thing that we feel is too painful.""

"The collision was said to have involved a ""modernised train"" and occurred during a signal trial Two subway trains have collided during a new signal system test in Hong Kong, halting services and threatening travel disruption for millions of commuters. The incident occurred between the Central and Admiralty stations before the service was open to the public early on Monday morning. While the trains had no passengers on board, both drivers were taken to hospital. Rail officials warned that repairs were likely to take ""quite a long time"". Network operator Mass Transit Railway (MTR) said sections of the Tsuen Wan Line had been suspended and urged commuters to avoid the route affected and to use other forms of transport if possible. MTR Corporation has said a failure with the new signal system was to blame for the crash,,externalHong Kong's South China Morning Post newspaper reports. An investigation has been launched. Neither of the two trains involved was carrying passengers at the time Further disruption was caused later on Monday morning when a woman fell on to the tracks at Kowloon Tong station, causing a temporary suspension of service in that area.

"The IRD faked a press release to discredit the Communist-backed World Federation of Democratic Youth British government officials forged documents to produce ""fake news stories"" during the Cold War, newly released files show. The Information Research Department (IRD) was the Foreign Office's secret propaganda unit. For 30 years it fed information to journalists and had its own news agencies too. Almost 2,000 of its files have been transferred to the National Archives since the start of 2019. The files cover the early 1960s - the heyday of the IRD, when it employed between 400 and 600 people, according to Paul Lashmar, author of Britain's Secret Propaganda War. In 1978, Mr Lashmar was part of the team of journalists who revealed the existence of the IRD. He says this is the first time their role faking documents has been exposed. The team was funded by the so-called ""secret vote"" - where government money not subject to parliamentary scrutiny was used. Part of the project involved working abroad, but it also fed information to London-based academics and correspondents. The Berlin wall, dividing the east and west of the German city, was a famous symbol of the Cold War Among the newly released files are lists of trusted journalists. In 1960 that included Neal Ascherson - then a young reporter at the Observer newspaper who was introduced to the IRD by Edward Crankshaw, a more senior Soviet specialist. ""I was taken to a London club and we had a nice lunch with Edward and myself and this gentleman,"" Mr Ascherson remembered. ""After I'd been looked over and tested... I was allowed to receive the news bulletin of eastern European 'product'."" The IRD information was delivered by hand and treated as secret - but Mr Ascherson said he ""very rapidly discovered it was completely useless"", since it contained ""stale, out of date"" news. He found the analysis ""childishâ¦ very cold warrior"", and says he never relied on the information. According to Mr Lashmar, the officials at the IRD were enjoying the game, competing with the other side. One complex scheme involved faking a press release from the World Federation of Democratic Youth (WFYD), a Communist-backed organisation based in Budapest. In 1963, African students in Bulgaria made international news. Scores had left the country, claiming racial discrimination, and the IRD decided to use this to ""intensify indignation... against Bloc countries"". National Archives missing 400 files Hong Kong-to-NI 'spoof' revealed On fake headed notepaper, the IRD circulated a press release to hundreds of newspapers and opinion formers - sending the releases via the British diplomatic bag which meant they would have the right postmark. The press release - reprinted in full by a news agency in Zanzibar - included an offensive statement that the Africans ""emerging from the jungle darkness of want, [they] were not equipped to understand that food, fuel and clothes were not freely attainable..."" African students were furious. The Nigerian student union said this was a declaration of ""white superiority"". Some weeks later, the WFYD insisted it had been a fake release. Most of the IRD's efforts were concentrated on foreign news, but occasionally they were employed in the UK. In 1962 Labour MP for Islington North, Gerry Reynolds, asked for their help. He feared his local Labour party was being taken over by ""a well-organised group of extreme left-wing malcontents, probably Trotskyists"", and wanted the IRD to dig up any information on the individuals concerned. A fake copy of the Times from North Korea, with communist propaganda inside The IRD turned to the security services, which confirmed that Dorothy Hayward had been a member of the Revolutionary Communist Party in 1947; that Sidney Lubin had endorsed a Communist council candidate in 1951; and that Francis Dunne had distributed a Trotskyite newsletter. This information was ""a bit stingy"", wrote one IRD officer whose disappointment suggested he had expected more information. Nonetheless, he passed it on to Mr Reynolds, who remained the MP there until 1969. It is not known what - if anything - happened to those people the IRD had named. The files show the IRD manufactured and distributed statements from the International Institute for Peace in Vienna on several occasions. It also faked posters from the International Union of Students, replacing the acronym ""US"" with Chinese characters, to turn an anti-US nuclear campaign into an anti-Chinese one. This is the first time that IRD's own forgeries have been revealed. At the time, it was keen to highlight forged documents produced by the Communists. They were known to be prolific: at one point a forged British cabinet paper was being circulated amongst African leaders. In North Korea and East Germany, such fakes were produced on an industrial scale, according to files recently released. Mr Lashmar said: ""Should a democracy be secretly putting out fake or forged material? No. If totalitarian people are manipulating thingsâ¦ that doesn't mean we should follow suit.""

"A report said Wales' manufacturing sector would be hit by the plans A proposed post-Brexit salary threshold for migrants would hit Wales harder than the rest of the UK, a leading economist has warned. Prof Jonathan Portes said the possible hit to the manufacturing sector was ""of particular concern"". A UK government consultation includesa minimum Â£30,000 salary for skilled migrantsseeking five-year visas. The Home Office said it would allow the UK to attract talented workers and deliver on the referendum result. One boss in mid Wales said his company employs 30% of its staff from EU countries, adding that there are not enough people locally to fill vacancies. Prof Portes, a professor of economics at King's College London, was asked by the Welsh Government to consider the possible impact. ""That will hit Wales somewhat harder than the rest of the country,"" he said. ""Migrants from the EU are not just people who work on farms, quite a large proportion work in manufacturing. ""Although average full-time earnings for the UK as a whole are not far off Â£30,000, in Wales they're significantly below Â£30,000."" Travelodge targets parents for Brexit gap EU migrants '11% of manufacturing workforce' Has immigration held down wages? Prof Portes said there was a worry the UK would be ""a less attractive destination for skilled European migrants when free movement ends"" Prof Portes' report calls for the Welsh Government and businesses to press for a lower threshold, claiming Â£20,000 would ""mitigate modestly"" the potential impact. He said ""quite a few European migrants who are doing what you might call semi-skilled or medium-skilled jobs"", such as manufacturing, would be caught by the Â£30,000 threshold. The Home Office said: ""The new immigration system, operating from 2021, is designed to help drive up wages and productivity across the UK economy, including in Wales, and will support businesses, communities and our public services. ""We are making every effort to understand the specific needs of the whole of the UK, which is why we are engaging with business, devolved administrations and the public about our plans throughout 2019."" William Watkin says he is worried about the impact the proposed rules would have on his firm Water and soft drinks bottling company Radnor Hills, in Knighton, Powys, relies on migrant workers for 30% of its staff. Chief executive officer William Watkins said: ""We're trying to employ people locally as well... but here in mid Wales there really isn't so many people about, so it's been crucial to fill those gaps with Eastern European labour. ""This Â£30,000 figure is crazy, absolutely mad. We need lots of people under the Â£30,000 and particularly in the food and drink industry. ""That being a set threshold - I think - for the food industry would spell disaster. ""I'm really worried about the potential impact it could have on us if we weren't able to get Eastern European labour.""

Its services have been hit by delays with long queues due to industrial action by French customs officers. Four trains were cancelled on Sunday. The firm has also cancelled three trains on Monday, two on Tuesday and three on Wednesday. The company says tickets can be changed free of charge, or affected passengers can claim refunds. ""We recommend not to travel unless absolutely necessary, ""Eurostar advised passengers,externalon its website. ""All Eurostar trains are experiencing delays and long queues for journeys from Paris Nord due to industrial action by French customs until March 19th. ""These delays impact our planned timetables and cause subsequent cancellations,"" the firm said. Customs officers are demanding higher pay and better working conditions. They also want more staff which they say will be needed after Brexit, to help process British citizens who will no longer have European Union passports. The industrial action is due to last until 19 March. Brexit and holidays: What do I need to know? Passengers have been complaining on social media of long queues in Paris.

"The infra-red images show the water saturation of the building A survey has revealed the water damage to the Hill House in Helensburgh. The property, designed by Charles Rennie Mackintosh, has been threatened by the effects of water penetration. Owners the National Trust for Scotland (NTS) and Historic Environment Scotland used infra-red technology to show how damp and water has damaged the building. A mesh structure is being constructed around the building to protect it from the weather while it is restored. Hill House appeal passes Â£1m milestone Appeal to see Hill House 'boxed' 'Giant cage' to save Mackintosh landmark A previous infra-red survey from 2003 has been combined with the new images and further surveys to allow conservationists to pinpoint the worst affected areas and understand why the property's condition is declining. This video can not be played Mackintosh house is surrounded by cage The technique highlights differences in surface temperature, which shows where moisture from decades of wet weather has accumulated within the building. The Hill House was finished in 1904, but a century of Scottish weather has taken its toll. Rennie Mackintosh had envisioned it as ""a home for the future"" and used experimental building material - which has allowed water to soak into the building. Richard Williams, of the National Trust for Scotland, said: ""These surveys reinforce what we already knew about the house, which is that it is very damp and has considerable issues that need to be overcome. The house will be protected by the temporary structure while work is carried out ""Due to the design of the Hill House, there are many ledges, wall heads and chimneys that have had a history of many attempts to remedy, yet this problem continues. ""We're also now have additional areas of concern. We have also been able to see the direction that the water is travelling in some of the rooms, in particular in the exhibition room, where there was already clear damage. ""The works to create the 'box' are now well under way and we are grateful to the many individuals who have generously donated to help us to tackle these problems. The intention is that the structure will provide a temporary respite for the Hill House pending a long-term solution to the water ingress being found."" The house and gardens are currently closed to the public but are expected to reopen in late spring.

"Despite numerous appeals, searches, arrests and interviews, Claudia Lawrence's case remains unsolved A man seen near the home of missing Claudia Lawrence remains a key person to trace 10 years on, police have said. The chef, 35, failed to arrive for work at York University on 19 March, 2009. The case remains unsolved and although no body has been found, North Yorkshire Police believe she was murdered. Speaking on the anniversary of the disappearance, Det Supt Dai Malyn reiterated his belief that information was being withheld and that the answer ""lies locally"". What happened to Claudia? The case has been hampered in the last decade by a lack of data and information from phones or social media, and poor CCTV coverage around Miss Lawrence's home in Heworth, in York. During the original investigation and a review five years later, CCTV images were released of a man seen near an alley behind the house both on the morning of her disappearance and the night before. This video can not be played Police still want to trace a man seen on CCTV near missing Claudia Lawrence's home. Footage shows him walking into Heworth Place, which leads to the back of her home, before reappearing a minute later, on both occasions. ""I cannot fully accept anything as to the identity of a suggested person, i.e. the man near the alleyway behind Claudia's home, unless we have conclusive evidence to back the information up,"" said Det Supt Malyn. ""The call we really want is the one that helps piece together the parts of the jigsaw we already know regarding her last movements and people she associated with and places frequented."" The mystery of the Milk Carton Kids The city with no homeless on its streets Can a fugitive remain on the run forever? Miss Lawrence was last heard from by her mother Joan, who she spoke to on the phone on the evening of 18 March 2009. She failed to arrive for her job at Goodricke College the following day and was reported missing by her father, Peter. Miss Lawrence's last known contact was when she spoke to her mother on the phone from her home on 18 March Police said the investigation had been difficult because Miss Lawrence did not use social media or own a smartphone. Det Supt Malyn said he did not believe she had been the victim of a stranger attack because analysis of her mobile showed it had been deliberately turned off on 19 March while still in the York area. Nine individuals have been arrested or interviewed in connection with the case, but no charges have been brought. It has since been wound down but police said they would investigate any new leads.

"This video can not be played Philip Hammond: ""We will only bring the deal back if we are confident that enough of our colleagues and the DUP are prepared to support it"" Theresa May's Brexit deal will not return to the Commons this week unless it has support from the DUP and Tory MPs, the chancellor says. The PM's plan is expected to be voted on for a third time in the coming days. But Philip Hammond told the BBC's Andrew Marr that it would only be put to MPs if ""enough of our colleagues and the DUP are prepared to support it"". He did not rule out a financial settlement for Northern Ireland if the DUP backed the deal. The party, which has 10 MPs in the Commons, negotiated Â£1bn in spending for Northern Ireland as part of a confidence and supply agreement with the Tories - giving the government a working majority. Mr Hammond said they did not have the numbers ""yet"" to secure Mrs May's deal, adding: ""It is a work in progress"". But he warned that, even with the DUP's support, a ""short extension"" would be needed to pass legislation in Parliament, adding that it was now ""physically impossible"" for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said Mrs May risked ""destroying all confidence in our political system"" if her government was planning to give the DUP ""another bung"". Brexit: A really simple guide What's happened with Brexit this week? Will EU leaders agree to extending Brexit? The prime minister has asked MPs to make an ""honourable compromise"" on her deal. Writing in the Sunday Telegraph,,externalshe said failure to support it would mean ""we will not leave the EU for many months, if ever"". Meanwhile, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has written to MPs across the Commons inviting them for talks to find a cross-party compromise. He also told Sky's Sophie Ridge that Labour MPs could be told to vote in favour of an amendment calling for another referendum next week, and he could propose another vote of no confidence in the government if the PM's deal was voted down for a third time. Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button Earlier last week MPs rejected Theresa May's deal again - this time by 149 votes - and then backed plans to rule out leaving the EU without a deal. They also voted in favour of an extension to the process - either until 30 June if Mrs May's deal is supported before 20 March, or a longer one that could include taking part in European elections if MPs reject her plan for a third time. But legally the UK is still due to leave the EU on 29 March. All 27 EU member states would have to agree to an extension, and the countries' leaders are expected to discuss it at a summit on Thursday. Mr Hammond told Andrew Marr that it was now ""physically impossible"" for the UK to leave on 29 March. ""If the prime minister's deal is able to muster a majority this week and get through, then we will need a short extension,"" he said. ""But if we are unable to do that - if we are unable to bring a majority together to support what in my view is a very good deal for Britain - then we will have to look at a longer extension and we are in uncharted territory."" Asked if the deal would be voted on again this week, the chancellor said: ""The answer to that is no - not definitely. ""We will only bring the deal back if we are confident that enough of our colleagues and the DUP are prepared to support it so we can get it through Parliament. ""We are not just going to keep presenting it if we haven't moved the dial."" A group of 15 Tory MPs from Leave-backing constituencies, including former Brexit Secretary David Davis, have written a letter urging colleagues to back the deal to ensure Brexit goes ahead. And former Cabinet minister Esther McVey,who resigned over the Brexit agreement, told Sky's Sophy Ridge programme that she would ""hold my nose"" and vote for the deal after rejecting it twice herself, as it was now a choice between ""this deal or no Brexit"". Asked on BBC Radio 5 Live's Pienaar's Politics whether it would be a good idea for Mrs May to confirm she would leave Number 10 by the summer, Ms McVey said only the PM knew what was best for her but she needed ""a dignified departure"". Charlie Elphicke, Conservative MP for Dover, told the BBC there needed to be ""a change of leadership"" for him to support the deal, while Nigel Evans, Tory MP for Ribble Valley, said Mrs May should quit if there was a long delay to Brexit and the UK ended up contesting European elections. This video can not be played Earlier this week, Esther McVey said: ""People will have to vote for deal if they want Brexit"". Mr Corbyn has offered talks with opposition leaders and backbench MPs in an effort to find a Brexit compromise which could replace Mrs May's plan. The Labour leader has invited Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable, DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds, SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford, Plaid's Liz Saville Roberts and Green MP Caroline Lucas. In his letter, he called for urgent meetings to find a ""solution that ends the needless uncertainty and worry"" caused by Mrs May's ""failed"" Brexit negotiations. Meanwhile, Tory MP Nick Boles has pledged to stay in the Conservative Party, despitequitting his local association over an ongoing row about Brexit.

"Lauren Bullock, 17, Morgan Barnard, 17, and 16-year-old Connor Currie died after the incident Three teenagers have died after reports of a crush at a St Patrick's Day party at a hotel in Cookstown, County Tyrone. Lauren Bullock, 17, Morgan Barnard, 17, and 16-year-old Connor Currie, died after the incident outside the Greenvale Hotel on Sunday night. The police said a large group of young people had been waiting to get into a disco at about 21:30 GMT. ""No matter how much we screamed and pushed back, there was no movement,"" said eyewitness Eimear Tallon. 'Then the literal crushing started' One of the teenagers died at the scene. A number of other teenagers were also treated in hospital. Ms Bullock was a pupil at St Patrick's College in Dungannon and her principal, Catherine McHugh, described her as a ""shining light"". The two boys were pupils of St Patrick's Academy in Dungannon, where a prayer service has been held. Principal Fintan Donnelly said the tragedy had had a ""huge impact on the whole school community"". This video can not be played 'Everybody just wanted to get inside' - Cookstown witness Kyra Coyle Edendork Gaelic football club said it was ""devastated to hear of the tragic passing of our much loved and highly thought of player and member Connor Currie"".

Online tributes have been paid to Ms Bullock byEuphoria All Star Cheerleading NI,external, where she was described as an ""incredible cheerleader and the back bone of our team"". Describing Ms Bullock as ""the most down to earth, beautiful soul"", the club said members were ""absolutely devastated"". Greenvale Hotel owner Michael McElhatton said he was ""deeply shocked and saddened by the traumatic events"". ""We offer our heartfelt sympathies to the families and friends of the three young people who have lost their lives,"" he said. He added that management and staff were assisting the police in their investigations. Police Service of Northern Ireland Assistant Chief Constable Mark Hamilton said: ""Our preliminary investigations show there was a crush towards the front door of this hotel, and in that crush people seem to have fallen. ""There seemed to be a little bit of struggling going on to get people up off the ground and that might explain also why there was a report of some fighting."" He added: ""It is heartbreaking that an event which should have been fun for these youngsters on St Patrick's night should end in such a terrible tragedy."" A teenage eye witness told the BBC people were ""pushing and shoving each other, trying to get closer to the gates"" of the Greenvale Hotel. He said the disco was the most popular in the area and often attracted large crowds. Another teenage eyewitness, who did not wish to be named,told the Ulster Herald he was waiting outside the hotel when a ""stampede"" started.,external ""We were all outside waiting for the gate to open and get in,"" he told the paper. ""Then everyone just started swaying back and forth and pushing from side to side. ""Suddenly there was a rush forward and the whole queue collapsed and everyone fell to the ground."" This video can not be played ACC Mark Hamilton: 'There was a crush towards the front door' The teenager said he was pinned to the floor with other people on top of him and unable to move for 20 minutes, adding that there were more than 100 people involved in the queue crush. Northern Ireland Ambulance Service's medical director Dr Nigel Ruddell said: ""Everything points towards it being a tragic accident."" ""It was clearly a very distressing scene for all those who were caught up in the midst of it,"" he added. Paramedics, doctors and five emergency crews were dispatched to the venue at about 21:30. In a Facebook post at 22:27, the police asked parents to collect their children from the hotel immediately. ACC Hamilton said the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service had received a 999 call on Sunday night with reports of people injured outside the hotel. They declared it a major incident and police, the fire service and environmental health staff then also attended the scene.

"Police officers stand guard near the scene of the deadly shooting in New Zealand The Christchurch mosque attacks were live-streamed on the internet by a man posting online under the name Brenton Tarrant. He said he was Australian. Distressing footage shows him firing indiscriminately at men, women and children at close range inside the Al Noor mosque on Friday. The individual had previously posted a rambling and expletive-filled document, espousing violent right-wing ideology. Reaction to the attacks A day later, the 28 year old appeared in court in Christchurch, charged with murder. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the suspect had ""travelled around the world with sporadic periods of time spent in New Zealand"" and that he was currently living in Dunedin, south of Christchurch. ""I would not describe him as a long-term resident,"" she said ""The offender was in possession of a gun licence. I'm advised that this was acquired in November of 2017."" She said New Zealand intelligence services had been stepping up investigations into far-right extremists, but added: ""The individual charged with murder had not come to the attention of the intelligence community nor the police for extremism."" Brenton Tarrant appeared in court in Christchurch in a white prison uniform. He was remanded in custody, with no bail application made. State-appointed lawyer Richard Peters says the defendant fired him and wanted to represent himself. ""The way he presented was rational and someone who was not suffering any mental disability,"" Mr Peters said. ""He seemed to understand what was going on."" The man in the footage equipped himself with what appears to be a head-mounted camera to live-stream the attack in central Christchurch. The streams were broadcast online, including briefly on Facebook, showing the violence in graphic detail. A song which played in the suspect's car is known as a marching anthem for Serbian nationalist paramilitary units known as Chetniks during the 1992-95 Bosnian war. It praises Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, who was convicted of genocide and war crimes. Weaponry shown in the footage circulating of the attack The names of men convicted of killing Muslims and migrants are written on the suspect's weaponry. One item has the words ""For Rotherham"" written on it, a reference to a child abuse scandal in the UK, while other wording references historical battles between European countries and the Ottoman Empire. Australian media reported that Brenton Tarrant was originally from Grafton, a town 600km (370 miles) north of Sydney, and had previously worked at a fitness facility. ""He never showed any extremist views or any crazy behaviour,""his former boss, Tracey Gray, told Seven News,external. The 16,500-word document he posted is entitled The Great Replacement - a phrase that originated in France and has become a rallying cry for European anti-immigration extremists. In it, the man says he began planning an attack after visiting Europe in 2017 and being angered by events there. This video can not be played New Zealand PM Jacinda Ardern: 'This can only be described as a terrorist attack' Specifically, he referencesa lorry attack carried out by an Islamic State sympathiser in Sweden, France's decision to elect the moderate Emmanuel Macron as president, and ethnic diversity in France. Despite insisting that he is not motivated by fame, he acknowledges that he intends to survive the attack, and hopes it will spread fear. He chose the Al Noor mosque as his target three months ago, the document says. The central tenet of the conspiracy is that ""European peoples"" are dying out and being ""replaced"" by immigrants with a different, inferior and dangerous culture, says the BBC's Dominic Casciani. This is basically a code for hatred or fear of Muslims - part of the theory is that states and corporations are encouraging ""white genocide"" by pushing up immigration rates to keep global capitalism going, says our correspondent. Brenton Tarrant has travelled frequently, venturing to North Korea, Europe, Turkey and Pakistan. Bulgarian prosecutor general Sotir Tsatsarov said he visited Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro and Serbia in 2016, stopping at historic battle sites in the area. He returned to Eastern Europe in November 2018 where he saw more historic sites in Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania. Mr Tsatsarov said Bulgaria is now investigating whether he had ties with people in the country. Brenton Tarrant travelled extensively, but grew up in the Australian town of Grafton Turkish officials have confirmed he visited Turkey several times, and reportedly said an investigation was under way into his ""movements and contacts within the country"". A hotel owner in the far-north of Pakistan told the BBC that Brenton Tarrant had spent two nights in the area in October 2018. Syed Israr Hussain, who runs the Osho Thang hotel, said Tarrant expressed no visible hostility to Muslims or Islam. He said he was travelling alone and ""walked around the local area"" taking pictures like any other tourist. The area is popular with trekkers. A now deleted post on Mr Hussain's social media account from last October is attributed to Brenton Tarrant and reads: ""Pakistan is an incredible place filled with the most earnest kind hearted and hospitable people in the world."" Mr Hussain said Brenton Tarrant left those comments ""for the world to see"". He added he was ""shocked"" by the attack in Christchurch. There are also reports that Tarrant visited Afghanistan and China's Xinjiang region. Four people were arrested in the aftermath of the attack - three men and a woman, who was subsequently released without charge. Police say they do not believe they were connected to the attack. Of those, two remain in custody: a man who apparently went to help carrying a rifle, who has been charged with a firearms offence an 18-year-old, who appeared in court on Monday, charged with distributing the live-stream Prime Minister Ardern said none of those in custody had been on active security watch lists in New Zealand or Australia. This video can not be played Eyewitnesses have reported running for their lives to escape a shooter. ""I have asked our agencies this morning to work swiftly on assessing whether there was any activity on social media or otherwise, that should have triggered a response,"" the prime minister said.

"A policeman stands guard outside Al Noor mosque two days after the attacks Nasir Uddin gazes through the trees in the park towards the exterior wall and golden dome of the Al Noor mosque across the road. With a police perimeter still in place, it's as near as he can get. He looks at the building with tear-filled eyes. ""Now we are very sad,"" he says shakily as he stands in Christchurch's Hagley Park. A migrant from Bangladesh, Mr Uddin, 37, moved to this picturesque city on the east coast of New Zealand's South Island more than five years ago. An Al Noor regular, he would have been at the mosque on Friday if he hadn't had to work. The peace of Christchurch's largest mosque was shattered that day by a gunman who burst in and opened fire with semi-automatic weapons just after worshippers had gathered for congregational prayer. The shocking act of violence here and at another mosque in the city that left 50 people dead has caused outrage across the world, not least because the perpetrator live-streamed his murderous assault on Al Noor on Facebook via a head-mounted camera. Nasir Uddin: ""Now we are very sad"" The Al Noor mosque has always been ""very precious to us"", says Anjum Rahman of the Islamic Women's Council of New Zealand. ""When it was built, it was the southernmost mosque in the world."" Founded by the local Muslim community, Al Noor is notable for having brought together worshippers from highly diverse backgrounds across the Muslim world, among them refugees. Some of the known victims includea tech entrepreneur who was also a futsal star, and an elderly Afghan man who had escaped the Soviet invasion in the 1980s. They had all found a home in New Zealand. Victims from both shootings are believed to include people who had begun their lives in nations including Jordan, Egypt, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia, the United Arab Emirates, Afghanistan, Syria, Kuwait and India. Who were the victims? How the attacks unfolded Social media's role in attack For Ms Rahman, whose family has been in New Zealand since 1972, the diversity of the nation's mosques such as Al Noor shows how the local Muslim community had come ""to welcome everyone"". She says: ""I think New Zealand is probably the best example in the world where we have done that successfully. It didn't happen by accident. It's something that we worked on and our parents' generation worked on."" At Hagley Park, two joggers pause beneath a tree to observe a tiny collection of flowers and tributes. One becomes visibly emotional, her lip trembling as she is comforted by her companion. Seconds later, they are jogging again. For Eleanor Morgan, 53, it's a horrifying contrast to her usual experience of the Hagley Park area, a place that for her is the heart of Christchurch. ""It should have been their haven, their safe place,"" she says. ""We hope we find we can show some way to show our love."" Another visitor, Jawakar Selvaraj, 25, was in the park about 15 minutes before the shooting. Originally from India, he says he has felt frightened ever since Friday's events. ""I'm sure nothing will happen but there's a tinge of fear for an immigrant,"" he says. On the other side of the park, hundreds of people visit a larger collection of flowers and tributes. Many messages have been left there. ""We breathe the same air. We walk the same land. We bleed the same blood."" ""This is your home. And you should have been safe here."" ""Our hearts are with you, your family, your friends & your community. We feel your pain. We cry your tears."" ""Hug your loved ones close."" Another tribute is simply painted with the name ""Sayyad"", a reference to Sayyad Milne, a 14-year-old boy who was at the Al Noor mosque and isbelieved to be among the dead,external. Fridays at the Al Noor mosque were a time for people to come together, Mr Uddin says. ""Then we can meet our friends,"" he says. ""We can see our friends. Everything is fine here."" After hearing of the attacks, he began frantically calling people, but no-one answered. He knows at least two of his friends are dead, and is waiting for news on others. ""This thing that we feel is too painful.""

"This video can not be played PM Jacinda Ardern says details of gun law reforms will come within days New Zealand PM Jacinda Ardern has said she will announce detailed gun law reforms within days, after an attack on two mosques left 50 people dead. Ms Ardern said her cabinet had backed gun law changes ""in principle"". Australian Brenton Tarrant, 28, a self-described white supremacist, has been charged with murder. Police say the killer used military-style assault weapons modified to make them more deadly - which is not illegal under current legislation. What are New Zealand's gun laws? Stories of heroism emerge from NZ attacks Who are the victims? The prime minister gave no details at her press conference on Monday but said they would made clear soon. ""This ultimately means that within 10 days of this horrific act of terrorism, we will have announced reforms which will, I believe, make our community safer,"" she said. Ms Ardern was appearing alongside her coalition partner and Deputy PM Winston Peters, who has previously opposed changes to gun laws. Erdogan criticised for showing NZ video# Social sites seek to stop NZ attack clips The 'precious' mosque where peace was shattered Mr Peters said he fully supported the prime minister on the issue, adding: ""The reality is that after 1pm on Friday, our world changed forever and so will our laws."" Ms Ardern said: ""We have made a decision as a cabinet. We are unified."" She also announced that an inquiry would look into the lead-up to the attacks, and what might have been done differently. At the weekend, Ms Ardern said the suspect had a gun licence, obtained in November 2017, and owned five guns. Weaponry shown in the footage circulating of the attack Earlier on Monday, gun retailer Gun City said it had sold four weapons to the alleged gunman online, but it did not sell him the high-powered weapon used in the mosque shootings. CEO David Tipple told a news conference in Christchurch it had only sold him A-category weapons. Under New Zealand's gun laws, A-category weapons can be semi-automatic but limited to seven shots. Video footage of the attacks appeared to show the gunman's weapon had a magazine with a larger capacity, which is also available legally. There are an estimated 1.5 million privately owned firearms in the country. This video can not be played Christchurch students perform Haka for shooting victims Since the attack there have been calls for semi-automatic weapons to be banned. Previous attempts to tighten gun laws have failed due to a strong gun lobby and a culture of hunting. The minimum legal age to own a gun in New Zealand is 16, or 18 for military-style semi-automatic weapons. Anyone over those ages who is considered by police to be ""fit and proper"" can possess a firearm All gun-owners must have a licence, but most individual weapons do not have to be registered. New Zealand is one of the few countries where this is the case Applicants for a firearms licence must pass a background check of criminal and medical records Once a licence has been issued, gun owners can buy as many weapons as they want Footage of the killings was live-streamed by the attacker. On Sunday police said it was now classified as an objectionable publication and therefore it was an offence to distribute or possess the material. How the attacks unfolded More about the suspect An 18-year-old appeared in court on Monday, charged with distributing the live-stream. The teenager was also charged with publishing a photograph of the mosque with the message ""target acquired"" and faces a maximum of 14 years in prison for each charge, according to the prosecution. Facebook said it had removed 1.5 million videos of the attack around the world in the first 24 hours. By Jay Savage, BBC News, Christchurch Many returned to work and school on Monday, but little about it felt ordinary. If anything, the signs of the city's emotions became more visible. Flowers left at the main tribute site swelled, easily doubling what was there a day earlier. Outside Al Noor mosque, hundreds of people attended an afternoon vigil. It featured a thundering haka, performed by dozens of schoolchildren. Other students stood together singing softly or linking arms in silence. A few cried openly. The importance of coming together was the main topic of conversation. This video can not be played New Zealand church-goers rally to help mosque attack victims Nine people remain in hospital in a critical condition. This video can not be played Farid Ahmed: ""I have forgiven him and I will pray for him"" Frustration is building among relatives over the release of the bodies of the dead for burial. The first release was approved on Sunday but the family say another relative was killed and they want them released together. No burials will take place on Monday. Islamic tradition calls for the cleansing and burial of bodies as soon as possible after death. Brenton Tarrant on Monday fired his state-appointed lawyer, Richard Peters. Mr Peters says the defendant has indicated he ""wants to be self-represented in this case"". Brenton Tarrant appeared in court on Saturday charged with murder. Images of the defendant must be shown obscured under New Zealand law The lawyer added: ""The way he presented was rational and someone who was not suffering any mental disability. He seemed to understand what was going on."" Australian police raided two homes near Sydney on Mondayas part of the inquiry. Australian media reported that one of the homes belongs to Brenton Tarrant's sister. The family is co-operating with the authorities. An uncle of Brenton Tarrant said: ""We are so sorry for the families over there, for the dead and injured."" New Zealand police confirmed on Monday they believed there was only one attacker, but added that this did not rule out others might have provided support.

Lauren Bullock, 17, Morgan Barnard, 17, and 16-year-old Connor Currie, died after the incident outside the Greenvale Hotel on Sunday night. The police said a large group of young people had been waiting to get into a disco at about 21:30 GMT. ""No matter how much we screamed and pushed back, there was no movement,"" said eyewitness Eimear Tallon. 'Then the literal crushing started' One of the teenagers died at the scene.
