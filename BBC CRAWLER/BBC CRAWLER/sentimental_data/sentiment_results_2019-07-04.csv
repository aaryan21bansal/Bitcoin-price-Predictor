"The oil tanker is suspected of carrying crude oil to Syria Iran has summoned the British ambassador in Tehran to complain about what it says was the illegal seizure of an Iranian oil tanker. British Royal Marines helped the authorities in Gibraltar seize the ship because of evidence it was heading to Syria in breach of EU sanctions. Spain's acting foreign minister said the seizure of the ship - Grace 1 - was at the US's request. An Iranian foreign ministry spokesman called the actions a ""form of piracy"". The UK Foreign Office dismissed that as ""nonsense"". Gibraltar port and law enforcement agencies detained the super tanker and its cargo on Thursday morning with the help of the marines. The BBC has been told a team of about 30 marines, from 42 Commando, were flown from the UK to Gibraltar to help, at the request of the Gibraltar government. Royal Marines disembarking Grace 1 The first marines to board the Panama-flagged ship descended by rope from a helicopter, as others approached in speed boats. No shots were fired. A defence source described it as a ""relatively benign operation"" without major incident. However, Iran's foreign ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi was later quoted as saying the UK's ambassador in Tehran, Robert Macaire, had been summoned over the ""illegal seizure"" of the tanker. In a brief interview for Iranian TV's Channel Two, Mr Mousavi said the seizure was ""a form of piracy"" and did not have any legal and international basis. He called for the tanker to be immediately released to continue its journey. He added that ""the move indicated that the UK follows the hostile policies of the US, which is unacceptable for the Iranian nation and government"". BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale said while Britain has been keen to suggest it was an operation led by the Gibraltar government, it appears the intelligence came from the US. Spain's Acting Foreign Minister Josep Borrell said Spain was studying the circumstances of the action but said it followed ""a demand from the US to the UK"". Spain disputes British ownership of Gibraltar. White House national security advisor John Bolton said the seizure was ""excellent news"", saying the tanker laden with oil bound for Syria was violating EU sanctions. He added that the US and its allies would continue to prevent regimes in Tehran and Damascus from ""profiting off this illicit trade"". By James Robbins, BBC diplomatic correspondent It's clear that this seizure was to enforce EU sanctions against Syria, not US sanctions against Iran. But it looks as if both the US and the UK had been tracking the movements of Grace 1 throughout its curious voyage from the Gulf to the Mediterranean. Curious because such a valuable cargo of oil would normally be taken via the Suez Canal, even if that means using more than one vessel and transhipping the oil because not all super-tankers can squeeze through. It's a massive shortcut. Instead, in this instance the master took his vessel and controversial cargo the very long route around the southern tip of Africa - the Cape. Was that a smokescreen to conceal its apparent destination - the Mediterranean coast of Syria? The Americans were acutely interested because they are determined to prevent Iran profiting from oil sales which breach US sanctions. Britain, by contrast, would not have acted to enforce US measures. But when the super-tanker, all 330 metres of it, entered EU waters, specifically Gibraltar waters, the British authorities judged they had no choice but to enforce EU sanctions against Syria which the UK pushed for and strongly supports. Brussels was not involved in the seizure decision. It is not a matter for EU institutions to enforce customs law. That is a responsibility of member states. However, the Iranian charge that Britain was doing the Americans bidding may be hard to shake off. That matters because it fuels an Iranian conviction that Europe only pays lip service to its continuing commitment to the hard-won nuclear deal - the deal which Donald Trump repudiated and does not want to survive. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the swift action by the authorities in Gibraltar and the Royal Marines would deny valuable resources to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's ""murderous regime"". Gibraltar said there was reason to believe the ship was carrying Iranian crude oil to the Baniyas Refinery in the Syrian Mediterranean port town of Tartous. The refinery is a subsidiary of the General Corporation for Refining and Distribution of Petroleum Products, a section of the Syrian ministry of petroleum. The EU says,externalthe facility therefore provides financial support to the Syrian government, which is subject tosanctions,externalbecause of its repression of civilians since the start of the uprising against President Assad in 2011. The refinery has been subject toEU sanctions since 2014.,external US to hit Iran with 'major' sanctions How renewed US sanctions have hit Iran hard Gulf crisis: Are we heading for a new tanker war? This latest row comes at a time of escalating tensions between the US and Iran. The Trump administration - which has pulled out of an international agreement on Tehran's nuclear programme - has reinforced punishing sanctions against Iran. Its European allies, including the UK, have not followed suit. Also last month, the US accused Iran of attacking two oil tankers with mines just outside the Strait of Hormuz - an accusation denied by Iran. Days later, an unmanned US drone was shot down by Iranian forces in the Gulf. Iran said it had violated Iranian airspace and would send a ""clear message to America"". The US insisted the drone had been over international waters. President Donald Trump tweeted: ""Iran made a very big mistake!""

"The firearms officer who shot dead the ringleader of the 2017 London Bridge attack thought he would be killed when he challenged him, a jury has heard. The officer told the Old Bailey inquest into the deaths of the attackers that he feared Khuram Butt would ""stab me, kill me and get hold of my weapons"". Butt and two other men had just driven at pedestrians on the bridge and attacked people with knives in Borough Market - killing eight and injuring 48. All three were shot dead by police. The inquest is expected to go on for three weeks and, under law, must be heard by a jury. In just 10 minutes, Khuram Butt, 27, Rachid Redouane, 30, and Youssef Zaghba, 22, ploughed down pedestrians on the bridge and brought chaos to Borough Market, carrying knives and wearing fake suicide belts. Addressing the court anonymously, the officer identified only as BX46 said that as he arrived at the scene in an armed response vehicle at the end of a 12-hour shift, he was armed with a Glock 17 pistol, a Taser and a G36 carbine rifle. He said he ""feared the worst"" when the call came in, and that as he approached with his window down, he could hear people saying ""they're stabbing people"". He said he then saw an Asian man in a blue Arsenal top holding a large knife in a threatening manner. Although he couldn't recall the exact words he used, he said he believed he would have shouted: ""Armed police, stand still, drop the knife"". Khuram Butt was finally shot dead in Stoney Street, bringing an end to the attack He said the attacker did not obey the command, so he moved back to create some space between them. But the attacker - later identified as Khuram Butt - came towards him, raising his knife. ""I believe his intention was to use the knife and stab me, kill me and get hold of my weapons. The knife was in a raised position, which gave me great concern,"" he said. The officer said he then noticed Butt was wearing what looked like an improvised explosive device. ""They looked like vertical tubes, grey, around his chest. He was one to two metres away, a threat to me. Detonation would be fatal,"" he told the court. The officer said he was not aiming for a particular part of the body when he pulled the trigger. He fired a number of shots and stopped when the attacker fell to the ground. The court also heard from a second officer, identified as BX44, who told jurors that the incident at London Bridge was his first firearms incident. He said he had been tasked with handing out weapons from the Armed Response Vehicle, but that as he got out of the car, he saw three Asian men coming towards the group, carrying knives. He said he fired first at Butt because he thought he was about to kill BX46. ""The red dot [from the gun's sights] was on him but there was very little reaction and I was surprised he was still coming."" He said he continued to track him with his weapon, but he had to break away because he feared another of the attackers, Rachid Redouane, was about to kill another colleague, codenamed BX45. ""The red dot was on him. I fired shots and there was no immediate reaction. I carried on firing until I had to deal with the third threat of Youssef Zaghba. ""I was backing away trying to create a reactionary gap when I fired and fell backwards, and as I fell backwards I fired, and from the floor I fired through my legs up to his chest. ""I thought he was about to kill me."" Afterwards, he kicked Zaghba's hand away from his chest, because he assumed he was about to detonate what he thought was an explosive belt, before moving on to support BX46, he said. BX44 said he thought Butt was dead, but minutes after the first burst of gunfire he saw his chest rise and fall. ""I did not see his hands but his arms started to move down slowly towards the suicide vest,"" he said. ""I thought he was going to detonate. I fired shots. They were aimed shots."" BX44, who fired 17 shots, went on to help search for a fourth possible attacker and carried a woman who was having a seizure to safety. He said he found three people in a cupboard during a search of the Black and Blue restaurant nearby. The inquest continues.

"The firm built Poundsbridge Manor in 1593. Britain's oldest building firm, R Durtnell and Sons, has ceased trading, putting more than 100 jobs at risk. The company was founded in 1591, and has been run by 13 generations of the same family. It was working on a Â£22m project to refurbish parts of the Royal Pavilion Estate, when it failed. The firm, based in Brasted in Kent, started building in the time of Elizabeth I and built timber-framed houses. They started as carpenter-builders, who didn't build in brick or stone, but exclusively in wood. The business built Poundsbridge Manor in Kent in 1593. It is still standing, and is a short distance from Brasted. The timber-framed house was one of several built by family ancestor Bryan Darknal for Elizabethan merchants. The family remained as carpenter-builders until the 1800s, when Richard Durtnell bought a much larger premises. He set himself up as a general builder, and the business flourished. The last family member to run the firm was Alex Durtnell. The firm specialised in churches, private schools, art galleries and luxury houses. R Durtnell & Sons made a loss before tax of Â£679,877 in the year ended 31 December 2017, according todocuments submitted to Companies House,external. It said economic conditions had been ""very challenging"". The documents show it took a charge of Â£648,279 on the closure of its joinery business, which had been substantially cut during the recession. The firm had financial injection of Â£1.5m after cash flow difficulties in 2018. It also warned about competitive pressures and risks in contract tendering and management. One of the company's major projects was the refurbishment of the Brighton Dome Corn Exchange, which was originally built as the Prince Regent's stable block more than 200 years ago. Brighton & Hove City Council said it was ""committed"" to the project, which included renovating the Studio Theatre. ""The council has taken back the site and made it secure,"" it said. ""We are committed to completing the refurbishment of these unique buildings to protect their long-term future in the cultural heart of the city.""

"Researchers say an area the size of the US is available for planting trees around the world, and this could have a dramatic impact on climate change. Thestudy shows,externalthat the space available for trees is far greater than previously thought, and would reduce CO2 in the atmosphere by 25%. The authors say that this is the most effective climate change solution available to the world right now. But other researchers say the new study is ""too good to be true"". 'Football pitch' of Amazon forest lost every minute Tropical tree loss persists at high levels Climate change made heat five times more likely The ability of trees to soak up carbon dioxide has long made them a valuable weapon in the fight against rising temperatures. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) said that if the world wanted to limit the rise to 1.5C by 2050, an extra 1bn hectares (2.4bn acres) of trees would be needed. The problem has been that accurate estimates of just how many trees the world can support have been hard to come by. This new report aims to show not just how many trees can be grown, but where they could be planted and how much of an impact they would have on carbon emissions. A map showing only the potential for restoring forests and excluding desert, agricultural and urban areas The scientists from ETH-Zurich in Switzerland used a method called photo-interpretation to examine a global dataset of observations covering 78,000 forests. Using the mapping software of the Google Earth engine they were able to develop a predictive model to map the global potential for tree cover. They found that excluding existing trees, farmland and urban areas, the world could support an extra 0.9bn hectares (2.22bn acres) of tree cover. Once these trees matured they could pull down around 200 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide, some two-thirds of extra carbon from human activities put into the atmosphere since the industrial revolution. This is a quarter of the overall amount of CO2 in the air. ""Our study shows clearly that forest restoration is the best climate change solution available today and it provides hard evidence to justify investment,"" said Prof Tom Crowther, the senior author on the study. ""If we act now, this could cut carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by up to 25%, to levels last seen almost a century ago."" The researchers identify six countries where the bulk of the forest restoration could occur: Russia (151m hectares), US (103m), Canada (78m), Australia (58m), Brazil (50m) and China (40m). But they say speed is of the essence because as the world continues to warm then the potential area for planting trees in the tropics would be reduced. ""It will take decades for new forests to mature and achieve this potential,"" said Prof Crowther. ""It is vitally important that we protect the forests that exist today, pursue other climate solutions, and continue to phase out fossil fuels from our economies."" The new study has been welcomed by Christiana Figueres, former UN climate chief, who was instrumental in delivering the Paris climate agreement in 2015. ""Finally an authoritative assessment of how much land we can and should cover with trees without impinging on food production or living areas,"" she said in a statement. ""A hugely important blueprint for governments and private sector."" However not everyone was as effusive about the new study. Several researchers expressed reservations, taking issue with the idea that planting trees was the best climate solution available to the world right now. ""Restoration of trees may be 'among the most effective strategies', but it is very far indeed from 'the best climate change solution available,' and a long way behind reducing fossil fuel emissions to net zero,"" said Prof Myles Allen from the University of Oxford. Planting trees is important say some scientists but cutting emissions is paramount Others are critical of the estimates of carbon that could be stored if these trees were planted. ""The estimate that 900 million hectares restoration can store an addition 205 billion tonnes of carbon is too high and not supported by either previous studies or climate models,"" said Prof Simon Lewis from University College London. ""Planting trees to soak up two-thirds of the entire anthropogenic carbon burden to date sounds too good to be true.  Probably because it is,"" said Prof Martin Lukac from the University of Reading. ""This far, humans have enhanced forest cover on a large scale only by shrinking their population size (Russia), increasing productivity of industrial agriculture (the West) or by direct order of an autocratic government (China).  None of these activities look remotely feasible or sustainable at global scale."" The study has been published in the journal Science.

"This video can not be played JLR's boss calls for more charging points Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) is investing hundreds of millions of pounds to build a range of electric vehicles at its Castle Bromwich plant in Birmingham. Initially the plant will produce an electric version of the Jaguar XJ. JLR says the move will help secure the jobs of 2,700 workers at the plant. The news follows January's announcement, when the firm said it would cut 4,500 jobs, with the majority coming from the UK. That followed 1,500 jobs lost in 2018. JLR has not announced when it will launch the battery version of the XJ, but it will replace the petrol and diesel versions which have been made since 1968. The company's chief executive, Professor Ralph Speth, called on the government to put more effort into providing charging points for electric cars. ""The current charging infrastructure is not really sufficient to cover the country, nor the hotspots of the cities,"" he said in an interview with the BBC. ""The government has to govern the process,"" he added. Electric cars 'will not solve transport problem' 'Grave concern' as sales of low emission cars fall Why most people won't buy an electric car JLR's announcement comes a day after a report showed that in June sales of low emission cars had fallen for the first time in more than two years. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said efforts to sell such cars were being undermined by confusing policies and ""premature"" removal of subsidies. In response, the government said its focus on zero emission models had been a success, with registrations of battery electric vehicles up over 60% this year compared with the same period in 2018. According to another report, even if the nation switches to electric vehicles, car use will still need to be curbed. The Centre for Research into Energy Demand Solutions (CREDS) warned that electrifying cars will not address traffic jams, urban sprawl and wasted space for parking. This video can not be played Should I buy an electric car? The investment decision by JLR appears to contradict previous warnings by the firm that investment in the UK would be threatened by Brexit, and in particular a no-deal scenario. However, industry experts say that JLR could not wait to see the outcome of the Brexit, as it needed to update its range of vehicles. ""Given where it is in its product lifecycle it [JLR] has to make this decision. The capacity is at Castle Bromwich and there's research and development nearby as well, so they've basically run out of time on this decision,"" David Bailey, a professor of business economics at Birmingham Business School, told the BBC's Today programme. Car investment slumps on Brexit 'red alert' Jaguar Land Rover confirms 4,500 job cuts He added that without the new investment the Castle Bromwich plant would ""effectively be dead"". The plant also produces the Jaguar XF, XE and F-Type. Business Secretary Greg Clark said: ""Today's announcement is a vote of confidence in the UK automotive industry - protecting thousands of skilled jobs. ""It reflects our determination for the UK to be at the forefront of the development and manufacturing of the next generation of electric vehicles."" JLR is investing to produce an electric version of the XJ model Investment in the UK car industryfell 47% last year from 2017and the country is attracting a tiny fraction of the global investment in electric cars. VW alone is investing Â£70bn in Europe, the US and China. A no-deal Brexit would see new tariffs imposed on components and parts moving between the EU and the UK. Vauxhall's parent company said that without a deal it would not make the next generation Astra at Ellesmere Port.

"This video can not be played The BBC's John Sudworth meets Uighur parents in Turkey who say their children are missing in China China is deliberately separating Muslim children from their families, faith and language in its far western region of Xinjiang, according to new research. At the same time as hundreds of thousands of adults are being detained in giant camps, a rapid, large-scale campaign to build boarding schools is under way. Based on publicly available documents, and backed up by dozens of interviews with family members overseas, the BBC has gathered some of the most comprehensive evidence to date about what is happening to children in the region. Records show that in one township alone more than 400 children have lost not just one but both parents to some form of internment, either in the camps or in prison. Formal assessments are carried out to determine whether the children are in need of ""centralised care"". Alongside the efforts to transform the identity of Xinjiang's adults, the evidence points to a parallel campaign to systematically remove children from their roots. The Hotan Kindness Kindergarten, like many others, is a high security facility China's tight surveillance and control in Xinjiang, where foreign journalists are followed 24 hours a day, make it impossible to gather testimony there. But it can be found in Turkey. In a large hall in Istanbul, dozens of people queue to tell their stories, many of them clutching photographs of children, all now missing back home in Xinjiang. ""I don't know who is looking after them,"" one mother says, pointing to a picture of her three young daughters, ""there is no contact at all."" Another mother, holding a photo of three sons and a daughter, wipes away her tears. ""I heard that they've been taken to an orphanage,"" she says. In 60 separate interviews, in wave after wave of anxious, grief-ridden testimony, parents and other relatives give details of the disappearance in Xinjiang of more than 100 children. They are all Uighurs - members of Xinjiang's largest, predominantly Muslim ethnic group that has long had ties of language and faith to Turkey. Thousands have come to study or to do business, to visit family, or to escape China's birth control limits and the increasing religious repression. But over the past three years, they have found themselves trapped after China began detaining hundreds of thousands of Uighurs and other minorities in giant camps. China's hidden camps: The vanished Uighurs of Xinjiang 'I spent seven days of hell in Chinese camps' China's Muslim 'crackdown' explained The Chinese authorities say the Uighurs are being educated in ""vocational training centres"" in order to combat violent religious extremism. But evidence shows that many are being detained for simply expressing their faith - praying or wearing a veil - or for having overseas connections to places like Turkey. For these Uighurs, going back means almost certain detention. Phone contact has been severed - even speaking to relatives overseas is now too dangerous for those in Xinjiang. With his wife detained back home, one father tells me he fears some of his eight children may now be in the care of the Chinese state. ""I think they've been taken to child education camps,"" he says. New research commissioned by the BBC sheds light on what is really happening to these children and many thousands of others. Dr Adrian Zenz is a German researcher widely credited with exposing the full extent of China's mass detentions of adult Muslims in Xinjiang. Based on publicly available official documents, hisreport paints a picture of an unprecedented school expansion drive,externalin Xinjiang. Campuses have been enlarged, new dormitories built and capacity increased on a massive scale. Significantly, the state has been growing its ability to care full-time for large numbers of children at precisely the same time as it has been building the detention camps. And it appears to be targeted at precisely the same ethnic groups. In just one year, 2017, the total number of children enrolled in kindergartens in Xinjiang increased by more than half a million. And Uighur and other Muslim minority children, government figures show, made up more than 90% of that increase. As a result, Xinjiang's pre-school enrolment level has gone from below the national average to the highest in China by far. In the south of Xinjiang alone, an area with the highest concentration of Uighur populations, the authorities have spent an eye watering $1.2bn on the building and upgrading of kindergartens. Mr Zenz's analysis suggests that this construction boom has included the addition of large amounts of dormitory space. Xinhe County Youyi Kindergarten has space for 700 children, 80% of whom are from Xinjiang's minority groups Xinjiang's education expansion is driven, it appears, by the same ethos as underlies the mass incarceration of adults. And it is clearly affecting almost all Uighur and other minority children, whether their parents are in the camps or not. In 2018 work began on a site for two new boarding schools in Xinjiang's southern city of Yecheng (known as Kargilik in Uighur). Yecheng County Middle Schools 10 and 11 Dragging the slider reveals the pace of construction - the two middle schools, separated by a shared sports field, are each three times larger than the national average and were built in little more than a year. In April last year, the county authorities relocated 2,000 children from the surrounding villages into yet another giant boarding middle school, Yecheng County Number 4. Government propaganda extols the virtues of boarding schools as helping to ""maintain social stability and peace"" with the ""school taking the place of the parents."" And Mr Zenz suggests there is a deeper purpose. ""Boarding schools provide the ideal context for a sustained cultural re-engineering of minority societies,"" he argues. Just as with the camps, his research shows that there is now a concerted drive to all but eliminate the use of Uighur and other local languages from school premises. Individual school regulations outline strict, points-based punishments for both students and teachers if they speak anything other than Chinese while in school. And this aligns with other official statements claiming that Xinjiang has already achieved full Chinese language teaching in all of its schools. This video can not be played The BBC visits the camps where Chinaâs Muslims have their ""thoughts transformed"" Speaking to the BBC, Xu Guixiang, a senior official with Xinjiang's Propaganda Department, denies that the state is having to care for large numbers of children left parentless as a result. ""If all family members have been sent to vocational training then that family must have a severe problem,"" he says, laughing. ""I've never seen such a case."" But perhaps the most significant part of Mr Zenz's work is his evidence that shows that the children of detainees are indeed being channelled into the boarding school system in large numbers. Searching for truth in China's 're-education' camps Why is there tension between China and the Uighurs? China's Muslim camp spending 'revealed' There are the detailed forms used by local authorities to log the situations of children with parents in vocational training or in prison, and to determine whether they need centralised care. Mr Zenz found one government document that details various subsidies available to ""needy groups"", including those families where ""both a husband and a wife are in vocational training"". And a directive issued to education bureaus by the city of Kashgar that mandates them to look after the needs of students with parents in the camps as a matter of urgency. Schools should ""strengthen psychological counselling"", the directive says, and ""strengthen students' thought education"" - a phrase that finds echoes in the camps holding their parents. It is clear that the effect of the mass internments on children is now viewed as a significant societal issue, and that some effort is going into dealing with it, although it is not something the authorities are keen to publicise. This video can not be played The BBC has found new evidence of the increasing control and suppression of Islam in China Some of the relevant government documents appear to have been deliberately hidden from search engines by using obscure symbols in place of the term ""vocational training"". That said, in some instances the adult detention camps have kindergartens built close by, and, when visiting, Chinese state media reporters have extolled their virtues. These boarding schools, they say, allow minority children to learn ""better life habits"" and better personal hygiene than they would at home. Some children have begun referring to their teachers as ""mummy"". We telephoned a number of local Education Bureaus in Xinjiang to try to find out about the official policy in such cases. Most refused to speak to us, but some gave brief insights into the system. We asked one official what happens to the children of those parents who have been taken to the camps. ""They're in boarding schools,"" she replied. ""We provide accommodation, food and clothesâ¦ and we've been told by the senior level that we must look after them well."" Hotan Sunshine Kindergarten, seen through a wire fence In the hall in Istanbul, as the stories of broken families come tumbling out, there is raw despair and deep resentment too. ""Thousands of innocent children are being separated from their parents and we are giving our testimonies constantly,"" one mother tells me. ""Why does the world keep silent when knowing these facts?"" Back in Xinjiang, the research shows that all children now find themselves in schools that are secured with ""hard isolation closed management measures."" Many of the schools bristle with full-coverage surveillance systems, perimeter alarms and 10,000 Volt electric fences, with some school security spending surpassing that of the camps. The policy was issued in early 2017, at a time when the detentions began to be dramatically stepped up. Was the state, Mr Zenz wonders, seeking to pre-empt any possibility on the part of Uighur parents to forcibly recover their children? ""I think the evidence for systematically keeping parents and children apart is a clear indication that Xinjiang's government is attempting to raise a new generation cut off from original roots, religious beliefs and their own language,"" he tells me. ""I believe the evidence points to what we must call cultural genocide."" Searching for truth in China's 're-education' camps China's vanishing beards and mosques.

"This video can not be played Southern California earthquake wrecks homes and businesses Southern California was hit by its strongest earthquake in two decades on Thursday. The epicentre of the 6.4 magnitude tremor was near the city of Ridgecrest, which is about 150 miles (240 km) north-east of Los Angeles. Tremors continued to be felt on Friday, as emergency crews fought fires and provided medical assistance to people. The quake was felt from Las Vegas in Nevada to Los Angeles on California's Pacific coast. It hit at 10:33 local time (18:33GMT) on the US Fourth of July Independence Day holiday. On Friday morning at 04:15, a tremor measuring 5.4 struck. Los Angeles fire officials said there were no immediate reports of additional damage. There was significant damage in Ridgecrest, which lies south-west of the epicentre, local geophysicist Professor John Rundle told the BBC. The epicentre of the earthquake was near the city of Ridgecrest He added that it was fortunate the quake had happened far away from major population centres. Roads were cracked and broken and power lines fell to the ground after the earthquake, which also shattered glass and cracked the walls of some homes in the region. Fire burned some homes in the city of Ridgecrest The Ridgecrest Regional Hospital was evacuated, the Kern County Fire Department said. The service has responded to nearly two dozen incidents ranging from medical assistance for minor injuries to fires. The quake also struck near China Lake - the bomb testing facility of the US Navy, where weapons and aircraft are put to through their paces. One official from the facility told AFP news agency there was ""substantial damage"" â including fires, water leaks, and hazardous materials spills. Brad Alexander, a spokesman for California Governor's Office of Emergency Services, said on Thursday that fire engines and search and rescue teams were going to assist in the Ridgecrest area, where he believed there were a number of buildings on fire. ""This may not be over. There could be more earthquakes happening in the area and anyone listening that's in that region should be prepared to drop, cover and hold on,"" he warned. A man cleans up a supermarket that was damaged by the earthquake Governor of California Gavin Newsom declared an emergency for the areas affected, as concern for potential aftershocks ramped up. In interviews, he called on California residents to have a plan in place in case more earthquakes strike. Mayor of Ridgecrest Peggy Breeden said that some people had been struck by objects falling from buildings and gas lines had been broken. ""We are used to earthquakes but we're not used to this significance,"" she said. Los Angeles' early warning system did not send an advance alert to many residents in the region,the LA Times reports - because the forecast did not meet the threshold of severity for Los Angeles County,external. In the end, the shaking was worse than expected for some people. Stephen Sykes, who lives in Ridgecrest, was in the shower when his house started to shake. ""The whole house shook violently and we both ran out into the street. This went on for about 10 to 15 seconds, we were really scared,"" he told the BBC. ""Currently we are getting ready in case there's another one. We are moving items onto the floor and have turned off the gas supply. We will probably sleep outside tonight,"" he added.

"Sales of low emission cars in the UK have fallen for the first time in more than two years, the industry has said. The decline comes as overall sales of new cars continued to fall, dropping 4.9% in June from the year before. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said,externalthe fall in alternatively fuelled cars, such as hybrid electric vehicles, was ""a grave concern"". It said efforts to sell such cars were being undermined by confusing policies and ""premature"" removal of subsidies. The SMMT said sales of plug-in hybrid cars in June had halved since the same month a year earlier, while hybrid electric vehicle sales were down 4.7%. This meant that the alternatively fuelled car sector saw overall sales fall for the first time since April 2017. In last year's Budget, subsidies for plug-in hybrids were scrapped, and reduced for battery electric vehicles. How to get the best price when buying a car ""Another month of decline is worrying but the fact that sales of alternatively fuelled cars are going into reverse is a grave concern,"" said Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive. ""Manufacturers have invested billions to bring these vehicles to market but their efforts are now being undermined by confusing policies and the premature removal of purchase incentives. ""If we are to see widespread uptake of these vehicles, which are an essential part of a smooth transition to zero emission transport, we need world-class, long-term incentives and substantial investment in infrastructure."" A Department for Transport spokesperson said: ""The plug-in car grant has supported the purchase of 180,000 new cars with over Â£700m, including 100,000 plug-in hybrids, and the government is now focusing on the cleanest, zero emission models. ""That focus has paid off - with registrations of battery electric vehicles up over 60% this year compared to the same period in 2018."" Analysis by Tom Burridge, Transport Correspondent Driving-up sales of fully electric vehicles is the top priority for the Department for Transport, hence its decision to scrap grants for hybrids last year which will have contributed to the decline of hybrid sales. Privately officials admit that the charging infrastructure for electrics is not where it should be. The government says it is working with local authorities across the UK to address that. Charging points on streets with no off-street parking is a particular challenge. Another reason given for why sales of all low emission cars has not yet sky-rocketed in Britain is the up-until-now relatively low number of models on the market. That is set to change over the next year or so with plenty in the pipeline. And manufacturers have another reason to act. They could face fines if their new cars aren't green enough once European Union regulations kick-in in 2021. Much has been said of the government's target of no new diesels and petrols by 2040. But a more interesting question is: when will the tipping-point for electric sales arrive in Britain? Experts inside and outside of government talk about 2025. Norway has already reached its electric tipping point. High taxes for polluting vehicles and financial incentives for electrics mean for many there it's cheaper to buy and run an electric car. Getting, at least close, to price parity in Britain will also be key. Karen Johnson from Barclays Corporate Banking said that while the dip in overall car sales was ""no surprise"", the fall in alternatively fuelled vehicles ""will be more of a shock, and should make policymakers sit up and take note"". ""There are two main factors hitting new car sales. One is the broader economic environment that is affecting consumer and business confidence across the retail sector, with big-ticket items particularly affected. The other is the continuing confusion around fuel types and the impact of new regulation on the future value of vehicles,"" she said. ""People are having to guess what the next policy move will be and this is affecting the used car market, with some book values down in part due to fears about future prices if further regulatory changes are introduced. This has a knock-on effect on appetite for new vehicles.""

"The firm built Poundsbridge Manor in 1593. Britain's oldest building firm, R Durtnell and Sons, has ceased trading, putting more than 100 jobs at risk. The company was founded in 1591, and has been run by 13 generations of the same family. It was working on a Â£22m project to refurbish parts of the Royal Pavilion Estate, when it failed. The firm, based in Brasted in Kent, started building in the time of Elizabeth I and built timber-framed houses. They started as carpenter-builders, who didn't build in brick or stone, but exclusively in wood. The business built Poundsbridge Manor in Kent in 1593. It is still standing, and is a short distance from Brasted. The timber-framed house was one of several built by family ancestor Bryan Darknal for Elizabethan merchants. The family remained as carpenter-builders until the 1800s, when Richard Durtnell bought a much larger premises. He set himself up as a general builder, and the business flourished. The last family member to run the firm was Alex Durtnell. The firm specialised in churches, private schools, art galleries and luxury houses. R Durtnell & Sons made a loss before tax of Â£679,877 in the year ended 31 December 2017, according todocuments submitted to Companies House,external. It said economic conditions had been ""very challenging"".

"The oil tanker is suspected of carrying crude oil to Syria Royal Marines have boarded an oil tanker on its way to Syria thought to be breaching EU sanctions, the government of Gibraltar has said. Authorities said there was reason to believe the ship - Grace 1 - was carrying Iranian crude oil to the Baniyas Refinery in Syria. The refinery is subject to European Union sanctions against Syria. Britain's ambassador in Tehran, Robert Macaire, has been summoned over the incident. Iran's foreign ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi was quoted on Iranian state TV as saying the ambassador had been summoned over the ""illegal seizure"" of the tanker. Gibraltar's chief minister, Fabian Picardo, praised the marines who detained the ship. ""Be assured that Gibraltar remains safe, secure and committed to the international, rules-based, legal order,"" he said, thanking the police, customs and port authorities for their involvement in detaining the ship. The British overseas territory of Gibraltar stands at the gateway to the Mediterranean Gibraltar port and law enforcement agencies detained the super tanker and its cargo on Thursday morning with the help of the marines. The BBC has been told a team of about 30 marines, from 42 Commando, were flown from the UK to Gibraltar to help seize the tanker, at the request of the Gibraltar government. A defence source described it as a ""relatively benign operation"" without major incident. Mr Picardo said he had written to the presidents of the European Commission and European Council to give details of the sanctions that have been enforced. The Baniyas refinery, in the Syrian Mediterranean port town of Tartous, is a subsidiary of the General Corporation for Refining and Distribution of Petroleum Products, a section of the Syrian ministry of petroleum. The EU says,externalthe facility therefore provides financial support to the Syrian government, which is subject tosanctions,externalbecause of its repression of civilians since the start of the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad in 2011. The refinery has beensubject to EU sanctions since 2014,external. A spokesman for Prime Minister Theresa May said she welcomed the ""firm action"" by the Gibraltarian authorities.

"The firearms officer who shot dead the ringleader of the 2017 London Bridge attack thought he would be killed when he challenged him, a jury has heard. The officer told the Old Bailey inquest into the deaths of the attackers that he feared Khuram Butt would ""stab me, kill me and get hold of my weapons"". Butt and two other men had just driven at pedestrians on the bridge and attacked people with knives in Borough Market - killing eight and injuring 48. All three were shot dead by police. The inquest is expected to go on for three weeks and, under law, must be heard by a jury. In just 10 minutes, Khuram Butt, 27, Rachid Redouane, 30, and Youssef Zaghba, 22, ploughed down pedestrians on the bridge and brought chaos to Borough Market, carrying knives and wearing fake suicide belts. Addressing the court anonymously, the officer identified only as BX46 said that as he arrived at the scene in an armed response vehicle at the end of a 12-hour shift, he was armed with a Glock 17 pistol, a Taser and a G36 carbine rifle. He said he ""feared the worst"" when the call came in, and that as he approached with his window down, he could hear people saying ""they're stabbing people"". He said he then saw an Asian man in a blue Arsenal top holding a large knife in a threatening manner. Although he couldn't recall the exact words he used, he said he believed he would have shouted: ""Armed police, stand still, drop the knife"". Khuram Butt was finally shot dead in Stoney Street, bringing an end to the attack He said the attacker did not obey the command, so he moved back to create some space between them. But the attacker - later identified as Khuram Butt - came towards him, raising his knife. ""I believe his intention was to use the knife and stab me, kill me and get hold of my weapons. The knife was in a raised position, which gave me great concern,"" he said. The officer said he then noticed Butt was wearing what looked like an improvised explosive device. ""They looked like vertical tubes, grey, around his chest. He was one to two metres away, a threat to me. Detonation would be fatal,"" he told the court. The officer said he was not aiming for a particular part of the body when he pulled the trigger. He fired a number of shots and stopped when the attacker fell to the ground. The court also heard from a second officer, identified as BX44, who told jurors that the incident at London Bridge was his first firearms incident. He said he had been tasked with handing out weapons from the Armed Response Vehicle, but that as he got out of the car, he saw three Asian men coming towards the group, carrying knives. He said he fired first at Butt because he thought he was about to kill BX46. ""The red dot [from the gun's sights] was on him but there was very little reaction and I was surprised he was still coming."" He said he continued to track him with his weapon, but he had to break away because he feared another of the attackers, Rachid Redouane, was about to kill another colleague, codenamed BX45. ""The red dot was on him. I fired shots and there was no immediate reaction. I carried on firing until I had to deal with the third threat of Youssef Zaghba. ""I was backing away trying to create a reactionary gap when I fired and fell backwards, and as I fell backwards I fired, and from the floor I fired through my legs up to his chest. ""I thought he was about to kill me."" Afterwards, he kicked Zaghba's hand away from his chest, because he assumed he was about to detonate what he thought was an explosive belt, before moving on to support BX46, he said. BX44 said he thought Butt was dead, but minutes after the first burst of gunfire he saw his chest rise and fall. ""I did not see his hands but his arms started to move down slowly towards the suicide vest,"" he said. ""I thought he was going to detonate. I fired shots. They were aimed shots."" BX44, who fired 17 shots, went on to help search for a fourth possible attacker and carried a woman who was having a seizure to safety. He said he found three people in a cupboard during a search of the Black and Blue restaurant nearby. The inquest continues.

"Holleeder will face a full life term in jail Willem Holleeder, the Netherlands' most notorious gangster, has been found guilty of ordering a series of murders of figures in the world of organised crime. Holleeder, now 61, achieved notoriety in the 1980s for the kidnapping of beer tycoon Freddy Heineken. He then became a big crime boss and has been convicted after a lengthy and expensive trial in Amsterdam. Among his victims was friend and associate Cor van Hout. The judges convicted Holleeder of ordering five murders and one manslaughter and sentenced him to spend the rest of his life in jail. They also found that he had formed a crime gang and ordered ""cold-blooded"" killings with jailed associate Dino Soerel and since-murdered criminal Stanley Hillis. Why I betrayed my crime boss brother Dutch gangster plotted 'sister murders' The longest murder trial in Dutch history took place in a high-security Amsterdam court known as the ""bunker"". Holleeder's lawyers have said he will appeal. The prosecution case relied on the sensational testimony of his sister, Astrid, who made secret recordings of their conversations. Astrid Holleeder went into hiding when she revealed her betrayal. Van Hout was married to Holleeder's sister Sonja, and she too gave evidence against him. Willem Holleeder always insisted he was innocent and claimed his sisters' evidence was untrue. The judges ruled on Thursday that their evidence, along with testimony from ex-girlfriend Sandra den Hartog and others, was reliable and ""made an important contribution to proving that Holleeder had indeed committed"" the acts he was accused of. Astrid Holleeder, shown here with her niece in 1983, has gone into hiding ""Something had to happen to stop him,"" Astrid Holleeder told the BBC last year. Her story became a bestseller, but her decision to give evidence brought an end to her career as a defence lawyer and forced her to live in safe houses and wear elaborate disguises. ""I know he wants to kill me and I don't blame him for it. In a day there are many moments someone can be there and shoot you. It's always there. I really feel a Judas. I betrayed him."" Sam Klepper, criminal - shot dead, 2000 Cor van Hout, friend, brother-in-law and ex-accomplice - shot dead, 2003 Willem Endstra, property developer - shot dead, 2004 Kees Houtman, drug dealer Thomas van der Bijl, bar owner and family friend - shot dead, 2006 Also guilty of ordering 2002 attempted murder of John Mieremet, Klepper's business partner - later shot dead in Thailand, 2005 Also guilty of ordering manslaughter of Robert ter Haak, who died of bullet wounds in the murder of Cor van Hout. By BBC Hague correspondent Anna Holligan Applause erupted among the victims' families as the guilty verdict was read out. Holleeder was described in court as a man of many faces, unscrupulous with a high risk of reoffending. Once considered untouchable, the most notorious Dutch gangster will spend the rest of his life behind bars, thanks primarily to vital witness testimony provided by three women. His sisters and former partner risked their lives to collect and share incriminating evidence - including taped conversations - that proved Holleeder was guilty of killing rivals and former friends. Willem Holleeder (R) ordered the murder of his friend and brother-in-law Cor van Hout Nicknamed 'The Nose' on account of his most prominent feature, previous jail time didn't turn Holleeder into a public pariah. On the contrary, he was often called a ""cuddly criminal"", even appearing on a popular talk show and posing for selfies on the streets. As relatives celebrated, the man responsible for their suffering scowled. Holleeder still exerts influence within the criminal underworld, a number of the killings were ordered from his jail cell. The kidnapping of beer magnate Freddy Heineken at gunpoint in 1983 made international headlines, and the story was eventually turned into two films. The first, in Dutch, featured Rutger Hauer; the second, Kidnapping Mr Heineken, starred Anthony Hopkins. This video can not be played Willem Holleeder's criminal past has led to the making of a new film It was staged by a gang, including Holleeder and Van Hout, who held Heineken for three weeks before a ransom was paid. Holleeder eventually went to jail. However, Astrid Holleeder said her brother never learned from his crimes. ""As a mere villain, I'd still welcome him. But crimes of killing, that crosses a red line for me.""

"The UK foreign secretary has continued to warn China it could face ""serious consequences"" over its treatment of protesters in Hong Kong. Jeremy Hunt told the BBC he was keeping his options open over how the UK could respond, and refused to rule out sanctions. A group of activists occupied Hong Kong's parliament on Monday over a controversial extradition bill. China warned the UKnot to ""interfere in its domestic affairs"". Mr Hunt said he would not discuss any potential consequences ""because you don't want to provoke the very situation you are trying to avoid"". ""Of course you keep your options open,"" he added, insisting the UK would not just ""gulp and move on"" if China cracks down on protesters in the former British colony. Mr Hunt said he ""condemned all violence"" but warned the Chinese government not to respond to the protests ""by repression"". Why are the UK and China arguing about Hong Kong? The background you need on the Hong Kong protests Did Hong Kong violence sway public opinion? Hong Kong was a British colony for more than 150 years, but it was returned to China in 1997 after a treaty was signed by the two countries. The 1984 treaty guaranteed a level of economic autonomy and personal freedoms not permitted on the mainland. Demonstrators argue that a piece of legislation introduced by the city's pro-Beijing leader would make it easier to transfer people to face trial in China. Mr Hunt reiterated that China must honour Hong Kong's high level of autonomy from Beijing. ""The heart of people's concerns has been that very precious thing that Hong Kong has had, which is an independent judicial system,"" Mr Hunt toldRadio 4's Todayprogramme. ""The United Kingdom views this situation very, very seriously,"" he added. China's ambassador was summoned to the Foreign Office on Wednesday following ""unacceptable and inaccurate"" remarks. Liu Xiaoming said relations between China and the UK had been ""damaged"" by comments by Mr Hunt and others backing the demonstrators' actions. He said those who illegally occupied the Legislative Council building and raised the colonial-era British flag should be ""condemned as law breakers"". A protester covered a Hong Kong emblem with a British colonial flag in a government building on Monday He added that it was ""hypocritical"" of UK politicians to criticise the lack of democracy and civil rights in Hong Kong when, under British rule, there had been no elections nor right to protest. By James Landale, BBC diplomatic correspondent Britain's relations with China are at a low ebb. The question now is whether the damage is lasting. China appears determined to use the Hong Kong protests as an opportunity to push back against what it sees as Britain's illegitimate interference in its former colony. But equally Britain seems determined not to be bullied by China. Mr Hunt says the UK has every right to defend a treaty it signed with China in 1984 guaranteeing Hong Kong's freedoms and relative autonomy. The foreign secretary had no option but to summon the Chinese ambassador to London for a diplomatic dressing down. The danger is that this war of words infects the wider relationship and endangers Britain's strategic trading interest with China, something that will only become more important after Brexit. So Mr Hunt threatens ""serious consequences"" if China fails to honour the so-called Joint Declaration treaty. But he remains tight-lipped about what that might mean, not just because the UK has few diplomatic or economic cards it might wish to play, but also because he does not want to provoke a subsequent clash that might damage Sino-British relations even further. In response to accusations he had sided with the protesters, Mr Hunt said: ""I was not supporting the violence, what I was saying is the way to deal with that violence is not by repression."" ""It is by understanding the root causes of the concerns of the demonstrators - that freedoms that they have had for their whole life could be about to be undermined by this new extradition law,"" he added. Masked protesters stormed the Legislative Council building in Hong Kong on Monday Victor Gao, vice-president of the Centre for China and Globalisation in Beijing, called Monday's occupation of parliament ""anarchism"", adding ""this is to be protested and to be condemned by any government leader with any level of conscience"". Mr Gao urged the UK to condemn the violence. He said the ""crux of the matter"" was ""the UK no longer has a say in [how] Hong Kong should be run and managed"". In 1984, the Joint Declaration, signed by Margaret Thatcher and the then Chinese Premier Zhao Ziyang, set out how the rights of Hong Kong citizens should be protected in the territory's Basic Law under Chinese rule. Hong Kong has its own legal system, and rights such as freedom of assembly and free speech are protected Since 1997, Hong Kong has been run by China under the principle of ""one country, two systems"". Mr Hunt said: ""It is very important that the 'one country, two systems' approach is honoured."" The foreign secretary would not detail what consequences China might face if it did not honour the treaty, but said the UK had ""always defended the values we believe in"".

A protester covered a Hong Kong emblem with a British colonial flag in a government building on Monday He added that it was ""hypocritical"" of UK politicians to criticise the lack of democracy and civil rights in Hong Kong when, under British rule, there had been no elections nor right to protest. By James Landale, BBC diplomatic correspondent Britain's relations with China are at a low ebb. The question now is whether the damage is lasting. China appears determined to use the Hong Kong protests as an opportunity to push back against what it sees as Britain's illegitimate interference in its former colony. But equally Britain seems determined not to be bullied by China. Mr Hunt says the UK has every right to defend a treaty it signed with China in 1984 guaranteeing Hong Kong's freedoms and relative autonomy. The foreign secretary had no option but to summon the Chinese ambassador to London for a diplomatic dressing down. The danger is that this war of words infects the wider relationship and endangers Britain's strategic trading interest with China, something that will only become more important after Brexit. So Mr Hunt threatens ""serious consequences"" if China fails to honour the so-called Joint Declaration treaty. But he remains tight-lipped about what that might mean, not just because the UK has few diplomatic or economic cards it might wish to play, but also because he does not want to provoke a subsequent clash that might damage Sino-British relations even further. In response to accusations he had sided with the protesters, Mr Hunt said: ""I was not supporting the violence, what I was saying is the way to deal with that violence is not by repression."" ""It is by understanding the root causes of the concerns of the demonstrators - that freedoms that they have had for their whole life could be about to be undermined by this new extradition law,"" he added. Masked protesters stormed the Legislative Council building in Hong Kong on Monday Victor Gao, vice-president of the Centre for China and Globalisation in Beijing, called Monday's occupation of parliament ""anarchism"", adding ""this is to be protested and to be condemned by any government leader with any level of conscience"". Mr Gao urged the UK to condemn the violence. He said the ""crux of the matter"" was ""the UK no longer has a say in [how] Hong Kong should be run and managed"". In 1984, the Joint Declaration, signed by Margaret Thatcher and the then Chinese Premier Zhao Ziyang, set out how the rights of Hong Kong citizens should be protected in the territory's Basic Law under Chinese rule. Hong Kong has its own legal system, and rights such as freedom of assembly and free speech are protected Since 1997, Hong Kong has been run by China under the principle of ""one country, two systems"". Mr Hunt said: ""It is very important that the 'one country, two systems' approach is honoured."" The foreign secretary would not detail what consequences China might face if it did not honour the treaty, but said the UK had ""always defended the values we believe in"".

"Frank Lampard has returned to the club he spent 13 years with as a player Chelsea have appointed former midfielder Frank Lampard as their manager on a three-year deal. Lampard, 41, has left Championship side Derby County to take over at a club where he spent 13 years as a player. He succeeds Maurizio Sarri, wholeft Stamford Bridge in Juneto take charge of Italian champions Juventus. Lampard led Derby to the Championship play-off final, where they lost to Aston Villa, in his first season as a manager. The former England international made 648 Chelsea appearances, winning 11 major trophies with them. He takes over with Chelsea under a transfer embargo after the club were given atwo-window transfer banby world governing body Fifa - a decision they are appealing against at the Court of Arbitration for Sport. â¢Quiz: Can you name the managers Lampard has played under? Pat Nevin: 'I hope Chelsea return doesn't tarnish Lampard legend' Will Lampard risk pay off for Blues owner Abramovich? ""I am immensely proud to be returning to Chelsea as head coach,"" said Lampard. ""Everyone knows my love for this club and the history we have shared. However, my sole focus is on the job in hand and preparing for the season ahead. ""I am here to work hard, bring further success to the club and I cannot wait to get started."" The appointment comes nine days after Derby gave Lampard permission to talk to Chelsea and 18 days after Sarri left Stamford Bridge. Lampard is the 10th full-time manager appointed by Roman Abramovich since he bought the club in 2003. Chelsea director Marina Granovskaia said Lampard's Championship play-off final appearance with Derby demonstrated that he was ""one of the most talented young coaches in the game"". ""It gives us great pleasure to welcome Frank back to Chelsea as head coach,"" she said. ""Frank possesses fantastic knowledge and understanding of the club."" Derby assistant manager Jody Morris and first-team coach Chris Jones have also joined Lampard at Stamford Bridge, while former team-mate Petr Cech was appointed as technical advisor last month. Lampard's record at Derby Competition Games Won Drawn Lost Goals for Goals against Win % Championship (inc. play-offs) 49 21 14 14 74 59 42.9% League Cup 4 2 1 1 10 5 50% FA Cup 4 1 2 1 6 6 25% Total 57 24 17 16 90 70 42.1% Lampard joined Chelsea from boyhood club West Ham for a fee of Â£11m in 2001. He won a Champions League and a Europa League at the club, while also helping them to win three Premier League titles, four FA Cups and two League Cups. Chelsea's title win in 2004-05 was their first in half a century and Lampard scored 13 league goals that season, including both in a 2-0 victory at Bolton that sealed the top-flight crown. He scored 10 or more Premier League goals in 10 successive seasons for Chelsea and is the club's all-time record goalscorer with 211. Lampard left Stamford Bridge in June 2014 and had a stint at Manchester City, where he scored six goals in 32 appearances. He then joined New York City in Major League Soccer in the US, making his debut in August 2015, before ending his 21-year professional playing career in 2017. Lampard won 106 England caps after making his international debut in 1999 and went on to score 29 goals for the Three Lions. He appeared in three World Cups and one European Championships. The former midfielder said he did not want to be a ""clone"" of any of the club's previous managers despite ""rising expectations"" on and off the pitch. ""Expectations at Chelsea will always remain, because of what the club has done in the last 15 years and I like that, I enjoyed that as a player,"" he said. ""I enjoyed my first year on this side of the fence and I am determined to keep on going."" Christian Pulisic, a Â£58m signing from Borussia Dortmund, has replaced talisman Eden Hazard but Lampard will be forced to work with limited resources in his first season after the club was put under a transfer embargo. Chelsea have a plethora of players on loan at Premier League and Championship clubs, including Kurt Zouma at Everton and promotion-winning Tammy Abraham at Aston Villa, and many are expected to be recalled. Lampard also worked closely with two Chelsea players at Derby, both Mason Mount and Fikayo Tomori featuring heavily in his spell at Pride Park. ""There's a nice balance of the older and younger players,"" said Lampard. ""I'm excited about the current crop of youngsters, especially seeing the work that has gone into the academy over the years. ""I've seen the players - I worked with Mason Mount last year and you can see their attitude, how they hold themselves and their manners. ""I want to dangle the carrot and ask them can you perform? Can you get in the team?"" The new manager will have to succeed where his predecessor failed in giving sufficient game time to Callum Hudson-Odoi and Ruben Loftus-Cheek, two of Chelsea's most promising youngsters. Midfielder Loftus-Cheek has recently agreed a new five-year deal at his boyhood club, but Lampard will have to convince Hudson-Odoi to remain in west London despite ongoing interest from German giants Bayern Munich. Pat Nevin, former Chelsea player and BBC Sport pundit Is it disrespectful to question whether Frank is making the right decision by taking this job so early in his managerial career? If things go wrong at the start it can destroy your chances going forward. Just look at the stick Gary Neville took after his stint at Valencia went belly up. Sir Alex Ferguson was sacked from his first job at St Mirren - although he did bounce back quite well! Football is littered with the names of club legends who went back to manage at their spiritual homes. When it doesn't work out the dirty deed has to be done and for a while at least the legend is tarnished. I never want it to happen to Frank because I like and respect so much of what he has done and also the man he has turned out to be. Had he taken this job four or five years down the line, his chances of success would have been much better, but he knows there is no certainty the chance would come around again.

"Kim Kardashian-West has won $2.7m in damages after accusing Missguided USA of ripping off her outfits. She took the fashion brand to court in the US, claiming it was using her name to sell clothes and was ""notorious"" for ""knocking off"" designer items she wore. It didn't defend itself and was told to pay out $2.7m (about Â£2.1m). It has also been banned from using the reality star's ""trademarks in connection with the sale, marketing or distribution of its products"". Kim has spoken before about how, when she's pictured in a dress, almost-identical designs will appear on fast fashion sites within hours.

"Labour MP Kim Leadbeater says her bill includes ""the strictest safeguards anywhere in the world"" MPs have voted in favour of a bill to legalise assisted dying in England and Wales. The bill will face months of further scrutiny and votes in the Commons and Lords before the proposed changes could become law. At present, laws throughout the UK prevent people from asking for medical help to die. TheTerminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill,externalwas introduced by backbench Labour MP Kim Leadbeater. It proposes giving terminally ill people the right to choose to end their life. It says that anyone who wants to end their life must: be over 18 and live in England and Wales, and have been registered with a GP for at least 12 months have the mental capacity to make the choice and be deemed to have expressed a clear, settled and informed wish, free from coercion or pressure be expected to die within six months make two separate declarations, witnessed and signed, about their wish to die satisfy two independent doctors that they are eligible - with at least seven days between each assessment Under the proposals, a High Court judge would have to rule each time a person makes a request to end their life. A patient would then have to wait 14 days after the ruling, allowing them to have a period of reflection. A doctor would prepare the substance being used to end the patient's life, but the person would take it themselves. The bill defines the coordinating doctor as a registered medical practitioner with ""training, qualifications and experience"" at a level to be specified by the Health Secretary. It does not say which drug would be used. It would be illegal to use dishonesty, pressure or coerce someone into declaring they want to end their life, with a possible 14-year prison sentence. What is in the proposed assisted dying law? The historic vote saw 330 MPs vote in favour of allowing assisted dying and 275 against it. It followed five hours of passionate debate, during which MPs shared personal stories and those against the bill called for better end-of-life care. MPs were given a free vote on the issue, which meant they could make their own decision rather than follow party instructions. The government is impartial on the issue. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer was among those to vote in favour of the bill, as was Chancellor Rachel Reeves. However, Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner, Foreign Secretary David Lammy, Health Secretary Wes Streeting and Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood all voted against. Among the Conservatives, Rishi Sunak and Oliver Dowden, the former prime minister and deputy prime minister, were in a minority to support assisted dying. Kemi Badenoch, the new Conservative leader, voted against. When MPs last voted on the issue in 2015, they rejected different proposalsby 330 votes to 118,external. 'Hardest decision of my career': MPs wrestle with assisted dying choice Assisted dying: How did my MP vote? There are still many months of parliamentary activity ahead, but the bill now moves forward with the backing of the House of Commons. It means such a law has moved a step closer but it must still pass through five parliamentary stages handled by MPs and five more by peers, and further rounds of voting. MPs heard there would a period of up to two years before any new law was implemented because ""it is more important to get this right than to do it quickly"". It is also possible the bill could fall and not become law at all. What happens next to the bill on assisted dying? A separate bill is under discussion in Scotland. Liberal Democrat MSP Liam McArthurdrafted the Assisted Dying for Terminally Ill Adults (Scotland) Bill. If passed by MSPs, eligible applicants would have to: be resident in Scotland for at least 12 months be registered with a GP in Scotland be terminally ill have the mental capacity to make the request The bill is being considered by the health committee ahead of an initial vote by MSPs, which is not expected until 2025. In October 2024, Scottish Health Secretary Neil Gray saidthe proposed legislation went beyond the limits of Holyrood's powers, and was a matter for Westminster. However, McArthur said he was confident the UK and Scottish governments could find a solution if MSPs backed his bill. 'Northern Ireland is being left behind on assisted dying' Opponents warn that people could be put under pressure to end their lives and want improvements to palliative care instead. Paralympian and House of Lords crossbencher Baroness Grey-Thompson is a vocal critic. She told the BBC she is worried about ""the impact on vulnerable people, on disabled people, [the risk of] coercive control, and the ability of doctors to make a six-month diagnosis"". Lady Grey-Thompson is a long-standing critic of legalising assisted dying Actor and disability-rights activist Liz Carr, who madeBBC One documentary Better Off Dead?, also opposes changing the law. ""Some of us have very real fears based on our lived experience and based on what has happened in other countries where it's legal,"" she wrote on X. Dr Gordon Macdonald, from campaign group Care Not Killing, said: ""The safest law is the one we currently have. ""This bill is being rushed with indecent haste and ignores the deep-seated problems in the UK's broken and patchy palliative care system."" 'I might be dead before a decision is made': Terminally ill people on assisted dying Relief and fear ahead of assisted dying bill vote Kim Leadbeater, the MP who introduced the bill, said the law needs changing because some people ""have a horrible, harrowing death"", however good their end-of-life or palliative care is. She said her bill includes ""the strictest safeguards anywhere in the world"". Cancer patient Nathaniel Dye worked with Ms Leadbeater on her bill. He said it would allow people a death which was ""as kind and compassionate as possible"". The Dignity in Dying campaign group said the bill provides the ""most detailed, robust proposals"" on the issue that ""Westminster has ever considered"". According to chief executive Sarah Wootton, the fact that every year ""up to 650 terminally ill people end their own lives, often in lonely and traumatic ways,"" shows that the status quo is not working. Dame Esther Rantzen, who has stage four lung cancer, has joined Dignitas in Switzerland One of thehighest-profile advocates for change is broadcaster Dame Esther Rantzen, who has stage-four lung cancer. ""All I'm asking for is that we be given the dignity of choice,"" Dame Esther told BBC News. ""If I decide that my own life is not worth living, please may I ask for help to die?"" Both theBritish Medical Association,external, which represents doctors, and theRoyal College of Nursing,externalare neutral on the issue. Isle of Man Assisted Dying Bill to take next step Jersey votes to approve assisted dying plans for terminally ill There issome debate over exactly what the various terms mean,external. However,assisted dyinggenerally refers to a person who is terminally ill receiving lethal drugs from a medical practitioner, which they administer themselves. Assisted suicideis intentionally helping another person to end their life, including someone who is not terminally ill. That could involve providing lethal medication or helping them travel to another jurisdiction to die. Euthanasiais the act of deliberately ending a person's life to relieve suffering in which a lethal drug is administered by a physician. Patients may not be terminally ill. There are two types: voluntary euthanasia, where a patient consents; and non-voluntary, where they cannot because, for example, they are in a coma. The Dignity in Dying campaign group saysmore than 200 million people around the world have legal access to assisted dying,external. Switzerlandhas allowed assisted suicide since 1942. Its Dignitas facility - which accepts foreign patients as well as Swiss nationals. Between 1998 and 2023it helped 571 Britons to die,external. Assisted suicide is also legal inAustria. In theUS, 11 states - Oregon, California, New Mexico, Colorado, Washington, Hawaii, New Jersey, Vermont, Maine and Washington DC - allow ""physician-assisted dying"". It permits doctors to prescribe lethal drugs for self-administration. Voluntary euthanasia is legal inCanadawhere it is called medical assistance in dying. It can be provided by a doctor or nurse practitioner, either in person or through the prescription of drugs for self-administration. It is also legal inSpainandColombia, both of which also permit assisted suicide. Assisted dying is legal in some parts of Australia but the law differs across states. New Zealand'sEnd of Life Choice Act legalises assisted dying and allows adults in their final months of life to request assistance from a medical professional. Three countries have laws that allow people who are not terminally ill to receive assistance to die:The Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg. How does assisted dying work in other countries?

"The UK foreign secretary has continued to warn China it could face ""serious consequences"" over its treatment of protesters in Hong Kong. Jeremy Hunt told the BBC he was keeping his options open over how the UK could respond, and refused to rule out sanctions. A group of activists occupied Hong Kong's parliament on Monday over a controversial extradition bill. China warned the UKnot to ""interfere in its domestic affairs"". Mr Hunt said he would not discuss any potential consequences ""because you don't want to provoke the very situation you are trying to avoid"". ""Of course you keep your options open,"" he added, insisting the UK would not just ""gulp and move on"" if China cracks down on protesters in the former British colony. Mr Hunt said he ""condemned all violence"" but warned the Chinese government not to respond to the protests ""by repression"". Why are the UK and China arguing about Hong Kong? The background you need on the Hong Kong protests Did Hong Kong violence sway public opinion? Hong Kong was a British colony for more than 150 years, but it was returned to China in 1997 after a treaty was signed by the two countries. The 1984 treaty guaranteed a level of economic autonomy and personal freedoms not permitted on the mainland. Demonstrators argue that a piece of legislation introduced by the city's pro-Beijing leader would make it easier to transfer people to face trial in China. Mr Hunt reiterated that China must honour Hong Kong's high level of autonomy from Beijing. ""The heart of people's concerns has been that very precious thing that Hong Kong has had, which is an independent judicial system,"" Mr Hunt toldRadio 4's Todayprogramme. ""The United Kingdom views this situation very, very seriously,"" he added. China's ambassador was summoned to the Foreign Office on Wednesday following ""unacceptable and inaccurate"" remarks. Liu Xiaoming said relations between China and the UK had been ""damaged"" by comments by Mr Hunt and others backing the demonstrators' actions. He said those who illegally occupied the Legislative Council building and raised the colonial-era British flag should be ""condemned as law breakers"". A protester covered a Hong Kong emblem with a British colonial flag in a government building on Monday He added that it was ""hypocritical"" of UK politicians to criticise the lack of democracy and civil rights in Hong Kong when, under British rule, there had been no elections nor right to protest.

"The oil tanker is suspected of carrying crude oil to Syria Royal Marines have boarded an oil tanker on its way to Syria thought to be breaching EU sanctions, the government of Gibraltar has said. Authorities said there was reason to believe the ship - Grace 1 - was carrying Iranian crude oil to the Baniyas Refinery in Syria. The refinery is subject to European Union sanctions against Syria. Britain's ambassador in Tehran, Robert Macaire, has been summoned over the incident. Iran's foreign ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi was quoted on Iranian state TV as saying the ambassador had been summoned over the ""illegal seizure"" of the tanker. Gibraltar's chief minister, Fabian Picardo, praised the marines who detained the ship. ""Be assured that Gibraltar remains safe, secure and committed to the international, rules-based, legal order,"" he said, thanking the police, customs and port authorities for their involvement in detaining the ship. The British overseas territory of Gibraltar stands at the gateway to the Mediterranean Gibraltar port and law enforcement agencies detained the super tanker and its cargo on Thursday morning with the help of the marines.

"China has warned the UK not to ""interfere in its domestic affairs"" amid a growing diplomatic row over the recent protests in Hong Kong. Its UK ambassador said relations had been ""damaged"" by comments by Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt and others backing the demonstrators' actions. Liu Xiaoming said those who illegally occupied Hong Kong's parliament should be ""condemned as law breakers"". The ambassador was later summoned to the Foreign Office over the remarks. A Foreign Office spokesman said Sir Simon McDonald, permanent under secretary and head of the diplomatic service, told the ambassador his comments were ""unacceptable and inaccurate"". Earlier, Prime Minister Theresa May said she had raised concerns with Chinese leaders. Weeks of mass protests in the territory over a controversial extradition bill exploded on Monday, when a group of activists occupied the Legislative Council building for several hours after breaking away from a peaceful protest - raising the colonial-era British flag. Critics say the extradition bill could be used to send political dissidents from Hong Kong to the mainland. Demonstrators have also broadened their demands to include the release of all detained activists and investigations into alleged police violence. In the middle of the demonstrations, Mr Hunt pledged his ""unwavering"" support to the ex-British colony and its citizens' freedoms. Allow Twitter content?

In a series of broadcast interviews and posts on social media, Mr Hunt repeated the message that the protesters should refrain from violence, but urged China to listen to the concerns of the Hong Kong people. Did Hong Kong violence sway public opinion? What graffiti says about Hong Kong's evolving anger Hong Kong protests trample rule of law - China Beijing has made a formal complaint about Mr Hunt, accusing the Conservative leadership contender of ""colonial-era delusions"". But Mr Liu said he was ""disappointed"" by the UK's response. He said the countries' relationship was based on mutual respect and suggested there would be further ""problems"" if the UK did not recognise China's sovereignty over Hong Kong, its ""territorial integrity and principle of non-interference in domestic affairs"". He said it was ""hypocritical"" of UK politicians to criticise the lack of democracy and civil rights in Hong Kong when, under British rule, there had been no elections nor right to protest. The recent unrest, he added, was ""not about freedom but about breaking the law"". The background you need on the Hong Kong protests In response, Mr Hunt said good relations between countries were based on ""honouring the legally binding relationships between them"" - a reference to a 1984 treaty between the UK and China which paved the way for sovereignty over the territory to pass back to Beijing.

The Joint Declaration, signed by Margaret Thatcher and the then Chinese Premier Zhao Ziyang, set out how the rights of Hong Kong citizens should be protected in the territory's Basic Law under Chinese rule. Hong Kong has, since 1997, been run by China under a ""one country, two systems"" arrangement guaranteeing it a level of economic autonomy and personal freedoms not permitted on the mainland. The ambassador gave the British government both barrels at his press conference earlier. What's fascinating is there was no pretence, no attempt to gloss this over at all. This was visceral and system-wide. This is merely the British side of things, the same message is coming from Beijing and Hong Kong too. There is definite push-back from the whole Chinese machine. The British are so infuriated that they've summoned the ambassador almost immediately to give him a dressing down. What was a war of words now risks becoming a substantial issue between the two countries. The Foreign Office has said it continues to make it clear to the Chinese government, both in public and private, that the rights of Hong Kong residents must be fully respected. Speaking on Wednesday, Theresa May said she had raised her concerns directly with Chinese leaders at the recent G20 meeting. ""It is vital that Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy and the rights and freedoms set down in the Sino-British joint declaration are respected,"" she told MPs. Successive UK governments have heralded a ""golden era"" in economic relations with China, with growing levels of trade and foreign investment. But critics say this has come at the expense of turning a blind eye to human rights violations in China and Beijing's increasing economic nationalism.

"The oil tanker is suspected of carrying crude oil to Syria Royal Marines have boarded an oil tanker on its way to Syria thought to be breaching EU sanctions, the government of Gibraltar has said. Authorities said there was reason to believe the ship - Grace 1 - was carrying Iranian crude oil to the Baniyas Refinery in Syria. The refinery is subject to European Union sanctions against Syria. Britain's ambassador in Tehran, Robert Macaire, has been summoned over the incident. Iran's foreign ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi was quoted on Iranian state TV as saying the ambassador had been summoned over the ""illegal seizure"" of the tanker. Gibraltar's chief minister, Fabian Picardo, praised the marines who detained the ship.

"The National Trust has announced that it will sell off the shares it holds in fossil fuel companies. At present, 4% of its Â£1bn stock market investment is in such firms. The Trust, the biggest conservation charity in Europe, said it wanted to invest in green start-ups and portfolios that benefited nature and the environment. It said it had set a three-year timescale for the change, but most shares would be sold within a year. Until now, the Trust had been prepared to invest in firms that derived less than 10% of their turnover from the extraction of thermal coal or the production of oil from tar sands. That same threshold was also adopted bythe Church of England in 2015. A year ago, however, the Church's General Synod voted to withdraw investment from companies that do not meet the terms of the Paris climate agreement by 2023. And last month, the Norwegian parliament approved plans for the country's sovereign wealth fund, which manages $1tn (Â£786bn) of the country's assets, to sell coal and oil investments worth $13bn and invest in renewable energy projects instead. Norway's $1 trillion fund to cut oil shares UK fund giant warns on climate catastrophe ""Over the years, we've gradually evolved our investment strategy to reduce our carbon footprint,"" said the Trust's chief financial officer, Peter Vermeulen. Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, he added: ""As a conservation charity [we] believe that after decades' worth of lobbying not enough has been done by the oil and gas companies, and for that reason we're looking to withdraw our investment and invest in companies that are looking to deliver environmental benefits as well as financial returns."" He acknowledged that oil giants such as BP and Shell were investing in renewable energy, but said that while their investments were ""not insignificant"", they were ""too small as a proportion of their total capital investment"". ""Still less than 10% of the oil major's investment is on low-carbon technologies and we believe that's not sufficient,"" he said. Plea over Scottish Parliament's fossil fuel investments Northern Ireland council urges end to fossil fuel investments The Trust said it analysed the carbon footprint of its investment portfolio every six months. It said it also required all its investment managers to be signatories of the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment.
