"This video can not be played Watch as Syrian government forces enter town of Ain Issa The US has imposed sanctions on Turkish ministries and senior government officials in response to the country's military offensive in northern Syria. President Donald Trump also phoned his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan to demand an immediate truce, Vice-President Mike Pence said. Mr Pence said he would travel to the region ""as quickly as possible"". The move comes after criticism of a US troop withdrawal from the region which some say gave Turkey a ""green light"". The Turkish offensive, which began last week, aims to push the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) from the border region. Turkey considers the biggest militia in the SDF a terrorist organisation. The Turkish government wants to create a ""safe zone"" in the area, where it can resettle up to two million Syrian refugees currently in Turkey. Many of them are not Kurds and critics warn this could lead to ethnic cleansing of the local Kurdish population. Dozens of civilians have been killed in the operation so far and at least 160,000 have fled the area, according to the UN. A Kurdish Syrian woman cries during the funeral of five Syrian Democratic Forces fighters in Ras al-Ain Some aid organisations have been forced to suspend operations and evacuate international staff over security fears. Bowen: Trump's Pullback reshapes war UK government Turkish halts arms exports The people caught in the middle in northern Syria Offensive explained in four maps Kurdish-led forces have been a key ally of the US in the fight against the Islamic State (IS) group in Syria. They described the US withdrawal, which preceded Turkish action, as a ""stab in the back"". There are fears the destabilisation could risk a resurgence of IS, as thousands of former fighters and their relatives are being detained in northern Syria. Hundreds of IS family members are said to have already escaped from one camp. Facing immense pressure, Kurdish-led forces on Sunday announced a deal with the Syrian government for military support to help repel Turkey. US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced the measures alongside Vice-President Pence in Washington DC on Monday evening. Action was taken against Turkey's defence and energy ministries,external, as well as the ministers of defence, energy and interior, the US Treasury said. The move freezes their assets in the US and bans transactions with them that involve the US financial system. ""The Turkish government's actions are endangering innocent civilians, and destabilizing the region, including undermining the campaign to defeat ISIS [Islamic State],"" the statement added. President Donald Trump has faced mounting pressure to take action against Turkey - a Nato partner - including from Republicans usually loyal to his administration. In a statement posted on Twitter, President Trump also said he would raise tariffs on Turkish steel back to 50% and ""immediately stop"" negotiations related to a ""$100 billion trade deal"" with Turkey. ""The United States and our partners have liberated 100 percent of ISIS's ruthless territorial caliphate,"" the statement said. ""Turkey must not put these gains in jeopardy."" Vice-President Pence warned that the sanctions would worsen ""unless and until Turkey embraces an immediate ceasefire"" and negotiates a long-term settlement on the border. The vice-president also reiterated that the US ""did not give a green light to Turkey to invade Syria"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who leads the Democrats, said on Twitter that the sanctions fell ""very short of reversing the humanitarian disaster brought about by [the president's] own erratic decision-making"". Earlier on Monday, European Union countries committed to suspending arms exports to Turkey but stopped short of an EU-wide arms embargo. In response, Turkey said it would examine its co-operation with the EU due to its ""unlawful and biased"" attitude. Analysis by Mark Lowen, former BBC Turkey correspondent Donald Trump is now sanctioning Turkey for an invasion that he is widely considered to have enabled. By announcing a withdrawal of US troops from northern Syria, President Erdogan was given a de facto green light to move in. The sanctions might appear hefty, targeting senior ministers and hiking steel tariffs. But in reality, they are lighter than expected - and we have been here before. In August 2018, Donald Trump lost patience with Turkey's imprisonment of an American pastor, sanctioning two ministers and imposing 50% tariffs on Turkish aluminium and steel. The Turkish lira plunged to a record low of 7.2 to the dollar. Since then, the lira has somewhat recovered - and appears to have largely shaken off today's measures. The US represents just 5% of Turkey's steel export market. President Erdogan tends to dig in his heels when he feels under pressure. There is no sign of any change of tack by him - yet. Following the deal with Kurdish-led forces, the Syrian army began to move towards the border on Monday. Syrian state media said government forces had entered the strategic town of Manbij, inside the area where Turkey wants to create its ""safe zone"". Turkish troops and pro-Turkish, anti-government fighters were gathering near the town. The deal was seen as a boost for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad as it meant his troops would return to north-eastern areas for the first time since 2012, when their withdrawal to fight rebels elsewhere allowed Kurdish militias to take control. This video can not be played The BBC's Martin Patience explains what's behind the conflict Despite disagreeing with their attempts at self-rule, Mr Assad did not seek to retake the territory, especially after the Kurds became partners in the coalition against IS with US troops on the ground. Apart from fighting IS, the Kurds were fundamental to the US in limiting the influence of rivals Russia and Iran and keeping some leverage on the ground. For now, Syrian forces will not be deployed between Tal Abyad and Ras al-Ain, where Turkey has focused its efforts. The Russian government, a key Syrian ally, said it did not want to entertain the possibility of a clash between Russian and Turkish forces in Syria, and said it was in regular contact with Turkey's authorities. Will Islamic State re-emerge? Orphaned siblings rescued from Syrian camp Turkey v Syria's Kurds explained Your questions answered 'We have no friends but the mountains' President Erdogan insists the operation will continue until Turkey's ""objectives have been achieved"" despite the involvement of Syrian government forces. ""God willing, we will quickly secure the region stretching from Manbij to our border with Iraq and ensure that, in the first stage, one million, and then two million Syrian refugees return to their homes on their own free will,"" he said in a televised speech on Tuesday. The United Nations say 160,000 have fled their homes but the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) say this number could be as high as 250,000 with 70 civilian deaths reported. The UK-based monitoring group say 135 members of the SDF have died in the military operation so far along with 122 pro-Turkish fighters and eight Turkish soldiers. Turkey's Anadolu news agency report 18 civilians have been killed over the border in southern Turkey. On Tuesday the UN Human Rights office called on Turkey to investigate suspected war crimes being carried out by pro-Turkish forces. ""Turkey could be deemed as a state responsible for violations by their affiliated groups as long as Turkey exercises effective control of these groups or the operations in the course of which those violations occurred,"" spokesman Rupert Colville said. The warning came after footage emerged over the weekend that appeared to show summary executions of Kurds, including female politician Hevrin Khalaf.

"Sports Direct owner Mike Ashley's grievance against Adidas' supply power dates back to 2013 Mike Ashley's Sports Direct has called for an investigation into the sportswear industry, complaining about the dominance of Adidas and Nike. The firm said the ""must-have"" brands hold a bargaining position which allows them to control both the supply and the price of their products. Adidas has blocked the company from selling some of its products,Sports Direct said in a statement,external. It follows reports that Nike is ending supply deals with several retailers. ""Sports Direct believes that the industry as a whole would benefit from a wide market review by the appropriate authorities in both the UK and Europe,"" it said in a statement. ""The sports industry has long been dominated by the must-have brands such as Adidas. These must have brands hold an extremely strong bargaining position vis-Ã -vis the retailers within their supply networks and use their market power to implement market wide practices aimed at controlling the supply and, ultimately, the pricing of their products,"" Sports Direct said. Mr Ashley's grievance stretches as far back as 2013 when the German giant withdrew replica Chelsea shirts from Sports Direct stores. The retailer said the dominance of Nike and Adidas allows them to ""[refuse] to supply key products... with no apparent justification"". The Sunday Times disclosed that Nike,externalhad told several independent retailers it will pull its products from their stores. It is part of a move by the US giant to reduce the number of retailers it uses and push customers towards its website, the newspaper said. ""All those companies that built a business on the back of Nike and Adidas are toast - there's no way they can replace that [business],"" a source told the Sunday Times. Last month, Sports Direct complained that its rival JD Sports' planned Â£90m takeover of Footasylum could reduce Mr Ashley's access to the top brands. In the past, Adidas and Nike have preferred to work with JD Sports but Sports Direct has attempted to make inroads, appointing former Nike executive David Daly as chairman of its board. ""Sports Direct has consistently aimed to provide the widest range of products at attractive prices and will continue to work constructively with all its suppliers to enhance its product offering for the benefit of consumers,"" the company said. A Nike spokesperson said: ""Nike continually evaluates the marketplace and competitive landscape to understand how we can best serve consumers. As part of this, from time to time we do make adjustments to our sales channels, in order to optimize distribution."" Adidas has yet to respond to a BBC request for comment.

"This video can not be played PC Andrew Harper's coffin was draped in a police flag The widow of a police officer killed on duty said he was ""gentle giant with a heart of gold"" as she addressed hundreds of people at his funeral. Uniformed colleagues of PC Andrew Harper lined the route as the cortege made its way to the private service at Christ Church Cathedral in Oxford. The 28-year-old died after being dragged under a vehicle on a road near Sulhamstead, Berkshire, on 15 August. His widow Lissie Harper said he ""wore his uniform with pride"". Reading the eulogy, she said: ""You used to tell me we were a team and that we would get through all of life's hurdles together, how I wish you were here with me now. The hardest challenge of all is losing you. ""Keeping everyone safe was your priority, not only in your job but with your family too. Everything was always okay when you were around. ""Although Andrew was strong he was also unfailingly kind, a gentle giant with a heart of gold."" The couple, who were childhood sweethearts and had been together for 13 years, had only been married for four weeks. She added: ""He was my hero and his spirit will live on in my memories forever."" PC Andrew Harper had married his wife Lissie four weeks before his death Earlier members of the public paid their respects as the cortege led by mounted officers travelled through Oxford before the service, which was attended by 800 mourners. The coffin was draped in a navy flag with a police crest on the side and was carried into the cathedral at 11:00 BST by six officers. Leading the service, the Dean of Christ Church the Very Rev Dr Martyn Percy said: ""The tributes that have poured in for Andrew exemplify a truly outstanding young man, but also the very best virtues in policing. ""He represented policing at its best. He was everything you wanted in a police officer. Authentic, brave, genuine, and kind."" Lissie Harper left a symbol of her husband's life during the service Mrs Harper placed her husband's police hat on his coffin, while members of PC Harper's family also laid symbols of his life in front of a large photograph of him inside the cathedral. Songs by Shirley Bassey and Russell Watson were played during the service, in addition to performances from the cathedral's choir. Colleague PC Jordan Johnstone paid tribute to his ""infectious smile and relentless humour"". ""I'm privileged to have worked with you and even more so to call you my friend,"" he added. By BBC News correspondent Helena Wilkinson in Oxford Officers lined the streets as the cortege travelled through Oxford PC Harper had married his childhood sweetheart Lissie just 28 days before he died. Today she, with other family and friends, came to Christ Church Cathedral to say their final goodbye. People who didn't know him came out to pay their respects. Hundreds of officers from PC Harper's force also lined the route. Many looked as young as he was. As the hearse led by officers on horseback passed, silence fell. Officers bowed their heads. Some people in the crowds began to cry. Through the glass of the hearse PC Harper's coffin could be seen draped in a Thames Valley Police flag. A young officer who died while doing his job. A hero to so many. PC Harper, from Wallingford in Oxfordshire, was killed on the A4 Bath Road while investigating a reported break-in. Thames Valley Police Federation chairman Craig O'Leary said PC Harper was ""a hero"" who ""loved being a police officer"". Thousands of bikers to ride in memory of killed PC PC's death inspires kindness from public Three teens charged with PC's murder The force said its flags would be flying at half-mast as a mark of respect to the officer. It added on Twitter: ""Today is going to be a tough day for all our officers, staff and volunteers as we pay tribute to our fallen colleague."" Lissie Harper placed her husband's police hat on his coffin Three teenagers remain in custody charged with murdering PC Harper. Henry Long, 18, from Mortimer in Reading, and two 17-year-old boys, who cannot be named because of their age, are accused of murder and conspiracy to steal a quad bike. Thomas King, 21, from Basingstoke, is also accused of conspiracy to steal a quad bike. Jed Foster was also accused of murderbut prosecutors dropped his charges following further police investigation. PC Andrew Harper's order of service Today I would like to remember and honour the kind brave and lovely man we all know. We are all here just for you. From the ever sweet, lanky, red faced boy passing me notes in class, to the strong and loyal man you grew to be. I have always known how special you are. We often talked about how lucky we were to have found and kept each other, true childhood sweethearts, loving one another more and more with each passing day. Not a day went past that we didn't say I love you. You used to tell me we were a team and that we would get through all of life's hurdles together, how I wish you were here with me now. The hardest challenge of all is losing you. We managed to pack so many amazing memories into the last 13 years, travelling the world, buying a house and getting married. You had a contagious love for life, filling each day with laughter and appreciating all the little things. You have always been a protector. Whether in your role of big brother, fierce friend, loving husband or keeper of peace among the public, keeping everyone safe was your priority, not only in your job but your family too. Everything was always okay when you were around. Although Andrew was strong he was also unfailingly kind, a gentle giant with a heart of gold. He wore his uniform with pride and vowed to challenge the bad and celebrate the good. He loved to be part of a team and had a work ethic to admire. Looking around me today I know that he was classed so very highly among his peers, known for being proactive, kind and fair.

"This video can not be played What did we learn from the Queen's Speech? The BBC's Helen Catt explains Boris Johnson's government has set out ""ambitious"" policies on crime, health, the environment and Brexit in a Queen's Speech that opposition parties have dismissed as an ""election manifesto"". Plans for tougher sentences for violent offenders and legal targets for cutting plastic pollution are among 26 bills set out at Parliament's State Opening. The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg said it was a ""long shopping list"". But with the PM having no majority, many of the bills may not become law. Our political editor said the PM was keen to focus on ""bread and butter issues"" like investment in schools and the NHS, or coming up with, at long last, a new way of funding care for the elderly. But she said there was no guarantee the legislative programme would be approved by Parliament. If MPs reject it, it will trigger renewed calls for a general election. During a debate in the Commons later on Monday, Mr Johnson said his plans offered ""a new age of opportunity for the whole country"". But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the speech was ""a propaganda exercise"", adding: ""The prime minister promised that this Queen's Speech would dazzle us. On closer inspection, it is nothing more than fool's gold."" MPs will be able to debate the Queen's speech for a further five days, with a different theme for each of them, including the NHS and the economy. All the pomp - but very bizarre circumstances Bill by bill - what does Boris Johnson want to do? Robes, tiaras and fanfare: Inside the Queen's Speech Why didn't the Queen wear her crown? Despite continuing Brexit uncertainty, the government has said it is determined to press ahead with its plans, announcing its intention tohold a Budget on 6 November. Negotiations over the UK's departure,with Mr Johnson trying to secure an agreement that will enable the country to leave by 31 October. The government says if it can strike a deal with the EU, it will introduce a withdrawal agreement bill and aim to secure its passage through Parliament before the Halloween deadline. This video can not be played Queen outlines government's Brexit plan The origins of the current State Opening date back to the 1850s The prime minister's partner, Carrie Symonds, was among those watching Labour described the Queen's Speech as a ""party political broadcast"" This video can not be played A look at the fanfare and formality behind this year's State Opening of Parliament The Queen's Speech is famous for its pageantry - with the monarch arriving at the Palace of Westminster in a carriage procession and delivering her speech from the throne in the House of Lords, flanked by the Prince of Wales. Mr Johnson said his government was focused on ""seizing the opportunities that Brexit present"". The 26 bills include,external: Seven pieces of Brexit-related legislation, including measures to establish new regulatory frameworks for fishing, farming, trade and financial services, and a bill to end freedom of movement and bring in a points-based immigration system from 2021. Seven criminal justice bills, including measures that will increase sentences for about 3,000 serious or violent criminals by ending automatic release at the half-way point, tougher penalties for foreign national offenders who try to return to the UK after being deported, and greater protection for police officers. Domestic violence legislation will also be carried over from the last session. Plans for an independent NHS investigations body with legal powers - the Health Service Safety Investigations Body (HSSIB) - to look into ""serious healthcare incidents"", and a pledge to update the Mental Health Act to reduce the number of detentions. An environment bill to ""enshrine principles in law"" and set legally binding ""improvement targets"" to reduce plastics, cut air pollution, restore biodiversity and improve water quality. A separate animal welfare bill to outlaw trophy hunting. Proposed reforms to the divorce laws to minimise the impact of family breakdown on children, and changes in employment law to require restaurants and cafes to give waiting staff ""all tips"" owed to them. There is also a commitment to reform adult social care in England, although no legislation planned at this stage. New measures will also be brought forward to tackle electoral fraud, including requiring people to show an approved form of ID before voting in general and local elections. A shake-up of the rail franchising system in England is also being proposed to improve service reliability, reduce ""fragmentation"" and introduce a ""greater distance"" between ministers and the day-to-day running of the network. Law and order - what has the PM promised? Could there be an early general election? Mr Johnson said the programme, which includes four bills carried over from the last session, demonstrated Brexit was not the limit of the government's ambitions. He told the Commons: ""At the heart of this speech is an ambitious programme to unite this country with energy, optimism and with the basic common sense of one-nation Conservatism."" But Mr Corbyn criticised a number of the proposals, saying mental health care was ""getting worse and worse"", social care proposals ""offered the same promise after two years of inaction and failure"", and plans for education were ""shockingly weak"". He told MPs: ""There has never been such a farce of a government with a majority of minus 45 and a 100% record of defeat in the House of Commons, setting out a legislative agenda they know cannot be delivered in this Parliament."" Brexit talks continue ahead of crunch summit What is Boris Johnson's Brexit plan? Could no-deal still happen? The SNP's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, focused his criticism on the PM's plans for Brexit, saying the UK had ""entered very dark days"". He said the EU was ""the greatest example of political co-operation and peace - leaving behind the scars of war, the pain of loss, and instead choosing to take the hand of friendship across this continent"" and to leave would be a ""tragedy"". Former Tory cabinet minister Dominic Grieve, who now sits as an independent after rebelling over Brexit, said the PM would find it ""very difficult"" to govern until Brexit was resolved. That was a very long shopping list of things, but the unsaid reality, of course, is that the biggest question hanging over it all is Brexit. The Queen may have said the government's priority is to leave on 31 October, but there's no way anyone in this square mile can be sure that happens. Whether it happens - and how it happens - is a much bigger influence than anything we've just heard being said. In many ways, it's a Queen's Speech from a parallel universe - one in which Boris Johnson gets his way. Where he definitely gets his deal with Brussels by the end of this week, he definitely gets it through Parliament on Saturday and definitely gets all the Brexit legislation passed. It's also a world in which he definitely gets the general election he wants in the next few weeks and then definitely gets a Conservative majority. We shouldn't dismiss this speech - it does mean something, but what it means is this is what we are likely to see as the basis for a Conservative manifesto whenever that election does come.

"King Charles has delivered the Labour government's first King's Speech in the House of Lords. Part of the State Opening of Parliament ceremony, the speech marks the start of the parliamentary year. The King's Speech set out the new Labour government's priorities for the months ahead, following the party's general election victory. Formally called the Speech from the Throne, Charles gavehis first King's Speech in November 2023. He also delivered the Queen's Speech on behalf of his mother, the late Queen Elizabeth, in May 2022. The quirks and crowns of the King's State Opening The speech is written by the government, and the monarch delivers it in a neutral tone, to avoid any appearance of political support. Its length depends on the number of proposed laws and other announcements - such as foreign policy objectives - but it normally lasts about 10 minutes. The 2024 Kings Speech outlined the draft laws which Labour plan to introduce in the coming months. These include bills on workers' rights, the renationalisation of the railways, illegal immigration, housing and planning and House of Lords reform. Key points in King's Speech at a glance Traditionally, the State Opening begins with a procession in which the King travels from Buckingham Palace to Westminster by carriage. On arrival, he uses the Sovereign's Entrance, reserved for the monarch. The King then processes to the throne in the House of Lords. MPs are summoned to the Lords by Black Rod,an official position currently held by Sarah Clarke,external. Before entering the House of Commons, Black Rod has the door shut in their face. They then have to knock three times on the door with the rod to gain entry before it is opened, and MPs follow Black Rod back to the House of Lords to hear the speech. MPs, peers and other dignitaries generally listen in silence. Traditionally, the government MP holding the position ofvice-chamberlain of the household,external- currently Samantha Dixon - is ""held hostage"" in Buckingham Palace while the King is in Parliament, to ensure the monarch's safe return. Who is Black Rod and what do they do in Parliament? What does the King do? Yes. About two hours after the speech is delivered, MPs reassemble in the House of Commons to begin debating its contents. After introductory speeches by two MPs, the prime minister will ""sell"" the speech to the Commons, setting out a vision for the country. The leader of the opposition then gets the chance to respond, before other MPs are allowed to contribute. The last prime minister to lose a vote on the speech was Stanley Baldwin in 1924 The debate on what is known as ""the Humble Address"" normally lasts about five days. At the end of the debate there is a vote. It is normally seen as symbolic, as it is extremely rare for a government to lose it. The last time this happened was in January 1924, under Conservative Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin. Mr Baldwin proceeded with a King's Speech - George V was the monarch at the time - despite having lost his majority in the previous month's general election. He was forced to resign, and Labour formed a short-lived government. The speech outlined21 laws that ministers had intended to pass in the 2023 Parliamentary session. They included plans to boost investment in transport, laws to stop people smoking, and tougher sentences for serious offenders. However, when former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced the 4 July general election, the government was forced to abandon many of its planned bills.

"Thousands of council workers staged a strike over the dispute Thousands of women who fought Glasgow City Council for equal pay have had money deducted to pay legal fees, despite pledges from their unions. Members of Unison, Unite and the GMB were told they would get 100% of the settlement money offered. ButBBC Disclosurehas seen legal documents showing ""all claimants"" have had fees ""deducted"". The long-running dispute over women being paid less than men in jobs of the same grade was settled in January. Glasgow City Council agreed to pay out a reported Â£548m to compensate the women for the money they should have been paid, in many cases going back to 2006 when the new job evaluation scheme was adopted. The scheme was supposed to ensure that men and women received equal pay for jobs of the same value. But instead, some traditionally female-dominated roles such as catering or home care ended up being paid up to Â£3 an hour less than male-dominated jobs such as bin lorry workers or gardeners. Stefan Cross was the claims lawyer who acted for the majority of the women The majority of the 16,000 equal pay claimants were represented by private claims company Action 4 Equality, run by lawyer Stefan Cross. Employment lawyer Carol Fox, who worked with Mr Cross on the Glasgow case, told BBC Scotland that the unions only began to put claims in for the women when they saw the success of claims companies, who were taking on councils and winning. By the time of the settlement with Glasgow, Unison had dealt with 5,000 claims, while the GMB had more than 2,500 and Unite had 345 claims. The unions promised members they would get all the money they were owed. However, BBC Disclosure can reveal that, when Glasgow City Council finally conceded last year, the three unions - as well as Action 4 Equality - entered into a deal before negotiations began. Employment lawyer Carol Fox said she was ""troubled"" by aspects of the settlement As part of this deal, it was agreed that every claimant would have a percentage of the settlement offered by the council deducted in legal fees. This included those backed by their unions. According to Stefan Cross 6.9% was deducted from ""all the claimants"", with a proportion being paid to his company, Action 4 Equality. In his interview with the BBC, Mr Cross acknowledged the percentage deducted equated to ""many millions"" of pounds. He said: ""The unions' proposal was that we had to agree parity, to start with. The cost of that is that fees had to be paid somehow. And this is the most fair, most beneficial way for everybody that we did it on that basis."" The BBC understands none of the claimants represented by their unions were told they would be paying fees. Under the terms of the settlement, none of the women are allowed to speak about how much they were awarded. They were also not told the formula that was used to calculate their offer. Each woman had an ""individual offer"" depending on how far back they were allowed to claim, how much they were underpaid per hour and how many hours they worked. Ms Fox, who also worked on equal pay cases in North and South Lanarkshire, said she was ""troubled"" by aspects of the settlement. She worked alongside Stefan Cross but left the company in 2015 and played no part in the final negotiations for the Glasgow settlement. ""That deal is very different from all the other settlements that we reached,"" she said. ""It doesn't appear to me that they've been told the detail of what they've paid. And who they've paid it to, and what it's been for."" Audrey Masson worked as a home carer for 15 years but is receiving only five years of back-pay All of the claimant organisations said their members or clients benefited from this deal and received higher offers by working together. But Audrey Masson, a home carer represented by the GMB, said: ""Nothing against Stefan Cross, why should we have to pay, because I never signed for him to represent me. I signed for the unions."" Helen Mitchell, a home carer represented by Unison, said: ""I object to paying Unison, I certainly object to paying Stefan Cross. I would like my money back."" Mr Cross, the director of Action 4 Equality, said that by signing their settlement offers, claimants agreed to the terms. He said: ""Every single agreement includes a legal commitment to make that payment."" Helen Mitchell said she would like her money back The unions said settlements were based on a ""complex formula"" and they could not discuss them because they were confidential. As well as the legal fees, BBC Disclosure also discovered that potentially thousands of workers have missed out on claiming for the full extent of their discrimination. Under Scottish law, workers who have been discriminated against are entitled to five years of back-pay if their case is successful. Because the pay dispute at Glasgow City Council has gone on since 2006, the maximum time period claimants can receive compensation for is 12 years. Audrey Masson worked as a home carer for 15 years but is receiving only five years of back-pay. She alleges her union never told her to put in a claim. She did eventually lodge a claim but too late to receive the full amount of 12 years of back-pay. Ms Masson said: ""We stood on the picket lines for equality, and we didn't even get it. Most of the people that stood on the picket lines didn't even know they were only getting five years."" According to Mr Cross, thousands of claims were lodged too late. He said it was a legal requirement that each individual must make their own decision as to whether they pursued a claim. But he said: ""It is undoubtedly the case that there was not a campaign by the trade unions in the early days to put in cases."" Mr Cross said: ""You have half the women getting [the full] worth of claim, and the other half getting a maximum of five years of claim, because their claims were not put in at the right time."" Ms Fox, who worked on numerous council equal pay claims, said the unions were ""conflicted"" because they had a concern for the higher-earning male workers who were also members. There was a fear their bonuses and extra payments could be lost if they pushed for equal pay for women, she said. The GMB union, which represented Ms Masson, denied that claims were put in late. In an interview with the BBC, Gary Smith, GMB Scotland secretary, said: ""We were given the wrong legal advice. He added: ""We did not pursue the same cases as the private lawyers, or indeed one of the other unions, but our members were not left at a detriment in the end."" Peter Hunter, Unison's regional manager, said the union was proactive in pursuing claims. He said: ""Some union members and some employees generally missed out, because the system is individual. People need to consent to have somebody act for them, and they need to lodge a personal claim."" The third union involved, Unite, said it did not accept its members had been left ""in any detriment by failing to support and submit early equal pay claims"".

"This video can not be played Harry Dunn suspect 'should do the right thing' The parents of a motorcyclist killed in a crash say they will only meet the US woman allegedly involved if she promises to return to Britain. Harry Dunn, 19, died in a crash near RAF Croughton, Northamptonshire. Anne Sacoolas left the UK under diplomatic immunity while police were investigating. She has offered to meet Mr Dunn's parents, who are in the US. A Dunn family spokesman said the parents' pre-condition for a meeting was a ""hurdle"" to it taking place. Radd Seiger told the BBC the parents, Charlotte Charles and Tim Dunn, who have travelled to the US, were unlikely to meet Mrs Sacoolas this week. ""Mrs Sacoolas has to commit to returning to the United Kingdom to submit herself to the English authorities, to Northamptonshire Police, and to co-operate with their inquiries,"" he said. Her return was ""a non-negotiable red line"", he told Sky News. This video can not be played Harry Dunn's mother says Mrs Sacoolas's statement is ""too little, too late"" The parents hope to gainmedia exposure in the US, to put pressure on President Donald Trump ""to send Mrs Sacoolas back"", he said and have been involved in a round of media interviews on Monday. Ms Charles told the BBC's Duncan Kennedy they had received messages of support from people in the US ""probably in their thousands"", and similar messages from ""all around the world"". ""I think everyone can see she's not done the right thing and she needs to do the right thing. She should have just stayed. It should not have come to this. It's ludicrous,"" she added. Speaking on CBS This Morning, Mr Dunn described how he spoke to his son for the last time as paramedics loaded him on to a stretcher by the roadside. Tim Dunn spoke to Gayle King on CBS's This Morning programme in the US ""I could see broken bones out of his arms and stuff. He was talking. He knew [that I was there],"" said Mr Dunn. ""I called over to him and said 'Harry, it's your dad - they are going to fix you. Be calm. Let them help you'."" Later Mr Dunn told a press conference: ""I've always wanted to ask her if she could explain the moment of the crash. Find out if she comforted Harry. If she spoke to Harry. Find out what her movements were. Did she try and call the emergency services? ""I'm just struggling because I can't imagine my lad being in the ditch and not having any comfort from anybody until the ambulance and police turn up 'X' minutes later."" Ms Charles added: ""We're not inhumane, we still don't wish her any ill harm but we need to hear it from her, in her own words, in a room, on our terms, in the UK with therapists and whoever else can help us, mediators. ""But just hearing it through a statement...we're seven weeks in now, it's a bit too much too little too late, I'm afraid."" Harry Dunn died in hospital after his motorbike was involved in a crash with a Volvo At a press conference last week. a briefing note held by Mr Trump at the press conference appeared to suggest Mrs Sacoolaswould not be returning to the UK. Mr Dunn said: ""I would say to him (President Trump) as a man, as a father, how could you let this happen, if you are a father and your child died surely you'd want that person to own up and take responsibility for their action?"" Mr Seiger said on Radio 4's Today programme the weeks since the teenager's death had been ""a very, very dark time"" for the family and that ""every second that passes is another second of pain"". Discussions over Anne Sacoolas's potential extradition from the US are likely to be a ""delicate interplay"" of legal obligations and political realities, says an expert in international law. Mrs Sacoolas's case appears to meet the conditions agreed in theUS-UK extradition treaty,externalin force since 2007, said Prof Tarcisio Gazzini from the University of East Anglia. Given that she is no longer in the UK, diplomatic immunity no longer applies, he said. Prof Gazzini predicted the process was likely to end in one of two ways - Mrs Sacoolas agreeing to return to the UK to face prosecution; or the US extraditing her in accordance with the treaty, and waiving her immunity. It is unlikely she would return to the UK to reinvoke diplomatic immunity, he said. Prof Gazzini said: ""My guess is that the US will discuss this with the lady and say that they are prepared to allow her to be tried in the UK. ""The two governments would prefer to go through the treaty, and preferably through Article 17 [where she agrees to be surrendered]. ""Assuming all the conditions are satisfied and documents are in order then the US is obliged to [extradite]. If not, they commit a breach of international law."" Mrs Sacoolas is reportedly married to a US intelligence official. A letter from her lawyers said she wanted to meet Mr Dunn's parents ""so that she can express herdeepest sympathies and apologiesfor this tragic accident"". Mrs Sacoolas, 42, was said to be covered by diplomatic immunity as the spouse of a US intelligence official, though thatprotection is now in dispute. On Saturday, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab wrote to Mr Dunn's family to explain that the British and US governments now consideredMrs Sacoolas's immunity irrelevant. He said the matter was now ""in the hands"" of Northamptonshire Police and the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS).

"Harry Styles said he still checks ""weak spots"" in his home after he said he received notes through his letterbox A homeless man who camped outside pop star Harry Styles' house for several months has been found guilty of stalking the singer. Mr Styles, 25, offered to buy Pablo Tarazaga-Orero, 26, food after he saw him sleeping rough outside his north west London home in March. Speaking at Hendon Magistrates' Court, the singer said he locks his bedroom door every night after being followed. Mr Styles said the man's behaviour was ""erratic and frightening"". The former One Direction singer said he was ""sad to see someone so young sleeping rough"" when he first saw Tarazaga-Orero. He bought him vegan sandwiches, salads and muffins, after the rough sleeper asked for some edamame beans. After trying to cut contact, the pop star saw him nearly every day, and received notes and money in his letterbox, District Judge Nigel Deane heard. When asked whether he had stalked the celebrity, Tarazaga-Orero said: ""That was never my intention. In the end I just wanted the money he offered me. ""I don't have any feelings for him. I'm not in love with him."" Tarazaga-Orero will be sentenced on 21 October.

"This video can not be played Atwood and Evaristo become the first authors to jointly win the Booker Prize since 1992 Margaret Atwood and Bernardine Evaristo have been named the joint winners of the 2019 Booker Prize after the judges broke their rules by declaring a tie. Atwood's The Testaments, the Canadian writer's follow-up to The Handmaid's Tale, was recognised alongside Londoner Evaristo's novel Girl, Woman, Other. The pair will split the literary award's Â£50,000 prize money equally. The Booker rules say the prize must not be divided, but the judges insisted they ""couldn't separate"" the two works. Atwood, 79, is the oldest ever Booker winner, while Evaristo is the first black woman to win. After their names were called, the pair stood arm-in-arm on stage and Atwood joked: ""I would have thought I would have been too elderly, and I kind of don't need the attention, so I'm very glad that you're getting some. ""It would have been quite embarrassing for meâ¦ if I had been alone here, so I'm very pleased that you're here too."" Atwood praised Evaristo for encouraging black female writers The award's rules were changed after the last tie in 1992, and organisers told this year's judges they were not allowed to pick two winners. But after five hours of deliberations, Peter Florence, the chair of the judges, said: ""It was our decision to flout the rules."" He told reporters: ""The more we talked about them, the more we found we loved them both so much we wanted them both to win."" Evaristo and Atwood spoke together on Radio 4's Today programme on Tuesday morning. Evaristo said winning was ""a real game changer"", adding: ""It means my work gets out there to a much wider audience around the world. ""There are lots of prizes which people from certain communities don't win, certainly black people don't win lots of literary awards. No one seems to notice, but it's really important. ""A black woman has never won [the Booker before]. Only four black women have ever been shortlisted and there have been about 300 books shortlisted. ""Hopefully this signals a new direction for the Booker and the kind of judges they have. This year there were four women judges and one male. ""I hope more black women win this prize."" Atwood, who is from Ottawa, said: ""It's great to be sharing with Bernardineâ¦ and I certainly hope you'll come to Canada, bring your warm clothing!"" She told Evaristo: ""What you have done is to make it possible for more black women to consider that writing is something they can do."" It is 19 years since Atwood won the Booker for The Blind Assassin, and 33 years since she was nominated for The Handmaid's Tale. With the latter book enjoying newfound popularity and resonance against the backdrop of Donald Trump's America, The Testaments picks up 15 years after the end of that novel. Returning to the totalitarian, patriarchal Gilead, it is narrated by Aunt Lydia, one of the handmaids' instructors, and two teenage girls. Peter Florence said: ""It does massively more than follow the single story that we had from Offred. This is beautiful in its depth and exploration of the world of Gilead. ""As [Atwood] has said, it might have looked like science fiction back in the day, although all of the extremities are rooted in fact. Now it looks more politically urgent than ever before."" Published in September, The Testaments sold more than 100,000 copies in the UK in its first week, making it the fastest-selling hardback novel in four years. Speaking before the ceremony, Atwood said winning would be ""a double-edged sword for me, but for a younger person I think it would be great"". Bernardine Evaristo was born the fourth of eight children, in Woolwich, south east London, to an English mother and a Nigerian father. Her father was a welder and local Labour councillor; her mother was a schoolteacher. She spent her teenage years at Greenwich Young People's Theatre, which was where she first became involved in the arts.. She went on to study at Goldsmiths, University of London, where she earned her PhD in creative writing. A career in theatre followed and she was a co-founder of the Theatre of Black Women company in 1982. She also set up the Spread the Word writer development agency, the Complete Works mentoring scheme for poets of colour and the Brunel International African Poetry Prize. She was made an MBE in 2009 for services to literature. Girl, Woman, Other is 60-year-old Evaristo's eighth novel. It gives a chapter each to the lives of 12 intertwining characters, who are mostly black British women. ""We black British women know that if we don't write ourselves into literature no one else will,""the author has said,external. Lesbian theatre director Amma, non-binary Morgan (formerly Megan), Barbadian bride Winsome and Northumbrian farmer Hattie are among the characters in a book that spans more than 100 years. Peter Florence said there was ""something utterly magical"" about the book's characters, whom he said ""give a wonderful spectrum of black British women today"". ""There are stories there of people who haven't been visibly represented in contemporary literature, and in that sense this book is groundbreaking, and I hope encouraging and inspiring to the rest of the publishing industry."" In her acceptance speech, Evaristo said she hoped it would not be long before another black woman won the prize. ""It's so incredible to share this with Margaret Atwood, who's such a legend and so generous,"" she said. ""A lot of people say, 'I never thought it would happen to me', and I will say I am the first black woman to win this prize, and I hope that honour doesn't last too long. I hope other people come forward now."" She has called Girl, Woman, Other ""a readable experimental novel"". The experimental element mainly comes from the unorthodox punctuation, which often dispenses with quotation marks and capital letters. The Booker Prize rules,externalstate that the prize ""may not be divided or withheld"". The award has been shared twice before - in 1974 and 1992 - but the rules were then changed. ""The thinking was it just doesn't work - it sort of detracts attention from both, rather than drawing attention to either,"" said Gaby Wood, literary director of the Booker Prize Foundation. So when Florence told her the five judges wanted to announce a tie, she said no. The judges got back around the table. Again, they told Wood they wanted two winners. This time, Wood phoned Baroness Kennedy QC, chair of the Booker Prize Foundation, who told her: ""Absolutely not."" The judges deliberated again. ""We tried voting, it didn't work,"" Florence said. ""There's a metaphor for our times. And equally, today of all days, when rebellion is in the air, maybe we were a little moved by that."" The panel resolved to hold firm on their split decision. Baroness Kennedy was called again. ""She said, 'Well, if that's what they've chosen to do, there's nothing we can do,'"" Wood said. ""We had to move on."" Florence added that both winning books ""have urgent things to say"". He told reporters: ""They also happen to be wonderfully compelling, page-turning thrillers, which can speak to the most literary audience, to readers who maybe are only reading one, or in this case I hope two books a year, and can speak at different levels to all sorts of different readerships. ""So in that sense they are, I hope and believe, really valuable Booker Prize winners.""

"Jack Monroe says she has lost about Â£5,000 after her phone number was hijacked and re-activated on another Sim card. The criminals were then able to receive her two-factor authentication messages and access her bank and payment accounts. The bestselling food writer tweeted she was ""paranoid about security"" and already had strong measures in place. A privacy campaigner said the industry had failed to address ""Simjacking"". Ms Monroe tweeted she was ""white-hot angry"" and had been told although she should get her phone number back soon, the money ""will take longer to recover"". ""The money stolen has run into thousands of pounds - I'm a self-employed freelancer and I have to absolutely hustle for every single pound I earn. And someone has just helped themselves to around five thousand of them,"" she tweeted. Ms Monroe is a best-known for her low-cost recipes and her support for anti-poverty campaigns. In 2017, shesuccessfully sued the right-wing commentator Katie Hopkins for libel. Simjacking, also known as Simswapping, is when criminals port a phone number over to a new Sim card, which they can then use as if it was their own. They do this by posing as a customer who wishes to move to a different mobile provider but keep their existing phone number. While mobile phone operators often request personal information to complete the request, this can be data already in the public domain - Ms Monroe's date of birth, for example, was on Wikipedia. Sometimes individuals working for mobile operators or phone shops can be bribed into making the switch. Mobile phone shop staff 'enabling scams' Often the first clue for the victim is when their own phone stops working. Increasingly, banks and other services will use a text message to send a code as an extra layer of security to a registered phone number before allowing access to an account. One critic of the industry's response to the crime is a privacy campaigner who used to work for the GSMA, the trade body that represents mobile operators. Pat Walshe, now managing director of Privacy Matters, told BBC News the scale of the problem in the UK was currently unknown but there were cases of Simjacking from around the world.

"A British man jailed for numerous sex crimes against Malaysian children has been found stabbed to death in prison. Richard Huckle, 33, from Ashford, Kent, abused as many as 200 children. In 2016, he was given 22 life sentences after admitting 71 charges of sex abuse of children aged between six months and 12 years, between 2006 and 2014. It is understood he was attacked on Sunday in his cell at Full Sutton Prison, near York, with what was described as a makeshift knife. Police were called shortly after 12:30pm and have launched an investigation into his death, which they are treating as suspicious. Huckle's trial at the Old Bailey in 2016 heard that investigators who checked his computer found more than 20,000 indecent pictures and videos of his assaults. These were shared with paedophiles worldwide through a hidden website on the so-called dark web. Malaysia abuse Briton gets 22 life terms How Richard Huckle was caught Huckle, who worked as a freelance photographer, tried to make a business out of his abuse by crowd-funding the release of the images. He was compiling a paedophile's manual at the time of his arrest in 2014. At the end of his trial, Judge Peter Rook said Huckle's sentence reflected the ""public abhorrence"" over his ""campaign of rape"". He said: ""It is very rare indeed that a judge has to sentence sexual offending by one person on such a scale as this."" This video can not be played The BBC's Angus Crawford traces the path of Richard Huckle in Kuala Lumpur Huckle was arrested at Gatwick Airport by National Crime Agency officials in December 2014, following a tip-off by Australian authorities. He presented himself as a practising Christian and first visited Malaysia on a teaching gap year when he was 18 or 19. He went on to groom children while doing voluntary work. In online posts, Huckle had bragged: ""Impoverished kids are definitely much easier to seduce than middle-class Western kids."" Commenting on one of his victims, he boasted: ""I'd hit the jackpot, a 3yo girl as loyal to me as my dog and nobody seemed to care."" Huckle's encrypted paedophile manual was found on his laptop ready for publication on the dark web. Last year,BBC Three produced a documentaryabout Huckle, which explored his proximity to children in Cambodia, India and the UK. Malaysians deplore 'devil' Huckle The 'gap year' paedophile Richard Huckle 'highly likely' to have had UK victims In it, retired police officer Jim Gamble, who used to lead child abuse investigations in Britain, called for a more extensive investigation into potential abuses in the UK. Full Sutton is a maximum security men's prison around 11 miles east of York that holds ""some of themost difficult and dangerous criminals in the country,external"", according to the Ministry of Justice website. Residents have protested against plans to expand Full Sutton Paedophile Richard Huckle stabbed to death in jail It has a total capacity of around 550, and holds only Category A prisoners, whose escape would be consideredhighly dangerous,,externaland Category B prisoners, whose escape must be made ""very difficult"". Last August one hundred officers were calledwhen a prisoner went on a rampage, attacking staff and starting a fire. Plans to build a Category C facility alongside the current facilities,making a 1,440-inmate ""mega prison"",have been opposed by Humberside Police, who fear it would increase violent crime within the jail and raise demands on the force.

"This video can not be played What did we learn from the Queen's Speech? The BBC's Helen Catt explains Boris Johnson's government has set out ""ambitious"" policies on crime, health, the environment and Brexit in a Queen's Speech that opposition parties have dismissed as an ""election manifesto"". Plans for tougher sentences for violent offenders and legal targets for cutting plastic pollution are among 26 bills set out at Parliament's State Opening. The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg said it was a ""long shopping list"". But with the PM having no majority, many of the bills may not become law. Our political editor said the PM was keen to focus on ""bread and butter issues"" like investment in schools and the NHS, or coming up with, at long last, a new way of funding care for the elderly. But she said there was no guarantee the legislative programme would be approved by Parliament. If MPs reject it, it will trigger renewed calls for a general election. During a debate in the Commons later on Monday, Mr Johnson said his plans offered ""a new age of opportunity for the whole country"". But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the speech was ""a propaganda exercise"", adding: ""The prime minister promised that this Queen's Speech would dazzle us. On closer inspection, it is nothing more than fool's gold."" MPs will be able to debate the Queen's speech for a further five days, with a different theme for each of them, including the NHS and the economy. All the pomp - but very bizarre circumstances Bill by bill - what does Boris Johnson want to do? Robes, tiaras and fanfare: Inside the Queen's Speech Why didn't the Queen wear her crown? Despite continuing Brexit uncertainty, the government has said it is determined to press ahead with its plans, announcing its intention tohold a Budget on 6 November. Negotiations over the UK's departure,with Mr Johnson trying to secure an agreement that will enable the country to leave by 31 October. The government says if it can strike a deal with the EU, it will introduce a withdrawal agreement bill and aim to secure its passage through Parliament before the Halloween deadline. This video can not be played Queen outlines government's Brexit plan The origins of the current State Opening date back to the 1850s The prime minister's partner, Carrie Symonds, was among those watching Labour described the Queen's Speech as a ""party political broadcast"" This video can not be played A look at the fanfare and formality behind this year's State Opening of Parliament The Queen's Speech is famous for its pageantry - with the monarch arriving at the Palace of Westminster in a carriage procession and delivering her speech from the throne in the House of Lords, flanked by the Prince of Wales. Mr Johnson said his government was focused on ""seizing the opportunities that Brexit present"". The 26 bills include,external: Seven pieces of Brexit-related legislation, including measures to establish new regulatory frameworks for fishing, farming, trade and financial services, and a bill to end freedom of movement and bring in a points-based immigration system from 2021. Seven criminal justice bills, including measures that will increase sentences for about 3,000 serious or violent criminals by ending automatic release at the half-way point, tougher penalties for foreign national offenders who try to return to the UK after being deported, and greater protection for police officers. Domestic violence legislation will also be carried over from the last session. Plans for an independent NHS investigations body with legal powers - the Health Service Safety Investigations Body (HSSIB) - to look into ""serious healthcare incidents"", and a pledge to update the Mental Health Act to reduce the number of detentions. An environment bill to ""enshrine principles in law"" and set legally binding ""improvement targets"" to reduce plastics, cut air pollution, restore biodiversity and improve water quality. A separate animal welfare bill to outlaw trophy hunting. Proposed reforms to the divorce laws to minimise the impact of family breakdown on children, and changes in employment law to require restaurants and cafes to give waiting staff ""all tips"" owed to them. There is also a commitment to reform adult social care in England, although no legislation planned at this stage. New measures will also be brought forward to tackle electoral fraud, including requiring people to show an approved form of ID before voting in general and local elections. A shake-up of the rail franchising system in England is also being proposed to improve service reliability, reduce ""fragmentation"" and introduce a ""greater distance"" between ministers and the day-to-day running of the network. Law and order - what has the PM promised? Could there be an early general election? Mr Johnson said the programme, which includes four bills carried over from the last session, demonstrated Brexit was not the limit of the government's ambitions. He told the Commons: ""At the heart of this speech is an ambitious programme to unite this country with energy, optimism and with the basic common sense of one-nation Conservatism."" But Mr Corbyn criticised a number of the proposals, saying mental health care was ""getting worse and worse"", social care proposals ""offered the same promise after two years of inaction and failure"", and plans for education were ""shockingly weak"". He told MPs: ""There has never been such a farce of a government with a majority of minus 45 and a 100% record of defeat in the House of Commons, setting out a legislative agenda they know cannot be delivered in this Parliament."" Brexit talks continue ahead of crunch summit What is Boris Johnson's Brexit plan? Could no-deal still happen? The SNP's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, focused his criticism on the PM's plans for Brexit, saying the UK had ""entered very dark days"". He said the EU was ""the greatest example of political co-operation and peace - leaving behind the scars of war, the pain of loss, and instead choosing to take the hand of friendship across this continent"" and to leave would be a ""tragedy"". Former Tory cabinet minister Dominic Grieve, who now sits as an independent after rebelling over Brexit, said the PM would find it ""very difficult"" to govern until Brexit was resolved. That was a very long shopping list of things, but the unsaid reality, of course, is that the biggest question hanging over it all is Brexit. The Queen may have said the government's priority is to leave on 31 October, but there's no way anyone in this square mile can be sure that happens. Whether it happens - and how it happens - is a much bigger influence than anything we've just heard being said. In many ways, it's a Queen's Speech from a parallel universe - one in which Boris Johnson gets his way. Where he definitely gets his deal with Brussels by the end of this week, he definitely gets it through Parliament on Saturday and definitely gets all the Brexit legislation passed. It's also a world in which he definitely gets the general election he wants in the next few weeks and then definitely gets a Conservative majority. We shouldn't dismiss this speech - it does mean something, but what it means is this is what we are likely to see as the basis for a Conservative manifesto whenever that election does come.

"This video can not be played Harry Dunn suspect 'should do the right thing' The parents of a motorcyclist killed in a crash say they will only meet the US woman allegedly involved if she promises to return to Britain. Harry Dunn, 19, died in a crash near RAF Croughton, Northamptonshire. Anne Sacoolas left the UK under diplomatic immunity while police were investigating. She has offered to meet Mr Dunn's parents, who are in the US. A Dunn family spokesman said the parents' pre-condition for a meeting was a ""hurdle"" to it taking place. Radd Seiger told the BBC the parents, Charlotte Charles and Tim Dunn, who have travelled to the US, were unlikely to meet Mrs Sacoolas this week. ""Mrs Sacoolas has to commit to returning to the United Kingdom to submit herself to the English authorities, to Northamptonshire Police, and to co-operate with their inquiries,"" he said. Her return was ""a non-negotiable red line"", he told Sky News. This video can not be played Harry Dunn's mother says Mrs Sacoolas's statement is ""too little, too late"" The parents hope to gainmedia exposure in the US, to put pressure on President Donald Trump ""to send Mrs Sacoolas back"", he said and have been involved in a round of media interviews on Monday. Ms Charles told the BBC's Duncan Kennedy they had received messages of support from people in the US ""probably in their thousands"", and similar messages from ""all around the world"". ""I think everyone can see she's not done the right thing and she needs to do the right thing. She should have just stayed. It should not have come to this. It's ludicrous,"" she added. Speaking on CBS This Morning, Mr Dunn described how he spoke to his son for the last time as paramedics loaded him on to a stretcher by the roadside. Tim Dunn spoke to Gayle King on CBS's This Morning programme in the US ""I could see broken bones out of his arms and stuff. He was talking. He knew [that I was there],"" said Mr Dunn. ""I called over to him and said 'Harry, it's your dad - they are going to fix you. Be calm. Let them help you'."" Later Mr Dunn told a press conference: ""I've always wanted to ask her if she could explain the moment of the crash. Find out if she comforted Harry. If she spoke to Harry. Find out what her movements were. Did she try and call the emergency services? ""I'm just struggling because I can't imagine my lad being in the ditch and not having any comfort from anybody until the ambulance and police turn up 'X' minutes later."" Ms Charles added: ""We're not inhumane, we still don't wish her any ill harm but we need to hear it from her, in her own words, in a room, on our terms, in the UK with therapists and whoever else can help us, mediators. ""But just hearing it through a statement...we're seven weeks in now, it's a bit too much too little too late, I'm afraid."" Harry Dunn died in hospital after his motorbike was involved in a crash with a Volvo At a press conference last week. a briefing note held by Mr Trump at the press conference appeared to suggest Mrs Sacoolaswould not be returning to the UK. Mr Dunn said: ""I would say to him (President Trump) as a man, as a father, how could you let this happen, if you are a father and your child died surely you'd want that person to own up and take responsibility for their action?"" Mr Seiger said on Radio 4's Today programme the weeks since the teenager's death had been ""a very, very dark time"" for the family and that ""every second that passes is another second of pain"". Discussions over Anne Sacoolas's potential extradition from the US are likely to be a ""delicate interplay"" of legal obligations and political realities, says an expert in international law. Mrs Sacoolas's case appears to meet the conditions agreed in theUS-UK extradition treaty,externalin force since 2007, said Prof Tarcisio Gazzini from the University of East Anglia. Given that she is no longer in the UK, diplomatic immunity no longer applies, he said. Prof Gazzini predicted the process was likely to end in one of two ways - Mrs Sacoolas agreeing to return to the UK to face prosecution; or the US extraditing her in accordance with the treaty, and waiving her immunity. It is unlikely she would return to the UK to reinvoke diplomatic immunity, he said. Prof Gazzini said: ""My guess is that the US will discuss this with the lady and say that they are prepared to allow her to be tried in the UK. ""The two governments would prefer to go through the treaty, and preferably through Article 17 [where she agrees to be surrendered]. ""Assuming all the conditions are satisfied and documents are in order then the US is obliged to [extradite]. If not, they commit a breach of international law."" Mrs Sacoolas is reportedly married to a US intelligence official. A letter from her lawyers said she wanted to meet Mr Dunn's parents ""so that she can express herdeepest sympathies and apologiesfor this tragic accident"". Mrs Sacoolas, 42, was said to be covered by diplomatic immunity as the spouse of a US intelligence official, though thatprotection is now in dispute. On Saturday, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab wrote to Mr Dunn's family to explain that the British and US governments now consideredMrs Sacoolas's immunity irrelevant. He said the matter was now ""in the hands"" of Northamptonshire Police and the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS).

The 28-year-old died after being dragged under a vehicle on a road near Sulhamstead, Berkshire, on 15 August. His widow Lissie Harper said he ""wore his uniform with pride"". Reading the eulogy, she said: ""You used to tell me we were a team and that we would get through all of life's hurdles together, how I wish you were here with me now. The hardest challenge of all is losing you. ""Keeping everyone safe was your priority, not only in your job but with your family too. Everything was always okay when you were around. ""Although Andrew was strong he was also unfailingly kind, a gentle giant with a heart of gold."" The couple, who were childhood sweethearts and had been together for 13 years, had only been married for four weeks. She added: ""He was my hero and his spirit will live on in my memories forever."" PC Andrew Harper had married his wife Lissie four weeks before his death Earlier members of the public paid their respects as the cortege led by mounted officers travelled through Oxford before the service, which was attended by 800 mourners. The coffin was draped in a navy flag with a police crest on the side and was carried into the cathedral at 11:00 BST by six officers. Leading the service, the Dean of Christ Church the Very Rev Dr Martyn Percy said: ""The tributes that have poured in for Andrew exemplify a truly outstanding young man, but also the very best virtues in policing. ""He represented policing at its best. He was everything you wanted in a police officer. Authentic, brave, genuine, and kind."" Lissie Harper left a symbol of her husband's life during the service Mrs Harper placed her husband's police hat on his coffin, while members of PC Harper's family also laid symbols of his life in front of a large photograph of him inside the cathedral.

Today she, with other family and friends, came to Christ Church Cathedral to say their final goodbye. People who didn't know him came out to pay their respects. Hundreds of officers from PC Harper's force also lined the route. Many looked as young as he was. As the hearse led by officers on horseback passed, silence fell. Officers bowed their heads. Some people in the crowds began to cry. Through the glass of the hearse PC Harper's coffin could be seen draped in a Thames Valley Police flag. A young officer who died while doing his job. A hero to so many. PC Harper, from Wallingford in Oxfordshire, was killed on the A4 Bath Road while investigating a reported break-in.

Thomas King, 21, from Basingstoke, is also accused of conspiracy to steal a quad bike. Jed Foster was also accused of murderbut prosecutors dropped his charges following further police investigation. PC Andrew Harper's order of service Today I would like to remember and honour the kind brave and lovely man we all know. We are all here just for you. From the ever sweet, lanky, red faced boy passing me notes in class, to the strong and loyal man you grew to be. I have always known how special you are. We often talked about how lucky we were to have found and kept each other, true childhood sweethearts, loving one another more and more with each passing day. Not a day went past that we didn't say I love you. You used to tell me we were a team and that we would get through all of life's hurdles together, how I wish you were here with me now. The hardest challenge of all is losing you. We managed to pack so many amazing memories into the last 13 years, travelling the world, buying a house and getting married. You had a contagious love for life, filling each day with laughter and appreciating all the little things. You have always been a protector. Whether in your role of big brother, fierce friend, loving husband or keeper of peace among the public, keeping everyone safe was your priority, not only in your job but your family too. Everything was always okay when you were around. Although Andrew was strong he was also unfailingly kind, a gentle giant with a heart of gold. He wore his uniform with pride and vowed to challenge the bad and celebrate the good. He loved to be part of a team and had a work ethic to admire. Looking around me today I know that he was classed so very highly among his peers, known for being proactive, kind and fair.

Mrs Sacoolas's case appears to meet the conditions agreed in theUS-UK extradition treaty,externalin force since 2007, said Prof Tarcisio Gazzini from the University of East Anglia. Given that she is no longer in the UK, diplomatic immunity no longer applies, he said. Prof Gazzini predicted the process was likely to end in one of two ways - Mrs Sacoolas agreeing to return to the UK to face prosecution; or the US extraditing her in accordance with the treaty, and waiving her immunity. It is unlikely she would return to the UK to reinvoke diplomatic immunity, he said. Prof Gazzini said: ""My guess is that the US will discuss this with the lady and say that they are prepared to allow her to be tried in the UK. ""The two governments would prefer to go through the treaty, and preferably through Article 17 [where she agrees to be surrendered]. ""Assuming all the conditions are satisfied and documents are in order then the US is obliged to [extradite]. If not, they commit a breach of international law."" Mrs Sacoolas is reportedly married to a US intelligence official. A letter from her lawyers said she wanted to meet Mr Dunn's parents ""so that she can express herdeepest sympathies and apologiesfor this tragic accident"". Mrs Sacoolas, 42, was said to be covered by diplomatic immunity as the spouse of a US intelligence official, though thatprotection is now in dispute. On Saturday, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab wrote to Mr Dunn's family to explain that the British and US governments now consideredMrs Sacoolas's immunity irrelevant. He said the matter was now ""in the hands"" of Northamptonshire Police and the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS).

"Thousands of council workers staged a strike over the dispute Thousands of women who fought Glasgow City Council for equal pay have had money deducted to pay legal fees, despite pledges from their unions. Members of Unison, Unite and the GMB were told they would get 100% of the settlement money offered. ButBBC Disclosurehas seen legal documents showing ""all claimants"" have had fees ""deducted"". The long-running dispute over women being paid less than men in jobs of the same grade was settled in January. Glasgow City Council agreed to pay out a reported Â£548m to compensate the women for the money they should have been paid, in many cases going back to 2006 when the new job evaluation scheme was adopted. The scheme was supposed to ensure that men and women received equal pay for jobs of the same value. But instead, some traditionally female-dominated roles such as catering or home care ended up being paid up to Â£3 an hour less than male-dominated jobs such as bin lorry workers or gardeners. Stefan Cross was the claims lawyer who acted for the majority of the women The majority of the 16,000 equal pay claimants were represented by private claims company Action 4 Equality, run by lawyer Stefan Cross. Employment lawyer Carol Fox, who worked with Mr Cross on the Glasgow case, told BBC Scotland that the unions only began to put claims in for the women when they saw the success of claims companies, who were taking on councils and winning. By the time of the settlement with Glasgow, Unison had dealt with 5,000 claims, while the GMB had more than 2,500 and Unite had 345 claims. The unions promised members they would get all the money they were owed. However, BBC Disclosure can reveal that, when Glasgow City Council finally conceded last year, the three unions - as well as Action 4 Equality - entered into a deal before negotiations began. Employment lawyer Carol Fox said she was ""troubled"" by aspects of the settlement As part of this deal, it was agreed that every claimant would have a percentage of the settlement offered by the council deducted in legal fees. This included those backed by their unions. According to Stefan Cross 6.9% was deducted from ""all the claimants"", with a proportion being paid to his company, Action 4 Equality. In his interview with the BBC, Mr Cross acknowledged the percentage deducted equated to ""many millions"" of pounds. He said: ""The unions' proposal was that we had to agree parity, to start with. The cost of that is that fees had to be paid somehow. And this is the most fair, most beneficial way for everybody that we did it on that basis."" The BBC understands none of the claimants represented by their unions were told they would be paying fees. Under the terms of the settlement, none of the women are allowed to speak about how much they were awarded. They were also not told the formula that was used to calculate their offer. Each woman had an ""individual offer"" depending on how far back they were allowed to claim, how much they were underpaid per hour and how many hours they worked. Ms Fox, who also worked on equal pay cases in North and South Lanarkshire, said she was ""troubled"" by aspects of the settlement. She worked alongside Stefan Cross but left the company in 2015 and played no part in the final negotiations for the Glasgow settlement. ""That deal is very different from all the other settlements that we reached,"" she said. ""It doesn't appear to me that they've been told the detail of what they've paid. And who they've paid it to, and what it's been for."" Audrey Masson worked as a home carer for 15 years but is receiving only five years of back-pay All of the claimant organisations said their members or clients benefited from this deal and received higher offers by working together. But Audrey Masson, a home carer represented by the GMB, said: ""Nothing against Stefan Cross, why should we have to pay, because I never signed for him to represent me. I signed for the unions."" Helen Mitchell, a home carer represented by Unison, said: ""I object to paying Unison, I certainly object to paying Stefan Cross. I would like my money back."" Mr Cross, the director of Action 4 Equality, said that by signing their settlement offers, claimants agreed to the terms. He said: ""Every single agreement includes a legal commitment to make that payment."" Helen Mitchell said she would like her money back The unions said settlements were based on a ""complex formula"" and they could not discuss them because they were confidential. As well as the legal fees, BBC Disclosure also discovered that potentially thousands of workers have missed out on claiming for the full extent of their discrimination. Under Scottish law, workers who have been discriminated against are entitled to five years of back-pay if their case is successful. Because the pay dispute at Glasgow City Council has gone on since 2006, the maximum time period claimants can receive compensation for is 12 years. Audrey Masson worked as a home carer for 15 years but is receiving only five years of back-pay. She alleges her union never told her to put in a claim. She did eventually lodge a claim but too late to receive the full amount of 12 years of back-pay. Ms Masson said: ""We stood on the picket lines for equality, and we didn't even get it. Most of the people that stood on the picket lines didn't even know they were only getting five years."" According to Mr Cross, thousands of claims were lodged too late. He said it was a legal requirement that each individual must make their own decision as to whether they pursued a claim. But he said: ""It is undoubtedly the case that there was not a campaign by the trade unions in the early days to put in cases."" Mr Cross said: ""You have half the women getting [the full] worth of claim, and the other half getting a maximum of five years of claim, because their claims were not put in at the right time."" Ms Fox, who worked on numerous council equal pay claims, said the unions were ""conflicted"" because they had a concern for the higher-earning male workers who were also members. There was a fear their bonuses and extra payments could be lost if they pushed for equal pay for women, she said. The GMB union, which represented Ms Masson, denied that claims were put in late. In an interview with the BBC, Gary Smith, GMB Scotland secretary, said: ""We were given the wrong legal advice. He added: ""We did not pursue the same cases as the private lawyers, or indeed one of the other unions, but our members were not left at a detriment in the end."" Peter Hunter, Unison's regional manager, said the union was proactive in pursuing claims. He said: ""Some union members and some employees generally missed out, because the system is individual. People need to consent to have somebody act for them, and they need to lodge a personal claim."" The third union involved, Unite, said it did not accept its members had been left ""in any detriment by failing to support and submit early equal pay claims"".

"Harry Styles said he still checks ""weak spots"" in his home after he said he received notes through his letterbox A homeless man who camped outside pop star Harry Styles' house for several months has been found guilty of stalking the singer. Mr Styles, 25, offered to buy Pablo Tarazaga-Orero, 26, food after he saw him sleeping rough outside his north west London home in March. Speaking at Hendon Magistrates' Court, the singer said he locks his bedroom door every night after being followed. Mr Styles said the man's behaviour was ""erratic and frightening"". The former One Direction singer said he was ""sad to see someone so young sleeping rough"" when he first saw Tarazaga-Orero. He bought him vegan sandwiches, salads and muffins, after the rough sleeper asked for some edamame beans. After trying to cut contact, the pop star saw him nearly every day, and received notes and money in his letterbox, District Judge Nigel Deane heard. When asked whether he had stalked the celebrity, Tarazaga-Orero said: ""That was never my intention. In the end I just wanted the money he offered me. ""I don't have any feelings for him.

"Salih Khater said he had panicked after getting lost, causing him to drive into pedestrians, cyclists and police A man who drove at cyclists and police officers outside Parliament has been jailed for life for attempted murder. Salih Khater, 30, of Highgate Street, Birmingham, aimed his car at members of the public before swerving towards the officers in Parliament Square on 14 August 2018. He must serve at least 15 years in jail, the Old Bailey judge said. Khater was accused of attempting to cause maximum carnage, and it was said to be ""miraculous"" no-one was killed. The silver Ford Fiesta driven by Khater smashed into a security barrier The court was told he tried to ""kill as many people as possible"" with his Ford Fiesta. CCTV footage showed how he careered into a security lane and crashed into barriers as two police officers jumped out of the way. Alison Morgan QC told jurors Khater's attack was ""premeditated and deliberate"" and had a terrorist motive. The defendant claimed he had driven to London to find the Sudanese embassy to get a visa but ""got lost"" around Westminster and panicked. However, a jury rejected his explanation for the crash andfound him guiltyof two charges of attempted murder in July. This video can not be played Jurors were shown CCTV footage of the defendant's car driving at cyclists before crashing into barriers In mitigation, Peter Carter QC told the court Khater had still not offered an explanation for what he did. He argued: ""The lack of evidence is not a proper basis for drawing a conclusion there is evidence of a terrorist connection."" But Mrs Justice McGowan found Khater had deliberately copied terrorists. ""Your undoubted intention was to kill as many people as possible and by doing so spread fear and terror,"" she said; adding that he had ""replicated the acts of others who undoubtedly have acted with terrorist motives"". It was ""miraculous"" that no-one died as a result of the defendant's actions, the Old Bailey heard The court heard Khater was born in Sudan before being granted asylum in Britain in 2010, claiming he had been tortured in his birth country. In the months before the attack, Khater had showed signs of ""paranoia"" about British authorities, emailing Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to express concern about an ""event"" involving the intelligence services. Richard Smith, head of the Met's Counter Terrorism Command, said: ""This was a man who used his car as a weapon to attempt to kill as many people as possible, spreading fear and terror. ""It was our view that this attack was carried out with a terrorist purpose and the sentence confirms this,"" he added.

"The handwritten note was left on the windscreen of a police car in the city centre A young boy has thanked police for ""saving our lives and keeping us safe"" following the stabbings at Manchester's Arndale Centre. The handwritten note was left on the windscreen of a police patrol car in the city centre on Saturday.

"Esther Duflo has said she is ""humbled"" by her success in winning this year's Nobel prize for economics and hopes it will ""inspire many, many other women"". Prof Duflo was part of a trio, alongside her husband Abhijit Banerjee and Michael Kremer, to win the prize. Their work had ""dramatically improved our ability to fight poverty in practice"", the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which awards the prize, said. Prof Duflo is only the second woman to win the prize since it began in 1969. At 46 years old, she is also the youngest recipient of the prize. ""Showing that it is possible for a woman to succeed and be recognised for success I hope is going to inspire many, many other women to continue working and many other men to give them the respect that they deserve like every single human being,"" she said. Prof Duflo's husband was her PhD supervisor and their work, alongside that of Prof Kremer's, has focused on poor communities in India and Africa. Their research helps show which investments are worth making and also what has the biggest impact on the lives of the poorest people. For example, their research in India found a high level of absenteeism among teachers. They found employing them on short-term contracts, which would be extended if they had good results, led to significantly better test results for students. Another project looked at how the demand for de-worming pills for parasitic infections was affected by price. They found that three quarters of parents gave their children these pills when the medicine was free, compared to just 18% when they cost less than a US dollar, which was still heavily subsidised. The research has helped inform decisions on whether medicine and healthcare should be charged for and, if so, at what price. Abhijit Banerjee, Esther Duflo and Michael Kremer Prof Banerjee and Prof Duflo both work at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the US, while Prof Kremer works at Harvard University. ""I didn't think it was possible to win the Nobel Prize in Economics before being significantly older than any of the three of us,"" Prof Duflo said. The trio will receive nine million Swedish krona (Â£728,000). The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said the winners had introduced ""a new approach to obtaining reliable answers about the best ways to fight global poverty"". It said they had broken the complex issue into ""smaller, more manageable questions"" making it easier to tackle. ""As a direct result of one of their studies, more than five million Indian children have benefited from effective programmes of remedial tutoring in school,"" the Academy said. ""Another example is the heavy subsidies for preventive healthcare that have been introduced in many countries."" Ethiopia's Abiy Ahmed wins Nobel Peace Prize The Nobel Prize: Who won what? The Nobel economics prize - technically known as the Sveriges Riksbank Prize - is the only award not created by philanthropist Alfred Nobel. Instead, the economics prize was created by the Swedish central bank ""in memory of Alfred Nobel"" and first awarded in 1969. Last year, William Nordhaus and Paul Romer won the prize for their work on sustainable growth. The US economists' research focused on how climate change and technology have affected the economy. In 2017, US economist Richard Thaler, author of the best seller Nudge, won for his work in behavioural economics. Since it was first awarded in 1969, Americans have dominated the awards.

"US President Donald Trump has repeatedly hit out at what he calls the ""fake news media"" at rallies and on Twitter American media groups have urged the White House to condemn a parody video showing the US president massacring media outlets and political rivals. The White House Correspondents' Association said it was ""horrified"" and urged Mr Trump to denounce the video. It was on shown at an event organised by American Priority, a pro-Trump group. Organisers said the video had been part of a ""meme exhibition"". President Trump's 2020 re-election campaign has disavowed it. Campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh told the BBC on Sunday: ""That video was not produced by the campaign, and we do not condone violence.""

""But based upon everything he has heard, he strongly condemns this video,"" she said. However US media groups demanded that the president personally censure the video, which was played at a Trump resort in Miami, Florida, last week. ""All Americans should condemn this depiction of violence directed toward journalists and the President's political opponents,"" said Jonathan Karl, president of the White House Correspondents' Association. ""We have previously told the President his rhetoric could incite violence."" A pro-Trump creator of viral video, MemeWorld, said the clip had been generated by one of its contributors, by TheGeekzTeam. MemeWorld said in a statement that it did not condone violence. ""The Kingsman video is clearly satirical and the violence depicted is metaphoric,"" said its owner, who goes by the name Carpe Donktum.

The heads of the people he kills have been replaced with the logos of media organisations, including BBC News, CNN and the Washington Post, and political opponents such as Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. The video is a doctored version of scenes from 2014 movie Kingsman: The Secret Service, starring Colin Firth. American Priority also sought to disassociate itself with the video, saying it was ""not approved, seen, or sanctioned"" by event organisers. The video, the group added, was shown in a ""side room"" at the event and was only brought to the attention of organisers by the New York Times. Allow Twitter content?

"The newborn is recovering in hospital A newborn baby girl has been discovered buried alive in northern India, a local police chief has revealed. Abhinandan Singh told reporters the baby was found by a villager who was burying his own daughter, who had died minutes after birth. The baby girl, who had been placed inside an earthen pot about 3ft (90cm) below the ground, was rushed to hospital, where she is recovering. Police have now launched an investigation into the incident. ""We are trying to find the parents of the baby and we suspect that this must have happened with their consent,"" Mr Singh told reporters in the state of Uttar Pradesh. Where are India's millions of missing girls? 'Second life' for Indian baby girl left on the streets to die According to the police chief, the villager found the girl by accident as he dug a grave in a burial ground for his own daughter. ""As they were digging a grave for her, at a depth of three feet, the spade hit an earthen pot, which was pulled out. There was a baby lying in it,"" Mr Singh explained. ""The police took the baby to the city hospital where she is getting treatment."" India's gender ratio is one of the worst in the world. Women are often discriminated against socially and girls are seen as a financial burden, particularly among poor communities. Campaigners say a traditional preference for sons has meant millions of female children lost to foeticide and infanticide over the years. Although most unwanted female foetuses are aborted with help from illegal sex determination clinics, cases of baby girls being killed after birth are not uncommon either.

"Sitting on the Sovereign's Throne, Elizabeth II delivered the 65th Queen's Speech of her reign to Parliament earlier. The speech outlined the government's agenda for the coming parliamentary session, with 26 bills - pieces of proposed legislation - spanning health, education, defence, technology, transport and crime, as well as Brexit. Here's what the Queen's Speech contained, and what it may mean in practice. What the speech said:""My government intends to work towards a new partnership with the European Union, based on free trade and friendly co-operation."" What it means:If Boris Johnson can secure a deal this week - which is backed by MPs - he will then need to pass the European Union Agreement Bill, ratifying it into UK law. Her Majesty also spoke of ""new regimes"" post-Brexit for fisheries, agriculture and trade and a new immigration system. All of these require new laws. What the speech said:""My government is committed to addressing violent crime, and to strengthening public confidence in the criminal justice system."" What it means:Law and order dominated the government's announcements.They included separate bills covering sentencing, foreign national criminals, extradition, serious violence, prisoners and police protections. The extradition bill would create powers to immediately arrest suspected criminals who are in the UK but wanted in other ""trusted"" countries. The sentencing bill would push back the automatic release point for violent and sexual offenders from half-way to two-thirds of the way through a sentence. A Foreign Nationals Offenders Bill would increase the maximum punishment for those who return to the UK in breach of a deportation order. What the speech said:""Proposals on railway reform will be brought forward."" What it means:Ministers are signalling that a new commercial model for the railways will arrive in 2020, replacing the existing franchised system - with more details to be published soon. What the speech said:""New laws will be taken forward to help implement the National Health Service's Long Term Plan in England."" What it means:On top of a renewed commitment to the plan - first published under Theresa May - the government will focus on improving mental health care and will bring in new laws aimed at improving patient safety and increasing the number of clinical trials for new drugs. Health is devolved, so Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have other plans. What the speech said:""My government will bring forward proposals to reform adult social care in England to ensure dignity in old age."" What it means:In the long term, ministers are promising a further consultation - in the form of a green paper - on reforming the existing system. In the shorter term, local authorities could be allowed to increase council tax by an extra 2% to raise Â£500m towards paying for care for the elderly. What the speech said:""For the first time ever, environmental principles will be enshrined into law."" What it means:Recalling especially pollutant vehicles, charges for certain single-use plastics and protecting trees are just some of the measures being considered in a new environment bill. There is also a strong focus on animal welfare, with bills pledged increasing the sentence for animal cruelty. What the speech said:""A white paper will be published to set out my government's ambitions for unleashing regional potential in England, and to enable decisions that affect local people to be made at a local level."" What it means:The government is not committing to specific new laws in this area, but the policy paper is expected to expand the number, powers and funding of local mayors in England. What the speech said:""My Ministers... will bring forward laws to implement new building safety standards."" What it means:With the continuing fall-out from the Grenfell disaster in 2017, ministers plan to put into law a new safety framework for high-rise housing blocks. It would include giving local residents more of a say and putting in place strong significant sanctions for house builders that don't meet the safety standards. The government also plans to pass a new law to secure the compensation scheme for victims of the Windrush scandal. What the speech said on drones:""An aviation bill will provide for the effective and efficient management of the UK's airspace."" What it means:A bill would give police more powers to tackle unlawful use of drones and other model aircraft following last year's high-profile disruption at Gatwick airport. What the speech said on tips:""Take steps to make work fairer, introducing measures that will support those working hard."" What it means:This is a popular measure, welcomed by Labour, that would force employers in England and Wales to distribute all tips to workers without deductions. What the speech said:""My government will take steps to protect the integrity of democracy and the electoral system."" What it means:A new law is being touted which would require people to show photo ID to vote in UK elections. Labour says this is an attempt to ""rig"" the next election, by suppressing turnout among younger and ethnic minority voters. There are four pieces of legislation that were ""carried over"" from the last session. This means the government has decided to carry on from where they left off before prorogation, rather than starting from scratch. The four include the Domestic Abuse Bill, which has cross-party support and started its journey through Parliament at the beginning of October. After six days of debate, MPs will vote on the Queen's Speech and any amendments made by MPs. Boris Johnson, who does not have a majority in the Commons, is at risk of potential defeat. The last PM to lose such a vote was Stanley Baldwin in 1924. Could MP's vote down the Queen's Speech? What is the King's Speech and why is it important? Why are MPs being sent home again?

"This video can not be played PC Andrew Harper's coffin was draped in a police flag The widow of a police officer killed on duty said he was ""gentle giant with a heart of gold"" as she addressed hundreds of people at his funeral. Uniformed colleagues of PC Andrew Harper lined the route as the cortege made its way to the private service at Christ Church Cathedral in Oxford. The 28-year-old died after being dragged under a vehicle on a road near Sulhamstead, Berkshire, on 15 August. His widow Lissie Harper said he ""wore his uniform with pride"". Reading the eulogy, she said: ""You used to tell me we were a team and that we would get through all of life's hurdles together, how I wish you were here with me now. The hardest challenge of all is losing you. ""Keeping everyone safe was your priority, not only in your job but with your family too. Everything was always okay when you were around. ""Although Andrew was strong he was also unfailingly kind, a gentle giant with a heart of gold."" The couple, who were childhood sweethearts and had been together for 13 years, had only been married for four weeks. She added: ""He was my hero and his spirit will live on in my memories forever."" PC Andrew Harper had married his wife Lissie four weeks before his death Earlier members of the public paid their respects as the cortege led by mounted officers travelled through Oxford before the service, which was attended by 800 mourners. The coffin was draped in a navy flag with a police crest on the side and was carried into the cathedral at 11:00 BST by six officers. Leading the service, the Dean of Christ Church the Very Rev Dr Martyn Percy said: ""The tributes that have poured in for Andrew exemplify a truly outstanding young man, but also the very best virtues in policing. ""He represented policing at its best. He was everything you wanted in a police officer. Authentic, brave, genuine, and kind."" Lissie Harper left a symbol of her husband's life during the service Mrs Harper placed her husband's police hat on his coffin, while members of PC Harper's family also laid symbols of his life in front of a large photograph of him inside the cathedral. Songs by Shirley Bassey and Russell Watson were played during the service, in addition to performances from the cathedral's choir. Colleague PC Jordan Johnstone paid tribute to his ""infectious smile and relentless humour"". ""I'm privileged to have worked with you and even more so to call you my friend,"" he added. By BBC News correspondent Helena Wilkinson in Oxford Officers lined the streets as the cortege travelled through Oxford PC Harper had married his childhood sweetheart Lissie just 28 days before he died. Today she, with other family and friends, came to Christ Church Cathedral to say their final goodbye. People who didn't know him came out to pay their respects. Hundreds of officers from PC Harper's force also lined the route. Many looked as young as he was. As the hearse led by officers on horseback passed, silence fell. Officers bowed their heads.

PC Andrew Harper's order of service Today I would like to remember and honour the kind brave and lovely man we all know. We are all here just for you. From the ever sweet, lanky, red faced boy passing me notes in class, to the strong and loyal man you grew to be. I have always known how special you are. We often talked about how lucky we were to have found and kept each other, true childhood sweethearts, loving one another more and more with each passing day. Not a day went past that we didn't say I love you. You used to tell me we were a team and that we would get through all of life's hurdles together, how I wish you were here with me now. The hardest challenge of all is losing you. We managed to pack so many amazing memories into the last 13 years, travelling the world, buying a house and getting married. You had a contagious love for life, filling each day with laughter and appreciating all the little things. You have always been a protector. Whether in your role of big brother, fierce friend, loving husband or keeper of peace among the public, keeping everyone safe was your priority, not only in your job but your family too. Everything was always okay when you were around. Although Andrew was strong he was also unfailingly kind, a gentle giant with a heart of gold. He wore his uniform with pride and vowed to challenge the bad and celebrate the good. He loved to be part of a team and had a work ethic to admire. Looking around me today I know that he was classed so very highly among his peers, known for being proactive, kind and fair.

"Winston Trew said his life fell apart after he served eight months in prison Two men who say they were framed by a detective nearly 50 years ago have had their cases referred to the Court of Appeal. Winston Trew and Sterling Christie were among a group - known as the Oval Four - who were arrested at Oval Tube station in south London in March 1972. They spent eight months in prison for assaulting a police officer and attempted theft. But a review said the appeal would focus on the officer's ""integrity"". The four men, aged between 19 and 23 at the time, were members of a political organisation which represented the interests of black people in London. They were arrested by a police squad investigating crime on the London Underground. Winston Trew forged a career as a university lecturer Plain clothes police officers accused them of ""nicking handbags,"" Mr Trew said. When the officers refused to show identification, at the group's request, an argument ""turned into a big fight"". ""We were given a good hiding there to confess to things we didn't do,"" he said. The operation was led by Det Sgt Derek Ridgewell, who was the key prosecution witness at the men's trial when they were convicted. But the officer's career ended in disgrace in 1980 when he was jailed for seven years for plotting to steal goods from the Royal Mail. He died in prison in 1982. A series of cases has raised further concerns about his honesty, and last year the Court of Appealquashed the conviction of a businessman, Stephen Simmons, after hearing Ridgewell had ""fitted him up"". The Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) said it had now decided to refer the cases of Mr Trew and Mr Christie to the Court of Appeal, although it had failed to trace the other two members of the Oval Four. George Griffiths and Constantine ""Omar"" Boucher, the remaining defendants, are understood to have left the UK in the 1970s. They can separately apply to have their case referred to the Court of Appeal if they choose to. ""The referral is made because the commission considers there is a real possibility that the court will quash the conviction on the basis of new evidence and arguments concerning the integrity of DS Ridgewell,"" it said, adding that the case may have ""potential significance"" for a number of other similar convictions. The British girl who went to meet her death row pen pal Half marathon called off in armed police swoop First black magistrate honoured with plaque Mr Trew, now 69, said he was ""absolutely delighted"" there was to be a fresh appeal, saying his life had been ""shattered"" when he was jailed 47 years ago. ""My wife left me, I lost my confidence, I was a shell of the person I was before,"" he said. Mr Trew, who remarried and forged a career as a university lecturer and author, said he thought every day about what had happened and had ""never given up"" trying to overturn his conviction. ""The police did something wrong, so I'm going to fight the injustice."" The appeal is expected to be heard next year.

"A British man jailed for numerous sex crimes against Malaysian children has been found stabbed to death in prison. Richard Huckle, 33, from Ashford, Kent, abused as many as 200 children. In 2016, he was given 22 life sentences after admitting 71 charges of sex abuse of children aged between six months and 12 years, between 2006 and 2014. It is understood he was attacked on Sunday in his cell at Full Sutton Prison, near York, with what was described as a makeshift knife. Police were called shortly after 12:30pm and have launched an investigation into his death, which they are treating as suspicious. Huckle's trial at the Old Bailey in 2016 heard that investigators who checked his computer found more than 20,000 indecent pictures and videos of his assaults. These were shared with paedophiles worldwide through a hidden website on the so-called dark web. Malaysia abuse Briton gets 22 life terms How Richard Huckle was caught Huckle, who worked as a freelance photographer, tried to make a business out of his abuse by crowd-funding the release of the images. He was compiling a paedophile's manual at the time of his arrest in 2014. At the end of his trial, Judge Peter Rook said Huckle's sentence reflected the ""public abhorrence"" over his ""campaign of rape"". He said: ""It is very rare indeed that a judge has to sentence sexual offending by one person on such a scale as this."" This video can not be played The BBC's Angus Crawford traces the path of Richard Huckle in Kuala Lumpur Huckle was arrested at Gatwick Airport by National Crime Agency officials in December 2014, following a tip-off by Australian authorities. He presented himself as a practising Christian and first visited Malaysia on a teaching gap year when he was 18 or 19. He went on to groom children while doing voluntary work. In online posts, Huckle had bragged: ""Impoverished kids are definitely much easier to seduce than middle-class Western kids."" Commenting on one of his victims, he boasted: ""I'd hit the jackpot, a 3yo girl as loyal to me as my dog and nobody seemed to care."" Huckle's encrypted paedophile manual was found on his laptop ready for publication on the dark web. Last year,BBC Three produced a documentaryabout Huckle, which explored his proximity to children in Cambodia, India and the UK. Malaysians deplore 'devil' Huckle The 'gap year' paedophile Richard Huckle 'highly likely' to have had UK victims In it, retired police officer Jim Gamble, who used to lead child abuse investigations in Britain, called for a more extensive investigation into potential abuses in the UK. Full Sutton is a maximum security men's prison around 11 miles east of York that holds ""some of themost difficult and dangerous criminals in the country,external"", according to the Ministry of Justice website. Residents have protested against plans to expand Full Sutton Paedophile Richard Huckle stabbed to death in jail It has a total capacity of around 550, and holds only Category A prisoners, whose escape would be consideredhighly dangerous,,externaland Category B prisoners, whose escape must be made ""very difficult"". Last August one hundred officers were calledwhen a prisoner went on a rampage, attacking staff and starting a fire. Plans to build a Category C facility alongside the current facilities,making a 1,440-inmate ""mega prison"",have been opposed by Humberside Police, who fear it would increase violent crime within the jail and raise demands on the force.

"This video can not be played What did we learn from the Queen's Speech? The BBC's Helen Catt explains Boris Johnson's government has set out ""ambitious"" policies on crime, health, the environment and Brexit in a Queen's Speech that opposition parties have dismissed as an ""election manifesto"". Plans for tougher sentences for violent offenders and legal targets for cutting plastic pollution are among 26 bills set out at Parliament's State Opening. The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg said it was a ""long shopping list"". But with the PM having no majority, many of the bills may not become law. Our political editor said the PM was keen to focus on ""bread and butter issues"" like investment in schools and the NHS, or coming up with, at long last, a new way of funding care for the elderly. But she said there was no guarantee the legislative programme would be approved by Parliament. If MPs reject it, it will trigger renewed calls for a general election. During a debate in the Commons later on Monday, Mr Johnson said his plans offered ""a new age of opportunity for the whole country"". But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the speech was ""a propaganda exercise"", adding: ""The prime minister promised that this Queen's Speech would dazzle us. On closer inspection, it is nothing more than fool's gold."" MPs will be able to debate the Queen's speech for a further five days, with a different theme for each of them, including the NHS and the economy. All the pomp - but very bizarre circumstances Bill by bill - what does Boris Johnson want to do? Robes, tiaras and fanfare: Inside the Queen's Speech Why didn't the Queen wear her crown? Despite continuing Brexit uncertainty, the government has said it is determined to press ahead with its plans, announcing its intention tohold a Budget on 6 November. Negotiations over the UK's departure,with Mr Johnson trying to secure an agreement that will enable the country to leave by 31 October. The government says if it can strike a deal with the EU, it will introduce a withdrawal agreement bill and aim to secure its passage through Parliament before the Halloween deadline. This video can not be played Queen outlines government's Brexit plan The origins of the current State Opening date back to the 1850s The prime minister's partner, Carrie Symonds, was among those watching Labour described the Queen's Speech as a ""party political broadcast"" This video can not be played A look at the fanfare and formality behind this year's State Opening of Parliament The Queen's Speech is famous for its pageantry - with the monarch arriving at the Palace of Westminster in a carriage procession and delivering her speech from the throne in the House of Lords, flanked by the Prince of Wales. Mr Johnson said his government was focused on ""seizing the opportunities that Brexit present"". The 26 bills include,external: Seven pieces of Brexit-related legislation, including measures to establish new regulatory frameworks for fishing, farming, trade and financial services, and a bill to end freedom of movement and bring in a points-based immigration system from 2021. Seven criminal justice bills, including measures that will increase sentences for about 3,000 serious or violent criminals by ending automatic release at the half-way point, tougher penalties for foreign national offenders who try to return to the UK after being deported, and greater protection for police officers. Domestic violence legislation will also be carried over from the last session. Plans for an independent NHS investigations body with legal powers - the Health Service Safety Investigations Body (HSSIB) - to look into ""serious healthcare incidents"", and a pledge to update the Mental Health Act to reduce the number of detentions. An environment bill to ""enshrine principles in law"" and set legally binding ""improvement targets"" to reduce plastics, cut air pollution, restore biodiversity and improve water quality. A separate animal welfare bill to outlaw trophy hunting. Proposed reforms to the divorce laws to minimise the impact of family breakdown on children, and changes in employment law to require restaurants and cafes to give waiting staff ""all tips"" owed to them. There is also a commitment to reform adult social care in England, although no legislation planned at this stage. New measures will also be brought forward to tackle electoral fraud, including requiring people to show an approved form of ID before voting in general and local elections. A shake-up of the rail franchising system in England is also being proposed to improve service reliability, reduce ""fragmentation"" and introduce a ""greater distance"" between ministers and the day-to-day running of the network. Law and order - what has the PM promised? Could there be an early general election? Mr Johnson said the programme, which includes four bills carried over from the last session, demonstrated Brexit was not the limit of the government's ambitions. He told the Commons: ""At the heart of this speech is an ambitious programme to unite this country with energy, optimism and with the basic common sense of one-nation Conservatism."" But Mr Corbyn criticised a number of the proposals, saying mental health care was ""getting worse and worse"", social care proposals ""offered the same promise after two years of inaction and failure"", and plans for education were ""shockingly weak"". He told MPs: ""There has never been such a farce of a government with a majority of minus 45 and a 100% record of defeat in the House of Commons, setting out a legislative agenda they know cannot be delivered in this Parliament."" Brexit talks continue ahead of crunch summit What is Boris Johnson's Brexit plan? Could no-deal still happen? The SNP's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, focused his criticism on the PM's plans for Brexit, saying the UK had ""entered very dark days"". He said the EU was ""the greatest example of political co-operation and peace - leaving behind the scars of war, the pain of loss, and instead choosing to take the hand of friendship across this continent"" and to leave would be a ""tragedy"". Former Tory cabinet minister Dominic Grieve, who now sits as an independent after rebelling over Brexit, said the PM would find it ""very difficult"" to govern until Brexit was resolved. That was a very long shopping list of things, but the unsaid reality, of course, is that the biggest question hanging over it all is Brexit. The Queen may have said the government's priority is to leave on 31 October, but there's no way anyone in this square mile can be sure that happens. Whether it happens - and how it happens - is a much bigger influence than anything we've just heard being said. In many ways, it's a Queen's Speech from a parallel universe - one in which Boris Johnson gets his way. Where he definitely gets his deal with Brussels by the end of this week, he definitely gets it through Parliament on Saturday and definitely gets all the Brexit legislation passed. It's also a world in which he definitely gets the general election he wants in the next few weeks and then definitely gets a Conservative majority. We shouldn't dismiss this speech - it does mean something, but what it means is this is what we are likely to see as the basis for a Conservative manifesto whenever that election does come.

Although most unwanted female foetuses are aborted with help from illegal sex determination clinics, cases of baby girls being killed after birth are not uncommon either.

"The Budget has been announced for 6 November, with Chancellor Sajid Javid saying it will be ""the first budget after leaving the EU"". ""This is the right and responsible thing to do - we must get on with governing,"" he said. It will be Mr Javid's first Budget since he became chancellor in July. The Budget date is normally announced in September. Mr Javid said the Budget would detail the government's plans to ""shape the economy for the future"". BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said that in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the full Budget would be delayed and the 6 November announcement would be ""a simple economic statement"".

The government's independent financial watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which produces economic forecasts for the Budget would normally get ten weeks notice to prepare. The OBR said it was able to prepare some information in advance, but that its forecasts would be based on the UK securing a Brexit deal. It said since the EU referendum, its forecasts had been based on ""broad brush assumptions for a relatively smooth [Brexit] outcome"". The OBR said that approach would continue ""in the absence of any specific information"". Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said he expected the Budget to be ""an electioneering stunt rather than a Budget to rebuild our stalling economy and reset the direction of our country"". The Budget is the government's yearly announcement on its plans for tax and spending for the coming financial year, which starts in April 2020. There are expectations that the chancellor could relax the government's borrowing rules to give him more spending power. The rules state that borrowing should remain below 2% of national income, at about Â£46bn. Mr Javid has already suggested he is prepared to borrow more to take advantage of current record-low borrowing costs, and has previously said he plans to review the borrowing rules. In August's spending review, Mr Javid declared the government had ""turned the page on austerity, announcing itslargest increase in spending for 15 years. Naming the date of a Budget is a sign from the chancellor to communicate that at least some Treasury business continues as normal. But there is nothing routine about a government yet to win a vote in the Commons, trying to pass a Budget. In theory there will be measures to boost infrastructure, spending and some taxes. But if there is a no-deal Brexit, the Treasury will instead turn its focus on giving immediate support to the economy, businesses and households. So, in that case, there would be a delay to the Budget. In a no-deal scenario, there might be some extra scope for a cut to VAT which could be part of a general fiscal stimulus package for the economy. Whatever happens, a new set of Budget numbers and economic forecasts is being prepared by the government's independent financial watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility. The Bank of England too will be preparing its new forecasts for the 7 November Inflation Report, and any implications for interest rates. The Treasury will also reveal its new self-imposed constraints on borrowing - ""fiscal rules""- designed to help create more space for spending and tax cuts. And if there is a Budget a week after a Brexit deal has passed the Commons, there could be a chance that the government could get support for its fiscal measures too. Or rather it could be part of the pathway to a general election next month.

"This video can not be played PC Andrew Harper's coffin was draped in a police flag The widow of a police officer killed on duty said he was ""gentle giant with a heart of gold"" as she addressed hundreds of people at his funeral. Uniformed colleagues of PC Andrew Harper lined the route as the cortege made its way to the private service at Christ Church Cathedral in Oxford. The 28-year-old died after being dragged under a vehicle on a road near Sulhamstead, Berkshire, on 15 August. His widow Lissie Harper said he ""wore his uniform with pride"". Reading the eulogy, she said: ""You used to tell me we were a team and that we would get through all of life's hurdles together, how I wish you were here with me now. The hardest challenge of all is losing you. ""Keeping everyone safe was your priority, not only in your job but with your family too. Everything was always okay when you were around. ""Although Andrew was strong he was also unfailingly kind, a gentle giant with a heart of gold."" The couple, who were childhood sweethearts and had been together for 13 years, had only been married for four weeks. She added: ""He was my hero and his spirit will live on in my memories forever."" PC Andrew Harper had married his wife Lissie four weeks before his death Earlier members of the public paid their respects as the cortege led by mounted officers travelled through Oxford before the service, which was attended by 800 mourners. The coffin was draped in a navy flag with a police crest on the side and was carried into the cathedral at 11:00 BST by six officers. Leading the service, the Dean of Christ Church the Very Rev Dr Martyn Percy said: ""The tributes that have poured in for Andrew exemplify a truly outstanding young man, but also the very best virtues in policing. ""He represented policing at its best. He was everything you wanted in a police officer. Authentic, brave, genuine, and kind."" Lissie Harper left a symbol of her husband's life during the service Mrs Harper placed her husband's police hat on his coffin, while members of PC Harper's family also laid symbols of his life in front of a large photograph of him inside the cathedral. Songs by Shirley Bassey and Russell Watson were played during the service, in addition to performances from the cathedral's choir. Colleague PC Jordan Johnstone paid tribute to his ""infectious smile and relentless humour"". ""I'm privileged to have worked with you and even more so to call you my friend,"" he added. By BBC News correspondent Helena Wilkinson in Oxford Officers lined the streets as the cortege travelled through Oxford PC Harper had married his childhood sweetheart Lissie just 28 days before he died. Today she, with other family and friends, came to Christ Church Cathedral to say their final goodbye. People who didn't know him came out to pay their respects. Hundreds of officers from PC Harper's force also lined the route. Many looked as young as he was. As the hearse led by officers on horseback passed, silence fell. Officers bowed their heads. Some people in the crowds began to cry. Through the glass of the hearse PC Harper's coffin could be seen draped in a Thames Valley Police flag. A young officer who died while doing his job. A hero to so many. PC Harper, from Wallingford in Oxfordshire, was killed on the A4 Bath Road while investigating a reported break-in. Thames Valley Police Federation chairman Craig O'Leary said PC Harper was ""a hero"" who ""loved being a police officer"". Thousands of bikers to ride in memory of killed PC PC's death inspires kindness from public Three teens charged with PC's murder The force said its flags would be flying at half-mast as a mark of respect to the officer. It added on Twitter: ""Today is going to be a tough day for all our officers, staff and volunteers as we pay tribute to our fallen colleague."" Lissie Harper placed her husband's police hat on his coffin Three teenagers remain in custody charged with murdering PC Harper. Henry Long, 18, from Mortimer in Reading, and two 17-year-old boys, who cannot be named because of their age, are accused of murder and conspiracy to steal a quad bike. Thomas King, 21, from Basingstoke, is also accused of conspiracy to steal a quad bike. Jed Foster was also accused of murderbut prosecutors dropped his charges following further police investigation. PC Andrew Harper's order of service Today I would like to remember and honour the kind brave and lovely man we all know. We are all here just for you. From the ever sweet, lanky, red faced boy passing me notes in class, to the strong and loyal man you grew to be. I have always known how special you are. We often talked about how lucky we were to have found and kept each other, true childhood sweethearts, loving one another more and more with each passing day. Not a day went past that we didn't say I love you. You used to tell me we were a team and that we would get through all of life's hurdles together, how I wish you were here with me now. The hardest challenge of all is losing you. We managed to pack so many amazing memories into the last 13 years, travelling the world, buying a house and getting married. You had a contagious love for life, filling each day with laughter and appreciating all the little things. You have always been a protector. Whether in your role of big brother, fierce friend, loving husband or keeper of peace among the public, keeping everyone safe was your priority, not only in your job but your family too. Everything was always okay when you were around. Although Andrew was strong he was also unfailingly kind, a gentle giant with a heart of gold. He wore his uniform with pride and vowed to challenge the bad and celebrate the good. He loved to be part of a team and had a work ethic to admire. Looking around me today I know that he was classed so very highly among his peers, known for being proactive, kind and fair.

"Sitting on the Sovereign's Throne, Elizabeth II delivered the 65th Queen's Speech of her reign to Parliament earlier. The speech outlined the government's agenda for the coming parliamentary session, with 26 bills - pieces of proposed legislation - spanning health, education, defence, technology, transport and crime, as well as Brexit. Here's what the Queen's Speech contained, and what it may mean in practice. What the speech said:""My government intends to work towards a new partnership with the European Union, based on free trade and friendly co-operation."" What it means:If Boris Johnson can secure a deal this week - which is backed by MPs - he will then need to pass the European Union Agreement Bill, ratifying it into UK law. Her Majesty also spoke of ""new regimes"" post-Brexit for fisheries, agriculture and trade and a new immigration system. All of these require new laws. What the speech said:""My government is committed to addressing violent crime, and to strengthening public confidence in the criminal justice system."" What it means:Law and order dominated the government's announcements.They included separate bills covering sentencing, foreign national criminals, extradition, serious violence, prisoners and police protections. The extradition bill would create powers to immediately arrest suspected criminals who are in the UK but wanted in other ""trusted"" countries. The sentencing bill would push back the automatic release point for violent and sexual offenders from half-way to two-thirds of the way through a sentence. A Foreign Nationals Offenders Bill would increase the maximum punishment for those who return to the UK in breach of a deportation order. What the speech said:""Proposals on railway reform will be brought forward."" What it means:Ministers are signalling that a new commercial model for the railways will arrive in 2020, replacing the existing franchised system - with more details to be published soon. What the speech said:""New laws will be taken forward to help implement the National Health Service's Long Term Plan in England."" What it means:On top of a renewed commitment to the plan - first published under Theresa May - the government will focus on improving mental health care and will bring in new laws aimed at improving patient safety and increasing the number of clinical trials for new drugs. Health is devolved, so Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have other plans. What the speech said:""My government will bring forward proposals to reform adult social care in England to ensure dignity in old age."" What it means:In the long term, ministers are promising a further consultation - in the form of a green paper - on reforming the existing system. In the shorter term, local authorities could be allowed to increase council tax by an extra 2% to raise Â£500m towards paying for care for the elderly. What the speech said:""For the first time ever, environmental principles will be enshrined into law."" What it means:Recalling especially pollutant vehicles, charges for certain single-use plastics and protecting trees are just some of the measures being considered in a new environment bill. There is also a strong focus on animal welfare, with bills pledged increasing the sentence for animal cruelty. What the speech said:""A white paper will be published to set out my government's ambitions for unleashing regional potential in England, and to enable decisions that affect local people to be made at a local level."" What it means:The government is not committing to specific new laws in this area, but the policy paper is expected to expand the number, powers and funding of local mayors in England. What the speech said:""My Ministers... will bring forward laws to implement new building safety standards."" What it means:With the continuing fall-out from the Grenfell disaster in 2017, ministers plan to put into law a new safety framework for high-rise housing blocks. It would include giving local residents more of a say and putting in place strong significant sanctions for house builders that don't meet the safety standards. The government also plans to pass a new law to secure the compensation scheme for victims of the Windrush scandal. What the speech said on drones:""An aviation bill will provide for the effective and efficient management of the UK's airspace."" What it means:A bill would give police more powers to tackle unlawful use of drones and other model aircraft following last year's high-profile disruption at Gatwick airport. What the speech said on tips:""Take steps to make work fairer, introducing measures that will support those working hard."" What it means:This is a popular measure, welcomed by Labour, that would force employers in England and Wales to distribute all tips to workers without deductions. What the speech said:""My government will take steps to protect the integrity of democracy and the electoral system."" What it means:A new law is being touted which would require people to show photo ID to vote in UK elections. Labour says this is an attempt to ""rig"" the next election, by suppressing turnout among younger and ethnic minority voters. There are four pieces of legislation that were ""carried over"" from the last session. This means the government has decided to carry on from where they left off before prorogation, rather than starting from scratch. The four include the Domestic Abuse Bill, which has cross-party support and started its journey through Parliament at the beginning of October. After six days of debate, MPs will vote on the Queen's Speech and any amendments made by MPs. Boris Johnson, who does not have a majority in the Commons, is at risk of potential defeat. The last PM to lose such a vote was Stanley Baldwin in 1924. Could MP's vote down the Queen's Speech? What is the King's Speech and why is it important? Why are MPs being sent home again?

"This video can not be played Atwood and Evaristo become the first authors to jointly win the Booker Prize since 1992 Margaret Atwood and Bernardine Evaristo have been named the joint winners of the 2019 Booker Prize after the judges broke their rules by declaring a tie. Atwood's The Testaments, the Canadian writer's follow-up to The Handmaid's Tale, was recognised alongside Londoner Evaristo's novel Girl, Woman, Other. The pair will split the literary award's Â£50,000 prize money equally. The Booker rules say the prize must not be divided, but the judges insisted they ""couldn't separate"" the two works. Atwood, 79, is the oldest ever Booker winner, while Evaristo is the first black woman to win. After their names were called, the pair stood arm-in-arm on stage and Atwood joked: ""I would have thought I would have been too elderly, and I kind of don't need the attention, so I'm very glad that you're getting some. ""It would have been quite embarrassing for meâ¦ if I had been alone here, so I'm very pleased that you're here too."" Atwood praised Evaristo for encouraging black female writers The award's rules were changed after the last tie in 1992, and organisers told this year's judges they were not allowed to pick two winners. But after five hours of deliberations, Peter Florence, the chair of the judges, said: ""It was our decision to flout the rules."" He told reporters: ""The more we talked about them, the more we found we loved them both so much we wanted them both to win."" Evaristo and Atwood spoke together on Radio 4's Today programme on Tuesday morning. Evaristo said winning was ""a real game changer"", adding: ""It means my work gets out there to a much wider audience around the world. ""There are lots of prizes which people from certain communities don't win, certainly black people don't win lots of literary awards. No one seems to notice, but it's really important. ""A black woman has never won [the Booker before]. Only four black women have ever been shortlisted and there have been about 300 books shortlisted. ""Hopefully this signals a new direction for the Booker and the kind of judges they have. This year there were four women judges and one male. ""I hope more black women win this prize."" Atwood, who is from Ottawa, said: ""It's great to be sharing with Bernardineâ¦ and I certainly hope you'll come to Canada, bring your warm clothing!"" She told Evaristo: ""What you have done is to make it possible for more black women to consider that writing is something they can do."" It is 19 years since Atwood won the Booker for The Blind Assassin, and 33 years since she was nominated for The Handmaid's Tale. With the latter book enjoying newfound popularity and resonance against the backdrop of Donald Trump's America, The Testaments picks up 15 years after the end of that novel. Returning to the totalitarian, patriarchal Gilead, it is narrated by Aunt Lydia, one of the handmaids' instructors, and two teenage girls. Peter Florence said: ""It does massively more than follow the single story that we had from Offred. This is beautiful in its depth and exploration of the world of Gilead. ""As [Atwood] has said, it might have looked like science fiction back in the day, although all of the extremities are rooted in fact. Now it looks more politically urgent than ever before."" Published in September, The Testaments sold more than 100,000 copies in the UK in its first week, making it the fastest-selling hardback novel in four years. Speaking before the ceremony, Atwood said winning would be ""a double-edged sword for me, but for a younger person I think it would be great"". Bernardine Evaristo was born the fourth of eight children, in Woolwich, south east London, to an English mother and a Nigerian father. Her father was a welder and local Labour councillor; her mother was a schoolteacher. She spent her teenage years at Greenwich Young People's Theatre, which was where she first became involved in the arts.. She went on to study at Goldsmiths, University of London, where she earned her PhD in creative writing. A career in theatre followed and she was a co-founder of the Theatre of Black Women company in 1982. She also set up the Spread the Word writer development agency, the Complete Works mentoring scheme for poets of colour and the Brunel International African Poetry Prize. She was made an MBE in 2009 for services to literature. Girl, Woman, Other is 60-year-old Evaristo's eighth novel. It gives a chapter each to the lives of 12 intertwining characters, who are mostly black British women. ""We black British women know that if we don't write ourselves into literature no one else will,""the author has said,external. Lesbian theatre director Amma, non-binary Morgan (formerly Megan), Barbadian bride Winsome and Northumbrian farmer Hattie are among the characters in a book that spans more than 100 years. Peter Florence said there was ""something utterly magical"" about the book's characters, whom he said ""give a wonderful spectrum of black British women today"". ""There are stories there of people who haven't been visibly represented in contemporary literature, and in that sense this book is groundbreaking, and I hope encouraging and inspiring to the rest of the publishing industry."" In her acceptance speech, Evaristo said she hoped it would not be long before another black woman won the prize. ""It's so incredible to share this with Margaret Atwood, who's such a legend and so generous,"" she said. ""A lot of people say, 'I never thought it would happen to me', and I will say I am the first black woman to win this prize, and I hope that honour doesn't last too long. I hope other people come forward now."" She has called Girl, Woman, Other ""a readable experimental novel"". The experimental element mainly comes from the unorthodox punctuation, which often dispenses with quotation marks and capital letters. The Booker Prize rules,externalstate that the prize ""may not be divided or withheld"". The award has been shared twice before - in 1974 and 1992 - but the rules were then changed. ""The thinking was it just doesn't work - it sort of detracts attention from both, rather than drawing attention to either,"" said Gaby Wood, literary director of the Booker Prize Foundation. So when Florence told her the five judges wanted to announce a tie, she said no. The judges got back around the table. Again, they told Wood they wanted two winners. This time, Wood phoned Baroness Kennedy QC, chair of the Booker Prize Foundation, who told her: ""Absolutely not."" The judges deliberated again. ""We tried voting, it didn't work,"" Florence said. ""There's a metaphor for our times. And equally, today of all days, when rebellion is in the air, maybe we were a little moved by that."" The panel resolved to hold firm on their split decision. Baroness Kennedy was called again. ""She said, 'Well, if that's what they've chosen to do, there's nothing we can do,'"" Wood said. ""We had to move on."" Florence added that both winning books ""have urgent things to say"". He told reporters: ""They also happen to be wonderfully compelling, page-turning thrillers, which can speak to the most literary audience, to readers who maybe are only reading one, or in this case I hope two books a year, and can speak at different levels to all sorts of different readerships. ""So in that sense they are, I hope and believe, really valuable Booker Prize winners.""

"Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has said Labour's nationalisation plans would be cost-neutral Labour's nationalisation plans would cost at least Â£196bn, according to the Confederation of British Industry. The employers' group said the up-front cost of taking control of the water and energy utilities, train firms and Royal Mail was equivalent to all income tax paid by UK citizens in a year. It was the combined total of the Â£141bn health budget, and the Â£61bn spent on education, analysis by the CBI said. A Labour Party spokesman said it was ""incoherent scaremongering"" by the CBI. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has said that nationalisation would be cost-neutral as the companies' profits would cover the cost of borrowing needed to finance it. In addition, the party has said that rail nationalisation, for example, would be hugely popular with travellers tired of poor services. And bringing National Grid back under state control would be part of plansto create a National Energy Agencyto help usher in Labour's proposed Green Industrial Revolution. Labour's shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, said the CBI had ""chosen to fabricate false information about Labour's rail policy"" by suggesting that the party was advocating buying rolling stock instead of leasing it. He added: ""The CBI's shoddy research and shabby conduct does a great disservice to our political debate during the hugely challenging times through which we now live."" But a CBI spokesperson said the organisation stood by its analysis, adding: ""The cost of purchasing rolling stock is a fraction of the Â£196bn and was included as that is what full-scale renationalisation of the rail industry would likely involve. ""If a Labour government chose not to purchase the rolling stock, they would still need to pay the cost of leasing them."" In correspondence seen by the BBC, the CBI refused to give a breakdown of its Â£196bn figure. The CBI's report estimated there could be a 10.7% increase in debt from bringing industries back into public ownership. This would raise debt levels to 94% of GDP, the highest point since the 1960s, and would cost about Â£2bn a year, according to the study. It also said that under Labour's plans, savers and pensioners could suffer an estimated Â£9bn loss to their holdings, which translates into Â£327 for every household in the country. The CBI bases its analysis on the nationalisation of: Nine water and sewerage companies and seven water-only companies in England National Grid, and the electricity transmission and distribution networks Rail rolling stock Royal Mail The report said the confidence of international investors in the UK would be ""severely hit"" if Labour refused to pay full market value for the industries. Labour has said nationalisation of energy infrastructure would help create a green revolution Although the analysis said that the state-owned assets would increase in value and there would be potential revenues generated, the study's focus was on costs rather than estimates of potential benefits. Labour cash boost for wind farms and electric cars Labour promises 32-hour working week Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI's chief economist, called the price tag ""eye-watering"". And she said that Â£196bn was only the starting point. ""It doesn't take into account the maintenance and development of the infrastructure, the trickle-down hit to pension pots and savings accounts, or the impact on the country's public finances. ""There are so many other genuine priorities for public spending right now, from investing in our young people to the transition to low carbon economy and connecting our cities and communities. ""These issues are what keep businesses up at night and what they want to see the government get on with addressing. Nationalisation would waste time, energy and public money.""

"Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has said Labour's nationalisation plans would be cost-neutral Labour's nationalisation plans would cost at least Â£196bn, according to the Confederation of British Industry. The employers' group said the up-front cost of taking control of the water and energy utilities, train firms and Royal Mail was equivalent to all income tax paid by UK citizens in a year. It was the combined total of the Â£141bn health budget, and the Â£61bn spent on education, analysis by the CBI said. A Labour Party spokesman said it was ""incoherent scaremongering"" by the CBI. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has said that nationalisation would be cost-neutral as the companies' profits would cover the cost of borrowing needed to finance it. In addition, the party has said that rail nationalisation, for example, would be hugely popular with travellers tired of poor services. And bringing National Grid back under state control would be part of plansto create a National Energy Agencyto help usher in Labour's proposed Green Industrial Revolution. Labour's shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, said the CBI had ""chosen to fabricate false information about Labour's rail policy"" by suggesting that the party was advocating buying rolling stock instead of leasing it. He added: ""The CBI's shoddy research and shabby conduct does a great disservice to our political debate during the hugely challenging times through which we now live."" But a CBI spokesperson said the organisation stood by its analysis, adding: ""The cost of purchasing rolling stock is a fraction of the Â£196bn and was included as that is what full-scale renationalisation of the rail industry would likely involve. ""If a Labour government chose not to purchase the rolling stock, they would still need to pay the cost of leasing them."" In correspondence seen by the BBC, the CBI refused to give a breakdown of its Â£196bn figure. The CBI's report estimated there could be a 10.7% increase in debt from bringing industries back into public ownership. This would raise debt levels to 94% of GDP, the highest point since the 1960s, and would cost about Â£2bn a year, according to the study. It also said that under Labour's plans, savers and pensioners could suffer an estimated Â£9bn loss to their holdings, which translates into Â£327 for every household in the country. The CBI bases its analysis on the nationalisation of: Nine water and sewerage companies and seven water-only companies in England National Grid, and the electricity transmission and distribution networks Rail rolling stock Royal Mail The report said the confidence of international investors in the UK would be ""severely hit"" if Labour refused to pay full market value for the industries. Labour has said nationalisation of energy infrastructure would help create a green revolution Although the analysis said that the state-owned assets would increase in value and there would be potential revenues generated, the study's focus was on costs rather than estimates of potential benefits. Labour cash boost for wind farms and electric cars Labour promises 32-hour working week Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI's chief economist, called the price tag ""eye-watering"". And she said that Â£196bn was only the starting point. ""It doesn't take into account the maintenance and development of the infrastructure, the trickle-down hit to pension pots and savings accounts, or the impact on the country's public finances. ""There are so many other genuine priorities for public spending right now, from investing in our young people to the transition to low carbon economy and connecting our cities and communities. ""These issues are what keep businesses up at night and what they want to see the government get on with addressing. Nationalisation would waste time, energy and public money."" Last week, the Institute for Fiscal Studies suggested that focusing on the upfront cost of Labour's plans was the wrong approach. ""Economically what matters is whether these assets would be better managed by the public or the private sector,"" it said.

"This video can not be played Harry Dunn's mother Charlotte spoke to the BBC while on a plane to the US The parents of Harry Dunn say they are hopeful about meeting the US diplomat's wife who was involved in the crash that killed their son. The 19-year-old motorcyclist died in the crash near RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire on 27 August. Anne Sacoolas left the UK under diplomatic immunity while police were investigating her as a suspect. Mr Dunn's mother, Charlotte Charles, told the BBC they were stepping in the right direction towards a meeting. Speaking on a plane to the US, where she hopes to publicise the case, she said: ""The statement from [Mrs Sacoolas's] lawyer is promising, that we may be able to hopefully get a meeting put together. ""Whether it's face-to-face or lawyer-to-lawyer, we're not really sure yet, but fingers crossed we're stepping in the right direction."" Harry Dunn died in hospital after his motorbike was involved in a crash with a Volvo Mrs Sacoolas - who is reportedly married to a US intelligence official - said in a letter from her lawyers she was ""devastated by the tragic accident"" and extended her ""deepest sympathies"" to Mr Dunn's family. Ms Charles told Sky News earlier that ""sorry doesn't cut it"" but she would not be aggressive if they were to meet. Anne Sacoolas pictured on her wedding day in 2003 The Foreign Office said Mrs Sacoolas had diplomatic immunity following the crash, but it no longer applied.  On Saturday, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab wrote to Mr Dunn's family to explain that the British and US governments now considered Mrs Sacoolas's immunity irrelevant. Ms Charles said receiving the letter was ""amazing"" and described it as a ""breakthrough"". Mr Dunn's father, Tim Dunn, said he was ""shocked, but hopeful something can come of this"". Home Secretary Priti Patel told The Andrew Marr Show earlier the situation had moved on over the last 24 hours and it was ""right"" that ""co-operation takes place"". ""It is right that justice is served, that an investigation takes place, and that Anne Sacoolas actually does co-operate with investigation,"" she said. Priti Patel said it was ""right"" that ""co-operation takes place"" Northamptonshire Police said it was liaising with the Foreign Office and International Crime Co-ordination Centre about what to do next. In a statement, it said it was ""absolutely committed"" to achieving justice for the teenager and his family. A statement issued on behalf of Mrs Sacoolas, whose husband worked at RAF Croughton near the scene of the crash, said she had ""fully co-operated with the police"". It added: ""She spoke with authorities at the scene of the accident and met with the Northampton police at her home the following day. She will continue to co-operate with the investigation. ""Anne would like to meet with Mr Dunn's parents so that she can express her deepest sympathies and apologies for this tragic accident."" This video can not be played Donald Trump described the 19-year-old's death as a ""terrible accident"" About 23,000 individuals in the UK have diplomatic immunity, a status reserved for foreign diplomats and their families, as long as they do not have British citizenship. It means that, in theory, they cannot face court proceedings for any crime or civil case. However, where crimes are committed, the Foreign Office can ask a foreign government to waive immunity. Diplomatic immunity is by no means restricted to those named on the Diplomatic List. Drivers, cooks and other support staff who have been accredited to Britain (""the receiving state"") have the same diplomatic status and immunity. Read more on the Harry Dunn crash Charlotte Charles and Tim Dunn, with Radd Seiger (centre), who hope to visit New York and Washington DC during their trip Mr Dunn's parents have previously said they are considering civil action against Mrs Sacoolas. The family's spokesman Radd Seiger said they would be ""engaging with the media and politicians as they reach out for support from all Americans and to ask them to put pressure on the US administration to do the right thing"". Harry Dunn's Kawasaki motorcycle was involved in a crash with a Volvo near RAF Croughton in August On Friday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the US was ""absolutely ruthless"" in its safeguarding of Mrs Sacoolas following the decision to grant her diplomatic immunity. He said although President Donald Trump was sympathetic towards Mr Dunn's family, the US was ""very reluctant"" to allow citizens to be tried abroad. Mr Raab said now that neither government deemed Mrs Sacoolas's immunity relevant, the matter was ""in the hands"" of Northamptonshire Police and the Crown Prosecution Service. The police force previously said CCTV of the crash in which Mr Dunn died shows a Volvo travelling on the wrong side of the road.
