"This video can not be played Mourinho selects youngsters who are 'not ready' Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho says some of the club's young players ""are not ready"" for first-team action. Mourinho has named eight players who could make their debuts in his squad for Sunday's last Premier League game of the season against Crystal Palace. ""To play so many kids at the same time, honestly, I don't think is good. You want them to be surrounded by players who support them,"" said the Portuguese. United are guaranteed sixth place, while Palace are safe from relegation. Sam Allardyce's side are 13th going into the match at Old Trafford (15:00 BST kick-off), but a victory and other results going their way could see them finish as high as 11th. Mourinho's side face Ajax in the Europa League final in Stockholm on Wednesday knowing victory will earn them a place in the group stages of next season's Champions League. Midfielder Angel Gomes (left) become the youngest winner of the Manchester United youth team Player of the Year award Goalkeepers:Kieran O'Hara (21), Joel Castro Pereira (20). Defender:Demetri Mitchell (20). Midfielders:Zachary Dearnley (19), Angel Gomes (16), Josh Harrop (21), Scott McTominay (20), Matthew Willock (20). In addition, striker Marcus Rashford, who has 11 goals this season, defender Timothy Fosu-Mensah, who has played 10 times this season, and Axel Tuanzebe, who has played four times, should be in the United squad on Sunday. All three are 19. United have already won the EFL Cup this season, and Mourinho's team selection has Wednesday's Europa League final in mind. Mourinho said Paul Pogba - the world's most expensive player - will play on Sunday having missed the past two games after the death of his father, while fellow midfielder Marouane Fellaini will have a scan on a hamstring injury. Meanwhile, captain Wayne Rooney - who has been linked with a summer transfer - may have missed the chance of an Old Trafford farewell, as Mourinho said the England international would ""probably not"" be involved. ""It's a great experience for the kids but they are not ready. Maybe one at a time but not all together,"" added the former Chelsea manager. ""I spoke with [Under-23 coach] Nicky Butt and his opinion is important. When they played at Old Trafford, I have been there. They trained with me many times. I know the kids. ""We bring the ones who are more adapted to our team at the moment. Our biggest problem is the number of matches. It is unbelievable.""

"Stan Kroenke has a 67% stake in Arsenal Arsenal majority shareholder Stan Kroenke is committed to the club in the long term, sources have told the BBC. Kroenke has shown no interest ina Â£1bn bidby Uzbek-born Russian Alisher Usmanov to take full control of the Gunners. It is understood the American's ambition is to win the Premier League and make Arsenal a force in Europe.

""Something has to change, whether it is the manager Arsene Wenger or whether it is the board upstairs."" Arsenal need other teams to slip up in Sunday's final round of matches to avoid missing out on Champions League qualification for the first time in 21 years. Wenger, who has been manager since 1996, has been the target of protests from some of the club's fans. The 67-year-old Frenchman's future at the clubwill be decidedat a board meeting after Arsenal meet Chelsea in the FA Cup final on 27 May. This video can not be played Wenger future to be revealed after cup final ""It is not looking good for Arsenal at the moment,"" Wright told 5 live's Friday Football Social. ""They may be out of the Champions League - something they are not used to - and they have to beat one of the best Chelsea sides I have seen for a long time in the FA Cup final to try and get something from the season. ""Where are they going to sign players from? Who is going to want to come to Arsenal instead of anywhere else in London? At the moment, they are not an attractive proposition. ""We are already missing out on the managers we are supposedly interested in and we are going to start missing out on the kind of players that are going to be available and want to play in the Premier League. ""Top players may want to leave. Too much is up in the air. ""Something has got to happen for Arsenal to go to that next level. This bid will galvanise the fans.""

Usmanovsaid in April,externalthat Kroenke must ""bear huge responsibility"" for the club's failures on the pitch. The Gunners' London rivals Chelsea won the Premier League this season - the fifth time they have done so under the ownership of billionaire Roman Abramovich, who has spent heavily since taking control in 2003. ""Abramovich is a winner,"" added Wright, who scored 185 goals in 288 appearances for Arsenal. ""Stan Kroenke sees it as another asset. If you look at all his other franchises, they are doing the same. They are mediocre, with poor attendances and aren't achieving anything as a team. That is where Arsenal are at the moment.

"Pippa Middleton's engagement ring cost a reported Â£250,000, and the glass wedding marquee an estimated Â£65,000-Â£100,000 When Pippa Middleton marries James Matthews on Saturday every feature of the day will be realised in exquisite detail, with no expense spared. But is Pippa out of step with the times? While a glass marquee might be nice for some, her fellow millennial brides are turning their backs on horse-drawn carriages in favour of homemade decorations and a few drinks at the local pub. Costing somewhere between a new car and a house deposit, the average wedding day in 2016spiralled to an average of Â£27,000 outside Londonand Â£38,000 inside the capital, according to wedding planning site Bridebook. But some couples are only spending a fraction of that amount, and say their day is just as special. Bride Katherine Varley wore a Â£40 dress to marry husband Josh at Wandsworth Town Hall Katherine Varley, 33, married husband Josh, 31, in a dress she bought for Â£40 from Brixton market. The couple met at the primary school where they worked. With Josh on a working holiday visa from Australia, to avoid being apart they were married six months later on a budget of Â£5,000. After their private ceremony at Wandsworth Town Hall in south-west London, they threw a party at the Dukes Head Pub in nearby Putney, with 70 guests. To keep costs low, the couple enlisted friends and family to help with their big day. A family friend baked their wedding cake while Katherine's cousin did their photography. Another friend bought the flowers in bulk from New Covent Garden Market, while the couple made their own invitations and thank you cards. ""I have witnessed close friends planning large weddings with much greater budgets and it has shocked me by how carried away it can get financially. They have all been stunning and truly wonderful days but when you compare those budgets to potentially being deposits towards buying a home, it seems unnecessary,"" says Katherine. Katherine changed outfit for the big party that she and Josh threw after their wedding ceremony The average cost of a wedding dress has fallen 25% year-on-year, according to online fashion retailer Lyst, from Â£1,329 to a still-not-insignificant Â£832. Engagement rings - which according to convention should cost between one and three months' salary - have seen spending fall to Â£1,080, an average of 19% less than a decade ago, according to insurer Protect Your Bubble. Pippa's sister Kate may have driven the trend for coloured stones rather than a traditional diamond, thanks to her famous sapphire engagement ring. Meanwhile, 2017 has become the year of the High Street wedding dress. Whistles, Asos, Topshop and Dorothy Perkins have all launched bridal ranges this year, joining the likes of Phase Eight and Monsoon. Karen Whybrow, owner of vintage and bohemian bridal boutique Rock the Frock, thinks couples are dispensing with tradition to throw a wedding that reflects their personalities - and doesn't cost them their house deposit. ""In the six years I have been in the industry things have changed massively. Brides have become much more individual in their tastes - they don't want the traditional anymore. It's been led by the desire to have something a bit more personal, now that DIY weddings have become a lot more popular."" James Veitch gets creative making decorative jars for his wedding She also notes that brides no longer expect their parents to foot the bill. ""A lot more brides now tend to pay for their dresses themselves. Their mum or dad might pay when they were in their early 20s, but now our brides are usually in their late 20s to early 30s and they have their own careers."" Imogen Veitch, 27, spent just Â£200 on her wedding outfit, buying a wedding dress from China on eBay. She and husband James also went down the DIY route to keep their wedding within a strict Â£6,000 budget. The pair made all of the wedding decorations themselves and created their own floral centrepieces. They married at Sandy Balls holiday park in Hampshire at a cost of Â£4,000. Imogen and James on their wedding day ""We knew we had limited savings and didn't want it all to go on one day,"" says Imogen. ""We aren't extravagant people, so if we had an extravagant wedding it would have felt forced and uncomfortable. Both of us have said we honestly wouldn't change a single thing about our wedding day. It was the best day our lives. ""As it is socially accepted that weddings are expensive I think lots of couples just bite the bullet and go all out, some even taking out loans. And if you are spending Â£20,000 or more on a wedding I can see how people get so stressed out. You need everything to go perfectly or it seems a waste of money. But I can say we were honestly stress-free for the entire planning process and on the day."" While these couples say they would not have changed a thing, for those with more cash to play with a wedding is their chance to realise some more extravagant ideas. Daisy Peirce, 28, effectively had two weddings when she married husband Dan, one in the day at Childerley Hall in Cambridgeshire with 60 guests, and then an evening reception at her parents' home with a further 80. She estimates the combined cost was around Â£50,000. ""We didn't have any budget. We were fortunate that our parents were paying for the wedding so if we wanted to do something, we could,"" Daisy says. Having a big girly wedding wasn't on the agenda. Instead, food was a big focal point of the day for the couple, who both work in catering. Their evening reception included a street food market, with six different trucks offering everything from fish and chips to ice cream and crepes. ""The ceremony was a bit of a blur but I wouldn't change anything,"" says Daisy. ""There were things we definitely wanted to include and we didn't have to sacrifice anything so it definitely took the pressure off."" As part of the ""experience generation"", even the wealthiest young brides and grooms don't want their day to be all about spectacle, says Sarah Haywood. As one of the world's most influential wedding planners, her international clientele include aristocrats and ""people of note"" for whom she has booked headline acts such as Mariah Carey and Jennifer Lopez. ""The millennial generation are certainly far more concerned with the guest experience than they are with showing off, which is a wonderful change to how it was 10 years ago. They are very concerned about the food and drink and the flow of the event, which is as important to them as what it all looks like.""

"Trump is set for his first foreign trip, after a honeymoon period hunkered down at home Before Donald Trump became president he would often spend days holed up in Trump Tower in New York, shuttling in a private elevator between his penthouse apartment and office. And it's been a similar story since he moved into the White House, where he divides his time between the East and West Wings, leaving only to spend weekends at Trump-branded resorts. As a candidate he foreshadowed a homebody presidency - touting himself as the ""America First"" leader who would shun foreign travel to fix the ""carnage"" in the US. But now he's on his way to Saudi Arabia, to Israel, to Rome, to Brussels and Sicily, with a hugely ambitious agenda. The two things are not at odds, HR McMaster, the president's National Security Adviser, told me. ""President Trump understands that America First does not mean American alone,"" he said. ""To the contrary, prioritising American interests means strengthening alliances and partnerships that help us extend our influence and improve the security of the American people."" Youth hold their prayer shawls as they stand in front of the Western Wall, Judaism's holiest prayers site in Jerusalem's Old City Mr Trump will visit the centres of the Muslim, Jewish and Christian faiths on this trip - a first for any president. So how can he avoid the pitfalls that have befallen his interactions at home? General Wesley Clark, the former Supreme Allied Commander of Nato, had a few tips for a president who struggles to grasp foreign policy and stay on-message. Find out which foreign leaders President Trump has met or called since taking office, as well as the countries he has mentioned in his tweets. What has Trump said about your country? ""Say the right things, don't say the wrong things, and maintain composure,"" he says. ""Some unexpected things are likely to happen, keep discipline, have the right frame of reference when you talk and say as little as possible when you don't know things."" Among the foreign-policy goals Mr Trump has set himself, the most ambitious is bringing peace to the Middle East - a geo-political conundrum that has stymied far more experienced presidents than this one. But he seems to be confident. ""It's something that I think is frankly maybe not as difficult as people have thought over the years,"" he said during a recent meeting with Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas. I asked Mr Trump's British-educated counter-terrorism adviser Sebastian Gorka whether the celebrity real-estate mogul-turned-president had the right qualifications for such a task. ""We have in the commander-in-chief, in the president, truly the master of the deal,"" he said. ""This is a man who spent 50 years negotiating - if there's anyone who can bring stability and peace it is Donald Trump."" More on the Trump presidency How powerful is the special counsel? Historians list worse-treated politicians Trump supporters defensive amid Comey claims So on the one hand you have a deal over the price of a piece of real estate in New York. On the other, intractable disputes that go back thousands of years over the right of return of refugees, final status for Jerusalem, whether to negotiate with Hamas, and on. ""I don't think it's not just a question of doing real estate deals,"" said Mr Gorka. ""This is a man who didn't just do deals, he was monumentally successful in the hardest market in the world - Manhattan real estate. And at the end of the day, deals are about human beings."" In reality, Mr Trump might find the Middle East a harder market than New York. But even if he falls short of fixing the Middle East, the president's first foreign trip could serve as a welcome distraction from his woes at home. There will likely be a warm reception waiting for him in Israel and Saudi Arabia, where he has two key things going for him: he isn't Barack Obama, who was widely disliked there by the end of his presidency, and he has taken a hard line on Iran. Families of Palestinians imprisoned in Israeli jails demonstrate in Jerusalem as hundreds of the detainees entered the second month of a hunger strike. The trip might also allow Mr Trump to divert the narrative from the Russia scandal, said Ron Christie, a Republican strategist who served in the Bush White House. ""The minute that he leaves the United States on that plane the entire focus would be what's going on abroad - what the president says and how he acts, as opposed to some of the domestic issues that are dogging him here at home. ""This is a good opportunity for him to turn the page and get a fresh start."" And if anyone needs a fresh start it's Donald Trump. The way the first 120 days of his presidency have gone, he might just find the warm air of Saudi Arabia and Israel a refreshing break from the fetid swamp of Washington DC.

"Labour is crying foul this morning. The Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell says he's angry the Conservatives haven't given out full costings for their manifesto. Labour of course, did show us their sums at their launch earlier in the week, and they are on the warpath. The Tories are vulnerable to claims their plans would hit millions of people, because they will not give out the details of how their plans would actually work. At-a-glance: Conservative manifesto Election 2017: Live updates Parties clash with UKIP in live debate On the winter fuel allowance, for example, experts like the Resolution Foundation believe the only realistic way to introduce means testing is to limit the benefit to pensioners who get pensions credit. To do otherwise would be an administrative palaver, would create costs and would only give limited savings. But use that system, and five out of six pensioners would lose out, which translates to 10 million people - yes, you read that right, 10 million. In that scenario, only people entitled to pension credit would keep the benefit - those with a family income of less than Â£159.35 a week if they're on their own, or Â£243.45 for couples. Tory sources suggest that is not the intention at all, that they will create a new means test instead, implying that the numbers won't be as large. But they won't give any more detail than that; the plan is instead to produce a draft version of the new rules, a Green Paper, if they win, and then consult on the best way to do it. Without being specific of course, they do leave themselves open to suspicions about their true intentions. The same is true on their plans for social care. How many more people will be asked to pay? How exactly will the proposed system work? They are making big promises but again the plan is to produce a Green Paper if they win, then work it out. Again, on immigration there are questions about detail - ministerswon't put a timetableon when they think they will actually (finally) get net migration down to the tens of thousands. It is not unusual not to produce detailed breakdowns of every policy cost in manifestos. They are broad contracts with the electorate, and no politician wants to set themselves too many tests that are impossible to pass later. Labour is often under more pressure to show their numbers because, traditionally, they are considered to be behind on economic credibility. I remember the Greens, too, in the last election, going to huge efforts to show they were a serious force to be reckoned with by publishing their numbers and an independent audit alongside. That didn't save Natalie Bennett, the then leader, from quite an awkward moment when we asked her how she planned to spend one billion pounds on 'The Earth', as their spreadsheet suggested. But some of Theresa May's plans have plenty of blanks to be filled in. And if the Tories won't, then others will and questions will keep being posed. Just as George Osborne was asked again, and again, and again, in the last election about how on earth he would make Â£12bn of welfare cuts, the Tories will keep getting asked this time round exactly what their plans will be. This morning, David Davis said that numbers doing the rounds this morning were just ""guesswork"". But that is exactly the issue  - for as long as they don't give the full details, the guessing will go on. PS:On where the numbers end up on winter fuel allowance, if the Tories win, one of the most interesting things is that Theresa May would be dipping her toe in challenging the gap between young and old. In the last few years, pensioner incomes have been continually protected, many would argue at the expense of the younger generation. Part of this manifesto seeks to start to reverse that, which is a fundamental shift. The former Treasury adviser and well respected policy wonk Torsten Bell has explored that a bithere,external.

"Electroconvulsive therapy - in which a small electric current is passed through the brain causing a seizure - is now used much less often than it was in the middle of the last century. But controversially it is now being used in the US and some other countries as a treatment for children who exhibit severe, self-injuring behaviour. Seventeen-year-old Jonah Lutz is severely autistic. He's also prone to outbursts of violent behaviour, in which he sometimes hits himself repeatedly. His mother, Amy, is convinced that if it wasn't for electroconvulsive therapy - ECT - he would now have to be permanently institutionalised for his own safety, and the safety of those around him. The use of ECT featured famously in the 1975 Hollywood movie, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, starring Jack Nicholson. Set in a mental institution, the Oscar-winning film cemented most people's view of ECT as barbaric. But Amy describes the modern version of the therapy as little short of miraculous. ""ECT has been transformative for Jonah's life and for our life,"" she says. ""We went for a period of time - for years and years - where Jonah was raging, often multiple times a day, ferociously. The only reason he's able to be at home with us, is because of ECT."" It's estimated that one in 10 severely autistic children like Jonah violently attack themselves, often causing serious injuries ranging from broken noses to detached retinas. No-one really knows why. Some theories link self-injuring behaviour to anxiety caused by an overload of sensory signals, others to frustration as the autistic child struggles to communicate. Amy and husband Andy tried countless traditional treatments using medication or behavioural therapy before finally turning to ECT - a treatment that first began to be used on children like Jonah a decade ago, in parts of the US. Each session alleviates his symptoms for up to 10 days at a time - but it's not a cure. Jonah's doctor, Charles Kellner, ECT director at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, is so convinced it's effective and safe that he allows Amy to witness the procedure and the BBC to film it. Prof Kellner says the best way to overcome the negative image of ECT portrayed in popular culture is ""to show people what modern ECT is really like, and show them the results with patients like Jonah"". Jonah is one of a few hundred children in the US to receive the controversial treatment. He has had about 260 ECT sessions since the age of 11. ""There's a lot of interesting new neural imaging research showing that ECT actually reverses some of the brain problems in the major psychiatric illnesses,"" Kellner explains, as he makes final checks on the wiring around Jonah's temples. ""We don't know exactly why it works in people with autism and superimposed mood disorders, but we think it probably reregulates the circuits in the brain that are deregulated because of autism."" The modern treatment is carried out under general anaesthetic, with muscle relaxants to prevent violent convulsions. At the flick of a switch, Kellner administers just under an amp of electric current in a series of very short pulses. Jonah's body begins to shake as the current induces a seizure - ECT specialists think this may ""reset"" the malfunctioning brain. The convulsions last for about 30 seconds. Amy is unperturbed by what she sees. ""If a doctor says they need to cut open your child's chest to conduct life-saving surgery, you would allow it. That is more barbaric yet we accept it,"" she says. Within an hour Jonah is fully alert. He and his mother head out of the hospital and on to the New York street to find an ice cream parlour.

The UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence doesn't recommend ECT for use on under 18s. But ECT is a well-established treatment in adults for severe, often life-threatening depression. Its use is controversial, though, with memory loss the main acknowledged side-effect. What's disputed is the scale of the memory loss. Studies carried out by ECT doctors suggest lapses are mostly short-term and that memory function soon returns to normal. But opponents of ECT cite surveys claiming to show that more than half of patients suffer serious long-term memory loss. ""It's a traumatic brain injury,"" says Dr Peter Breggin, a psychiatrist who has long fought the psychiatric establishment, and campaigns for a total ban on ECT. ""The electricity not only travels through the frontal lobes - that's the seat of intelligence, and thoughtfulness and creativity and judgment - it also goes through the temporal lobes - the seat of memory. You are damaging the very expression of the personality, the character, the individuality, and even, if you believe in it, the expression of the soul."" For former US Army intelligence officer Chad Calvaresi and his wife Kaci, the potential benefits of ECT far outweigh the risks for their 11-year-old, violently autistic daughter, Sofija. ""When she was aggressing towards me, my instinct as a mom was to grab her and hold her and hug her and wait,"" Kaci explains. ""But she got so big and strong that I couldn't do that."" Sofija spent much of her early life suffering neglect and abuse in a Serbian orphanage, before Chad and Kaci adopted her in 2009. They were determined to give her a better life in America, but in 2016 they suffered the heartbreak of institutionalising her again - this time for her own safety. ""She beat herself so bad her nose was busted and bleeding, her lips were busted open and bleeding,"" Chad explains. ""She gave herself a black eye. I was scared of my own daughter."" For six months Sofija received medication and therapy as an in-patient at the renowned Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore, but there was little improvement. During her frequent violent episodes it often took three highly trained care staff - all wearing protective clothing and shielding Sofija with padded mats - to prevent her injuring herself or others. After exhausting all other options, Sofija's doctors finally agreed to Chad and Kaci's request to give her ECT. Just a month later her behaviour had improved enough for her to return home. We caught up with the family after six months and more than 30 treatments, and the transformation was remarkable. Sofija was swimming in the family pool and playing with her siblings, and while her violent episodes hadn't disappeared completely, her parents felt they were less intense and more manageable. Sofija was also receiving home schooling in maths and English. ""She's sharp as a tack,"" says Kaci. ""The only memory loss that Sofija has had from ECT is she forgets the procedure has actually happened."" ECT for severely self-injuring autistic children like Sofija is still in very limited use, and without a long-term scientific study it remains highly controversial. But even though Sofija is likely to need ECT every week for the foreseeable future, her parents have no regrets - they have their daughter back home. ""It's overwhelming if I think about it,"" says Kaci, ""but what future did she have without it? My hope is she doesn't need it for the rest of her life but at this point I see it like a diabetic needing insulin. It keeps her alive. Literally it keeps her alive and it makes it possible for us to be able to have her in our home living life with our family and enjoying Sofija."" Sofija enjoys a maths lesson at home For and against ECT The Royal College of Psychiatrists says ECT is a ""safe and effective treatment for severe depression"" in adults but acknowledgeson its website,externalthat some dispute this: For Many doctors and nurses will say that they have seen ECT relieve very severe depressive illnesses when other treatments have failed. Bearing in mind that 15% of people with severe depression will kill themselves, they feel that ECT has saved patients' lives, and therefore the overall benefits are greater than the risks. Some people who have had ECT will agree, and may even ask for it if they find themselves becoming depressed again. Against Some see ECT as a treatment that belongs to the past. They say that the side-effects are severe and that psychiatrists have, either accidentally or deliberately, ignored how severe they can be. They say that ECT permanently damages both the brain and the mind, and if it does work at all, does so in a way that is ultimately harmful for the patient. Some would want to see it banned.

"Whitehall officials say NHS financial performance data should be delayed because of purdah rules The publication of budget deficits run up by NHS trusts in England islikely to be delayeduntil after the general election because of so-called purdah rules. But what is the purdah convention and why is it controversial? Purdah refers to the pre-election period where restrictions are imposed on the civil service. The rules seek to ensure that announcements and activities by public bodies do not influence the election - by putting out a stream of ""good"" news for example. Purdah also restricts policy and big announcements from Whitehall, which a future government may take a different view on. For this general election the rules kicked in from midnight on 21 April 2017. Two years ago at the last election the head of the civil service,Sir Jeremy Heywood,external, explained that though the business of government continued in a normal way during a campaign, there were challenges. He said: ""We should do everything possible to avoid any activity that could call our political impartiality into question and to ensure that public resources are not used for party-political purposes."" Aguidance document,externalfor the 400,000 civil servants was published by the Cabinet Office on 20 April. It sets out what is allowed and not allowed during the campaign. It is up to the individual government departments to implement the purdah rules. The word itself is Persian in origin and means veil or hidden away. Dr Catherine Haddon, from the Institute for Government think tank, says parliamentary references to purdah rules date back to the late 19th Century - where ministers used the cover of purdah for not answering certain questions about the forthcoming Budget. While the rules are designed to stop the government from putting out a stream of ""good news"" stories, critics argue purdah can also be used to suppress ""bad news"". Last month the governmentlost a case at the high court. It had argued that publishing its air pollution strategy would fall foul of purdah rules, but the court disagreed. Purdah was also under scrutiny during the Scottish and EU referendums regarding the role of the civil service in supporting the government. But ultimately, as Dr Haddon observes: ""The guidance still relies heavily on convention and interpretation."" As such, purdah is likely to remain a source of controversy.

"Princess Mako is getting married, but the law says she must lose her royal title When the Japanese emperor's granddaughter marries law firm employee Kei Komuro next year, her life will undergo a dramatic change. Princess Mako, 25, will lose her title and leave the cloistered imperial household to live with her husband in the outside world. She will receive a one-off payment, after which the couple will be expected to provide for themselves. She will vote and pay tax, shop and do her own chores. If the couple have children, they will not be royal. But her departure means one fewer to carry out official duties. It is also reigniting debate about the shrinking monarchy, the role women play in it and future succession. Emperor Akihito, 83, has already indicated that he wants to step down. As the female royals get married, the monarchy is expected to contract further. There is only one boy among the younger royals, 10-year-old Prince Hisahito. If nothing changes, the future of the imperial institution will rest solely with him. ""If you think about it there is a possibility that all but Prince Hisahito will leave the royal household in 10 to 15 years time,"" said Isao Tokoro, professor emeritus at Kyoto Sangyo University. ""I think it [the engagement] gave us an opportunity to think about the problem. The system should be reformed urgently so we don't lose more members from the Imperial family."" Under Japan'sImperial Household Law,externalof 1947, princesses who marry commoners are removed from the royal family. That same law slashed the number of Japanese royals, removing 11 out of 12 branches of the imperial family as a cost-cutting measure. That means there are no royal males for current princesses to marry. The emperor is a constitutional monarch and Japan's ceremonial head of state. He is a highly symbolic figure in Japan's Shinto religion Current Emperor Akihito is preparing to abdicate in favour of his eldest son, Crown Prince Naruhito Only men can inherit the throne. Japan experienced a succession crisis from the late 1990s until 2006, because both the emperor's sons had daughters only. This was ended by the birth of Prince Hisahito The royal family are not independently wealthy - most of their assets were confiscated after World War Two and they are now funded by the government Japan 'considering 2018 abdication date' Ten things about Japan's emperor Emperor Hirohito's daughters lost their titles under the legislation, as did the current crown prince's sister, Sayako, when she married urban planner Yoshiki Kuroda in 2005. Her transition from closeted princess to commoner attracted considerable attention. Reports described how she learned to drive and practised shopping independently ahead of her wedding. The couple used her lump-sum payment (reportedly $1.3m; Â£1m) to buy a house and she is now a high priestess of the Ise Grand Shrine. So far Princess Mako's engagement has not been officially announced. But the young woman seems well-equipped for her new status, with two spells of independent living under her belt. While studying at Tokyo's International Christian University, she spent nine months as an exchange student at Edinburgh University in 2012-13. A year later, she lived in halls of residence at Leicester University as she completed her Master's in Art Museum and Gallery Studies. She is currently a researcher at a museum in Tokyo and is studying for her doctorate. ""Princess Mako has been the embodiment of an Imperial family member who is close to the public,"" the Yomiuri newspapersaid in an editorial.,external""Being an amiable person, she will surely build a cheerful home."" But she will be missed. According tothe Asahi newspaper,external, Princess Mako is currently patron of two organisations, has travelled overseas as a representative of the royal family and has attended important imperial functions. Her official duties must now be shared among a dwindling pool of royals. At the moment there are 19 members of the royal family. Seven are unmarried women who must leave when they wed. Eleven (four couples and three widows) are over 50. That leaves Prince Hisahito. He is the youngest of four males in line to the throne. Three of them - Crown Prince Naruhito, his brother Prince Akishino (Fumihito) and Prince Hitachi (Masahito), the current emperor's younger brother, are highly unlikely to have more children. That could potentially leave Prince Hisahito (and whatever family he might go on to have) with sole responsibility for performing official duties and continuing the imperial line. Prince Hisahito, pictured with his parents on his first day at school in April 2013, is the youngest heir to the throne At the moment, a law allowing Emperor Akihito to abdicate is being prepared. In its editorial, the Yomiuri newspaper said the ""creation of female imperial branches should be incorporated"" into the law and discussed as a ""realistic measure for maintaining the number of Imperial family members"". But that is unlikely to go down well with Japanese conservatives. ""This is all rooted in the concept of the unbroken male blood line - the notion that what makes Japan special is that it has an imperial line that has been passed down through a male lineage, if you believe the mythical version, ever since the Emperor Jimmu in 660 BC,"" says Professor Ken Ruoff, director of the Centre for Japanese Studies at Portland State University and an expert on the Japanese monarchy. ""This is what the nationalists seize upon and they actually will say things like if the male bloodline is broken, then Japan ceases to exist,"" he says. ""Female blood doesn't count."" Japan has had female rulers in the past, though not for about 250 years. In general they were seen as place-holders until the throne reverted to a male member of the family (though there was one case of an empress passing the throne to her daughter to act as regent for a male heir). Before the 1947 legal change, the royal family was much bigger, meaning that if one branch could not produce a male heir there were options elsewhere, but that is no longer the case. In the period before Prince Hisahito was born, when there was no younger-generation heir, there was considerable debate about changing the law to allow women on the throne. The prime minister of the day, Junichiro Koizumi, said he backed the move. But after Prince Hisahito's birth, discussions stalled. This video can not be played Watch: The beginning of a real-life fairytale? Japan's current leader, Shinzo Abe, is a more right-wing figure whose speaks often of national pride, tradition and patriotism. ""Prime Minister Abe has spent a lot of time talking about his desire to make Japan a society that shines for women but he's got this far-right faction that absolutely opposes changing the law to allow a woman to sit on the throne,"" says Prof Ruoff. One other idea is restoring royal status to branches that lost it in 1947, providing more male heirs. Mr Abe, the Yomiuri said, backed this in the past. ""It is hard to say the idea has won broad support,"" the paper pointed out. But there is public support for allowing women to inherit the throne. According to aKyodo News survey in early May,external, 86% supported allowing a woman emperor and 59% supported allowing an emperor from the female blood-line. This potentially leaves the government out of step with popular sentiment. Whatever happens, the future looks bright for Princess Mako. Of more concern, perhaps, is whether a 10-year-old boy has broad enough shoulders to carry the Japanese monarchy onwards.

"The claim:1.7 million pensioners are living in poverty and a million in fuel poverty. Reality Check verdict:The figure for pensioners who are defined as living in poverty in the UK is a bit higher than that at 1.9 million. There isn't a specific figure for the number of pensioners in fuel poverty in the UK but a million is not an unreasonable estimate based on the figures that we do have. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell spoke to BBC Radio 4's Today Programme on Friday about the Conservative manifesto pledge to means-test winter fuel payments. The Conservatives have not given any details of how they would apply a means test or how much they would hope to save. The winter fuel payment is between Â£100 and Â£300 (depending on your circumstances) paid to anyone receiving a state pension or people of pension age receiving certain other social security benefits. In winter 2015-16,externalit was paid to 12.2 million people, 42,000 of whom lived elsewhere in Europe. Kuenssberg: Labour cry foul over lack of Tory costings Pensioner heating curbs 'sick and sneaky' Mr McDonnell pointed out that since we don't know where the means test will fall, a number of less well-off pensioners could still lose the benefit. He suggested it might just be people entitled to pension credit who would get the fuel allowance, althoughgovernment sources have told the BBCthat would not be the mechanism, and that there would be a consultation process to decide how it would be tested. Pensioners with an income below Â£159.35 a week may claim pension credit - it's Â£243.45 for couples. According tothe latest figures from November,externalthere were 1.9 million people claiming pension credit, or 2.2 million if you include their partners, although there has beenresearch suggesting,externalthat about one-third of people entitled to it are not claiming. Mr McDonnell told the BBC that there were 1.7 million pensioners living in poverty and a million living in fuel poverty. People count as living in relative poverty if they are in households with an income below 60% of the median household income. The median income is the one for which half of households have higher incomes and half have lower. The government's preferred measure of pensioner poverty is after housing costs have been taken into account. Nearly three-quarters of pensioners live in homes that are owned outright (compared with roughly one in five of the working-age population) and so are less likely to have high housing costs. On that measure,external, 16% of UK pensioners are in poverty, which is 1.9 million people. There are also measures of absolute poverty, which may measure whether people are able to afford a basic lifestyle - about 8% of pensioners fall below the threshold for material deprivation. To measure fuel poverty, the government looks at two things - how much you have to pay for fuel, and what your income is. You'll be considered to be in fuel poverty if your required fuel costs are above average and, were you to spend that amount, your remaining income would leave you below the official poverty line as explained above. The latest government figures we have onfuel poverty relate to 2014,externaland suggest 2.38 million households in total in England were in fuel poverty. There isn't a specific figure for the number of UK pensioners in fuel poverty, but according toTable 14,externalthere were 621,000 households just in England in 2014 in which the oldest member was over 60. Age UK says this equates to more than 1 million individuals, although some of them will not yet be entitled to their state pension.

""There's a lot of interesting new neural imaging research showing that ECT actually reverses some of the brain problems in the major psychiatric illnesses,"" Kellner explains, as he makes final checks on the wiring around Jonah's temples. ""We don't know exactly why it works in people with autism and superimposed mood disorders, but we think it probably reregulates the circuits in the brain that are deregulated because of autism."" The modern treatment is carried out under general anaesthetic, with muscle relaxants to prevent violent convulsions. At the flick of a switch, Kellner administers just under an amp of electric current in a series of very short pulses. Jonah's body begins to shake as the current induces a seizure - ECT specialists think this may ""reset"" the malfunctioning brain. The convulsions last for about 30 seconds. Amy is unperturbed by what she sees. ""If a doctor says they need to cut open your child's chest to conduct life-saving surgery, you would allow it. That is more barbaric yet we accept it,"" she says. Within an hour Jonah is fully alert. He and his mother head out of the hospital and on to the New York street to find an ice cream parlour.

The UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence doesn't recommend ECT for use on under 18s. But ECT is a well-established treatment in adults for severe, often life-threatening depression. Its use is controversial, though, with memory loss the main acknowledged side-effect. What's disputed is the scale of the memory loss. Studies carried out by ECT doctors suggest lapses are mostly short-term and that memory function soon returns to normal. But opponents of ECT cite surveys claiming to show that more than half of patients suffer serious long-term memory loss. ""It's a traumatic brain injury,"" says Dr Peter Breggin, a psychiatrist who has long fought the psychiatric establishment, and campaigns for a total ban on ECT. ""The electricity not only travels through the frontal lobes - that's the seat of intelligence, and thoughtfulness and creativity and judgment - it also goes through the temporal lobes - the seat of memory. You are damaging the very expression of the personality, the character, the individuality, and even, if you believe in it, the expression of the soul."" For former US Army intelligence officer Chad Calvaresi and his wife Kaci, the potential benefits of ECT far outweigh the risks for their 11-year-old, violently autistic daughter, Sofija. ""When she was aggressing towards me, my instinct as a mom was to grab her and hold her and hug her and wait,"" Kaci explains. ""But she got so big and strong that I couldn't do that."" Sofija spent much of her early life suffering neglect and abuse in a Serbian orphanage, before Chad and Kaci adopted her in 2009. They were determined to give her a better life in America, but in 2016 they suffered the heartbreak of institutionalising her again - this time for her own safety. ""She beat herself so bad her nose was busted and bleeding, her lips were busted open and bleeding,"" Chad explains. ""She gave herself a black eye. I was scared of my own daughter."" For six months Sofija received medication and therapy as an in-patient at the renowned Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore, but there was little improvement. During her frequent violent episodes it often took three highly trained care staff - all wearing protective clothing and shielding Sofija with padded mats - to prevent her injuring herself or others. After exhausting all other options, Sofija's doctors finally agreed to Chad and Kaci's request to give her ECT. Just a month later her behaviour had improved enough for her to return home. We caught up with the family after six months and more than 30 treatments, and the transformation was remarkable. Sofija was swimming in the family pool and playing with her siblings, and while her violent episodes hadn't disappeared completely, her parents felt they were less intense and more manageable. Sofija was also receiving home schooling in maths and English. ""She's sharp as a tack,"" says Kaci. ""The only memory loss that Sofija has had from ECT is she forgets the procedure has actually happened."" ECT for severely self-injuring autistic children like Sofija is still in very limited use, and without a long-term scientific study it remains highly controversial. But even though Sofija is likely to need ECT every week for the foreseeable future, her parents have no regrets - they have their daughter back home. ""It's overwhelming if I think about it,"" says Kaci, ""but what future did she have without it? My hope is she doesn't need it for the rest of her life but at this point I see it like a diabetic needing insulin. It keeps her alive. Literally it keeps her alive and it makes it possible for us to be able to have her in our home living life with our family and enjoying Sofija."" Sofija enjoys a maths lesson at home For and against ECT The Royal College of Psychiatrists says ECT is a ""safe and effective treatment for severe depression"" in adults but acknowledgeson its website,externalthat some dispute this: For Many doctors and nurses will say that they have seen ECT relieve very severe depressive illnesses when other treatments have failed. Bearing in mind that 15% of people with severe depression will kill themselves, they feel that ECT has saved patients' lives, and therefore the overall benefits are greater than the risks. Some people who have had ECT will agree, and may even ask for it if they find themselves becoming depressed again. Against Some see ECT as a treatment that belongs to the past. They say that the side-effects are severe and that psychiatrists have, either accidentally or deliberately, ignored how severe they can be. They say that ECT permanently damages both the brain and the mind, and if it does work at all, does so in a way that is ultimately harmful for the patient. Some would want to see it banned.

"Ransomware cyber-attacks have risen 50% globally over the last 12 months The WannaCry cyber-attack infected more than 200,000 computers in 150 countries, affecting government, healthcare and private company systems. But how easily could it have been avoided and how can firms protect themselves against future attacks? On the face of it, the accepted narrative seems simple. Microsoft issued a patch, or update, for the vulnerability in its older Windows operating systems in March. If all IT departments everywhere had implemented this patch immediately, the WannaCry ransomware worm wouldn't have been able to run riot across the globe. Although the hackers are thought to have extorted just Â£60,000 worth of bitcoins, the disruption was significant, with some patients having operations and appointments cancelled and some corporate data being lost for ever. Cyber-attack: Your questions answered David Venable, vice-president of cyber-security at Masergy Communications, an IT services firm, is a former intelligence officer with the US National Security Agency. He says: ""There are a lot of practical challenges in deploying patch updates; from having unsupported operating systems [OSs] that don't have patches available, through to the practicalities of rolling out sweeping changes across massive networks, potentially globally. ""But these aren't new challenges - anyone running these networks should have had this solved long before now. ""This isn't rocket science; it's an oil change."" This video can not be played WannaCry fix is about leadership not money says Europol director And Rob Wainwright, director of Europol, believes that the recent failings in cyber defences were more to do with lack of leadership in large organisations than lack of IT investment. ""It's frustrating frankly, because in the health sector there have been multiple ransomware attacks, in the United States, in Europe, for the last two years, long before WannaCry came along, and so the lessons should have been heeded by now,"" he told the BBC. According to the Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report 2017, ransomware accounts for 72% of malware incidents in the healthcare industry. Overall, there has been a 50% rise in ransomware incidents reported in the last 12 months. But how easy is it really to keep large, complex computer networks up-to-date and protected? Nik Whitfield from security firm Panaseer says that for many large businesses, patching their systems isn't a question of turning on ""auto-updates"" then sitting back and relaxing. This is because some software applications specific to their business might rely on certain versions of operating systems (OS). Updating the OS could affect how those programs function. The WannaCry ransomware affected 150 countries around the world It's a point echoed by Adam Meyers, vice-president of cyber-security company CrowdStrike: ""It is important to recognise that patch roll-outs are complex. High-profile patch fiascos have made IT departments wary of automatic patch installations."" Some companies have suffered embarrassing shutdowns of their networks after patch roll-outs, for example. Health service providers in the UK and abroad were particularly affected because they were often reliant on old versions of Windows, and also because important medical equipment supplied by third parties - MRI scanners, blood analysis systems and so on - can't be easily upgraded or patched. ""Primarily this is because the patch may affect the equipment,"" says Simon Edwards, European cyber security architect at Trend Micro, ""but other times the vendor simply refuses to do it."" Older companies that have acquired or merged with other firms over the years, will have built up a ragtag patchwork of legacy systems - sometimes hundreds of programs - all requiring maintenance. ""It always comes down to prioritisation,"" says Mr Whitfield. ""There's always too much work to do, so they're constantly looking at how best to spend that next security dollar. A cancer hospital in Jakarta, Indonesia, was hit by the WannaCry malware ""Patching a business is like trying to mend a moving vehicle that is made from a hundred different vehicles bolted together."" This is why it can sometimes take months before known security vulnerabilities get patched. And the brutal truth is that there are plenty of companies and organisations that simply don't have enough IT staff or take cyber risk seriously enough, argues Mike DeCesare, chief executive of network security firm, ForeScout. As well as keeping antivirus, firewall, application and OS software up-to-date, backing up key data regularly to offline hard drives should be a top priority, most cyber experts agree. This is becausedata breaches and cyber-attacksare inevitable these days. The bad news is that the average cost of a data breach globally stands at $4m (Â£3.1m), according to SailPoint, an identity management firm. Cyber Adapt Boss Kirsten Bay says firms should protect critical data first One common problem is that companies often don't know what data they have, where it is, or what data is the most important, says Kirsten Bay, chief executive of network monitoring firm, Cyber Adapt. ""Concentrate on protecting the most critical data,"" she says. Cyber-security used to be about building an impregnable wall around your company. But now that hackers seem to be finding weak points in these perimeter defences with increasing ease - largely due to the proliferation of wireless devices accessing the network at home and in the office - focus has moved towards defending critical parts within the network. ""Once inside an organisation a hacker or malware will get around pretty quickly,"" explains David Venable, ""but if you take the 'zero trust model' approach and treat every network as hostile, a lot of this could have been prevented."" In practice, this means constantly monitoring your network for unusual behaviour and only giving access to certain data and applications to those who absolutely need it. French vehicle maker Renault also fell victim to the global attack Everyone else is treated as potentially hostile, even if they work for you. ""By identifying a suspicious process or behaviour and applying machine learning to let all other computers know about it, organisations can be on the front foot,"" argues CrowdStrike's Mr Meyers. Trend Micro's Simon Edwards warns companies against thinking there's a simple one-size-fits-all solution to these cyber-security challenges. ""Companies should never rely on one technology or process to stop malware,"" he says. ""They need to use multiple methods which inter-operate with one another to detect and stop attacks."" There is evidence that firms have been rushing out to buy security products in the aftermath of the WannaCry attack. Erich Litch, chief revenue officer for software marketplace 2Checkout says: ""In the US, the number of security software purchases is up 43% as organisations look to avoid the large-scale attacks seen in the UK."" About 40 hospitals in the UK's National Health Service were affected by the attack In the UK, sales have risen 25%, he says. ""[But] panic buying security software is not the answer. Make cyber-security an active part of your strategy, not a reaction to a disaster."" This takes board-level commitment to cyber-security, most experts agree. The worry for businesses everywhere is that the cyber threat is only going to increase as the world becomes more connected and the internet of things (IoT) accelerates. ""In many cases IoT devices are either impossible to patch or at best very challenging to patch,"" warns Paul Lipman, chief executive of BullGuard. ""We're seeing billions of new devices entering businesses and homes, with little-to-no security built in, and challenging to update. ""This is a hacker's dream and a recipe for a cyber-security disaster."" At least the WannaCry attack has woken everyone up to the fact that the cyber-threat is real, growing and impossible to ignore any longer.

"This video can not be played Kane one of world's best - Pochettino Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino says Harry Kane is ""one of the best strikers in the world"", and insists the club can keep their best players this summer. Kane, 23, scored four in Thursday's 6-1 win at Leicester to move to the top the golden boot standings, ahead of Romelu Lukaku and Alexis Sanchez. Pochettino said: ""Harry Kane's a special player, he loves Tottenham. ""The players we want to keep will be here next season. If any players leave, it's Tottenham's decision."" This video can not be played Leicester made it too easy for Kane - Shakespeare Match report: Leicester City 1-6 Tottenham Hotspur Listen: 5 live football daily podcast - Kane & Spurs demolish Leicester Kane, the Premier League's top scorer last season with 25, moved to 26 for this campaign with two late goals in the victory at the King Power Stadium. Kane, midfielder Dele Alli and defender Kyle Walker continue to be linked with transfers, but Pochettino says the club are in control of the England internationals' futures. ""I think we are so, so, so calm about our big players and they are so happy here,"" said the Argentine. ""We are building a very exciting project. The players must feel they are part of us and want to share in our success. ""Harry Kane means a lot for the team. I tell you always that he's one of the best strikers in the world. His performances show that we are right."" Kane has scored two goals more than Everton's Romelu Lukaku and three more than Alexis Sanchez of Arsenal Kane has missed eight league games with injury this season but looks set to finish as top scorer, unless Everton striker Lukaku or Arsenal forward Sanchez have a remarkable final day of the season. The latter two players will be on opposing sides at Emirates Stadium on Sunday, while Kane and Spurs go to Hull. All 10 Premier League matches on Sunday kick off at 15:00 BST. Kane averages a goal every 94 minutes in the league this season, and unsurprisingly described the campaign as his best yet. ""It probably could have been more,"" he said. ""It is the first time in my professional career that I've scored four, there has been a bit of build-up in the race for the golden boot and I wanted at least one or two to put the pressure on - but to get four is amazing. ""This is my best season. I missed 11 weeks and worked hard during my injury to ensure I came back in better shape than I started."" Kane's top-flight goals this term have earned Spurs 13 points, which is second only behind Chelsea striker Diego Costa's 20 goals, earning the Blues 15 points. Only six players have scored more Premier League trebles than Kane. Ex-Newcastle and Blackburn striker Alan Shearer heads the list with 11.

He has 51 goals in two seasons and that is great numbers. Those who work with him and know him will say he deserves it. He works incredibly hard at his game. He is determined. He has taken a few knocks along the way but he is showing everything he has got right now. He is a combination of [former England strike partners] Teddy Sheringham and Alan Shearer. The Manchester City striker finds the net every 111 minutes. (Measured on players who have scored a minimum of 50 Premier League goals). Kane is the fifth player in Premier League history to score 25 or more goals in successive seasons - Robbie Fowler, Thierry Henry, Alan Shearer and Robin van Persie are the others. Kane has now scored 10 goals against Leicester, more than against any other side. Kane is the fifth player to score three or more hat-tricks in a Premier League season. In Kane, Alli and Son Heung-min, Tottenham now have three players with 20 or more goals in all competitions this season - more than any other club in the Premier League or the EFL.

"Jimmy Anderson goes off injured in the Roses match at Old Trafford In-form Gary Ballance out for 74 for Yorkshire against Lancashire Surrey's Kumar Sangakkara hits century against Middlesex at Lord's Alastair Cook and Tom Westley make hundreds for Essex against Hants Division Two leaders Notts in good position against Glamorgan Paul Grunill There was a fair bit of rain about on the opening day of the latest round of County Championship matches, but that did not prevent some quality cricket being played. Alastair Cook and Tom Westley hit centuries in a 243-run stand for Essex against Hampshire, the impeccable Kumar Sangakkara helped himself to an unbeaten 113 for Division One leaders Surrey against Middlesex, and Jake Libby and Riki Wessels both passed three figures for Notts in Cardiff. One of the main talking points, though, occurred early in the Roses match at Old Trafford when England paceman Jimmy Anderson had to go off with a groin problem. Despite that, Yorkshire had to fight hard to reach 251-6 at the close, and an intriguing battle is in prospect over the remaining three days. We'll be back with you again tomorrow from 10.30ish to bring you events as they happen on day two. Until then, have a good evening. Division One Essex 243-2 v Hampshire Yorkshire 251-6 v Lancashire Surrey 265-5 v Middlesex Warwickshire 93-3 v Somerset Division Two Derbyshire 111-3 v Worcestershire Nottinghamshire 335-6 v Glamorgan Leicestershire v Kent - no play possible because of rain Essex 243-2 (79 overs) v Hampshire It's a dramatic finish at Chelmsford as Kyle Abbott bowls Tom Westley with the final ball of the opening day's play. Westley made 111 - with the help of 16 fours - and shared a stand of 243 with Alastair Cook, a second-wicket partnership record for Essex in matches against Hampshire. After a delayed start and the loss of Nick Browne in the opening over, the day belonged to the two home batsmen, with Cook finishing unbeaten on 114 as he continues his build-up towards the Test seies against South Africa, which starts in early July. Essex must be grateful to have so much of his time this season and if Cook stays in for long on day two, then they will certainly have a maximum haul of batting points in their sights. Derbyshire director of cricket Kim Barnett has revealed that they will be without South African fast
bowler Hardus Viljoen until the end of June with a hip injury. ""Itâs
typical of cricket that things come to test you,"" said Barnett. ""This is a test of our guys
and the resilience of the squad. Viljeon was expected to make his Derbyshire Championship debut, after featuring in five of their One-Day Cup group games. But Barnett revealed: ""We had a meeting yesterday when it was decided he wasnât
fully fit and I think he knew that. ""We just want him to do himself justice. Itâs no use him going out at 70 per cent fit and not bowling to his standards
so we must get him fully fit and healthy to do what he can do when he comes
back.â Derbyshire 111-3 (40 overs) v Worcestershire After the loss of the first two sessions because of a wet outfield following overnight rain, the sporadic crowd at Derby finally saw some action in an extended two-and-a-half-hour final session. Worcestershire claimed three wickets - one in the first over for captain Joe Leach, then also for Jack Shantry and Josh Tongue. But Derbyshire opener Luis Reece had the best of it, remaining unbeaten at the close as the winter signing from Lancashire notched his second half-century for the hosts. When he got his first, in Derbyshire's opening game of the season against Northants in April, he went on to reach three figures, posting a career-best 168. Reece (53*) will be hoping for more of the same tomorrow, when he and captain Billy Godleman (13*) are due to resume, weather permitting, at 11:00 BST. Yorkshire 251-6 (96 overs) v Lancashire Jack Leaning (54*) and Andy Hodd (41*) survive to stumps in what has been a very important 73-run seventh-wicket partnership for Yorkshire at Old Trafford. Losing both openers with only nine runs on the board was a terrible start for the White Rose county, but well though Lancashire bowled, the early loss of Jimmy Anderson with an injury left skipper Steven Croft an important option short. Early wickets on day two would put the home side in the driving seat, but it would be a brave person to make predictions following Lancashire's last Championship game, when they were all out for 109 and still won. Surrey 265-5 (72 overs) v Middlesex The bad light at Lord's was followed by a rain shower, and although the umpires took a long, hard look at conditions, they have decided that play is over for the day. Kumar Sangakkara has been the star of the show so far and will resume on 113 not out - a 151-ball innings featuring two sixes and 11 fours - as the Division One leaders look to push on towards 300 and beyond against the reigning champions. Nottinghamshire 335-6 (96 overs) v Glamorgan Nottinghamshire end the day on top and looking to complete maximum battling bonus points on Saturday morning - but it did not seem that way after the first two sessions in Cardiff. .At 155-4 at tea, Glamorgan's bowlers had done well to keep the Division Two leaders pegged back, particularly Timm van der Gugten, who ended with 4-52. But Jake Libby went on to extend their fifth-wicket stand to 123, both completing centuries in the process. Libby went first for 109 before Wessels followed for 120, while former captain Chris Read weighed in with some late hitting for an unbeaten 45 as 180 came in the final session. Notts 330-6 (94.1 overs) v Glamorgan Riki Wessels' 21st first-class century comes to an end - a fourth wicket for Timm van der Gugten - and a second bowling bonus point for Glamorgan. Derbyshire 79-3 (29.4 overs) v Worcestershire A third wicket for Worcestershire - and a first for Josh Tongue has Derbyshire's Wayne Madsen caught behind. 10 more overs to come at Derby after this one. Essex 221-1 (67.5 overs) v Hampshire Now that he's given up the England Test captaincy, Alastair Cook's opinion of young leg-spinner Mason Crane may not carry the weight it once did. Cook reaches his second first-class hundred of the summer, and 58th in all, with a boundary off the youngster. For those who dislike the term 'run-machine', it is one, nevertheless, that can justifiably be applied to Cook - his last seven innings in all competitions have been 127, 37, 109, 67*, 65, 54 and now this century. Essex 213-1 (66.5 overs) v Hampshire After being tied down in a maiden over from leg-spinner Mason Crane, Tom Westley square drives a boundary in the next off Sean Ervine to beat partner Alastair Cook to a century. It's taken him 178 balls and is his first of the season - and 16th of his career. Not counting any chickens, but Cook shouldn't be far behind. Yorkshire 242-6 (90 overs) v Lancashire There are six overs remaining at Old Trafford after Jack Leaning pulls a short ball from Tom Bailey for six to bring up a 146-ball half-century. It's been a fine innings for his side and they should collect a second batting point before stumps. Essex 201-1 (63 overs) v Hampshire It's a neck and neck race at Chelmsford as Alastair Cook and Tom Westley close in on centuries against Hampshire. Cook has 93 not out, one fewer than his partner, and together they are only 20 short of the second-wicket record stand of 221 for Essex against Hampshire, set by Denys Wilcox and Stan Nichols at Southend in 1936. Yorkshire 228-6 (88 overs) v Lancashire Lancashire have taken the new ball, but with Jimmy Anderson hors de combat, it's Ryan McLaren who shares it with Tom Bailey, and neither has been able to make it count - yet. Jack Leaning is 46 not out for Yorkshire and although that's nowhere near his highest score, this may be one of his most valuable innings for the county in terms of his development as a batsman. Partner Andy Hodd is batting with greater fluency, on 33 from 46 balls. They have added 51 in 14 overs. Notts 290-5 (87 overs) v Glamorgan Wessels hits his second ton in as many matches as he becomes Nottinghamshire's second centurion of the day, following Jake Libby who earlier made 109. The pair put on 123 for the fifth wicket to help the visitors gain control of this game. And he is now getting further support from 38-year-old Chris Read as Notts, having been 155-4 at tea, now make hay. Wessels' latest effort comes on top of his unbeaten 202 in the Division Two leaders' last match - their innings victory over Sussex. Derbyshire 58-2 (21.4 overs) v Worcestershire Another breakthrough for Worcestershire at Derby as Jack Shantry has Shiv Thakor caught by Daryl Mitchell running back at second slip. But opener Luis Reece still seems to be going nicely. Surrey 265-5 (72 overs) v Middlesex That is a disappointment, with the match intriguingly poised at the home of cricket. There are 24 more overs scheduled, so let's hope this interruption is brief, like the one earlier on for rain. Looking at that sky, though (see below), perhaps not. Kumar Sangakkara is 113 not out and Sam Curran has yet to score. The weather is the winner in the end at Grace Road as umpires Russell Evans and Jeff Evans finally call a halt to their attempts to get the Leicestershire-Kent game started. They're playing just 32 miles away to the north at Derby. But that's cricket in England, in the middle of May, for you! Surrey 264-5 (70.3 overs) v Middlesex Division One leaders Surrey have banked two bonus points but Steven Finn makes another important breakthrough for Middlesex, with the new ball only 10 overs away as Ben Foakes edges to the keeper. Sam Curran is the new batsman, but it's Kumar Sangakkara - now 112 not out - who is the key if the visitors are to push on towards a full set of batting points at Lord's. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Protesters in Medellin hold inflatables to represent social leaders killed so far in 2017 In 2016, Colombia's homicide rate dropped to its lowest in four decades, at some 12,000 cases. And yet the number of social leaders and human rights defenders killed has been on the rise. By early May, the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights confirmed 14 murders of human rights defenders since the beginning of 2017. They said they had another 10 cases pending verification. Francisco GÃ³mez, a social leader in Arauca province, in the east of the country, only narrowly escaped becoming part of these statistics. He had to spend a month in an intensive care unit after two men entered his house in the early hours in February, sneaking into the room where he was sleeping, and stabbing him in the stomach, chest and legs. A member of a local human rights organisation, Mr Gomez survived thanks to the quick help offered by Juan Torres, a member of the left-wing Marcha PatriÃ³tica party with whom he shared the house. ""Hadn't I been at home he would have bled to death,"" Mr Torres told the BBC. As it was, Mr GÃ³mez had a heart attack just before entering the operating room, but luckily it did not prove fatal. And if he is to be considered one of the lucky ones, it paints a serious picture. At a protest in May, men put up a map of Colombia marked with the places where social leaders have been killed since the peace deal was signed Exact figures for the number of deaths are hard to come by. Non-governmental organisation Somos Defensores (We Are Defenders) says 80 social leaders and human rights activists were killed last year. The UN has a figure of 64, while the state ombudsman puts it even higher, at more than 100. Part of the discrepancy comes from differences in defining human rights leaders. Yet they all agree on one thing: the numbers have increased since 2015. Todd Howland, a representative of the UN's Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in Colombia, told the BBC that this could be linked to the after-effects of the country's peace agreement between the government and Farc guerrillas. Although it was signed at the end of 2016, the wheels were already in motion in the previous year, with the militants gradually leaving the areas they had historically controlled, and thus creating a power vacuum. Colombian rebels rejoin civilian life Colombia faces violence despite peace deal - ICRC ""You can explain almost the whole increase, and more, based on what is happening with the Farc's demobilisation,"" said Mr Howland. Some of the people murdered are thought to have had specific links to the Farc; others may have posed a threat to illegal groups, usually criminal gangs trying to establish themselves in the areas. ""I do not think there's a group of people who sit down to say, 'Let's kill these people because we do not like peace',"" said Paula Gaviria, a human rights adviser to the Colombian presidency. Paula Gaviria says there are people eager to suggests there were no benefits from the peace deal ""But obviously,"" she said, ""killing social leaders is generating a sense in communities and public opinion that there is no positive impact of peace."" Ms Gaviria admitted that perpetrators still did not feel killing a social leader was high risk. For that to change, she said, investigations and convictions were crucial. Mr Howland added: ""The Colombian state has a responsibility to protect the rights of all their citizens, and the specific responsibility of protecting human rights defenders."" William Castillo Chima was killed on 7 March 2016 William Castillo Chima, a 43-year-old member of Marcha PatriÃ³tica and leader of a local human rights organisation in the gold mining area El Bagre, in the central Antioquia province, is one of the unlucky ones. In March last year, he was having an early-evening soft drink in a local bar, when some men entered and shot him dead. He was a very active social leader, according to his friend Camilo Villamil, who worked with the same workers' rights group. ""He was always reporting on armed groups, paramilitary groups, state forces and corruption,"" he told the BBC. Mr Villamil said his friend was killed by a criminal gang and that other leaders - including himself - remained at risk. Everyone the BBC spoke to agrees that the homicides of social leaders and human rights defenders will continue in Colombia. The UN's Todd Howland said they would only stop ""when there's economic, social and political inclusion in the areas [where the murders take place]"".

"US President Donald Trump is embarking on his first overseas trip since taking office, visiting Saudi Arabia, Israel and the Vatican - the homes of Islam, Judaism and Christianity. Saudi Arabia is, on the face of it, a surprising choice of destination for Mr Trump's first overseas trip since taking office. The birthplace of Islam, and home to the holy pilgrimage sites of Mecca and Medina, is hosting a man recently accused of Islamophobia for his failed attempts to ban visitors from six Muslim-majority countries. In February 2016, during his presidential election campaign, he suggested that Saudi officials had been complicit in the 9/11 attacks. ""Who blew up the World Trade Center?"" he said. ""It wasn't the Iraqis, it was Saudi - take a look at Saudi Arabia, open the documents."" So what has changed since then? A lot, is the answer. As president, Mr Trump has decided that one way of distancing himself from the foreign policies of his predecessor Barack Obama is to vilify Iran and cosy up to the Saudis. Soon after taking office in January he sent his new CIA Director, Mike Pompeo, to Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, where he received red-carpet welcomes. Saudi officials are rolling out the red carpet for Donald Trump Then came the key turning point in forging a new relationship between Washington and Riyadh - March's visit to the White House by the young Saudi Deputy Crown Prince and Defence Minister, Prince Mohammed Bin Salman. The two men hit it off together immediately. They are both currently taking their respective countries down new and risky paths - Mr Trump with his recent missile strike on Syria and his facing down the North Koreans, and the prince with his leadership of the Saudi-led war against Yemen's Houthi rebel movement. Their primary area of shared interest was their common view that Shia power Iran represented a threat to the Middle East. This video can not be played Trump's first trip: What's on the agenda in Saudi Arabia? For the Saudis, Iran's Sunni regional rivals, this was music to their ears. They lost confidence in Mr Obama, some years ago, suspecting him of ""going soft"" on Iran in the rush to secure a nuclear deal before the end of his presidency. Prince Mohammed emerged from that White House meeting pronouncing that he was ""very optimistic"" about President Trump, who he said would ""bring America back to the right track"". So what exactly are the main issues under discussion when the vast US presidential machine rolls into Riyadh? Countering the terrorist threat, specifically from so-called Islamic State (IS, or ""Daesh"" as Arabs call this transnational jihadist organisation), will loom large in discussions. The US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), along with other Western intelligence agencies and special forces, has been helping the Saudi authorities cope with terrorism since the al-Qaeda insurgency of 2003 and before that even as far back as the 1979 siege of Mecca. The US military helps trains Saudi special forces personnel IS, a Sunni extremist group that considers Shia apostates, has bombed Shia mosques in both Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. But it has also attacked Sunni mosques where security personnel worship, and it continues to plot attacks inside Saudi Arabia on both Westerners and Saudi officials. In the 2000s, the Saudi authorities defeated the al-Qaeda insurgency through a combination of police and military action, and a public awareness campaign that turned Saudi society against the jihadists. But today, with conflicts raging in Iraq, Syria, Libya and Yemen, the problem has returned with sizeable numbers of young Saudis feeling drawn to the extreme ""takfiri"" ideology of IS. IS suicide bombers have targeted Shia mosques in Saudi Arabia Thousands have gone to Syria to fight for either IS or other jihadist groups, and many analysts accuse Saudi Arabia of being part of the problem, not doing enough to clamp down on public statements by clerics who are hostile and intolerant of other religions while exporting a narrow-minded ideology abroad. As a presidential candidate, Mr Trump promised he had a secret plan to defeat IS. In reality, US military strategy in the Syria-Iraq arena has not fundamentally altered course during his first four months in office, although some Obama-era checks and balances on certain operations have been lifted. In Riyadh, there will be broad agreement about the threat posed by the jihadists of IS, but this is unlikely to translate into any new large-scale deployment of either country's forces to Syria or Iraq. This video can not be played Saudi FM: Trump visit is coup for peace Saudi Arabia's rulers see Iran and the militias it supports as the greatest threat to the region - an allegation that is denied, not surprisingly, by Tehran. Their Sunni-ruled neighbours, Bahrain and the UAE, also see Iran as a major threat. So too do certain key members of President Trump's administration, most notably National Security Adviser Gen H R McMaster and Defence Secretary James Mattis. The Iranian-backed Lebanese Shia group Hezbollah is fighting Saudi-supported rebels in Syria Both men served in the military and remember the frequent clashes between the US Navy and the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps in the Gulf. They also recall the bombing of the US Marine barracks in Beirut in 1983 that killed more than 200 US personnel and was blamed on Hezbollah. Mr Trump has also been vociferous in his criticism of Iran and the 2015 nuclear deal, calling it ""the worst deal ever"", something which has played into the hands of Iran's hardliners, who also oppose the deal. Saudi Arabia, a Sunni-majority nation, has been locked in an on-off regional power struggle with Shia-majority Iran ever since the Islamic Revolution there in 1979. The execution of Shia cleric Nimr al-Nimr by the Saudi authorities caused outrage in Iran Notable flashpoints have been stampedes at the annual Hajj pilgrimage, in which hundreds of Iranian pilgrims have been killed, and the 2016 execution by the Saudis of a Shia cleric, which sparked the ransacking of the Saudi embassy in Tehran and the breaking off of diplomatic relations. Prince Mohammad declared this month that there was no point in even talking to the Iranian regime at present. Current Gulf Arab distrust of Iran stems from several areas: Tehran's support for the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad; the expansion of Hezbollah's operations outside Lebanon; the arming and training of Shia militias in Iraq; the powerful influence Tehran now exerts over the Iraqi government in Baghdad; Iranian support for Yemen's Houthi rebels; and its alleged covert encouragement of Shia insurgents in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia's restive Eastern Province. Iran, for its part, retorts that Saudi Arabia is the root of the terrorist problem with its acquiescence towards religious intolerance and its global proselytising based on the narrow ideology of Salafism. Prince Mohammed Bin Salman accused Iran of trying ""to control the Islamic world"" The Iranians point, with some justification, at the common ideology shared by IS and hardline Saudi clerics, as well as the practice of beheading prisoners. (Iran also executes a large number of prisoners annually but usually by hanging or firing squad). Iran has pointed out that the Saudis and Qataris have spent vast sums over the last six years in funding Sunni militias in Syria in a vain attempt to defeat Mr Assad's forces. In practical terms, the joint US-Saudi position on Iran is likely to translate into increased sales of sophisticated US weaponry; a near absence of criticism of Saudi Arabia's human rights record; and a reversal of Mr Obama's suspension of a contract to supply Riyadh with precision-guided munitions for air strikes that was halted last year because of mounting civilian casualties in Yemen. When President Trump's plane lifts off from Riyadh at the end of the Saudi leg of this trip, he will be hoping to have in his pocket some promises of major Saudi investment in the US - up to $40bn (Â£31bn), according to some reports. Find out which foreign leaders President Trump has met or called since taking office, as well as the countries he has mentioned in his tweets. What has Trump said about your country? His key interlocutor here will once again be Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, who in addition to being defence minister is overseeing Saudi Arabia's economic development. The prince, or ""MBS"" as he is often called, has huge plans to transform not just Saudi Arabia's oil-dependent economy, including the partial privatisation of the state oil giant Saudi Aramco, but also its cultural landscape. State oil giant Saudi Aramco plans to list about 5% of its shares At the risk of angering his country's conservative clerics and their supporters, the prince wants to introduce public entertainment, making Saudi Arabia ""a happier place"". This will go down well with much of the country's bored and underemployed youth, and there are ample opportunities here for the US entertainment industry. But there are also dangers. King Faisal, who ruled from 1964 to 1975, angered religious conservatives by introducing television and education for women. He was assassinated.

"Electroconvulsive therapy - in which a small electric current is passed through the brain causing a seizure - is now used much less often than it was in the middle of the last century. But controversially it is now being used in the US and some other countries as a treatment for children who exhibit severe, self-injuring behaviour. Seventeen-year-old Jonah Lutz is severely autistic. He's also prone to outbursts of violent behaviour, in which he sometimes hits himself repeatedly. His mother, Amy, is convinced that if it wasn't for electroconvulsive therapy - ECT - he would now have to be permanently institutionalised for his own safety, and the safety of those around him. The use of ECT featured famously in the 1975 Hollywood movie, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, starring Jack Nicholson. Set in a mental institution, the Oscar-winning film cemented most people's view of ECT as barbaric. But Amy describes the modern version of the therapy as little short of miraculous. ""ECT has been transformative for Jonah's life and for our life,"" she says. ""We went for a period of time - for years and years - where Jonah was raging, often multiple times a day, ferociously. The only reason he's able to be at home with us, is because of ECT."" It's estimated that one in 10 severely autistic children like Jonah violently attack themselves, often causing serious injuries ranging from broken noses to detached retinas. No-one really knows why. Some theories link self-injuring behaviour to anxiety caused by an overload of sensory signals, others to frustration as the autistic child struggles to communicate. Amy and husband Andy tried countless traditional treatments using medication or behavioural therapy before finally turning to ECT - a treatment that first began to be used on children like Jonah a decade ago, in parts of the US. Each session alleviates his symptoms for up to 10 days at a time - but it's not a cure. Jonah's doctor, Charles Kellner, ECT director at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, is so convinced it's effective and safe that he allows Amy to witness the procedure and the BBC to film it. Prof Kellner says the best way to overcome the negative image of ECT portrayed in popular culture is ""to show people what modern ECT is really like, and show them the results with patients like Jonah"". Jonah is one of a few hundred children in the US to receive the controversial treatment. He has had about 260 ECT sessions since the age of 11. ""There's a lot of interesting new neural imaging research showing that ECT actually reverses some of the brain problems in the major psychiatric illnesses,"" Kellner explains, as he makes final checks on the wiring around Jonah's temples. ""We don't know exactly why it works in people with autism and superimposed mood disorders, but we think it probably reregulates the circuits in the brain that are deregulated because of autism."" The modern treatment is carried out under general anaesthetic, with muscle relaxants to prevent violent convulsions. At the flick of a switch, Kellner administers just under an amp of electric current in a series of very short pulses. Jonah's body begins to shake as the current induces a seizure - ECT specialists think this may ""reset"" the malfunctioning brain. The convulsions last for about 30 seconds. Amy is unperturbed by what she sees. ""If a doctor says they need to cut open your child's chest to conduct life-saving surgery, you would allow it. That is more barbaric yet we accept it,"" she says. Within an hour Jonah is fully alert. He and his mother head out of the hospital and on to the New York street to find an ice cream parlour.

The UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence doesn't recommend ECT for use on under 18s. But ECT is a well-established treatment in adults for severe, often life-threatening depression. Its use is controversial, though, with memory loss the main acknowledged side-effect. What's disputed is the scale of the memory loss. Studies carried out by ECT doctors suggest lapses are mostly short-term and that memory function soon returns to normal. But opponents of ECT cite surveys claiming to show that more than half of patients suffer serious long-term memory loss. ""It's a traumatic brain injury,"" says Dr Peter Breggin, a psychiatrist who has long fought the psychiatric establishment, and campaigns for a total ban on ECT. ""The electricity not only travels through the frontal lobes - that's the seat of intelligence, and thoughtfulness and creativity and judgment - it also goes through the temporal lobes - the seat of memory. You are damaging the very expression of the personality, the character, the individuality, and even, if you believe in it, the expression of the soul."" For former US Army intelligence officer Chad Calvaresi and his wife Kaci, the potential benefits of ECT far outweigh the risks for their 11-year-old, violently autistic daughter, Sofija. ""When she was aggressing towards me, my instinct as a mom was to grab her and hold her and hug her and wait,"" Kaci explains. ""But she got so big and strong that I couldn't do that."" Sofija spent much of her early life suffering neglect and abuse in a Serbian orphanage, before Chad and Kaci adopted her in 2009. They were determined to give her a better life in America, but in 2016 they suffered the heartbreak of institutionalising her again - this time for her own safety. ""She beat herself so bad her nose was busted and bleeding, her lips were busted open and bleeding,"" Chad explains. ""She gave herself a black eye. I was scared of my own daughter."" For six months Sofija received medication and therapy as an in-patient at the renowned Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore, but there was little improvement. During her frequent violent episodes it often took three highly trained care staff - all wearing protective clothing and shielding Sofija with padded mats - to prevent her injuring herself or others. After exhausting all other options, Sofija's doctors finally agreed to Chad and Kaci's request to give her ECT. Just a month later her behaviour had improved enough for her to return home. We caught up with the family after six months and more than 30 treatments, and the transformation was remarkable. Sofija was swimming in the family pool and playing with her siblings, and while her violent episodes hadn't disappeared completely, her parents felt they were less intense and more manageable. Sofija was also receiving home schooling in maths and English. ""She's sharp as a tack,"" says Kaci. ""The only memory loss that Sofija has had from ECT is she forgets the procedure has actually happened."" ECT for severely self-injuring autistic children like Sofija is still in very limited use, and without a long-term scientific study it remains highly controversial. But even though Sofija is likely to need ECT every week for the foreseeable future, her parents have no regrets - they have their daughter back home. ""It's overwhelming if I think about it,"" says Kaci, ""but what future did she have without it? My hope is she doesn't need it for the rest of her life but at this point I see it like a diabetic needing insulin. It keeps her alive. Literally it keeps her alive and it makes it possible for us to be able to have her in our home living life with our family and enjoying Sofija."" Sofija enjoys a maths lesson at home For and against ECT The Royal College of Psychiatrists says ECT is a ""safe and effective treatment for severe depression"" in adults but acknowledgeson its website,externalthat some dispute this: For Many doctors and nurses will say that they have seen ECT relieve very severe depressive illnesses when other treatments have failed. Bearing in mind that 15% of people with severe depression will kill themselves, they feel that ECT has saved patients' lives, and therefore the overall benefits are greater than the risks. Some people who have had ECT will agree, and may even ask for it if they find themselves becoming depressed again. Against Some see ECT as a treatment that belongs to the past. They say that the side-effects are severe and that psychiatrists have, either accidentally or deliberately, ignored how severe they can be. They say that ECT permanently damages both the brain and the mind, and if it does work at all, does so in a way that is ultimately harmful for the patient. Some would want to see it banned.
