"This video can not be played The National Crime Agency said no attempt had been made to disguise the haul Four men have been convicted of smuggling half a tonne of cocaine with a street value of more than Â£41m into the UK on a private jet. Fifteen suitcases of the drug were found at Farnborough Airport in January on a plane returning from Colombia. Allessandro Iembo, Martin Neil and Victor Franco-Lorenzo were jailed for 24 years each while Jose Ramon Miguelez-Botas was jailed for 20 years. Border Force officers said the haul was one of the largest they had dealt with. Italian national Iembo, 28, Neil, 49, and Spanish national Franco-Lorenzo, 40, all from Bournemouth, and Miguelez-Botas, 56, from Spain, were found guilty of fraudulent evasion of a prohibition in relation to a class A controlled drug, between 30 October last year and 30 January. Neil's brother, Stephen, who was also on trial, was found not guilty of the charge. The court heard the four convicted men - along with Stephen Neil, who had been described by lawyers as ""naive"" - travelled together to Bogota, Colombia, in a jet from Luton Airport on 26 January at a cost of Â£138,500. They arrived at Farnborough Airport three days later with 15 suitcases of cocaine on board. Allessandro Iembo, Martin Neil, Jose Ramon Miguelez-Botas and Franco Lorenzo were all found guilty They were met by a fleet of cars hired to carry their baggage but were stopped by Border Force officers. The National Crime Agency (NCA) said no attempt had been made to disguise the haul, which weighed 500kg and were labelled with a ""Superman"" logo, thought to be linked to a major Colombian cartel. In the investigation that followed, it emerged three of the men - Iembo, Franco-Lorenzo and Martin Neil - had made a previous undetected trip in December 2017. A woman had called a private jet broker saying she represented a group of rich men who worked in the music industry and were involved in cryptocurrencies. She said they were travelling to Colombia to see singer Bruno Mars perform and wanted to hire a plane from Luton Airport and would pay Â£128,500 in cash. The private jet arrived at Farnborough Airport in January with cocaine on board X-ray pictures of their baggage, retrieved later, appeared to show millions of pounds in banknotes used to pay for the drugs. Iembo told jurors he had made trips as a personal assistant for a charity and had assumed the suitcases, which were loaded on to the plane before the trip, contained charity documents. When the plane returned, suitcases were taken to an address in Bromley. Investigators found the gang had a corrupt official working for a ground handling company at Bogota Airport who ensured the drugs were loaded on to the plane. A parallel investigation in Colombia led to five arrests. Police discovered criminals in Bogota had used armoured vehicles and a bogus police officer with a fake sniffer dog to ""inspect"" the luggage before it was taken on to the plane. Martin Neil celebrated as his older bother was cleared on Thursday. Judge Philip Shorrock said the ""serious and commercial operation"" nearly succeeded in bringing an ""enormous haul"" of cocaine into the UK. Border Force officers found 500kg of the drug in 15 suitcases He said, while the four did not mastermind the operation, they played a ""crucial part"" in the hope of walking away with a ""substantial"" amount of money. NCA senior manager Steve McIntyre called the January seizure ""an audacious smuggling attempt"" which highlighted ""a border vulnerability"". He said: ""There are over 3,000 airports or airstrips in the UK and there's no way on this earth that any law enforcement agency is going to be able to man those all the time. ""By working collaboratively, we are making headway now. It's about intelligent policing and profiling better."" Mr McIntyre said, despite being bricklayers, the Neil brothers and their co-defendants ""lived an interesting lifestyle of lavish motor vehicles to get them to the aircraft"". He said: ""They were using the charity as a cover story, saying they were dealing in cryptocurrency and they were involved in the music industry and that was part of their VIP story."" X-ray pictures retrieved from a previous trip appeared to show suitcases full of bank notes In 2016, the Independent Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration raised concerns that customs checks at smaller airports were not rigorous enough, including at Farnborough. Monique Wrench, deputy director of Border Force Heathrow, which also looks after Farnborough, said: ""We've taken that report incredibly seriously and upped our effort."" The Farnborough seizure, she said, demonstrated Border Force officers could pick out passengers and bags which looked suspicious for further checks. She added the haul had been ""an amazing morale boost"". ""This is one of the largest seizures in our region's history and it's a day we want to celebrate,"" she said.

"British Airways and Air France have announced that they will stop flying to Iran next month. Both airlines said that the route was ""not commercially viable."" The reintroduction of US sanctions has caused a slump in the value of the Iranian currency, the rial, making it harder for Iranians to travel overseas. BA restarted the service to Tehran two years ago after a four-year gap. The last flight will be on 22 September, returning the next day. The airline apologised to travellers planning to travel to Iran and said it was offering refunds for affected customers or a possible rerouting through other airlines. Air France, which had transferred its connections with Tehran to its low-cost airline Joon, had reduced the frequency of the flights from three to one a week since the beginning of this month. It will stop all flights on 18 September. KLM said last month that it would also suspend flights from Amsterdam to Iran from September. The sanctions, prompted partly by Washington's decision in May to abandon the Iran nuclear deal, have prompted many western firms to step back from business in Iran. Companies such as the French energy giant Total, German insurer Allianz and Danish tanker operator Maersk have said they are preparing to wind down their operations in Iran.

"The tunnel is suspected to have been used to shuffle drugs from Mexico into the US US authorities have found a secret drug tunnel stretching from a former KFC in the state of Arizona to Mexico. The 600ft (180m) passageway was in the basement of the old restaurant in San Luis, leading under the border to a home in San Luis Rio Colorado. Authorities made the discovery last week and have arrested the southern Arizona building's owner. They were alerted to the tunnel after the suspect, Ivan Lopez, was pulled over, according toKYMA News,external. Watch: Inside US-Mexico border 'drug tunnel' Watch: Drug tunnel stretches 800m under Mexico-US border Huge drugs catapult found on US border During the traffic stop, police dogs reportedly led officers to two containers of hard narcotics with a street value of more than $1m in Lopez's vehicle. Investigators say the containers held more than 118kg (260lb) of methamphetamine, 6kg of cocaine, 3kg of fentanyl, and 19kg of heroin. Agents searched Lopez's home and his old KFC, discovering the tunnel's entrance in the kitchen of the former fast-food joint. The tunnel led from an old KFC restaurant to a home in Mexico A video showing the tunnel walls The passageway was 22ft deep, 5ft tall and 3ft wide, and ended at a trap door under a bed in a home in Mexico, said US officials. The drugs are believed to have been pulled up through the tunnel with a rope. This is not the first such discovery - two years ago a 2,600ft tunnel was found by authorities in San Diego, California. Authorities said it was one of the longest such drug tunnels ever discovered, used to transport an ""unprecedented cache"" of cocaine and marijuana. In July alone, US Border Patrol seized 15kg of heroin, 24lbs of cocaine, 327kg of methamphetamine and 1,900kg of marijuana at border checkpoints nationwide.

"Jeff Sessions has been a frequent target of Mr Trump's very public ire US Attorney General Jeff Sessions has responded to Donald Trump's latest attack on him by insisting that the justice department he heads will not bend to political pressure. The apparent rebuke of Mr Trump came after the president said Mr Sessions was not in control of his department. Mr Trump has been vociferous in his criticism of the Department of Justice. He has been particularly riled by its handling of the inquiry into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Mr Sessions, an early supporter of Mr Trump's campaign, has stepped aside from that inquiry to avoid a potential conflict of interest and handed control to his deputy, Rod Rosenstein. That decision by Mr Sessions, and the ongoing progress of the inquiry under special counsel Robert Mueller - which is also reportedly now looking into whether Mr Trump has attempted to obstruct justice - have provoked frequent outbursts from the president, both in person and on his Twitter feed. The president remains insistent that there was no collusion between his campaign and the Russian government, and denies he has attempted to obstruct justice. Impeach me and the market crashes - Trump After the latest exchanges, two key Republican senators signalled that they would support Mr Trump if he were to fire Mr Sessions after the November mid-term elections. However, otherRepublicans told Politico they thought this would be a bad move,externaland said they were standing by the attorney general. ""I took control of the Department of Justice the day I was sworn in,"" the attorney general said in a statement. ""While I am attorney general, the actions of the Department of Justice will not be improperly influenced by political considerations. ""I demand the highest standards, and where they are not met, I take action."" He added: ""No nation has a more talented, more dedicated group of law enforcement investigators and prosecutors than the United States. ""I am proud to serve with them and proud of the work we have done in successfully advancing the rule of law."" Previously, Mr Sessions had been largely non-committal following criticism of him by the president, who appears to believe that Mr Sessions should have shown him greater loyalty instead of recusing himself from the Russia inquiry. In an earlier interview with the Fox and Friends programme, Mr Trump said:  ""I put in an attorney general that never took control of the justice department. Jeff Sessions never took control of the justice department and it's a sort of an incredible thing."" Turning to the Russia inquiry, the president said: ""Jeff Sessions recused himself, which he shouldn't have done. Or he should have told me [before I appointed him]. ""Even my enemies say that Jeff Sessions should have told you that he was going to recuse himself, and then you wouldn't have put him in. He took the job and then he said I'm going to recuse myself.  I said: 'What kind of a man is this?' ""You know the only reason I gave him the job? Because I felt loyalty, he was an original supporter. He was on the campaign.  He knows there was no collusion."" By Tara McKelvey, White House reporter Jeff Sessions was originally brought into the Trump campaign because of his hardline views on immigration. A stubborn man, Mr Sessions fought for decades for anti-immigration policies. Still, he has a gentle manner. I've seen him greeting colleagues with a shy smile at White House events. Mr Trump prides himself on never giving up, and he admires grit and determination in others - and found those traits in Mr Sessions. But now he is driving President Trump crazy. Mr Sessions is just as determined as Mr Trump is - and also refuses to back down. Only Mr Sessions is guided by a set of bedrock conservative principles, rather than the egotism and quicksilver impulses that fuel Mr Trump's tweets and, increasingly, his TV interviews. For these reasons Mr Sessions is a formidable enemy, and the battle between these two men could be long. Mr Sessions made his statement during a fraught week for the White House. This video can not be played A law professor outlines President Trump's perilous legal situation Two days ago, in the most dramatic developments yet linked to the Russia inquiry, former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort was found guilty of tax and bank fraud and Mr Trump's former personal lawyer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to crimes including tax evasion, bank fraud and campaign finance violations. Trumpland's crazy Tuesday, blow by blow Under oath, Cohen said he had been directed by Mr Trump to organise secret payments to silence two women who claimed they had affairs with the then Republican presidential candidate, violating campaign finance laws. Mr Trump has denied he broke the law. The sense that the president's legal troubles are growing were not dampened by Thursday's US media reports that prosecutors in the Cohen case had granted immunity from prosecution to the chairman of the company that publishes the National Enquirer, David Pecker, a friend of Mr Trump. In the lead-up to the 2016 presidential election, Playboy model Karen McDougal sold her story of her alleged affair with Mr Trump to the Enquirer. The contract she signed gave the tabloid exclusive story rights and banned her from talking publicly about the alleged affair. The story was never published. Despite the sense of crisis, it is generally believed that the Department of Justice is very unlikely to bring charges against a sitting president. And correspondents say it is unlikely Mr Trump's opponents would try to impeach him before the mid-term elections. How easy is it to impeach a president? Impeachment can of worms Trump's chances of weathering the storm Who's who in the drama to end all dramas Mr Trump's most fervent supporters, what he refers to as his ""base"" outside the political cauldron of Washington DC, seem unfazed by the latest developments. During the Fox News interview that was aired on Thursday, the president: Responded to speculation that he might be impeached by warning that any such move would damage the economy Insisted that payments to two women alleging they had affairs with him had not broken election campaign rules Attacked the ""flipping"" process - whereby prosecutors promise a suspect a short sentence in exchange for co-operation - as ""not fair"" and something that ""almost ought to be outlawed"" Claimed that Cohen avoided up to 20 years in jail because ""if you can say something bad about Donald Trump... you'll go down to two years or three years, which is the deal he made"" Said he would award himself an ""A-plus"" grade for his work as president so far.

"Mr Cooper is understood to have died from a heart attack Thomas Cook is removing all its customers from a hotel in Egypt after the death of a British couple. John Cooper, 69, and his wife Susan, 63, from Burnley, died while staying at the Steigenberger Aqua Magic in the Red Sea resort of Hurghada. Egyptian authorities said Mr Cooper was taken ill with heart problems, but the couple's daughter said the cause of their deaths was unclear. Kelly Ormerod said her parents had been ""fit and healthy"". Mrs Ormerod, who was also at the hotel with her three children, said in a statement toLancashire-based radio station 2BR,external: ""They had no health problems at all. ""We have no cause of death, a post-mortem is under way. ""Dad never went to hospital, he died in the hotel room in front of me. I went to hospital in the ambulance with Mum, where she passed away."" Mrs Ormerod praised the support from Thomas Cook, which said it had received ""further reports of a raised level of illness among guests"". Up to 1,600 guests are staying at the hotel, according to owner Deutsche Hospitality In a statement, Thomas Cook said 301 holidaymakers will have options for alternative hotels from Friday onwards and those wishing to go home will be flown back on Friday. It added: ""Safety is always our first priority, so as a precautionary measure we have taken a decision to remove all our customers from this hotel. ""While we understand this is upsetting for those on holiday, we believe this is the right thing to do."" Sven Hirschler, senior director of corporate communications for the hotel's parent company Deutsche Hospitality, said there was not an unusual level of illness among the 1,600 guests staying at the hotel. He added Mr Cooper had complained of low blood pressure and was treated by the hotel's on-site doctor on the night he died. Other guests have told the BBC about their experiences with illness during stays at the Steigenberger Aqua Magic. Janine Traviss, from Oldham, and her partner fell ill with a stomach bug during a holiday which ended earlier this month. ""I subsequently have been ill for several weeks now since returning and had to visit the doctors on two occasions with two full weeks of antibiotics. ""I am still recovering and still feel very tired and exhausted most days."" Thomas Cook said it is working closely with the hotel and is supporting the local authorities with their investigations. It stated the hotel was last audited late last month and received an overall score of 96%. ""We will be contacting those customers due to travel to the Steigenberger Aqua Magic Hotel in Hurghada in the next four weeks to offer alternative holiday options,"" the tour operator added. Susan Cooper worked at the Thomas Cook branch in Burnley, which was closed on Thursday Mrs Cooper worked at the travel firm's Burnley branch, which was closed on Thursday.

"The Free Nazanin campaign group released pictures of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe reunited with her daughter Gabriella A British-Iranian woman has been reunited with her family after being granted a three-day release from prison in Iran. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe wasjailed for five years in 2016after being convicted of spying, which she denies. She said she was ""overwhelmed"" and it would be ""awesome"" for her four-year-old daughter to ""have a mummy again"". Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said her imprisonment was a ""gross injustice"" and the release should be permanent. The Free Nazanin campaign group said a three-day release was ""standard practice"" ahead of lengthier times out of jail and her lawyer was due to apply for an extension on Saturday. This video can not be played Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's husband Richard spoke to his wife as she left the Iranian prison. Her husband Richard Ratcliffe said her temporary release was a ""happy surprise"" and she is with family in Damavand. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who works for the charity Thomson Reuters Foundation, was arrested at Tehran airport after visiting her family on holiday. Iranian authorities have accused her of espionage but she insists the visit was to introduce her daughter to her family. What is Iran jail case about? Prisoner caught in Iran power struggle Iran's jailed dual nationals and their uncertain fate In a statement issued by the Free Nazanin campaign, Mr Ratcliffe said his wife was still in her nightclothes when she was given 10 minutes notice on Thursday morning that she was being released until Sunday 26 August. The campaign group said the possibility of release had been discussed for several weeks but there had been ""a number of false dawns"". She was released on condition she does not: Conduct interviews with the media Visit a foreign embassy, especially the UK's Attempt to leave Iran Free Nazanin said Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe and her father have both separately promised she will obey the rules. By BBC World Affairs correspondent Richard Galpin It was around two weeks ago that Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe first heard she might be allowed to leave Evin prison for a few days so she could see her family and in particular her four year-old daughter Gabriella. After several false alarms she is now reunited with them. So far there's been no official announcement by the Iranian authorities explaining why they decided to grant her this respite now. One theory is that it's a gesture during the Islamic festival of Eid. Another possibility is that the appointment of a new foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt changed the diplomatic dynamics. Although earlier this week, Mr Hunt admitted he had not yet decided whether to grant Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe diplomatic protection as a means of improving her chances of being released, much to the frustration of her family. Gabriella picked flowers to give her mother upon her release In comments issued by the campaign, Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe said she ""wasn't expecting it at all"". She said: ""It will be just awesome for Gabriella to have mummy home finally. We can play with her dolls house and she can show me her toys. ""The thought of brushing her hair, and giving her a bath; of being able to take her to the park, and feed her, and sleep next to her - it just kills me. It is still so hard to believe. ""I was so emotional to see my grandmother today. I cried so much. I felt so overwhelmed. ""It felt like this really could be the beginning of the end."" Mr Ratcliffe has campaigned for her release since she was jailed andmet Foreign Secretary Jeremy Huntearlier this month, who vowed to do ""everything we can to bring her home"". The campaign thanked ""all those involved in making this possible in Tehran and London, and the new foreign secretary"". Mr Ratcliffe said: ""Furlough is not full freedom - we want her home, not just on holiday from prison - but after 873 days it is a massive step."" Mr Hunt called the release ""really good news"" with credit going to the ""tireless campaigning"" of Mr Ratcliffe and the family's friends. He also thanked the Iranian authorities ""whilst not forgetting that she should not be in prison in the first place"". ""Nazanin is innocent,"" the foreign secretary added. Richard Ratcliffe said he will not stop campaigning until his wife is home According to Free Nazanin, Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was told she had 10 minutes to get ready to leave, with her cellmates gathering around to see her off. Once dressed, she was taken to the door and, following a detailed search of each item she was taking out of prison, she was taken from the ward to the main entrance of Evin prison in Tehran. Unknown to her, her family had been called by the prison authorities an hour earlier but they were out of Tehran on holiday in Damavand about 46 miles (74km) away to celebrate Eid. Her father was on his way back to Tehran when she was released. Prison authorities asked her not to stand outside the prison so she crossed a nearby bridge where she asked a family waiting for another inmate to be released if she could borrow their phone to call her brother, who was still in Tehran. He arrived within 10 minutes and she called her husband and then the British embassy before her father arrived. The trio then travelled to the family celebration where they arrived just in time for lunch. A spokesman for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said: ""We remain very concerned about all our dual nationals detained in Iran, and continue to make decisions in line with what we believe will produce the best outcomes in their cases. ""We do not think it is in the best interests of any of our dual national detainees to provide a running commentary on individual cases."" The Iranian ambassador in London said Iran's Foreign Ministry is in contact with the country's judiciary to help Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe on ""humanitarian grounds"". Hamid Baeidinejad made the comment in response to a Twitter user who asked if he would intervene to release her permanently from prison. Mr Baeidinejad posted a photo of the mother and her four-year-old daughter reunited describing it as a ""lovely picture"". Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's family havepreviously criticised the UK governmentfor not negotiating her release. Boris Johnsonprovoked consternation in Novemberlast year when he told MPs that Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been ""training journalists"" in Iran.

"This video can not be played Corbyn suggests group of Zionists need lessons in history and irony A Jewish Labour MP has said she feels ""unwelcome"" in the party after a video emerged showing Jeremy Corbyn accusing British Zionists of having ""no sense of English irony"". Liverpool Wavertree MP Luciana Berger described the Labour leader's comments, in a 2013 speech, as ""inexcusable"". The clip was published on theDaily Mail website,externalas Mr Corbyn makes efforts to tackle anti-Semitism in his party. An ally of Mr Corbyn said his remarks had been ""taken out of context"". Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the focus should not be on what Mr Corbyn said five years ago, before he became party leader, but on tackling anti-Semitism in British society, including within Labour. Zionism refers to the movement to create a Jewish state in the Middle East, roughly corresponding to the historical land of Israel, and thus support for the modern state of Israel. A guide to Labour anti-Semitism claims What's the difference between anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism? In the speech - made at an event at the Palestinian Return Centre - Mr Corbyn recalled a disagreement between some Zionists and the Palestinian representative to the UK, Manuel Hassassian, following a speech Mr Hassassian had made in Parliament. He said: ""This [Hassassian's speech] was dutifully recorded by the thankfully silent Zionists who were in the audience on that occasion, and then came up and berated him afterwards for what he'd said."" Mr Corbyn, who was a backbench MP at the time, went on to claim that the people concerned ""clearly have two problems"". ""One is they don't want to study history, and secondly, having lived in this country for a very long time, probably all their lives, they don't understand English irony either."" He added: ""They needed two lessons, which we could perhaps help them with."" Writing onTwitter,external, Ms Berger, said: ""The video released today of the leader of @UKLabour making inexcusable comments - defended by a party spokesman - makes me as a proud British Jew feel unwelcome in my own party. ""I've lived in Britain all my life and I don't need any lessons in history/irony."" Other Labour MPs expressed solidarity with Ms Berger. Allow Twitter content?

But shadow chancellor John McDonnell said Mr Corbyn's comments had been taken ""out of context"" in a way that was ""not helpful"" and likely to exacerbate tensions in the party. Asked whether he would have used such language, he told BBC Radio 4's Today ""in certain contexts, certain phrases are appropriate"". Mr Corbyn, he said, had devoted his political life to pursuing peace and reconciliation in the Middle East while Labour was committed to playing a ""full role"" in tackling anti-Semitism within its own ranks and in society. ""Let's recognise there is anti-Semitism in our society and let's have a real serious debate about the actions needed to tackle that anti-Semitism, wherever it is displayed,"" he said. A Labour spokesman said Mr Corbyn had been ""referring to a group of pro-Israel activists misunderstanding - and then criticising - the Palestinian ambassador for a speech at a separate event about the occupation of the West Bank"". Corbyn apologises over 2010 event Corbyn wreath row explained Labour 'not connected' to abusive posts But the Conservatives have urged the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards to investigate whether Mr Corbyn had brought the Commons into disrepute and breached the code of conduct for MPs. Earlier this month,Mr Corbyn apologisedover an event he hosted in 2010 where a Holocaust survivor compared Israel to Nazism. After the Times published details of the event, the Labour leader said he had ""on occasion appeared on platforms with people whose views I completely reject"" and was sorry for the ""concerns and anxiety that this has caused"". He also been criticised for his presence at a ceremony in Tunisia in 2014, which is said to have honoured the perpetrators of the 1972 Munich terror attack, during which 11 members of the Israeli Olympic team were taken hostage and killed. Mr Corbyn said he had attended to take part in a ceremony honouring innocent victims of a 1985 Israeli air strike.

"The Free Nazanin campaign group released pictures of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe reunited with her daughter Gabriella A British-Iranian woman has been reunited with her family after being granted a three-day release from prison in Iran. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe wasjailed for five years in 2016after being convicted of spying, which she denies. She said she was ""overwhelmed"" and it would be ""awesome"" for her four-year-old daughter to ""have a mummy again"". Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said her imprisonment was a ""gross injustice"" and the release should be permanent. The Free Nazanin campaign group said a three-day release was ""standard practice"" ahead of lengthier times out of jail and her lawyer was due to apply for an extension on Saturday. This video can not be played Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's husband Richard spoke to his wife as she left the Iranian prison. Her husband Richard Ratcliffe said her temporary release was a ""happy surprise"" and she is with family in Damavand. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who works for the charity Thomson Reuters Foundation, was arrested at Tehran airport after visiting her family on holiday. Iranian authorities have accused her of espionage but she insists the visit was to introduce her daughter to her family. What is Iran jail case about? Prisoner caught in Iran power struggle Iran's jailed dual nationals and their uncertain fate In a statement issued by the Free Nazanin campaign, Mr Ratcliffe said his wife was still in her nightclothes when she was given 10 minutes notice on Thursday morning that she was being released until Sunday 26 August. The campaign group said the possibility of release had been discussed for several weeks but there had been ""a number of false dawns"". She was released on condition she does not: Conduct interviews with the media Visit a foreign embassy, especially the UK's Attempt to leave Iran Free Nazanin said Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe and her father have both separately promised she will obey the rules. By BBC World Affairs correspondent Richard Galpin It was around two weeks ago that Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe first heard she might be allowed to leave Evin prison for a few days so she could see her family and in particular her four year-old daughter Gabriella. After several false alarms she is now reunited with them. So far there's been no official announcement by the Iranian authorities explaining why they decided to grant her this respite now. One theory is that it's a gesture during the Islamic festival of Eid. Another possibility is that the appointment of a new foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt changed the diplomatic dynamics. Although earlier this week, Mr Hunt admitted he had not yet decided whether to grant Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe diplomatic protection as a means of improving her chances of being released, much to the frustration of her family. Gabriella picked flowers to give her mother upon her release In comments issued by the campaign, Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe said she ""wasn't expecting it at all"". She said: ""It will be just awesome for Gabriella to have mummy home finally. We can play with her dolls house and she can show me her toys. ""The thought of brushing her hair, and giving her a bath; of being able to take her to the park, and feed her, and sleep next to her - it just kills me. It is still so hard to believe. ""I was so emotional to see my grandmother today. I cried so much. I felt so overwhelmed. ""It felt like this really could be the beginning of the end."" Mr Ratcliffe has campaigned for her release since she was jailed andmet Foreign Secretary Jeremy Huntearlier this month, who vowed to do ""everything we can to bring her home"". The campaign thanked ""all those involved in making this possible in Tehran and London, and the new foreign secretary"". Mr Ratcliffe said: ""Furlough is not full freedom - we want her home, not just on holiday from prison - but after 873 days it is a massive step."" Mr Hunt called the release ""really good news"" with credit going to the ""tireless campaigning"" of Mr Ratcliffe and the family's friends. He also thanked the Iranian authorities ""whilst not forgetting that she should not be in prison in the first place"". ""Nazanin is innocent,"" the foreign secretary added. Richard Ratcliffe said he will not stop campaigning until his wife is home According to Free Nazanin, Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was told she had 10 minutes to get ready to leave, with her cellmates gathering around to see her off. Once dressed, she was taken to the door and, following a detailed search of each item she was taking out of prison, she was taken from the ward to the main entrance of Evin prison in Tehran. Unknown to her, her family had been called by the prison authorities an hour earlier but they were out of Tehran on holiday in Damavand about 46 miles (74km) away to celebrate Eid. Her father was on his way back to Tehran when she was released. Prison authorities asked her not to stand outside the prison so she crossed a nearby bridge where she asked a family waiting for another inmate to be released if she could borrow their phone to call her brother, who was still in Tehran. He arrived within 10 minutes and she called her husband and then the British embassy before her father arrived. The trio then travelled to the family celebration where they arrived just in time for lunch. A spokesman for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said: ""We remain very concerned about all our dual nationals detained in Iran, and continue to make decisions in line with what we believe will produce the best outcomes in their cases. ""We do not think it is in the best interests of any of our dual national detainees to provide a running commentary on individual cases."" The Iranian ambassador in London said Iran's Foreign Ministry is in contact with the country's judiciary to help Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe on ""humanitarian grounds"". Hamid Baeidinejad made the comment in response to a Twitter user who asked if he would intervene to release her permanently from prison. Mr Baeidinejad posted a photo of the mother and her four-year-old daughter reunited describing it as a ""lovely picture"". Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's family havepreviously criticised the UK governmentfor not negotiating her release. Boris Johnsonprovoked consternation in Novemberlast year when he told MPs that Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been ""training journalists"" in Iran. The then-foreign secretary later stated in the Commons that he had ""no doubt"" she was on holiday and had called Tehran to clarify after the Iranian authorities moved to double her sentence.

"Faith Fennidy, aged 11, sobs as she is told to leave class because of her braided hair style A video of a schoolgirl leaving class because her braids violated school rules has generated a discussion on discrimination and the lack of understanding about black people's hair. Eleven-year-old Faith Fennidy is shown in footageposted on Facebook,externalwiping away tears as she packs up her belongings at the Christ the King Parish School in Terrytown, Louisiana. Faith's mother Montrelle is heard asking a teacher to explain why her daughter's braids, that are tied in a ponytail, contravene school policy. ""What's wrong with her hair? Her hair is fine,"" she says. The private school says students cannot have extensions or hairpieces, that are often used to create long braided hairstyles. In a statement to the BBC, the Archdiocese of New Orleans said the school's policy allowed only ""natural hair"". ""This policy was communicated to all parents during the summer and again before the first day of school, and was applied to all students. ""The school offered the student's family an opportunity to comply with the uniform and dress policy and the family chose to withdraw the student; the student was not suspended or expelled."" The Fennidy family say they have sought legal advice following what happened and are looking for another school for Faith to attend. Allow Facebook content?

"Mr Salmond was first minister of Scotland between 2007 and 2014 The former Scottish first minister, Alex Salmond, has described sexual misconduct allegations against him as ""patently ridiculous"". The claims date back to December 2013, when Mr Salmond was still in office, according to theDaily Record.,external In a statement, he said he was taking the Scottish government to court to challenge the complaints procedure which had been activated against him. The Scottish government said it would ""defend its position vigorously"". And it said it was vital that any allegations of harassment were treated seriously and investigated thoroughly, regardless of who was said to have been involved. Alex Salmond profile The Daily Record said Mr Salmond was reported to police over allegations he sexually assaulted two staff members at the first minister's official residence at Bute House in Edinburgh in December 2013. A Police Scotland spokesman said the force was ""not going to comment on whether an inquiry is ongoing."" Mr Salmond, who had two spells as leader of the pro-independence SNP, led the devolved Scottish government as first minister from 2007. He quit in the aftermath of the independence referendum in 2014, when Scotland voted to remain in the United Kingdom. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In his statement, Mr Salmond says he refutes all of the allegations against him. He did not say what the claims were, but described some of them as being ""patently ridiculous"". He also said that ""on the advice of Senior Counsel"" he had been complaining to the Scottish government's permanent secretary, Leslie Evans, that the complaints procedure was ""unjust"" and ""unlawful"". The permanent secretary isresponsible for the Scottish government's 5,000 civil servants,external, and is the principal policy advisor to Nicola Sturgeon, who succeeded Mr Salmond as first minister and SNP leader. Mr Salmond said: ""Even now I have not been allowed to see and therefore to properly challenge the case against me. ""I have not been allowed to see the evidence. I have tried everything, including offers of conciliation, mediation and legal arbitration to resolve these matters both properly and amicably. ""This would have been in everybody's interests, particularly those of the two complainants. All of these efforts have been rejected."" Mr Salmond has hosted a show on the controversial RT station since last November Leader of Scottish National Party 1990-2000 and 2004-2014 First Minister of Scotland 2007 - 2014 Stood down after Scotland voted to remain in the United Kingdom Mr Salmond said that ""with great reluctance"" he had launched a judicial review against the Scottish government at the Court of Session. He said that if he lost the case he would have to answer to the complaints against him ""both comprehensively and publicly"". But he warned that ""the administration at the senior levels of the Scottish government will have the most serious questions to answer"" if the court finds in his favour. This will send shockwaves through the country, not just the political bubble that Alex Salmond has operated in for many decades. The story broke just after 10 o'clock last night, when Mr Salmond released a statement on his social media sites in response to a story in the Daily Record newspaper. The headline from the statement is extraordinary enough - he is going to take the Scottish government to court, which given that he used to head that government is a remarkable development. But it's even more extraordinary when you consider the reasons why. Mr Salmond has decided to challenge the Scottish government's complaints procedure after two people, according to Mr Salmond, lodged complaints against him. He also says that he intends to give media interviews, perhaps as early as today. Responding to his statement, a Scottish government spokesman said: ""We can confirm that Alex Salmond has initiated legal proceedings against the Scottish government and as a result we are restricted in what we can say. ""However, the Scottish government will defend its position vigorously. As a matter of principle and integrity, it is vital that any allegations of harassment are treated seriously and investigated thoroughly, regardless of the identity of the party involved."" Mr Salmond was elected as the SNP MP for Gordon in 2015 before losing the seat in the snap general election two years later. He has faced heavy criticism for hosting the Alex Salmond Show on Russian broadcaster RT, which has been described as a propaganda channel for the Kremlin - a claim Mr Salmond has denied.

"Faith Fennidy, aged 11, sobs as she is told to leave class because of her braided hair style A video of a schoolgirl leaving class because her braids violated school rules has generated a discussion on discrimination and the lack of understanding about black people's hair. Eleven-year-old Faith Fennidy is shown in footageposted on Facebook,externalwiping away tears as she packs up her belongings at the Christ the King Parish School in Terrytown, Louisiana. Faith's mother Montrelle is heard asking a teacher to explain why her daughter's braids, that are tied in a ponytail, contravene school policy. ""What's wrong with her hair? Her hair is fine,"" she says. The private school says students cannot have extensions or hairpieces, that are often used to create long braided hairstyles. In a statement to the BBC, the Archdiocese of New Orleans said the school's policy allowed only ""natural hair"". ""This policy was communicated to all parents during the summer and again before the first day of school, and was applied to all students. ""The school offered the student's family an opportunity to comply with the uniform and dress policy and the family chose to withdraw the student; the student was not suspended or expelled."" The Fennidy family say they have sought legal advice following what happened and are looking for another school for Faith to attend. Allow Facebook content?

"Rosemary Powell began collecting for the Poppy Appeal when it started in 1921 A former World War Two nurse who is believed to be Britain's longest-serving poppy seller has died at the age of 103, her family have said. Rosemary Powell, who began collecting for the appeal when it was started in 1921, passed away on 15 August, nine days after she was handed her MBE. London-born Mrs Powell wasincluded on the Honours List for her service to the Royal British Legion. In an obituary, her family said: ""She had known the cost of war."" The Legion said it was ""forever in debt to Rosemary for her efforts."" She is survived by three sons, four grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. During World War Two, Rosemary Powell trained as a Voluntary Aid Detachment (VAD) nurse In her obituary, her family described Mrs Powell's experiences and memories having lived through two World Wars. ""She could recall the London bombing raid on 28 November 1916, and her first meeting with her father when she was four, when he finally returned from active service,"" they wrote. During World War Two she worked as a voluntary aid detachment (VAD) nurse, treating members of the military. Her patients included soldiers wounded on the beaches in Normandy and her family said she was ""probably the second person to save someone's life with an injection of the new, dark yellow, syrup-like penicillin."" The great-grandmother received her MBE medal during a ceremony at her nursing home Mrs Powell previously spoke about how war ""has had a significant impact on my life"". Her father Charles Ashton James was left wounded after being shot in the head during the Battle of the Somme, and she lost two godfathers and three uncles during World War One. The great-grandmother's first fiance Robin Ellis, who was a commander in the Royal Navy, died in 1944 and her younger brother Peter also died during World War Two. She lived close to where poppies were made in 1921 and sold them on Richmond Bridge Mrs Powell firsthelped sell poppies with her mother on Richmond Bridgewhen she was six. She announced her retirement from the appeal earlier in the year with her final collection being held at the nursing home where she was presented with her MBE. Nevertheless, the great-grandmother's support for the Royal British Legion will continue after her death, with a donation from each copy of her memoir going to the charity. A spokesperson for the Legion said her ""dedication"" to the appeal ""was nothing short of remarkable"". ""The presentation of her MBE was a fitting tribute to a woman whose volunteering and fundraising efforts will be spoken about for generations to come,"" they said. Mrs Powell's funeral will be held later this month with a special memorial event at St Paul's Church, Knightsbridge - where she was married in 1952 - to follow in October.

"Smyllum Park in Lanark operated as a children's home from 1864 until 1981 Twelve people, some of them nuns, have been arrested over claims of abuse at a former children's home in Lanarkshire. Police said 11 women and one man - all aged between 62 and 85 - had been charged in connection with the abuse of children at Smyllum Park. The home, which closed in 1981, was run by a Catholic order known as Daughters of Charity of St Vincent de Paul. Police said a further four people were due to be reported to the Crown Office in connection with their investigation. Scottish abuse inquiry to be extended Smyllum Park took in more than 11,600 children over the course of its existence from 1864 to 1981. It has been hit by claims of sexual and physical abuse and is being investigated as part of theScottish Child Abuse Inquiry,external(SCAI).

""I'm in my 50s now and I still feel scared."" The Scottish Child Abuse Inquiry, which is investigating allegations of abuse against children in care across Scotland, has heard from former residents at the home, who described suffering beatings, abuse and mistreatment.

"Mr Cooper is understood to have died from a heart attack Thomas Cook is removing all its customers from a hotel in Egypt after the death of a British couple. John Cooper, 69, and his wife Susan, 63, from Burnley, died while staying at the Steigenberger Aqua Magic in the Red Sea resort of Hurghada. Egyptian authorities said Mr Cooper was taken ill with heart problems, but the couple's daughter said the cause of their deaths was unclear. Kelly Ormerod said her parents had been ""fit and healthy"". Mrs Ormerod, who was also at the hotel with her three children, said in a statement toLancashire-based radio station 2BR,external: ""They had no health problems at all. ""We have no cause of death, a post-mortem is under way. ""Dad never went to hospital, he died in the hotel room in front of me. I went to hospital in the ambulance with Mum, where she passed away."" Mrs Ormerod praised the support from Thomas Cook, which said it had received ""further reports of a raised level of illness among guests"". Up to 1,600 guests are staying at the hotel, according to owner Deutsche Hospitality In a statement, Thomas Cook said 301 holidaymakers will have options for alternative hotels from Friday onwards and those wishing to go home will be flown back on Friday. It added: ""Safety is always our first priority, so as a precautionary measure we have taken a decision to remove all our customers from this hotel. ""While we understand this is upsetting for those on holiday, we believe this is the right thing to do."" Sven Hirschler, senior director of corporate communications for the hotel's parent company Deutsche Hospitality, said there was not an unusual level of illness among the 1,600 guests staying at the hotel. He added Mr Cooper had complained of low blood pressure and was treated by the hotel's on-site doctor on the night he died. Other guests have told the BBC about their experiences with illness during stays at the Steigenberger Aqua Magic. Janine Traviss, from Oldham, and her partner fell ill with a stomach bug during a holiday which ended earlier this month. ""I subsequently have been ill for several weeks now since returning and had to visit the doctors on two occasions with two full weeks of antibiotics. ""I am still recovering and still feel very tired and exhausted most days."" Thomas Cook said it is working closely with the hotel and is supporting the local authorities with their investigations. It stated the hotel was last audited late last month and received an overall score of 96%. ""We will be contacting those customers due to travel to the Steigenberger Aqua Magic Hotel in Hurghada in the next four weeks to offer alternative holiday options,"" the tour operator added. Susan Cooper worked at the Thomas Cook branch in Burnley, which was closed on Thursday Mrs Cooper worked at the travel firm's Burnley branch, which was closed on Thursday.

"This video can not be played The National Crime Agency said no attempt had been made to disguise the haul Four men have been convicted of smuggling half a tonne of cocaine with a street value of more than Â£41m into the UK on a private jet. Fifteen suitcases of the drug were found at Farnborough Airport in January on a plane returning from Colombia. Allessandro Iembo, Martin Neil and Victor Franco-Lorenzo were jailed for 24 years each while Jose Ramon Miguelez-Botas was jailed for 20 years. Border Force officers said the haul was one of the largest they had dealt with. Italian national Iembo, 28, Neil, 49, and Spanish national Franco-Lorenzo, 40, all from Bournemouth, and Miguelez-Botas, 56, from Spain, were found guilty of fraudulent evasion of a prohibition in relation to a class A controlled drug, between 30 October last year and 30 January. Neil's brother, Stephen, who was also on trial, was found not guilty of the charge. The court heard the four convicted men - along with Stephen Neil, who had been described by lawyers as ""naive"" - travelled together to Bogota, Colombia, in a jet from Luton Airport on 26 January at a cost of Â£138,500. They arrived at Farnborough Airport three days later with 15 suitcases of cocaine on board. Allessandro Iembo, Martin Neil, Jose Ramon Miguelez-Botas and Franco Lorenzo were all found guilty They were met by a fleet of cars hired to carry their baggage but were stopped by Border Force officers. The National Crime Agency (NCA) said no attempt had been made to disguise the haul, which weighed 500kg and were labelled with a ""Superman"" logo, thought to be linked to a major Colombian cartel. In the investigation that followed, it emerged three of the men - Iembo, Franco-Lorenzo and Martin Neil - had made a previous undetected trip in December 2017. A woman had called a private jet broker saying she represented a group of rich men who worked in the music industry and were involved in cryptocurrencies. She said they were travelling to Colombia to see singer Bruno Mars perform and wanted to hire a plane from Luton Airport and would pay Â£128,500 in cash. The private jet arrived at Farnborough Airport in January with cocaine on board X-ray pictures of their baggage, retrieved later, appeared to show millions of pounds in banknotes used to pay for the drugs. Iembo told jurors he had made trips as a personal assistant for a charity and had assumed the suitcases, which were loaded on to the plane before the trip, contained charity documents. When the plane returned, suitcases were taken to an address in Bromley. Investigators found the gang had a corrupt official working for a ground handling company at Bogota Airport who ensured the drugs were loaded on to the plane. A parallel investigation in Colombia led to five arrests. Police discovered criminals in Bogota had used armoured vehicles and a bogus police officer with a fake sniffer dog to ""inspect"" the luggage before it was taken on to the plane. Martin Neil celebrated as his older bother was cleared on Thursday. Judge Philip Shorrock said the ""serious and commercial operation"" nearly succeeded in bringing an ""enormous haul"" of cocaine into the UK. Border Force officers found 500kg of the drug in 15 suitcases He said, while the four did not mastermind the operation, they played a ""crucial part"" in the hope of walking away with a ""substantial"" amount of money. NCA senior manager Steve McIntyre called the January seizure ""an audacious smuggling attempt"" which highlighted ""a border vulnerability"". He said: ""There are over 3,000 airports or airstrips in the UK and there's no way on this earth that any law enforcement agency is going to be able to man those all the time. ""By working collaboratively, we are making headway now. It's about intelligent policing and profiling better."" Mr McIntyre said, despite being bricklayers, the Neil brothers and their co-defendants ""lived an interesting lifestyle of lavish motor vehicles to get them to the aircraft"". He said: ""They were using the charity as a cover story, saying they were dealing in cryptocurrency and they were involved in the music industry and that was part of their VIP story."" X-ray pictures retrieved from a previous trip appeared to show suitcases full of bank notes In 2016, the Independent Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration raised concerns that customs checks at smaller airports were not rigorous enough, including at Farnborough. Monique Wrench, deputy director of Border Force Heathrow, which also looks after Farnborough, said: ""We've taken that report incredibly seriously and upped our effort."" The Farnborough seizure, she said, demonstrated Border Force officers could pick out passengers and bags which looked suspicious for further checks. She added the haul had been ""an amazing morale boost"". ""This is one of the largest seizures in our region's history and it's a day we want to celebrate,"" she said.

"This video can not be played A law professor outlines President Trump's perilous legal situation US President Donald Trump has responded to speculation that he might be impeached by warning that any such move would damage the economy. In an interview with Fox & Friends, he said the market would crash and ""everybody would be very poor"". He was speaking after Michael Cohen, his ex-lawyer, pleaded guilty to violating election laws and said he had been directed to do so by Mr Trump. Mr Trump has rarely spoken about the prospect of being impeached. How easy is it to impeach a president? Impeachment can of worms Correspondents say it is unlikely Mr Trump's opponents would try to impeach him before November's mid-term elections. ""I don't know how you can impeach somebody who's done a great job,"" Mr Trump told Fox and Friends. ""I tell you what, if I ever got impeached, I think the market would crash, I think everybody would be very poor."" Pointing to his head, he said: ""Because without this thinking, you would see numbers that you wouldn't believe in reverse."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Cohen says he handled hush money payments to two women during the 2016 presidential campaign. The two women, thought to be porn star Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal, both claimed they had affairs with Mr Trump, Under oath, Cohen said he had paid the money ""at the direction"" of Mr Trump, ""for the principal purpose of influencing the election"". This video can not be played Trump voter: ""Everybody lies"" However, Mr Trump insisted the two payments had not broken election campaign rules. He said that the payments had come from him personally, not from the campaign, but he had not known about them until ""later on"". In July,Cohen released audio tapes of him and Mr Trump allegedly discussing one of the paymentsbefore the election. The president also accused Cohen of making up stories to receive a lighter sentence. He added: ""And by the way, he pled to two counts that aren't a crime, which nobody understands. ""In fact, I watched a number of [TV] shows. Sometimes you get some pretty good information by watching shows. Those two counts aren't even a crime. They weren't campaign finance."" Later, US media reported that prosecutors in the Cohen case had granted federal immunity to the chairman of the company that publishes the National Enquirer tabloid, David Pecker. In the lead-up to the 2016 presidential election, Ms McDougal sold her story to the Enquirer, which is owned by a personal friend of Mr Trump. She says the $150,000 (Â£115,000) agreement gave the tabloid exclusive story rights and banned her from talking publicly about the alleged affair. The Enquirer did not publish her kiss-and-tell, and she says she was tricked. The hush money payments were not reported to the Federal Election Commission during the campaign. The question is whether the payments were made to protect Mr Trump's personal reputation or to protect his image as a presidential candidate. Under US election rules, any payments made with the aim of influencing a vote must be reported. 'I don't care if Trump paid off a porn star' Trumpland's crazy Tuesday, blow by blow Trump's chances of weathering the storm Who's who in the drama to end all dramas If Mr Trump were to be prosecuted over the money - not through the normal courts, because he is the sitting president, but conceivably in Congress, through an impeachment process - investigators would have to prove that he had indeed given the money to Cohen for electoral reasons. In his first public comments, back in April, about his alleged affair with Stormy Daniels, Mr Trump denied knowing about the $130,000 (Â£100,000) payment made to the actress via Cohen. Ms Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, alleges that she and Mr Trump had sex in a hotel room in 2006. Asked by a reporter in the press cabin of Air Force One if he had any knowledge about where Cohen had got the money to pay Ms Daniels, the president responded at the time: ""I don't know."" The conflicting statements in the Stormy Daniels saga The following month, Mr Trump officially disclosed a payment to Cohen of between $100,001 and $250,000 for expenses incurred in 2016. Analysis by ChrisBuckler, BBC News, Washington A president who often seems defiant and even dismissive is for the moment on the defensive. It is a sign of the pressure on Donald Trump that he is not only having to answer questions about the possibility of impeachment, but having to make economic arguments against it. Control of Congress has now become a crucial issue because the House of Representatives would need to vote to impeach a sitting president. For the moment he is protected by the dominance of the Republicans in Congress, but the party looks nervous and unsettled after a week that has truly rocked Washington. Two former members of the president's inner circle being convicted of serious crimes would be scandal enough, but to have one of them point a finger of blame directly at Mr Trump makes this a truly trying time. Some of his answers in the Fox and Friends interview were less than convincing, particularly as he tried to distance himself from his former personal lawyer Michael Cohen and the payments he arranged. However, past experience has shown that it takes a lot to shake the belief and devotion of Mr Trump's supporters.

"Jeff Sessions has been a frequent target of Mr Trump's very public ire US Attorney General Jeff Sessions has responded to Donald Trump's latest attack on him by insisting that the justice department he heads will not bend to political pressure. The apparent rebuke of Mr Trump came after the president said Mr Sessions was not in control of his department. Mr Trump has been vociferous in his criticism of the Department of Justice. He has been particularly riled by its handling of the inquiry into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Mr Sessions, an early supporter of Mr Trump's campaign, has stepped aside from that inquiry to avoid a potential conflict of interest and handed control to his deputy, Rod Rosenstein. That decision by Mr Sessions, and the ongoing progress of the inquiry under special counsel Robert Mueller - which is also reportedly now looking into whether Mr Trump has attempted to obstruct justice - have provoked frequent outbursts from the president, both in person and on his Twitter feed. The president remains insistent that there was no collusion between his campaign and the Russian government, and denies he has attempted to obstruct justice. Impeach me and the market crashes - Trump After the latest exchanges, two key Republican senators signalled that they would support Mr Trump if he were to fire Mr Sessions after the November mid-term elections. However, otherRepublicans told Politico they thought this would be a bad move,externaland said they were standing by the attorney general. ""I took control of the Department of Justice the day I was sworn in,"" the attorney general said in a statement. ""While I am attorney general, the actions of the Department of Justice will not be improperly influenced by political considerations. ""I demand the highest standards, and where they are not met, I take action."" He added: ""No nation has a more talented, more dedicated group of law enforcement investigators and prosecutors than the United States. ""I am proud to serve with them and proud of the work we have done in successfully advancing the rule of law."" Previously, Mr Sessions had been largely non-committal following criticism of him by the president, who appears to believe that Mr Sessions should have shown him greater loyalty instead of recusing himself from the Russia inquiry. In an earlier interview with the Fox and Friends programme, Mr Trump said:  ""I put in an attorney general that never took control of the justice department. Jeff Sessions never took control of the justice department and it's a sort of an incredible thing."" Turning to the Russia inquiry, the president said: ""Jeff Sessions recused himself, which he shouldn't have done. Or he should have told me [before I appointed him]. ""Even my enemies say that Jeff Sessions should have told you that he was going to recuse himself, and then you wouldn't have put him in. He took the job and then he said I'm going to recuse myself.  I said: 'What kind of a man is this?' ""You know the only reason I gave him the job? Because I felt loyalty, he was an original supporter. He was on the campaign.  He knows there was no collusion."" By Tara McKelvey, White House reporter Jeff Sessions was originally brought into the Trump campaign because of his hardline views on immigration. A stubborn man, Mr Sessions fought for decades for anti-immigration policies. Still, he has a gentle manner. I've seen him greeting colleagues with a shy smile at White House events. Mr Trump prides himself on never giving up, and he admires grit and determination in others - and found those traits in Mr Sessions. But now he is driving President Trump crazy. Mr Sessions is just as determined as Mr Trump is - and also refuses to back down. Only Mr Sessions is guided by a set of bedrock conservative principles, rather than the egotism and quicksilver impulses that fuel Mr Trump's tweets and, increasingly, his TV interviews. For these reasons Mr Sessions is a formidable enemy, and the battle between these two men could be long. Mr Sessions made his statement during a fraught week for the White House. This video can not be played A law professor outlines President Trump's perilous legal situation Two days ago, in the most dramatic developments yet linked to the Russia inquiry, former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort was found guilty of tax and bank fraud and Mr Trump's former personal lawyer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to crimes including tax evasion, bank fraud and campaign finance violations. Trumpland's crazy Tuesday, blow by blow Under oath, Cohen said he had been directed by Mr Trump to organise secret payments to silence two women who claimed they had affairs with the then Republican presidential candidate, violating campaign finance laws. Mr Trump has denied he broke the law. The sense that the president's legal troubles are growing were not dampened by Thursday's US media reports that prosecutors in the Cohen case had granted immunity from prosecution to the chairman of the company that publishes the National Enquirer, David Pecker, a friend of Mr Trump. In the lead-up to the 2016 presidential election, Playboy model Karen McDougal sold her story of her alleged affair with Mr Trump to the Enquirer. The contract she signed gave the tabloid exclusive story rights and banned her from talking publicly about the alleged affair. The story was never published. Despite the sense of crisis, it is generally believed that the Department of Justice is very unlikely to bring charges against a sitting president. And correspondents say it is unlikely Mr Trump's opponents would try to impeach him before the mid-term elections. How easy is it to impeach a president? Impeachment can of worms Trump's chances of weathering the storm Who's who in the drama to end all dramas Mr Trump's most fervent supporters, what he refers to as his ""base"" outside the political cauldron of Washington DC, seem unfazed by the latest developments. During the Fox News interview that was aired on Thursday, the president: Responded to speculation that he might be impeached by warning that any such move would damage the economy Insisted that payments to two women alleging they had affairs with him had not broken election campaign rules Attacked the ""flipping"" process - whereby prosecutors promise a suspect a short sentence in exchange for co-operation - as ""not fair"" and something that ""almost ought to be outlawed"" Claimed that Cohen avoided up to 20 years in jail because ""if you can say something bad about Donald Trump... you'll go down to two years or three years, which is the deal he made"" Said he would award himself an ""A-plus"" grade for his work as president so far.

"GCSE pass rates in England, Wales and Northern Ireland have risen this year - despite an overhaul to make the exams more demanding. The proportion of students reaching the pass levels - England's new grade 4 and grade C in Wales and Northern Ireland - is up by 0.5% to 66.9%. For the first time most of the GCSEs in England are being graded from 9 to 1. About 4% of entries received the top grade 9 - and 732 pupils scored a clean sweep of grade 9s in all subjects. Girls continued to do better than boys - in terms of both the highest grades and in the pass rate. But the gender gap has narrowed this year with boys catching up. In total, 17.2% of boys' entries scored an A or a 7, up from 16.4% last year, while girls' remained static at 23.7%. GCSE grades not what you had hoped for? Help is at hand How do the new grades 9 to 1 work? GCSE results live page This video can not be played GCSE students celebrate their results About 90% of entries in England this year were in the tougher form of GCSE, with more difficult content and mostly marked on final exams, rather than coursework. The intention is to pitch the exams at the standard of the highest-achieving countries in education, such as Singapore and Finland. Pupils in Wales and Northern Ireland continue to get their results graded from A* to G. A total of 20 of the most popular GCSE subjects in England have been graded for the first time in the numerical format - plus English and maths, which were introduced in the new format last year. These include history, geography, sciences and modern languages, all of which have been designed to be more difficult. Of those achieving all grade 9s - and taking at least seven of the new GCSEs - almost two-thirds were girls. Only 732 pupils out of more than half a million candidates had a clean sweep of the top grades. Kevin Courtney of the National Education Union said ""success is being rationed"" with fewer people getting the new top grade compared with the previous A*. Despite the changes, exam regulators have wanted to maintain stability with previous years, and prevent a ""guinea pig"" cohort from being disadvantaged. This means that the overall pass rate - combining more than five million entries in England, Wales and Northern Ireland - has stayed broadly similar, up by 0.5 percentage point to 66.9% compared with last year. The proportion getting the equivalent of an A grade and above - now grades 7, 8 and 9 - has also remained similar, at about 20%. This has meant much lower grade boundaries for some subjects. For one exam board, the grade 4 pass mark for maths was about 21%, chemistry 26% and biology 27%. This video can not be played What happens next: Advice on GCSE results and beyond To reach the pass mark in English literature, pupils had to score 42%. Sarah Robertson of the Royal Society of Chemistry said the grade boundaries in the sciences raised concerns about exam papers being ""barely accessible to the lower attaining students"". As long as teenagers are in full-time education in England, they must retake English and maths until they get at least a grade 4. This year, 161,000 students aged 17 or older - so those likely to be candidates who were resitting - took maths GCSE and 149,000 English language. In England, most of the results this year are in new 9 to 1 grades But of these, only 22.7% achieved a 4 grade in maths and 33.1% a 4 in English. The private equity foundation, Impetus-PEF, said thousands of young people were being let down, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds. Chief executive Andy Ratcliffe said thousands of youngsters were ""stuck in an endless cycle of resits"". From cake shop to civil servant - without A-levels Why are students changing subject choices? Selina Wang from Burgess Hill Girls school achieved nine grade 9s - one of 732 such high achieving pupils Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, said there should be more focus on the youngsters who scored at the lower end of the scale. ""Under the old GCSE, if you got an F or a G, whilst you may not have felt particularly pleased with it, there wasn't a national narrative saying 'you have failed to get the standard pass, you have failed to get a strong pass', yet that is now built in. ""I just think we have to rethink what our education system is trying to do. If we had a more global outlook, our starting point would be, like all of those competitors of ours, what do we need to do so that those 11 years of teaching help every child to have something? It might not be a GCSE, but something. ""That's where the reform should have been."" Pupils in Northern Ireland get results graded A*-G Sally Collier, head of the exam regulator Ofqual, said: ""Students picking up their results today can be confident they have achieved the grades their performances deserve."" School Standards Minister Nick Gibb said: ""Education standards are rising in our schools and pupils have shown their abilities by achieving excellent results today.""

"Friday afternoon and evening will see some of the heaviest congestion of the bank holiday weekend Drivers are being warned to expect delays of up to an hour on motorways on Friday ahead of the August bank holiday. Most roadworks on motorways and major roads in England will be lifted but about 40 sets will remain for safety reasons. Experts predict roads will become congested from 14:00 BST on Friday as holidaymakers mix with commuters. Rail engineering work means there will be no trains to and from London Euston. Most direct Virgin Trains services between the capital and the north-west of England have been cancelled with remaining services terminating at Milton Keynes. Journeys on the M5 between junctions four (Bromsgrove) and one (West Bromwich) from 09:30 to 14:00 on Friday could take four times longer than usual to travel, about one hour and 21 minutes instead of the average 21 minutes. The M20 in Kent, junctions nine to three, could take more than an hour for a journey normally lasting 22 minutes. The peak time is expected to be 07:30 to 09:30 and affects drivers heading towards the Channel Tunnel and Port of Dover. On Saturday, journey times on the M1 between Leicester and Nottingham are expected to rise from a normal 16 minutes to just over an hour, particularly between 14:30 and 17:00. The stretch includes eight miles of roadworks that are not being lifted. In Newport, Wales, drivers on the M4 between junctions 29 and 24 could take half an hour to cover a journey that normally lasts about 13 minutes. The peak time on Friday is 10:30 to 17:30. In Northern Ireland on Saturday, the 6.4 mile stretch of the A6 from Eden River to Dungiven may take 35 minutes instead of the usual 10. And in Scotland, where there is no bank holiday this weekend, drivers are warned the M8 A725 in Belshill to the A779 at Bathgate might take about 39 minutes instead of a normal 25 on Sunday. The predictions by the RAC and transport analysts Inrix are based on data for previous bank holidays, planned construction and road closures, events and weather forecasts. RAC spokesman Rod Dennis said drivers should also expect the Almondsbury interchange at Bristol, where the M5 and M4 meet, to be busy. ""As tens of thousands of drivers head for Devon and Cornwall the coming-together of traffic leads to regular tailbacks every Friday afternoon,"" he said. ""Add a bank holiday and some sunshine into the mix and it's the perfect recipe for a long wait on the motorway."" 300 miles of roadworks will be lifted or finished by 06:00 on Friday Highways England said it would lift or finish roadworks on motorways and major roads by 06:00 on Friday. It said 97% of the network would be clear but has left about 40 sets in place for safety reasons. About 150,000 people usually use London Euston at a weekend Trains will be disrupted by 400 sets of engineering work taking place over the weekend. It means: No trains to or from London Euston from Saturday to Monday or the following weekend, 1-2 September. No trains at Bolton from Saturday until Friday 31 August and replacement buses running between Manchester, Preston, Wigan and Blackburn Replacement buses between Coventry, Leamington Spa and Birmingham International, affecting Birmingham Airport passengers, from Saturday until 12:00 on Monday Replacement buses between Crewe and Liverpool South Parkway from Saturday to Monday Peter Broadley, Virgin Trains executive director, said: ""With no services into or out of Euston we strongly advise our customers to avoid travelling to London on the days affected."" Passengers can check their services withNational Rail Enquiries,external Network Rail says it uses bank holidays for major engineering work as this is when fewer people travel by train. Strike action at Liverpool John Lennon Airport, involving about 80 members of the GMB union, starts at 19:00 on Thursday and is due to continue until 07:00 on Saturday.

"A private school says it's seeking legal advice after getting complaints about a ""highly inappropriate"" music video filmed on its grounds. Stefflon Don used Mill Hill School to film the video for her new song Pretty Girl. One scene depicts the rapper smoking cannabis in her dorm, and she can also be seen swearing at another student. The school has apologised and says it is ""investigating"" how the video was allowed to be made. Mill Hill School is an independent school in North London. In the video for Pretty Girl, Mobo winner Stefflon Don plays a new girl entering a pretty unwelcoming environment. After struggling to make friends, the 26-year-old gets into a very sweary argument with another student during a row on the football pitch and appears naked in a shower scene. Finally she appears to make some friends when she depicts getting high in her dorm room with some other girls. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

""The message being sent by this video popularises everything which good schools should be against - drug-taking, swearing, and overt sexuality,"" Chris McGovern said. ""These are all things which schools should be trying to guide pupils away from, not promoting them. Parents who are paying fees for their children to go there will be appalled."" The school says it gives permission for shoots on its grounds so that it can raise money for its ""charitable objectives"". In a statement it said: ""The head and the governors are investigating how a highly inappropriate film was allowed to be made at the school. ""We include in all hire agreements the requirement that parties should not bring the school into disrepute, and we are seeking legal advice on the matter."" It's not clear whether the school knew about the content of the film before accepting the booking but they say ""strict controls are in place"" and that in this case ""these controls were breached"".

"British Airways and Air France have announced that they will stop flying to Iran next month. Both airlines said that the route was ""not commercially viable."" The reintroduction of US sanctions has caused a slump in the value of the Iranian currency, the rial, making it harder for Iranians to travel overseas. BA restarted the service to Tehran two years ago after a four-year gap. The last flight will be on 22 September, returning the next day. The airline apologised to travellers planning to travel to Iran and said it was offering refunds for affected customers or a possible rerouting through other airlines. Air France, which had transferred its connections with Tehran to its low-cost airline Joon, had reduced the frequency of the flights from three to one a week since the beginning of this month. It will stop all flights on 18 September. KLM said last month that it would also suspend flights from Amsterdam to Iran from September. The sanctions, prompted partly by Washington's decision in May to abandon the Iran nuclear deal, have prompted many western firms to step back from business in Iran. Companies such as the French energy giant Total, German insurer Allianz and Danish tanker operator Maersk have said they are preparing to wind down their operations in Iran.

"A yoga ball was found in the boot of a locked car in which Mr Khaw's wife and daughter were found dead An anaesthetist killed his wife and 16-year-old daughter using a yoga ball filled with carbon monoxide, a Hong Kong court has heard. Prosecutors said Khaw Kim-sun left the inflatable ball in the boot of a car where the gas leaked out and killed them. The pair were found dead inside a locked car in 2015, in a case that initially baffled police. Mr Khaw has pleaded not guilty to two counts of murder. A post-mortem examination showed his wife and eldest daughter had died from carbon monoxide poisoning. Police found a deflated yoga ball in the back of the yellow Mini Cooper in which their bodies were discovered. Prosecutors told Hong Kong's High Court that Mr Khaw had deliberately plotted to kill his wife because he was having an affair and she would not grant him a divorce, the South China Morning Post said. But they said it was unlikely he wanted to kill his daughter. He allegedly told his younger daughter to stay at home to complete homework. Colorado dad charged with killing family How this photo solved a fatal hit-and-run Iowa suspect 'forgot dead jogger in car' Eyewitnesses said they saw Mr Khaw, an associate professor at Hong Kong's Chinese University, filling two balls with carbon monoxide, reports said. He told colleagues he was going to kill rabbits with the gas, but reports say he contradicted himself by telling police he wanted to use it to get rid of rats at his home. The trial continues.

"This video can not be played A law professor outlines President Trump's perilous legal situation US President Donald Trump has responded to speculation that he might be impeached by warning that any such move would damage the economy. In an interview with Fox & Friends, he said the market would crash and ""everybody would be very poor"". He was speaking after Michael Cohen, his ex-lawyer, pleaded guilty to violating election laws and said he had been directed to do so by Mr Trump. Mr Trump has rarely spoken about the prospect of being impeached. How easy is it to impeach a president? Impeachment can of worms Correspondents say it is unlikely Mr Trump's opponents would try to impeach him before November's mid-term elections. ""I don't know how you can impeach somebody who's done a great job,"" Mr Trump told Fox and Friends. ""I tell you what, if I ever got impeached, I think the market would crash, I think everybody would be very poor."" Pointing to his head, he said: ""Because without this thinking, you would see numbers that you wouldn't believe in reverse."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Cohen says he handled hush money payments to two women during the 2016 presidential campaign. The two women, thought to be porn star Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal, both claimed they had affairs with Mr Trump, Under oath, Cohen said he had paid the money ""at the direction"" of Mr Trump, ""for the principal purpose of influencing the election"". This video can not be played Trump voter: ""Everybody lies"" However, Mr Trump insisted the two payments had not broken election campaign rules. He said that the payments had come from him personally, not from the campaign, but he had not known about them until ""later on"". In July,Cohen released audio tapes of him and Mr Trump allegedly discussing one of the paymentsbefore the election. The president also accused Cohen of making up stories to receive a lighter sentence. He added: ""And by the way, he pled to two counts that aren't a crime, which nobody understands. ""In fact, I watched a number of [TV] shows. Sometimes you get some pretty good information by watching shows. Those two counts aren't even a crime. They weren't campaign finance."" Later, US media reported that prosecutors in the Cohen case had granted federal immunity to the chairman of the company that publishes the National Enquirer tabloid, David Pecker. In the lead-up to the 2016 presidential election, Ms McDougal sold her story to the Enquirer, which is owned by a personal friend of Mr Trump. She says the $150,000 (Â£115,000) agreement gave the tabloid exclusive story rights and banned her from talking publicly about the alleged affair. The Enquirer did not publish her kiss-and-tell, and she says she was tricked. The hush money payments were not reported to the Federal Election Commission during the campaign. The question is whether the payments were made to protect Mr Trump's personal reputation or to protect his image as a presidential candidate. Under US election rules, any payments made with the aim of influencing a vote must be reported. 'I don't care if Trump paid off a porn star' Trumpland's crazy Tuesday, blow by blow Trump's chances of weathering the storm Who's who in the drama to end all dramas If Mr Trump were to be prosecuted over the money - not through the normal courts, because he is the sitting president, but conceivably in Congress, through an impeachment process - investigators would have to prove that he had indeed given the money to Cohen for electoral reasons. In his first public comments, back in April, about his alleged affair with Stormy Daniels, Mr Trump denied knowing about the $130,000 (Â£100,000) payment made to the actress via Cohen. Ms Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, alleges that she and Mr Trump had sex in a hotel room in 2006. Asked by a reporter in the press cabin of Air Force One if he had any knowledge about where Cohen had got the money to pay Ms Daniels, the president responded at the time: ""I don't know."" The conflicting statements in the Stormy Daniels saga The following month, Mr Trump officially disclosed a payment to Cohen of between $100,001 and $250,000 for expenses incurred in 2016. Analysis by ChrisBuckler, BBC News, Washington A president who often seems defiant and even dismissive is for the moment on the defensive. It is a sign of the pressure on Donald Trump that he is not only having to answer questions about the possibility of impeachment, but having to make economic arguments against it. Control of Congress has now become a crucial issue because the House of Representatives would need to vote to impeach a sitting president. For the moment he is protected by the dominance of the Republicans in Congress, but the party looks nervous and unsettled after a week that has truly rocked Washington. Two former members of the president's inner circle being convicted of serious crimes would be scandal enough, but to have one of them point a finger of blame directly at Mr Trump makes this a truly trying time. Some of his answers in the Fox and Friends interview were less than convincing, particularly as he tried to distance himself from his former personal lawyer Michael Cohen and the payments he arranged. However, past experience has shown that it takes a lot to shake the belief and devotion of Mr Trump's supporters.

"Brexit Secretary Dominic Raabhas set out what he called ""practical and proportionate"" advice in case the UK leaves the EU with ""no deal"". Ministers say a deal is the most likely outcome but the government has published25 documents of guidance for people and businesses across a variety of areas,externalto try to avoid the ""short-term disruption"" which it admits is possible if the two sides cannot reach a deal. Reality Check: What would 'no-deal' look like? Fox: No-deal most likely Brexit outcome Scottish government warns against 'no-deal' Brexit Brexit: The key dates ahead BBC correspondents have unpicked some of the key details of the newly-published papers. The details on ""no deal"" published by the government are sobering. Just take one - trade across the border between the UK and the EU post-Brexit if there is no agreement. If there is no deal and Britain reverts to ""third country"" status, the government has provided a long list of preparations that firms which export and import to and from the EU will be required to undertake. Customs declarations would be needed, tariffs (import and export taxes) ""may also become due"" and the government also says firms are likely to need to invest in new computer systems to track goods. ""If the UK left the EU on 29 March 2019 without a deal, there would be immediate changes to the procedures that apply to businesses trading with the EU. It would mean that the free circulation of goods between the UK and EU would cease,"" the government says. That is the crux of the problem. Leaving the single market and the customs union without a deal means significantly higher barriers to trade with the EU. And higher costs for firms that are engaged in that trade. Some of the overall costs to the economy might be mitigated over the medium term by increased trading opportunities with nations outside the EU. And the government has signalled that in some areas - such as the need for upfront payments of VAT on imports - it is doing its best to smooth the impact on cash flow by allowing for delayed payment systems. That has been welcomed by business groups. But what is key from the documents published on Thursday is pretty straightforward. The costs of ""no deal"" are likely to be substantial. And consumers and businesses would be the ones paying the bill. Read more from Kamal Not so long ago, anyone going online to buy a flight, clothes, or even just a new spade could have been hit with a surcharge simply for the luxury of paying by credit card, debit card, or using a digital service such as PayPal. The government described them as ""rip-off fees"" and in January they were made illegal as the UK adopted EU rules. In a ""no-deal"" scenario the government says those surcharges could return for anyone in the UK buying something from a retailer in the EU - something that happens regularly through online shopping. Equally, any transaction across the border could become slower as UK financial services could no longer plug into the EU's payments system. Those UK expats living and drawing a pension in Europe may also be affected. As the Association of British Insurers (ABI) has warned, there is a risk that, without an agreement, a UK insurance company paying - say - an annuity to a UK expat in the EU would no longer be authorised to do so. That pension provider would either have to risk a fine by carrying on making these payments, would have to set up a subsidiary in the EU to do so, or could do a deal with a European counterpart. The ABI argues that a relatively simple co-operation between UK and EU regulators could solve this issue, and allow people to continue drawing pensions and receiving insurance payouts. The UK government said it would give temporary permission for financial firms in the European Economic Area to pay people in the UK. Roaming charges: What will happen after Brexit? The concern in some parts of the NHS and the pharmaceutical industry is what might happen in a ""no-deal"" scenario if supply lines for medicines are disrupted. If lorries get stuck at Calais and Dover because of customs delays, vital drugs like insulin needed in the NHS might be held up. The UK currently imports more than 37 million packets of medicines each month Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock has now written to NHS and social care organisations saying there is no need for hospitals, GPs and pharmacies to stockpile medicines or for doctors to write longer-dated prescriptions. He says pharmaceutical companies should have six weeks' supplies built up to avoid any possible disruption. To that end he has written to the companies asking them to clarify their plans for having these supplies. NHS and industry leaders have welcomed the extra clarity provided by ministers with Thursday's documents. They are pleased the government will allow drugs and devices tested elsewhere in the EU to be used in the UK. But they say stockpiling six weeks' worth of medicines will not be straightforward with only 200 days to go until Britain leaves the EU. Brexit: NHS managers warn about impact of no deal Brexit: What would 'no-deal' mean for food and medicine? The big Brexit question for farmers is not answered in Thursday's documents: will there be frictionless trade for the Â£45bn in agricultural produce we exchange with the EU? The National Farmers Union (NFU) has talked of an ""Armageddon"" in agriculture if there's no deal. ""This is what's keeping us awake at night,"" one NFU official told me. But one of the papers does give a taste of potential challenges to come. It covers organic food and highlights the need for a new process of certification. When Britain leaves the EU, British organic food will have to be certified by UK bodies which will themselves have to be recognised by the EU. That's a task that can take up to nine months, the document warns, and it may not be possible to start it until Britain actually becomes a ""third country"". But without going through these hoops, Britain's organic farmers will not be able to export across the Channel. The NFU describes this as a ""cliff-edge"" scenario. The Soil Association says delays could significantly hinder trade. There's another concern as well: the EU currently runs a system for tracing organic produce and the UK will need to set up its own version. Many wonder if that will be ready by next April. Post-Brexit farming funding set out by Michael Gove One line in the technical note on research is ringing alarm bells. It spells out that when Britain is not a member of the EU, it will no longer be eligible for grants from the prestigious European Research Council (ERC). While non-EU countries can take part in the much larger Horizon 2020 programme - and the government says it hopes that Britain will - the ERC, which is worth 17% of the total, will be closed to them. This could matter hugely to dozens of researchers up and down the country. A lab at the Francis Crick Institute is exploring new vaccines against cancer and has just started to receive a five-year ERC grant of â¬2.5m. Would a ""no-deal"" Brexit mean that that flow of funding would stop at the end of March? The possible implications of a ""no-deal"" scenario for the Culham Centre for Fusion Energy are not clear Another set of concerns is uncertainty over nuclear research as Britain leaves the Euratom treaty which covers radioactive materials. Whether it's nuclear fuel or radioactive isotopes for medical use, arrangements will pass into UK hands. Operators ""may"" need to apply for licences for trade with the EU, the government says. And the fate of Europe's fusion research centre at Culham in Oxfordshire is addressed but left unclear. Brexit barriers 'would harm science', say universities Does it matter if the UK leaves Euratom? The EU has been publishing its own preparedness advice for months now, for all Brexit outcomes. On Thursday, EU officials pointed out, as they have done many times before, that ""the withdrawal of the UK is going to lead to disruption, regardless. So with a deal or without a deal. That's why everybody, and in particular economic operators, need to be prepared"". The impacts highlighted by the UK's notices for a ""no-deal"" scenario are, the EU side says, the ""automatic, mechanical"" effect of the UK quitting the EU and moving outside the single market and the customs union and all their associated rules and regulations. In the event of a no deal, the impact will be felt on Brexit day in March next year. EU sources say their efforts right now are going into negotiating a withdrawal treaty, as that is the way to mitigate a ""no-deal"" scenario. The EU's own notices say it will be bound, legally, to treat the UK as a ""third country"" after Brexit, and that will limit any ability to waive EU rules and regulations especially for the country. Which puts the focus back on the issues still holding up the withdrawal treaty, such as the so-called ""Irish backstop"", if a ""no deal"" is to be avoided.

"This video can not be played Dominic Raab is asked about what no Brexit deal would mean for EU nationals living in the UK The UK will ""move swiftly"" to safeguard the future of EU citizens in the event of no deal being agreed, Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab has said. After talks in Brussels, he told the BBC the UK had a ""moral obligation"" to people and it was ""inconceivable"" they would be ""turfed out"". The EU, he said, must match the UK's ""ambition and pragmatism"" if the gaps between them were to be overcome. Counterpart Michel Barnier warned of a ""blame game"" over a no deal outcome. Mr Barnier said fundamental disagreements remained on future economic issues and the EU would not abandon its principles when it came to the integrity of the single market. The two sides have agreed that talks will continue without interruption to try to secure a deal in advance of the UK's departure on 29 March 2019. Mr Barnier indicated a deal may be pushed back until early November. Government to publish no-deal Brexit advice NHS 'not prepared' for no-deal Brexit In recent weeks there has been an increasing focus on the possibility of no deal being reached, and on Thursday the government is to publish a series of technical notices aimed at preparing for this scenario. Mr Raab dismissed what he said were ""hair-raising scare stories"", promising Thursday's documents would provide clarity. Asked whether the UK would guarantee the future of EU workers if there was no deal, Mr Raab said in the ""unlikely eventuality"" that this happened, the UK would ""move swiftly to secure their position"". ""We hugely value the contribution of EU citizens here in the UK and I am confident that in the unlikely eventuality that we don't have a deal, we will move swiftly to secure their position,"" he said. Dominic Raab and Michel Barnier will hold more talks next week ""It is inconceivable we would do anything other than make sure that they are legally in a position where they're secure to stay,"" he said, adding that ""we are talking about real people...and we have got a moral obligation"". He added: ""There's no question that we're going to see EU citizens turfed out. We've made that clear in the past. I've made that clear in the past, I'm happy to give that reassurance today."" Mr Raab told the BBC that the two sides needed to ""step up the ante"" and he would be returning to Brussels next week to ensure momentum was not lost. He said a ""workable solution"" was needed to address the concerns of communities on both sides of the Irish border. At a press conference earlier, the EU's negotiator said his goal was to strike a future partnership of ""unprecedented"" scope with the UK. But he warned progress on trade and economic co-operation lagged behind that on security and defence issues and said the EU would not compromise the integrity of the single market. Mr Barnier said the question of the Irish border must be ""de-dramatised"" with the onus on both sides to make clear ""which controls are needed where and how this should be done"". He added: ""Our challenge for the coming weeks is to try and define an ambitious partnership between the UK and the EU - a partnership that has no precedent. ""This partnership has to respect the single market and the foundations of the European project, and if this is well understood we can conclude the negotiations successfully.""

"Britain leaving the European Union has been described as akin to attempting to remove an egg from an omelette. Today's ""no deal"" papers reveal the complicated exercise could carry significant costs for consumers and businesses if Britain and the EU fail to agree on a transition period and a subsequent trading agreement. Those increased costs would be very likely to have a negative impact on the economy and could mean higher prices in the shops as firms pass on the higher costs of doing business. Which is why the government keeps insisting that it is pushing for a ""successful"" deal with the EU. And the EU says that is also its preferred outcome - Britain is a major customer for many EU goods and services. Many firms I speak to are not preparing for a ""no deal"" because they simply do not believe that it will happen, such is the disruption that could be caused. Food imports and exports would be particularly affected by a no-deal scenario The details on ""no deal"" published by the government are sobering. Just take one - trade across the border between the UK and the EU post-Brexit if there is no agreement. If there is no deal and Britain reverts to ""third country"" status, the government has provided a long list of preparations firms that export and import to and from the EU will be required to undertake.

""If the UK left the EU on 29 March 2019 without a deal there would be immediate changes to the procedures that apply to businesses trading with the EU. It would mean that the free circulation of goods between the UK and EU would cease,"" the government says. UK publishes 'no deal' Brexit advice Reality Check: What would 'no deal' look like? Brexit: The key dates ahead The import and export of food would be particularly affected. Food companies would have to register with a new (and as yet non-existent) UK authority which would be needed to replace the EU's ""TRACES"" system that tracks the trade and certification process for animals, food, feed and plants across Europe. ""The new burdens potentially facing food and drink exporters and importers set out today will frighten many SME [small and medium-sized] food businesses,"" the Food and Drink Federation's chief executive, Ian Wright, said. Holidays in Europe could become more expensive That is the crux of the problem. Leaving the single market and the customs union without a deal means significantly higher barriers to trade with the EU. And higher costs for firms that are engaged in that trade. Consumers could find going on holiday and making card payments for EU products more expensive because Britain would no longer be part of the EU's payments process. Some of the overall costs to the economy might be mitigated over the medium term by increased trading opportunities with nations outside the EU. And the government has signalled that in some areas - such as the need for upfront payments of VAT on imports - it is doing its best to smooth the impact on cash flow by allowing for delayed payment systems.

"When MPs return from their summer recess, Britain's departure from the EU will be fast approaching. Here are the key dates and parliamentary battles on the road to Brexit. 20 September- EU leaders are expected to discuss Brexit, although a full summit has been ruled out 17-18 October- EU summit. This has been seen as a deadline for an agreement setting out the terms of UK-EU ""divorce"" - the so-called withdrawal agreement - to allow enough time for the UK Parliament and the European Parliament to ratify it. A political declaration on the future relationship between the UK and the EU is also expected at this point November- The EU has suggested this month is the latest a deal could be finalised. There is speculation that an emergency EU summit on Brexit might be held in this month, if a withdrawal agreement and a declaration on the future relationship are not reached in October If a deal has been agreed, MPs will be asked to approve it 13-14 December- EU summit. If a deal has not been done by October, this is the fallback option if the two sides still want to reach an agreement Ratification of the withdrawal agreement by the UK Parliament and the European Parliament. 21 January- If the government has not presented its withdrawal agreement by this date, powers for MPs to influence ministers' next steps will kick in 21-22 March- The final summit that the UK is expected to attend as a member of the EU Before 29 March- Parliament will have to pass the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Bill to implement the withdrawal agreement, assuming it was approved by Parliament beforehand 29 March, at 2300 GMT- The UK leaves the EU. A special summit of the 27 other EU countries soon after the UK's exit is expected, but has not yet been scheduled 23-26MayElections for the European Parliament in 27 EU countries (the UK will no longer be represented in the parliament) 31 December- If all goes to plan, this will be the last date of the transition period What is it? If and when ministers return with a deal, MPs will vote on the withdrawal agreement and the framework for the future partnership. This will act as the ""meaningful vote"" promised to MPs by the prime minister. The rules surrounding what happens if things don't go to plan were written into law in the Withdrawal Act: In the event that MPs refuse to approve the withdrawal agreement or no deal is reached by 21 January 2019, the government will have to present its plans for next steps to Parliament. MPs will then be able to vote to endorse the statement. When? Soon after the withdrawal agreement has been finalised (expected by the end of October 2018). The government has said the vote will take place before the European Parliament votes on the agreement. Potential flashpoints This vote is potentially the biggest threat to the government's plans. Ministers have presented the vote as a decision between approving their withdrawal agreement and ""no deal"". Assuming the Opposition votes against the agreement, the government's fate will lie in the hands of its own backbenchers. MPs who support a hard Brexit, such as Jacob Rees-Mogg, have made it clear they would be prepared to vote against the deal if it does not prove sufficient, but the pro-Remain Conservatives could also join Labour in the voting lobbies if they are unconvinced. A complex but crucial factor is what happens in the case of no deal or Parliament's rejection of the deal. The final version of the Withdrawal Act stated that in the case of no deal by January or MPs rejecting a deal the government would have to present its new plans to MPs in a ""neutral motion"". This could be along the lines of ""This House has considered"" the government's plans for next steps, giving MPs little power to influence the plans. However, if Speaker John Bercow decides the motion is amendable, MPs could change its wording. They could theoretically change the motion to direct the government on their next steps. Please upgrade your browser What is it? Another law that needs to be passed before the UK leaves the EU. It will enshrine the withdrawal agreement in law and give legal effect to whatever transition period is agreed. The difference between this and the motion in Parliament is that the motion is there to approve the withdrawal agreement while the bill is there to implement it. When? The bill probably cannot be written until there is a withdrawal agreement and it must be passed before Brexit day (29 March 2019). MPs complicated the process in December when they passed an amendment to the Withdrawal Bill - proposed by Conservative MP Dominic Grieve - that would require this bill to be passed before the government can use secondary legislation to implement Brexit. This means the vote on this bill will act as another ""meaningful vote"". Potential flashpoints It is unclear what would happen if Parliament rejected the bill. What is it? Under the Withdrawal Bill, the government has the power to make changes to laws that need to happen before Brexit day. This is called secondary legislation and is often used to make small technical changes to laws. But opposition politicians have warned that excessive use of these powers could be undemocratic. When? The powers are contained in the Withdrawal Act. But after MPs voted for Mr Grieve's amendment, ministers will not be allowed to use the powers until the Withdrawal Agreement Bill has been passed. What is it? The final withdrawal agreement will have to be ratified as an international treaty. The government has to present international treaties to both Houses of Parliament. If neither House raises objections, the treaty is passed and does not necessarily have to be debated or voted on. If there is an objection, ministers have 21 days to explain the merits of the treaty, before presenting it to Parliament again. This could technically be repeated several times. When? The government has said the treaty will have to be ratified before the withdrawal agreement can ""enter into force"". Potential flashpoints It is unlikely that there would be a vote - or even a debate - on the treaty, seeing as the issues will have already been debated and voted on in the meaningful vote. Theoretically, Parliament could vote against the treaty, but it will not be able to amend it. Of course, this all depends on them having a treaty to ratifyâ¦ The EU and the UK have to agree on the terms of the UK's departure - as well as agreeing the outline for the trading relationship they will have after Brexit. A number of sticking points remain. Here are the main issues that need to be sorted out (there are a lot of smaller ones too -you can read more about those here). This is the biggest sticking point. Both sides have committed to avoiding the return of a hard border, including physical infrastructure or related checks and controls, between Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. They want to achieve this by agreeing a new trade deal with the continuation of open borders. But in the event that this is not possible both sides have agreed to have a ""backstop"" solution that would keep the Irish border open. Brussels' proposed solution would see Northern Ireland stick to those rules of the customs union and single market that are required for cross-border co-operation to continue. But the UK government is against this idea, saying it would effectively separate Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK and create a border in the Irish Sea. Instead the UK would like to see the backstop apply to the entire UK, but negotiators are yet to find a solution that is acceptable to both sides. Gibraltar and Cyprus The sides must still agree on what terms Gibraltar will be able to participate in the transition agreement. The EU's negotiating guidelines state that ""no agreement between the EU and the United Kingdom may apply to the territory of Gibraltar without the agreement between the Kingdom of Spain and the United Kingdom"", which some have interpreted as the EU giving the Spanish veto over the final deal. Madrid is said to be seeking joint management of Gibraltar's airport and greater co-operation on tax fraud and tobacco smuggling in return for allowing the withdrawal agreement to cover the Rock. The UK and the EU will also have to find a solution for British military bases in Cyprus. The UK has set store by establishing a high level of co-operation on security issues, like counter-terrorism and the fight against organised crime, with the EU after Brexit. But there are significant disagreements about how this will work - and the EU's decision to exclude the UK from the Galileo satellite system on security grounds was said by the UK to show a lack of trust. The UK thinks that co-operation on extradition, the British relationship with the EU crime-fighting agency Europol and the sharing of criminal records should be the subject of a separate security treaty which the two sides should begin negotiating straight away. UK wants Â£1bn Galileo costs back from EU Theresa May security pledge at EU summit This is another issue that could bring the whole deal down, according to Michel Barnier. The UK is committed to pulling out of the European Court of Justice, the mechanism used to settle disputes between member states by interpreting and enforcing single market rules - but it does want to stay close to some of the EU's rules. The EU has proposed a joint committee made up of representatives appointed by London and Brussels. If they can't solve a problem, it would be referred to the European Court of Justice. The UK government likes the idea of a joint committee but not of the European Court of Justice having the final say in all circumstances and only wants certain cases referred by the committee to the ECJ. This is how the Brexit process is meant to go - but the UK or the EU could pull the plug on talks at any time. And, in theory, the UK and the other 27 EU members could agree to change the timetable or even halt the process Brexit altogether. As the European Commission likes to say, ""nothing is agreed until everything is agreed"".

"Ant (left) won't be there for the next series of I'm A Celebrity... Declan Donnelly will have a new co-host on the next series of I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! as Ant McPartlin takes time off. Speaking at the Edinburgh TV Festival, ITV's director of television Kevin Lygo said they have decided on Dec's co-host, but would not reveal who it was. Antstepped down from his TV workin March to have treatment after his drink-driving arrest. It had been thought Dec would present the jungle reality show solo. Earlier in August,Ant saidhe would be taking the rest of the year off, and Saturday Night Takeaway would not return next year. Dec presented the final shows of Saturday Night Takeaway as well as the Britain's Got Talent live finals alone. The new series of I'm A Celebrity... is due to begin in November. When asked who Dec's co-presenter would be, Lygo joked: ""It's going to be Piers Morgan. No, I don't know, it could be Jeremy Corbyn. I can't say."" He added: ""The good news is that he [Ant]'s doing really well, he's doing everything he should be doing to get better. ""We collectively thought, let's give it a good amount of time off, this is a slow procedure, that's what we've decided to do.""

"The number of EU citizens moving to the UK has continued to decrease over the last year, figures show. EU net migration was 87,000 in the year to the end of March 2018, returning to a level last seen in 2012, according toOffice for National Statistics data,external. Overall net migration, the difference between the number of people coming to live in the UK for at least 12 months and those leaving, was 270,000. The government wants to cut overall net migration to below 100,000. Reality Check: Do we really know the scale of UK migration? 10 charts explaining the UK's immigration system Some 226,000 EU citizens came to the UK and 138,000 EU citizens left in the year to the end of March. ""Much of the recent fall is in people from the western European countries that make up the 'EU15' group coming to the UK for a definite job,"" said ONS statistician Nicola Rogers. Separate data from theLabour Force Survey,externalfor April to June 2018, shows there were 86,000 fewer EU nationals working in the UK than a year earlier. That represents the largest annual fall since comparable records began in 1997. Of those, the proportion of people aged from 16 to 64 years who were in work was 83.1% for EU nationals, higher than that for UK nationals (75.5%) and non-EU nationals (62.9%).

"This video can not be played Trump voter: ""Everybody lies"" US President Donald Trump has insisted that payments to two women who say he had affairs with them did not break election campaign rules. It comes after his ex-lawyer, Michael Cohen, pleaded guilty to violating laws during the 2016 presidential election over his handling of the hush money. Interviewed by Fox & Friends, Mr Trump said the payments had come from him personally, not from the campaign. He has in the past denied knowing about one of the payments altogether. 'I don't care if Trump paid off a porn star' Mr Trump also accused Cohen of making up stories to receive a lighter sentence. In an excerpt from the Fox & Friends interview, which will be aired in full on Thursday,Mr Trump responded to questions about the hush payments,externalby insisting that they were ""not a campaign violation"". ""They came from me,"" he said. ""And I tweeted about it. But they did not come out of the campaign."" He added that he had only found out about the payments ""later on"". His comments contradict a statement made earlier by Cohen under oath in which he said the president had instructed him to make the payments. In July,Cohen released audio tapes of him and Mr Trump allegedly discussing one of the paymentsbefore the election. Cohen, who was Mr Trump's personal lawyer for more than a decade, admitted passing on funds to two women thought to be porn star Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal. The hush money payments were not reported to the Federal Election Commission during the campaign. The question is whether the payments were made to protect Mr Trump's personal reputation or to protect his image as a presidential candidate. Under US election rules, any payments made with the aim of influencing a vote must be reported. Why Trump's opponents are holding off on impeachment Trumpland's crazy Tuesday, blow by blow Trump's chances of weathering the storm Cohen acknowledged in court that the aim was indeed to protect Mr Trump's candidacy, saying he had paid the money ""at the direction"" of Mr Trump ""for the principal purpose of influencing the election"". If Mr Trump were to be prosecuted over the money - not through the normal courts, because he is the sitting president, but conceivably in Congress, through an impeachment process - investigators would have to prove that he had indeed given the money to Cohen for electoral reasons. In his first public comments, back in April, about his alleged affair with Stormy Daniels, Mr Trump denied knowing about the $130,000 (Â£100,000) payment made to the actress via Cohen. Ms Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, alleges that she and Mr Trump had sex in a hotel room in 2006. Asked by a reporter in the press cabin of Air Force One if he had any knowledge about where Cohen had got the money to pay Ms Daniels, the president responded at the time: ""I don't know."" The following month, Mr Trump officially disclosed a payment to Cohen of between $100,001 and $250,000 for expenses incurred in 2016. Any action against Mr Trump is unlikely until after the mid-term elections on 6 November, when the opposition Democrats will seek to break the grip of Mr Trump's Republican Party on Congress. In the meantime, Cohen may agree to testify to the inquiry into alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. There is no confirmation that Cohen will speak to Robert Mueller's inquiry buthis personal lawyer has said his client is happy to talk.

"Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said he hoped the no-deal preparations would be ""rendered redundant"" by an agreement with the EU Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab has set out what he called ""practical and proportionate"" advice in case the UK leaves the EU without a deal. The guidance includes instructions for businesses who could face extra paperwork at borders and contingency plans to avoid medicine shortages. Britons visiting the EU could also face extra credit card charges. Ministers say a deal is the most likely outcome but that ""short-term disruption"" is possible without one. BBC political correspondent Chris Mason described the publication as a ""vast swirling porridge of detail - much of it at a technical level, advising individual industries about the manner in which they are regulated in the event of a no-deal Brexit"". Labour said a no-deal outcome would be ""catastrophic"" and a ""complete failure by the government to negotiate for Britain"". Just after the documents were released, Chancellor Philip Hammond reiterated awarning,externalfrom his department of a 7.7% hit to GDP over the next 15 years under a no-deal Brexit scenario,in a letter to the Treasury Committee.,external The timing of that release angered pro-Brexit MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, who said the Treasury was trying to stop Brexit, and that it consistently painted a bleak picture ""because they are frightened of taking responsibility for managing the economy without the crutch of the EU"". In the 24documents,external, which cover industries including medicine, finance and farming, it says: The cost of card payments between the UK and EU will ""likely increase"" and won't be covered by a ban on surcharges Businesses trading with the EU should start planning for new customs checks, and might have to pay for new software or logistical help Britons living elsewhere in Europe could lose access to UK banking and pension services without EU action UK organic food producers could face new hurdles to exporting to the EU Pharmaceutical companies have been told to stockpile an extra six weeks' worth of medicine to ensure a ""seamless"" supply The UK would continue to accept new medicines that have been tested in the EU Low-value parcels from the EU would no longer be eligible for VAT relief New picture warnings will be needed for cigarette packets as the EU owns the copyright to the current ones Mr Raab said reaching a deal with the EU was the ""overriding priority"" and ""by far the most likely outcome"" but that ""we must be ready to consider the alternative"". He also dismissed what he said were ""wilder claims"" about the impact of not reaching a deal, including that it could spark a ""sandwich famine"" in the UK. ""Let me assure you that, contrary to one of the wilder claims, you will still be able to enjoy a BLT after Brexit, and there are no plans to deploy the Army to maintain food supplies,"" he said. What do the Brexit 'no deal' papers reveal? Reality Check: What would 'no deal' look like? Brexit: The key dates ahead No-deal Brexit: A costly prospect for many consumers and firms The UK will cease to be a member of the EU on 29 March 2019. With several sticking points remaining in negotiations, there has increasingly been talk of what happens if there is no agreement in place, includingpolice chiefswarning of a risk to the public if the UK loses access to EU-wide crime databases and Bank of England governor Mark Carney saying no deal would be ""highly undesirable"". Pro-Brexit campaigners have described the warnings as ""Project Fear"" - saying the UK has nothing to fear from leaving without a trade deal and falling back onWorld Trade Organization rules. Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg told the Today programme on BBC Radio 4 that such an arrangement ""would suffice"" and said the risks had been ""absurdly overstated"". His fellow Brexiteer John Redwood said stockpiling six weeks worth of medical supplies was ""a bit over the top"" but that the government was being ""ultra cautious"". Please upgrade your browser Analysis by BBC deputy political editor John Pienaar This didn't seem a comfortable moment for Dominic Raab. The Brexit secretary campaigned for Leave, and is a true believer in the cause. Yet here he was, setting out plans to cope with a British failure to reach the kind of deal Brexiteers once claimed would be easy to accomplish. Again and again, the Brexit department's guidance refers to the ""unlikely event"" of Brexit without an EU deal - but Dominic Raab conceded it could happen. The risk was real. The International Trade Secretary, Liam Fox, has suggested that outcome is more likely than not. The Brexit secretary may disagree on the level of risk, but could not deny that it would lead to higher costs and a fresh burden of red tape on businesses, scientific and medical research and individuals. Read John's blog on the no-deal papers The European Commission said Brexit would lead to disruption ""with a deal or without a deal"". ""That's why everybody, and in particular economic operators, need to be prepared,"" it said. Thecommission has already published,externalits own assessment of no deal, saying there would be ""no specific arrangement"" for EU citizens living in the UK or for UK citizens in the EU and warning of ""significant delays"" at borders. For Labour, shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer said Mr Raab's speech was ""thin on detail, thin on substance and provided no answers to how ministers intend to mitigate the serious consequences of leaving the EU without an agreement"". ""A no-deal Brexit has never been viable and would represent a complete failure of the government's negotiating strategy,"" he said. Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones said a no-deal Brexit would cause ""huge disruption and serious, long-lasting economic and social damage"", and Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable added: ""This isn't project fear by critics of Brexit, this is the government itself and independent bodies pointing to the damage that will be caused."" The National Farmers' Union warned of a ""disastrous"" cliff edge scenario for the UK food supply chain. Business group the CBI said: ""These papers show that those who claim crashing out of the EU on World Trade Organisation rules is acceptable live in a world of fantasy, where facts are not allowed to challenge ideology."" Pointing to the possibility of new credit card charges, Lord Adonis of the People's Vote campaign, said: ""Every time a new Brexit paper is published, more people are made worse off"". TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said the reports confirmed no-deal Brexit was not a credible option, as it would be ""devastating for working people"".

"Catherine Sezen of the Association of Colleges and Tom Laws of the National Careers Service answer your questions For anyone whose GCSE grades are a disappointment or a puzzle, we have experts on hand, ready to give advice. Whether you want to do A-levels, a more technically focused course at college or take an apprenticeship, good advice is a must. Tom Laws, a careers adviser with the National Careers Service, and Catherine Sezen, a senior curriculum expert at the Association of Colleges, are offering personalised advice on what to do if your grades are different to what you were expecting. GCSE results rise despite tougher exams How do the new 9-1 grades work? In English GCSE, my son achieved a 3 in literature and a 5 in language. Is this a pass? He needs a good pass in English to get his apprenticeship. So we are quite anxious. Mat A 5 is a strong pass in the new grading and a 3 is roughly equivalent to an old-style D. I would think that the 5 will be enough for him to get on to his apprenticeship, but it is always a good idea to check with the college or employer in case they have a different requirement. He has done well to get a 5 in English language. I hope he goes on to enjoy his apprenticeship. Catherine Well done to your son for his English Language grade! With an apprenticeship, the employer and training providers have final say with regards to what grades they are willing to accept, but you will find that many apprentices who may not have the GCSE pass grades needed are able to study for these alongside the apprenticeship course which mean they don't have to put their plans on hold to resit the GCSE course. I would recommend speaking directly with the employer and apprenticeship training provider to find out exactly what grades they will accept. If it turns out he will need to resit, I would recommend calling the Exam Results Helpline on 0800 100 900 to speak with one of our expert advisers about the available options. Tom My daughter needed a grade 5 in maths which seems a standard requirement for sixth form and only got a 4. Is it likely they will still accept her given that she won't be doing maths in future? Tim A grade 4 is equivalent to a low grade C, but many school sixth forms and colleges may require students going on to A-levels to have achieved a grade 5 or above. Schools and colleges set their own entry requirements. I would suggest that you contact the school or college and ask them what opportunities there are for your daughter with the maths grade she has and her other exam grades. Your local college will have options available if the sixth form is not able to offer her a place. Catherine It is completely up to the sixth form as to what grade boundaries they will accept but each sixth form can be flexible and it is certainly worth speaking with them directly to find out exactly what options are available to your daughter. Many sixth forms do accept students whose grades have perhaps not quite met the initial requirements, but if you need any advice about alternative options which could be available, you are more than welcome to get in touch with the Exam Results Helpline to discuss this in more detail. Tom My son is receiving his results and I would like to know whether there is an alternative route to get a degree without doing A-levels. Can you advise? Dipesh Hi Dipesh, Academic qualifications like A-levels are only one route to a degree and a career. Your son could also take a technical or vocational qualification, which could lead either to a degree or an apprenticeship or a higher level technical qualification. Your local further education college will be able to advise on the opportunities available which be best suited to your son's future plans. Catherine Many students are looking into the idea of apprenticeships as a real alternative to university. Apprenticeship are available at degree level in a wide variety of subjects and allow an apprenticeship to gain work experience within their preferred industry alongside their training, with the added benefit of gaining a wage for the work they do! For more information, check outthe apprenticeships information on the gov.uk website,externalor give the Exam Results Helpline a call on 0800 100 900 to talk about apprenticeship options in more detail! Tom My daughter has just collected her results. She got 7s, 6s and a 5. To translate these to myself, family and friends I have calculated that the 7s equal an A, the 6s a high B and the 5 a low B or high C. Is that right? Sharon Congratulations to your daughter, those are some brilliant results! You're pretty much spot on with your translations. It can be a little confusing at first but I agree with your conclusions.Look at this link for more detail. Tom Hi Sharon, these are very good grades. I am sure your daughter is celebrating. You are quite right with your translation from old to new. Your daughter has done really well. Catherine Why did they change the grades from letters to numbers? Dojj GCSEs have been reformed. For example, they are no longer modular and all exams are taken at the end of year 11. As a part of this reform process the grading system was changed. There are more grades now, nine rather than the previous eight. The aim is that the new grading structure will allow greater differentiation between students at the higher levels and will help distinguish these new GCSEs from the A*- G versions. Catherine In the older system, there were four grade boundaries available above a pass grade (A*, A, B and C) while the numbered system splits these same grades into six different grades (4 through to 9). This can make it easier for colleges, universities, apprenticeship providers and employers to see where a student sits on the grading scale. Tom This video can not be played Our next chapter: GCSE results and beyond My question is will GCSE results influence whether someone can secure a place at a top university? If so, how significant is this influence? What are the key things students should focus on if they have scored a few grade 6s and want to get into top universities? Rentala Top universities will take a student's GCSE grades into account as the competition for places at these universities can be very high. This means the universities can be more selective when they offer places to prospective students. If anyone feels their GCSE grades are not as high as they could be and is worried about how this could affect their university applications, there are a number of other things which universities look for in addition to grades. Universities like to see applicants who have well-rounded experiences - this doesn't only mean academic ability but also includes real-world experience and examples of how they have used their skills outside of an educational setting. This can include taking part in independent projects or volunteering activities. You can contactthe National Careers Service,externalfor more information about how to find these opportunities. Tom Places at some universities and in some subjects can be very competitive. Universities may well look at GCSE grades as part of their decision-making process. They will also read through personal statements and in some cases ask students in for interview. The 16 to 18 phase sees many young people develop and change their plans as their outlook and experience grows. I would recommend working to the best of your ability and thinking carefully about next steps. Taking the opportunity to visit different universities and find out whether the course and environment is right for them can be helpful. Grade 6 indicates a good level of achievement and will help support progression into higher education and future employment.

"Some reports say the man threatened to kill police A man killed his mother and sister and wounded a third person on a street in a Paris suburb before being killed by police. French Interior Minister GÃ©rard Collomb said the incident was not currently being treated as a terror attack. The Islamic State group claimed it was behind the attack but offered no proof. Some reports say the man threatened to kill police and shouted ""Allahu Akbar"" (""God is greatest"" in Arabic) before he was shot. The man ran into a house after attacking his victims before coming out with a knife in his hand, at which point he was shot by police. Speaking in the south-western suburb of Trappes where the incident took place, Mr Collomb said the attacker appeared to have had ""significant psychiatric problems"". He said the man had been known to police for expressing extremist views, but was ""unstable"" and ""not someone who could respond to instructions from a terrorist group"". France has been on constant alert for jihadist terrorist attacks since the Paris attacks of 2015. Trappes, close to Versailles, is known for gang violence and poverty. It also has Islamists among its large Muslim population, with 50 local people suspected of having left France to fight for the Islamic State group in Syria and Iraq, according to security sources quoted by AFP.

"A yoga ball was found in the boot of a locked car in which Mr Khaw's wife and daughter were found dead An anaesthetist killed his wife and 16-year-old daughter using a yoga ball filled with carbon monoxide, a Hong Kong court has heard. Prosecutors said Khaw Kim-sun left the inflatable ball in the boot of a car where the gas leaked out and killed them. The pair were found dead inside a locked car in 2015, in a case that initially baffled police. Mr Khaw has pleaded not guilty to two counts of murder. A post-mortem examination showed his wife and eldest daughter had died from carbon monoxide poisoning. Police found a deflated yoga ball in the back of the yellow Mini Cooper in which their bodies were discovered. Prosecutors told Hong Kong's High Court that Mr Khaw had deliberately plotted to kill his wife because he was having an affair and she would not grant him a divorce, the South China Morning Post said. But they said it was unlikely he wanted to kill his daughter. He allegedly told his younger daughter to stay at home to complete homework. Colorado dad charged with killing family How this photo solved a fatal hit-and-run Iowa suspect 'forgot dead jogger in car' Eyewitnesses said they saw Mr Khaw, an associate professor at Hong Kong's Chinese University, filling two balls with carbon monoxide, reports said. He told colleagues he was going to kill rabbits with the gas, but reports say he contradicted himself by telling police he wanted to use it to get rid of rats at his home. The trial continues.

"This video can not be played The fish and chip shop in North Yorkshire has become a hit with visitors from China A fish and chip shop in North Yorkshire has translated its menu for Mandarin and Cantonese speakers to cope with an influx of Chinese tourists. Scotts Fish and Chips near York has seen coachloads of visitors wanting to try the traditional dish. The passion for the chippy has been put down to the fish and chips Chinese president Xi Jinping shared with then Prime Minister David Cameron in 2015. Manager Roxy Vasai said more than 100 Chinese tourists were visiting a week. The restaurant on the A64 is about six miles from York Staff said dining at the chippy was a real occasion for the visitors, with many taking photographs with employees both inside and outside the restaurant on the A64 at Bilbrough Top. The restaurant's location is also thought to be one of the reasons for the influx because it is on the main route for tour groups visiting York from London. Yorkshire breaking news: 'Urgent' appeal over missing woman; Wayward wallaby 'could be 100 miles away' Ms Vasai said: ""We look out for a coach and when they're coming we shout 'they're here, there are 20, 30, 40, let's make it ready for them'. ""We are very impressed by the Chinese tourists. They are very friendly, smiley and happy."" As well as translating the menu, Scotts has launched a website and a messaging app on one of China's most popular social media platforms to promote the business. Will Zhuang, ambassador for Make It York, an organisation which promotes the city, said many Chinese visitors had been influenced by their president sampling afish and chip supper during his visit to the UK in 2015. He added that because of this many Chinese tour operators had added the ""fish and chip experience"" to their itineraries. He said: ""Most of the Chinese tour groups will visit London, Cambridge and then to York and on their way to York they will pass the A64, so this is an ideal location for the coach to park up."" York is already a popular destination for tourists from East Asia, with China estimated to be the city's second largest overseas market.

"The way it used to be? A nuclear-powered ice-breaker escorts tankers in the Russian Arctic A Danish vessel setting sail from Vladivostok this week is set to become the first container ship to tackle the Arctic sea route north of Russia. The Venta Maersk, owned by Maersk Line, and carrying 3,600 containers, hopes to reach St Petersburg by late September. That could be up to 14 days faster than the southern route via the Suez Canal. Maersk will collect data on the Northern Sea Route to see if the melting of Arctic sea ice has made the passage economically viable. Maersk said: ""The trial passage will enable us to explore the operational feasibility of container shipping through the Northern Sea Route and to collect data."" The Venta Maersk, designed as a new ""ice-class"" container ship, will carry frozen fish and other refrigerated and general cargo. The route stretches from the Bering Strait in the east between Russia and Alaska to Norway in the west. However, Maersk added: ""Currently, we do not see the Northern Sea Route as a commercial alternative to our existing network, which is defined by our customers' demand, trading patterns and population centres."" Until now the the route has required an escort of expensive nuclear icebreakers to accompany any vessel. But global warming, which has raised temperatures along the route during the summer to over 30C, is changing its viability. A report fromthe Copenhagen Business School in 2016,externalfound that shipping through the Northern Sea Route would become economically feasible in about 2040 if the ice cover continued to diminish at its present rate. The Christophe de Margerie moored in St Petersburg It may happen even earlier. The Christophe de Margerie, a 984ft liquefied natural gas tanker built specifically for the journey, becamethe first ship to sail the route unaided,externallast year, while the Russian gas company Novatek has used the route for specially built tankers this year. China is also using the Northern Sea Route as part of its One Belt, One Road initiative to build trade routes across Eurasia. Its state-owned Cosco shipping company sent a multi-purpose cargo ship, the Lian Hua Song, into a Russian port last autumn for the first time via the route, delivering equipment for the construction of a subway and a fertiliser plant.

"This video can not be played Sylvia Marsh was left waiting for an ambulance after falling and breaking her hip A patient waited 62 hours for an ambulance, while four trusts took more than 24 hours to respond to 999 calls, new figures have shown. The longest delays in the UK were recorded by Welsh Ambulance Service, which kept four patients waiting for more than 50 hours. A spokesman said the figures were ""not typical"" and ""represent the extreme end of the waiting time spectrum"". The Patients Association said they were ""extremely concerning"". Between June 2017 and June 2018, ambulances from four services took 24 hours to reach patients, including some with breathing and mental health problems. The trusts said the longest waits were for ""less serious calls"", and they had to prioritise responding to people in life-threatening or urgent conditions. Most ambulance services also reported achieving the national target of responding to the most serious type of call in an average of eight minutes or less. Lucy Watson, from the Patients Association, said: ""Everybody should be getting the services that they need. ""We know that demand has gone up on all health services as our population is getting older, and we need to see the level of investment increasing so our ambulances can respond in a timely way."" Caroline Hardaker was told the service was ""exceptionally busy"" when she called Caroline Hardaker's mother Sylvia, 79, lay on paving stones in her back garden for three-and-a-half hours after falling and breaking her hip in High Wycombe. She said: ""I think I rang six times in the end, and each time they said they would have a clinician call back and then they didn't. ""It was so frustrating, just thinking 'how long are they going to take'? And my mum was going into shock, her arms were shaking. Her arm had gone numb. ""She was obviously cold because she was lying on a pavement. ""The ambulance and hospital staff have been fantastic - its not their fault, the whole system is breaking down. ""When I was a child you were told it would be a maximum of eight minutes for an ambulance, but three-and-a-half hours is completely unacceptable."" Paul Jefferies, from South Central Ambulance Service, which covers High Wycombe, said if patients experienced delays it was because ""higher categories of calls took priority"". Stephen Clinton, assistant director of operations for Welsh Ambulance Service, said: ""We fully accept that a number of patients waited far longer than anyone would like. ""That said, these figures represent the extreme end of the waiting time spectrum and are neither typical nor do they explain the circumstances of these individual cases."" He said in some of the cases the patients were already in the care of medical teams, and others were affected by extreme weather conditions. The service did not provide details of the four patients who waited more than 50 hours. But the longest three calls were in the second-most serious ""amber"" category, classified as ""patients who may need treatment at scene or taking quickly to health facility"". The remaining call was rated ""green"", a classification used for ""less urgent calls"". The trusts said majority of ambulances reached people within their eight-minute targets The new figures, obtained by the BBC after a Freedom of Information request, also show that between 2015 and 2017, the total number of calls received increased by 15%. In 2015, UK ambulance services received 8,892,346 calls, which rose to 9,891,559 in 2016 and 10,242,507 in 2017. An Association of Ambulance Chief Executives spokesman said resources had been stretched by ""an exceptionally long and busy winter"". An NHS Improvement spokesman said it had recently introduced an ambulance response programme to help services cope with the increasing demand. He added: ""An additional Â£36 million of funding recently announced will boost paramedic crews and improve the quality of NHS ambulance fleets.""

"A private school says it's seeking legal advice after getting complaints about a ""highly inappropriate"" music video filmed on its grounds. Stefflon Don used Mill Hill School to film the video for her new song Pretty Girl. One scene depicts the rapper smoking cannabis in her dorm, and she can also be seen swearing at another student. The school has apologised and says it is ""investigating"" how the video was allowed to be made. Mill Hill School is an independent school in North London. In the video for Pretty Girl, Mobo winner Stefflon Don plays a new girl entering a pretty unwelcoming environment. After struggling to make friends, the 26-year-old gets into a very sweary argument with another student during a row on the football pitch and appears naked in a shower scene. Finally she appears to make some friends when she depicts getting high in her dorm room with some other girls. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

"Some reports say the man threatened to kill police A man killed his mother and sister and wounded a third person on a street in a Paris suburb before being killed by police. French Interior Minister GÃ©rard Collomb said the incident was not currently being treated as a terror attack. The Islamic State group claimed it was behind the attack but offered no proof. Some reports say the man threatened to kill police and shouted ""Allahu Akbar"" (""God is greatest"" in Arabic) before he was shot. The man ran into a house after attacking his victims before coming out with a knife in his hand, at which point he was shot by police. Speaking in the south-western suburb of Trappes where the incident took place, Mr Collomb said the attacker appeared to have had ""significant psychiatric problems"". He said the man had been known to police for expressing extremist views, but was ""unstable"" and ""not someone who could respond to instructions from a terrorist group"".

"Ryanair and pilots' union FÃ³rsa have reached an agreement, the trade union has said. It comes after a 22-hour session which began on Wednesday morning and ended at 07:30 BST on Thursday. The proposed agreement will now be balloted by members with the union recommending that it is accepted. FÃ³rsa say they have been asked by talks facilitator Kieran Mulvey not to make any further comment while the ballot takes place. Third day of pilot strikes at Ryanair Ryanair threatened by fresh strikes It is understood that Ryanair is expected to remove the threat of job losses if the deal with pilots is ratified. Last month, the airline issued 90-day protective notices to 100 pilots and 200 cabin crew based at Dublin airport, partly blaming the effect of strikes. It said it would cut the Dublin fleet by six planes and move them to Poland. However, as part of the agreement reached overnight, it is understood the airline's negotiators will recommend to the board that the protective notices are removed if the deal is passed. That ballot by the pilots involved is expected to take place in two weeks' time. It is also understood that the deal includes an overall agreement and a specific piece on base transfers and command upgrades, a key issue in the dispute. This the first collective agreement the airline has reached in Ireland, since it agreed to recognise unions last year. The dispute between the airline and some of its Irish pilots centred around base transfers, promotions, annual leave and other issues. It has resulted in five days of strike action by about 100 of Ryanair's 350 Irish-based pilots. Many Ryanair staff have been on strike across Europe. Earlier this month, there was a 24-hour walk-out involving staff in Germany, Sweden, Ireland, Belgium and the Netherlands. About 50,000 passengers were understood to be involved in the cancellation of 400 flights. Ryanair has cancelled 600 flights that were due to fly this week but says the majority of European customers are not affected. In July, 300 Ryanair flights were cancelled when cabin crews in Belgium, Portugal and Spain went on strike for 48 hours.

"US President Donald Trump's trade war against China has moved up a gear as it brings in a 25% tax on a second wave of goods worth $16bn (Â£12.4bn). The move ratchets up the dispute, which had already seen trade tariffs being imposed earlier this year. There are fears that more tariffs could cause further damage to companies and consumers. Goods affected this timeinclude motorcycles and aerials.,external China immediately imposed retaliatory taxes on the same value of US products. President Trump has been sounding off about unfair trade since even before he became president. During the 2016 election campaign, he said China engaged in the ""rape"" of the American economy. He ordered an investigation into Chinese trade policies in August 2017 and has been steadily imposing tariffs on Chinese goods since January this year. Bikes, cots and fridges: the imports hit by Trump's tariffs US-China trade row: What has happened so far? The early victims of Trump's trade war Six ways China could retaliate in a trade war His administration says the tariffs are intended to counter Chinese practices, such as state subsidies, that make it difficult for US companies to compete against their Chinese rivals. President Trump thinks that by slapping on an extra tax - or tariff - he will make life easier for US companies, whose goods will become cheaper within the US by comparison. The measures are part of the president's broader ""America First"" approach, which has also prompted the US to impose higher import duties on steel and aluminium, including from Mexico, Canada and the European Union. All of those countries have retaliated. President Trump has taken an aggressive stance on trade with China The tariffs that went into effect on Thursday apply to a vast range of goods in 279 product categories, including semiconductors, plastics, chemicals and railway equipment, and fridges. China's list of 333 US product categories includes coal, copper scrap, fuel, buses and medical equipment. Previous items affected included steel, soya beans, fruit, wine, whiskey, and pig products. The US has threatened a third round oftariffs on an additional $200bn of Chinese goods, which includemany more consumer productsthan the previous lists. These could come as soon as next month. It has since said those items - which include bikes, baby cots and animal medicine - could be hit with a 25% levy - more than double the 10% originally planned. China has said it would respond with another tariff on $60bn of US goods. Although Mr Trump states his moves will protect US industry and business, dozens of US companies and industry groups have testified to the US Trade Representative's Office that their businesses are being harmed. Many firms are worried that Chinese retaliatory tariffs will make their products more expensive and reduce demand. For businesses that rely on Chinese imports, US tariffs also threaten to raise costs, leading to higher prices for US customers. There are even warnings that the tariff on children's cots - threatened in the next round - could be harmful to health. ""Increasing tariffs on juvenile bedding products would directly promote an increased risk to child safety,"" claimsSam Shamie, of the Delta Enterprise Corporation,external. Kenneth O'Brien of Gemini Shippers Group,externalis particularly vocal in his opposition to tariffs on Chinese imports, which he says ""will lead to the destruction of American jobs and the potential bankruptcy of US small businesses"". Some businesses welcome the move, though. The Southern Shrimp Alliance is glad not to have to compete with Chinese shrimp products. It also says these are a health risk to the American public, so there's an additional benefit to the tariffs here. This video can not be played ""We have to be prepared for the worst"" China blames the US and has accused it of ""unilaterally"" heightening tensions between the two economic giants. It will be difficult for Beijing to match the US threats because its manufacturers export far more products than American businesses send to China. The range of goods available for China to put retaliatory taxes on is therefore shorter. But there are other ways that China can respond. Iris Pang, Greater China economist at ING Wholesale Banking in Hong Kong, says it could make life harder for the US to do business in China, by increasing the cost and amount of red tape. As the BBC's Asia business correspondent, Karishma Vaswani, points out, what hurts Beijing can also hurt countries further afield. Many goods that are needed for final assembly in China actually come from other South East Asian countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia, and go through Singapore to have some other products added on. The International Monetary Fund said last monthan escalation of the tit-for-tat tariffs could shave 0.5% off global growth by 2020. Economists say that means some countries in the Asia-Pacific region could see as much as a percentage point shaved off economic growth. Ultimately, all exports from China to the US could face tariffs. The president said in July thathe was ready to taxall of the $500bn worth of Chinese imports into the US. China has retaliated in kind to both hostilities from the US and there's no reason to think it would not respond in the same ""toe-to-toe"" fashion. Officials from the US and China are currently holding low-level talks in Washington, but hopes are not high that they will bring the dispute to an end. Meantime, China plans to file a fresh complaint against the tariffs at the World Trade Organization (WTO), which adjudicates in global trade disputes. China's commerce ministry says it ""clearly suspected"" the US of violating WTO rules. It filed an initial complaint at the WTO in July as Mr Trump imposed his first round of tariffs. 8 goods to be hit by Trump's tariffs US-China trade row: What has happened so far?

"Thousands of teenagers across England, Wales and Northern Ireland are receiving their GCSE results. But, in England, there have been major changes, with a new 9-1 grading system being phased in to reflect a more demanding curriculum. So what's the new grading system all about? The new grading scheme is being brought in alongside a new GCSE curriculum in England. 9 is the highest grade, while 1 is the lowest, not including a U (ungraded). Three number grades, 9, 8 and 7, correspond to the old-style top grades of A* and A - this is designed to give more differentiation at the top end. The exams watchdog, Ofqual, says fewer grade 9s will be awarded than A*s and that anyone who gets a 9 will have ""performed exceptionally"". A 4 is broadly being compared to a C grade, although Ofqual warns against ""direct comparisons and overly simplistic descriptions"". It says that, broadly, the same proportion of teenagers will get a grade four and above as used to get a grade C or above. It's confusing, but there are two pass marks - 4 is a standard pass and 5 is a strong pass. This means that a candidate who gets nine 4 grades has, technically, passed all their exams. 'Geography was hardest exam ever' However, with the government'sschool league tables,externaldetailing what percentage of pupils achieved a grade 5 or above in English and maths and in theEnglish Baccelaureate,externalsubjects, it's hard to imagine that teachers will be content to see their pupils settle for a 4 as a pass. The reality is that schools will be pushing pupils for at least a 5 and most sixth forms will be looking for students with strong passes. Yes they are. Last summer, students sat the new exams in just English language, English literature and maths. This year's Year 11 students sat the 9-1 exams in: ancient languages (classical Greek, Latin) art and design biology chemistry citizenship studies combined science (double award) computer science dance drama food preparation and nutrition geography history modern foreign languages (French, German, Spanish) music physics physical education religious studies Next summer, 2019, will see a third wave of 9-1 exams in: ancient history astronomy business classical civilisation design and technology economics electronics engineering film studies geology media studies modern foreign languages (Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, Italian, Japanese, modern Greek, modern Hebrew, Panjabi, Polish, Russian, Urdu) psychology sociology statistics The final wave of 9-1 GCSEs will be taught from this autumn, with exams in 2020, covering: ancient languages (biblical Hebrew) modern foreign languages (Gujarati, Persian, Portuguese, Turkish) Yes, that's right. Last year's Year 11s got their English and maths results under the new numerical grading scheme, and the rest of their options were graded A*-G. This year's cohort are sitting most of their GCSEs under the new system, but they will get some results under the old system, for example if they are taking ancient history or ICT. Yes, there are changes to the way in which grades for combined science are being allocated. This qualification is worth two grades. Under the old system, candidates would be given a combined score that was effectively a single grade doubled up - so A*/A*, A/A, B/B and so on. The new system allows for a little more differentiation, so that students will be given two equal grades (for example 5/5) or adjacent grades (for example 5/4). In total, there are 17 possible grade combinations from 9/9 to 1/1. The new GCSE grading scheme is part of a new curriculum introduced in England's schools in 2014 by the then Education Secretary, Michael Gove. The new GCSE courses include much less coursework than before, with grades in almost all subjects depending on exams. Courses are designed to be more challenging with exams taken after two years of study, rather than in modules with exams along the way. Change has been under way in Wales as well. The Welsh government introduced new and revised GCSEs, which have been taught in schools from September 2015. The most significant changes are in English language, Welsh language and mathematics. But, one crucial difference to England is that the letter-based grading structure  A*- G is being maintained. While pupils in England will have results graded 9-1 and pupils in Wales will have A*-G graded results, pupils in Northern Ireland will end up with a mix of A*-G and numerical grades. Approximately three-quarters of GCSEs in Northern Ireland are taken through the NI Council for Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment (CCEA) and the remaining quarter through the English- and Welsh-based exam boards AQA, OCR, Edexcel or WJEC. Scotland has its own system of public examinations: Nationals and Highers. Nationals replaced the old Standard Gradesin 2014. Andnew Higher examswere introduced in 2015.

"US President Donald Trump's trade war against China has moved up a gear as it brings in a 25% tax on a second wave of goods worth $16bn (Â£12.4bn). The move ratchets up the dispute, which had already seen trade tariffs being imposed earlier this year. There are fears that more tariffs could cause further damage to companies and consumers. Goods affected this timeinclude motorcycles and aerials.,external China immediately imposed retaliatory taxes on the same value of US products. President Trump has been sounding off about unfair trade since even before he became president. During the 2016 election campaign, he said China engaged in the ""rape"" of the American economy. He ordered an investigation into Chinese trade policies in August 2017 and has been steadily imposing tariffs on Chinese goods since January this year. Bikes, cots and fridges: the imports hit by Trump's tariffs US-China trade row: What has happened so far? The early victims of Trump's trade war Six ways China could retaliate in a trade war His administration says the tariffs are intended to counter Chinese practices, such as state subsidies, that make it difficult for US companies to compete against their Chinese rivals. President Trump thinks that by slapping on an extra tax - or tariff - he will make life easier for US companies, whose goods will become cheaper within the US by comparison. The measures are part of the president's broader ""America First"" approach, which has also prompted the US to impose higher import duties on steel and aluminium, including from Mexico, Canada and the European Union. All of those countries have retaliated. President Trump has taken an aggressive stance on trade with China The tariffs that went into effect on Thursday apply to a vast range of goods in 279 product categories, including semiconductors, plastics, chemicals and railway equipment, and fridges. China's list of 333 US product categories includes coal, copper scrap, fuel, buses and medical equipment. Previous items affected included steel, soya beans, fruit, wine, whiskey, and pig products. The US has threatened a third round oftariffs on an additional $200bn of Chinese goods, which includemany more consumer productsthan the previous lists. These could come as soon as next month. It has since said those items - which include bikes, baby cots and animal medicine - could be hit with a 25% levy - more than double the 10% originally planned. China has said it would respond with another tariff on $60bn of US goods. Although Mr Trump states his moves will protect US industry and business, dozens of US companies and industry groups have testified to the US Trade Representative's Office that their businesses are being harmed. Many firms are worried that Chinese retaliatory tariffs will make their products more expensive and reduce demand. For businesses that rely on Chinese imports, US tariffs also threaten to raise costs, leading to higher prices for US customers. There are even warnings that the tariff on children's cots - threatened in the next round - could be harmful to health. ""Increasing tariffs on juvenile bedding products would directly promote an increased risk to child safety,"" claimsSam Shamie, of the Delta Enterprise Corporation,external. Kenneth O'Brien of Gemini Shippers Group,externalis particularly vocal in his opposition to tariffs on Chinese imports, which he says ""will lead to the destruction of American jobs and the potential bankruptcy of US small businesses"".

"Friday afternoon and evening will see some of the heaviest congestion of the bank holiday weekend Drivers are being warned to expect delays of up to an hour on motorways on Friday ahead of the August bank holiday. Most roadworks on motorways and major roads in England will be lifted but about 40 sets will remain for safety reasons. Experts predict roads will become congested from 14:00 BST on Friday as holidaymakers mix with commuters. Rail engineering work means there will be no trains to and from London Euston. Most direct Virgin Trains services between the capital and the north-west of England have been cancelled with remaining services terminating at Milton Keynes. Journeys on the M5 between junctions four (Bromsgrove) and one (West Bromwich) from 09:30 to 14:00 on Friday could take four times longer than usual to travel, about one hour and 21 minutes instead of the average 21 minutes. The M20 in Kent, junctions nine to three, could take more than an hour for a journey normally lasting 22 minutes. The peak time is expected to be 07:30 to 09:30 and affects drivers heading towards the Channel Tunnel and Port of Dover. On Saturday, journey times on the M1 between Leicester and Nottingham are expected to rise from a normal 16 minutes to just over an hour, particularly between 14:30 and 17:00. The stretch includes eight miles of roadworks that are not being lifted. In Newport, Wales, drivers on the M4 between junctions 29 and 24 could take half an hour to cover a journey that normally lasts about 13 minutes. The peak time on Friday is 10:30 to 17:30. In Northern Ireland on Saturday, the 6.4 mile stretch of the A6 from Eden River to Dungiven may take 35 minutes instead of the usual 10. And in Scotland, where there is no bank holiday this weekend, drivers are warned the M8 A725 in Belshill to the A779 at Bathgate might take about 39 minutes instead of a normal 25 on Sunday. The predictions by the RAC and transport analysts Inrix are based on data for previous bank holidays, planned construction and road closures, events and weather forecasts. RAC spokesman Rod Dennis said drivers should also expect the Almondsbury interchange at Bristol, where the M5 and M4 meet, to be busy. ""As tens of thousands of drivers head for Devon and Cornwall the coming-together of traffic leads to regular tailbacks every Friday afternoon,"" he said. ""Add a bank holiday and some sunshine into the mix and it's the perfect recipe for a long wait on the motorway."" 300 miles of roadworks will be lifted or finished by 06:00 on Friday Highways England said it would lift or finish roadworks on motorways and major roads by 06:00 on Friday. It said 97% of the network would be clear but has left about 40 sets in place for safety reasons. About 150,000 people usually use London Euston at a weekend Trains will be disrupted by 400 sets of engineering work taking place over the weekend. It means: No trains to or from London Euston from Saturday to Monday or the following weekend, 1-2 September. No trains at Bolton from Saturday until Friday 31 August and replacement buses running between Manchester, Preston, Wigan and Blackburn Replacement buses between Coventry, Leamington Spa and Birmingham International, affecting Birmingham Airport passengers, from Saturday until 12:00 on Monday Replacement buses between Crewe and Liverpool South Parkway from Saturday to Monday Peter Broadley, Virgin Trains executive director, said: ""With no services into or out of Euston we strongly advise our customers to avoid travelling to London on the days affected.""

"Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said he hoped the no-deal preparations would be ""rendered redundant"" by an agreement with the EU Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab has set out what he called ""practical and proportionate"" advice in case the UK leaves the EU without a deal. The guidance includes instructions for businesses who could face extra paperwork at borders and contingency plans to avoid medicine shortages. Britons visiting the EU could also face extra credit card charges. Ministers say a deal is the most likely outcome but that ""short-term disruption"" is possible without one. BBC political correspondent Chris Mason described the publication as a ""vast swirling porridge of detail - much of it at a technical level, advising individual industries about the manner in which they are regulated in the event of a no-deal Brexit"". Labour said a no-deal outcome would be ""catastrophic"" and a ""complete failure by the government to negotiate for Britain"". Just after the documents were released, Chancellor Philip Hammond reiterated awarning,externalfrom his department of a 7.7% hit to GDP over the next 15 years under a no-deal Brexit scenario,in a letter to the Treasury Committee.,external The timing of that release angered pro-Brexit MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, who said the Treasury was trying to stop Brexit, and that it consistently painted a bleak picture ""because they are frightened of taking responsibility for managing the economy without the crutch of the EU"". In the 24documents,external, which cover industries including medicine, finance and farming, it says: The cost of card payments between the UK and EU will ""likely increase"" and won't be covered by a ban on surcharges Businesses trading with the EU should start planning for new customs checks, and might have to pay for new software or logistical help Britons living elsewhere in Europe could lose access to UK banking and pension services without EU action UK organic food producers could face new hurdles to exporting to the EU Pharmaceutical companies have been told to stockpile an extra six weeks' worth of medicine to ensure a ""seamless"" supply The UK would continue to accept new medicines that have been tested in the EU Low-value parcels from the EU would no longer be eligible for VAT relief New picture warnings will be needed for cigarette packets as the EU owns the copyright to the current ones Mr Raab said reaching a deal with the EU was the ""overriding priority"" and ""by far the most likely outcome"" but that ""we must be ready to consider the alternative"". He also dismissed what he said were ""wilder claims"" about the impact of not reaching a deal, including that it could spark a ""sandwich famine"" in the UK. ""Let me assure you that, contrary to one of the wilder claims, you will still be able to enjoy a BLT after Brexit, and there are no plans to deploy the Army to maintain food supplies,"" he said.

Brexit: The key dates ahead No-deal Brexit: A costly prospect for many consumers and firms The UK will cease to be a member of the EU on 29 March 2019. With several sticking points remaining in negotiations, there has increasingly been talk of what happens if there is no agreement in place, includingpolice chiefswarning of a risk to the public if the UK loses access to EU-wide crime databases and Bank of England governor Mark Carney saying no deal would be ""highly undesirable"". Pro-Brexit campaigners have described the warnings as ""Project Fear"" - saying the UK has nothing to fear from leaving without a trade deal and falling back onWorld Trade Organization rules. Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg told the Today programme on BBC Radio 4 that such an arrangement ""would suffice"" and said the risks had been ""absurdly overstated"". His fellow Brexiteer John Redwood said stockpiling six weeks worth of medical supplies was ""a bit over the top"" but that the government was being ""ultra cautious"". Please upgrade your browser Analysis by BBC deputy political editor John Pienaar This didn't seem a comfortable moment for Dominic Raab. The Brexit secretary campaigned for Leave, and is a true believer in the cause. Yet here he was, setting out plans to cope with a British failure to reach the kind of deal Brexiteers once claimed would be easy to accomplish. Again and again, the Brexit department's guidance refers to the ""unlikely event"" of Brexit without an EU deal - but Dominic Raab conceded it could happen. The risk was real. The International Trade Secretary, Liam Fox, has suggested that outcome is more likely than not. The Brexit secretary may disagree on the level of risk, but could not deny that it would lead to higher costs and a fresh burden of red tape on businesses, scientific and medical research and individuals. Read John's blog on the no-deal papers The European Commission said Brexit would lead to disruption ""with a deal or without a deal"". ""That's why everybody, and in particular economic operators, need to be prepared,"" it said. Thecommission has already published,externalits own assessment of no deal, saying there would be ""no specific arrangement"" for EU citizens living in the UK or for UK citizens in the EU and warning of ""significant delays"" at borders. For Labour, shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer said Mr Raab's speech was ""thin on detail, thin on substance and provided no answers to how ministers intend to mitigate the serious consequences of leaving the EU without an agreement"". ""A no-deal Brexit has never been viable and would represent a complete failure of the government's negotiating strategy,"" he said. Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones said a no-deal Brexit would cause ""huge disruption and serious, long-lasting economic and social damage"", and Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable added: ""This isn't project fear by critics of Brexit, this is the government itself and independent bodies pointing to the damage that will be caused."" The National Farmers' Union warned of a ""disastrous"" cliff edge scenario for the UK food supply chain. Business group the CBI said: ""These papers show that those who claim crashing out of the EU on World Trade Organisation rules is acceptable live in a world of fantasy, where facts are not allowed to challenge ideology.""

"So what do you do after your GCSEs? Stay in education is the answer for the overwhelming majority of teens. Claire Hughes, now 22, is one of the few who bucked the trend and went out to work. In 2012, at 16, with a string of good GCSEs, Claire did two unusual things. First, she decided it was time to move out of the family home and live independently. Although she now gets on well with her parents, at the time she felt that she ""needed to try being on my own for a while"". And second, she dropped out of her A-levels. Education just did not feel important and these days she struggles even to remember what subjects she took. This was before the government brought in new ruleswhich say that in England you're meant to stay in education, or employment with training, up to the age of 18.,external These days 90% of 16-year-olds remain in education after GCSEs, according to the latest figures from the Department for Education, and even in 2012 the figure wasn't much lower. Claire moved into a little house with a friend on the other side of Sheffield, her home city, hoping that part-time work would sustain them. But they were quickly overwhelmed by the cost of everything. ""Like the cost of cheese, funny things that you don't really think about,"" she recalls. No exams but I knew I wasn't thick' National Living Wage 'fails to cover basic needs' The places with the highest and lowest wages Soon Claire had left school and was working full time as an assistant in a cupcake shop: ""I really did enjoy it."" However, the business failed and she had to do three part-time jobs, but still struggled to make ends meet. Claire says the stress got to her, harming her self-esteem and mental health. ""It got to a point after about a year when I thought this wasn't really going anywhere."" Her parents were supportive but ""a lot of people thought I had messed up"". She says: ""My friends who had gone off to Russell Group universities, I know they thought 'what the hell are you doing?'."" Claire received support from the charity Young Women's Trust, who gave her coaching to boost her confidence, skills and employability. In January 2014, she started an apprenticeship in business administration in the constituency office of one of Sheffield's MPs. She was there for 18 months, first as an apprentice and later as a secretary. ""It absolutely changed my life,"" she says. ""It opened so many doors for me. I'm really grateful for it."" Her job was to handle ""everything that came into the office communication-wise, so the inbox, the phones, the post"". ""So I could be speaking to an MP on the phone one minute and then a really distressed constituent... ""You know, it was really, really good, loads and loads of skills, organisational, people skills and communication which were really, really valuable to me... ""It was amazing."" After 18 months Claire applied for the Civil Service higher level Fast Track Apprenticeship scheme. Since she started three years ago, she has been promoted twice and earns a good salary. Claire says the job has massively boosted her confidence and kick-started her career. ""It does sound silly but being paid what I was just made me feel valuable, as if I was making a valuable contribution, and then getting the good feedback and being nurtured by some really good managers just meant that I kind of excelled in my career really. ""It gave me a bit of focus and passion and I know that's what I want to do with my career now. ""I absolutely want to stay in the public sector, in the civil service."" At the age of 22, Claire has a mortgage on her own home, a career she loves and ""absolutely no regrets"". ""I'm at the grade in the civil service now, one grade higher than graduates come in at. ""I suppose what I'm trying to say is that I am at the same place in the civil service that I would be if I had come in through the graduate scheme and I've managed to do it more quickly."" 'Although I loved cake I didn't have a passion for it ' She admits that the months immediately after she left school were tough and stressful, with poor career prospects. But the experience helped her realise that: ""Although I loved cake I didn't have a passion for it. ""I knew I didn't want to work in that kind of business."" Equally, she says that A-levels and a degree wouldn't have been right for her either. ""I've always had the mentality that you can work your way up in an organisation... ""And really the civil service is absolutely a place where you don't have to have gone to university to do well. ""I just think it's a really good place to work. It's public sector which I really like and helping other people. So really, really good."" GCSE grades not what you had hoped for?

"Honey and over-the-counter medicines should be the first line of treatment for most people with coughs, new guidelines recommend. Antibiotics should rarely be prescribed by doctors for coughs because in most cases they do little to improve symptoms, health officials say. Most of the time a cough will improve on its own within two to three weeks. The new recommendations for doctors are intended to help tackle the problem of antibiotic resistance. Overusing antibiotics is making infections harder to treat, by creating drug-resistant superbugs. A hot drink with honey - and often with lemon and ginger as well - is a well-known home remedy for coughs and a sore throat. Now new proposed guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and Public Health England (PHE) say there is some limited evidence that it can help improve cough symptoms. Cough medicines containing pelargonium, guaifenesin or dextromethorphan might also be beneficial, they say. Patients are being advised to use these treatments and wait for symptoms to improve on their own, before going to a GP. Most coughs are caused by viruses, which cannot be treated by antibiotics and will clear up on their own. Yet despite this, research has previously found that48% of UK GP practices have prescribed antibiotics for a cough or bronchitis,external. Dr Susan Hopkins, a deputy director at PHE, said: ""Antibiotic resistance is a huge problem, and we need to take action now to reduce antibiotic use... ""These new guidelines will support GPs to reduce antibiotic prescriptions and we encourage patients to take their GP's advice about self-care."" However, the guidelines recommend that antibiotics may be necessary for a cough when it is part of a more serious underlying illness, or when a person is at risk of further complications, such as those with chronic health conditions or weakened immune systems. Honey is not recommended for children under the age of one because it occasionally contains bacteria that can cause infant botulism. Dr Tessa Lewis, GP and chair of the antimicrobial prescribing guideline group, said: ""People can check their symptoms on NHS Choices or NHS Direct Wales or ask their pharmacist for advice. ""If the cough is getting worse rather than better, or the person feels very unwell or breathless, then they would need to contact their GP."" End sore throat antibiotic use, GPs told Patients 'need rest, not antibiotics' What to do if you have a cold or flu Analysis: Antibiotic apocalypse The draft recommendations are part of a raft of new antibiotic prescribing guidelines being developed jointly by PHE and NICE. England's chief medical officer, Prof Dame Sally Davies, has previously warned of a ""post-antibiotic apocalypse"". If the drugs fail, infections will become harder to treat and common medical procedures such as cancer treatments and transplants would be too risky, she said. The consultation on the new guidelines closes on 20 September. Follow Alex on Twitter,external.

"This video can not be played Australia's struggle to keep a PM on board Australian PM Malcolm Turnbull has stared down calls for his resignation amid an escalating leadership crisis that has crippled his government. Mr Turnbull is fighting to retain his position amid a push by senior colleagues to replace him as leader. But he has said he would not contest the leadership if his rivals in the Liberal Party secure enough support to bring on an internal vote. The government suspended parliament on Thursday to try to resolve the crisis. Mr Turnbull told reporters that Australians would be ""rightly appalled by what they are witnessing in their nation's parliament today"". Mr Turnbull has vowed to hold a party meeting on Friday to see if he is still supported by a majority of MPs. If his rival Peter Dutton produces a letter with sufficient signatures, Mr Turnbull has said he will vacate the leadership. Three senior Liberals have put their names forward to succeed PM Turnbull That would bring on a leadership contest. In that situation, Australian media say Mr Dutton could face off with Treasurer Scott Morrison and Foreign Minister Julie Bishop. Mr Turnbull has said he would not run. Mr Turnbull has endured poor opinion polls, losses in recent by-elections, and a revolt by the conservative wing of his party. Internal rumblings came to a head in a debate about energy and climate change policy - polarising issues for his centre-right coalition. The ex-policeman trying to oust Australia's PM Coup capital of the democratic world Australia PM fails own popularity yardstick In an attempt to appease conservatives on Monday,Mr Turnbull abandoned plans to set an emissions targetin legislation. But it made little difference:Mr Dutton launched a leadership challenge a day later. Although Mr Turnbull won, the narrow 48-35 vote was seen as damaging. On Thursday three senior frontbenchers - influential Finance Minister Mathias Cormann along with the employment and education ministers - resigned, dealing a major blow to the PM's chances of clinging to power. They joined a string of other ministers who have either stepped down or offered to. Mr Cormann, a key Turnbull supporter, said the prime minister no longer had majority party support. It prevented an entire session of Question Time, where the prime minister faces MPs in parliament, ahead of an already scheduled two-week break. This was seen as an extraordinary move. It also means all parliamentary business is halted, so no debates can be held or new laws passed. There were jeers of ""you're a disgrace"" from the opposition benches as the House of Representatives voted 70-68 to break until 10 September. Opposition Labor Leader Bill Shorten said the country ""no longer has a functioning government"". ""The government may adjourn the parliament, but they cannot outrun the weight of failure of this government,"" he said after the vote. Hywel Griffith, BBC News in Canberra Inside Parliament House, only one thing is clear - Malcolm Turnbull's time as prime minister is coming to a chaotic end. Journalists and politicians have been frantically stabbing at their phones in the hope of working out exactly what happens next. Who will be his successor? Who has the numbers? Could there be a snap election? Australia may be familiar with regularly culling its prime ministers, but it's a bloody business that doesn't follow a neat, orderly script. Meanwhile, the normal business of governing has been suspended while the ruling party has its own civil war. The past decade has been marked by a series of leadership coups, with three sitting prime ministers deposed by party rivals. Not a single leader in recent times has succeeded in serving a full three-year term as prime minister. Under the Australian system, as in the UK, the prime minister is not directly elected by voters but is the leader of the party or coalition that can command a majority in parliament. But in recent years, prime ministers unpopular in the polls - or with their colleagues - have been swiftly sacrificed from within.

"Aeolus data should mean there are fewer surprises in the forecasts A British-assembled satellite has been launched into space to make the first truly global maps of wind behaviour. The Aeolus spacecraft will get its data by firing a powerful laser down into the atmosphere to trace the movement of air particles. Meteorologists are hopeful the mission will have a big impact on the quality of medium-range weather forecasts. Aeolus launched on a Vega rocket from French Guiana at 18:20 local time (22:20 BST). The rocket was due to lift off on Tuesday, but the launch was postponed - ironically - due to high altitude winds. The satellite should begin a programme of testing once it is safely at an altitude of 320km. Team members hope that routine forecasting should be incorporating the laser's information within the year. Aeolus will fire an ultraviolet laser through the atmosphere and measure the return signal using a large telescope The light beam gets scattered back off air molecules and small particles moving in the wind at different altitudes Meteorologists will adjust their numerical models to match the information gathered by the satellite, improving accuracy The biggest impacts are expected on medium-range forecasts - those that look at weather conditions a few days hence Aeolus is only a demonstration mission but it should blaze the trail for future operational weather satellites that use lasers Aeolus: Wind satellite weathers technical storm Aeolus was originally planned to launch a decade ago Currently, there are multiple ways to measure the wind, from whirling anemometers and weather balloons to the satellites that infer wind behaviour by tracking clouds in the sky. But these are all limited indications that tell us what is happening in particular places or at particular heights. Aeolus on the other hand will gather wind data across the entire Earth, from the ground to the stratosphere (30km). The biggest benefits should come to forecasts that look a few days ahead. Bad storms in Europe, for example, will sometimes have their origin in the tropics, and when meteorologists fail to anticipate their severity it's often because the initial-state conditions given to computer models contained inaccurate wind information. The tropics are the key region where the Sun dumps its energy into the Earth system. It is this solar input that triggers the large-scale patterns of circulation in the atmosphere. ""These patterns then propagate both north and south and influence the variability at the mid-latitudes, and, in particular for medium-range forecasts, this influence is very important,"" explainedErland KÃ¤llÃ©n,external, a former director of research at theEuropean Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts,external(ECMWF). Mr KÃ¤llÃ©n, who is now director of the Centre for Climate Research in Singapore, said: ""If we don't get the tropics right in the initial state for the forecasting, we can't then get the mid-latitudes right in the medium range."" Simulations of the forthcoming data suggest Aeolus's impact will be like doubling the number of weather balloons available to meteorologists. Forecast quality is anticipated to increase by 2-4% outside of the tropics and by up to 15% in the tropics themselves. Aeolus should keep working for at least three to four years Technical problems mean Aeolus is more than a decade late. TheEuropean Space Agency,external, whose project this is, first approved the mission in 1999, with the intention of launching the satellite in 2007. But engineersstruggled to get the ultraviolet laser to workin the conditions it would experience in orbit. TheBritish arm of Airbus,external, which led the assembly of Aeolus, essentially had to mothball the chassis, or bus, of the spacecraft for several years while new designs for the laser were sought. Aeolus is arguably the most difficult mission ever implemented by Esa. Many thought it might never fly. Anders Elfving is the agency's Aeolus project manager. He told BBC News: ""Really what has fundamentally helped us - has motivated us - is the user community, because nobody else serves them with wind information globally. ""We will really still be, after sixteen years, the only supplier of it. And very soon we can give meteorologists our data pipeline and they can tell us: 'yes, you have the breakthrough we wanted'."" Aeolus is just a one-off demonstration mission, which raises the question of what happens when it inevitably reaches the end of its working life. If it delivers on its promise, forecasters will be loath to lose the advantage. But it would not be Esa's role to produce a second spacecraft. The agency is in the business of R&D, of trialling new concepts. It would be down to others to fund follow-on missions. In Europe, this would fall either toEumetsat,external, the intergovernmental organisation that runs Europe's operational weather satellites, or the European Commission through its own Earth observation programme, known asCopernicus,external. It is conceivable also that international partners, such as the US and China, would be interested in lofting a constellation of satellites.

There have been similar cases of bereaved partners receiving letters about their spouses. In JulyPayPal wrote to a woman who died of cancer saying her death breached its rules,and it might take legal action as a consequence. Lindsay Durdle died aged 37 of cancer, but her husband Howard opened a letter addressed to his wife, which claimed she owed the company Â£3,200 and she was in breach of a condition stipulated by the online payments system ""as we have notice that you are deceased"". The company said it would investigate the case, apologised, and wrote off the debt.

"This video can not be played Sylvia Marsh was left waiting for an ambulance after falling and breaking her hip A patient waited 62 hours for an ambulance, while four trusts took more than 24 hours to respond to 999 calls, new figures have shown. The longest delays in the UK were recorded by Welsh Ambulance Service, which kept four patients waiting for more than 50 hours. A spokesman said the figures were ""not typical"" and ""represent the extreme end of the waiting time spectrum"". The Patients Association said they were ""extremely concerning"". Between June 2017 and June 2018, ambulances from four services took 24 hours to reach patients, including some with breathing and mental health problems. The trusts said the longest waits were for ""less serious calls"", and they had to prioritise responding to people in life-threatening or urgent conditions. Most ambulance services also reported achieving the national target of responding to the most serious type of call in an average of eight minutes or less. Lucy Watson, from the Patients Association, said: ""Everybody should be getting the services that they need. ""We know that demand has gone up on all health services as our population is getting older, and we need to see the level of investment increasing so our ambulances can respond in a timely way."" Caroline Hardaker was told the service was ""exceptionally busy"" when she called Caroline Hardaker's mother Sylvia, 79, lay on paving stones in her back garden for three-and-a-half hours after falling and breaking her hip in High Wycombe. She said: ""I think I rang six times in the end, and each time they said they would have a clinician call back and then they didn't. ""It was so frustrating, just thinking 'how long are they going to take'? And my mum was going into shock, her arms were shaking. Her arm had gone numb. ""She was obviously cold because she was lying on a pavement. ""The ambulance and hospital staff have been fantastic - its not their fault, the whole system is breaking down. ""When I was a child you were told it would be a maximum of eight minutes for an ambulance, but three-and-a-half hours is completely unacceptable."" Paul Jefferies, from South Central Ambulance Service, which covers High Wycombe, said if patients experienced delays it was because ""higher categories of calls took priority"". Stephen Clinton, assistant director of operations for Welsh Ambulance Service, said: ""We fully accept that a number of patients waited far longer than anyone would like. ""That said, these figures represent the extreme end of the waiting time spectrum and are neither typical nor do they explain the circumstances of these individual cases."" He said in some of the cases the patients were already in the care of medical teams, and others were affected by extreme weather conditions. The service did not provide details of the four patients who waited more than 50 hours. But the longest three calls were in the second-most serious ""amber"" category, classified as ""patients who may need treatment at scene or taking quickly to health facility"". The remaining call was rated ""green"", a classification used for ""less urgent calls"". The trusts said majority of ambulances reached people within their eight-minute targets The new figures, obtained by the BBC after a Freedom of Information request, also show that between 2015 and 2017, the total number of calls received increased by 15%. In 2015, UK ambulance services received 8,892,346 calls, which rose to 9,891,559 in 2016 and 10,242,507 in 2017. An Association of Ambulance Chief Executives spokesman said resources had been stretched by ""an exceptionally long and busy winter"". An NHS Improvement spokesman said it had recently introduced an ambulance response programme to help services cope with the increasing demand. He added: ""An additional Â£36 million of funding recently announced will boost paramedic crews and improve the quality of NHS ambulance fleets.""

"Dwayne Johnson has nearly doubled his 2017 earnings Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson has nearly doubled his 2017 earnings, making $119m (Â£92m) in the past 12 months, according to Forbes highest paid actor list. The top spot was awarded to George Clooney, whose $239m (Â£180m) was already disclosed inlast month's celebrity rich list. Scarlett Johannson was revealed as the highest paid actress last week, earning $40.5m (Â£31.9m). That would have placed the Black Widow star as seventh in the male rankings. This is a departure from last year's Forbes list, which saw highest paid actress Emma Stone fail to score in the top 10 male earnings. Scarlett Johansson's earnings have risen from $10m to $40.5m in the past year, Forbes said Actors Robert Downey Jr, Chris Hemsworth, Jackie Chan and Will Smith were all in the top tier - earning more than Johannson, with seventh place Bollywood actor Akshay Kumar matching the actress's income. Completing the top 10 were Adam Sandler, US actor Chris Evans and Salman Khan. While last year's best paid actors list mainly features the same names as last year, 2017's top earner Mark Wahlberg, who made $68m (Â£52.5m), was missing entirely. George Clooney returns to this year's list, thanks to the sale of his Casamigos tequila company to drinks giant Diageo in a deal worth $1bn (Â£753m). Will Smith was sixth in this year's list of highest paid actors Dwayne Johnson's $119m (Â£92m) earnings are down to a number of box office successes, including Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle, Skyscraper, Baywatch and Fast & Furious 8. Another actor returning to this year's list is Will Smith, whose $42m (Â£32.5m) income puts him in sixth place. Smith starred in Netflix film Bright, which came out in December and is working on a number of upcoming projects including Disney's The Genie and Spies in Disguise.
