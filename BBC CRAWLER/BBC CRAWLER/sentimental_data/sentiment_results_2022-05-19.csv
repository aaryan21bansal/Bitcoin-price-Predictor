"This video can not be played Warning: This video contains distressing images An MI5 spy used his status to terrorise his partner before moving abroad to continue intelligence work while under investigation, the BBC has found. A video shows the man threatening to kill the woman and attacking her with a machete. The foreign national cannot be named, despite evidence he is a threat to women, after the government took the BBC to court to block publication. Evidence shows that he is a right-wing extremist with a violent past. In an unprecedented legal battle, the corporation argued that women had a right to know his identity and it would protect potential victims from harm. But the BBC successfully resisted the government's attempt to stop publication of the wide-ranging investigation. Beth, a British national, met the agent on a dating site. The couple went on to live together in the UK. At first, she says, he was ""charming"". They appeared to have a lot in common. But over time, he was revealed to be a misogynist and extremist, obsessed with violence and cruelty. Beth - not her real name - says he sexually assaulted her, and was also abusive and coercive. She says he used his position with the British security services to terrorise her. ""He had complete control. I was a shadow of who I am now,"" she says. As the relationship became more abusive, Beth's mental health deteriorated. ""At the end of the relationship he dictated my every waking hour - where I went, who I saw, how I worked, what I did at work, what I wore."" X made her ""feel absolutely worthless"" and used ""the fact that I had mental health problems to bully me and to make me feel more vulnerable"". He collected weapons and made her watch terrorist videos of executions and murders, she says. ""There was so much psychological terror from him to me, that ultimately culminated in me having a breakdown, because I was so afraid of everything - because of how he'd made me think, the people that he was involved with, and the people who he worked for."" She says X told her that he worked as a paid informant for the British security services - an agent or covert human intelligence source (CHIS), to use the formal term - infiltrating extremist networks. She was aware that he was having meetings with his handlers, receiving money, and being given equipment. Initially, she said, he kept his real name hidden from her. Our investigation has established that X spent years working as a CHIS for MI5, using several aliases. The security service runs agents in terrorist networks, informants who secretly work with their handlers, MI5 officers. Controversial powers authorise its agents to commit crimes as part of their cover, but only to access life-saving intelligence, disrupt more serious crime, or ensure an agent's safety. But this should not cover actions in their private lives. She says he told her she wouldn't be able to report his behaviour because of his status. ""It meant that I couldn't speak out about any of his behaviour towards me, any of the violence I went through, sexual or physical, because he had men in high places who always had his back, who would intervene and who would actively kill me, if I spoke out."" X was paid to inform on networks of right-wing extremists, but evidence we've seen shows his own alarming views are genuine. Beth says X praised various white supremacist mass murderers and stated his intent to commit similar acts. At home, his violence was directed towards Beth. In one video, the MI5 agent is seen attacking her with a machete. The incident was filmed by Beth on her mobile phone. In the lead-up to the attack, she is heard voicing concern about being killed and saying his treatment of her was unacceptable. Beth filmed the attack on her mobile phone X states he will kill her, leaves the room, and returns holding a machete - which he then raises above her head. When she is heard telling him the film could be handed to police, X launches an attack with the weapon and his fists. The video cuts out amid her screams. She managed to fight him off, but he tried to attack her again hours later with a knife, attempting to cut her throat. She says she bit his hand in order to stop him. Police visited their home after the attack, but our investigation has uncovered serious issues with the response. X was arrested, charged with assaulting Beth and appeared in court. However, while he was at court, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) dropped the case. Beth says X returned to the property and continued to mistreat her. The police did not take a full statement from Beth or obtain the video of her being attacked. The CPS quickly discontinued the prosecution. The police force concerned and the CPS insist the case was discontinued due to lack of evidence. After returning home, Beth says X claimed the security services would support him and that she was ""nothing"". A separate video, covertly filmed by Beth, captured exchanges in which X suggested she might get killed for asking too many questions. In the video, Beth asks if he will be the one to kill her. His reply implies that he had almost done just that during a previous violent episode. Lounging smugly on a sofa, he continues: ""It's constantly in me. This murderous thing is always in me.... I always imagine how I bludgeon someone to death... It's always been me.... I've been doing it since I was like six... I'm overly aggressive, I know that myself."" The couple would not remain together for much longer - X threw Beth out of their property and disappeared while another investigation against him was ongoing. While at the home after the machete attack, local police officers saw extremist material  - including X's personal propaganda. The BBC has seen a police log showing the evidence found by officers, such as a private diary in which X had written about killing ""Jews"". He had also written about killing Beth. Local officers called in counter-terror detectives, who in turn seized various items. A terrorism investigation into X ensued, but he left the UK while it was ongoing. Within weeks of him leaving, Beth had a mental breakdown and was hospitalised. While she was there, items of hers that had also been seized by counter terror officers were returned to a member of her family by a man who did not identify himself. The relative assumed the man was an associate of X. Neither Beth nor her family knew of the terrorism investigation. The family were disturbed by this visit - concerned about how the stranger knew the address and came to have Beth's possessions. We have established the visitor was an MI5 officer. Material seized by a police investigation, under a police warrant, had been given to MI5. The highly unusual move is consistent with interference in a criminal process by the security service. X's own items were also handed by police to MI5, it is understood. Counter terror police say no criminality was identified during their enquiries, but have apologised for the fact Beth's possessions were not passed directly to her. MI5's London headquarters Following her release from hospital, Beth complained to the local police force, asking why the case was dropped, why her property was taken, and why it was returned by a stranger. Police took over a year to interview her, but have since claimed there is nothing to look into as everything was investigated previously. It was not. During the course of a complaint process with the police, Beth was told the force did not hold information about her property being seized but could see from ""notes"" that some property had been taken and returned to X. Police said they did not seize any items as part of their own investigation, and were ""unable to advise when or why these were taken"". This was untrue, as the police force concerned was responsible for calling in counter terror officers. The police claim that property had been returned to X was also untrue - the material had been given to MI5. We have established that, after X disappeared, he moved abroad and began working for a foreign intelligence agency. But X also has a history of appalling abuse in that country - with his extremist and violent behaviour long predating him becoming an MI5 agent. We located and spoke to a former partner in the same foreign country. Her account of X's behaviour is equally alarming as Beth's. The two women have never met or communicated. Ruth - not her real name - says X seemed normal at first, but he eventually began abusing and terrorising her. He also threatened her life and that of her child. ""He said he would be able to kill me and my daughter, too, and then put our bodies somewhere and no-one would ever know who I am."" Fearing for her safety, she sought help from a medical organisation and was taken to a refuge. The trauma had left her unable to even speak at the time, and she was admitted to hospital. ""I was psychologically broken, really broken,"" she says. ""I kept wondering why he changed so much, but he once told me that this is his true face and that he'd been acting the whole time."" We tracked down a professional who had helped care for Ruth. He corroborated her account and described the events as perhaps the most disturbing he has ever encountered. He remembered a notebook in which X had set out his desire to kill. Ruth separately described the same item, saying it contained fantasies involving ""blood, bones, flesh. Human flesh. Eating children's flesh"". He threatened to kill and sexually abuse female children known to both Ruth and Beth. Court ruling allows BBC to tell MI5 story Let us name agent to protect women, BBC asks court Court bid to stop BBC airing MI5 agent probe Police in the foreign country were made aware of X and the threat he posed. In a disturbing echo of the way he later abused his MI5 connection, X had used the spectre of a criminal organisation to which he was linked to terrify Ruth, telling her its members could have her killed. X eventually disappeared, leaving her only his financial debts. We've found he subsequently spent years in Britain using her name, as a way of hiding his real identity, while in the pay of MI5. ""I think it's not fair and I'm angry,"" Ruth says. ""I'm very hurt. I feel cheated. You can't have trust. There is no justice."" Our investigation found evidence independent of both women that corroborates their descriptions of X. We obtained writings in the which X boasted about severely sexually exploiting women - using language that is too offensive to repeat. In other writings, he expressed approval for a young girl being raped and murdered. He openly joined a site, looking for British women, under an alias used for his MI5 work. Consistent with this, Beth says he had described searching online for women to exploit. Given the BBC was able to establish that X had a history of violence and abuse, MI5 should, similarly, have been aware. Last year a serving police officer grossly exploited his position to coerce, rape and murder Sarah Everard. There was overwhelming public concern - also voiced by government ministers - about how such a tragedy could have occurred, as well as about the state's wider response to violence against women and girls. An inquiry into her death has been announced, with the home secretary saying it ""will shine a light on the failings that allowed a serving police officer to abuse his power in such a horrific manner and make recommendations for change within policing"". The warning signs displayed by X are stark. Both of the women we interviewed think he is capable of murder. But, when we put our findings about X to the government, it took us to the High Court, trying to stop this story being made public. The court legally prevented us from naming X, because of an apparent risk to him from other extremists. The government said it ""will not comment on security or intelligence"", but the court order is ""aimed at protecting national security and avoiding a real and immediate risk to life, safety and privacy."" However, the BBC wanted to identify X so that women he is in contact with already, or those who meet him in future, could be warned.

"This video can not be played EuroMillions: Lottery winners scooped Â£184m with lucky dip ticket The UK's biggest EuroMillions lottery winners have been revealed as a couple from Gloucester who scooped Â£184m with a lucky dip ticket. Joe and Jess Thwaite won a record-breaking Â£184,262,899 - making them richer than Adele - last week. Mrs Thwaite, 44, who has two children with her 49-year-old husband, said the win will give them ""time to dream"". The previous record was held by an anonymous winner who bankedÂ£170min October 2019. After being introduced by TV presenter Dermot O'Leary at a glitzy ceremony on Thursday, Mr Thwaite confirmed that he had already left his job as a communications sales manager. His wife is also ""considering"" what to do about her role in a hairdressing salon she runs with her sister. Mrs Thwaite's initial reaction was disbelief when her husband told her the news Mr Thwaite discovered he had a win when he got up to walk the dogs at 05:15 BST last Tuesday. He said ""he didn't know what to do"" when he saw how much they had won. ""I couldn't go back to sleep, I didn't want to wake Jess up so I just laid there for what seemed like forever,"" he said. ""I spent some time searching for property with no budget limit, which was a novelty."" When his wife's alarm went off, Mr Thwaite told her: ""I've got a secret, I've got something to tell you."" Mrs Thwaite revealed her initial reaction was disbelief and she decided to get on with her routine before the couple confirmed the record win with National Lottery operator Camelot. The couple said they will use some of the money to fix their leaking roof The couple, formerly of Pershore in Worcestershire, said the win would give them ""time to share lots of experiences and go on adventures with our family and friends"". Mr Thwaite has been married to his wife, who runs the business side of the hairdressing salon with her sister, for 11 years. They have two primary school-aged children together and Joe has two university-aged children from a previous marriage. Mrs Thwaite said: ""Our two children have always talked about going to Hawaii, I've no idea why but we can now make that dream come true. ""Just to see their faces when we can make these things come true will be worth every penny."" The previous record of Â£170m was claimed by an anonymous UK player and the highest previous named winners areColin and Chris Weir, from North Ayrshire, who won Â£161m in 2011.  Â£170mBritain's richest ever lottery winner stayed anonymous after their win in October 2019. Â£161mColin and Chris Weir (pictured) from North Ayrshire, Scotland in 2011. Â£148mAdrian and Gillian Bayford, from Suffolk, in 2012. Â£123mAnonymous UK ticket-holder in June 2019. Â£122mAnonymous UK ticket-holder in April 2021. Mrs Thwaite revealed that her dad was a lifelong National Lottery player and her husband took over the mantle when he passed away seven years ago. Before his death, she explained that her father ""would always ask us what we'd do when we won"". ""It was a regular conversation and I feel like he was preparing us,"" she explained. ""Maybe that is why I seem so chilled, as I've kind of been ready to win for years."" Mr Thwaite said that when he started counting the number of digits, it was âamazing, but surrealâ The win will give the couple the money needed to work on the ""dream"" home they recently moved into. Mrs Thwaite said they bought the property to give their children a ""country-type lifestyle"" and share it with their three dogs, five chickens, two geckos and three ponies. ""Like many parents, we stretch ourselves to give our kids everything we can,"" she added. ""I always wanted them to be able to get up in their pyjamas, put wellies on and go out and feed the ponies and they can do that here. ""The fact the roof leaks and the house needs renovating was OK, as it was the life we dreamed of for our family."" The dilemma of what to do with a huge lottery win is the stuff of dreams for most people. But those lucky enough to have a huge win should plan for the future as well as readjusting to day-to-day life on their new, turbo-charged income. Here are some top tips from finance experts: Becky O'Connor, head of pensions and savings at interactive investor, said legal support, independent financial advice and an excellent accountant are key Alice Haine, personal finance analyst at Bestinvest, suggested one way to celebrate without blowing too large a sum could be to have a ""millionaire experience...whether that's taking a luxury trip, going out for a mega-expensive meal or buying a fancy car"" Ian Pickford, partner and head of financial planning at audit and tax firm Mazars, said: ""If managed correctly [a big windfall] can offer numerous generations a lifetime of financial security, but it can also cause family rifts and money troubles down the line. It's imperative that people seek the advice of experts and put a long-lasting plan in place"" Sarah Coles, senior personal finance analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, advised those suddenly coming into a fortune ""not to rush to act"" and create a financial plan Follow BBC West onFacebook,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,external.

"Greek composer Vangelis, who was known for his celebrated film themes for Chariots of Fire and Blade Runner, has died at the age of 79. He won an Oscar for the stirring score to 1981's Chariots of Fire. Paying tribute, the film's producer Lord Puttnam told the BBC Vangelis had created ""a new musical landscape"". Others sharing their memories ranged from French musician Jean-Michel Jarre to Dutch trance DJ Armin van Buuren, who said he was ""a big inspiration"". Vangelis was ""one of my heroes"" and ""just a beautiful person"",Van Buuren wrote on Twitter,external, adding: ""I still listen to his albums a lot."" Jarre wrote,externalin a tribute: ""We will all remember your unique touch and your moving melodies forever. ""You and I have always shared the same passion for synthesizers and electronic music since so long."" Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakistweeted,external: ""Vangelis Papathanassiou is no longer with us. The world of music has lost the international (artist) Vangelis."" US composerAustin Wintory wrote on Twitter,externalthat Vangelis ""changed an entire era of music"". Fellow composerBear McCreary wrote,externalthat he was ""a true musical pioneer"", saying: ""Chariots of Fire and Blade Runner were among the most innovative and influential scores in the history of the medium."" Oscar-nominated British musicianDaniel Pemberton said,externalit was ""hard to underestimate the colossal impact of Vangelis on modern film music"". He added: ""It is also hard to understand how groundbreaking Chariots of Fire was. A period British film with a phenomenal synth score."" Allow YouTube content?

Vangelis's Chariots of Fire theme famously accompanied shots of athletes running along the beach in St Andrews, Scotland, at the start of the film, which was set before the 1924 Olympics. It went to number one in the US, and later topped the UK's classical singles chart in 2012 after being performed by Mr Bean at the opening ceremony of the London Olympic Games. Lord Puttnam, who also won an Oscar for the film, said: ""I think Vangelis created a new landscape, a new musical landscape, that many other composers have taken advantage of."" He said that when he and his wife first heard the score ""every single hair at the back of my neck stood up"". Vangelis was nominated for a Golden Globe and Bafta for his score on Sir Ridley Scott's science fiction thriller, Blade Runner. Charles de Lauzirika, who produced the 1982 film, said: ""His music, not just in Blade Runner, was otherworldly in beautiful and haunting ways I lack the words to describe. ""He created lush dream states I still love getting lost in."" In addition to Blade Runner, the composer was nominated for Baftas for his scores for Missing and Chariots of Fire. The official Bafta account tweeted that he was a ""trailblazing composer"" and that its thoughts were with Vangelis' family and friends. His other film credits included The Bounty, Francesco, Bitter Moon, 1492: Conquest of Paradise and Alexander. Vangelis pictured surrounded by recording equipment in 1976 Vangelis first tasted fame as the keyboardist in the band Aphrodite's Child with singer Demis Roussos in the late 1960s. He went on to be an acclaimed and ground-breaking electronic solo artist beyond his work in film, and also enjoyed chart success with Yes frontman Jon Anderson under the name Jon and Vangelis. The pair reached the UK top 10 with I Hear You Now in 1980, and again with I'll Find My Way Home the following year. The musician released his most recent albums with the Decca record label, whose presidents Tom Lewis and Laura Monks said: ""The world has lost a genius. Vangelis created music of extraordinary originality and power, and provided the soundtrack to so many of our lives. ""We will miss him enormously. His music will live on forever."" The Greek composer once said: ""My interest was not to create a symphony orchestra, which I can very easily, but to go further than that and do things that the symphony orchestra can't do. ""And I think that I succeeded to create something like this.""

"Stormont's Department of Health must start setting up a fully-funded abortion service for Northern Ireland ""within days to weeks"", Brandon Lewis has said. The Northern Ireland secretary has taken new powers to remove the need for the executive to approve plans first. Abortion is a devolved matter but commissioning a service has been held up due to political deadlock. But Mr Lewis said his latest step means that ""barrier"" has now been removed. The UK government had indicated it wouldact after the assembly election, if an executive was not restored by then. Now Mr Lewis has done that, saying he had a ""legal and moral duty"" to intervene due to the lack of progress. He gave details of the plan to Parliament on Thursday in a writtenministerial statement.,external ""The Department of Health has said the main thing that has held them up is not being able to get this through the executive - we've taken that away, they can now crack on and deliver it,"" he told BBC News NI. ""I think this has taken far too long already, it's a complicated legal area... we will allow the department a little bit of time to deliver on this."" Brandon Lewis previously said there would be ""no further barriers"" in commissioning abortion services The secretary of state declined to give a firm deadline but said the Department of Health needed to move quickly, adding: ""I am talking days to weeks."" If that does not happen, Mr Lewis has also taken other powers that will allow the government to then set up the services itself. Timeline: Abortion in Northern Ireland Access to abortion has been available in Northern Ireland since April 2020 after new laws came into force, but it is largely limited to early medical terminations up to 10 weeks of pregnancy. Those seeking abortion services not yet provided by NI Health Trusts can access services in Great Britain through arrangements that are funded by the Department of Health. Last year, the NI Secretary ordered the Department of Health to getapproval from the executive to establish services by no later than March 2022. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) is anti-abortion and vowed to block the proposals. The party also withdrew Paul Givan as first minister in February, leading to the collapse of the power-sharing executive which he jointly chaired. The Department of Health said Robin Swann - who remains in place as caretaker health minister - was unable to bring draft commissioning proposals forward without a functioning executive. The health minister said the new regulations would be given ""careful consideration"" by the department. Mr Swann said: ""I will be seeking further legal advice, including with regard to a Northern Ireland minister of health's legal responsibilities under the ministerial code"". Sinn FÃ©in vice-president Michelle O'Neill welcomed the intervention by Mr Lewis, saying abortion services ""must be provided now"". ""Finally women will receive the modern compassionate health care they are entitled to. The commissioning of abortion services has been blocked to this point,"" she wrote in a tweet ""No more delays. It must be provided now."" DUP MP for Upper Bann Carla Lockhart said devolution should be respected. ""This should be for the people of Northern Ireland to decide what services they want, if any,"" she told BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme. ""It is for our department and our executive to do just that"". Ms Lockhart said the UK government should ""spend time on other issues"", like making changes to the Northern Ireland Protocol. ""It is absolutely vitally important that the UK government step back from this roughshod approach, take action on the issues that they need to take action on and then let the executive decide on this devolved issue"". The DUP has refused to return to Stormont since the assembly election on May 5. It blocked the election of a Speaker to a new assembly, meaning it cannot function, until its concerns about post-Brexit trading arrangements are resolved. Mr Lewis has rejected suggestions that his actions could be interpreted as a step by Westminster towards reintroducing direct rule. ""I've been very clear about my first choice, to see this done the way it should be done at Stormont,"" he said. ""It's a balance for us as this is a devolved area but we will strain every sinew to work with the Department of Health to get this done."" It is understood it could cost about Â£5m per year to run a permanent, fully-funded abortion service for Northern Ireland. Mr Lewis insisted it was ""within the budget the Department of Health has got"", without further funding from Westminster. ""Â£5m is a lot of money - but it's not a lot of money when you look at the several hundreds of millions of pounds that hasn't been spent, that the executive has already had,"" he added. ""So they've definitely got the money for this, but they have to have the determination to deliver for women in Northern Ireland."" The Department of Health said it would consider the implications of Mr Lewis's latest intervention. It also said limited abortion services for up to 10 weeks of pregnancy were already available to all women in Northern Ireland.

'Transphobic hate crime reports have quadrupled over the past five years in the UK Transgender hate crime rises by 81% Jennifer said the perpetrators were a ""small minority"". ""They are picking me out and thinking, 'Oh - let's go have some fun'. ""I can't understand their mentality. I'm not harming them and I didn't even know they existed before this all started."" If the attacks stopped, she said she could ""relax and be able to go out without worrying"" if she was going to see the perpetrators in the street. If she was able to give the perpetrators a message, she would ask them to stop. ""I don't know whether they know about the hurt they're causing,"" she told the programme. Homophobic and transphobic-motivated hate crimes are at their highest since 2004/2005, according to police figures Jennifer said she had initial hesitations about contacting the police. ""When it started, from a trans point of view, I was worried they wouldn't do anything. ""I have come along from that though and I now report every single incident. ""It was important for me to speak up because it's underreported, not by the media, but in that people are maybe scared to come forward or they won't be believed. ""I spoke up to encourage more people to stand up and say: 'No, I'm not going to let this happen anymore.' ""Whether you think it constitutes a hate crime or not, if anything is done against you or your property, I would immediately pick up that phone."" The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) Hate Crime lead Supt Sue Steen commended Jennifer's ""courage for telling her story"". A hate crime is any criminal offence which is perceived by the victim or any other person as being motivated by prejudice or hostility. She said while it is concerning that figures are at a high, she was also encouraged by the number of people who are now reporting alleged hate crimes. ""We hope the increase in figures can also be attributed to an increase in people coming forward,"" she added. However Supt Steen said many homophobic and transphobic incidents may still go unreported. ""We're not going to sit and rest on our laurels and say that we know the full picture, we don't,"" she said. ""My message to those who have been the victim of an incident or a crime, I want to reassure them that if they make that courageous step to come forward to police that it will be investigated, they will be believed, they will be supported and they will not be judged."" She told the programme that in 2020/21 the outcome rate (prosecution rate) for homophobic hate crimes was 16% and 2021/2022 it was 23%. ""It is increasing, but it's not where we want it to be,"" she said. ""It means we are only able to bring someone to justice on a quarter of the occasions it was reported as a crime. ""We want to improve that and we will continue to work at. It's absolutely something we need to get better at.""

"This video can not be played Watch: Moscow residents react to McDonald's leaving Russia after 30 years McDonald's has found a local buyer for its Russian business, after the war in Ukraine pushed it to quit the country. Alexander Govor, who currently operates 25 McDonald's restaurants in Siberia, will take on the firm's restaurants and staff, operating them under a new brand, the fast food giant said. It did not disclose the sale price, but has warned investors it would take a more than $1bn hit from the exit. McDonald's had operated in Russia for more than 30 years. The opening of its first restaurant in Moscow in 1990 came to symbolise a thaw in Cold War tensions. A year later, the Soviet Union collapsed and Russia opened up its economy to companies from the West. More than three decades later, however, it is one of a growing number of corporations pulling out as the war in Ukraine and Western sanctions make it difficult to operate. McDonald's, which had nearly 850 restaurants in the country, most of them directly owned, said it expected the deal, which is subject to regulatory approval, to close in coming weeks. Mr Govor has been a licensee of McDonald's since 2015. He is also co-founder of Neftekhimservice, a refining company, and a board member of another firm that owns the Park Inn hotel and private clinics in Siberia. Ukraine war could cause global food crisis - UN McDonald's to leave Russia for good after 30 years Russia's Industry and Trade Minister Denis Manturov said the deal was the result of a ""long and difficult"" negotiation process and the government would provide Mr Govor with all the necessary assistance to set up operations. The terms provide for McDonald's 62,000 staff in Russia to be retained for at least two years, with their existing pay and Mr Govor will pay the salaries of corporate staff in Russia until the deal is completed. McDonald's will retain its trademark in the country, it said, while the restaurants will be stripped of their menu, logo and other branding. Announcing plans for the sale earlier this week, chief executive Chris Kempczinski called the decision ""extremely difficult"". ""However, we have a commitment to our global community and must remain steadfast in our values. And our commitment to our values means that we can no longer keep the arches shining there,"" he said. McDonald's suspended operations at the restaurants it owned in Russia in March, citing the ""humanitarian crisis"" and ""unpredictable operating environment"" caused by the Ukraine war. The move drew outrage among Russian politicians and prompted threats the business would be seized. A patent application for an ""Uncle Vanya"" restaurant chain was filed with Russian authorities shortly after. The name, the same as the famous work by Russian playwright Anton Chekhov, was one of several brand knock-offs of Western companies to surface. Last year, Russia and Ukraine accounted for about 9% of McDonald's revenue. The move by McDonald's came after French carmaker Renault sold its majority stake in carmaker Aftovaz to a state research institute for a symbolic sum, while its Renault Russia business was taken over by the city of Moscow. Manufacturing at the Renault plant is expected to resume under a Soviet-era brand.

"Iceland is to launch a new discount for shoppers who are over 60, as soaring prices hit household budgets. The supermarket chain said it would offer over-60s 10% off every Tuesday to support its older customers through the cost of living crisis. The move comes as supermarkets battle for customers,with prices rising at their fastest rate for 40 years. Morrisons and Asda, which have been losing shoppers to discounters Aldi and Lidl,have already cut prices. Grocery prices were 5.9% higher in April than a year ago,according to research company Kantar. That figure was the biggest increase since December 2011, with supply chain issues, increased raw material costs and the war in Ukraine all contributing to rising food prices. Why are prices rising so quickly? Five things that are going up in price and why Iceland's new discount will be launched from 24 May, with anyone aged 60 or over able to use it every Tuesday in-store at branches of Iceland and The Food Warehouse. Shoppers will need to show proof of age, such as a driving licence or senior bus or rail pass, and the discount will cover all products, with no minimum spend. Iceland said it was the first UK supermarket to introduce such a discount and decided to do so after research by Age UK found three-quarters of older people in the UK were worried about the rising cost of living. Last Christmas, Iceland also ran a regional trial offering Â£30 vouchers to those receiving state pension and the company said it was now exploring a national rollout ready for this summer. Richard Walker, managing director at Iceland, said the chain had a ""long history"" of supporting older customers, including offering dedicated shopping hours for elderly and vulnerable people during the pandemic. ""The cost of living crisis has made support for these customers even more important, which is why I'm proud that we're finding new ways to support them, including the launch of this discount. We hope it will help all those in this age category to cut costs where they can,"" he said. UK inflation - the rate at which prices rise - jumped to 9% in the 12 months to April, up from 7% in March. The surge was driven by higher electricity and gas bills, after millions of people saw an unprecedented Â£700-a-year increase in energy costs last month. Increased fuel and food costs also contributed, according to the Office for National Statistics. Research from Kantar suggests shoppers are turning to discount retailers as pressure on budgets grows, with Aldi the fastest growing supermarket at the beginning of this year, followed by Lidl. Many rivals have also cut their prices to compete. In March Asda said it would bring out a budget range called ""Just Essentials"" in May. Its announcement came after the supermarket was criticised by food poverty campaigner and chef Jack Monroe for raising the prices of its value products or removing them from some stores. Meanwhile, last month Morrisons said it would offer an average 13% price cut on more than 500 goods. Sainsbury's also said it was trying to limit price increases despite facing higher costs from suppliers, lowering the prices of 150 of its most popular products. Shoppers could face Â£271 rise in annual food bills Supermarkets cut prices as they fight for customers Waitrose in row with Asda over budget range name Asda in food promise after Jack Monroe complaints Why are prices rising in the UK?

"Opposition parties have warned that temporary cuts to about 700 ScotRail services will be devastating for many passengers and businesses. The temporary timetable will be brought in next Monday because of a driver shortage caused by a pay dispute between ScotRail and the Aslef union. It will see the last train on many routes departing before 20:00. Nicola Sturgeon has said the timetable will get back to normal ""as quickly as possible"". ScotRail plans to cut third of services - union Train driver shortage causes wave of cancellations ScotRail goes back into public ownership ScotRail was nationalised by the Scottish government last month after the previous operator, Abellio, had its franchise ended early amid criticism of the quality of the service. Its May 2022 timetable had approximately 2,150 weekday services, but from next week this will be reduced temporarily by a third to 1,456. Hundreds of trains have been cancelled since 8 May when many drivers opted not to work overtime. Drivers' union Aslef had balloted members for strike action after rejecting a 2.2% pay offer. Similar cuts are expected to be made to the Saturday and Sunday timetables with details due to be made public in the coming days. Duringfirst minister's questions at Holyrood, Ms Sturgeon said it was vital to get rail services back to normal as quickly as possible, with the timetable to be formally reviewed on 3 June. But she said an agreement on fair pay would need to be reached with rail workers before the timetable could be reinstated. Additional drivers were also being trained up, she added. ""I expect ScotRail to make sure that this temporary timetable is just that - temporary - and the timetable gets back to normal as quickly as possible,"" she said. Ms Sturgeon also urged Aslef and ScotRail to continue negotiations to reach a settlement. She said: ""I would say to the unions that I understand their job is to represent their members and to get a fair pay deal for members, but let's see both parties get round the table and negotiate that in good faith - I think that's what the travelling public want to see as well."" Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said passengers were now paying more than ever in fares and getting the worst service seen for a generation. He also said the reduced timetable would have a profound impact on businesses as well as passengers. Mr Ross said: ""Last month, the first minister proclaimed that nationalising ScotRail was a new beginning that would deliver a railway for the nation. ""But after just seven weeks, nationalisation is already proving a disaster. As with the ferries, as soon as this government steps into sort things out, the problems get even worse. ""These cuts will also be devastating for businesses still reeling from the impact of the Covid pandemic. They are facing another lost summer."" Anas Sarwar, Scottish Labour's leader, said the first minister had overseen the biggest cuts to Scotland's railways in over half a century. Transport Minister Jenny Gilruth later told BBC Scotland'sThe Nineshe expected 38 new drivers to complete their training by the end of the summer, 55 by the end of the year, and 100 by June 2023. She said she would meet Scotrail representatives on Friday. Daily services have not yet returned to pre-pandemic levels Among the angry passengers to contact the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme was Aaron, from Fife, who said the first train he will be able to get to Edinburgh will be half an hour later than normal from Monday. He said: ""The 07:01 is the first train to Edinburgh, the next one is 08:03. This will affect people's childcare and ability to go into the office."" The last train home to Dalmeny will now be at 19:20. The brewery worker added: ""It's two-pronged for hospitality. Businesses will lose the revenue from people who won't go out, or take their cars and don't drink, and they will find it harder to employ people to work late."" Meanwhile, club and venue owner Donald MacLeod said train services being being cut would ""cripple"" the fragile recovery of hospitality after the Covid pandemic. The Night Time Industries Association Scotland described the cuts as devastating, adding that it was ""another cruel blow"" for the hard-pressed sector. Its statement added: ""The Scottish government must urgently resolve this dispute or they will be putting at risk both Scotland's economic recovery and the future of many thousands of small businesses and jobs."" ScotRail's David Simpson said how long the temporary timetable remained would depend on talks with the union, but admitted that it could be in place for several weeks. He said: ""I'd hope temporary means as short as possible but it does depend on making some progress with the pay talks which are the root cause of this problem. ""We're trying to minimise the impact of this by making the service more predictable to customers and we plan to leave this timetable in place until we make any progress in the pay talks."" He added that the pandemic had had an impact on the driver training programme. Meanwhile, the Aslef union accused the Scottish government of ""industrial vandalism"" over the cuts. Kevin Lindsay, Aslef Scotland organiser, said: ""This is what happens when you have political interference in industrial relations. ""It's time the Scottish government allowed ScotRail and Aslef to negotiate in a fair and open manner. ""These cuts will have a devastating effect on passengers and their confidence in our railway."" A Transport Scotland spokesman said: ""The difficult decision to revise the service timetable was made because of the level of disruption caused over the last two weekends by many drivers choosing not to work their rest days. ""That is of course their right and we respect that. Many of them are clearly prioritising family and leisure time over the financial benefits that come from such working."" He said ScotRail would have a full complement of drivers fully trained by October, reducing the need for drivers to work rest days.

"Sue Miller says her daughter Lowri was ""failed miserably"" by the mental health service A bereaved mother said her daughter was ""failed miserably"" by a mental health service now under review by inspectors. Sue Miller feels Lowri, 32, should not have been discharged from the Royal Glamorgan Hospital in Rhondda Cynon Taf. She died the next day. Healthcare Inspectorate Wales (HIW) is reviewing the mental health service in Cwm Taf Morgannwg Health Board over concerns about discharges. The health board said it would ""take on board"" any HIW recommendations. Health board 'failed' teen who took her own life 'I haven't had any mental health care for 18 months' Mental health sanctuaries urged for young Lowri died from a ""sudden cardiac event"" at a friend's house after taking a mixture of drugs. An inquest found doctors were unaware she had a plan to end her life when she was discharged. Coroner Graeme Hughes recorded a narrative verdict, saying he could not be convinced Lowri had intended to end her life and that ""there was no contribution to her death arising from the clinical decision to discharge her."" Lowri's family said they were disappointed with that conclusion and believe there were failings in her care. The inquest heard Lowri had told her social worker she ""did not want to be alive anymore"" and had a plan to end her life. But those concerns were not relayed to the unit's clinical director before the discharge decision was made, despite the social worker telling a member of the nursing team. Lowri was discharged days after taking an overdose while in the mental health unit Lowri had been to the Royal Glamorgan at Llantrisant because of self-harming on several occasions prior to her death. She was admitted to the hospital on 4 February 2020 after taking an overdose and was identified as a ""high risk of suicide,"" according to a review conducted by the health board. She took a further overdose while in the hospital's mental health unit and self-harmed. She was discharged after three days. Her mother Sue, from Beddau, Rhondda Cynon Taf, believes Lowri was seen as a ""nuisance."" ""With the discharge it was totally against our wishes,"" she said. ""We couldn't have been more strong in how we felt that she was a grave risk to herself. ""I didn't want her just to be a statistic that they would learn from. And here we are, because they didn't listen."" Lowri's sister Rhiannon said the hospital did not help her sister in her ""dire need"". Lowri had a happy childhood, say her family Lowri's sister Rhiannon questions the conclusion her sister's death was ""not predictable or preventable"" Sue and Rhiannon remember Lowri being a ""very happy little girl"" who had a ""fab childhood"" and loved football, but she ""went down a bad path"" in her teenage years. She got in trouble with the police on several occasions and ended up being jailed. She was later diagnosed with an emotionally unstable personality disorder. After prison, her mother says she had several ""happy and healthy years,"" but her mental health deteriorated in 2018 following a bereavement. BBC Wales Live has seen a review carried out by the health board following Lowri's death which concludes that ""this tragic incident"" was ""neither predictable, nor preventable,"" but it also raises questions about her care at the hospital. After prison, Lowri enjoyed several happy years, but her mental health was later affected by a bereavement The review found there was a ""lack of exploration"" of the concerns raised by Lowri's social worker and mother about her state of mind and ""suicidal thoughts"" and that there were ""clear expressions of hopelessness and distress"" from her. It states there was no mechanism to pause the discharge, despite the fact that Lowri was found on the bathroom floor after self-harming with a razor blade the day before and had told staff ""no one was listening to her"". It recommended that a process should be established whereby any member of the team looking after a patient, or a family member, can temporarily pause an inpatient discharge if they feel it to be unsafe. It also finds that there was no evidence of the ""escalation process"" for ""frequent attenders"" being activated. Lowri's sister Rhiannon questions the conclusion her sister's death was ""not predictable or preventable"". ""In that report, they highlighted themselves that she didn't trigger their own escalation policy. So they failed her, massively so. ""If they did nothing wrong with my sister, why is there a new discharge plan that was implemented, because of how they discharged Lowri?"" Sue would like to meet the health minister to discuss ""what is going on"" with the mental health service at the hospital. ""They haven't treated my daughter as a human being. They have failed her miserably and we've lost someone so special in our lives."" Sue and Rhiannon are looking for answers There are also broader concerns about the area's mental health service. Shortly after Lowri was released, Zara Radcliffe, who went on to kill a man in a supermarket, was discharged from the hospital after being assessed as ""low risk."" Later that year the health board said it would conduct a ""rigorous"" review of the case. HIW's review is assessing whether Cwm Taf Morgannwg's arrangements for the discharge of mental health patients into the community are ""safe and effective"". It was prompted by serious incident notifications submitted to the Welsh government, external concerns received by HIW and previous HIW mental health inspections. A report is due to be published in August. Greg Dix, Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board's executive director of nursing and patient care, said: ""We would like to offer our most sincere and heartfelt condolences to Lowri's family once again. ""We appreciate how hard it is to lose a loved one, especially in such tragic circumstances. ""We accept the coroner's verdict following the inquest into Lowri's death. ""As a health board we are committed to listening and learning which then allows us to improve the care and service we deliver to our patients. ""As part of that listening and learning, we will now work with HIW on their report and look forward to taking on board any recommendations they may make. ""Our thoughts and sympathies continue to be with Lowri's family as they try to come to terms with their loss."" For more on this story watch Wales Live on BBC iPlayer.

"Twitter has said it plans to put misleading tweets from official accounts about the Ukraine war behind warning notices. The change follows heightened scrutiny of the social media platform after the war unleashed a new surge of misinformation, sometimes from government sources. Twitter has already limited content from more than 300 Russian government accounts, including President Putin. But it also faces free speech concerns. Under the company's new ""crisis"" policies, Twitter will prioritise labelling false posts from accounts with wide reach, like state media or official government accounts, while preserving them for ""accountability"" reasons. Users will be required to click through the warning notice to view the post and Twitter will disable the ability to like, retweet or share the content. Twitter said it would also change its search and explore features to avoid amplifying false tweets. False claims that Ukraine war is a hoax go viral Twitter blocks Russian claims on hospital attack ""While this first iteration is focused on international armed conflict, starting with the war in Ukraine, we plan to update and expand the policy to include additional forms of crisis,"" Yoel Roth, Twitter's head of security and safetywrote in a blog post announcing the changes,external. Twitter said examples of problematic posts included false or misleading allegations of war crimes, false information regarding the international response and false allegations regarding use of force. The company said it would rely on multiple sources to determine when claims are misleading. Strong commentary and first person accounts are among the types of tweets that would not be challenged by the policy, it said. Twitter has approved a $44bn takeover by billionaire Elon Musk, who has criticised its content moderation policies The new policies come just weeks after Twitter's board agreed to a $44bn (Â£34.5bn) takeover offer from billionaire businessman Elon Musk, who has called for less moderated speech on the platform. He has said he would revoke Twitter's controversial ban of former US President Donald Trump, whom Twitter suspended citing the risk that he would incite further violence. by Mike Wendling, BBC Disinformation Unit Social media companies don't want to act as referees of the truth, but they now have so much power over what we see that they feel increasingly compelled to act as information judge and jury. Twitter's new crisis policies are geared towards war and conflict. It's hard not to see them through the lens of war in Ukraine, where there's been an intense information war. But of course there are other conflicts where these rules might apply - take Myanmar, where a civil war rages and wheresocial media played a key role in a deadly slaughter, according to the UN. Announcing a rule is one thing, but implementing it is another. The company uses automated systems but user reporting is rather limited. Twitter has only rolled out its misinformation reporting tool to the US and handful of other countries. And of course, there's another event on the horizon that could easily change things. You may have heard Twitter might have a new owner soon - one whose views tend to be more laissez-faire than the current management. We don't yet have a very clear idea of what Elon Musk will do about moderation - if he does eventually take control. Mr Roth said Twitter had started working on the new policies for crisis situations before the invasion of Ukraine, though the conflict had highlighted their importance. Early in the war, the company took steps to limit the reach of Russian media accounts. But it did not have a clear approach to disinformation spread by political figures or government accounts. While moderators did remove some posts, experts called the lack of strategy regarding government propaganda a ""critical gap"" in the firm's moderation policies. Last month Twitter said it had identified more than 300 Russian government accounts that it would stop recommending in timelines, notifications or elsewhere on the site. On a call with reporters, Mr Roth said the firm had seen ""both sides share information that may be misleading and/or deceptive"". ""Our policy doesn't draw a distinction between the different combatants,"" he said. ""Instead, we're focusing on misinformation that could be dangerous, regardless of where it comes from.""

"Female presenters - faces uncovered - have become common on screen in recent years The Taliban have ordered female Afghan TV presenters and other women on screen to cover their faces while on air. Media outlets were told of the decree on Wednesday, a religious police spokesman told BBC Pashto. The ruling comes two weeks after all women wereordered to wear a face veil in public, or risk punishment. Restrictions are being tightened on women - they are banned from travelling without a male guardian and secondary schools are shut for girls. One female Afghan journalist working for a local TV station in Kabul, who did not want to be named, said she'd been shocked to hear the latest news. ""They are putting indirect pressure on us to stop us presenting on TV,"" she told the BBC. ""How can I read the news with my mouth covered? I don't know what to do now - I must work, I am the breadwinner of my family.""The new decree will take effect from 21 May, Reuters news agency reported, quoting a spokesman for the Taliban's Ministry for the Prevention of Vice and Promotion of Virtue. This video can not be played (From August 2021) Female presenters return on Afghanistan's Tolo News, with one interviewing the Taliban The spokesman referred to the ruling as ""advice"" - it is not clear what will happen to anyone who fails to comply. ""Based on information received by Tolo news, the order has been issued to all media outlets in Afghanistan,"" the news channel reported. The secret girls school defying the Taliban âIt feels like being a woman is a crime hereâ Girls' tears over chaotic Taliban schools U-turn The decision is being widely criticised on Twitter, with many calling it another step by the Taliban to promote extremism. ""The world deploys masks to protect people from Covid. The Taliban deploys masks to protect people from seeing the faces of women journalists. For the Taliban, women are a disease,"" one activist tweeted. The private Shamshad news channel posted a photo of its news presenter wearing a mask, and other similar images are being shared on social media. Allow Twitter content?

During their first stint in power in the 1990s the Taliban forced women to wear the all-encompassing burka in public. The hardline Islamist movement was driven from power by US-led troops in 2001, after which many restrictions eased. Women appearing on television showing their faces became a common sight. Who are the Taliban? After retaking power last August, following the withdrawal of foreign forces, the Taliban had held off issuing new laws on what women should wear. This raised hopes they would govern Afghanistan, a deeply conservative and patriarchal country, more flexibly this time. The burka was enforced by the Taliban in the 1990s and still worn by many women Many women still wore the burka, but in bigger cities it was also common to see women continuing to wear headscarves. However in early May the Ministry for the Prevention of Vice and Promotion of Virtue announced that all women would have to cover their face in public, and indicated that a burka would be the ideal garment to achieve this. Anyone refusing to comply with the ruling risks an escalating series of punishments. Most Muslims around the world do not consider women covering their face mandatory, or oppose them working. Women are still employed in some jobs in Afghanistan, such as healthcare and education, but many others have been told not to return to work now the Taliban are back in power. The country has been plunged into economic crisis and famine under Taliban rule. Western diplomats have indicated that resuming development funding and unlocking frozen cash depends on better treatment of women. But early hopes the Taliban might relax their approach have been eroded amid signs influential hardliners in the group have the upper hand. The journalist in Kabul who spoke to the BBC wanted the international community to put pressure on the Taliban. ""They should tell them you have 10 days to change otherwise we are going to cut off relations and aid."" She said she believed the Taliban planned to stop women doing all kinds of work outside their homes. ""They want women to live like prisoners at home. Every day they issued decrees against us - I don't think we can survive.""

"Opposition parties have warned that temporary cuts to about 700 ScotRail services will be devastating for many passengers and businesses. The temporary timetable will be brought in next Monday because of a driver shortage caused by a pay dispute between ScotRail and the Aslef union. It will see the last train on many routes departing before 20:00. Nicola Sturgeon has said the timetable will get back to normal ""as quickly as possible"". ScotRail plans to cut third of services - union Train driver shortage causes wave of cancellations ScotRail goes back into public ownership ScotRail was nationalised by the Scottish government last month after the previous operator, Abellio, had its franchise ended early amid criticism of the quality of the service. Its May 2022 timetable had approximately 2,150 weekday services, but from next week this will be reduced temporarily by a third to 1,456. Hundreds of trains have been cancelled since 8 May when many drivers opted not to work overtime. Drivers' union Aslef had balloted members for strike action after rejecting a 2.2% pay offer. Similar cuts are expected to be made to the Saturday and Sunday timetables with details due to be made public in the coming days. Duringfirst minister's questions at Holyrood, Ms Sturgeon said it was vital to get rail services back to normal as quickly as possible, with the timetable to be formally reviewed on 3 June. But she said an agreement on fair pay would need to be reached with rail workers before the timetable could be reinstated. Additional drivers were also being trained up, she added. ""I expect ScotRail to make sure that this temporary timetable is just that - temporary - and the timetable gets back to normal as quickly as possible,"" she said. Ms Sturgeon also urged Aslef and ScotRail to continue negotiations to reach a settlement. She said: ""I would say to the unions that I understand their job is to represent their members and to get a fair pay deal for members, but let's see both parties get round the table and negotiate that in good faith - I think that's what the travelling public want to see as well."" Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said passengers were now paying more than ever in fares and getting the worst service seen for a generation. He also said the reduced timetable would have a profound impact on businesses as well as passengers. Mr Ross said: ""Last month, the first minister proclaimed that nationalising ScotRail was a new beginning that would deliver a railway for the nation. ""But after just seven weeks, nationalisation is already proving a disaster. As with the ferries, as soon as this government steps into sort things out, the problems get even worse. ""These cuts will also be devastating for businesses still reeling from the impact of the Covid pandemic. They are facing another lost summer."" Anas Sarwar, Scottish Labour's leader, said the first minister had overseen the biggest cuts to Scotland's railways in over half a century. Transport Minister Jenny Gilruth later told BBC Scotland'sThe Nineshe expected 38 new drivers to complete their training by the end of the summer, 55 by the end of the year, and 100 by June 2023. She said she would meet Scotrail representatives on Friday. Daily services have not yet returned to pre-pandemic levels Among the angry passengers to contact the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme was Aaron, from Fife, who said the first train he will be able to get to Edinburgh will be half an hour later than normal from Monday. He said: ""The 07:01 is the first train to Edinburgh, the next one is 08:03. This will affect people's childcare and ability to go into the office."" The last train home to Dalmeny will now be at 19:20. The brewery worker added: ""It's two-pronged for hospitality. Businesses will lose the revenue from people who won't go out, or take their cars and don't drink, and they will find it harder to employ people to work late."" Meanwhile, club and venue owner Donald MacLeod said train services being being cut would ""cripple"" the fragile recovery of hospitality after the Covid pandemic. The Night Time Industries Association Scotland described the cuts as devastating, adding that it was ""another cruel blow"" for the hard-pressed sector. Its statement added: ""The Scottish government must urgently resolve this dispute or they will be putting at risk both Scotland's economic recovery and the future of many thousands of small businesses and jobs."" ScotRail's David Simpson said how long the temporary timetable remained would depend on talks with the union, but admitted that it could be in place for several weeks. He said: ""I'd hope temporary means as short as possible but it does depend on making some progress with the pay talks which are the root cause of this problem. ""We're trying to minimise the impact of this by making the service more predictable to customers and we plan to leave this timetable in place until we make any progress in the pay talks."" He added that the pandemic had had an impact on the driver training programme. Meanwhile, the Aslef union accused the Scottish government of ""industrial vandalism"" over the cuts. Kevin Lindsay, Aslef Scotland organiser, said: ""This is what happens when you have political interference in industrial relations. ""It's time the Scottish government allowed ScotRail and Aslef to negotiate in a fair and open manner. ""These cuts will have a devastating effect on passengers and their confidence in our railway."" A Transport Scotland spokesman said: ""The difficult decision to revise the service timetable was made because of the level of disruption caused over the last two weekends by many drivers choosing not to work their rest days. ""That is of course their right and we respect that. Many of them are clearly prioritising family and leisure time over the financial benefits that come from such working."" He said ScotRail would have a full complement of drivers fully trained by October, reducing the need for drivers to work rest days.

"Sue Miller says her daughter Lowri was ""failed miserably"" by the mental health service A bereaved mother said her daughter was ""failed miserably"" by a mental health service now under review by inspectors. Sue Miller feels Lowri, 32, should not have been discharged from the Royal Glamorgan Hospital in Rhondda Cynon Taf. She died the next day. Healthcare Inspectorate Wales (HIW) is reviewing the mental health service in Cwm Taf Morgannwg Health Board over concerns about discharges. The health board said it would ""take on board"" any HIW recommendations. Health board 'failed' teen who took her own life 'I haven't had any mental health care for 18 months' Mental health sanctuaries urged for young Lowri died from a ""sudden cardiac event"" at a friend's house after taking a mixture of drugs. An inquest found doctors were unaware she had a plan to end her life when she was discharged. Coroner Graeme Hughes recorded a narrative verdict, saying he could not be convinced Lowri had intended to end her life and that ""there was no contribution to her death arising from the clinical decision to discharge her."" Lowri's family said they were disappointed with that conclusion and believe there were failings in her care. The inquest heard Lowri had told her social worker she ""did not want to be alive anymore"" and had a plan to end her life. But those concerns were not relayed to the unit's clinical director before the discharge decision was made, despite the social worker telling a member of the nursing team. Lowri was discharged days after taking an overdose while in the mental health unit Lowri had been to the Royal Glamorgan at Llantrisant because of self-harming on several occasions prior to her death. She was admitted to the hospital on 4 February 2020 after taking an overdose and was identified as a ""high risk of suicide,"" according to a review conducted by the health board. She took a further overdose while in the hospital's mental health unit and self-harmed. She was discharged after three days. Her mother Sue, from Beddau, Rhondda Cynon Taf, believes Lowri was seen as a ""nuisance."" ""With the discharge it was totally against our wishes,"" she said. ""We couldn't have been more strong in how we felt that she was a grave risk to herself. ""I didn't want her just to be a statistic that they would learn from. And here we are, because they didn't listen."" Lowri's sister Rhiannon said the hospital did not help her sister in her ""dire need"". Lowri had a happy childhood, say her family Lowri's sister Rhiannon questions the conclusion her sister's death was ""not predictable or preventable"" Sue and Rhiannon remember Lowri being a ""very happy little girl"" who had a ""fab childhood"" and loved football, but she ""went down a bad path"" in her teenage years. She got in trouble with the police on several occasions and ended up being jailed. She was later diagnosed with an emotionally unstable personality disorder. After prison, her mother says she had several ""happy and healthy years,"" but her mental health deteriorated in 2018 following a bereavement. BBC Wales Live has seen a review carried out by the health board following Lowri's death which concludes that ""this tragic incident"" was ""neither predictable, nor preventable,"" but it also raises questions about her care at the hospital. After prison, Lowri enjoyed several happy years, but her mental health was later affected by a bereavement The review found there was a ""lack of exploration"" of the concerns raised by Lowri's social worker and mother about her state of mind and ""suicidal thoughts"" and that there were ""clear expressions of hopelessness and distress"" from her. It states there was no mechanism to pause the discharge, despite the fact that Lowri was found on the bathroom floor after self-harming with a razor blade the day before and had told staff ""no one was listening to her"". It recommended that a process should be established whereby any member of the team looking after a patient, or a family member, can temporarily pause an inpatient discharge if they feel it to be unsafe. It also finds that there was no evidence of the ""escalation process"" for ""frequent attenders"" being activated. Lowri's sister Rhiannon questions the conclusion her sister's death was ""not predictable or preventable"". ""In that report, they highlighted themselves that she didn't trigger their own escalation policy. So they failed her, massively so. ""If they did nothing wrong with my sister, why is there a new discharge plan that was implemented, because of how they discharged Lowri?"" Sue would like to meet the health minister to discuss ""what is going on"" with the mental health service at the hospital. ""They haven't treated my daughter as a human being. They have failed her miserably and we've lost someone so special in our lives."" Sue and Rhiannon are looking for answers There are also broader concerns about the area's mental health service. Shortly after Lowri was released, Zara Radcliffe, who went on to kill a man in a supermarket, was discharged from the hospital after being assessed as ""low risk."" Later that year the health board said it would conduct a ""rigorous"" review of the case. HIW's review is assessing whether Cwm Taf Morgannwg's arrangements for the discharge of mental health patients into the community are ""safe and effective"". It was prompted by serious incident notifications submitted to the Welsh government, external concerns received by HIW and previous HIW mental health inspections. A report is due to be published in August. Greg Dix, Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board's executive director of nursing and patient care, said: ""We would like to offer our most sincere and heartfelt condolences to Lowri's family once again. ""We appreciate how hard it is to lose a loved one, especially in such tragic circumstances. ""We accept the coroner's verdict following the inquest into Lowri's death. ""As a health board we are committed to listening and learning which then allows us to improve the care and service we deliver to our patients. ""As part of that listening and learning, we will now work with HIW on their report and look forward to taking on board any recommendations they may make. ""Our thoughts and sympathies continue to be with Lowri's family as they try to come to terms with their loss."" For more on this story watch Wales Live on BBC iPlayer.

"A Scottish national treasure once owned by Mary, Queen of Scots, has been bought for Â£1.8m. The silver casket has been secured byNational Museums Scotland,externalfor the nation. The casket, which was made in Paris between 1493 and 1510, will go on display at the National Museum of Scotland. The rare work of early French silver is believed to have once contained letters which played a role in Mary's downfall. In December 1568, a similar chest was produced at a hearing ordered by Elizabeth I against Mary at Westminster. This contained what would become known as the Casket Letters. These love poems and letters, allegedly from Mary to her third husband, the Earl of Bothwell, implicated them both in a conspiracy to murder Mary's second husband, Lord Darnley. The museums body said the casket was a ""superb and extremely rare"" work of early French silver, very little of which survives, even in France. It is likely that its long-standing association with Mary has kept it preserved for over 450 years. For three centuries, it was owned by the family of the Dukes of Hamilton, following its acquisition, around 1674, by Anne, Duchess of Hamilton. According to a handwritten note stored with it from the late 17th century, she bought the casket, previously owned by Mary, Marchioness of Douglas, on the understanding that it had belonged to Mary, Queen of Scots. The note records the belief it is the genuine article involved in the Lord Darnley conspiracy. The silver casket is believed to have been owned by Mary Queen of Scots, who was held in captivity for 19 years before she was executed The casket was acquired by National Museums Scotland from Lennoxlove House Ltd, its owner since the middle of the 20th Century. The Â£1.8m cost was met with support from the National Heritage Memorial Fund, Art Fund, the Scottish government and several trusts, foundations and individual donors. The sale was managed by Sotheby's. Dr Chris Breward, director of National Museums Scotland said: ""This extraordinary casket is truly one of Scotland's national treasures. ""Venerated as a relic of Mary for centuries, it is believed to represent a momentous and disastrous moment in her turbulent life. ""Beyond this, the magnificence of the piece speaks to a queen at the height of her powers, wealth and position. ""I am delighted that this beautiful object has been acquired for the nation."" It is thought that the casket was given to Mary by her first husband, FranÃ§ois II of France, and came to Scotland with her in 1561 after his death in 1560. Her inventories from this time listed multiple examples of precious jewellery and other such valuable objects. A casket first appeared in records following Mary's arrest in 1567 by the rebellious Confederate Lords, when it was discovered in the hands of Lord Bothwell's servant. It was brought before the Scottish Privy Council where its lock was struck off to reveal its contents. What these were at the time is unknown. However, a year later, when the Earl of Moray produced the same casket at Westminster, it now contained the damning Casket Letters. Queen's death mask goes on show,external Scotland's history: Mary Queen of Scots The authorship of the letters remains a subject of debate, but it is widely thought that they were doctored. Following the hearing at Westminster, Mary remained in English captivity for 19 years, until she was executed in 1587 for her involvement in the Babington Plot to assassinate Elizabeth I, and place Mary on the English throne. The National Heritage Memorial Fund contributed Â£810,000 towards the acquisition. A spokesman said: ""Not only will memorial funding bring an object of great national importance into public ownership, it will bring to life the story and secrets of the casket and of Mary Queen of Scots to a whole new generation of visitors at the National Museums of Scotland ."" Culture Minister Neil Gray said: ""I'm delighted that the Scottish government's contribution of Â£200,000 to the National Museums Scotland Acquisitions Fund has helped to secure this exquisite casket for the nation. ""Quite apart from the colourful history associated with the item, given the belief that it belonged to Mary, Queen of Scots, the silver casket is a stunning work of art in its own right."" Lennoxlove House said the casket's sale would enable the long-term maintenance of the house and its contents.

"This video can not be played Nadine Dorries says which media outlets she appears on is her choice while being questioned about the sale of Channel 4, Channel 4 News has sometimes not done itself ""any favours"" in terms of impartiality, Nadine Dorries has said. The culture secretary - who is pushing for the network to be privatised - rejected claims she was seeking vengeance against it as ""laughable"". But she told MPs she would not ""justify a news organisation whose anchor went out to shout obscenities at Tories"" - areference to claims about Jon Snow,external. Ms Dorries also told MPs she shared her Netflix account with others. Speaking to the Commons culture committee, the minister praised the streaming service's ""incredibly generous system"". ""I mean my mum has access to my account. I have Netflix but there are four other people who can use my Netflix account in different parts of the country."" ""Am I not supposed to do that?"" she added with a laugh. What could privatising Channel 4 mean? Dorries: Tough times that shaped my political life How much is the BBC licence fee and why is it under threat? Netflix has previously said users sharing their passwords with others was ""something you have to learn to live with"". However, following a fall in subscribers,the company has suggestedit wants to crack down on the practice. The culture secretary also defended her decision to privatise Channel 4, arguing it would prevent the network from being too reliant on revenues from advertising. Pressed on why she had not recently appeared on the broadcaster's evening news show, she said she got on ""really well"" with Cathy Newman, one of the presenters, but that invitations to appear often came at ""really short notice"". She said the programme was ""edgy"", but added: ""I'm not going to justify a news programme whose new anchor went out shouting obscenities about the Conservative Party. ""So they didn't do themselves any favours sometimes on the news programme and I think that is probably as much as I want to say about that."" Channel 4 stars including Derry Girls' Saoirse-Monica Jackson has spoken out against privatisation In 2017, Conservative MPs attacked the programme's presenter Jon Snow, after a claim he shouted obscenities about Conservatives - although Mr Snow said he did not have any recollection of the incident. But Ms Dorries, said it was ""laughable"" when asked if selling Channel 4 was ""vengeance"" for its news coverage. Channel 4 News editor Esme Wren said the network's output was ""internationally-renowned for the depth and quality of its coverage ranging"". ""Since the start of 2022, Channel 4 News has seen the biggest increase in audience share across all the public service broadcasting national main news programmes and is up by 43% among younger viewers aged 16-34 year-on-year."" Channel 4 has objected to the government's privatisation plans, saying it was ""disappointing"" that ministers had made their decision despite ""significant public interest concerns"". Ms Dorries insisted the move would allow Channel 4 to raise investment and that it was ""a great time to sell"". Chief executive Alex Mahon said privatisation would ""make a negative impact on the creative industries across the UK"". During the committee hearing, Ms Dorries also told MPs a review of how the BBC is funded would start before Parliament's summer recess at the end of July.

Conservative MP Damian Green asked the minister if, given she had made up her mind, the consultation was ""a sham"".

"Stormont's Department of Health must start setting up a fully-funded abortion service for Northern Ireland ""within days to weeks"", Brandon Lewis has said. The Northern Ireland secretary has taken new powers to remove the need for the executive to approve plans first. Abortion is a devolved matter but commissioning a service has been held up due to political deadlock. But Mr Lewis said his latest step means that ""barrier"" has now been removed. The UK government had indicated it wouldact after the assembly election, if an executive was not restored by then. Now Mr Lewis has done that, saying he had a ""legal and moral duty"" to intervene due to the lack of progress. He gave details of the plan to Parliament on Thursday in a writtenministerial statement.,external ""The Department of Health has said the main thing that has held them up is not being able to get this through the executive - we've taken that away, they can now crack on and deliver it,"" he told BBC News NI. ""I think this has taken far too long already, it's a complicated legal area... we will allow the department a little bit of time to deliver on this."" Brandon Lewis previously said there would be ""no further barriers"" in commissioning abortion services The secretary of state declined to give a firm deadline but said the Department of Health needed to move quickly, adding: ""I am talking days to weeks."" If that does not happen, Mr Lewis has also taken other powers that will allow the government to then set up the services itself. Timeline: Abortion in Northern Ireland Access to abortion has been available in Northern Ireland since April 2020 after new laws came into force, but it is largely limited to early medical terminations up to 10 weeks of pregnancy. Those seeking abortion services not yet provided by NI Health Trusts can access services in Great Britain through arrangements that are funded by the Department of Health. Last year, the NI Secretary ordered the Department of Health to getapproval from the executive to establish services by no later than March 2022. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) is anti-abortion and vowed to block the proposals. The party also withdrew Paul Givan as first minister in February, leading to the collapse of the power-sharing executive which he jointly chaired. The Department of Health said Robin Swann - who remains in place as caretaker health minister - was unable to bring draft commissioning proposals forward without a functioning executive. The health minister said the new regulations would be given ""careful consideration"" by the department. Mr Swann said: ""I will be seeking further legal advice, including with regard to a Northern Ireland minister of health's legal responsibilities under the ministerial code"". Sinn FÃ©in vice-president Michelle O'Neill welcomed the intervention by Mr Lewis, saying abortion services ""must be provided now"". ""Finally women will receive the modern compassionate health care they are entitled to. The commissioning of abortion services has been blocked to this point,"" she wrote in a tweet ""No more delays. It must be provided now."" DUP MP for Upper Bann Carla Lockhart said devolution should be respected. ""This should be for the people of Northern Ireland to decide what services they want, if any,"" she told BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme. ""It is for our department and our executive to do just that"". Ms Lockhart said the UK government should ""spend time on other issues"", like making changes to the Northern Ireland Protocol. ""It is absolutely vitally important that the UK government step back from this roughshod approach, take action on the issues that they need to take action on and then let the executive decide on this devolved issue"". The DUP has refused to return to Stormont since the assembly election on May 5. It blocked the election of a Speaker to a new assembly, meaning it cannot function, until its concerns about post-Brexit trading arrangements are resolved. Mr Lewis has rejected suggestions that his actions could be interpreted as a step by Westminster towards reintroducing direct rule. ""I've been very clear about my first choice, to see this done the way it should be done at Stormont,"" he said. ""It's a balance for us as this is a devolved area but we will strain every sinew to work with the Department of Health to get this done."" It is understood it could cost about Â£5m per year to run a permanent, fully-funded abortion service for Northern Ireland. Mr Lewis insisted it was ""within the budget the Department of Health has got"", without further funding from Westminster. ""Â£5m is a lot of money - but it's not a lot of money when you look at the several hundreds of millions of pounds that hasn't been spent, that the executive has already had,"" he added. ""So they've definitely got the money for this, but they have to have the determination to deliver for women in Northern Ireland."" The Department of Health said it would consider the implications of Mr Lewis's latest intervention. It also said limited abortion services for up to 10 weeks of pregnancy were already available to all women in Northern Ireland.

"This video can not be played Warning: This video contains distressing images An MI5 spy used his status to terrorise his partner before moving abroad to continue intelligence work while under investigation, the BBC has found. A video shows the man threatening to kill the woman and attacking her with a machete. The foreign national cannot be named, despite evidence he is a threat to women, after the government took the BBC to court to block publication. Evidence shows that he is a right-wing extremist with a violent past. In an unprecedented legal battle, the corporation argued that women had a right to know his identity and it would protect potential victims from harm. But the BBC successfully resisted the government's attempt to stop publication of the wide-ranging investigation. Beth, a British national, met the agent on a dating site. The couple went on to live together in the UK. At first, she says, he was ""charming"". They appeared to have a lot in common. But over time, he was revealed to be a misogynist and extremist, obsessed with violence and cruelty. Beth - not her real name - says he sexually assaulted her, and was also abusive and coercive. She says he used his position with the British security services to terrorise her. ""He had complete control. I was a shadow of who I am now,"" she says. As the relationship became more abusive, Beth's mental health deteriorated. ""At the end of the relationship he dictated my every waking hour - where I went, who I saw, how I worked, what I did at work, what I wore."" X made her ""feel absolutely worthless"" and used ""the fact that I had mental health problems to bully me and to make me feel more vulnerable"". He collected weapons and made her watch terrorist videos of executions and murders, she says. ""There was so much psychological terror from him to me, that ultimately culminated in me having a breakdown, because I was so afraid of everything - because of how he'd made me think, the people that he was involved with, and the people who he worked for."" She says X told her that he worked as a paid informant for the British security services - an agent or covert human intelligence source (CHIS), to use the formal term - infiltrating extremist networks. She was aware that he was having meetings with his handlers, receiving money, and being given equipment. Initially, she said, he kept his real name hidden from her. Our investigation has established that X spent years working as a CHIS for MI5, using several aliases. The security service runs agents in terrorist networks, informants who secretly work with their handlers, MI5 officers. Controversial powers authorise its agents to commit crimes as part of their cover, but only to access life-saving intelligence, disrupt more serious crime, or ensure an agent's safety. But this should not cover actions in their private lives. She says he told her she wouldn't be able to report his behaviour because of his status. ""It meant that I couldn't speak out about any of his behaviour towards me, any of the violence I went through, sexual or physical, because he had men in high places who always had his back, who would intervene and who would actively kill me, if I spoke out."" X was paid to inform on networks of right-wing extremists, but evidence we've seen shows his own alarming views are genuine. Beth says X praised various white supremacist mass murderers and stated his intent to commit similar acts. At home, his violence was directed towards Beth. In one video, the MI5 agent is seen attacking her with a machete. The incident was filmed by Beth on her mobile phone. In the lead-up to the attack, she is heard voicing concern about being killed and saying his treatment of her was unacceptable. Beth filmed the attack on her mobile phone X states he will kill her, leaves the room, and returns holding a machete - which he then raises above her head. When she is heard telling him the film could be handed to police, X launches an attack with the weapon and his fists. The video cuts out amid her screams. She managed to fight him off, but he tried to attack her again hours later with a knife, attempting to cut her throat. She says she bit his hand in order to stop him. Police visited their home after the attack, but our investigation has uncovered serious issues with the response. X was arrested, charged with assaulting Beth and appeared in court. However, while he was at court, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) dropped the case. Beth says X returned to the property and continued to mistreat her. The police did not take a full statement from Beth or obtain the video of her being attacked. The CPS quickly discontinued the prosecution. The police force concerned and the CPS insist the case was discontinued due to lack of evidence. After returning home, Beth says X claimed the security services would support him and that she was ""nothing"". A separate video, covertly filmed by Beth, captured exchanges in which X suggested she might get killed for asking too many questions. In the video, Beth asks if he will be the one to kill her. His reply implies that he had almost done just that during a previous violent episode. Lounging smugly on a sofa, he continues: ""It's constantly in me. This murderous thing is always in me.... I always imagine how I bludgeon someone to death... It's always been me.... I've been doing it since I was like six... I'm overly aggressive, I know that myself."" The couple would not remain together for much longer - X threw Beth out of their property and disappeared while another investigation against him was ongoing. While at the home after the machete attack, local police officers saw extremist material  - including X's personal propaganda. The BBC has seen a police log showing the evidence found by officers, such as a private diary in which X had written about killing ""Jews"". He had also written about killing Beth. Local officers called in counter-terror detectives, who in turn seized various items. A terrorism investigation into X ensued, but he left the UK while it was ongoing. Within weeks of him leaving, Beth had a mental breakdown and was hospitalised. While she was there, items of hers that had also been seized by counter terror officers were returned to a member of her family by a man who did not identify himself. The relative assumed the man was an associate of X. Neither Beth nor her family knew of the terrorism investigation. The family were disturbed by this visit - concerned about how the stranger knew the address and came to have Beth's possessions. We have established the visitor was an MI5 officer. Material seized by a police investigation, under a police warrant, had been given to MI5. The highly unusual move is consistent with interference in a criminal process by the security service. X's own items were also handed by police to MI5, it is understood. Counter terror police say no criminality was identified during their enquiries, but have apologised for the fact Beth's possessions were not passed directly to her. MI5's London headquarters Following her release from hospital, Beth complained to the local police force, asking why the case was dropped, why her property was taken, and why it was returned by a stranger. Police took over a year to interview her, but have since claimed there is nothing to look into as everything was investigated previously. It was not. During the course of a complaint process with the police, Beth was told the force did not hold information about her property being seized but could see from ""notes"" that some property had been taken and returned to X. Police said they did not seize any items as part of their own investigation, and were ""unable to advise when or why these were taken"". This was untrue, as the police force concerned was responsible for calling in counter terror officers. The police claim that property had been returned to X was also untrue - the material had been given to MI5. We have established that, after X disappeared, he moved abroad and began working for a foreign intelligence agency. But X also has a history of appalling abuse in that country - with his extremist and violent behaviour long predating him becoming an MI5 agent. We located and spoke to a former partner in the same foreign country. Her account of X's behaviour is equally alarming as Beth's. The two women have never met or communicated. Ruth - not her real name - says X seemed normal at first, but he eventually began abusing and terrorising her. He also threatened her life and that of her child. ""He said he would be able to kill me and my daughter, too, and then put our bodies somewhere and no-one would ever know who I am."" Fearing for her safety, she sought help from a medical organisation and was taken to a refuge. The trauma had left her unable to even speak at the time, and she was admitted to hospital. ""I was psychologically broken, really broken,"" she says. ""I kept wondering why he changed so much, but he once told me that this is his true face and that he'd been acting the whole time."" We tracked down a professional who had helped care for Ruth. He corroborated her account and described the events as perhaps the most disturbing he has ever encountered. He remembered a notebook in which X had set out his desire to kill. Ruth separately described the same item, saying it contained fantasies involving ""blood, bones, flesh. Human flesh. Eating children's flesh"". He threatened to kill and sexually abuse female children known to both Ruth and Beth. Court ruling allows BBC to tell MI5 story Let us name agent to protect women, BBC asks court Court bid to stop BBC airing MI5 agent probe Police in the foreign country were made aware of X and the threat he posed. In a disturbing echo of the way he later abused his MI5 connection, X had used the spectre of a criminal organisation to which he was linked to terrify Ruth, telling her its members could have her killed. X eventually disappeared, leaving her only his financial debts. We've found he subsequently spent years in Britain using her name, as a way of hiding his real identity, while in the pay of MI5. ""I think it's not fair and I'm angry,"" Ruth says. ""I'm very hurt. I feel cheated. You can't have trust. There is no justice."" Our investigation found evidence independent of both women that corroborates their descriptions of X. We obtained writings in the which X boasted about severely sexually exploiting women - using language that is too offensive to repeat. In other writings, he expressed approval for a young girl being raped and murdered. He openly joined a site, looking for British women, under an alias used for his MI5 work. Consistent with this, Beth says he had described searching online for women to exploit. Given the BBC was able to establish that X had a history of violence and abuse, MI5 should, similarly, have been aware. Last year a serving police officer grossly exploited his position to coerce, rape and murder Sarah Everard. There was overwhelming public concern - also voiced by government ministers - about how such a tragedy could have occurred, as well as about the state's wider response to violence against women and girls. An inquiry into her death has been announced, with the home secretary saying it ""will shine a light on the failings that allowed a serving police officer to abuse his power in such a horrific manner and make recommendations for change within policing"". The warning signs displayed by X are stark. Both of the women we interviewed think he is capable of murder. But, when we put our findings about X to the government, it took us to the High Court, trying to stop this story being made public. The court legally prevented us from naming X, because of an apparent risk to him from other extremists. The government said it ""will not comment on security or intelligence"", but the court order is ""aimed at protecting national security and avoiding a real and immediate risk to life, safety and privacy."" However, the BBC wanted to identify X so that women he is in contact with already, or those who meet him in future, could be warned.

"Opposition parties have warned that temporary cuts to about 700 ScotRail services will be devastating for many passengers and businesses. The temporary timetable will be brought in next Monday because of a driver shortage caused by a pay dispute between ScotRail and the Aslef union. It will see the last train on many routes departing before 20:00. Nicola Sturgeon has said the timetable will get back to normal ""as quickly as possible"". ScotRail plans to cut third of services - union Train driver shortage causes wave of cancellations ScotRail goes back into public ownership ScotRail was nationalised by the Scottish government last month after the previous operator, Abellio, had its franchise ended early amid criticism of the quality of the service. Its May 2022 timetable had approximately 2,150 weekday services, but from next week this will be reduced temporarily by a third to 1,456. Hundreds of trains have been cancelled since 8 May when many drivers opted not to work overtime. Drivers' union Aslef had balloted members for strike action after rejecting a 2.2% pay offer. Similar cuts are expected to be made to the Saturday and Sunday timetables with details due to be made public in the coming days. Duringfirst minister's questions at Holyrood, Ms Sturgeon said it was vital to get rail services back to normal as quickly as possible, with the timetable to be formally reviewed on 3 June. But she said an agreement on fair pay would need to be reached with rail workers before the timetable could be reinstated. Additional drivers were also being trained up, she added. ""I expect ScotRail to make sure that this temporary timetable is just that - temporary - and the timetable gets back to normal as quickly as possible,"" she said. Ms Sturgeon also urged Aslef and ScotRail to continue negotiations to reach a settlement. She said: ""I would say to the unions that I understand their job is to represent their members and to get a fair pay deal for members, but let's see both parties get round the table and negotiate that in good faith - I think that's what the travelling public want to see as well."" Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said passengers were now paying more than ever in fares and getting the worst service seen for a generation. He also said the reduced timetable would have a profound impact on businesses as well as passengers. Mr Ross said: ""Last month, the first minister proclaimed that nationalising ScotRail was a new beginning that would deliver a railway for the nation. ""But after just seven weeks, nationalisation is already proving a disaster. As with the ferries, as soon as this government steps into sort things out, the problems get even worse. ""These cuts will also be devastating for businesses still reeling from the impact of the Covid pandemic. They are facing another lost summer."" Anas Sarwar, Scottish Labour's leader, said the first minister had overseen the biggest cuts to Scotland's railways in over half a century. Transport Minister Jenny Gilruth later told BBC Scotland'sThe Nineshe expected 38 new drivers to complete their training by the end of the summer, 55 by the end of the year, and 100 by June 2023. She said she would meet Scotrail representatives on Friday. Daily services have not yet returned to pre-pandemic levels Among the angry passengers to contact the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme was Aaron, from Fife, who said the first train he will be able to get to Edinburgh will be half an hour later than normal from Monday. He said: ""The 07:01 is the first train to Edinburgh, the next one is 08:03. This will affect people's childcare and ability to go into the office."" The last train home to Dalmeny will now be at 19:20. The brewery worker added: ""It's two-pronged for hospitality. Businesses will lose the revenue from people who won't go out, or take their cars and don't drink, and they will find it harder to employ people to work late."" Meanwhile, club and venue owner Donald MacLeod said train services being being cut would ""cripple"" the fragile recovery of hospitality after the Covid pandemic. The Night Time Industries Association Scotland described the cuts as devastating, adding that it was ""another cruel blow"" for the hard-pressed sector. Its statement added: ""The Scottish government must urgently resolve this dispute or they will be putting at risk both Scotland's economic recovery and the future of many thousands of small businesses and jobs."" ScotRail's David Simpson said how long the temporary timetable remained would depend on talks with the union, but admitted that it could be in place for several weeks. He said: ""I'd hope temporary means as short as possible but it does depend on making some progress with the pay talks which are the root cause of this problem. ""We're trying to minimise the impact of this by making the service more predictable to customers and we plan to leave this timetable in place until we make any progress in the pay talks."" He added that the pandemic had had an impact on the driver training programme. Meanwhile, the Aslef union accused the Scottish government of ""industrial vandalism"" over the cuts. Kevin Lindsay, Aslef Scotland organiser, said: ""This is what happens when you have political interference in industrial relations. ""It's time the Scottish government allowed ScotRail and Aslef to negotiate in a fair and open manner. ""These cuts will have a devastating effect on passengers and their confidence in our railway."" A Transport Scotland spokesman said: ""The difficult decision to revise the service timetable was made because of the level of disruption caused over the last two weekends by many drivers choosing not to work their rest days. ""That is of course their right and we respect that. Many of them are clearly prioritising family and leisure time over the financial benefits that come from such working."" He said ScotRail would have a full complement of drivers fully trained by October, reducing the need for drivers to work rest days.

"This video can not be played EuroMillions: Lottery winners scooped Â£184m with lucky dip ticket The UK's biggest EuroMillions lottery winners have been revealed as a couple from Gloucester who scooped Â£184m with a lucky dip ticket. Joe and Jess Thwaite won a record-breaking Â£184,262,899 - making them richer than Adele - last week. Mrs Thwaite, 44, who has two children with her 49-year-old husband, said the win will give them ""time to dream"". The previous record was held by an anonymous winner who bankedÂ£170min October 2019. After being introduced by TV presenter Dermot O'Leary at a glitzy ceremony on Thursday, Mr Thwaite confirmed that he had already left his job as a communications sales manager. His wife is also ""considering"" what to do about her role in a hairdressing salon she runs with her sister. Mrs Thwaite's initial reaction was disbelief when her husband told her the news Mr Thwaite discovered he had a win when he got up to walk the dogs at 05:15 BST last Tuesday. He said ""he didn't know what to do"" when he saw how much they had won. ""I couldn't go back to sleep, I didn't want to wake Jess up so I just laid there for what seemed like forever,"" he said. ""I spent some time searching for property with no budget limit, which was a novelty."" When his wife's alarm went off, Mr Thwaite told her: ""I've got a secret, I've got something to tell you."" Mrs Thwaite revealed her initial reaction was disbelief and she decided to get on with her routine before the couple confirmed the record win with National Lottery operator Camelot. The couple said they will use some of the money to fix their leaking roof The couple, formerly of Pershore in Worcestershire, said the win would give them ""time to share lots of experiences and go on adventures with our family and friends"". Mr Thwaite has been married to his wife, who runs the business side of the hairdressing salon with her sister, for 11 years. They have two primary school-aged children together and Joe has two university-aged children from a previous marriage. Mrs Thwaite said: ""Our two children have always talked about going to Hawaii, I've no idea why but we can now make that dream come true. ""Just to see their faces when we can make these things come true will be worth every penny."" The previous record of Â£170m was claimed by an anonymous UK player and the highest previous named winners areColin and Chris Weir, from North Ayrshire, who won Â£161m in 2011.

Mrs Thwaite revealed that her dad was a lifelong National Lottery player and her husband took over the mantle when he passed away seven years ago. Before his death, she explained that her father ""would always ask us what we'd do when we won"". ""It was a regular conversation and I feel like he was preparing us,"" she explained. ""Maybe that is why I seem so chilled, as I've kind of been ready to win for years."" Mr Thwaite said that when he started counting the number of digits, it was âamazing, but surrealâ The win will give the couple the money needed to work on the ""dream"" home they recently moved into. Mrs Thwaite said they bought the property to give their children a ""country-type lifestyle"" and share it with their three dogs, five chickens, two geckos and three ponies. ""Like many parents, we stretch ourselves to give our kids everything we can,"" she added. ""I always wanted them to be able to get up in their pyjamas, put wellies on and go out and feed the ponies and they can do that here. ""The fact the roof leaks and the house needs renovating was OK, as it was the life we dreamed of for our family."" The dilemma of what to do with a huge lottery win is the stuff of dreams for most people. But those lucky enough to have a huge win should plan for the future as well as readjusting to day-to-day life on their new, turbo-charged income. Here are some top tips from finance experts: Becky O'Connor, head of pensions and savings at interactive investor, said legal support, independent financial advice and an excellent accountant are key Alice Haine, personal finance analyst at Bestinvest, suggested one way to celebrate without blowing too large a sum could be to have a ""millionaire experience...whether that's taking a luxury trip, going out for a mega-expensive meal or buying a fancy car"" Ian Pickford, partner and head of financial planning at audit and tax firm Mazars, said: ""If managed correctly [a big windfall] can offer numerous generations a lifetime of financial security, but it can also cause family rifts and money troubles down the line.

"The prices of parcels and stamps are likely to rise again as Royal Mail tries to cover higher costs, including wages, energy and fuel expenses. The firm said it would try to ""mitigate"" the costs through ""price increases and growth initiatives"". Earlier this year, the firm hiked first class stamp prices by 10p to 95p and second class stamps by 2p to 68p. The warning comes after Royal Mail warned it was facing ""significant headwinds"" from rising costs. It said it will need to cut costs more as a result, increasing its target to over Â£350m from Â£290m previously. A spokeswoman said: ""We haven't made decisions on future prices, but we always carefully consider the impact on our customers and ensure that any changes help to secure the sustainability of the Universal Service."" Royal Mail said it was also continuing to change the business to cope better as its parcel business becomes more important than letter delivery. Letter volumes have fallen by more than 60% since their peak in 2004-05 and by about 20% since the pandemic began. Meanwhile, parcel deliveries increased during the pandemic. Simon Thompson, chief executive of Royal Mail, said: ""As we emerge from the pandemic, the need to accelerate the transformation of our business, particularly in delivery, has become more urgent. ""Our future is as a parcels business, so we need to adapt old ways of working designed for letters and do it much more quickly to a world increasingly dominated by parcels."" Royal Mail wants fleet of 500 drones to carry mail New stamps released to honour the Spitfire Women Royal Mail to cut jobs amid ongoing postal delays Mr Thompson said that the focus would now be to ""work at pace"" with staff and trade unions to ""reinvent this British icon for the next generations"",  give customers ""what they want"" grow the business sustainably and ""deliver long-term job security"". The price hike warning came as the business reported an 8.8% drop in pre-tax profit to Â£662m for the year to the end of March. Royal Mail is also facing an ongoing pay dispute with its largest labour union. In January it said around 700 management roles would be cut. The company also axed a fifth of its managers - around 2,000 posts - in June 2020, shortly after the start of the pandemic. Earlier this year the company was heavily criticised for delivery disruptions over Christmas and January. Citizens Advice estimated that 2.5 million Royal Mail customers didn't receive important documents such as health appointments, fines or bills. Royal Mail said the wave of Omicron infections meant that thousands of staff members had to take time off over Christmas and January. But it said the ""vast majority"" of post was delivered on time.

"This video can not be played Watch: Moscow residents react to McDonald's leaving Russia after 30 years McDonald's has found a local buyer for its Russian business, after the war in Ukraine pushed it to quit the country. Alexander Govor, who currently operates 25 McDonald's restaurants in Siberia, will take on the firm's restaurants and staff, operating them under a new brand, the fast food giant said. It did not disclose the sale price, but has warned investors it would take a more than $1bn hit from the exit. McDonald's had operated in Russia for more than 30 years. The opening of its first restaurant in Moscow in 1990 came to symbolise a thaw in Cold War tensions. A year later, the Soviet Union collapsed and Russia opened up its economy to companies from the West. More than three decades later, however, it is one of a growing number of corporations pulling out as the war in Ukraine and Western sanctions make it difficult to operate. McDonald's, which had nearly 850 restaurants in the country, most of them directly owned, said it expected the deal, which is subject to regulatory approval, to close in coming weeks. Mr Govor has been a licensee of McDonald's since 2015. He is also co-founder of Neftekhimservice, a refining company, and a board member of another firm that owns the Park Inn hotel and private clinics in Siberia. Ukraine war could cause global food crisis - UN McDonald's to leave Russia for good after 30 years Russia's Industry and Trade Minister Denis Manturov said the deal was the result of a ""long and difficult"" negotiation process and the government would provide Mr Govor with all the necessary assistance to set up operations. The terms provide for McDonald's 62,000 staff in Russia to be retained for at least two years, with their existing pay and Mr Govor will pay the salaries of corporate staff in Russia until the deal is completed. McDonald's will retain its trademark in the country, it said, while the restaurants will be stripped of their menu, logo and other branding. Announcing plans for the sale earlier this week, chief executive Chris Kempczinski called the decision ""extremely difficult"". ""However, we have a commitment to our global community and must remain steadfast in our values. And our commitment to our values means that we can no longer keep the arches shining there,"" he said. McDonald's suspended operations at the restaurants it owned in Russia in March, citing the ""humanitarian crisis"" and ""unpredictable operating environment"" caused by the Ukraine war. The move drew outrage among Russian politicians and prompted threats the business would be seized. A patent application for an ""Uncle Vanya"" restaurant chain was filed with Russian authorities shortly after. The name, the same as the famous work by Russian playwright Anton Chekhov, was one of several brand knock-offs of Western companies to surface. Last year, Russia and Ukraine accounted for about 9% of McDonald's revenue. The move by McDonald's came after French carmaker Renault sold its majority stake in carmaker Aftovaz to a state research institute for a symbolic sum, while its Renault Russia business was taken over by the city of Moscow.

"Sri Lanka has defaulted on its debt for the first time in its history as the country struggles with its worst financial crisis in more than 70 years. A 30-day grace period to come up with $78m (Â£63m) of unpaid debt interest payments expired on Wednesday. The governor of the South Asian nation's central bank said the country was now in a ""pre-emptive default"". Later on Thursday, two of the world's biggest credit rating agencies also said Sri Lanka had defaulted. Defaults happen when governments are unable to meet some or all of their debt payments to creditors. It can damage a country's reputation with investors, making it harder for it to borrow the money it needs on international markets, which can further harm confidence in its currency and economy. Asked on Thursday whether the country was now in default, central bank governor P Nandalal Weerasinghe said: ""Our position is very clear, we said that until they come to the restructure [of our debts], we will not be able to pay. So that's what you call pre-emptive default. ""There can be technical definitions... from their side they can consider it a default. Our position is very clear, until there is a debt restructure, we cannot repay,"" he added. Sri Lanka down to last day of petrol, new PM says What's behind Sri Lanka's economic crisis? Sri Lanka is seeking to restructure debts of more than $50bn it owes to foreign creditors, to make it more manageable to repay. The country's economy has been hit hard by the pandemic and rising energy prices, but critics say the current crisis has been of the previous government's own making. A chronic shortage of foreign currency and soaring inflation have led to a severe shortage of medicines, fuel and other essentials. Professor Mick Moore from the University of Sussex and former consultant on Sri Lanka for the Asian Development Bank said even though it looked like Sri Lanka was struggling from the effects of global economic problems, it was ""emphatically not that"". ""This is the most man-made and voluntary economic crisis of which I know,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. Prof Moore said the previous administration had borrowed money for infrastructure projects and then ""insisted in this very macho fashion"" on repaying mounting the debts, rather than restructuring them with creditors. He said the then government ""went along in this way until about six months ago and basically they had given away virtually all the foreign exchange they could command"". ""This is egregious incompetence,"" he added. Prof Moore said the country faced a ""very critical situation"". In recent weeks, there have been large, sometimes violent, protests against President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and his family due to the growing crisis. The country has already started talks with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) over a bailout and needs to renegotiate its debt agreements with creditors. Later on Thursday, an IMF spokesman said the current talks on a potential loan programme were expected to conclude on Tuesday. Sri Lanka's government has said previously that it needs as much as $4bn this year. Mr Weerasinghe warned that Sri Lanka's already very high rate of inflation was likely to rise further. ""Inflation obviously is around 30%. It will go even [higher], headline inflation will go [up] around 40% in the next couple of months,"" he said. He was speaking after Sri Lanka's central bank held its two key interest rates steady following a seven percentage points rise at its last meeting. The country's main lending rate remained at 14.5%, while the deposit rate was kept at 13.5%. In many ways this wasn't a surprise. The warning sirens of a potential default were already blaring a few weeks ago. But much more than that, on the streets of Sri Lanka, where this crisis is biting, nobody is shocked. As petrol queues run for miles, with fuel being sold on the black market for eye-watering amounts, as lines for handouts of free bread get longer by the day, the island's inability to pay back debts is being painfully felt. In his first interview since taking office last week, the country's Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told me things would get worse before they improve in Sri Lanka, but even he wasn't able to predict just how bad. ""No-one has got all the detailsâ¦ so I will be like a doctor who's opening up the patient for the first time."" Today's default is a depressing diagnosis for a nation facing more economic turmoil, even as talks with the IMF and other nations continue. On Thursday, ratings agency Moody's Investors Service said Sri Lanka had ""defaulted on its international bonds for the first time"". Moody's said it expected the country to eventually reach an agreement over an IMF bailout. ""However, finalising the programme will likely take several months given the need for staff level agreement on both sides, followed by parliamentary approval in Sri Lanka and approval by the IMF's executive board,"" the firm added. Also on Thursday, Fitch Ratings lowered its assessment of Sri Lanka to a ""restricted default"" after a grace period for payments had expired. S&P Global Ratings did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the BBC. Credit ratings are intended to help investors understand the level of risk they face when buying a financial instrument, in this case a country's debt - or sovereign bond. Last month, S&P and Fitchcredit rating agencies warned Sri Lanka was about to default on its debts. This video can not be played PM Ranil Wickramasinghe: ""There won't be a hunger crisis"" Last week, President Rajapaksa's elder brother Mahinda resigned as prime minister after government supporters clashed with protesters. Nine people died and more than 300 were wounded in the violence. On Friday, Sri Lanka's new Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told the BBCthat the economic crisis was ""going to get worse before it gets better"". He also pledged to ensure families would get three meals a day. Appealing to the world for more financial help, he said ""there won't be a hunger crisis, we will find food"". Sri Lanka is an island nation off southern India: It won independence from British rule in 1948. Three ethnic groups - Sinhalese, Tamil and Muslim - make up 99% of the country's 22 million population. One family of brothers has dominated for years: Mahinda Rajapaksa became a hero among the majority Sinhalese in 2009 when his government defeated Tamil separatist rebels after years of bitter and bloody civil war. His brother Gotabaya, who was defence secretary at the time, is now president. Now an economic crisis has led to fury on the streets: Soaring inflation has meant some foods, medication and fuel are in short supply, there are rolling blackouts and ordinary people have taken to the streets in anger with many blaming the Rajapaksa family and their government for the situation.

"UK inflation is at a 40-year high as energy, food and fuel prices soar The chancellor must act now and not wait for the Autumn Budget to help people with the soaring cost of living, say business groups and unions. The Confederation of British Industry said: ""There are some choices about what you do now and what you do later. You have to help the hardest hit now."" Rishi Sunak has said the government will act where it can but said it will not be easy to cut costs for families. UK inflation is at a 40-year high of 9% as energy, food and fuel prices soar. Mr Sunak told the annual CBI dinner on Wednesday evening that the government was ""ready to do more"" to aid households. ""The next few months will be tough,"" he said. ""But where we can act, we will."" The plans will involve ""cutting costs for families"" but also cutting how much government spending outpaces the income from taxes, Mr Sunak said. It is understood that he is considering ways to help people with their energy bills in July or August as well as announcing tax cuts in the Autumn Budget to support businesses. Calls to bring benefit and pension rises forward Sunak warns of tough few months as inflation soars Royal Mail warns it will put prices up again But Tony Danker, director-general of the CBI, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was important to act now. ""Helping people with heating bills and eating bills will not fuel inflation and you need to stimulate business investment now. That's not going to overheat the economy, it is going to make sure that any downturns in our fortunes will be short and shallow because growth is coming soon."" The inflation rate in April reached its highest level since 1982, while recent data showed the UK economy shrank in March, raising concerns the country is heading for a recession. The TUC's Kate Bell urged the government to increase state benefits now as opposed to next April and dismissed claims thatIT issues prevented it from bringing forward the uplift. ""What I think we saw during the coronavirus crisis was when the economy is in trouble or when we're facing an emergency we do need to protect people and that is the best way to protect the economy. ""I think that is what we need to see now and when people hear the government saying 'the computer says no', I think they are pretty clear that is an excuse, we can act if we want to,"" said Ms Bell. Why are prices rising so quickly? â¢When might the inflation rate come down? The Resolution Foundation think tank said that although everyone is affected by rapidly rising food and energy prices, the poorest households are hit hardest, because they have to spend a bigger share of their budgets on essentials than people with more money. ""The scale of the cost-of-living crisis requires urgent action,"" said Jack Leslie, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation. ""Our benefits system is designed to get support out quickly to the low-and-middle income families at the heart of this crisis, and is the obvious way to deliver further support."" Meanwhile, the British Independent Retailers Association (Bira) said that small businesses are facing a ""tsunami"" of cost increases, with energy bills more than doubling, wages going up, ""double digit supply chain inflation"", and ""business rates increased in real terms by 100%"". Andrew Goodacre, the chief executive of Bira, called for the government to look to reduce business rates ""as a matter of urgency"". ""Reducing business rates down to 2021 levels would give Â£6,000 on average to small businesses, and help retailers survive in the autumn, when energy prices are set to rise again,"" Mr Goodacre said. The prices of fuel, energy and food have surged in recent months, driven in part by the Ukraine war. In April, gas and electricity prices had the biggest impact on inflation after a higher energy price cap - which limits what suppliers can charge per unit - kicked in. Homes using a typical amount of gas and electricity are now paying Â£1,971 per year on average, up Â£700 from the previous cap. On Wednesday, Citizens Advice said ""the warning lights could not be flashing brighter"" and the government needed to offer households more support with their energy bills. Boss Dame Clare Moriarty said some people faced ""desperate"" situations, with ""parents skipping meals to feed their kids"" and others ""washing in their kitchen sinks because they can't afford a hot shower"". Meanwhile, petrol and diesel prices hit new records of Â£1.68 and Â£1.81 per litre this week. The RAC said a family car that used diesel now cost nearly Â£100 to fill up. ""While wholesale prices dropped on Wednesday, indicating we may have passed the peak, drivers should brace themselves for further pump price rises as retailers who have had to buy new stock this week pass on their increased costs in the coming days,"" said RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams. ""Drivers badly need further help from the government, particularly as the Treasury is benefitting considerably from the windfall that 20% VAT brings them on these record high prices,"" he added. Opposition parties have been calling for a windfall tax on the profits of big oil and gas firms and for the money to be used to offset energy bills. But on Tuesday Conservative MPs voted down the idea, having argued it could discourage investment.

The culture secretary - who is pushing for the network to be privatised - rejected claims she was seeking vengeance against it as ""laughable"". But she told MPs she would not ""justify a news organisation whose anchor went out to shout obscenities at Tories"" - areference to claims about Jon Snow,external. Ms Dorries also told MPs she shared her Netflix account with others. Speaking to the Commons culture committee, the minister praised the streaming service's ""incredibly generous system"". ""I mean my mum has access to my account. I have Netflix but there are four other people who can use my Netflix account in different parts of the country."" ""Am I not supposed to do that?"" she added with a laugh. What could privatising Channel 4 mean? Dorries: Tough times that shaped my political life How much is the BBC licence fee and why is it under threat? Netflix has previously said users sharing their passwords with others was ""something you have to learn to live with"". However, following a fall in subscribers,the company has suggestedit wants to crack down on the practice. The culture secretary also defended her decision to privatise Channel 4, arguing it would prevent the network from being too reliant on revenues from advertising. Pressed on why she had not recently appeared on the broadcaster's evening news show, she said she got on ""really well"" with Cathy Newman, one of the presenters, but that invitations to appear often came at ""really short notice"". She said the programme was ""edgy"", but added: ""I'm not going to justify a news programme whose new anchor went out shouting obscenities about the Conservative Party. ""So they didn't do themselves any favours sometimes on the news programme and I think that is probably as much as I want to say about that."" Channel 4 stars including Derry Girls' Saoirse-Monica Jackson has spoken out against privatisation In 2017, Conservative MPs attacked the programme's presenter Jon Snow, after a claim he shouted obscenities about Conservatives - although Mr Snow said he did not have any recollection of the incident. But Ms Dorries, said it was ""laughable"" when asked if selling Channel 4 was ""vengeance"" for its news coverage. Channel 4 News editor Esme Wren said the network's output was ""internationally-renowned for the depth and quality of its coverage ranging"". ""Since the start of 2022, Channel 4 News has seen the biggest increase in audience share across all the public service broadcasting national main news programmes and is up by 43% among younger viewers aged 16-34 year-on-year."" Channel 4 has objected to the government's privatisation plans, saying it was ""disappointing"" that ministers had made their decision despite ""significant public interest concerns"". Ms Dorries insisted the move would allow Channel 4 to raise investment and that it was ""a great time to sell"". Chief executive Alex Mahon said privatisation would ""make a negative impact on the creative industries across the UK"". During the committee hearing, Ms Dorries also told MPs a review of how the BBC is funded would start before Parliament's summer recess at the end of July. This video can not be played Damian Green asks if the BBC funding review is a ""shamâ as Nadine Dorries has ""already come to a very firm conclusion"". The minister told MPs she was looking for an independent chair to lead the review and would be ""completely hands-off"". Asked whether she personally still wanted to abolish the licence fee, Ms Dorries replied: ""Yes, the licence fee is an unfair way of funding the BBC."" Conservative MP Damian Green asked the minister if, given she had made up her mind, the consultation was ""a sham"".

"""It's devastating. The amount of time and effort you put in your home and then to see it go under water."" Sam Bowstead is an architect who specialises in preparing houses to withstand natural disasters. But when floods engulfed his Brisbane home in February, he felt helpless. ""I've worked with people who've been in similar situations - now this happened to me,"" he says. ""I was shocked at how fast [the water] rose... more than a metre in a couple of hours. I went from being worried about our property to being worried about our safety."" In the end, a boat was the only way out. Mr Bowstead's experience has become increasingly common for Australians. In the past three years, record-breaking bushfire and flood events have killed more than 500 people and billions of animals. Drought, cyclones and freak tides have gripped communities. Climate change is a key concern for voters in Australia's election on Saturday. So is the cost of living - and these issues are converging like never before. Australia is facing an ""insurability crisis"" with one in 25 homes on track to be effectively uninsurable by 2030, according to a Climate Council report. Another one in 11 are at risk of being underinsured. Insurance for the highest-risk homes will be prohibitively expensive or refused by providers, says the Climate Council, which createdan interactive map for Australians to search. ""Climate change is playing out in real time here and many Australians now find it impossible to insure their homes and businesses,"" says chief executive Amanda McKenzie. Nowhere is this a bigger issue than in Queensland. It is home to almost 40% of the 500,000 homes projected to be effectively uninsurable. Queensland has been ravaged by floods in recent months. In February, the state capital Brisbane had more than 70% of its average yearly rainfall in just three days. ""I still feel quite traumatised when it rains heavily,"" says Michelle Vine, whose East Brisbane home was destroyed along with decades of her artwork. ""We had to move out of the home - it became unliveable."" Insurers say the floods - which also battered New South Wales - will become Australia's most expensive flood event ever. But even before this year, insurance costs were skyrocketing. Though rising property prices are one factor, Australia's peak insurance industry body points the finger at climate change. The Insurance Council of Australia says no parts of the country are currently uninsurable but there are ""clearly affordability and availability concerns"". Over the past decade, the amount paid out by insurers on damage claims from natural disasters has roughly doubled. On average, consumers now pay almost four times for home insurance premiums than in 2004. In northern Australia, these numbers are even more extreme - in some cases 10 times higher than elsewhere. More Australians are being forced to underinsure - purchase cheaper policies that cover too little - or forgo insurance altogether. ""This is probably Australia's most important cost-of-living issue,"" Dr Antonia Settle, a political economist at the University of Melbourne, tells the BBC. ""Households that don't have insurance risk losing their most important asset."" The phenomenon could also exacerbate social inequality and create ""climate ghettos"", says Climate Valuation, a risk analysis company. Properties in higher-risk areas are becoming cheaper to buy and rent, often attracting people who are least able to afford adequate insurance, compounding the financial impact of disasters. ""People are not moving away from climate-endangered places in Australia. And in fact, along the fringes of the major cities, they are more likely to move toward them,"" says demographer Liz Allen from the Australian National University. ""The housing affordability issue in Australia is so dire… that people see climate catastrophe as almost a bargain, a way to ensure that they can have a place to call their own."" Ms Vine is one example of this - saying she was drawn to a vulnerable area by price. At the time, she felt like she'd ""won the lottery"". Mr Bowstead made a similar choice, describing it as ""a Catch-22... for young people"". And once in a risky area, it's near impossible for many to get out - as is the case for Gary Godley in the town of Grantham, west of Brisbane. Given Grantham's horrific flood history - 12 people died there in 2011 - there are no takers for his home. ""We want out. We just can't afford it,"" Mr Godley says. ""We can't do anything."" The government has promised billions to help ""reinsure"" insurers against major claims resulting from disasters, arguing it will essentially halve premiums for people in northern Australia. But it is a risky policy, and not one either the Insurance Council of Australia or the country's industry watchdog wanted. Critics have pointed out that disasters are now frequently devastating areas outside northern Australia that won't be covered by the policy. What about their premiums? They're instead calling for the government to limit development in high-risk areas, consider buying out some homeowners, or create incentives for people to make their properties disaster-resilient. But the obvious answer is addressing climate change, Dr Settle says - though this is something successive governments have been reluctant to do. After massive bushfires in 2019-20,Australians were warned to preparefor an ""alarming"" future of simultaneous and worsening disasters. Yet for a nation so exposed to climate change, Australia remains one of the world's biggest emitters per head of population. Prime Minister Scott Morrison's government has promised to reduce emissions by 26% by 2030. Labor, under Anthony Albanese, has pledged a 43% cut. Both are below the 50% recommended by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Most Australians want tougher climate action, but both parties have kept fairly quiet on the topic during this election campaign. In the town of Gladstone - which lies in a marginal seat in central Queensland - the reason for this avoidance is clear. Coal is an integral part of Gladstone. It's shipped from the local port and has helped Australia become the second-largest exporter globally and created thousands of jobs. Phil Golby, a local Australian Manufacturing Workers' Union official, says ""change is inevitable"" but fears fossil fuel workers will be left behind. ""I've heard a lot of talk. I've listened to a lot of presentations - but I haven't really seen a direct path yet,"" Mr Golby says. ""If a new industry comes [to Gladstone] we need to make sure that we're going to get our workforce trained… [and] it's got to replace their pay. We can't start to see people going backwards."" Essentially, coal lies in that impossible place between Australia's prosperity, politics, and environmental perils. So phasing out fossil fuels is a politically toxic issue that no big party wants to tackle head-on, especially not during an election. That frustrates Mr Bowstead. For him and so many young people there's a real anxiety about what climate change will mean for how and where they'll live in the future. ""[It's] not going to happen - this is happening already,"" he says. ""It feels like we're going to have to take responsibility and bear the brunt of that for much longer than most of those people who are in power now.""

"UK inflation is at a 40-year high as energy, food and fuel prices soar The chancellor must act now and not wait for the Autumn Budget to help people with the soaring cost of living, say business groups and unions. The Confederation of British Industry said: ""There are some choices about what you do now and what you do later. You have to help the hardest hit now."" Rishi Sunak has said the government will act where it can but said it will not be easy to cut costs for families. UK inflation is at a 40-year high of 9% as energy, food and fuel prices soar. Mr Sunak told the annual CBI dinner on Wednesday evening that the government was ""ready to do more"" to aid households. ""The next few months will be tough,"" he said. ""But where we can act, we will."" The plans will involve ""cutting costs for families"" but also cutting how much government spending outpaces the income from taxes, Mr Sunak said. It is understood that he is considering ways to help people with their energy bills in July or August as well as announcing tax cuts in the Autumn Budget to support businesses. Calls to bring benefit and pension rises forward Sunak warns of tough few months as inflation soars Royal Mail warns it will put prices up again But Tony Danker, director-general of the CBI, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was important to act now. ""Helping people with heating bills and eating bills will not fuel inflation and you need to stimulate business investment now. That's not going to overheat the economy, it is going to make sure that any downturns in our fortunes will be short and shallow because growth is coming soon."" The inflation rate in April reached its highest level since 1982, while recent data showed the UK economy shrank in March, raising concerns the country is heading for a recession. The TUC's Kate Bell urged the government to increase state benefits now as opposed to next April and dismissed claims thatIT issues prevented it from bringing forward the uplift. ""What I think we saw during the coronavirus crisis was when the economy is in trouble or when we're facing an emergency we do need to protect people and that is the best way to protect the economy. ""I think that is what we need to see now and when people hear the government saying 'the computer says no', I think they are pretty clear that is an excuse, we can act if we want to,"" said Ms Bell. Why are prices rising so quickly? â¢When might the inflation rate come down? The Resolution Foundation think tank said that although everyone is affected by rapidly rising food and energy prices, the poorest households are hit hardest, because they have to spend a bigger share of their budgets on essentials than people with more money. ""The scale of the cost-of-living crisis requires urgent action,"" said Jack Leslie, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation. ""Our benefits system is designed to get support out quickly to the low-and-middle income families at the heart of this crisis, and is the obvious way to deliver further support."" Meanwhile, the British Independent Retailers Association (Bira) said that small businesses are facing a ""tsunami"" of cost increases, with energy bills more than doubling, wages going up, ""double digit supply chain inflation"", and ""business rates increased in real terms by 100%"". Andrew Goodacre, the chief executive of Bira, called for the government to look to reduce business rates ""as a matter of urgency"". ""Reducing business rates down to 2021 levels would give Â£6,000 on average to small businesses, and help retailers survive in the autumn, when energy prices are set to rise again,"" Mr Goodacre said. The prices of fuel, energy and food have surged in recent months, driven in part by the Ukraine war. In April, gas and electricity prices had the biggest impact on inflation after a higher energy price cap - which limits what suppliers can charge per unit - kicked in. Homes using a typical amount of gas and electricity are now paying Â£1,971 per year on average, up Â£700 from the previous cap. On Wednesday, Citizens Advice said ""the warning lights could not be flashing brighter"" and the government needed to offer households more support with their energy bills. Boss Dame Clare Moriarty said some people faced ""desperate"" situations, with ""parents skipping meals to feed their kids"" and others ""washing in their kitchen sinks because they can't afford a hot shower"". Meanwhile, petrol and diesel prices hit new records of Â£1.68 and Â£1.81 per litre this week. The RAC said a family car that used diesel now cost nearly Â£100 to fill up. ""While wholesale prices dropped on Wednesday, indicating we may have passed the peak, drivers should brace themselves for further pump price rises as retailers who have had to buy new stock this week pass on their increased costs in the coming days,"" said RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams. ""Drivers badly need further help from the government, particularly as the Treasury is benefitting considerably from the windfall that 20% VAT brings them on these record high prices,"" he added. Opposition parties have been calling for a windfall tax on the profits of big oil and gas firms and for the money to be used to offset energy bills. But on Tuesday Conservative MPs voted down the idea, having argued it could discourage investment.

"The prices of parcels and stamps are likely to rise again as Royal Mail tries to cover higher costs, including wages, energy and fuel expenses. The firm said it would try to ""mitigate"" the costs through ""price increases and growth initiatives"". Earlier this year, the firm hiked first class stamp prices by 10p to 95p and second class stamps by 2p to 68p. The warning comes after Royal Mail warned it was facing ""significant headwinds"" from rising costs. It said it will need to cut costs more as a result, increasing its target to over Â£350m from Â£290m previously. A spokeswoman said: ""We haven't made decisions on future prices, but we always carefully consider the impact on our customers and ensure that any changes help to secure the sustainability of the Universal Service."" Royal Mail said it was also continuing to change the business to cope better as its parcel business becomes more important than letter delivery. Letter volumes have fallen by more than 60% since their peak in 2004-05 and by about 20% since the pandemic began. Meanwhile, parcel deliveries increased during the pandemic. Simon Thompson, chief executive of Royal Mail, said: ""As we emerge from the pandemic, the need to accelerate the transformation of our business, particularly in delivery, has become more urgent. ""Our future is as a parcels business, so we need to adapt old ways of working designed for letters and do it much more quickly to a world increasingly dominated by parcels."" Royal Mail wants fleet of 500 drones to carry mail New stamps released to honour the Spitfire Women Royal Mail to cut jobs amid ongoing postal delays Mr Thompson said that the focus would now be to ""work at pace"" with staff and trade unions to ""reinvent this British icon for the next generations"",  give customers ""what they want"" grow the business sustainably and ""deliver long-term job security"". The price hike warning came as the business reported an 8.8% drop in pre-tax profit to Â£662m for the year to the end of March. Royal Mail is also facing an ongoing pay dispute with its largest labour union. In January it said around 700 management roles would be cut. The company also axed a fifth of its managers - around 2,000 posts - in June 2020, shortly after the start of the pandemic. Earlier this year the company was heavily criticised for delivery disruptions over Christmas and January. Citizens Advice estimated that 2.5 million Royal Mail customers didn't receive important documents such as health appointments, fines or bills. Royal Mail said the wave of Omicron infections meant that thousands of staff members had to take time off over Christmas and January. But it said the ""vast majority"" of post was delivered on time.

"Female presenters - faces uncovered - have become common on screen in recent years The Taliban have ordered female Afghan TV presenters and other women on screen to cover their faces while on air. Media outlets were told of the decree on Wednesday, a religious police spokesman told BBC Pashto. The ruling comes two weeks after all women wereordered to wear a face veil in public, or risk punishment. Restrictions are being tightened on women - they are banned from travelling without a male guardian and secondary schools are shut for girls. One female Afghan journalist working for a local TV station in Kabul, who did not want to be named, said she'd been shocked to hear the latest news. ""They are putting indirect pressure on us to stop us presenting on TV,"" she told the BBC. ""How can I read the news with my mouth covered? I don't know what to do now - I must work, I am the breadwinner of my family.""The new decree will take effect from 21 May, Reuters news agency reported, quoting a spokesman for the Taliban's Ministry for the Prevention of Vice and Promotion of Virtue.

During their first stint in power in the 1990s the Taliban forced women to wear the all-encompassing burka in public. The hardline Islamist movement was driven from power by US-led troops in 2001, after which many restrictions eased. Women appearing on television showing their faces became a common sight. Who are the Taliban? After retaking power last August, following the withdrawal of foreign forces, the Taliban had held off issuing new laws on what women should wear. This raised hopes they would govern Afghanistan, a deeply conservative and patriarchal country, more flexibly this time. The burka was enforced by the Taliban in the 1990s and still worn by many women Many women still wore the burka, but in bigger cities it was also common to see women continuing to wear headscarves. However in early May the Ministry for the Prevention of Vice and Promotion of Virtue announced that all women would have to cover their face in public, and indicated that a burka would be the ideal garment to achieve this. Anyone refusing to comply with the ruling risks an escalating series of punishments. Most Muslims around the world do not consider women covering their face mandatory, or oppose them working. Women are still employed in some jobs in Afghanistan, such as healthcare and education, but many others have been told not to return to work now the Taliban are back in power. The country has been plunged into economic crisis and famine under Taliban rule. Western diplomats have indicated that resuming development funding and unlocking frozen cash depends on better treatment of women. But early hopes the Taliban might relax their approach have been eroded amid signs influential hardliners in the group have the upper hand. The journalist in Kabul who spoke to the BBC wanted the international community to put pressure on the Taliban. ""They should tell them you have 10 days to change otherwise we are going to cut off relations and aid."" She said she believed the Taliban planned to stop women doing all kinds of work outside their homes. ""They want women to live like prisoners at home.

"The UN says around 20 million tonnes of grain are currently stuck in Ukraine from the previous harvest Russia's invasion of Ukraine could soon cause a global food crisis that may last for years, the UN has warned. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the war had worsened food insecurity in poorer nations due to rising prices. Some countries could face long-term famines if Ukraine's exports are not restored to pre-war levels, he added. The conflict has cut off supplies from Ukraine's ports, which once exported vast amounts of cooking oil as well as cereals such as maize and wheat. This has reduced the global supply and caused the price of alternatives to soar. Global food prices are almost 30% higher than the same time last year, according to the UN. Speaking in New York on Wednesday, Mr Guterres said the conflict - combined with the effects of climate change and the pandemic - ""threatens to tip tens of millions of people over the edge into food insecurity followed by malnutrition, mass hunger and famine"". ""There is enough food in our world now if we act together. But unless we solve this problem today, we face the spectre of global food shortage in the coming months,"" he added. He warned that the only effective solution to the crisis was reintegrating Ukraine's food production, as well as fertiliser produced by both Russia and Belarus, back into the global market. MILITARY:Retired colonel speaks out on Russian TV MARIUPOL:'I hid below ground at steelworks for 60 days' ANALYSIS:The spy war within the war READ MORE:Full coverage of the crisis,external Mr Guterres also said he was in ""intense contact"" with Russia and Ukraine, as well as the US and the EU, in an effort to restore food exports to normal levels. ""The complex security, economic and financial implications require goodwill on all sides,"" he said. His comments came on the same day the World Bank announced extra funding worth $12bn (Â£9.7bn) for projects addressing food insecurity. The move will bring the total amount available for such projects to more than $30bn over the next 15 months. Russia and Ukraine produce 30% of the world's wheat supply and - prior to the war - Ukraine was seen as the world's bread basket, exporting 4.5 million tonnes of agricultural produce per month through its ports. But since Russia launched its invasion in February, exports have collapsed and prices have skyrocketed. They climbed even further after India banned wheat exports on Saturday. The UN says around 20 million tonnes of grain are currently stuck in Ukraine from the previous harvest which, if released, could ease pressure on global markets. This video can not be played Watch: Ros Atkins on why the war in Ukraine is pushing up food prices - and the likely impact on poorer countries While the number of people facing food insecurity had been growing even before the invasion, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, accused Moscow of making a difficult situation even worse on Wednesday.

""It is doing so at a time when millions are already being threatened by hunger, particularly in the Middle East and Africa.""

During their first stint in power in the 1990s the Taliban forced women to wear the all-encompassing burka in public. The hardline Islamist movement was driven from power by US-led troops in 2001, after which many restrictions eased. Women appearing on television showing their faces became a common sight. Who are the Taliban? After retaking power last August, following the withdrawal of foreign forces, the Taliban had held off issuing new laws on what women should wear. This raised hopes they would govern Afghanistan, a deeply conservative and patriarchal country, more flexibly this time. The burka was enforced by the Taliban in the 1990s and still worn by many women Many women still wore the burka, but in bigger cities it was also common to see women continuing to wear headscarves. However in early May the Ministry for the Prevention of Vice and Promotion of Virtue announced that all women would have to cover their face in public, and indicated that a burka would be the ideal garment to achieve this. Anyone refusing to comply with the ruling risks an escalating series of punishments. Most Muslims around the world do not consider women covering their face mandatory, or oppose them working. Women are still employed in some jobs in Afghanistan, such as healthcare and education, but many others have been told not to return to work now the Taliban are back in power. The country has been plunged into economic crisis and famine under Taliban rule. Western diplomats have indicated that resuming development funding and unlocking frozen cash depends on better treatment of women. But early hopes the Taliban might relax their approach have been eroded amid signs influential hardliners in the group have the upper hand. The journalist in Kabul who spoke to the BBC wanted the international community to put pressure on the Taliban. ""They should tell them you have 10 days to change otherwise we are going to cut off relations and aid."" She said she believed the Taliban planned to stop women doing all kinds of work outside their homes. ""They want women to live like prisoners at home. Every day they issued decrees against us - I don't think we can survive.""

"The UN says around 20 million tonnes of grain are currently stuck in Ukraine from the previous harvest Russia's invasion of Ukraine could soon cause a global food crisis that may last for years, the UN has warned. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the war had worsened food insecurity in poorer nations due to rising prices. Some countries could face long-term famines if Ukraine's exports are not restored to pre-war levels, he added. The conflict has cut off supplies from Ukraine's ports, which once exported vast amounts of cooking oil as well as cereals such as maize and wheat. This has reduced the global supply and caused the price of alternatives to soar. Global food prices are almost 30% higher than the same time last year, according to the UN. Speaking in New York on Wednesday, Mr Guterres said the conflict - combined with the effects of climate change and the pandemic - ""threatens to tip tens of millions of people over the edge into food insecurity followed by malnutrition, mass hunger and famine"". ""There is enough food in our world now if we act together. But unless we solve this problem today, we face the spectre of global food shortage in the coming months,"" he added. He warned that the only effective solution to the crisis was reintegrating Ukraine's food production, as well as fertiliser produced by both Russia and Belarus, back into the global market. MILITARY:Retired colonel speaks out on Russian TV MARIUPOL:'I hid below ground at steelworks for 60 days' ANALYSIS:The spy war within the war READ MORE:Full coverage of the crisis,external Mr Guterres also said he was in ""intense contact"" with Russia and Ukraine, as well as the US and the EU, in an effort to restore food exports to normal levels. ""The complex security, economic and financial implications require goodwill on all sides,"" he said. His comments came on the same day the World Bank announced extra funding worth $12bn (Â£9.7bn) for projects addressing food insecurity. The move will bring the total amount available for such projects to more than $30bn over the next 15 months. Russia and Ukraine produce 30% of the world's wheat supply and - prior to the war - Ukraine was seen as the world's bread basket, exporting 4.5 million tonnes of agricultural produce per month through its ports. But since Russia launched its invasion in February, exports have collapsed and prices have skyrocketed. They climbed even further after India banned wheat exports on Saturday.

"Opposition parties have warned that temporary cuts to about 700 ScotRail services will be devastating for many passengers and businesses. The temporary timetable will be brought in next Monday because of a driver shortage caused by a pay dispute between ScotRail and the Aslef union. It will see the last train on many routes departing before 20:00. Nicola Sturgeon has said the timetable will get back to normal ""as quickly as possible"". ScotRail plans to cut third of services - union Train driver shortage causes wave of cancellations ScotRail goes back into public ownership ScotRail was nationalised by the Scottish government last month after the previous operator, Abellio, had its franchise ended early amid criticism of the quality of the service. Its May 2022 timetable had approximately 2,150 weekday services, but from next week this will be reduced temporarily by a third to 1,456. Hundreds of trains have been cancelled since 8 May when many drivers opted not to work overtime. Drivers' union Aslef had balloted members for strike action after rejecting a 2.2% pay offer. Similar cuts are expected to be made to the Saturday and Sunday timetables with details due to be made public in the coming days. Duringfirst minister's questions at Holyrood, Ms Sturgeon said it was vital to get rail services back to normal as quickly as possible, with the timetable to be formally reviewed on 3 June. But she said an agreement on fair pay would need to be reached with rail workers before the timetable could be reinstated. Additional drivers were also being trained up, she added. ""I expect ScotRail to make sure that this temporary timetable is just that - temporary - and the timetable gets back to normal as quickly as possible,"" she said. Ms Sturgeon also urged Aslef and ScotRail to continue negotiations to reach a settlement. She said: ""I would say to the unions that I understand their job is to represent their members and to get a fair pay deal for members, but let's see both parties get round the table and negotiate that in good faith - I think that's what the travelling public want to see as well."" Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said passengers were now paying more than ever in fares and getting the worst service seen for a generation. He also said the reduced timetable would have a profound impact on businesses as well as passengers. Mr Ross said: ""Last month, the first minister proclaimed that nationalising ScotRail was a new beginning that would deliver a railway for the nation. ""But after just seven weeks, nationalisation is already proving a disaster. As with the ferries, as soon as this government steps into sort things out, the problems get even worse. ""These cuts will also be devastating for businesses still reeling from the impact of the Covid pandemic. They are facing another lost summer."" Anas Sarwar, Scottish Labour's leader, said the first minister had overseen the biggest cuts to Scotland's railways in over half a century. Transport Minister Jenny Gilruth later told BBC Scotland'sThe Nineshe expected 38 new drivers to complete their training by the end of the summer, 55 by the end of the year, and 100 by June 2023. She said she would meet Scotrail representatives on Friday. Daily services have not yet returned to pre-pandemic levels Among the angry passengers to contact the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme was Aaron, from Fife, who said the first train he will be able to get to Edinburgh will be half an hour later than normal from Monday. He said: ""The 07:01 is the first train to Edinburgh, the next one is 08:03. This will affect people's childcare and ability to go into the office."" The last train home to Dalmeny will now be at 19:20. The brewery worker added: ""It's two-pronged for hospitality. Businesses will lose the revenue from people who won't go out, or take their cars and don't drink, and they will find it harder to employ people to work late."" Meanwhile, club and venue owner Donald MacLeod said train services being being cut would ""cripple"" the fragile recovery of hospitality after the Covid pandemic. The Night Time Industries Association Scotland described the cuts as devastating, adding that it was ""another cruel blow"" for the hard-pressed sector. Its statement added: ""The Scottish government must urgently resolve this dispute or they will be putting at risk both Scotland's economic recovery and the future of many thousands of small businesses and jobs."" ScotRail's David Simpson said how long the temporary timetable remained would depend on talks with the union, but admitted that it could be in place for several weeks. He said: ""I'd hope temporary means as short as possible but it does depend on making some progress with the pay talks which are the root cause of this problem. ""We're trying to minimise the impact of this by making the service more predictable to customers and we plan to leave this timetable in place until we make any progress in the pay talks."" He added that the pandemic had had an impact on the driver training programme. Meanwhile, the Aslef union accused the Scottish government of ""industrial vandalism"" over the cuts. Kevin Lindsay, Aslef Scotland organiser, said: ""This is what happens when you have political interference in industrial relations. ""It's time the Scottish government allowed ScotRail and Aslef to negotiate in a fair and open manner. ""These cuts will have a devastating effect on passengers and their confidence in our railway."" A Transport Scotland spokesman said: ""The difficult decision to revise the service timetable was made because of the level of disruption caused over the last two weekends by many drivers choosing not to work their rest days. ""That is of course their right and we respect that. Many of them are clearly prioritising family and leisure time over the financial benefits that come from such working."" He said ScotRail would have a full complement of drivers fully trained by October, reducing the need for drivers to work rest days.

"Marks & Spencer has written to the chancellor warning that an online sales tax would damage the High Street. A three-month government consultation on whether to introduce an online sales tax closes on Friday. The Treasury said the proceeds would go towards funding a reduction in business rates for shops. But M&S believes a new online tax would ""punish"" the very retailers it plans to support and leave them less money to invest in High Street stores. The chain's chief financial officer, Eoin Tonge, argued in excerpts seen by the BBC that traditional retailers have worked hard to diversify and grow their online sales. He said an additional tax burden would make it harder for them to invest in what is needed to survive and grow in the modern, digital era. Tesco tells chancellor to hit online rivals with sales tax ""Introducing an additional tax on retail - already overburdened - will simply mean retailers cut their cloth accordingly,"" he said. ""This rationalisation will always start with the least profitable parts of a business - which, in the case of multi-channel retailers, will more often than not be High Street stores,"" said Mr Tonge. ""Therefore it is likely that, far from helping the High Street an online sales tax will damage shops and our high streets further, particularly in areas that require new investment to bring them back to life."" The Treasury has been sounding out the retail industry on anonline sales tax since February,externalsaying it is keen to hear the arguments for and against, as well as how it could work. It said no decision has been made. High Street retailers have been complaining for years about the soaring cost of business rates, a property based tax. They tend to pay far higher rates than online rivals who do not have stores to run. They want a complete overhaul of the system, which they say is no longer fit for purpose, threatening the economic viability of shops. Despite widespread calls for a revamp, the Treasury decided last year there was no case for fundamental change. The tax raises roughly Â£25bn a year. The government said it was reducing the rates burden by some Â£7bn this year to support the High Street. But it promised to look at an online tax. According to the consultation document, an online sales tax of 1% could raise about a billion pounds per year to help reduce business rates in England. The issue is complicated, however, and retailers are divided on the idea. For a start, there are questions over which goods should it cover, and whether it should be done as a proportion of a retailer's sales or a flat fee. Then there is the issue of what counts as an online sale. Many people, for instance, order via the internet and then collect in store. Some of Britain's biggest retailers, including Tesco, Sainsbury's, Gregg's and Morrisons, recently joined forces to launch a ""Cut the Shops Tax Campaign"" urging the government to reduce business rates to help mitigate rising costs and keep shops open. They also said they'd be ""open"" to an online sales tax if it funded a reduction in rates to help create more of a level playing field. The debate over how best to tax this sector has become even more intense during the pandemic, said KPMG's UK head of retail, Paul Martin. ""The way we shop has evolved significantly over the last two years with online channels growing the fastest. This has resulted in the need to reconsider how the sector is taxed, with the historic focus on bricks and mortar not timely anymore,"" he said. He believes the future for retailers involves having both online and physical stores in a completely integrated model. Therefore the idea of having separate taxes is not likely to solve the problems. Right now all of the UK's big High Street retailers want the pressure to ease on business rates. The government will soon have to decide if an online sales tax is the right way to do it.

According to the consultation document, an online sales tax of 1% could raise about a billion pounds per year to help reduce business rates in England. The issue is complicated, however, and retailers are divided on the idea. For a start, there are questions over which goods should it cover, and whether it should be done as a proportion of a retailer's sales or a flat fee. Then there is the issue of what counts as an online sale. Many people, for instance, order via the internet and then collect in store. Some of Britain's biggest retailers, including Tesco, Sainsbury's, Gregg's and Morrisons, recently joined forces to launch a ""Cut the Shops Tax Campaign"" urging the government to reduce business rates to help mitigate rising costs and keep shops open. They also said they'd be ""open"" to an online sales tax if it funded a reduction in rates to help create more of a level playing field. The debate over how best to tax this sector has become even more intense during the pandemic, said KPMG's UK head of retail, Paul Martin. ""The way we shop has evolved significantly over the last two years with online channels growing the fastest. This has resulted in the need to reconsider how the sector is taxed, with the historic focus on bricks and mortar not timely anymore,"" he said. He believes the future for retailers involves having both online and physical stores in a completely integrated model. Therefore the idea of having separate taxes is not likely to solve the problems. Right now all of the UK's big High Street retailers want the pressure to ease on business rates. The government will soon have to decide if an online sales tax is the right way to do it.

"The UK government failed in its duty of care to protect doctors and the wider healthcare workforce at the start of the pandemic, a doctors' union says. The British Medical Association review said staff were desperately let down by the lack of protective equipment. And they were still suffering the physical and mental health impacts, having seen levels of illness and death ""they were never trained for"". The government said lessons would be learned but defended its record on PPE. The BMA criticisms, based on feedback and testimonies from the union's members, will form part of its submission to the official public inquiry into the pandemic. Although healthcare is a devolved political issue, the UK government took on the role of making deals with PPE suppliers in order to supply equipment that was distributed across all four nations of the UK. One million NHS masks fail high-grade safety tests Doctors told the BMA that, during the early months of the pandemic, there were times they had to buy or make their own masks. And some reported being left with long-term health problems from Covid infections. One junior medic, in Scotland, said they remained bedbound, after being infected in March 2020. ""My life as I knew it had ended,"" the medic said. Many doctors said they had felt pressured to work in hazardous situations, with inadequate risk assessments. The review also highlighted how doctors with an ethnic minority background had been more likely to die with Covid, in the early stages of the pandemic, than their white peers. Overall, Office for National Statistics data shows that, throughout 2020, doctors were no more likely than the general working-age population to die with Covid. But nurses and care workers were at higher risk - although, it is unclear how much that was related to exposure at work rather than other factors. The BMA, which has been critical of the government's response to the pandemic throughout, said the UK should have been better prepared and the problems had been made worse by the ""savage"" cuts to the public-health budget in the years before. BMA leader Dr Chaand Nagpaul said: ""A moral duty of government is to protect its own healthcare workers from harm in the course of duty as they serve and protect the nation's health. ""Yet, in reality, doctors were desperately let down by the UK government's failure to adequately prepare."" A government spokeswoman said enough PPE had been bought, in a ""very competitive global market"", to keep staff safe and mental health hubs had been set up to help them cope with trauma. But she added: ""We are committed to learning lessons from the Covid pandemic and will respond openly and transparently to the Inquiry and fully consider all recommendations made.""

"Too many young people have died from eating disorders when their lives could have been saved with early treatment and help, psychiatrists say. New guidance, for all healthcare professionals across the UK sets out how to spot the signs of those at risk and how to best care for them. Hospital admissions for people with eating disorders have risen by 84% over the past five years in England. Charities said they were very concerned about the impact on all age groups. The Royal College of Psychiatrists' medical emergencies in eating disorders guidance,externalsays all healthcare professionals, no matter where they work, are increasingly likely to come into contact with someone with a severe eating disorder who needs urgent care. The Covid pandemichas made an already growing problem of eating disorders in young people even worse,with mental health charities saying lockdown, in particular, had a devastating impact on the most vulnerable. The latest NHS figures,externalshow there were 24,268 hospital admissions for eating disorders in England in 2020-21 - up from 13,219 in 2015-16 - with the biggest increases in those aged 18 and under. The large majority of those affected are young women, but admissions in young men have more than doubled in that time. James was admitted to hospital more than 20 times as a result of his eating disorders James Downs, 32, developed anorexia when he was 15 after experiencing a number of mental health problems - but it was nearly seven years before he saw an eating disorder specialist, because there were none where he lived in south Wales. ""Nobody had the specialist skills to help me,"" he says. When James ended up in hospital on a general ward, staff would openly tell him that nobody knew what to do. ""I was already in a crisis and very scared, but hearing that made me feel even more fear,"" James says. ""If they were panicking, it was quite terrifying for me."" James's health deteriorated over many years and, despite looking fit and well, he was admitted to hospital more than 20 times. Often this was with dangerously low potassium levels or heart issues - both consequences of malnutrition. ""It shouldn't have to get to that,"" he says. Health professionals frequently didn't know what language to use around eating disorders and would often trivialise his problems. And he found navigating the healthcare system while being forced to repeat his story to countless different people ""tiring and really difficult"". ""It comes down to training and awareness. Getting help early could prevent so many people from being admitted to hospital. ""We need informed care, not negative experiences."" Even when seriously unwell, people with eating disorders can appear to be healthy. To help recognise those at risk, the guidance contains practical tools and treatment advice for everyone from nurses to physios, A&E doctors, GPs and dietitians, as well as carers and patients. Psychiatrists started updating the guidance in 2019 after the ""tragic cases"" of three young people came to light, including19-year-old Averil Hart, who died from anorexia in 2012 after collapsing at her university flat. Dr Dasha Nicholls, an eating disorders psychiatrist for children and young people who led work on the guidelines, said eating disorders such as anorexia, bulimia and binge eating can affect people of any age and gender, and are not a lifestyle choice. ""They are mental health disorders, and we shouldn't underestimate how serious they are. ""Even though anorexia nervosa is often referred to as the deadliest mental health condition - most deaths are preventable with early treatment and support,"" she said. The new guidance must reach healthcare professionals urgently, Dr Nicholls said, if the eating disorders epidemic is to be stopped ""in its tracks"". Tom Quinn, from eating disorder charity Beat, said he hoped the guidance would ""make a huge difference"" because the sooner someone gets help, the better their chances of avoiding hospital admission and making a full recovery. But he said he was ""very concerned"" about the rise in hospital admissions for eating disorders across all age groups. He said the pandemic had had a huge impact on services that were already under strain. ""Front-line staff have been working tirelessly to support as many people as possible, but they cannot do so without adequate staffing and funding, which the government must make a priority,"" he said. The Department of Health and Social Care in England said it was investing Â£53m in children and young people's eating disorder services - to increase capacity in 70 community support teams across the country. It said a further Â£79m was being invested in children's mental health services so that at least 2,000 more children and young people can access eating disorder services.

"Sue Miller says her daughter Lowri was ""failed miserably"" by the mental health service A bereaved mother said her daughter was ""failed miserably"" by a mental health service now under review by inspectors. Sue Miller feels Lowri, 32, should not have been discharged from the Royal Glamorgan Hospital in Rhondda Cynon Taf. She died the next day. Healthcare Inspectorate Wales (HIW) is reviewing the mental health service in Cwm Taf Morgannwg Health Board over concerns about discharges. The health board said it would ""take on board"" any HIW recommendations. Health board 'failed' teen who took her own life 'I haven't had any mental health care for 18 months' Mental health sanctuaries urged for young Lowri died from a ""sudden cardiac event"" at a friend's house after taking a mixture of drugs. An inquest found doctors were unaware she had a plan to end her life when she was discharged. Coroner Graeme Hughes recorded a narrative verdict, saying he could not be convinced Lowri had intended to end her life and that ""there was no contribution to her death arising from the clinical decision to discharge her."" Lowri's family said they were disappointed with that conclusion and believe there were failings in her care. The inquest heard Lowri had told her social worker she ""did not want to be alive anymore"" and had a plan to end her life. But those concerns were not relayed to the unit's clinical director before the discharge decision was made, despite the social worker telling a member of the nursing team. Lowri was discharged days after taking an overdose while in the mental health unit Lowri had been to the Royal Glamorgan at Llantrisant because of self-harming on several occasions prior to her death. She was admitted to the hospital on 4 February 2020 after taking an overdose and was identified as a ""high risk of suicide,"" according to a review conducted by the health board. She took a further overdose while in the hospital's mental health unit and self-harmed. She was discharged after three days. Her mother Sue, from Beddau, Rhondda Cynon Taf, believes Lowri was seen as a ""nuisance."" ""With the discharge it was totally against our wishes,"" she said. ""We couldn't have been more strong in how we felt that she was a grave risk to herself. ""I didn't want her just to be a statistic that they would learn from. And here we are, because they didn't listen."" Lowri's sister Rhiannon said the hospital did not help her sister in her ""dire need"". Lowri had a happy childhood, say her family Lowri's sister Rhiannon questions the conclusion her sister's death was ""not predictable or preventable"" Sue and Rhiannon remember Lowri being a ""very happy little girl"" who had a ""fab childhood"" and loved football, but she ""went down a bad path"" in her teenage years. She got in trouble with the police on several occasions and ended up being jailed. She was later diagnosed with an emotionally unstable personality disorder. After prison, her mother says she had several ""happy and healthy years,"" but her mental health deteriorated in 2018 following a bereavement. BBC Wales Live has seen a review carried out by the health board following Lowri's death which concludes that ""this tragic incident"" was ""neither predictable, nor preventable,"" but it also raises questions about her care at the hospital. After prison, Lowri enjoyed several happy years, but her mental health was later affected by a bereavement The review found there was a ""lack of exploration"" of the concerns raised by Lowri's social worker and mother about her state of mind and ""suicidal thoughts"" and that there were ""clear expressions of hopelessness and distress"" from her. It states there was no mechanism to pause the discharge, despite the fact that Lowri was found on the bathroom floor after self-harming with a razor blade the day before and had told staff ""no one was listening to her"". It recommended that a process should be established whereby any member of the team looking after a patient, or a family member, can temporarily pause an inpatient discharge if they feel it to be unsafe. It also finds that there was no evidence of the ""escalation process"" for ""frequent attenders"" being activated. Lowri's sister Rhiannon questions the conclusion her sister's death was ""not predictable or preventable"". ""In that report, they highlighted themselves that she didn't trigger their own escalation policy. So they failed her, massively so. ""If they did nothing wrong with my sister, why is there a new discharge plan that was implemented, because of how they discharged Lowri?"" Sue would like to meet the health minister to discuss ""what is going on"" with the mental health service at the hospital. ""They haven't treated my daughter as a human being. They have failed her miserably and we've lost someone so special in our lives."" Sue and Rhiannon are looking for answers There are also broader concerns about the area's mental health service. Shortly after Lowri was released, Zara Radcliffe, who went on to kill a man in a supermarket, was discharged from the hospital after being assessed as ""low risk."" Later that year the health board said it would conduct a ""rigorous"" review of the case. HIW's review is assessing whether Cwm Taf Morgannwg's arrangements for the discharge of mental health patients into the community are ""safe and effective"". It was prompted by serious incident notifications submitted to the Welsh government, external concerns received by HIW and previous HIW mental health inspections. A report is due to be published in August. Greg Dix, Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board's executive director of nursing and patient care, said: ""We would like to offer our most sincere and heartfelt condolences to Lowri's family once again. ""We appreciate how hard it is to lose a loved one, especially in such tragic circumstances. ""We accept the coroner's verdict following the inquest into Lowri's death. ""As a health board we are committed to listening and learning which then allows us to improve the care and service we deliver to our patients. ""As part of that listening and learning, we will now work with HIW on their report and look forward to taking on board any recommendations they may make. ""Our thoughts and sympathies continue to be with Lowri's family as they try to come to terms with their loss."" For more on this story watch Wales Live on BBC iPlayer.

Nomia IqbalBBC News In a country where US lawmakers don't usually agree on much, helping Ukraine has become a rare area of bipartisan agreement. Most Democrats and Republicans have come together to help the embattled country and this latest package, worth nearly $40bn, was backed by 86 out of 100 senators in both parties. This round of aid is a mixture of military, economic and humanitarian assistance. It includes more weapons, a fund to help Ukraine's government function and cash to stop the disruption to the global food chain as a result of the war. It's the biggest aid package so far and brings the total American investment in the warto roughly $54 billion in just over two months. This bipartisan moment may not last though. The Republicans who did oppose the package said they are concerned about continuously sending huge amounts of money abroad for an ongoing conflict, especially whilst Americans are struggling with economic challenges at home. President Biden is expected quickly to sign it into law - he and Ukrainian leaders pushed hard for its approval over fears aid would run out by the end of the week. More now on the $40bn aid package that the US Senate has approved to send to Ukraine - the largest aid package since Russia began its war. US President Joe Biden applauded members for sending ""a clear bipartisan message to the world"" that the people of the United States ""stand together with the brave people of Ukraine as they defend their democracy and freedom"". Biden said the resources he requested will allow the US to send more weapons and ammunition to Ukraine, replenish its own stockpile, and support US troops stationed on Nato territory. ""Together with the contributions of our allies and partners, we will keep security, economic, food, and humanitarian assistance flowing to Ukraine, across the region, and around the world, and further strengthen Ukraine - both on the battlefield and at the negotiating table."" Biden also signed off on $100 million of military aid to Ukraine, including additional artillery munitions and
counter artillery battery radars, the latest in a series of
transfers to help Kyiv repel Russia's invasion.

Now, the UN Development Programme (UNDP) has warned that 90% of people within Ukraine could be pushed into poverty if Russia continues its assault. ""We're talking about nine out of 10 Ukrainians falling into poverty if this war continues until the end of the year,"" UNDP deputy representative in Ukraine, Manal Fouani, says. She says this is a ""shocking number"", given the poverty rate in the country was just 2.5% just before the war started. Fouani said that 18 years of development gains could be lost by the end of the year  - the ""investments of the European Union and of all of the donors and the development partners in this country over the past 20 years"". The General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces has published its evening update on Facebook. It says:  The BBC is not able to independently verify this information.

For his part, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky welcomed the US funding package. In a tweet, he called the Senate's approval of the $40m boost ""a significant  contribution to the restoration of peace and security in Ukraine, Europe and the world"" and looked ahead to US President Joe Biden signing off the funds. His chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, said the package would help ensure Russia's defeat by Ukraine, adding: ""We are moving towards victory confidently and

The US Senate has approved nearly $40bn in aid for Ukraine - the largest aid package since Russia invaded. It includes military, economic and humanitarian assistance, and was voted through with 86 in favour and 11 against. The bill aims to release an urgently-needed injection of funds. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin had previously warned that authorised funds for sending weapons to Ukraine would run out today, and the bill had been delayed in the Senate. The package includes: It goes next to President Biden to be signed into law. McDonald's has found a local buyer for its Russian business, following its decision to end operating in the country over the war. Alexander Govor - who currently operates 25 McDonald's restaurants in Siberia - is set to take on the firm's  62,000 staff and operate its 850 businesses under a new brand. McDonald's did not disclose the sale price, but warns investors it expects to lose more than $1bn (Â£800m)  from the exit. Under the terms of the deal, the fast food giant's workers in Russia will be kept on their existing pay for at least two years, while Govor will pay the salaries of corporate staff until the deal is completed. McDonald's says it will retain its trademark in the country, but the restaurants will be stripped of their menu, logo and other branding. Read more about the dealhere. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken says Russia is using food as a weapon to break the spirit of the Ukrainian people, adding the blame for the food crisis clearly lies with Moscow. ""The Russian Federation claims falsely that the international community's sanctions are to blame for worsening the global food crisis. Sanctions aren't blocking Black Sea ports, trapping ships filled with food, and destroying Ukrainian roads and railways - Russia is,"" Blinken told a UN Security Council meeting. It comes as the Russian foreign ministry says it will only consider allowing access to Ukraine's Black Sea ports if the lifting of international sanctions against Russia is also considered. Blinken says the UN Security Council has a ""unique responsibility to address the current crisis"" and called on UN countries to put pressure on Russia to stop weaponizing food. ""Stop blockading the ports in the Black Sea and the sea of Azov, allow for the free flow of ships and trains and trucks carrying food out of Ukraine; stop preventing food and other life-saving supplies from reaching civilians in besieged Ukrainian towns and cities; stop threatening to withhold food and fertiliser exports from countries that criticise your war of aggression,"" Blinken said. The head of the UN World Food Programme, David Beasley, earlier appealed to President Putin to end Moscow's blockade of the ports to allow the export of wheat and other vital food products. Russian deputy foreign minister, Andrei Rudenko, says US and EU sanctions have helped to cause the current food crisis, Russia's Interfax news agency reports. It is hard to believe Ukraine needs help with a growing food crisis, given the country's role in feeding the world before the war, the United Nations says. Manal Fouani, a representative to Ukraine from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), tells the BBC that 90% of Ukrainians will fall into poverty by the end of the year if the conflict continues. Ukraine has a population of nearly 45 million, with 15 million people currently refugees or internally displaced within the country. Fouani says: ""It sounds difficult to believe that we need to feed Ukrainians, while Ukrainians feed the world."" She adds it is ""heartbreaking"" that grain silos in Ukraine are full because it is too difficult to export, so if farmers cultivate and harvest more crops there is no space to store them. Read more about UN warnings of a possible global food crisishere. The two leaders held talks in Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, in April UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson held a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky today to discuss opening ""critical"" sea and land supply routes for grain exports, after Russia's invasion caused supplies to be cut off, reducing the global supply and causing the price of alternatives to soar. It comes as the UN warned that Russia's invasion of Ukraine could sooncause a global food crisis that may last for years.

A Ukrainian soldier displays an anti-drone rifle in Kyiv. Russia claims to have destroyed a drone using a laser Russia claims to have used laser weapons on the battlefield in Ukraine, although the US says it has seen no evidence of this and Ukraine has derided it as propaganda. Yury Borisov, the deputy prime minister in charge of military development, told Russian TV that a laser prototype called Zadira was being deployed in Ukraine and had burned up a Ukrainian drone within five seconds at a distance of 5km (three miles). However, an official with the US Department of Defense said he had not seen ""anything to corroborate reports of lasers being used"" in Ukraine. Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has mocked the Russian claim, comparing it to the so-called ""wonder weapons"" that Nazi Germany claimed to be developing during World War Two.

Vitaly ShevchenkoBBC Monitoring Vadim Shishimarin, aged 21, has admitted killing 62-year-old civilian Oleksandr Shelipov One court case has been the focus of much of our coverage today - and there's been a near-total blackout in state-controlled Russian media on the war crimes trial of Russian soldier Vadim Shishimarin in Kyiv. BBC Monitoring has not observed any mentions of him on key TV channels, while there has been prominent reporting of the trial by independent Russian media, which is now operating from abroad. In a rare online report about Shishimarin, Kremlin-run broadcaster RT (also known as Russia Today)quoted his father,externalas doubting that he will get a fair hearing in Ukraine. ""What's that trial for? To prove him guilty,"" Yevgeny Shishimarin told RT. Asked about Shishimarin at a news briefing on 18 May, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskovsaid he did not have enough information,externalabout the soldier captured by Ukraine. You can read our correspondent Sarah Rainsford'sstory on the trial here. Returning now to the situation on the ground in Ukraine, 12 people have been killed in Ukrainian-controlled Severodonetsk after Russian shelling, the head of the eastern Luhansk Regional Military Administration has said on Telegram. Serhiy Hayday says more than 40 people who were injured in the attacks are receiving medical treatment - and there has been significant destruction leading to power cuts. Among the victims are two women found dead in a flat hit by a missile, he says in his post. At least eight houses have been damaged and rescuers were unable to reach places on fire for two hours because of the shelling, he adds. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Ministers are facing growing calls to bring forward large increases in benefits and the state pension which will be paid from next April. Charities want benefits to increase now to help people struggling with the cost of living, particularly energy bills. A well-established system means the annual increase in benefits will match this September's inflation rate - but will only be paid from April 2023. The Treasury says there are technical constraints in making earlier payments. Debt charity Stepchange said the government needed to address the shortfall between people's costs and their incomes. Richard Lane, from the charity, said: ""While we don't doubt that policymakers are aware of the problem, at present the measures being taken to plug the gap are simply not sufficient to help many households avoid incurring debt as a result of the rising cost of living."" Last month, Citizens Advice called on ministers to increase benefits in line with the current rate of inflation. State benefits including universal credit, older benefits such as disability support and jobseeker's allowance, and the state pension increase once a year, in April, to match the rising cost of living. They are pegged to the inflation rate the previous September, although the state pension can also be linked to higher earnings or 2.5% -known as the triple lock. Benefits and the state pension went up by 3.1% in April this year, to match the inflation rate in September 2021. At present, that is some way behind the rate at which prices are rising,which was at a 40-year high of 9% in April according to the latest official figures. Forecasts suggest the rate of price rises could climb by this September. In turn, that would mean a rise in benefits and the state pension of close to 10% in April 2023. In reality, people are paying higher prices for things now, but will receive higher benefits later. ""Intervention is urgently needed to catch people before they fall into crisis in the months to come because our social security system should be able to provide the protection to weather this storm,"" said Michael Clarke, head of information programmes at the charity Turn2us. ""The government must act as a matter of priority and ensure that as a minimum, benefit levels are increased to meet the true cost of living and they assess their own practices of benefit deductions so that money is not taken away from people at a time where they need it most."" Economists at leading think tanks said there would be little effect on the public finances - and the Â£250bn welfare bill - if the Treasury decided to bring forward some or all of that increase. ""There is pressure on the government to fast-track the rise,"" said Robert Joyce, deputy director at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, an economic research group. ""There has been a reluctance to do something so far."" Karl Handscomb, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation, said that keeping people waiting until next April was ""a recipe for more debt"". ""The main thing is the need to provide more support for those highly reliant on benefits,"" he said. He said some people on the state pension would be among the most vulnerable to rising energy bills in the coming winter. Pensioners Mike Gibbons 75 and his wife Ev, 72 have six daughters between them but the rising cost fuel makes visiting them very expensive. At the same time, the Southampton-based couple are grappling with an Â£88 monthly rise in energy bills after their provider PurePlanet went bust and they moved to Shell. Mike and Ev Gibbons are facing rising petrol and energy costs Mr Gibbons says that each 450-500 mile trip to see some of their family in Newcastle-under-Lyme now costs Â£25 more in petrol. Mrs Gibbons said: ""It's making it more difficult to see our family on a regular basis because you just can't afford it anymore the money's not there. We just can't see our children as much as we'd like to."" Imran Hussain, director of policy and campaigns at charity Action for Children, said that ""more and more families are starting to run out of road as they face inflation at its highest level in a generation, spiralling energy bills set to rise further and an entirely inadequate benefits system"". He said: ""They need help with meeting basic living costs now, not warm words hinting at action in the future."" There are no plans in the Treasury to increase benefits or the state pension before next April. One of the key reasons for that, according to Chancellor Rishi Sunak, is that the welfare systems involved made it technically difficult to change the uprating and paying of older benefits before April. It is possible to alter universal credit payments relatively quickly, as was done during the pandemic. Other payments such as disability support could take months to change. Mr Joyce said that IT issues were no excuse for inaction. ""Even if they need a few months' notice, that is better than waiting another year,"" he said. Mr Handscomb, from the Resolution Foundation - which focuses on people on lower incomes, said: ""If they get started now, they can do it before the next energy price rise in October."" Call to halt move to universal credit Student loan interest rate to hit 12% in England He said that the benefits system was the best way to get money to those who needed it but, even if that proved impossible, there were other ways to help people out. This targeted support could include paying more to aid people to pay their energy bills. The Treasury said such help was already in place. ""We understand that people are struggling with rising prices, and while we can't shield everyone from the global challenges we face, we are supporting British families to navigate the months ahead with a Â£22bn package of support,"" a government spokesman said. ""That includes saving the typical employee over Â£330 a year through a tax cut in July, allowing people on the universal credit taper rate to help people keep more of the money they earn - benefiting over a million families by around Â£1,000 a year, and providing millions of households with up to Â£350 each to help with rising energy bills.""

"Too many young people have died from eating disorders when their lives could have been saved with early treatment and help, psychiatrists say. New guidance, for all healthcare professionals across the UK sets out how to spot the signs of those at risk and how to best care for them. Hospital admissions for people with eating disorders have risen by 84% over the past five years in England. Charities said they were very concerned about the impact on all age groups. The Royal College of Psychiatrists' medical emergencies in eating disorders guidance,externalsays all healthcare professionals, no matter where they work, are increasingly likely to come into contact with someone with a severe eating disorder who needs urgent care. The Covid pandemichas made an already growing problem of eating disorders in young people even worse,with mental health charities saying lockdown, in particular, had a devastating impact on the most vulnerable. The latest NHS figures,externalshow there were 24,268 hospital admissions for eating disorders in England in 2020-21 - up from 13,219 in 2015-16 - with the biggest increases in those aged 18 and under. The large majority of those affected are young women, but admissions in young men have more than doubled in that time. James was admitted to hospital more than 20 times as a result of his eating disorders James Downs, 32, developed anorexia when he was 15 after experiencing a number of mental health problems - but it was nearly seven years before he saw an eating disorder specialist, because there were none where he lived in south Wales. ""Nobody had the specialist skills to help me,"" he says. When James ended up in hospital on a general ward, staff would openly tell him that nobody knew what to do. ""I was already in a crisis and very scared, but hearing that made me feel even more fear,"" James says. ""If they were panicking, it was quite terrifying for me."" James's health deteriorated over many years and, despite looking fit and well, he was admitted to hospital more than 20 times. Often this was with dangerously low potassium levels or heart issues - both consequences of malnutrition. ""It shouldn't have to get to that,"" he says. Health professionals frequently didn't know what language to use around eating disorders and would often trivialise his problems. And he found navigating the healthcare system while being forced to repeat his story to countless different people ""tiring and really difficult"". ""It comes down to training and awareness. Getting help early could prevent so many people from being admitted to hospital. ""We need informed care, not negative experiences."" Even when seriously unwell, people with eating disorders can appear to be healthy. To help recognise those at risk, the guidance contains practical tools and treatment advice for everyone from nurses to physios, A&E doctors, GPs and dietitians, as well as carers and patients. Psychiatrists started updating the guidance in 2019 after the ""tragic cases"" of three young people came to light, including19-year-old Averil Hart, who died from anorexia in 2012 after collapsing at her university flat. Dr Dasha Nicholls, an eating disorders psychiatrist for children and young people who led work on the guidelines, said eating disorders such as anorexia, bulimia and binge eating can affect people of any age and gender, and are not a lifestyle choice. ""They are mental health disorders, and we shouldn't underestimate how serious they are. ""Even though anorexia nervosa is often referred to as the deadliest mental health condition - most deaths are preventable with early treatment and support,"" she said. The new guidance must reach healthcare professionals urgently, Dr Nicholls said, if the eating disorders epidemic is to be stopped ""in its tracks"". Tom Quinn, from eating disorder charity Beat, said he hoped the guidance would ""make a huge difference"" because the sooner someone gets help, the better their chances of avoiding hospital admission and making a full recovery. But he said he was ""very concerned"" about the rise in hospital admissions for eating disorders across all age groups. He said the pandemic had had a huge impact on services that were already under strain. ""Front-line staff have been working tirelessly to support as many people as possible, but they cannot do so without adequate staffing and funding, which the government must make a priority,"" he said. The Department of Health and Social Care in England said it was investing Â£53m in children and young people's eating disorder services - to increase capacity in 70 community support teams across the country. It said a further Â£79m was being invested in children's mental health services so that at least 2,000 more children and young people can access eating disorder services.

"Geraint John says he wants to make Wales' coastline the ""envy of the world"" One man is embarking on the ""mammoth"" task of cleaning the beaches of Wales as he walks the 700-mile coastline. Geraint John, 51, of Maesteg, Bridgend county, said he wanted Wales' coastline to be the ""envy of the world"". After a five-month cycle around the UK last year, the amount of beach litter he saw did not sit right with him. ""All the fantastic places I went... the image that was stuck in my head was all the rubbish that's around the coastline of Britain,"" he said. ""I started going to my local beach, whenever I could. But I just felt it wasn't enough,"" said Geraint, who started his journey in the Mumbles, Swansea, on 13 May. Clean-up costs for firms if packaging is littered Teen litter picker honoured for clean-up campaign How clean are the UK's rivers and lakes? He said anywhere east of Swansea had too much rubbish for one man to collect, so he turned his sights west - heading towards Pembrokeshire and Cardigan Bay. Geraint said, even if communities regularly clean their beaches, more rubbish gets washed up by the tide ""Some beaches have been busy. I was down Rhossili and Llangennith beaches and I had about 26 black bags of rubbish from the five days I was there,"" he added. Mr John is currently in Ceredigion, roaming the beaches of Llangrannog, Cwmtydu and New Quay. But away from these popular beaches he said the smaller more remote coves were more of a challenge. ""The vast majority of the Welsh coastline isn't accessible, but rubbish doesn't care where it washes up. ""You could spend half a day cleaning this beach and around the corner, there could be 10 tonnes of rubbish just sitting in some secluded cove."" Geraint will be walking around 700 miles during his litter-picking mission As part of his walk he is trying to raise money in order to buy a boat to be able to get to ""all the places that you can't get to on foot where all the rubbish likes to hide"". The impact of plastic waste on the wildlife in Wales is clear to see, according to Sarah Perry from the Wildlife Trust, who said Geraint's task was a ""mammoth one"". ""Species like birds or seals can get entangled in sea fishing line or whatever's been discarded,"" she said. ""Other impacts are less obvious, because you can't really see them. We talk a lot these days about microplastics, they're like really tiny particles of plastic and that can be in the marine environment. ""Species like fish and birds, they will consume the microplastics and that then gets into their bodies and that can disrupt all sorts of bodily functions. "" ""We should be taking a leaf out of Geraint's book,"" said Sarah Perry of the Wildlife Trust Ms Perry said these microplastics could cause birds to starve to death as they think they are full, but their stomachs are actually just ""full of rubbish"". ""Some of the areas [Geraint is] trying to reach aren't easily accessible. But his determination is absolutely fantastic, brilliant. It's a great effort.""

"This video can not be played EuroMillions: Lottery winners scooped Â£184m with lucky dip ticket The UK's biggest EuroMillions lottery winners have been revealed as a couple from Gloucester who scooped Â£184m with a lucky dip ticket. Joe and Jess Thwaite won a record-breaking Â£184,262,899 - making them richer than Adele - last week. Mrs Thwaite, 44, who has two children with her 49-year-old husband, said the win will give them ""time to dream"". The previous record was held by an anonymous winner who bankedÂ£170min October 2019. After being introduced by TV presenter Dermot O'Leary at a glitzy ceremony on Thursday, Mr Thwaite confirmed that he had already left his job as a communications sales manager. His wife is also ""considering"" what to do about her role in a hairdressing salon she runs with her sister. Mrs Thwaite's initial reaction was disbelief when her husband told her the news Mr Thwaite discovered he had a win when he got up to walk the dogs at 05:15 BST last Tuesday. He said ""he didn't know what to do"" when he saw how much they had won. ""I couldn't go back to sleep, I didn't want to wake Jess up so I just laid there for what seemed like forever,"" he said. ""I spent some time searching for property with no budget limit, which was a novelty."" When his wife's alarm went off, Mr Thwaite told her: ""I've got a secret, I've got something to tell you."" Mrs Thwaite revealed her initial reaction was disbelief and she decided to get on with her routine before the couple confirmed the record win with National Lottery operator Camelot. The couple said they will use some of the money to fix their leaking roof The couple, formerly of Pershore in Worcestershire, said the win would give them ""time to share lots of experiences and go on adventures with our family and friends"". Mr Thwaite has been married to his wife, who runs the business side of the hairdressing salon with her sister, for 11 years. They have two primary school-aged children together and Joe has two university-aged children from a previous marriage. Mrs Thwaite said: ""Our two children have always talked about going to Hawaii, I've no idea why but we can now make that dream come true. ""Just to see their faces when we can make these things come true will be worth every penny."" The previous record of Â£170m was claimed by an anonymous UK player and the highest previous named winners areColin and Chris Weir, from North Ayrshire, who won Â£161m in 2011.

Mrs Thwaite revealed that her dad was a lifelong National Lottery player and her husband took over the mantle when he passed away seven years ago. Before his death, she explained that her father ""would always ask us what we'd do when we won"". ""It was a regular conversation and I feel like he was preparing us,"" she explained. ""Maybe that is why I seem so chilled, as I've kind of been ready to win for years."" Mr Thwaite said that when he started counting the number of digits, it was âamazing, but surrealâ The win will give the couple the money needed to work on the ""dream"" home they recently moved into. Mrs Thwaite said they bought the property to give their children a ""country-type lifestyle"" and share it with their three dogs, five chickens, two geckos and three ponies. ""Like many parents, we stretch ourselves to give our kids everything we can,"" she added. ""I always wanted them to be able to get up in their pyjamas, put wellies on and go out and feed the ponies and they can do that here. ""The fact the roof leaks and the house needs renovating was OK, as it was the life we dreamed of for our family."" The dilemma of what to do with a huge lottery win is the stuff of dreams for most people.

"New York state's top prosecutor has launched an investigation into the role social media companies played in Saturday's mass shooting in Buffalo. The inquiry will look at the extent that social platforms were ""used to stream, promote, or plan the event"", the attorney general's office said. The state's governor has argued tech firms share some blame for the attack. Critics say the companies were too slow to remove the alleged gunman's violent posts. Announcing the investigation on Wednesday, Attorney General Letitia James said: ""The terror attack in Buffalo has once again revealed the depths and danger of the online forums that spread and promote hate."" The suspect, who is white, allegedly posted a manifesto on Google and livestreamed the fatal shooting of 10 people at a supermarket in a predominantly black neighbourhood on Twitch, a company owned by Amazon. ""The fact that an individual can post detailed plans to commit such an act of hate without consequence, and then stream it for the world to see is bone-chilling and unfathomable,"" Ms James said.Â Platforms' Buffalo attack action called inadequate How far-right killers are radicalised online The stream was taken down less than two minutes after the violence began, Twitch said, but was duplicated on other streaming sites despite the removal. Facebook did not remove a link to the copied video for more than 10 hours, by which time it had been shared more than 46,000 times on the platform. A copy uploaded elsewhere was viewed more than three million times before being taken down. Ms James said the investigation would also target online forums 4chan, 8chan, and Discord where the gunman reportedly posted about his plans. The inquiry was ordered by Democratic Governor Kathy Hochul, who also directed the New York State Police to create a unit dedicated to monitoring social media for extremist threats. She is also asking the state legislature to pass tougher gun control measures. Her Republican critics in the state assembly have condemned her for not doing more to prevent mass shootings ahead of the attack. The US Department of Justice is investigating the attack as a hate crime.

"Stormont's Department of Health must start setting up a fully-funded abortion service for Northern Ireland ""within days to weeks"", Brandon Lewis has said. The Northern Ireland secretary has taken new powers to remove the need for the executive to approve plans first. Abortion is a devolved matter but commissioning a service has been held up due to political deadlock. But Mr Lewis said his latest step means that ""barrier"" has now been removed. The UK government had indicated it wouldact after the assembly election, if an executive was not restored by then. Now Mr Lewis has done that, saying he had a ""legal and moral duty"" to intervene due to the lack of progress. He gave details of the plan to Parliament on Thursday in a writtenministerial statement.,external ""The Department of Health has said the main thing that has held them up is not being able to get this through the executive - we've taken that away, they can now crack on and deliver it,"" he told BBC News NI. ""I think this has taken far too long already, it's a complicated legal area... we will allow the department a little bit of time to deliver on this."" Brandon Lewis previously said there would be ""no further barriers"" in commissioning abortion services The secretary of state declined to give a firm deadline but said the Department of Health needed to move quickly, adding: ""I am talking days to weeks."" If that does not happen, Mr Lewis has also taken other powers that will allow the government to then set up the services itself. Timeline: Abortion in Northern Ireland Access to abortion has been available in Northern Ireland since April 2020 after new laws came into force, but it is largely limited to early medical terminations up to 10 weeks of pregnancy. Those seeking abortion services not yet provided by NI Health Trusts can access services in Great Britain through arrangements that are funded by the Department of Health. Last year, the NI Secretary ordered the Department of Health to getapproval from the executive to establish services by no later than March 2022. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) is anti-abortion and vowed to block the proposals. The party also withdrew Paul Givan as first minister in February, leading to the collapse of the power-sharing executive which he jointly chaired. The Department of Health said Robin Swann - who remains in place as caretaker health minister - was unable to bring draft commissioning proposals forward without a functioning executive. The health minister said the new regulations would be given ""careful consideration"" by the department. Mr Swann said: ""I will be seeking further legal advice, including with regard to a Northern Ireland minister of health's legal responsibilities under the ministerial code"". Sinn FÃ©in vice-president Michelle O'Neill welcomed the intervention by Mr Lewis, saying abortion services ""must be provided now"". ""Finally women will receive the modern compassionate health care they are entitled to. The commissioning of abortion services has been blocked to this point,"" she wrote in a tweet ""No more delays. It must be provided now."" DUP MP for Upper Bann Carla Lockhart said devolution should be respected. ""This should be for the people of Northern Ireland to decide what services they want, if any,"" she told BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme. ""It is for our department and our executive to do just that"". Ms Lockhart said the UK government should ""spend time on other issues"", like making changes to the Northern Ireland Protocol. ""It is absolutely vitally important that the UK government step back from this roughshod approach, take action on the issues that they need to take action on and then let the executive decide on this devolved issue"". The DUP has refused to return to Stormont since the assembly election on May 5. It blocked the election of a Speaker to a new assembly, meaning it cannot function, until its concerns about post-Brexit trading arrangements are resolved. Mr Lewis has rejected suggestions that his actions could be interpreted as a step by Westminster towards reintroducing direct rule. ""I've been very clear about my first choice, to see this done the way it should be done at Stormont,"" he said. ""It's a balance for us as this is a devolved area but we will strain every sinew to work with the Department of Health to get this done."" It is understood it could cost about Â£5m per year to run a permanent, fully-funded abortion service for Northern Ireland. Mr Lewis insisted it was ""within the budget the Department of Health has got"", without further funding from Westminster. ""Â£5m is a lot of money - but it's not a lot of money when you look at the several hundreds of millions of pounds that hasn't been spent, that the executive has already had,"" he added. ""So they've definitely got the money for this, but they have to have the determination to deliver for women in Northern Ireland."" The Department of Health said it would consider the implications of Mr Lewis's latest intervention. It also said limited abortion services for up to 10 weeks of pregnancy were already available to all women in Northern Ireland.

"Legislation introduced to deal with legacy issues related to the Northern Ireland Troubles is a cause for ""serious concern"", Ireland's foreign affairs minister has said. The UK government bill involves immunity from prosecution for those who co-operate with investigations. It also prevents future inquests and civil actions related to the Troubles. Simon Coveney said the Irish government cannot support the bill ""in its current form"". Earlier, the commissioner for victims and survivors said the legislation would remove the opportunity for justice for some victims. Ian Jeffers said this was ""a very bitter pill to swallow"". ""Everybody recognises it's 40 years, it's 50 years, the chances of a conviction are very slim,"" he told BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme. ""But if you've lost your mother or your son are you going to genuinely give that up? ""I think that's the big issue we've got to talk through with victims and survivors over the coming weeks."" The 100-page Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Bill sets out investigations run by a new information recovery body. The Independent Commission for Reconciliation and Information Recovery (ICRIR) will be headed by a judicial figure appointed by the government and would be operational for five years. Simon Coveney said the Irish government could not support the proposals in their current form The panel within ICRIR will decide if a perpetrator qualifies for immunity. Civil claims which already existed on or before the day of the bill's introduction will be allowed to continue. Inquests which have reached substantive hearing stage a year after the bill, or by the time the ICRIR becomes operational, can also go ahead. What were the Troubles? Troubles legacy plan looks toward South Africa Sandra Peake, chief executive of victims' group Wave Trauma Centre, said the families of victims wanted fairness and equity. ""Ultimately what they want to know is that their loved one's life mattered and that there has been a full process to account for that,"" she told Good Morning Ulster. Speaking about the issue of immunity for perpetrators she said: ""Why is murder in relation to the Troubles different to murder undertaken in the streets of London? ""We have families who continue to be jeered at, sneered at and winked at by those responsible for their loved ones murders."" In a statement issued on Wednesday, Mr Coveney said: ""It is disappointing that the UK Government have chosen to unilaterally introduce legislation, when our starting point was the need for an agreement to be reached between both governments and the parties, and with the needs of victims and survivors at the heart of the process"". The minister said he had concerns about the powers of the commission, the status of 'reviews' proposed in the bill and its compliance with European Convention on Human Rights. ""We will continue to engage with the UK Government, at all levels, to better understand the provisions of this bill and the policy intent, but at this initial stage, I have serious concerns and cannot support it in its current form,"" he continued. Kenny Donaldson from Innocent Vicitims United Kenny Donaldson from Innocent Victims United, which represents 12,500 families in Northern Ireland, said victims and survivors are being asked to ""be party to the effective closing off of the past"". ""That is a huge ask for people who have already suffered so grievously,"" he added. Helen Deery, whose 15-year-old brother Manus was with a group of friends when he was shot in the head by a soldier from an observation post on Londonderry's walls in May 1972, said his death was still ""heartbreaking"". A coronerruled in 2017 that he was ""totally innocent"" and did not pose a threat to anyone. Helen Deery, whose brother Manus was shot and killed by a soldier in 1972, said the new law was disgusting ""I feel the exact same way today as the day he died. I won't rest until we get justice,"" she told BBC Radio Foyle. ""There is absolutely nothing in it (the bill) for victims."" Ms Deery added: ""We have never been consulted on anything. I think it is disgusting."" Veterans' Commissioner Danny Kinahan said he believed the legislation was ""a step in the right direction"". ""It is going to be difficult, we are never going to please everybody we have a system that doesn't work,"" he told Good Morning Ulster. ""We had to find a way where families and veterans' families are as important as everyone else and they want to know what happened. ""They also want a chance for justice."" Veterans' Commissioner Danny Kinahan said soldiers would want to give evidence to a new information recovery body Mr Kinahan said he was confident that soldiers ""want to come forward"" and provide information to the ICRIR. ""They want to show they did nothing wrong, they want to follow the rule of law, most importantly they want society to realise what they want through, what they did. ""They went out there, they stopped terrorism, they stopped a civil war and, in many cases, they find themselves being demonised. ""They want to go in there, give evidence, show they did nothing wrong.""

"This video can not be played A shop owner wrongly accused in the Post Office scandal describes frantic search for cash. A woman who was wrongly accused of taking Â£63,000 in a UK-wide post office scandal has described her frantic bid to pay money she did not owe. Sinead Rainey has given evidence toThe Post Office Horizon IT Inquirywhich is holding hearings in Belfast. The scandal saw more than700 people wrongly accused of theft, fraud and false accounting. It has been described as the most ""widespread miscarriage of justice in British legal history"". Between 2000 and 2014, a flaw in a newly installed computer system made it look like money was missing from post offices. It led to suspensions, termination of contracts, wrongful prosecutions and convictions. What is the Post Office Horizon saga all about? Convicted Post Office workers have names cleared Post Office scandal victims wait for compensation 'I did not steal Â£16,000 from Post Office' Ms Rainey, from Moneyglass, County Antrim, owned a Spar shop which had a post office in it, but she was not the sub-postmistress. She told the inquiry about the day post office auditors visited the store demanding that she repay discrepancies worth Â£63,000 within an hour. ""I drove home and I lifted a bucket in my house."" She said she emptied her children's money box into it and ""any money that I had in the house - 2ps, 5ps, everything"". Several family members helped her gather about Â£42,000 in the bucket. More than 700 post office employees were wrongly accused of crimes between 2000 and 2014 ""The auditors made me stand there and watch them count it. They tutted and made me feel so lousy for bringing them all of these pennies but I brought them whatever I could."" Ms Rainey also told the inquiry that relationships with close relatives have broken down. ""I don't go anywhere. I don't do anything,"" she said. ""I don't even visit my own mother and father-in-law because I feel like I let them down because I wrecked their son's life because of what happened to me. ""I will never be the person I was before."" Deirdre Connolly told the inquiry that post office officials used ""bully boy tactics"" toaccuse her in the wrong of fraud. She was removed from her post office at Killeter, County Tyrone, in 2010. She said she never received formal training when she took over the post office and the available helpline, which she phoned several times, did not understand her accent. Ms Connolly described how she was told to plead guilty and forced to repay a discrepancy of over Â£15,000 which she did not owe. Her family had to re-mortgage their home and were declared bankrupt. Deirdre Connolly says what happened cost her her livelihood, health and reputation ""Financially, we were ruined,"" she commented. In a meeting with a fraud investigator, Ms Connolly said she was asked if she took the money for paramilitary organisations. ""All I could think of is is this going to get out? Are they going to say that I've been taking money? I felt for the safety of my family,"" she said. She described how the action against her caused financial hardship and a mental health breakdown. ""My mental health will never be the same again. Constant tablets,"" she said. Heather Earley had to leave her post office in Newtownabbey in 2017 after the faulty computer system prompted discrepancies and authorised illegitimate payments to a customer. She said she was told she had to repay the money, but the post office refused to pay her back when the customer was arrested and plead guilty to the alleged crime. On a different occasion, Ms Earley was told her post office would be closed down if she did not pay back Â£112 of Christmas stamps which were missing. She told the inquiry she had to pay nearly Â£50,000 to keep her head above water. Heather Earley said her community suffered from the ordeal Heather said she was in ""a very dark place"" while dealing with the stress of the discrepancies. ""I was taking loans from family members and I had three credit cards maxed just to get stock for the shop,"" she said. ""It was horrendous what me and my family went through. ""My community suffered. They lost their post office and local shop that a lot of elderly people relied on."" In a concluding statement, the former sub-postmistress called for others to come forward and tell their story. Sinn FÃ©in vice-president Michelle O'Neill met with some of those affected by the scandal before proceedings started on Wednesday. She said they had suffered ""mental anguish"" and were speaking out to reclaim their voice and their reputation. ""These women have been wronged on every level and it's not just about an economic impact or a loss of finances or their business, it's about the loss of their reputation, it's been about the trauma they have experienced every day since these accusations happened, for some cases going back many many years,"" she added. ""It's been a massive miscarriage of justice and I am grateful to stand here with these fine women to be able to say they are going to have the opportunity to put right what has been wrong and everything that has been said wrong about them. This is their day."" The inquiry, under the chairmanship of retired high court judge Sir Wyn Williams, has invited evidence from former and current sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses, their assistants, managers and family members who have been affected by the scandal. Some 19 post office workers in Northern Ireland were convicted, but it is believed there were more victims of the scandal who have not come forward. It is thought some people have been reluctant to do so because of the stigma of being accused in the wrong. Sir Wyn has already heard from victims in other parts of the UK and this is the final week of the human impact hearings. Hearings will also be held in Belfast on Thursday.

"Geraint John says he wants to make Wales' coastline the ""envy of the world"" One man is embarking on the ""mammoth"" task of cleaning the beaches of Wales as he walks the 700-mile coastline. Geraint John, 51, of Maesteg, Bridgend county, said he wanted Wales' coastline to be the ""envy of the world"". After a five-month cycle around the UK last year, the amount of beach litter he saw did not sit right with him. ""All the fantastic places I went... the image that was stuck in my head was all the rubbish that's around the coastline of Britain,"" he said. ""I started going to my local beach, whenever I could. But I just felt it wasn't enough,"" said Geraint, who started his journey in the Mumbles, Swansea, on 13 May. Clean-up costs for firms if packaging is littered Teen litter picker honoured for clean-up campaign How clean are the UK's rivers and lakes? He said anywhere east of Swansea had too much rubbish for one man to collect, so he turned his sights west - heading towards Pembrokeshire and Cardigan Bay. Geraint said, even if communities regularly clean their beaches, more rubbish gets washed up by the tide ""Some beaches have been busy. I was down Rhossili and Llangennith beaches and I had about 26 black bags of rubbish from the five days I was there,"" he added. Mr John is currently in Ceredigion, roaming the beaches of Llangrannog, Cwmtydu and New Quay. But away from these popular beaches he said the smaller more remote coves were more of a challenge. ""The vast majority of the Welsh coastline isn't accessible, but rubbish doesn't care where it washes up. ""You could spend half a day cleaning this beach and around the corner, there could be 10 tonnes of rubbish just sitting in some secluded cove."" Geraint will be walking around 700 miles during his litter-picking mission As part of his walk he is trying to raise money in order to buy a boat to be able to get to ""all the places that you can't get to on foot where all the rubbish likes to hide"". The impact of plastic waste on the wildlife in Wales is clear to see, according to Sarah Perry from the Wildlife Trust, who said Geraint's task was a ""mammoth one"". ""Species like birds or seals can get entangled in sea fishing line or whatever's been discarded,"" she said. ""Other impacts are less obvious, because you can't really see them. We talk a lot these days about microplastics, they're like really tiny particles of plastic and that can be in the marine environment. ""Species like fish and birds, they will consume the microplastics and that then gets into their bodies and that can disrupt all sorts of bodily functions. "" ""We should be taking a leaf out of Geraint's book,"" said Sarah Perry of the Wildlife Trust Ms Perry said these microplastics could cause birds to starve to death as they think they are full, but their stomachs are actually just ""full of rubbish"". ""Some of the areas [Geraint is] trying to reach aren't easily accessible. But his determination is absolutely fantastic, brilliant. It's a great effort.""

"John Peel was the longest serving of the original BBC Radio 1 DJs, broadcasting from 1967 until his death in 2004 Rare items from the late veteran BBC DJ John Peel's collection - including a signed record from John Lennon and Yoko Ono - are to go under the hammer. John Peel was BBC Radio 1's longest-serving original DJ until his sudden death in 2004 at the age of 65, and lived near Stowmarket, Suffolk. His radio shows helped many music careers, including those of David Bowie, Queen and the Sex Pistols. His family said items had been carefully chosen for the14 June sale,external. The music legend would broadcast from his home studio in Suffolk - with his old gramophone one of the treasured pieces for sale Peel's real name was John Ravenscroft and he was born in Heswall, Cheshire and went to Shrewsbury School as a boarder. His widow and children said he had collected a ""wealth of souvenirs"" through his close access to stars and events. ""In going through the accumulation of 40 years of pop music moments, we decided that some of the most interesting items might find a home, with fans of his programme or of the artists whose music he played,"" they said. ""We hope these items find the attention and appreciation that we're sure John/Dad would feel they warranted. ""We had no desire to split up his beloved record collection but have included in the sale a selection of particularly rare or unique records that do not take away from the integrity of his archive."" Peel had amassed thousands of records in his personal home collection, with some items now being auctioned off In the 1980s, the broadcaster was a presenter on Top Of The Pops and regularly covered the Glastonbury Festival, with The John Peel Stage being dedicated to him in 2004. Objects from his collection, including records, personal correspondence and memorabilia, will be auctioned at Bonhams Knightsbridge on 14 June - the week before Glastonbury's 50th anniversary. John Lennon and Yoko Ono signed the inner sleeve of their specially-pressed album One item, with an estimate of between Â£15,000 and Â£20,000, is a mono pressing of Lennon and Ono's 1968 LP Two Virgins, 1968, which famously had them pictured naked on the cover. Other pieces include a signed Rolling Stones 1969 promo LP, estimated to go for Â£6,000-8,000, a Queen LP that comes with a letter from Freddie Mercury, with an estimate of Â£1,000-1,500, and a Joy Division single and letter - estimated at Â£4,000-Â£6,000. Katherine Schofield, of Bonhams, said: ""John Peel had an incredible impact on the new music landscape.

"The UK government failed in its duty of care to protect doctors and the wider healthcare workforce at the start of the pandemic, a doctors' union says. The British Medical Association review said staff were desperately let down by the lack of protective equipment. And they were still suffering the physical and mental health impacts, having seen levels of illness and death ""they were never trained for"". The government said lessons would be learned but defended its record on PPE. The BMA criticisms, based on feedback and testimonies from the union's members, will form part of its submission to the official public inquiry into the pandemic. Although healthcare is a devolved political issue, the UK government took on the role of making deals with PPE suppliers in order to supply equipment that was distributed across all four nations of the UK. One million NHS masks fail high-grade safety tests Doctors told the BMA that, during the early months of the pandemic, there were times they had to buy or make their own masks. And some reported being left with long-term health problems from Covid infections. One junior medic, in Scotland, said they remained bedbound, after being infected in March 2020. ""My life as I knew it had ended,"" the medic said. Many doctors said they had felt pressured to work in hazardous situations, with inadequate risk assessments. The review also highlighted how doctors with an ethnic minority background had been more likely to die with Covid, in the early stages of the pandemic, than their white peers. Overall, Office for National Statistics data shows that, throughout 2020, doctors were no more likely than the general working-age population to die with Covid. But nurses and care workers were at higher risk - although, it is unclear how much that was related to exposure at work rather than other factors. The BMA, which has been critical of the government's response to the pandemic throughout, said the UK should have been better prepared and the problems had been made worse by the ""savage"" cuts to the public-health budget in the years before. BMA leader Dr Chaand Nagpaul said: ""A moral duty of government is to protect its own healthcare workers from harm in the course of duty as they serve and protect the nation's health. ""Yet, in reality, doctors were desperately let down by the UK government's failure to adequately prepare."" A government spokeswoman said enough PPE had been bought, in a ""very competitive global market"", to keep staff safe and mental health hubs had been set up to help them cope with trauma. But she added: ""We are committed to learning lessons from the Covid pandemic and will respond openly and transparently to the Inquiry and fully consider all recommendations made.""

Here's a recap of the day's key developments: As we reported earlier, Ukrainians are marking Vyshyvanka Day - a celebration of Ukrainian folk culture, particularly the wearing of traditional embroidered shirts. Here are some images taken as people came out to celebrate, despite the continuing war in the country. The designs on some vyshyvankas have meanings such as hope, fertility and protection Children were among those who gathered in Lviv Once traditionally white, vyshyankas are now made in a wide range of colours This performance took place in the western city of Lviv Sewing lessons were on offer in Odesa Three refugee sisters, together with friends and their host, marked the occasion with a giant shirt in Cambridge in the UK A famous cat from Kharkiv who raised thousands for Ukrainian animal shelters through his Instagram account has been given a prestigious award for his efforts. Stepan, who has 1.3 million followers, was given the World Influencers and Bloggers Award during a ceremony at Cannes Film Festival in France on 18 May. Money raised during the event will be spent on helping those who suffered during the war in Ukraine, its organisers said. Stepan's owner, Anna, said the pair escaped from the north-eastern Ukrainian city in March and crossed the border into Poland before being evacuated to France, where their fundraising efforts continue.

Nomia IqbalBBC News In a country where US lawmakers don't usually agree on much, helping Ukraine has become a rare area of bipartisan agreement. Most Democrats and Republicans have come together to help the embattled country and this latest package, worth nearly $40bn, was backed by 86 out of 100 senators in both parties. This round of aid is a mixture of military, economic and humanitarian assistance. It includes more weapons, a fund to help Ukraine's government function and cash to stop the disruption to the global food chain as a result of the war. It's the biggest aid package so far and brings the total American investment in the warto roughly $54 billion in just over two months. This bipartisan moment may not last though. The Republicans who did oppose the package said they are concerned about continuously sending huge amounts of money abroad for an ongoing conflict, especially whilst Americans are struggling with economic challenges at home. President Biden is expected quickly to sign it into law - he and Ukrainian leaders pushed hard for its approval over fears aid would run out by the end of the week. More now on the $40bn aid package that the US Senate has approved to send to Ukraine - the largest aid package since Russia began its war. US President Joe Biden applauded members for sending ""a clear bipartisan message to the world"" that the people of the United States ""stand together with the brave people of Ukraine as they defend their democracy and freedom"". Biden said the resources he requested will allow the US to send more weapons and ammunition to Ukraine, replenish its own stockpile, and support US troops stationed on Nato territory. ""Together with the contributions of our allies and partners, we will keep security, economic, food, and humanitarian assistance flowing to Ukraine, across the region, and around the world, and further strengthen Ukraine - both on the battlefield and at the negotiating table."" Biden also signed off on $100 million of military aid to Ukraine, including additional artillery munitions and
counter artillery battery radars, the latest in a series of
transfers to help Kyiv repel Russia's invasion. Ukrainian volunteers prepare to deliver food inside a complex set up as a shelter in Zaporizhzhya We've been reporting onthe growing food crisis in Ukraineand accusations thatRussia is using food as a weapon of war, including by blocking ports in Ukraine's Black Sea. Now, the UN Development Programme (UNDP) has warned that 90% of people within Ukraine could be pushed into poverty if Russia continues its assault. ""We're talking about nine out of 10 Ukrainians falling into poverty if this war continues until the end of the year,"" UNDP deputy representative in Ukraine, Manal Fouani, says. She says this is a ""shocking number"", given the poverty rate in the country was just 2.5% just before the war started. Fouani said that 18 years of development gains could be lost by the end of the year  - the ""investments of the European Union and of all of the donors and the development partners in this country over the past 20 years"". The General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces has published its evening update on Facebook. It says:  The BBC is not able to independently verify this information. This video can not be played Ukrainian soldiers blow up a bridge connecting cities in the Luhansk region Earlier on Thursday, Ukraine's National Guard released a video it said shows the destruction of a bridge connecting Sievierodonetsk to Rubizhne in the Luhansk region. The special operation between Ukraine's security forces aims to slow down the advance of Russian troops in the Luhansk region. The BBC has not been able to independently verify the images. We'll turn now to the besieged Azovstal steelworks in the city of Mariupol, where some Ukrainian fighters are still believed to be holed up - although it's unclear how many. The Deputy Commander of the Azov unit, Sviatoslav Palamar hasposted a video message on Telegram,,externalin which he says: âGlory to Ukraine! It is day 85 of the war. The leadership and I are on the premises of the Azovstal plant. There is a certain operation happening, details of which I am not going to share. I thank the whole world and Ukraine for the support. I will be seeing you.â It is not clear what the operation he refers to is. We will bring you more information if it becomes available. Russia says more than 1,700 fighters from the plant have been taken to Russian-controlled areas since Monday. You canread about what has been happening to them here. For his part, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky welcomed the US funding package. In a tweet, he called the Senate's approval of the $40m boost ""a significant  contribution to the restoration of peace and security in Ukraine, Europe and the world"" and looked ahead to US President Joe Biden signing off the funds. His chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, said the package would help ensure Russia's defeat by Ukraine, adding: ""We are moving towards victory confidently and
strategically. We thank our allies."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The US Senate has approved nearly $40bn in aid for Ukraine - the largest aid package since Russia invaded. It includes military, economic and humanitarian assistance, and was voted through with 86 in favour and 11 against. The bill aims to release an urgently-needed injection of funds. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin had previously warned that authorised funds for sending weapons to Ukraine would run out today, and the bill had been delayed in the Senate. The package includes: It goes next to President Biden to be signed into law. McDonald's has found a local buyer for its Russian business, following its decision to end operating in the country over the war. Alexander Govor - who currently operates 25 McDonald's restaurants in Siberia - is set to take on the firm's  62,000 staff and operate its 850 businesses under a new brand. McDonald's did not disclose the sale price, but warns investors it expects to lose more than $1bn (Â£800m)  from the exit. Under the terms of the deal, the fast food giant's workers in Russia will be kept on their existing pay for at least two years, while Govor will pay the salaries of corporate staff until the deal is completed. McDonald's says it will retain its trademark in the country, but the restaurants will be stripped of their menu, logo and other branding. Read more about the dealhere. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken says Russia is using food as a weapon to break the spirit of the Ukrainian people, adding the blame for the food crisis clearly lies with Moscow. ""The Russian Federation claims falsely that the international community's sanctions are to blame for worsening the global food crisis. Sanctions aren't blocking Black Sea ports, trapping ships filled with food, and destroying Ukrainian roads and railways - Russia is,"" Blinken told a UN Security Council meeting. It comes as the Russian foreign ministry says it will only consider allowing access to Ukraine's Black Sea ports if the lifting of international sanctions against Russia is also considered. Blinken says the UN Security Council has a ""unique responsibility to address the current crisis"" and called on UN countries to put pressure on Russia to stop weaponizing food. ""Stop blockading the ports in the Black Sea and the sea of Azov, allow for the free flow of ships and trains and trucks carrying food out of Ukraine; stop preventing food and other life-saving supplies from reaching civilians in besieged Ukrainian towns and cities; stop threatening to withhold food and fertiliser exports from countries that criticise your war of aggression,"" Blinken said. The head of the UN World Food Programme, David Beasley, earlier appealed to President Putin to end Moscow's blockade of the ports to allow the export of wheat and other vital food products. Russian deputy foreign minister, Andrei Rudenko, says US and EU sanctions have helped to cause the current food crisis, Russia's Interfax news agency reports. It is hard to believe Ukraine needs help with a growing food crisis, given the country's role in feeding the world before the war, the United Nations says. Manal Fouani, a representative to Ukraine from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), tells the BBC that 90% of Ukrainians will fall into poverty by the end of the year if the conflict continues. Ukraine has a population of nearly 45 million, with 15 million people currently refugees or internally displaced within the country. Fouani says: ""It sounds difficult to believe that we need to feed Ukrainians, while Ukrainians feed the world."" She adds it is ""heartbreaking"" that grain silos in Ukraine are full because it is too difficult to export, so if farmers cultivate and harvest more crops there is no space to store them. Read more about UN warnings of a possible global food crisishere. The two leaders held talks in Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, in April UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson held a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky today to discuss opening ""critical"" sea and land supply routes for grain exports, after Russia's invasion caused supplies to be cut off, reducing the global supply and causing the price of alternatives to soar. It comes as the UN warned that Russia's invasion of Ukraine could sooncause a global food crisis that may last for years. In a tweet, Johnson said he blamed Russian President Vladimir Putin's ""reckless blockade of Black Sea ports""for causing global economic damage.,external Zelensky said the pair also discussed ""the operation to rescue military from Azovstal"" and ""ways to export agricultural products"" and import fuel to Ukraine. Meanwhile, Ukraineâs foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, also said hespoke with his British counterpart, Liz Truss,external, about how to âhold Russia accountable for its aggression and unblock Ukraineâs food exportsâ. ""Russia bears full responsibility not only for killing, torturing, and raping Ukrainians, but also for starving people across the world, including in Africa,"" Kuleba said in a tweet. A Ukrainian soldier displays an anti-drone rifle in Kyiv. Russia claims to have destroyed a drone using a laser Russia claims to have used laser weapons on the battlefield in Ukraine, although the US says it has seen no evidence of this and Ukraine has derided it as propaganda. Yury Borisov, the deputy prime minister in charge of military development, told Russian TV that a laser prototype called Zadira was being deployed in Ukraine and had burned up a Ukrainian drone within five seconds at a distance of 5km (three miles). However, an official with the US Department of Defense said he had not seen ""anything to corroborate reports of lasers being used"" in Ukraine. Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has mocked the Russian claim, comparing it to the so-called ""wonder weapons"" that Nazi Germany claimed to be developing during World War Two.

BBC Monitoring has not observed any mentions of him on key TV channels, while there has been prominent reporting of the trial by independent Russian media, which is now operating from abroad. In a rare online report about Shishimarin, Kremlin-run broadcaster RT (also known as Russia Today)quoted his father,externalas doubting that he will get a fair hearing in Ukraine.

"Sam Bowstead's home in Brisbane was among thousands of properties hit by floods in February ""It's devastating. The amount of time and effort you put in your home and then to see it go under water."" Sam Bowstead is an architect who specialises in preparing houses to withstand natural disasters. But when floods engulfed his Brisbane home in February, he felt helpless. ""I've worked with people who've been in similar situations - now this happened to me,"" he says. ""I was shocked at how fast [the water] rose... more than a metre in a couple of hours. I went from being worried about our property to being worried about our safety."" In the end, a boat was the only way out. Mr Bowstead's experience has become increasingly common for Australians. In the past three years, record-breaking bushfire and flood events have killed more than 500 people and billions of animals. Drought, cyclones and freak tides have gripped communities. Climate change is a key concern for voters in Australia's election on Saturday. So is the cost of living - and these issues are converging like never before. Australia is facing an ""insurability crisis"" with one in 25 homes on track to be effectively uninsurable by 2030, according to a Climate Council report. Another one in 11 are at risk of being underinsured. Insurance for the highest-risk homes will be prohibitively expensive or refused by providers, says the Climate Council, which createdan interactive map for Australians to search,external. ""Climate change is playing out in real time here and many Australians now find it impossible to insure their homes and businesses,"" says chief executive Amanda McKenzie. Nowhere is this a bigger issue than in Queensland. It is home to almost 40% of the 500,000 homes projected to be effectively uninsurable. Queensland has been ravaged by floods in recent months. In February, the state capital Brisbane had more than 70% of its average yearly rainfall in just three days. ""I still feel quite traumatised when it rains heavily,"" says Michelle Vine, whose East Brisbane home was destroyed along with decades of her artwork. ""We had to move out of the home - it became unliveable."" Michelle Vine lost artwork she had spent years making Insurers say the floods - which also battered New South Wales - will become Australia's most expensive flood event ever. But even before this year, insurance costs were skyrocketing. Though rising property prices are one factor, Australia's peak insurance industry body points the finger at climate change. The Insurance Council of Australia says no parts of the country are currently uninsurable but there are ""clearly affordability and availability concerns"". Over the past decade, the amount paid out by insurers on damage claims from natural disasters has roughly doubled. On average, consumers now pay almost four times for home insurance premiums than in 2004. In northern Australia, these numbers are even more extreme - in some cases 10 times higher than elsewhere. More Australians are being forced to underinsure - purchase cheaper policies that cover too little - or forgo insurance altogether. ""This is probably Australia's most important cost-of-living issue,"" Dr Antonia Settle, a political economist at the University of Melbourne, tells the BBC. ""Households that don't have insurance risk losing their most important asset."" The phenomenon could also exacerbate social inequality and create ""climate ghettos"", says Climate Valuation, a risk analysis company. Properties in higher-risk areas are becoming cheaper to buy and rent, often attracting people who are least able to afford adequate insurance, compounding the financial impact of disasters. ""People are not moving away from climate-endangered places in Australia. And in fact, along the fringes of the major cities, they are more likely to move toward them,"" says demographer Liz Allen from the Australian National University. ""The housing affordability issue in Australia is so direâ¦ that people see climate catastrophe as almost a bargain, a way to ensure that they can have a place to call their own."" Sam Bowstead says he moved to his area for price reasons Ms Vine is one example of this - saying she was drawn to a vulnerable area by price. At the time, she felt like she'd ""won the lottery"". Mr Bowstead made a similar choice, describing it as ""a Catch-22... for young people"". And once in a risky area, it's near impossible for many to get out - as is the case for Gary Godley in the town of Grantham, west of Brisbane. Given Grantham's horrific flood history - 12 people died there in 2011 - there are no takers for his home. ""We want out. We just can't afford it,"" Mr Godley says. ""We can't do anything."" The government has promised billions to help ""reinsure"" insurers against major claims resulting from disasters, arguing it will essentially halve premiums for people in northern Australia. But it is a risky policy, and not one either the Insurance Council of Australia or the country's industry watchdog wanted. Critics have pointed out that disasters are now frequently devastating areas outside northern Australia that won't be covered by the policy. What about their premiums? They're instead calling for the government to limit development in high-risk areas, consider buying out some homeowners, or create incentives for people to make their properties disaster-resilient. But the obvious answer is addressing climate change, Dr Settle says - though this is something successive governments have been reluctant to do. After massive bushfires in 2019-20,Australians were warned to preparefor an ""alarming"" future of simultaneous and worsening disasters. Yet for a nation so exposed to climate change, Australia remains one of the world's biggest emitters per head of population. Prime Minister Scott Morrison's government has promised to reduce emissions by 26% by 2030. Labor, under Anthony Albanese, has pledged a 43% cut. Both are below the 50% recommended by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Most Australians want tougher climate action, but both parties have kept fairly quiet on the topic during this election campaign. In the town of Gladstone - which lies in a marginal seat in central Queensland - the reason for this avoidance is clear. Coal is an integral part of Gladstone. It's shipped from the local port and has helped Australia become the second-largest exporter globally and created thousands of jobs. Phil Golby, a local Australian Manufacturing Workers' Union official, says ""change is inevitable"" but fears fossil fuel workers will be left behind. ""I've heard a lot of talk. I've listened to a lot of presentations - but I haven't really seen a direct path yet,"" Mr Golby says. ""If a new industry comes [to Gladstone] we need to make sure that we're going to get our workforce trainedâ¦ [and] it's got to replace their pay. We can't start to see people going backwards."" More than 3000 homes were scorched in the Black Summer bushfires of 2019-20 Essentially, coal lies in that impossible place between Australia's prosperity, politics, and environmental perils. So phasing out fossil fuels is a politically toxic issue that no big party wants to tackle head-on, especially not during an election. That frustrates Mr Bowstead. For him and so many young people there's a real anxiety about what climate change will mean for how and where they'll live in the future. ""[It's] not going to happen - this is happening already,"" he says. ""It feels like we're going to have to take responsibility and bear the brunt of that for much longer than most of those people who are in power now.""

"Ministers are facing growing calls to bring forward large increases in benefits and the state pension which will be paid from next April. Charities want benefits to increase now to help people struggling with the cost of living, particularly energy bills. A well-established system means the annual increase in benefits will match this September's inflation rate - but will only be paid from April 2023. The Treasury says there are technical constraints in making earlier payments. Debt charity Stepchange said the government needed to address the shortfall between people's costs and their incomes. Richard Lane, from the charity, said: ""While we don't doubt that policymakers are aware of the problem, at present the measures being taken to plug the gap are simply not sufficient to help many households avoid incurring debt as a result of the rising cost of living."" Last month, Citizens Advice called on ministers to increase benefits in line with the current rate of inflation. State benefits including universal credit, older benefits such as disability support and jobseeker's allowance, and the state pension increase once a year, in April, to match the rising cost of living. They are pegged to the inflation rate the previous September, although the state pension can also be linked to higher earnings or 2.5% -known as the triple lock. Benefits and the state pension went up by 3.1% in April this year, to match the inflation rate in September 2021. At present, that is some way behind the rate at which prices are rising,which was at a 40-year high of 9% in April according to the latest official figures. Forecasts suggest the rate of price rises could climb by this September. In turn, that would mean a rise in benefits and the state pension of close to 10% in April 2023. In reality, people are paying higher prices for things now, but will receive higher benefits later. ""Intervention is urgently needed to catch people before they fall into crisis in the months to come because our social security system should be able to provide the protection to weather this storm,"" said Michael Clarke, head of information programmes at the charity Turn2us. ""The government must act as a matter of priority and ensure that as a minimum, benefit levels are increased to meet the true cost of living and they assess their own practices of benefit deductions so that money is not taken away from people at a time where they need it most."" Economists at leading think tanks said there would be little effect on the public finances - and the Â£250bn welfare bill - if the Treasury decided to bring forward some or all of that increase. ""There is pressure on the government to fast-track the rise,"" said Robert Joyce, deputy director at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, an economic research group. ""There has been a reluctance to do something so far."" Karl Handscomb, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation, said that keeping people waiting until next April was ""a recipe for more debt"". ""The main thing is the need to provide more support for those highly reliant on benefits,"" he said. He said some people on the state pension would be among the most vulnerable to rising energy bills in the coming winter. Pensioners Mike Gibbons 75 and his wife Ev, 72 have six daughters between them but the rising cost fuel makes visiting them very expensive. At the same time, the Southampton-based couple are grappling with an Â£88 monthly rise in energy bills after their provider PurePlanet went bust and they moved to Shell. Mike and Ev Gibbons are facing rising petrol and energy costs Mr Gibbons says that each 450-500 mile trip to see some of their family in Newcastle-under-Lyme now costs Â£25 more in petrol. Mrs Gibbons said: ""It's making it more difficult to see our family on a regular basis because you just can't afford it anymore the money's not there. We just can't see our children as much as we'd like to."" Imran Hussain, director of policy and campaigns at charity Action for Children, said that ""more and more families are starting to run out of road as they face inflation at its highest level in a generation, spiralling energy bills set to rise further and an entirely inadequate benefits system"". He said: ""They need help with meeting basic living costs now, not warm words hinting at action in the future."" There are no plans in the Treasury to increase benefits or the state pension before next April. One of the key reasons for that, according to Chancellor Rishi Sunak, is that the welfare systems involved made it technically difficult to change the uprating and paying of older benefits before April. It is possible to alter universal credit payments relatively quickly, as was done during the pandemic. Other payments such as disability support could take months to change. Mr Joyce said that IT issues were no excuse for inaction. ""Even if they need a few months' notice, that is better than waiting another year,"" he said. Mr Handscomb, from the Resolution Foundation - which focuses on people on lower incomes, said: ""If they get started now, they can do it before the next energy price rise in October."" Call to halt move to universal credit Student loan interest rate to hit 12% in England He said that the benefits system was the best way to get money to those who needed it but, even if that proved impossible, there were other ways to help people out. This targeted support could include paying more to aid people to pay their energy bills. The Treasury said such help was already in place. ""We understand that people are struggling with rising prices, and while we can't shield everyone from the global challenges we face, we are supporting British families to navigate the months ahead with a Â£22bn package of support,"" a government spokesman said. ""That includes saving the typical employee over Â£330 a year through a tax cut in July, allowing people on the universal credit taper rate to help people keep more of the money they earn - benefiting over a million families by around Â£1,000 a year, and providing millions of households with up to Â£350 each to help with rising energy bills.""

"Symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion Two more people with monkeypox have been identified, taking the total number of cases in the UK to nine. Both live in the South East of England - where most of the cases have been identified - and it is thought they got the infection through spread in the community, rather than travel. Monkeypox is usually linked with travel to West Africa. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) says the virus does not usually spread easily and the risk to people is low. Most of the cases so far are in men who are gay, bisexual or who have sex with men. What is monkeypox? UKHSA says people in these communities should be alert to unusual rashes or lesions on any part of their body, especially their genitalia, and contact a sexual health service if they have concerns. Monkeypox is not normally a sexually-transmitted infection, but it can be passed on by direct contact during sex. It can also be spread through: touching clothing, bedding or towels used by someone with the monkeypox rash touching monkeypox skin blisters or scabs the coughs or sneezes of a person with the monkeypox rash All those diagnosed in the UK are in England and most are based in London, andthe city's public health director said plans were in place to stock up on treatmentsin case infections rise further. Prof Kevin Fenton said treatments for monkeypox included vaccines and antiviral agents, and the current strategy was to ""vaccinate the highest priority people"", such as household contacts of those infected. ""We're watching closely to see how this spreads over the next week or two and then we'll get a better sense of how to project and plan for the month ahead,"" he added. Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser at UKHSA, said: ""These latest cases, together with reports of cases in countries across Europe, confirms our initial concerns that there could be spread of monkeypox within our communities. ""UKHSA has quickly identified cases so far and we continue to rapidly investigate the source of these infections and raise awareness among healthcare professionals."" Health officials are contacting anyone who is a close contact of those infected by monkeypox to provide health information and advice. Doctors are being asked to be alert to people coming forward with rashes without any clear diagnosis. Monkeypox signs can include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion. A rash can develop, often beginning on the face, then spreading to other parts of the body including the genitals. The rash changes - it can look like chickenpox or syphilis, before finally forming a scab which later falls off. It is usually a mild illness and most people recover within a few weeks.
