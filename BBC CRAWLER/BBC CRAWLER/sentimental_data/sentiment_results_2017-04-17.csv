The Sun's former royal editor, Duncan Larcombe, writes that he witnessed Prince Harry'sinner turmoil,externalwhen the prince tried to have him ejected from a party in 2008.

"Boston Marathon runners start their 26.2 mile journey in 2016 - Derek Murphy is looking for cheaters among them For months, a runner named Cindy posted motivational photos on Instagram and Facebook, chronicling the miles she put in to prepare for the New York Marathon. When the big day came, she posted about the gear, the energy gels, and the coconut waters that would sustain her through the 26.2 miles (42.1km) Cindy ran the race of her life, finishing the New York Marathon in just 3 hours 17 minutes and 29 seconds - a lot faster than her pace in previous half-marathon finishes, which each took a little over two hours. ""Ran my heart out today and left everything on the course. All the training paid off and qualified for the Boston Marathon!"" she posted on Instagram, along with a post-race selfie and a photo with the finisher's medal. But Cindy's incredible marathon time seemed just a little too incredible to a man sitting at his computer nearly 640 miles away. Derek Murphy, a former marathoner and business analyst who lives outside Cincinnati, has made a name for himself exposing marathon cheats on his blog, Marathon Investigation. During his racing days, he frequented online message boards about big races, which occasionally featured a high-profile cheating scandal. ""There was so much tension from those specific cases, I just wondered how many other people cheated,"" he said. Murphy is a former runner himself Murphy's investigative process has evolved since he first started looking at race results. He has gone from looking at missed split times in public race results to peering into other clues like suspiciously fast race times, starting line and finish line photos, and bystander video footage recorded at races. When Murphy heard about Cindy's speedy personal record, he started scrolling through the New York race photos looking for evidence that she had honestly run her improbably fast race. He didn't find any photos of the petite brunette running on the course. However, he did find a photo of a tall, athletically-built man running with Cindy's bib pinned to his shirt. After Murphy sent the photos and Cindy's former half-marathon times to the New York Marathon organisers andpublished a story on his blog,external, Cindy was disqualified. She is one of about 30 runners identified by Murphy who sought entry into the 2017 Boston Marathon using fabricated times. At least 15 of those runners were disqualified from showing up at the starting line in Hopkinton near Boston when the starting gun goes off on Monday. Some of the remaining 15 might get to run the race, but their results will be closely scrutinised. Murphy expects to identify many more people who cheated to get to Boston after the race is completed. Only the fastest amateur and elite runners can earn a spot in the iconic Boston Marathon. Men under 35 need a finish better than three hours and five minutes in an earlier marathon to earn a spot. Women under 35 have 30 extra minutes. While around 30,000 people are fast enough to run the marathon each year, more than 4,500 qualified runners were turned away in 2016 because too many people registered for the race. ""The integrity of the sport is enormously important to us, and to the athletes who run in our races,"" said a spokesperson for the Boston Athletic Association in an email statement. ""When it comes to qualifying for Boston, we rely on the race organisers and timing systems they employ to produce accurate results, and we also rely on the honesty and integrity of 99.99% of competitors who compete fairly in pursuit of their personal records."" Murphy said he thinks the actual number of cheaters is probably higher than the 0.01% cited by Marathon officials -  which would be just three people - but he thinks it is still a small percentage. Finding those rare cheats can be tough. ""There's no governing body for marathons per se to look at results,"" Murphy said. ""Most of the time race timers and directors definitely do care, but there's a lack of resources."" Could you run a marathon without training? Is a two-hour marathon possible? Cheating in a marathon can come in many forms. Some cut a few miles out of their qualifying race. Others give their racing bib to someone a bit faster. In rare cases, people pay to have their results altered. Most races have methods in place to detect the most obvious examples of cheating. The race bibs have tracking devices that log a runner's split time at mats placed strategically throughout the course. Sometimes missed mats and unbelievably quick splits will alert race officials to the foul play. But cheaters often slip across the finish line and into race results unnoticed by race timers. Some of these people claim amazing times - good enough to get into Boston. Mr Murphy has caught cheats by looking at the distances displayed on GPS watches in finish line photos and by matching finish times with time stamps on video recordings of races. When a runner whose qualifying time places them in an early corral position at the Boston Marathon but finishes in the back of the pack, Mr Murphy marks their race result as a priority for investigation. Often, if someone's Boston time is much slower than their qualifying time they may have cheated in an earlier race. Instead of looking back at runners after the Boston Marathon happens as he has in the past, this year Murphy tried to find people who cheated to qualify before race day. He hopes that more honest runners with qualifying times near the cut-off will be able to run the race because of his analysis. Not everyone agrees with Mr Murphy's methods. On the Marathon InvestigationFacebook page,external, sandwiched between encouraging comments, the occasional criticism pops up, taking the blog to task for going after amateur runners and giving them too much attention. Crews install the decal marking the finish line on Boylston Street Women's Running magazinepublished a critical opinion piece,externalarguing that novice runners who cheat should not make the news. Mr Murphy isn't always in the business of getting people disqualified from races. Sometimes, he does just the opposite. Last year, Ryan Lee ran the London Marathon in just over four hours and 13 minutes, but after he finished a race official contacted him to tell him that he was disqualified for missing a timing mat. The race organisers thought he had cut the course. One missed mat doesn't always mean someone cut a course - sometimes the mats don't cover the entire width of the course and a runner might accidentally run around it. But Mr Lee's time also seemed to be too fast - he appeared to catch up to runners who had started more than 15 minutes before him, very early in the race. ""It really was draining,"" Mr Lee said. ""I raised quite a bit of money for my chosen charity and I put 110% into the actual marathon. To be then called a cheat after that really does make you feel distraught."" Sign-up to get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning,external Mr Lee and his mother, Elizabeth Lee, set out to try and prove that he had run the entire race. They tracked down photos of Mr Lee on different points on the course and sought out other runners who had seen him race. But finding sufficient evidence to convince the race director that Mr Lee was innocent was difficult. ""I thought I would never be able to prove that I never did cheat,"" Mr Lee said. Mr Murphy heard about Mr Lee's case and began to look at the evidence - video footage of the race, photos, and Mr Lee's split times - and he noticed that Mr Lee appeared with runners who had a start time about 15 minutes before the London Marathon claimed he had started racing. Crucially, Mr Lee was photographed beside those other runners before race officials said he had crossed the starting line. Mr Murphy used these photos to prove that Mr Lee had actually started the race much earlier, and ultimately run a race about 15 minutes slower than the London Marathon had recorded. Derek Murphy - with his own proof of finishing a marathon Even with the missed mat at the 10km mark, Mr Lee's results made sense if his start time had been recorded incorrectly. When the race was presented with all of the evidence, they reinstated Mr Lee's official race times. Proving foul play on the race course often requires more than just number crunching. Mr Murphy said that Mr Lee's case is a great example of why he looks at more than just race times. ""I was able to vindicate somebody, but if I had just looked at the data, I would have thought he cheated,"" Mr Murphy said. Mr Lee still runs, in part because his racing record was cleared. He is planning to run the 2017 London Marathon later this month. ""I would love the do the marathon in America and meet Derek to say thank you for all the help."" Mr Lee said. ""Without the help, I would still be known as a cheat.""

"The NUT conference is being held in Cardiff There is no more familiar cry from a teaching union conference than ""Stop Education Cuts Now"". So often has it been heard from your typical tub-thumping delegate, that it has begun to sound a little like white noise. But this year, as teacher delegates met in Manchester and Cardiff for their annual conferences, something had changed. As more information has come to light about the state of school budgets, the message has resonated further. So what was once only emblazoned on delegates' T-shirts, has become a topic of polite dinner table conversation in many family homes. As Lewisham delegate Cleo Lewis put it with absolute clarity: ""I've had enough. It's just too much. Nothing is going to change by sitting around discussing."" The reality of significant cost pressures, in England's schools - ranging between 8% and 12%, depending on whom you believe - not to mention Â£3bn in efficiency savings, has penetrated parents' collective consciousness. This is in part due to theNUT/ATL school cuts website,externaland the attention the local press have given it, say the unions. Cleo Lewis delivered her message with clarity With web hits topping 400,000 and citations in more than 500 regional news stories, it has undoubtedly spread its message. The interactive website provides an estimate of how much each school stands to lose as a result of budget shortfalls and the new schools funding formula. Then it converts the figures into possible equivalent losses in teachers and support staff. It has prompted even the most measured of parents to burst into the playground and tell their friends: ""Apparently we're going to lose three teachers."" As a result parents, pushy and otherwise, have begun to mobilise alongside their children's teachers against what they see as unfair and unsustainable cuts. When quizzed by journalists on whether teachers would strike over the cuts, general secretary of the NUT, Kevin Courtney, appeared to suggest it would not be necessary. ""There's nothing unethical about striking against these cuts. There will be demands for that sort of action that come up in all sorts of places,"" he said. ""But what we are seeing is huge numbers of parental meetings, with hundreds of parents. These are significant mobilisations of people."" The biggest, for as long as he could remember, he said. And crucially, they are people not normally given to manning the barricades with placards and copies of the Socialist Worker stuffed in back pockets. Instead, they are people from ordinary hard-working families, to coin a phrase. Families, who may be starting to resent padding-out suffering school budgets. Take the Fair Funding for All Schools,externalfounder Jo Yurky, who addressed the NUT conference in Cardiff this weekend. The NUT has threatened strike action over funding cuts in England's schools The mother-of-two, and former Parliamentary ombudsman, confided that she was terrified of addressing delegates. ""I find it all a bit uncomfortable, public speaking,"" she told journalists, just minutes after making a rousing speech to the union. Her self-consciousness took nothing away from her message. In fact, it only added to it. But it was the content of her speech, and who she represents, that gives a new power to what the NUT and other teaching unions have been saying for some time. She described how schools have been asking parents to set up direct debits to plug huge deficits, sometimes amounting to several hundred thousand pounds. The claim rings true with parents who've had those begging letters home from head teachers explaining what difficult times their children's schools are facing. It provides a mirror image of the message head teachers have been setting out in open letters to their local papers, MPs and the education secretary over the last few months. As Ms Yurky puts it, when head teachers speak, parents listen. She expresses extreme frustration at the Department for Education's unwillingness to admit there is a problem, through its reiteration that school funding is at its highest ever level. TheDfE,external, however, is keen to show it is listening too. Ms Greening is keen to represent ""ordinary working families"" It says: ""We recognise that schools are facing cost pressures, and we will continue to provide support to help them use their funding in the most cost effective ways, so that every pound of the investment we make in education has the greatest impact."" But the parent campaigner goes on to say confidently; ""When parents speak politicians listen."" It is not clear yet whether Education Secretary Justine Greening will find some hidden resources in the education budget to alleviate the deepening cash problems ahead. Or whether she will turn to the chancellor and ask him for extra money ahead of the autumn statement. But what the NUT, and other teaching unions, say is certain is that their message is being heard far beyond the packed conference hall. Teachers threaten strike on school cuts Parents asked to fund school budgets Teachers head towards Sats boycott What should your kids learn at school?

"This video can not be played Razor sharp: Conquering a cut-throat world It looks like a barber's shop should. The scissors, the combs, the clippers and mirrors. Shelves of hair 'product' and jars of 'barbicide' disinfectant. There's a theme going on too - it screams motorcycles. From the leather jacket hanging on the wall, to oil and tyre paraphernalia, and biking photos. It's where men can come to relax. For a haircut, a beard trim, or even a full wet cut-throat razor shave. Welcome to the world of Sophie Collins: 'The Cut-throat Racer' She is a 25-year-old former hairdresser, who has swapped tints, blue-rinses and shampoo-and-sets in a small rural village in north Wales for the male-dominated world of barbering. It is four years since she set up shop in the quiet, picturesque Gwynedd village of Llanbedr - a place whose claims to fame are a campsite on the coast boasting it is the biggest in Europe, and an ex-Raf airfield that wants to become an international space port. But this spring, it is Sophie making the headlines in the village, in north Wales - and beyond. She has just been named the best cut-throat shaver in Wales - the first woman to take the title. It also means she'll become the very first female barber to make it to the UK finals of the competition, held in May in a boxing ring in Birmingham's National Exhibition Centre. ""I've always wanted to do it - be a barber,"" said Sophie. ""I was inspired by an old friend. A gentleman I trained with, he actually taught me how to shave. ""I thought, you know, when I took on my own place, I wanted to be like the other barbers - show myself off, show the shop - enter competitions - not thinking I'd get as far as have. ""I was quite shocked."" Perhaps she is being modest. She is no stranger to competing in traditionally male arenas. Outside of the barber shop, you are just as likely to find her donning racing leathers and taking her motorbike out on the track. She is spending the Easter weekend in a track competition where she will be up against her own father, who passed on his passion for speed and bikes to her. ""He's faster than me though,"" she laughed. At the race meets up and down the country, Sophie is also known to set-up her own mobile barber's shop, offering hardened bikers and race enthusiasts a trim or shave. It is where she picked-up her nickname: The Cut-throat Racer. And now she hopes her success can be an inspiration to other women who want to get into the industry. ""It's actually making the women out there think: 'You know what - I've always wanted to do it'. ""Maybe seeing myself win something like that, maybe it will encourage them to actually do it themselves - and not have to worry about being a woman taking part in a competition alongside men. ""Yes - it is daunting - but you're just as good as them, and that's how I felt on the day."" But does the swaggering confidence translate back to the barber shop floor? ""When they come in and I get the razor out to shave their neck, they panic,"" confesses Sophie. ""They tend to have a gulp and grit their teeth, and I'm trying to tell them: '""Relax - it's supposed to be relaxing for you. With a smile and a sly wink, she adds: ""A lot of them do get nervous. ""A woman with a razor? No - really?"" Yes really, a woman with a razor who is on a mission to become one of the best cut-throat shavers in Britain.

"Turkey has finished counting the votes in a crucial referendum - one which grants sweeping new powers to its controversial President, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Although opponents have questioned the result, the head of the country's electoral body says it is valid. Here's what the numbers say about the vote. The overall result is a narrow victory for Mr Erdogan - one small enough to be disputed by his opponents. But turnout for the divisive vote was high - 85%. And while a 51% victory may not seem like much, Turkey's large population means the Yes vote's margin is actually 1,124,091 votes. Turnout was also very high - reported at 85% by the country's Anadolu news agency. Opponents have been questioning the inclusion ofmore than one million unstamped ballot papersas valid - and await the verdict of international observers. During the campaign, much was made of the impact Turks living abroad, especially in Germany, might have on this crucial vote - particularly aftera diplomatic spat erupted over campaigning on foreign soil. In the end, though, just under 50% of the estimated 1.4 million Turks who could vote from Germany did so - and those who did were firmly in favour of granting Mr Erdogan his new powers. Several other countries also voted Yes, including: The Netherlands (70.94%) Austria (73.23%) Belgium (74.98%) France (64.85%) Most countries which returned a No vote had a relatively small number of voters - though Switzerland's 50,374 Turks firmly voted against (61.92%). The president of Germany's Turkish community expressed concern about the level of support for the Yes vote, saying they had to ""find ways of better reaching people who live in freedom in Germany and yet want autocracy for people in Turkey."" The vote may have been close, but the districts containing the country's three largest cities all voted against the president. In Istanbul, the largest city, and the capital, Ankara, the vote was very close. But in Izmir, the third-largest city, the margin was a much higher 68.8% No. But those results could not overpower Mr Erdogan's central Anatolian heartland. Many regions of the country's interior voted Yes, with the share often topping 70% in favour. Along the Aegean and in southeast Anatolia - which is home to many Kurds - most districts voted the other way, with up to 70% voting No. As the count progressed, Mr Erdogan's lead narrowed, but he retained enough - if only by a small percentage - to declare victory.

"Around 9% of adults in the UK say they download podcasts S-Town, the gripping saga about life and death in Alabama, is the latest podcast to have notched up impressive listening figures. But podcasts on the whole still don't seem to be breaking through to the mainstream. Have you ever downloaded a podcast? And, if so, did you actually listen to it? Podcasts have long been seen as the future of radio, a great way to pass the time on a long commute or catch up on a radio show you've missed. They've been growing in popularity since the early noughties, when Apple's iPod first hit the market (""podcast"" is a cross between the words ""iPod"" and ""broadcast""). But, 15 years on, they remain a relatively niche pursuit. ""I don't know whether podcasting is a mainstream proposition,"" says Matt Hill, co-founder of the British Podcast Awards. ""Its core strength at the moment is in narrowcasting. It creates audio content for niche groups of people, but it does so really effectively."" Podcasts have been growing in popularity over the last decade or so According toRajar,external, the body that monitors radio listening, 9% of adults in the UK say they download podcasts per week - around 4.7 million people. Which is a fair few - but not much compared with the 90% (or 48.7 million adults) who listen tolive radio,externalevery week. Kate Chisholm, radio critic for The Spectator, says: ""Podcasting is arguably something for metropolitan people, maybe in their 20s and 30s. ""I don't think it's something that particularly seeps out to the mainstream. On one level I would say that's changing, but then how many people who live on my street would be downloading podcasts? I'm not sure it would be very many. ""They'd listen to Classic FM or Radio 2... but a lot of people look at me blankly when I mention Serial."" A podcast is a piece of audio made available online, which the listener typically downloads to their smartphone or laptop They are very often speech-based because of restrictions on the use of commercial music Podcasts differ from live radio because you can choose to listen to them when you want, rather than in an allotted timeslot - kind of like how Netflix or iPlayer differ from live TV They can be bespoke specialist content or simply a downloadable version of a previously-broadcast radio show Serial, of course, is the biggest podcast success story to date -its makers say,externalit has had more than 250 million downloads. That certainly sounds like an impressive figure - albeit perhaps not as much as it might first seem. It doesn't mean 250 million different people have downloaded Serial, but rather that its 26 episodes have been downloaded a total of 250 million times. Plus, the RAJAR figuresshow,externalonly about two thirds of downloaded podcasts are actually listened to. Serial, hosted by Sarah Koenig, won a Peabody award in 2015 ""Serial made 2015 the year of the podcast,"" says Julia Furlan, podcast producer for BuzzFeed. ""Everybody was saying at that time that podcasting had finally made it, but it's still hard for a lot of people to find and download a podcast, hard to share it, it's still something we're figuring out as medium."" But, she says: ""Since Serial, you do see different names on the top 10 podcast chart, you see larger media companies and brands investing significant money in making new content. ""And I do think those are indicators that there is growth, that Serial did something really big."" S-Town, released in March and made by the team behind Serial, is the latest podcast to hit the headlines. The term ""podcast"" comes from ""iPod"" and ""broadcast"" The documentary begins with a suspected murder in Woodstock, Alabama, and unfolds around its central character - an eccentric local named John B McLemore. It wasdownloaded,external16 million times in its first week - although again that number is spread across seven episodes, which were all made available at once. Other recent podcast success stories include Russell Brand's new show on Radio X - which marked his return to radio after an eight-year absence. The high listening figures of the few breakthrough hits are what make podcasts a very attractive prospect to advertisers. Hill says: ""Even though the audiences are quite small, those shows do very well with advertisers because those listeners are interested in one specific area - it's exactly who they want to market to. ""Podcasting is starting to educate advertisers that there is an upmarket audience that would be interested in intelligent speech programming and would be happy to hear advertising alongside it."" Russell Brand's first podcast after his return to radio this month was hugely popular Many of these advertisers offer podcast listeners discount codes, because then they can monitor where their new customers are coming from. Which means many podcasts are effectively working on commission - and only become financially viable if companies can see a demonstrable boost in customers. But few podcasts become popular enough to attract advertisers at all. There are just so many of them around - with no quality control. ""I think podcasts are very different from mainstream broadcasting, it's like the difference between blogging and print,"" says Chisholm. ""Like blogs, the quality of podcasts is variable. There's a big difference between people who blog and people who actually get published."" Advertising is becoming more common on podcasts Part of the problem facing podcasts is that, in general, audio doesn't tend to go viral. Have a scroll down your Facebook feed, and the chances are there will be several videos of dogs, cats, babies, pranks, fails and Kermit the Frog memes. But people rarely share a great radio programme they've heard. ""The internet is a place that you take in with your eyes, it's a visual medium,"" Furlan says. ""I also think that downloading a podcast is quite hard, people think, 'Oh, I'm subscribed to this, what does that mean? How long is a season?' All of these things are unhelpful for the industry at large."" Desert Island Discs is one of the BBC's most popular podcasts With such a slow rate of growth, podcasts may become the minidisc of the radio industry - sold as the future but eventually becoming redundant. Or they may just take time to become established. ""Every year the listening figures creep up, but they haven't done a Netflix and exploded, it's slow burn,"" Hill says. ""But the thing about a slow burn is it's not a flash in the pan - those are the things that stick around."" Furlan goes further: ""I think absolutely podcasts will break through in the years to come. ""If you take into account how everybody has a smartphone now, smart cars are on their way, the more technology opens up, the more we are going to see podcasts in our daily lives.""

"Claire Foy has won awards for her portrayal of the Queen in the Netflix drama The Crown Netflix has come a long way since it started as a mail-order DVD rental service. It has largely been responsible for dragging television into the online world and its dozens of original productions such as House of Cards and Orange Is The New Black have helped it win a huge global audience. Last year its programming became available in another 130 countries, bringing the total to more than 190. But Netflix faces increasing competition from online rivals such as Amazon and Hulu, while television networks start to launch their own streaming services and make new shows available in binge-ready box sets. Sky Atlantic, for example, has made all six episodes of the new drama Guerrilla - starring Idris Elba, Freida Pinto and Babou Ceesay - available to stream, meaning viewers will not have to wait a week for their next fix. Freida Pinto and Babou Ceesay in the Sky Atlantic drama Guerrilla Growth of US subscriptions, which account for almost 60% of Netflix's revenue, has also slowed. Analysts and investors will closely watch its subscriber growth when results for the most recent quarter are released later on Monday. The company, whose shares have jumped almost 30% in the past 12 months to just over $140, is expected to report revenues of $2.5bn, with the subscriber total tantalisingly close to the 100 million mark. But some question how long Netflix can continue adding customers at the same pace. How will international expansion hold up? Netflix had more than 44 million international subscribers at the end of 2016, nearly 50% higher than the year before, as well as 49 million in the US. It expects to add another 4 million to the international total this quarter. Formerly sceptical analysts are increasingly confident that the firm can deliver. A consumer survey conducted for Jefferies bank in Germany and India turned up the surprising finding that services such as Netflix and Amazon are more appealing than local streaming options, despite potential language barriers. The survey also suggested that Netflix's pricing could hold up, even in a wider variety of markets. However, the company has warned that growth could be hurt if the dollar climbs much higher. Who is watching its shows? Robin Wright stars in House of Cards Netflix started making its own shows in 2013, with House of Cards one of its first big hits and Stranger Things more recently. The company plans to spend more on original content this year and reduce outlays on licensed material such as movies. Awards and critical acclaim for dramas such as The Crown have helped attract viewers. Yet analysts at Jefferies fear that cutting back on other content such as films could reduce Netflix's overall appeal. Will it be affected by the Hollywood writers dispute? Netflix casts a long shadow on the negotiations that started in March between the Writers Guild of America and production companies and studios over what writers are paid. The existing agreement expires on 1 May and a strike could be on the cards. One of the main sticking points concerns residual payments for streamed shows and writers for some Netflix productions are covered by the agreement. The growth of online television has also contributed to the rise of shorter series than on broadcast networks, which has meant lower fees for writers. Netflix stands to benefit from any disruption to major broadcasters. It also has flexibility to withstand a work stoppage, since it's not bound by the traditional TV calendar.

"This video can not be played How Brighton went from Football League survivors to Premier League promotion Championship leaders Brighton were promoted to the Premier League after they beat relegation-threatened Wigan, and Huddersfield then drew at Derby. Brighton had to wait on the result of the 17:00 BST kick-off at Pride Park, before their return to the top flight after 34 years was confirmed. Glenn Murray's crisp strike from the edge of the area put Albion ahead. Solly March slotted in a second after the break, before Nick Powell's header made it a nervy final five minutes. Brighton can now start preparing for life in the top division again following their relegation in 1982-83 and subsequent journey down and back up the leagues. A Huddersfield win would have meant the Seagulls needed one more point to mathematically guarantee promotion, but their goal difference was already far superior to the Terriers. Brighton need three more points to clinch the Championship title and will be crowned champions if they win at Norwich on Friday. Wigan put up a spirited defensive display at the Amex Stadium, but offered little going forward until Powell's goal, and now face the prospect of an immediate return to League One. They are five points from safety with three to play, including games against play-off chasing Reading and Leeds. Glenn Murray has scored 18 of his 22 Championship goals at home Brighton missed out on automatic promotion on the final day last season, when adraw at Middlesbroughsaw Boro go up with Burnley and Albion finish third on goal difference. They then lost in the play-off semi-finals to Sheffield Wednesday. But Chris Hughton's side have bounced back superbly this campaign, winning 28 of their 43 matches, including all five games in April so far and bettering last year's total of 89 points already. Attacking threat- Murray (22), Anthony Knockaert (15), Sam Baldock (11) and Tomer Hemed (11) have scored 59 of their 73 goals this season. Home form- The Seagulls have picked up the most Championship points at home with 54, and won 17 of their 22 games there. Unbeaten run- Brighton did not lose in October, November and December, winning 11 of their 15 games during that spell. Tight defence- They have conceded the fewest goals in the Championship (36) with 21 clean sheets. They could have beaten Wigan by an even bigger margin, but Murray saw his header ruled out and theChampionship's Player of the Year,Knockaert, had a goal chalked out for offside and a strike cleared off the line. This video can not be played Brighton promotion: Chris Hughton says he did not expect Seagulls to be in this position Brighton's promotion party comes almost 20 years to the day since they were less than 30 minutes from dropping out of the Football League. Trailing Hereford 1-0 on the final day of the 1996-97 season and needing a draw to survive, substitute Robbie Reinelt popped up in the 62nd minute to score an equaliser, Brighton held on and Hereford went down instead. Steve Gritt, who had taken charge five months earlier with Brighton 11 points adrift at the bottom of the fourth tier, said afterwards: ""It's not something I really want to go through again."" They never have. Brighton played at the Withdean Stadium between 1999 and 2011 However, the club was still in turmoil off the pitch in 1997. They had to sell the Goldstone Ground to pay off some of their debts, spent two seasons 70 miles away at Gillingham's Priestfield Stadium, and then moved into the Withdean Stadium in 1999 - a council-owned athletics track on the suburbs of Brighton. Chairman Tony Bloom's arrival eight years ago paved the way for their new permanent home and the success that followed, but it could have all been so different had they dropped into non-league. Of the 71 promoted teams to play in the Premier League, 31 have been immediately relegated. But Brighton fans may want to put a positive spin on it - more than half of them stay up. The average finishing position is 15th. Only twice have all three promoted teams stayed up - 2001-02 and 2011-12 - and only once have they all gone down - 1997-98. In recent years there has been an upturn in fortune for promoted sides. Since 2008-09, there has been only one season in which two of the three promoted clubs have gone straight back down (2014-15). In the five seasons prior to that, it happened four times (2003-04, 2004-05, 2006-07 and 2007-08). In their current squad, excluding loan players, only six boast previous Premier League experience - Murray, Knockaert, David Stockdale, Steve Sidwell, Shane Duffy and Liam Rosenior. But Hughton, who has won 63 of his 123 games in charge on the south coast, has managed in the top flight with Newcastle and Norwich. They are also in for a bumper payday, with promotion to the Premier League worth an estimated Â£170m. Brighton need three more points to guarantee the title Brighton manager Hughton told BBC Radio 5 live his players were up for the challenge of promotion straight away, despite the heartbreak of 2015-16: ""It had something to do with how the season ended last season, but I think it was more the fact that the players enjoyed being up that end of the table, competing, getting into the play-offs. ""I think it was a conscious decision that they wanted that again, and the signs were there early in the season. ""We recruited well early in the season, in the summer, but it was a real steely determination from the group of players that wanted to do it again."" Thousands of Brighton fans celebrated on the pitch at full-time Brighton boss Chris Hughton allowed himself a smile at the end of the game Brighton chairman Tony Bloom has invested heavily in the club since arriving in 2009 Seagulls goalkeeper David Stockdale is one of the few players in the squad with Premier League experience Football League survivors to Premier League.
