"Young women travelling to Syria to join Islamic State often end up ""domestically isolated in severe conditions"", new research claims. UK-led research suggests that the women do not join with the intention of becoming ""jihadi brides"", but often end up facing ""harsh realities"". The report also says the recruits are increasingly younger and come from comfortable and educated backgrounds. An estimated 4,000 Westerners have joined IS, including some 550 women. The joint report by the Institute for Strategic Dialogue and the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation at King's College London says women are far from passive agents, with some involved in aspects of IS life including propaganda and recruitment. But it suggests that, whatever women's reasons for joining IS, also known as Isis, their ""first and foremost"" responsibility will actually be ""to be a good wife to the jihadist husband to who they are betrothed and to become a mother to the next generation of jihadism"". Researchers have monitored more than 100 of the women through social media platforms and analysed interviews with those who have been arrested by security forces. Kadiza Sultana, Shamima Begum and Amira Abase are three of the teenage girls believed to have joined Islamic State The researchers say that although many young women join up with pre-conceived and often naive ideas, many are living with no electricity and little comfort and those who do marry jihadi men often face widowhood. The report says that though many women post photographs of themselves carrying guns, they are not allowed to fight and are confined to their homes with few managing to escape. Co-author Melanie Smith said: ""It gives a unique lens into the daily lives of foreign women living in the so-called Islamic State. ""Often through social media, we are able to read and hear about the complaints of daily life for females, often domestically isolated in severe conditions, and the realities of living within a war zone in a terrorist-held territory."" The report also says programmes aimed at preventing girls from joining IS are ""too few, ill-informed and under-resourced"". It concludes that the role of female mentors in prevention and de-radicalisation programmes is vital, but that more such mentors are needed. Shiraz Maher, senior research fellow at King's College London, said: ""Female recruits now make up a substantial part of those who have emigrated to join the Isis cause, but little has been done to properly investigate the reasons why they are joining and how to prevent them. ""This important piece of research will go some way to helping stem that tide."" How IS helps foreigners reach Syria Who are Britainâs jihadists?

"A review of the project said Â£43m of taxpayers' money had been spent A failed plan to build a bridge covered with trees and flowers over the River Thames in central London cost a total of Â£53m, it has been revealed. A Transport for London (TfL) inquiry showed the Garden Bridge Trust spent Â£161,000 on a website and Â£417,000 on a gala for the abandoned project. The design of the bridge cost more than Â£9m and the charity paid its executives Â£1.7m. Around Â£43m came from the public's pocket, TfL added. Doubts began to surround the project, overseen by Boris Johnson, after it lost the support of London Mayor Sadiq Khan in April 2017. It was officially abandoned in August of that year aftera review recommended it be scrapped. Some of the main expenditure on the failed project In July 2015, up to Â£60m of public funding was made available to the trust - Â£30m each from Transport for London (TfL) and the Department for Transport (DfT). TfL will now pay a final Â£5.5m of public money to the trust as part of the scheme's cancellation agreement, which the transport body said was 40% lower than what it could have been. The payout will help refund donors including Â£3,200 to the winner of a Garden Bridge auction prize who did not receive their promised game of ""table tennis with Boris Johnson"". Labour London Assembly member, Tom Copley AM, said: ""It's galling to see the costs of Boris' botched Bridge continuing to escalate for London's taxpayers. ""David Cameron needs to answer why, in his eagerness to see Boris Johnson's scheme go through, he intervened to overrule the advice of senior civil servants in order to extend the underwriting for the Bridge."" This was the tiara on the Thames that lost its shine and then died. The project promised a lot but delivered nothing, swallowing Â£43m of public money in the process. The biggest expenditure was the Â£21m contract to build the bridge - with campaigners still wanting to know why that was allowed when land had not even been secured. There is an incredible amount of detail in the recent Transport for London report: it cost Â£161k for a website and Â£417k for a gala fundraiser. Critics say the spending was gratuitous. And while many wanted the bridge, others did not. The questions won't stop here. Caroline Pidgeon, chair of the London Assembly's transport committee, said: ""The details of wasted money spent on the Garden Bridge project is the final confirmation of the utter folly of the project. ""The Garden Bridge Trust have squandered public money in a way no responsible charity should have behaved. ""No charity needs to spend Â£160,000 on a website or over Â£400,000 on a gala dinner."" Director of City Planning at TfL, Alex Williams, said: ""We worked to ensure that the cost to the public sector has been kept to a minimum. ""We have now confirmed the final payment legally required under the terms of the underwriting agreement made by the Government. This formally ends our involvement with the project.""

"This video can not be played Speaking at a Politico event, shadow chancellor John McDonnell called Churchill a ""villain"" Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell has called Sir Winston Churchill a ""villain"" over his role in dealing with striking miners in 1910. Asked at a Politico website event, for a one-word answer on whether Churchill was a hero or villain, he paused and replied: ""Tonypandy - villain"". The Tonypandy riots saw troops sent to control striking miners who wrecked shops and mine owners' property. The wartime PM was voted the greatest Briton in a BBC poll in 2002. His grandson Sir Nicholas Soames described Mr McDonnell's remark as ""a very foolish and stupid thing to say"". The Conservative MPtold The Telegraph,external: ""I think my grandfather's reputation can withstand a publicity-seeking assault from a third-rate, Poundland Lenin.

"John Henry Newman, who was born in 1801, was ordained as a priest in 1847 after converting to Catholicism Cardinal John Henry Newman is closer to being canonised after a second miracle in his name was confirmed by the Pope. Two authenticated miracles are required before sainthood and Newman, who was already credited with curing a man's spinal disease, is now said to have healed a woman's unstoppable bleeding. The Birmingham Oratory announced Pope Francis' decree with ""great joy"". Newman, born in 1801, will be the first English saint since the Forty Martyrs, executed under Reformation laws. Pope Benedict beatified John Henry Newman in Birmingham in 2010 The first miracle the Catholic convert from Birmingham is said by the Vatican to have performed was curing a deacon from Boston, Massachusetts,of a crippling spinal disease. Pope Francis has since decreed a second miracle, with Newman said to have healed a pregnant woman ""suffering from unstoppable internal bleeding"". How does someone become a saint? Cardinal Newman's 'miracle cure' Latest news and updates from the West Midlands Newman wasbeatified in 2010 by Pope Benedictbefore tens of thousands of people in his home city of Birmingham after the first miracle was recognised. Newman founded the Birmingham Oratory in Edgbaston which is still in use today During his life, Newman was a respected religious scholar, who spent much of his time helping the poor and sick. The last English canonisations were in 1970 of the Forty Martyrs of England and Wales, a group of Catholics who were executed between 1535 and 1679 under laws enacted during the English Reformation. The process cannot begin until at least five years after the candidate's death and involves scrutinising evidence of his or her holiness and work. First, the individual is declared a ""servant of God"" He or she is then called ""venerable"" Beatification: an individual is declared blessed after a miracle is attributed to him or her Canonisation: The candidate becomes a saint after a further Vatican-authenticated miracle Archbishop of Westminster Cardinal Vincent Nichols, who is head of the Catholic Church in England, said Newman was ""deeply admired"", particularly by the people of Birmingham who ""lined the streets"" when he died. The former Archbishop of Birmingham added that the announcement of Newman's pending canonisation was ""wonderful news"". Birmingham Oratory, the community founded by Newman in 1849, said the confirmation of his ""heroic sanctity will be welcomed by Catholics and Anglicans alike"".

"Female tiger Melati was killed last week by potential mate, Asim, during their first introduction Zoos in Britain should be brought under a ""centralised licensing"" system, an animal charity has said following the deaths of two tigers in the last week. A female tiger at London Zoo was killed by a potential mate and another died after tigers fought at a safari park. The Born Free Foundation says the zoo licensing rules currently overseen by local authorities have ""differences in understanding and application"". The zoo trade body says the tiger deaths were unrelated to licensing. The Born Free Foundation, which campaigns to keep wildlife in the wild, says that ""significant incidents occur with disturbing frequency"" at zoos. It says it has logged 33 incidents since 2016, including thedeath of eight Humboldt penguinsfollowing a ""urban fox"" attack and anescaped snow leopard which was shotafter a zookeeper left an enclosure door open. The charity's head of animal welfare and captivity, Chris Draper, says ""licensing and inspection of zoos in Britain is currently the responsibility of the large number of local authorities"". This leaves thelaw,external""open to interpretation"", he said. The professional body which represents more than 100 zoos and aquariums says it was ""saddened to hear of the deaths of two female tigers at two of its member collections in recent days"". But the British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquariums (BIAZA) rejects Born Free's call for changes to licensing, saying the events must not overshadow the important conservation work undertaken by its members. ""BIAZA welcomes robust zoo licensing and endorses recent steps taken by Defra [Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs] to strengthen the zoo licensing process in the UK,"" a spokeswoman added. Anendangered female Sumatran tiger was killedby a potential mate during their first introduction at London Zoo on 8 February. The zoo saidstaff used air horns and fire extinguishersto stop the male tiger, Asim, from killing Melati. However, despite the best efforts of the vets, 10-year-old Melati died. Thirteen-year-old female tiger Shouri had lived at the park since 2006 On Monday, arare Amur tiger died in a fightwith two other tigers at Longleat Safari and Adventure Park in Wiltshire. The park said 13-year-old female Shouri was killed after gaining access to a paddock where two other tigers, Red and Yana, were being held. A fight took place between the three animals. The park said a full investigation was ongoing to determine the exact circumstances surrounding the ""terribly sad event"". There are thought to be only 300 Sumatran tigers and 540 Amur tigers left in the wild. A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, said: ""The UK has some of the highest animal welfare standards in the world. ""The current licensing regime for zoos is enforced by local authorities, but they are regularly inspected by trained professionals against our high standards. ""These standards are developed together with leading animal welfare experts on our Zoos Expert Committee.""

"Theresa May has played down reports that she could force MPs to choose between backing her deal or accepting a delay to EU withdrawal. ITV News said,externalchief UK negotiator Olly Robbins was overheard in a Brussels bar saying the EU was likely to allow an extension to the Brexit process. The PM suggested MPs should not rely on ""what someone said to someone else as overheard by someone else, in a bar"". ""It is very clear the government's position is the same,"" she said. ""We triggered Article 50 (the process by which the UK leaves the EU)... that had a two-year time limit, that ends on the 29 March. ""We want to leave with a deal, and that's what we are working for."" Prime Minister's Questions: The verdict No-deal Brexit plan for Channel Tunnel Kuenssberg: Will May delay vote to last minute? Commons Live: MPs discuss trade deals The prime minister has said she will lift the requirement for a 21-day period before any vote to approve an international treaty, which means she could delay the final Brexit vote until days before the UK is due to leave the EU. No 10 insists Mrs May still plans to hold a vote on a deal as soon as possible but Labour has accused her of ""running down the clock"" in an effort to ""blackmail"" MPs into backing her deal. And European Council President Donald Tusk tweeted that ""no news is not always good news"", saying the EU was ""still waiting for concrete, realistic proposals from London"". Allow Twitter content?

At Prime Minister's Questions, the SNP's Westminster Leader Ian Blackford urged Mrs May to rule out holding a ""meaningful vote"" on the deal with less than two weeks to go until Brexit. ""The prime minister must stop playing fast and loose - businesses are begging for certainty,"" he said. Mrs May said the way to give businesses certainty was to back the deal she had negotiated with the EU. But Mr Blackford told her she had been ""rumbled by your own loose-lipped senior Brexit adviser"". It was a reference to the ITV report that Mr Robbins was overheard saying he expected MPs to be presented with a choice of backing either a reworked withdrawal deal, or a potentially significant delay to Brexit. MPs rejected the deal negotiated with the EU by a historic margin in January and the prime minister says she is seeking legally-binding changes to the controversial ""backstop"" - the ""insurance policy"" aimed at avoiding a return to border checks between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer says MPs would force the PM to delay Brexit, rather than accept a no-deal scenario The UK is currently due to leave the EU on 29 March, whether or not a deal has been approved by the Commons. On Wednesday, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn pointed to thedecision to scrap a no-deal Brexit contract with a ferry company that had no shipsas a ""spectacular failure"" which was ""a symptom of the utter shambles of this government and its no-deal preparations"". He described the prime minister's Brexit strategy as ""costly, shambolic and deliberately evasive"". Mrs May accused Mr Corbyn of preferring ""ambiguity and playing politics to acting in the national interest"" saying MPs did not know if he backed another referendum, a deal or Brexit. ""People used to say he was a conviction politician - not any more,"" she said. The PM has promised to return to the Commons on 26 February with a further statement - triggering another debate and votes the following day - if a deal has not been secured by that date. If a deal is agreed, MPs will have a second ""meaningful vote"", more than a month after Mrs May's deal was rejected in the first one. No 10 has indicated it is willing to make concessions on protection for workers but Labour's push for a closer future customs relationship than Mrs May proposes, remains a sticking point. Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer met Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington and Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay on Wednesday for what he described as ""frank and serious discussions"". But he said he was given ""no suggestion"" that the prime minister was ""diluting red lines"". He added that he had ""set out the Labour Party position, which is the two options: On one hand a close economic relationship, on the other a public vote"". He said the battle for now is ""to stop the prime minister running down the clock"". Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell has acknowledged that the prime minister cannot back Labour's Brexit proposals, and said he thinks Parliament is going to end up taking over the Brexit process. Asked at a Politico event on Wednesday how Labour was going to achieve its plans, including staying in a customs union, because, ""you know she can't back it... she'll split her party"", Mr Donnell replied: ""Yeah... yeah"". ""I genuinely think we're now into hard-nosed negotiations between pockets of support in all the different politics,"" he said. He accepted that the general election Labour has been calling for was ""unlikely"". Labour has tabled an amendment for Thursday that would force the government to come back to Parliament by the end of the month to hold a substantive vote in the Commons on its plan for Brexit. ""Our amendment says there should be a hard stop on February 26. The prime minister must either put up her deal or allow Parliament to take control,"" said Sir Keir.

Mrs May told MPs on Tuesday she was discussing a number of options with the EU to secure legally-binding changes to the backstop, including replacing it with ""alternative arrangements"", putting a time limit on how long it can stay in place, or a unilateral exit clause so the UK can leave it at a time of its choosing. MPs are due to vote again on the Brexit process on Thursday in what was expected to be a routine procedure acknowledging the government's efforts. Please upgrade your browser However, BBC political editor Laura Kuenssbergtweeted,externalthat Mrs May could be faced with another defeat, with influential Brexiteers from the European Research Group of Tory backbenchers indicating that they will refuse to back the government. They are angry at being asked to support the PM's motion, which combines the view backed by a majority of MPs last month that the government should seek an alternative to the backstop with a separate move to stop Brexit happening without a formal deal. How MPs aim to alter Brexit process Brexit: What could happen next? Brexit: A really simple guide The group's deputy chairman, Mark Francois, told the BBC members had ""pleaded"" with Downing Street to change the wording, which he said goes back on what she has previously told MPs. ""We cannot vote for this as it is currently configured because it rules out no deal and removes our negotiating leverage in Brussels."" Most MPs want to avoid a no-deal scenario, fearing chaos at ports and disruption to business. However, some Brexiteers have played down that prospect arguing it is an example of ""Project Fear"". Meanwhile, Labour have highlighted a government risk assessment that says ""precisely four"" of about 40 documents designed to replicate the existing 40 EU free trade agreements have been signed. The party's trade spokesman Barry Gardiner said of the agreements, which were promised to be ready immediately after Brexit: ""Nine are off-track, 19 significantly off-track, four are not possible to be completed by March 2019 and two are not even being negotiated."" International Trade Secretary Liam Fox responded: ""A number of negotiations are at an advanced stage. As with all international negotiations, and indeed any negotiations, they will go down to the wire."" Will PM delay vote to last minute?

"Ms Begum was 15 when she left the UK in 2015 One of three schoolgirls who left east London in 2015 to join the Islamic State group says she has no regrets, but wants to return to the UK. In an interview with the Times,external, Shamima Begum, now 19,  talked about seeing ""beheaded heads"" in bins - but said that it ""did not faze her"". Speaking from a refugee camp in Syria, she said she was nine months pregnant and wanted to come home for her baby. She said she'd had two other children who had both died. She also described how one of her two school friends that had left the UK with her had died in a bombing. The fate of the third girl is unclear. Families flee last IS village in Syria After the caliphate: Has IS been defeated? London schoolgirl 'feared dead in Syria' Bethnal Green Academy pupils Ms Begum and Amira Abase were both 15, while Kadiza Sultana was 16, when they left the UK in February 2015. They flew from Gatwick Airport to Turkey after telling their parents they were going out for the day. They later crossed the border into Syria. This video can not be played Anthony Loyd of the Times describes how he found Shamima Begum in a Syrian refugee camp After arriving in Raqqa, she stayed at a house with other newly arrived brides-to-be, she told the Times. ""I applied to marry an English-speaking fighter between 20 and 25 years old,"" she said. Ten days later she married a 27-year-old Dutch man who had converted to Islam. She has been with him since then, and the couple escaped from Baghuz -  the group's last territory in eastern Syria - two weeks ago. Her husband surrendered to a group of Syrian fighters as they left, and she is now one of 39,000 people in a refugee camp in northern Syria. Asked by Times journalist Anthony Loyd whether her experiences of living in the one-time IS stronghold of Raqqa had lived up to her aspirations, Ms Begum said: ""Yes, it did. It was like a normal life. The life that they show on the propaganda videos - it's a normal life. ""Every now and then there are bombs and stuff. But other than that..."" She said that seeing her first ""severed head"" in a bin ""didn't faze me at all"". ""It was from a captured fighter seized on the battlefield, an enemy of Islam. ""I thought only of what he would have done to a Muslim woman if he had the chance,"" she said. ""I'm not the same silly little 15-year-old schoolgirl who ran away from Bethnal Green four years ago,"" she told Mr Loyd. ""I don't regret coming here."" Shamima Begum was legally a child when she pinned her colours to the Islamic State mast. And if she were still under 18 years old, the government would have a duty to take her and her unborn child's ""best interests"" into account in deciding what to do next. But she's now an apparently unrepentant adult - and that means she would have to account for her decisions, even if her journey is a story of grooming and abuse. AnotherBritish jihadi bride, Tareena Shakil,who got out of the war zone with her child, lied to the security services on her return and was jailed for membership of a terrorist group. If Ms Begum got out of the country, that is the kind of charge she could face - along with encouraging or supporting terrorism. But that's a long way off. Assuming she made it to an airport, the UK could temporarily ban her from returning until she agreed to be investigated, monitored and deradicalised. Social services would also certainly step in to consider whether her child should be removed to protect him or her from radicalisation. Watch: The background to the case of Tareena Shakil But Ms Begum said the ""oppression"" had come as a ""shock"" and said she felt the IS ""caliphate"" was at an end. ""I don't have high hopes. They are just getting smaller and smaller,"" she said. ""And there is so much oppression and corruption going on that I don't really think they deserve victory."" She referred to her husband having been held in a prison where men were tortured. Kadiza Sultana, Amira Abase and Shamima Begum (l-r) in photos issued by police A lawyer for the family of Kadiza Sultana said in 2016 that she was believed to have been killed in a Russian air strike. Ms Begum told the Times her friend had died in a bombing on a house where there was ""some secret stuff going on"" underground. She added: ""I never thought it would happen. At first I was in denial. Because I always thought if we got killed, we'd get killed together."" Ms Begum said losing two children ""came as a shock. It just came out of nowhere, it was so hard"". Her first child, a girl, died at the age of one year and nine months, and was buried in Baghuz a month ago. Her second child - the first to die - died three months ago at the age of eight months, of an illness that was compounded by malnutrition, the Times reports. She told the paper she took him to a hospital. ""There were no drugs available, and not enough medical staff,"" she said. As a result she said she was ""really overprotective"" of her unborn child. She said this concern also contributed to her decision to leave Baghuz. ""I was weak,"" she said. ""I could not endure the suffering and hardship that staying on the battlefield involved. ""But I was also frightened that the child I am about to give birth to would die like my other children if I stayed on."" She said she remained scared her unborn baby would become ill in the refugee camp. ""That's why I really want to get back to Britain because I know it will be taken care of - health-wise, at least,"" she said. She said she should be giving birth ""any day now"". ""I'll do anything required just to be able to come home and live quietly with my child."" Tasnime Akunjee, a lawyer who was instructed by the Bethnal Green girls' families after they ran away, said the families had told him they now wanted ""time and space to process what's happened"". This video can not be played Shamima's sister Renu Begum addressed her in her appeal: ''We love you more than anybody could love you'' Security minister Ben Wallace said he could not comment on Ms Begum's case for legal reasons but said any Britons who had gone to Syria to engage or support terrorist activities should be prepared to be questioned, investigated and potentially prosecuted if they came back to the UK. He said there was no consular assistance in Syria so any Briton wanting help would need to find consular services elsewhere in the region. Asked whether the government would be rushing to bring home people such as Ms Begum, he said: ""I'm not putting at risk British people's lives to go and look for terrorists or former terrorists in a failed state."" He added that while the UK had a duty of care to children of Britons in Syria, he also had a duty towards all UK citizens and would do what was ""proportionate and necessary"" to keep people safe. Sir Peter Fahy, a retired senior police chief who led the Prevent terrorism prevention programme at the time the girls ran away, said he could understand why the government was ""not particularly interested"" in facilitating her return. ""If the woman was showing complete remorse, it would be completely different,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. It would cost a ""vast amount of money"" and the biggest challenge would be for local police to keep her safe and ensure she did not become a lightning rod for both right-wing extremists and Islamic extremists, he added. Dal Babu, a former Metropolitan Police Chief Superintendent, said it should be remembered that Ms Begum was groomed as a child to become a radicalised woman and was a ""victim of brainwashing"". IS has lost control of most of the territory it overran, including its strongholds of Mosul, in Iraq, and Raqqa, in Syria. However, fighting continues in north-eastern Syria, where the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) say they captured dozens of foreign fighters in recent weeks.

"As wetalked about late on Monday, there has been a sense building in Westminster that the prime minister is, maybe by accident, maybe increasingly by design, looking to almost the last possible minute for the definitive Brexit vote. While ministers speak publicly of ""talks"" that must be given time to be completed with the EU, and officials continue to chew over the possibility ofthe ""Malthouse compromise""(remember that? It already seems like months ago that it emerged, blinking, into the Brexit saga) more and more MPs believe it is displacement activity - ministers keeping outwardly busy while they run down the clock. Early on Tuesday morning, Commons leader Andrea Leadsom did not exactly quash that notion in an interview with the Today programme. She appeared to open up the possibility that MPs might in the end be asked to vote at a moment of peak jeopardy, and that ministers might be willing to let the matter run that long. Then, on Tuesday afternoon, the prime minister herself hinted that the government was prepared to do that. May asks MPs for more time on Brexit deal Brexit: Are we running out of time? Brexit: What could happen next? Brexit: A really simple guide She was answering a technical question about the CRAG (the constitutional reform and governance bill before you ask, Brexit is nothing if not replete with acronyms). For ages, the existence of that bill has built a theoretical pause between a vote on the deal, and our actual departure from the EU. But today the prime minister said that process could be put on fast forward. So, in practice, if she wants to push this vote later, and later, then only to the very last minute (and remember the EU doesn't want to budge until then), that bit of legislation might not be a block, because if MPs approve it, she can get round it. That's always a bigif, of course, but it certainly suggests that the government can at least foresee a situation where they have to take dramatic last-minute action, whatever the existing law says. What's also emerging though is how former Remainers want to stop that happening. They won't be using up their energy this week on votes that might not get anywhere. But their concerns have pushed the PM now to promise a vote will take place on 27 February. And there will be another go from the prominent Labour frontbencher Yvette Cooper, working with backing from Tories like Sir Oliver Letwin and Nick Boles. They will again try to force through legislation that would delay Brexit if the government can't get a deal done in time, removing the possibility of that last-minute kamikaze choice. But that will only work if enough Tory Remainers are ready to vote with them. And the way the numbers stack up, that probably has to mean ministers being ready to quit. One member of the government told me on Tuesday: ""They have to realise that is it - and if no senior member of the cabinet is willing to do it, then we're heading for that terrible choice."" Another minister, one of those who is thinking about departure, said: ""I have to look the PM in the eye and ask what she is really willing to do. But for a number of us it's party versus country, and the Tories don't do well if we put ourselves before the public."" Some of those organising the push to take the March ""deal or no deal"" choice off the table believe there are at least 10 government ministers who would be ready to quit. Maybe so. On past evidence, ministers who see themselves as moderate and pragmatic hang back in the end. But the end of February really does seem to be the last moment where they could do more to stop no deal than just pass a resolution the government could then ignore. If they are not willing to give up their ministerial red boxes on 27 February, their chance really will have gone.

"Theresa May went head-to-head with Jeremy Corbyn in the House of Commons. Here's what happened. Jeremy Corbyn threw the prime minister a Brexit curveball at this session. Most observers were expecting the PM to get a grilling over reported comments by her chief Brexit adviser Olly Robbins - but the Labour leader went after Transport Secretary Chris Grayling instead. He focused all six of his questions on the ""fiasco"" of the Seaborne Freight contract. The ferry company with ""no ships and no trading history"" has had its contract to provide servicesin the event of a no-deal Brexit cancelled. Mr Corbyn said this was symbolic of the government's ""costly, shambolic and evasive"" handling of Brexit. ""What went wrong?,"" he asked the prime minister. This video can not be played PM says there was ""due diligence"" over its ferry plan, but Jeremy Corbyn is ""impressed"" she can ""keep a straight face"". Mrs May said 90% of the ferry contracts awarded in case of a no-deal Brexit scenario, went to DFDS and Brittany Ferries. ""Due diligence was carried out on all of these contracts,"" she told the Labour leader. The transport secretary had told MPs the decision to award a contract to Seaborne Freight ""had no cost to the taxpayer"", said Mr Corbyn, but the National Audit Office found that Â£800,000 had been spent on external consultants to assess the bid. Could the prime minister ""correct the record""? Mrs May said Mr Corbyn was ""late to the party"" because she had been asked about this yesterday by the SNP. ""Labour following the SNP, well whatever next,"" sniped the PM before repeating her line about ""proper due diligence"". Mr Corbyn said Freedom of Information requests showed Chris Grayling had ""bypassed"" the rules which allow normal scrutiny of a deal. Mrs May said the Seaborne Freight contract had been handed out following individual assessments by consultants, and no money had been paid to Seaborne Freight. It was ""entirely right and proper"" to make sure that the government was preparing for any no-deal Brexit, she added. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Corbyn said taxpayers were facing a Â£1m legal bill for contesting Eurotunnel's court case against the government over its ""secretive and flawed"" no-deal transport contracts process. Not only that, he told MPs, Thanet Council, in Kent, was facing a Â£2m budget deficit as a result of the Seaborne Freight debacle. Could the PM offer ""cast iron guarantees"" that the people of Thanet would not be hit with this bill? Mrs May said Department of Transport officials were ""in discussions"" with Thanet council. The ferry contracts were about safeguarding medical supplies in the event of a no-deal Brexit, she added. Mr Corbyn said the prime minister should follow the advice of the House and take no deal off the table and ""negotiate seriously with the EU"". He broadened out his attack on Chris Grayling, for ""ignoring warnings"" about drones at airports, ignoring warnings about the collapse of outsourcing giant Carillion, overseeing the ""disastrous"" new rail time tables, and rail fare increases. And now, said Mr Corbyn, Mr Grayling was in charge of a ""vital aspect of Brexit planning"". ""How on earth"" could the prime minister have any confidence in him? Allow Twitter content?

Mrs May replied that rail investment was at its highest since the Victorian era and that was 20% higher every year on average than under Labour. She had clearly come armed with attack lines for Mr Corbyn over his Brexit strategy, so she unloaded them all as their exchange came to an end, accusing the Labour leader of ""ambiguity"" and ""playing politics"" and of failing to say whether he wanted Brexit, or a second referendum. People no longer say he is a ""conviction politician"", she concluded. The SNP's leader at Westminster Ian Blackford said that with 44 days to go until Brexit, Mrs May must stop ""playing fast and loose"" with the economy.

This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May tell MPs they are both old enough to remember the 1966 World Cup Here is BBC Parliamentary Correspondent Mark D'Arcy's take Both the main players at PMQs had one of their better days, proving, I suppose, that it's not a zero-sum game, where one of them must do badly for the other to do well. Jeremy Corbyn continued Labour's recent targetting of the Transport Secretary, Chris Grayling, with a series of detailed questions about the Seabourne Ferries saga. It was an old school piece of PMQs questioning, building up an attack over a series of questions, which saw the PM digging into her file for the pre-scripted answers. She, in turn, was at her most effective when she counter-attacked on Labour's policy ambiguity over Brexit, with a particularly wounding line that Jeremy Corbyn was losing his reputation as a conviction politician. It was also notable that the Conservative benches were rather muted during the attacks on their transport secretary. Perhaps the accumulated weight of the railway timetables saga, the Gatwick drones and even his policies as justice secretary have depressed backbench support? So maybe the attack was a tactical success for Mr Corbyn, but was it also a strategic missed opportunity? Brexiteer Tories rather tiptoed around the reported remarks of the PM's Brexit advisor, Olly Robbins, overheard in a Brussels bar. But the twin suggestions attributed to him, of a postponement of Brexit day and of the Northern Ireland backstop being a ""bridge"" to a post-Brexit customs union with the EU, cause them deep alarm. Mr Corbyn did not seek to deepen it further, even though it would have been quite easy to segue from Grayling to Robbins, and it was left to the SNP's Ian Blackford and later the Conservative Henry Smith, to target the alleged bar-room indiscretion. The PM's elegant prepared response: ""What someone said to someone else, overheard by someone elseâ¦in a bar"" was eventually deployed in answer to Mr Smith, but was probably drafted with Mr Corbyn in mind. The other big PMQs player, John Bercow, had a quiet time. His rebukes were genial, even jovial, and no-one was bruised by them. He even indulged a few spurious points of order at the end, although I'm not sure how grateful Ian Blackford will have been for his colleague Mharie Black's complaint that when her leader rose to ask his question, lots of MPs immediately got up and left the Chamber. Elsewhere, there were interesting responses to well placed questions from Tories Robert Halfon (on school exclusions) and George Freeman (Sir Philip Greene's knighthood) and to Labour's Chris Evans (on suicide and self harm images on social media) with the PM keen to demonstrate that her government is not so fixated on Brexit that it can't deal with other issues.

"Unions says Ford aims to cut 1,000 jobs at Bridgend by 2021 Ford has said a no-deal Brexit would be catastrophic for the firm's manufacturing operations in the UK and that it would do ""whatever is necessary"" to protect its business. The comments come after a report the carmaker was stepping up preparations to move production out of the UK. Ford declined to comment directly on The Times' report, but said it had long warned against a ""hard Brexit"". The company is the latest carmaker to warn on the risks of a no-deal Brexit. ""Such a situation would be catastrophic for the UK auto industry and Ford's manufacturing operations in the country,"" the company said in a statement. ""We will take whatever action is necessary to preserve the competitiveness of our European business."" 1,000 Bridgend Ford job cuts outlined Jaguar Land Rover confirms 4,500 job cuts Toyota urges support for PM's Brexit deal Ford employs 13,000 people in the UK at sites in Bridgend, Dagenham, Halewood and Dunton. According to The Times' report,external, the firm told Prime Minister Theresa May on a telephone call with business leaders that it was preparing alternative sites abroad. During the call Mrs May confirmed reports that the government was preparing a package of financial support for businesses affected by a no-deal Brexit but declined to elaborate, The Times said. Other companies on the call delivered the same warning as Ford, the report said. Ford is the latest carmaker to sound the alarm on Brexit after Nissan said last week it would no longer build its X-Trail car in Sunderland, in part because of Brexit uncertainty. In January, Jaguar Land Rover, the UK's biggest carmaker, said it would cut 4,500 jobs in the UK, citing geopolitical issues, regulatory disruptions, and Brexit uncertainty. Toyota has also urged the government to avoid a no-deal scenario. In addition to Brexit worries, the car industry faces a slump in sales of diesel cars and a slowdown in China. Last month, the Unite union saidFord aimed to cut almost 1,000 jobs at its Bridgend plant by 2021because of challenging market conditions. The carmaker declined to confirm the figures but said it was consulting with unions. The government has said the best way to provide certainty to industry is for MPs to back the prime minister's Brexit deal.

"The FBI released Samuel Little's drawings in the hope that the victims could be identified. The FBI has released the portraits a serial killer drew of his victims in the hope that they can be identified. Samuel Little, 78, confessed to killing 90 people over three decades last year, while already serving three life sentences for murder. The killings took place across the US between 1970 and 2005. Investigators say he targeted ""marginalised and vulnerable women"", and that some of their bodies went unidentified and deaths uninvestigated. Having heard all of his confessions, they believe he could be one of the most prolific serial killers in US history. Los Angeles, California: 'White female between 23-25 years old killed in 1996' 'White female killed in 1984. Met victim in Columbus, Ohio. Body disposed of somewhere in Northern Kentucky' Little, a former competitive boxer, would knock his victims out with punches before strangling them - meaning that there were not always ""obvious signs"" that the person had been killed. Now, they are hoping that Little's drawings can help them to finally find out who the victims were so that their families can be notified. ""With no stab marks or bullet wounds, many of these deaths were not classified as homicides but attributed to drug overdoses, accidents, or natural causes,"" the FBI said in its initial report in November last year. 'White female between 20-25 years old killed in 1972. Victim possibly from Massachusetts' 'Black female, age 26, killed between 1976 and 1979. Met victim in St. Louis, Missouri. Victim possibly called Jo' Although Little has been convicted of three murders, the FBI believes that he is responsible for many more. Little was first caught in 2012 when he was arrested on a drugs charge in a homeless shelter in Kentucky, and extradited to California. Once he was in police custody in Los Angeles, officers carried out DNA testing on him. The results linked him to three unsolved murders from 1987 and 1989, which were all in Los Angeles County. He pleaded not guilty at trial, but was eventually convicted and sentenced to three consecutive life sentences, with no chance of parole. 'Black female between 28-29 years old killed in 1984. Victim picked up in Memphis, Tennessee' Houston, Texas: 'Black female between 25-28 years old killed between 1976 and 1979 or in 1993' His three known victims were beaten and strangled, before their bodies were dumped in alleyways or bins. Before being convicted of murder Little had already built up an extensive criminal record, with offences from armed robbery to rape in a number of different states across the US. US serial killer 'confesses to 90 murders' Why was there a spike in serial killers? Little's case was passed on to the FBI's Violent Criminal Apprehension Programme (ViCAP), which analyses people who serially commit violent and and sexual crimes. They then share their findings with local law enforcement in different areas, in order to check them against any unsolved crimes. ViCAP, tasked with doing a full background check on Little, noticed that the three LA killings were very similar to a number of unsolved deaths dating back to the 1970s. 'Black female between 35-45 years old killed in 1977. Met the victim in Gulfport, Mississippi. Victim possibly from Pascagoula. Victim possibly worked at Ingalls Shipyard.' 'Black female killed in 1976 or 1977. Body disposed of somewhere outside Wichita Falls (city unspecified).' Crime analyst Christina Palazzolo writes on the FBI website that they ""found a case out of Odessa, Texas, that sounded very much like him, and we could place him passing through the area around the same time"". In spring last year, investigators set up an interview with Little, hoping to find out more information. Knowing that he wanted to move prisons, they struck a deal - he could move prisons if he talked. Then, during the interview, Ms Palazzolo says ""he went through city and state and gave [us] the number of people he killed in each place"". Once he was done, he had confessed to 90 killings. The FBI says it has so far been able to verify 34 of these. Many of Little's victims were sex workers, people with substance abuse issues and trans women, whose deaths may not have been investigated or would have been ruled to be accidental at the time. His memory of the killings was mostly precise, as he could give details about where they happened and what car he was driving.  But he was unable to remember specific dates - which, investigators say, has caused further issues with identifying the victims. Agents are continuing to question Little and collect drawings of his victims. Other images are described as: Las Vegas, Nevada: 'Black female, age 40, killed in 1993' Monroe, Louisiana: 'Black female, age 24, killed between 1987 and the early 1990s' 'Phoenix, Arizona: 'White female killed in 1997. Victim possibly called Ann' White female, age 26, killed in 1983 or 1984. Victim possibly from Griffith, Georgia' Atlanta, Georgia: 'Black female between 23-25 years old killed in 1984. Victim possibly a college student' 'Hispanic female in her 40s. Killed in 1988 or 1996. Victim possibly from Phoenix' Atlanta, Georgia: 'Black female between 35-40 years old killed in 1981' Miami, Florida: 'Black [trans female], age 18, killed in 1971 or 1972. Victim possibly called Mary Ann or Marianne' US serial killer 'confesses to 90 murders' Why was there a spike in serial killers?

"The body of an 80-year-old man was found in a house in Bonhay Road A man has been arrested on suspicion of murder after three men in their 80s - two of whom were believed to have been twins - were found dead. The bodies of two 84-year-olds, named locally as Dick and Roger Carter, were found in Exeter on Tuesday, a day after the body of an 80-year-old man was discovered. Police said the level of violence used against all three had led them to link the deaths. A 27-year-old man is in police custody. Officers were first called to Bonhay Road at 15:00 GMT on Monday, where they found the body of the 80-year-old. At 13:00 on Tuesday, police attended a property in Cowick Lane, about 1.5 miles (2.4km) away, and discovered the bodies of the two other men. Latest news from Devon and Cornwall Det Chief Insp Roy Linden, from the major crime investigation team, said: ""At this time there are several and significant common factors between the two addresses. ""In terms of the level of violence used we decided last night to link the investigations - originally they were treated as two separate murder investigations."" However, Supt Matt Lawler said officers were yet to establish a ""clear connection between the parties involved"". Flowers were left for the twins Dick and Roger Carter outside the property in Cowick Lane Dick and Roger Carter were born in September 1934, and were both directors of an agricultural company called Traycrop from the early 1990s until it was dissolved in 2004. ""You had a job to tell them apart they looked so similar, even at their age,"" said one neighbour who did not want to be named. Local shopkeeper Jim Wright, of Broadway Stores, said they were ""eccentric"" and ""reclusive"". ""Richard would come into the shop - I don't know the other one, he never came in."" Mr Wright's wife Kerry said: ""It's horrible to think something like that could happen outside your front door - your house is meant to be your safe place."" This video can not be played Three people who live close to the twin men in their 80s who were found dead give their reaction A police cordon was set up at the house, and a small collection of floral tributes could be seen outside. Windows of the large house were covered in what appeared to be whitewash and strips of tape. Supt Lawler said the force's local neighbourhood team would be visiting nearby residents over the next few days to provide ""advice, support, and to answer questions"". He also urged people to check on their elderly neighbours, adding it was an opportunity for the community to ""come together"". Police said both roads would be cordoned off for the rest of the day Forensic work is still being carried out at both properties Police have so far been unable to trace the family of the 80-year-old man. A neighbour said he was a ""very quiet man who kept himself to himself"". Shirley Sharpe said she did not know him personally, but he had lived in the house for ""a good few years"". The triple murder probe is being led by Devon and Cornwall Police's major crime investigation team Supt Lawler said he understood news of the deaths would ""cause significant and understandable concern and is an unprecedented event in our city which has shocked us all"". He added: ""I know that everyone's immediate thoughts will be with the family and friends of these gentlemen, and as you would expect, we are providing as much support as we can to them."" Both roads would remain cordoned off for the rest of the day, Devon and Cornwall Police said. The force has appealed for any potential witnesses from either area between 08:00 on Sunday and 13:00 on Tuesday to contact them. Police added it was ""important to avoid speculation"" during the ""complex case"".

"Serial killer Ian Brady died in 2017 The brother of Ian Brady's fourth victim has issued a plea for the contents of two briefcases left behind after the Moors Murderer's death to be revealed. Alan Bennett, whose brother Keith was never found, said Brady's solicitor has the combination-locked cases containing personal papers. Mr Bennett alleges Robin Makin has refused his ""personal plea"" and police requests to reveal the documents. Mr Makin has declined to comment. Keith Bennett was 12 when he was abducted on his way to his grandmother's house in Manchester on 16 June 1964. His brother believes the cases may reveal clues about where Brady and lover Myra Hindley buried Keith on Saddleworth Moor. Mr Bennett said he ""needed to know one way or the other"" if there was anything that could help the family's search for answers. Brady never revealed where Keith Bennett's remains were buried He said Mr Makin, the executor of Brady's will, had ""met with members of the Greater Manchester Police cold case team"" but did not let them access the cases. Mr Bennett alleged the lawyer then ""ignored pleas from the solicitor acting on my behalf and, lately, a personal plea from myself"". Moors Murderer died of natural causes Moors Murder victim's mother dies Keith Bennett - the lost victim Keith Bennett's mother Winnie Johnson died in 2012 aged 78, after a long campaign to find her son and give him a Christian burial. After Brady's death in 2017, Greater Manchester Police applied for a court order to examine the contents, which was denied on the grounds that there was no longer any prospect of an investigation leading to a prosecution. Mr Bennett's solicitor John Ainley said he had since written to Mr Makin twice to request access to the cases, but had received no reply. A Greater Manchester Police spokeswoman said: ""We do not confirm whether specific pieces of evidence or potential evidence forms part of active lines of enquiry."" Martin Bottomley, head of GMP's cold case unit, said officers would continue to ""pursue all investigative lines of enquiry"" to find Keith's body. Brady, who murdered five children between 1963 and 1965 with Hindley, died in May 2017 at the secure psychiatric unit at Ashworth Hospital in Merseyside.

"UK inflation fell to a two-year low in January, dragged lower by falling energy bills and fuel. The Office for National Statistics said the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) was 1.8% last month, from 2.1% in December. January's fall, partly offset by higher air and ferry fares, was bigger than economists' forecasts and comes as latest data shows wages rising by 3.3%. Inflation peaked at a five-year high of 3.1% in November 2017, and was last at 1.8% was in January 2017. Economists had forecast that CPI would fall in January to 2%, the Bank of England's inflation target. Mike Hardie, ONS head of inflation, said: ""The fall in inflation is due mainly to cheaper gas, electricity and petrol, partly offset by rising ferry ticket prices and air fares falling more slowly than this time last year."" Ofgem's energy price cap, which came into effect from 1 January 2019, helped drive down inflation, the ONS said. However, that cap is being raised and this is likely to feed into future CPI figures. Price of flats fell in England last year The ONS said that petrol prices were also down by 2.1% per litre between December 2018 and January 2019 due to falling crude oil prices. Hotel and restaurant prices were also lower while prices of women's and children's clothing saw larger price drops than a year earlier. As wages are rising at 3.3%, Tej Parikh, senior economist at the Institute of Directors, said the lower inflation was a ""boon"" for the economy as it attempts to weather the effects of uncertainty. ""For the past two years, households have been squeezed between high prices and weak wage growth. With inflation now at a two-year low and growing upward momentum in pay packets, consumers are likely to feel less of a pinch on their wallets. ""This easing in the cost of living should provide some uplift for the High Street just as consumer confidence appears to be waning,"" Mr Parikh said. Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, also highlighted the potential relief for retailers. He said falling inflation alongside rising earnings was ""delivering a powerful uplift to spending power"". ""Brexit dominates at the moment but were Brexit risks to ease, consumers would be well placed to hit the High Street,"" he added. Some economists think it is unlikely that inflation will fall much more. For instance, Ofgem's energy price cap may not suppress inflation for long, as the cap is due to rise in April. Andrew Wishart, UK economist at Capital Economics, said: ""The fall in CPI inflation below the Bank of England's 2% target for the first time in two years in January provides a further boost to households' real spending power, but we doubt inflation will fall any further."" Much could depend on the course of the Brexit negotiations, according to Howard Archer, chief economic advisor to the EY Item Club. ""Domestic inflationary pressures are expected to pick-up only modestly over the coming months amid likely limited UK growth,"" said Mr Archer. Assuming there is a Brexit deal, he said inflation could stay below 2% this year - and even dip to 1.6%. If there is not a deal, Mr Archer said the picture would be different and the Bank of England could cut interest rates as ""economic activity would likely take a significant hit"". We are used to hearing that our living standards have been hit by a nasty combination of above-target inflation, driven by rising energy prices, and weak pay rises. So it's refreshing to hear that has gone into reverse. The biggest driver of lower inflation, now below the Bank of England's 2% target for the first time in two years, was energy. Gas and electricity prices fell, between December 2018 and January 2019, by 8.5% and 4.9%. The price cap had an effect (although prices may soon rise as the cap rises). But there's also little inflationary pressure coming down the pipeline - for example, from higher raw material costs for producers. With pay, at the last count, rising by 3.3% living standards are now rising faster than they have since November 2016. Just because, collectively, we are now in an economic slowdown, doesn't mean we each, individually, are getting worse off. Economists would usually expect higher wages and a lower unemployment rate -data last month showed job vacancies are at a record high of 853,000- to push up the rate of price increases. Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the data showed the ""continued breakdown of the relationship between the labour market and inflation"". ""Theory dictates that a tight labour market, low unemployment and higher wage growth, should lead to higher inflation. This means policymakers face a straight trade-off between inflation and unemployment. ""But at present the inflation genie is still firmly in the bottle, despite unemployment at multi-decade lows. This has made the Bank of England's job much easier over the past few years,"" Mr Brettell said.

"Andrew Hill has started to give evidence at the Old Bailey A pilot accused of killing 11 men when his Hawker Hunter jet crashed at the Shoreham Airshow has denied claims he was cavalier or thrill-seeking. Giving evidence at the Old Bailey, Andrew Hill said ""it was the primary aim of the display to avoid risk"". It is the first time the ex-military pilot has spoken in public since he was pulled from the wreckage of his plane. Mr Hill, 54, from Sandon in Hertfordshire, denies 11 counts of manslaughter by gross negligence. His vintage jet crashed on to the A27 on 22 August 2015 after failing to complete an aerobatic manoeuvre. Asked by his defence barrister Karim Khalil if he had ever ""any mind to cause risk to anybody"" at an air show, Mr Hill said: ""Absolutely not. It was the primary aim of the display to avoid risk."" Questioned about what he got out of displays, he said it was ""probably the highest level of discipline in what you could do with flying an aircraft, particularly in this environment now I'm in the civilian world"". Mr Hill went on to reject the prosecution's description of him as a ""cavalier pilot"", saying he ""took a structured, disciplined approach"" to flying. ""I held back from areas I was uncomfortable doing... we have our strengths and weaknesses and experience,"" he told the court. Andrew Hill's Hawker Hunter jet was too low when he performed a loop, the court was told Taking the court through his thoughts and processes when preparing for display flights, Mr Hill said he was known for his ""detail and preparation and planning"". Before he took off at North Weald airfield on the day of the crash, he was seen walking around in his flying suit. He told the court he had been carrying out a practice by walking through the display, which is something he does with all his displays, after making diagrams of his routines on paper. Jurors were shown more footage of Mr Hill flying at different air shows, including him carrying out the same ""bent loop"" stunt in the same aircraft at an air show at Shannon Airport just over a month before the crash. Errors made during Shoreham re-enactment Shoreham pilot 'fundamentally negligent' 'No sign' Shoreham crash pilot blacked out The court heard about a flight at Duxford where Mr Hill received a ""display line"" call, alerting him to the possibility he might breach the ""display line"". Mr Hill said: ""I disregarded it because I was concentrating on flying."" He said later the flight information controller apologised to him for making the call and told him he had not realised what he was doing. Asked if he had any concerns on whether he could control the manoeuvres he had in mind, Mr Hill replied: ""No."" Andrew Hill was thrown from the cockpit of the Hawker Hunter after it crashed Jurors earlier heard Mr Hill was educated in Kent, and was recruited into the RAF as a frontline pilot straight from university. During his career, he was on active service for a month in northern Iraq, and also received an award for writing a computer programme that contributed to aircraft safety. Mr Hill left the RAF in 1995 and went into civil aviation, becoming a commercial pilot starting with Virgin Atlantic before moving to British Airways and progressing ""relatively quickly"" to the most senior position of captain. He suffered burns, fractures and a collapsed lung after the vintage jet he was flying crashed. Mr Hill had passed medical checks before the crash, while tests and scans carried out afterwards did not show any sign of a medical condition - including cognitive impairment - which may have affected his health leading up to the crash, the court heard. The trial continues.

"The app makes it easier for men to prevent women from travelling, human rights group claim A Saudi Arabian app that can be used to track women and prevent them from travelling will be investigated by Apple, its chief executive has said. In an interview with NPR,,externalTim Cook said he wasn't aware of the Absher app but would look into it. The app, which offers access to government services, has been criticised by human rights groups. Democratic senator Ron Wyden has called for Apple and Google to remove it from their stores. Women in Saudi Arabia need to get permission to leave the country from a male guardian, usually a father or husband. The Absher app, which is designed for a range of government services, such as renewing driving licences, makes the process of allowing or prohibiting travel a lot easier, and it can be done via a smartphone. Originally designed for the Ministry of Interior, the app has been in use for several years and downloaded more than a million times. An investigation from website Insider,externalexposed how it was being used by male guardians to register wives, sisters and daughters to either restrict or permit international travel. The man receives a notification if a dependent woman attempts to leave the country. Human Rights Watch told the publication: ""Apps like this one can facilitate human rights abuses, including discrimination against women."" In an open letter to both companies, in response to the report, Mr Wyden wrote: ""It is hardly news that the Saudi monarchy seeks to restrict and repress Saudi women but American companies should not enable or facilitate the Saudi government's patriarchy."" The app has also been used by some women to secretly change the settings on their male guardian's phone so that it allows them to travel, the Insider reports. Google has not responded to requests from the BBC for comment.

"Dettinger, here portrayed in a mural alongside the word ""freedom"", has become known throughout France A former French boxing champion has been convicted for assaulting two police officers at an anti-government ""yellow vest"" protest in Paris. Christophe Dettinger, 37,  was filmed on 5 January throwing punches in footage that was widely shared on social media. He was sentenced to 30 months in jail. Eighteen months of the sentence are suspended, and he will be able to serve the 12 months in what is termed ""semi-liberty"". The protests began in mid-November over fuel taxes but broadened into a revolt against President Emmanuel Macron. Who are the 'gilets jaunes'? Dettinger's case, and the yellow vest movement, have divided France. In a separate development on Wednesday, the restaurant of a Michelin-starred French chef was targeted in a suspected arson attack - the second time in two weeks. Prosecutors are now investigating whether Yannick Delpech's restaurant L'Amphitryon was set ablaze in retaliation for his criticism of the ""yellow vest"" movement. The verdict was announced by the Paris Criminal Court on Wednesday. It said that Dettinger would spend one year in prison in the ""semi-liberty"" regime. That means he will serve night times in jail, but will be at liberty during the day. He is also banned from staying in Paris for six months. The former champion handed himself into police last month Reports from the courtroom suggested Dettinger's supporters were happy with the sentence. He could have been jailed for seven years. During the trial, he said he had made a ""mistake"" after seeing police clashing with protesters. Dettinger, who was France's cruiserweight champion in 2007-08, handed himself into police custody two days after the 5 January protest. Following his arrest,more than â¬114,000 (Â£102,000) was raised in a fundraiser for the former boxer. Thousands left comments in support, including some opposition politicians. The page was then removed after sharp criticism that it condoned violence against the police. Dettinger, a father of three, had been working as a public servant in the south of the city before the incident. Before handing himself in to police, Dettinger posted a video of himself on YouTube explaining his actions. Les gilets jaunes: The full story In it, he described himself as an ""ordinary citizen"" who had ""reacted wrongly"" in anger after witnessing police using tear-gas and flash-ball (rubber bullet) rounds against protesters. Another protester, Gwenaelle Antinori Le Joncour, spoke as a witness in Dettinger's defence in the one-day trial on Wednesday. ""He was seeing a woman of 47 kilos being hit and seeing my oldest son being hit that he couldn't stand, because there was too much violence,"" she said in court. During the trial, Dettinger's lawyer argued he was responding to Ms Le Joncour (pictured) being assaulted by police The number of gilets jaunes (yellow vest) protesters taking to French streets has been gradually falling - but tens of thousands are still turning out weekly to demonstrate across France. Their protests have often turned violent, causing damage - including to some of Paris' most famous monuments. Hundreds of injuries and a number of deaths have also been linked to the demonstrations. Almost 1,800 people have been sentenced in court so far, mostly with destruction of public property and attacks on the police, AFP reports. Another 1,400 more protesters are still awaiting trial, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said on Tuesday. Eric Drouet, one of the group's leading figures, is due to appear in court in Paris on Friday on charges of illegally organising a demonstration.

"Female tiger Melati was killed last week by potential mate, Asim, during their first introduction Zoos in Britain should be brought under a ""centralised licensing"" system, an animal charity has said following the deaths of two tigers in the last week. A female tiger at London Zoo was killed by a potential mate and another died after tigers fought at a safari park. The Born Free Foundation says the zoo licensing rules currently overseen by local authorities have ""differences in understanding and application"". The zoo trade body says the tiger deaths were unrelated to licensing. The Born Free Foundation, which campaigns to keep wildlife in the wild, says that ""significant incidents occur with disturbing frequency"" at zoos. It says it has logged 33 incidents since 2016, including thedeath of eight Humboldt penguinsfollowing a ""urban fox"" attack and anescaped snow leopard which was shotafter a zookeeper left an enclosure door open. The charity's head of animal welfare and captivity, Chris Draper, says ""licensing and inspection of zoos in Britain is currently the responsibility of the large number of local authorities"". This leaves thelaw,external""open to interpretation"", he said. The professional body which represents more than 100 zoos and aquariums says it was ""saddened to hear of the deaths of two female tigers at two of its member collections in recent days"". But the British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquariums (BIAZA) rejects Born Free's call for changes to licensing, saying the events must not overshadow the important conservation work undertaken by its members. ""BIAZA welcomes robust zoo licensing and endorses recent steps taken by Defra [Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs] to strengthen the zoo licensing process in the UK,"" a spokeswoman added. Anendangered female Sumatran tiger was killedby a potential mate during their first introduction at London Zoo on 8 February. The zoo saidstaff used air horns and fire extinguishersto stop the male tiger, Asim, from killing Melati. However, despite the best efforts of the vets, 10-year-old Melati died. Thirteen-year-old female tiger Shouri had lived at the park since 2006 On Monday, arare Amur tiger died in a fightwith two other tigers at Longleat Safari and Adventure Park in Wiltshire. The park said 13-year-old female Shouri was killed after gaining access to a paddock where two other tigers, Red and Yana, were being held. A fight took place between the three animals. The park said a full investigation was ongoing to determine the exact circumstances surrounding the ""terribly sad event"". There are thought to be only 300 Sumatran tigers and 540 Amur tigers left in the wild. A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, said: ""The UK has some of the highest animal welfare standards in the world. ""The current licensing regime for zoos is enforced by local authorities, but they are regularly inspected by trained professionals against our high standards. ""These standards are developed together with leading animal welfare experts on our Zoos Expert Committee.""

"Parents should not be complacent about the risks of teenagers using cannabis, experts are warning. UK and Canada researchers said they had found ""robust"" evidence showing using the drug in adolescence increased the risk of developing depression in adulthood by 37%. They said the findings should act as a warning to families who saw cannabis use as part of the growing-up process. The team added that the developing brain was particularly susceptible. The researchers - from University of Oxford and Montreal's McGill University - said cannabis use in the young was an ""important public health issue"", particularly given that cannabis available today tends to be much stronger than it was previously. Around one in nine young adults and teenagers use the drug each year in England and Wales. Report author Prof Andrea Cipriani conceded some parents had a relaxed attitude to the drug, but added the evidence was clear. ""This is important information for parents and teenagers. The risk is modest, but it can have a devastating impact."" Cannabis 'worse than alcohol' for teens Young 'think cannabis safer than alcohol' This is the first time the actual risk has been quantified in this way. The team looked at 11 previous studies, covering more than 23,000 young people, the journal JAMA Psychiatry reported. Young people who had already shown signs of depression or had a family history of the condition were excluded. It found cannabis use before 18 increased the chance of an individual developing depression in young adulthood - defined as before the age of 35 - by 37%. In terms of numbers that means around one in 14 cases of depression in that age group - around 60,000 in the UK - could be attributed to drug use in the teenage years. The study also looked at whether there was an association with anxiety and suicide attempts. There was an increased risk of anxiety developing in young adulthood, but it was not considered statistically significant. Meanwhile, those who used cannabis in their teenage years were three times more likely to try to kill themselves - although the data on that trend was not considered robust enough to draw a firm conclusion. No. The researchers were unable to prove cannabis use was definitively causing depression. Instead, they could only say it looked to be a strong link. This is because of the figures they found, but also what is known about the impact cannabis has on the developing brain. Evidence has suggested that the drug affects the parts of brain that govern rational and emotional thinking as well as serotonin levels that influence mood. To prove the link, trials would have to be conducted on young people - something that will never be done because it is unethical. King's College London psychiatrist Prof Sir Robin Murray said the research could not be considered conclusive, but acknowledged the findings were ""probably correct"". He said the risk of developing depression was smaller than what has already been established for schizophrenia-like psychosis. He also said it was likely that any risk would be also down to the amounts of cannabis consumed and the strength - something this study was unable to unpick.

"Toni McLachlan is the girlfriend of Alesha's father A woman named by a murder accused as the person who killed six-year-old Alesha MacPhail has denied being involved in her death. Toni McLachlan was giving evidence during the trial of a 16-year-old boy, who denies abducting, raping and murdering Alesha last July. The teenager, who cannot be named because of his age, has claimed it was Ms McLachlan who killed Alesha. Ms McLachlan told the court that she had loved the little girl ""to pieces"". And when asked by prosecutor Iain McSporran QC whether she had anything to do with Alesha's murder, she replied: ""No"". Alesha's father 'sold cannabis to accused' Boy accused of Alesha murder blames woman Alesha's naked body was found in the grounds of a former hotel in Rothesay on the Isle of Bute on the morning of 2 July last year. Giving evidence from behind a screen at the High Court in Glasgow, 18-year-old Ms McLachlan said she had been dating Alesha's father Robert MacPhail, 26, for about two years. At the time of the murder she was living with Mr MacPhail's parents in a three-bedroom flat on Ardbeg Road, Rothesay. Alesha's body was found in the grounds of a former hotel on 2 July last year She told the court she had dealt cannabis with Mr MacPhail, and had supplied the drug to the accused and his sister. Alesha was spending the start of her summer break with her father and grandparents at the house when she was killed. The relationship between Mr MacPhail and Alesha's mother Georgina Lochrane from Coatbridge, North Lanarkshire, had broken down months after she was born. Ms McLachlan said she only learned on Monday, on the opening day of the trial, that she had been implicated by the accused. Alesha's father, Robert MacPhail, told the court on Tuesday that he had sold cannabis to the accused She said she had gone into Alesha's bedroom the night before the killing to turn off the child's TV, which was stuck on the menu page of a Peppa Pig DVD with the theme tune playing. Fighting back tears, Ms McLachlan said: ""She was sleeping and her face was facing the wall and her hair was behind her on the pillow."" She could not recall the time, but said she did not see Alesha again. The court was told the accused tried to contact Ms McLachlan via Facebook Messenger at 01:47 and 01:48 on 2 July, hours before Alesha was reported missing. Alesha was tucked up in bed by her father the night before she died The witness called the accused back at 06:29 as the search for the missing girl got under way. There was no answer, but he messaged her at 09:01 to apologise for contacting her. Ms McLachlan replied: ""Want to keep an eye out for Rabs wee girl please x"", with the accused messaging back: ""Yh (Yeah) whats happened?"" Ms McLachlan responded: ""Shes went missing from house police are looking for her and helicopter is out."" The accused replied: ""Oh damn. Am sure she's not went too far x"", with Ms McLachlan responding: ""Hopefully x"". During cross examination by defence lawyer Brian McConnachie QC, who is representing the accused, the court was told Alesha's father, Robert MacPhail, is currently on bail for alleged domestic abuse. Ms McLachlan confirmed the charge involved her but denied her boyfriend had physically assaulted her - saying the charge followed a heated row after a drinking session following a friend's funeral. She said she called the police over the incident but confirmed they were still a couple. The court heard that Mr MacPhail and Ms McLachlan are still a couple Ms McLachlan also denied being jealous of Alesha and telling a friend that the child's death would be ""for the best"". And she denied leaving the flat after the accused contacted her at around 01:50 on 2 July, and then having sex with him. The QC then accused her of returning to the property on Ardbeg Road, abducting Alesha and then murdering her, before planting the accused's DNA, from a used condom, on the child's body. Ms McLachlan again denied she had anything to do with the murder, before adding that it felt ""horrible"" to be blamed for the crime ""especially when it is somebody you do love so much."" She added: ""She knew I loved her and that is what I am trying to keep in my head."" The court later heard from Jorge Williams, a member of the public who discovered Alesha's body after joining the search for her when his partner spotted an appeal on Facebook. Speaking of his shock at finding the lifeless child in a wooded area, he said: ""I crouched down and leaned over her and tried to find a pulse."" When he failed to do so, he walked down a path leading to the main road and dialled 999, when he told the operator: ""I've found the wee girl. She's dead"". After Mr Williams completed his evidence, judge Lord Matthews told him: ""People like you are the salt of the earth and I am very grateful to you for what you tried to do."" Sgt Martin Wilson then described how he was the first police officer on the scene, and was led to the area where the body was found by Mr Williams. He checked for a pulse on the child's left arm and on her neck, but found no signs of life and said her arm had been ""a bit rigid"". The officer was visibly moved during his evidence, and informed the court he had a seven-year-old daughter of his own. Giving evidence on Tuesday, Alesha's father said he had put his daughter to bed at about 22:30 or 23:00 on the night before she was allegedly taken, before going to the bedroom he shared with Ms McLachlan, where they ""watched some porn"" before going to sleep. They were woken the next morning by his parents, who told him Alesha was not in her bed. They searched the house before taking the hunt outside to her favourite places, including the local park. Also on Tuesday, Alesha's grandmother Angela King, 47, told the court Alesha and Ms McLachlan got on ""great"" and that the youngster called her ""Toto"". It is illegal in Scotland to publish the name, address, school or any other information which could identify anyone under the age of 18 who is the accused, victim or witness in a criminal case This law applies to social media as well as to websites, newspapers and TV and radio programmes. However, the name of victims who have died can be published - so the BBC and other outlets are able to identify Alesha MacPhail. Ahead of their trial, the accused can lodge a special defence such as self-defence (they were defending themselves from attack), alibi (they were somewhere else when the crime was committed) and mental disorder (the accused is not responsible for their actions because they were suffering from a psychiatric condition). In this case, the accused has lodged a special defence of incrimination, which means he has claimed that someone else (Toni McLachlan) was responsible. However, the Crown must still prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt. There is no onus on the accused to prove their special defence is true, and he or she can still be acquitted even if the jury does not believe their special defence.

"Toni McLachlan is the girlfriend of Alesha's father A woman named by a murder accused as the person who killed six-year-old Alesha MacPhail has denied being involved in her death. Toni McLachlan was giving evidence during the trial of a 16-year-old boy, who denies abducting, raping and murdering Alesha last July. The teenager, who cannot be named because of his age, has claimed it was Ms McLachlan who killed Alesha. Ms McLachlan told the court that she had loved the little girl ""to pieces"". And when asked by prosecutor Iain McSporran QC whether she had anything to do with Alesha's murder, she replied: ""No"". Alesha's father 'sold cannabis to accused' Boy accused of Alesha murder blames woman Alesha's naked body was found in the grounds of a former hotel in Rothesay on the Isle of Bute on the morning of 2 July last year. Giving evidence from behind a screen at the High Court in Glasgow, 18-year-old Ms McLachlan said she had been dating Alesha's father Robert MacPhail, 26, for about two years. At the time of the murder she was living with Mr MacPhail's parents in a three-bedroom flat on Ardbeg Road, Rothesay. Alesha's body was found in the grounds of a former hotel on 2 July last year She told the court she had dealt cannabis with Mr MacPhail, and had supplied the drug to the accused and his sister. Alesha was spending the start of her summer break with her father and grandparents at the house when she was killed. The relationship between Mr MacPhail and Alesha's mother Georgina Lochrane from Coatbridge, North Lanarkshire, had broken down months after she was born. Ms McLachlan said she only learned on Monday, on the opening day of the trial, that she had been implicated by the accused. Alesha's father, Robert MacPhail, told the court on Tuesday that he had sold cannabis to the accused She said she had gone into Alesha's bedroom the night before the killing to turn off the child's TV, which was stuck on the menu page of a Peppa Pig DVD with the theme tune playing. Fighting back tears, Ms McLachlan said: ""She was sleeping and her face was facing the wall and her hair was behind her on the pillow."" She could not recall the time, but said she did not see Alesha again. The court was told the accused tried to contact Ms McLachlan via Facebook Messenger at 01:47 and 01:48 on 2 July, hours before Alesha was reported missing. Alesha was tucked up in bed by her father the night before she died The witness called the accused back at 06:29 as the search for the missing girl got under way. There was no answer, but he messaged her at 09:01 to apologise for contacting her. Ms McLachlan replied: ""Want to keep an eye out for Rabs wee girl please x"", with the accused messaging back: ""Yh (Yeah) whats happened?"" Ms McLachlan responded: ""Shes went missing from house police are looking for her and helicopter is out."" The accused replied: ""Oh damn. Am sure she's not went too far x"", with Ms McLachlan responding: ""Hopefully x"". During cross examination by defence lawyer Brian McConnachie QC, who is representing the accused, the court was told Alesha's father, Robert MacPhail, is currently on bail for alleged domestic abuse. Ms McLachlan confirmed the charge involved her but denied her boyfriend had physically assaulted her - saying the charge followed a heated row after a drinking session following a friend's funeral. She said she called the police over the incident but confirmed they were still a couple. The court heard that Mr MacPhail and Ms McLachlan are still a couple Ms McLachlan also denied being jealous of Alesha and telling a friend that the child's death would be ""for the best"". And she denied leaving the flat after the accused contacted her at around 01:50 on 2 July, and then having sex with him. The QC then accused her of returning to the property on Ardbeg Road, abducting Alesha and then murdering her, before planting the accused's DNA, from a used condom, on the child's body. Ms McLachlan again denied she had anything to do with the murder, before adding that it felt ""horrible"" to be blamed for the crime ""especially when it is somebody you do love so much."" She added: ""She knew I loved her and that is what I am trying to keep in my head."" The court later heard from Jorge Williams, a member of the public who discovered Alesha's body after joining the search for her when his partner spotted an appeal on Facebook. Speaking of his shock at finding the lifeless child in a wooded area, he said: ""I crouched down and leaned over her and tried to find a pulse."" When he failed to do so, he walked down a path leading to the main road and dialled 999, when he told the operator: ""I've found the wee girl. She's dead"". After Mr Williams completed his evidence, judge Lord Matthews told him: ""People like you are the salt of the earth and I am very grateful to you for what you tried to do."" Sgt Martin Wilson then described how he was the first police officer on the scene, and was led to the area where the body was found by Mr Williams. He checked for a pulse on the child's left arm and on her neck, but found no signs of life and said her arm had been ""a bit rigid"". The officer was visibly moved during his evidence, and informed the court he had a seven-year-old daughter of his own. Giving evidence on Tuesday, Alesha's father said he had put his daughter to bed at about 22:30 or 23:00 on the night before she was allegedly taken, before going to the bedroom he shared with Ms McLachlan, where they ""watched some porn"" before going to sleep. They were woken the next morning by his parents, who told him Alesha was not in her bed. They searched the house before taking the hunt outside to her favourite places, including the local park. Also on Tuesday, Alesha's grandmother Angela King, 47, told the court Alesha and Ms McLachlan got on ""great"" and that the youngster called her ""Toto"".

"On the surface: HP3 is on the left; the domed SEIS is on the right The US space agency's (Nasa) InSight mission has positioned the second of its surface instruments on Mars.

"This video can not be played A BBC undercover investigation revealed an international dogfighting network. Warning: Contains distressing scenes of animal cruelty A BBC investigation into the dark world of organised dogfighting discovered an illegal trade of fighting dogs stretching from Eastern Europe to Wales. The fighters face each other, ready. One rushes forward into a clash of jaws. The ground is already flecked with blood. The lighter one is winning, locked onto its opponent. The black one has lost the ability to fight back.  Now, it simply fights for survival. Eventually it attempts to walk, but collapses, legs giving way, head hitting the ground. The fight is over. It dies the next day. Dogs don't do this naturally, experts say. They are trained, by men who smile, encourage and place bets, as their animals tear themselves apart. This is the disturbing world of organised dogfighting. In 2016 the BBC was briefed exclusively on dogfighting by the British charity, the League Against Cruel Sports (LACS.) Former police officers had identified key players in an international scene. ""There is still a significant amount going on,"" says the League's head of investigations Martin Simms. In the last year the organisation has received nearly 100 calls about dogfighting to a confidential hotline it runs. The charity had evidence that men were breeding, training, buying, selling and betting on fighting dogs - or as they are known in the business, ""game dogs"". The LACS investigation, codenamed Operation Bloodline, was aided by the internet. Animal fighting is an ancient pastime, which, like most subcultures, has now found its place online. For ""dog men"" - and it is almost always men - reputation is the currency that matters. So the merits of particular dogs and breeders are now discussed on Facebook, on specialist closed forums, and - between those involved - on messaging apps. Sometimes they operate in plain sight, using terminology the average reader might not understand. A dog could be described as a Grand Champion (Gr Ch), a five-times winner or a champion (Ch) with three wins. They are not talking about Crufts. Former police detective, Mark Randell, runs Hidden-In-Sight, a private investigations agency specialising in wildlife crime. He led the LACS investigation until 2017. ""'Ch' is used in kennel club circles but in a different context,"" he said. ""'Ch' next to a large muscled dog with a chain and facial injuries will always be dogfighting."" Randell has identified around 70 British people linked with dogfighting. But the LACS investigators had worked covertly to gather the evidence. Publishing it would blow their covers. So in 2017 we began our own investigation into the international dogfighting scene, and we picked a promising target. Investigators say there is ""still a significant amount"" of dogfighting going on Ivaylo Nikolov is 37, an intelligent, friendly, English-speaking Bulgarian from the Danube city of Ruse in the north of the country. Ivo, as we came to know him, is associated with a company that buys, sells and transports dogs around the world. The Balkans has become the centre of Europe's dogfighting business. Ivo liked to document his work on Facebook. The League Against Cruel Sports gathered posts suggesting he has travelled to around 29 countries, including the UK, with his dogs. But among the messages, status posts and check-ins were interesting clues. One picture suggested the animals he transports are not just family pets A dog had ripped apart the bars of its travel cage, causing bloody damage in the process. In other places he occasionally slipped up and used dogfighting terminology. It was time to find out more about him. One photograph appeared to show a dog had ripped apart the bars of its travel cage We asked an Italian animal welfare investigator Sylvia (not her real name) to start sending Ivo WhatsApp messages. She told him she had relatives in a hunting lodge interested in buying a certain type of dog. One of them was Nik. Older, with an impressive beard, he looked the part. Nik was from the countryside of Northern Italy, and spoke no English. Sylvia would translate for him in English. Neither Sylvia nor Nik were experts in match dogs, but behind the scenes a former police officer with decades of experience investigating dogfighting, was also working for the BBC, advising them about the right language to use. Sylvia sent Ivo a picture of a fake handwritten note from the hunters, a shopping list of dogs they were interested in (with an actual shopping list for food added at the bottom as if she had been short of paper.) The dogs specified included some for hunting, but also pitbulls, the breed of choice for dog fighting. The American Pitbull Terrier is almost the only type prepared to fight for long periods. It is banned under Britain's controversial Dangerous Dogs Act. Silvia sent Ivo a list of the dogs she wanted Ivo took the bait. The deal started to develop. The hunting dogs were forgotten as the weeks went on. Eventually Ivo offered Sylvia and Nik a ""very good dog"". ""Reliable and ready for match,"" he wrote in one message. Nik, he said, could ""bet good money on him"". The price would be 3,000 euros (approximately Â£2,698) plus costs. The dog would be supplied by Ivo's contact, a kennel in Moldova, a day's drive from Bulgaria. By this point we'd learnt a lot about Ivo and his dogs. The international salesman had been keen to demonstrate his credentials. His WhatsApp messages kept Sylvia and Nik up-to-date on the dogfighting scene. He sent a video of a match - apparently showing the dogs mentioned in his messages fighting in an undisclosed Eastern European location. Sylvia received a match report. ""One win, in one hour and 17 minutes"", read a message. Fights sometimes stretch to two hours. ""Please keep the video very private,"" he added. Ivo began sending our investigators footage of dogfights Two weeks later he was planning a trip to the Caribbean where he was expecting to see seven dogfights. But eventually he sent a fight video including a dog he was offering for sale. The video is difficult to watch. By the end the dogs are covered with blood.  The watching men hold ""break sticks""- used to pull apart the animals - in hands which are also red with blood. The confrontation is what is known as a ""roll"" - an informal match sometimes used to prove a dog's willingness to fight. Ivo offered to take our undercover investigators to rolls. ""We will have fun in our field,"" he said. He appeared to have a genuine love for dogs but also for dogfighting. By now, he believed our investigators shared his feelings. He said: ""It's always very great joy for me when I meet people with such a great desire, and I'm not talking about sales, money or anything else. I'm only talking about the true pure love for the game."" Yet it was partly about money. Ivo was so impressed with the dog he was selling, he wanted to bet on it ""when he's ready to match"". What we didn't have was his home address or that of the kennels to which he was connected. He had been careful not to give away this vital information. So we began planning to lure him to a meeting. Everything he had suggested was illegal in Bulgaria. Meanwhile, information from the League Against Cruel Sports led us to valuable sources of intelligence about dogfighting online. They included specialist websites where owners record the pedigrees of their dogs and sometimes the results of their matches. They do not use their real identities, instead hiding behind nicknames or the names of their kennels. Who was Iceboy? In 2014 someone using the name The Gameyard posted a picture of a pitbull named Iceboy. So who was Iceboy, and most importantly, who was The Gameyard? The clue was in the background of the picture, which we identified from the shapes of distant hills and nearby buildings, as Merthyr Tydfil in South Wales, near the Brecon Beacons. In fact it was possible to pinpoint the exact location at which the picture was taken - a patch of grass within walking distance of the home of dogfighter Kerry Evans. He was convicted in 2014 of keeping or training Pit Bull Terriersbut not, at that point, sent to prison. Dogfighting in the UK is a crime which attracts maximum sentences of just six months, handed down by a magistrate rather than being heard in a crown court. Campaigners say that must change. We decided to take a closer look at Evans - or rather his dogs - so we started to examine the animal's ""bloodline"". The bloodline is a crucial concept in dogfighting. Dogs which perform well in fights are highly valued. Those with tenacity are described as displaying ""gameness"". Those who shy away are dismissed as ""curs"". Kerry Evans was found guilty of keeping or training Pit Bull Terriers A game dog will pass its abilities to its offspring through breeding. And the bloodlines of top dogs are highly valued. Some become legendary. One, called Chinaman, was notorious for continuing a fight despite critical injuries. Its bloodline and its name have been passed to countless animals around the world. On the pedigree websites Iceboy's father, or sire, was listed as ""Aspen"", a dog bred by ""Tomy Kennels"". And who is Tomy Kennels? Back to our Bulgarian dealer, Ivaylo Nikolov, or as his Facebook profile describes him, Ivaylo Tomy Flyman Nikolov. Tomy Kennels is directly linked to Ivo. We have evidence that he provided dogs to Kerry Evans in the UK, possibly to breed from. A Facebook post showed one of his dogs, named Aspen and listed as a champion, was brought to the UK in 2016.  It may have been used to breed a number of British fighting dogs. This video can not be played Dogfighting trader secretly filmed arranging sale By now, our undercover investigators, Sylvia and Nik, were making good progress. They had arranged to meet Ivo in Bucharest, en route from his home across the Danube in Bulgaria to the kennels in Moldova where the fighting dog we had ordered would be picked up. The BBC was not about to put 3,000 euros into the pocket of a dogfighter, so the meeting, in a burger restaurant, had to be handled carefully. Captured by our hidden cameras, Ivo arrived, having battled through rush-hour traffic.  The final details of the deal, thrashed out on WhatsApp, were agreed face-to-face. Ivo's Moldovan dog breeder contact was giving them the pick of the litter, he said. ""He gets the best ones and he either goes to match or he calls me and he says 'these are the two or three ones which are the best ones.  If you have a good client I may sell, nothing else.'"" Sylvia asked how we would get the dog through customs checks. Transporting a dog for use in fighting is illegal. Ivo said his contact in Moldova ""is actually a state vet in his region"" and can issue ""any document we want"". But he said, ""when you travel with Moldovan papers you have too much checks so I have made Bulgarian documents, also blood tests and export certificates."" Often the exact breed of the dogs are 'fudged' to make it harder for customs officials to detect whether they fall foul of laws such as Britain's Dangerous Dogs Act. Dog microchips can also be inserted by anyone with the right device. It was time to confront Ivaylo Nikolov as he left the restaurant. This video can not be played The BBC confronted Ivaylo Nikolov about dogfighting Apparently stunned at being exposed, he refused to make any comment. ""I don't know you, I don't want to talk to you,"" he said. Pursued by a BBC camera crew he attempted to get away.  He walked straight past his car parked nearby, perhaps concerned its licence plate might be captured on camera. In fact we had already identified the plate, which briefly appeared in a video he had previously sent to our undercover investigators. Nikolov refused to answer any of our questions. But a couple of days later, the Facebook account which he had told our investigators was crucial to what he did, was taken down.  YouTube links he had sent, also disappeared. He hasn't responded to our further attempts to contact him. Dogfighting is illegal in most of the world's developed countries. UK law bans not only fighting, but also owning fighting dogs, training them to fight, trading animals and even filming fights without good reason. The RSPCA's head of investigations, Mike Butcher, is the country's only expert witness in dogfighting able to give evidence in court. He is fascinated by the dogfighting criminals he has encountered on raids with the police. They have ""an obsessive love"" for dogs, he says. ""We've been to houses before where we've said we're taking your money, your drugs, your gun. They say 'yeah right but you're not having my dog though'. I've seen them attack four or five coppers, or burst into tears."" Yet organised dogfights inevitably result in animal deaths and serious injuries. The referee usually has no power to stop the fight.  Only a fatality or an owner withdrawing their dog brings the cruelty to an end. The League Against Cruel Sports believes dogfighting is not being properly tackled. It wants a national register of owners who are banned from owning dogs, a review of the Dangerous Dogs Act and tougher sentences. Its research raises concerns not just about high-level organised fights, but also the use of dogs by street gangs, either to settle scores through ad-hoc matches or for protection. Last month three dogs were seized at a property in Dumfries Dogfighters are also more likely to be involved in other types of serious crime. And there is evidence of a low-level group of ""wannabe"" dogfighters obsessed with the culture of ""strong"" dogs. These are dogs who may not take part in matches, but are trained to be aggressive, risking injury to other animals and people. During our investigation we obtained footage of dogs being kicked or lifted into the air by their jaws, to improve the strength of their bite. One chilling video from a Northern Ireland dogfighting case showed men shaking a cat out of a tree, so that it could be ripped apart by a dog on the ground. The charity's further investigations have produced a wider list of possible suspects. As a result, recently the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals raided a house in Dumfries, seizing three dogs. An animal cruelty investigation has been launched. As for Ivo, after we confronted him, his social media profiles were taken offline and, sadly, the dog he offered us remains in the world of dogfighting.

"The body of an 80-year-old man was found in a house in Bonhay Road A man has been arrested on suspicion of murder after three men in their 80s - two of whom were believed to have been twins - were found dead. The bodies of two 84-year-olds, named locally as Dick and Roger Carter, were found in Exeter on Tuesday, a day after the body of an 80-year-old man was discovered. Police said the level of violence used against all three had led them to link the deaths. A 27-year-old man is in police custody. Officers were first called to Bonhay Road at 15:00 GMT on Monday, where they found the body of the 80-year-old. At 13:00 on Tuesday, police attended a property in Cowick Lane, about 1.5 miles (2.4km) away, and discovered the bodies of the two other men. Latest news from Devon and Cornwall Det Chief Insp Roy Linden, from the major crime investigation team, said: ""At this time there are several and significant common factors between the two addresses. ""In terms of the level of violence used we decided last night to link the investigations - originally they were treated as two separate murder investigations."" However, Supt Matt Lawler said officers were yet to establish a ""clear connection between the parties involved"". Flowers were left for the twins Dick and Roger Carter outside the property in Cowick Lane Dick and Roger Carter were born in September 1934, and were both directors of an agricultural company called Traycrop from the early 1990s until it was dissolved in 2004. ""You had a job to tell them apart they looked so similar, even at their age,"" said one neighbour who did not want to be named. Local shopkeeper Jim Wright, of Broadway Stores, said they were ""eccentric"" and ""reclusive"". ""Richard would come into the shop - I don't know the other one, he never came in."" Mr Wright's wife Kerry said: ""It's horrible to think something like that could happen outside your front door - your house is meant to be your safe place."" This video can not be played Three people who live close to the twin men in their 80s who were found dead give their reaction A police cordon was set up at the house, and a small collection of floral tributes could be seen outside. Windows of the large house were covered in what appeared to be whitewash and strips of tape. Supt Lawler said the force's local neighbourhood team would be visiting nearby residents over the next few days to provide ""advice, support, and to answer questions"". He also urged people to check on their elderly neighbours, adding it was an opportunity for the community to ""come together"". Police said both roads would be cordoned off for the rest of the day Forensic work is still being carried out at both properties Police have so far been unable to trace the family of the 80-year-old man. A neighbour said he was a ""very quiet man who kept himself to himself"". Shirley Sharpe said she did not know him personally, but he had lived in the house for ""a good few years"". The triple murder probe is being led by Devon and Cornwall Police's major crime investigation team Supt Lawler said he understood news of the deaths would ""cause significant and understandable concern and is an unprecedented event in our city which has shocked us all"". He added: ""I know that everyone's immediate thoughts will be with the family and friends of these gentlemen, and as you would expect, we are providing as much support as we can to them."" Both roads would remain cordoned off for the rest of the day, Devon and Cornwall Police said. The force has appealed for any potential witnesses from either area between 08:00 on Sunday and 13:00 on Tuesday to contact them.

"On the surface: HP3 is on the left; the domed SEIS is on the right The US space agency's (Nasa) InSight mission has positioned the second of its surface instruments on Mars. Known as HP3, the heat-flow probe was picked up off the deck of the lander with a robot arm and placed next to the SEIS seismometer package, which was deployed in December. Together with an onboard radio experiment, these sensor systems will be used to investigate the interior of the planet, to understand its present-day activity and how the sub-surface rocks are layered.

"Miller (right) will almost certainly be the heaviest opponent Joshua has faced Anthony Joshua will fight in the US for the first time when he defends his IBF, WBA and WBO world heavyweight titles against Jarrell Miller on 1 June. Joshua, 29, will take on Miller at Madison Square Garden in the undefeated American's home city of New York. Miller, with 23 wins and a draw, has never fought for a world title. The 30-year-old will almost certainly be the heaviest opponent Joshua has faced as a professional having weighed 22st 7lbs in his last contest. That is almost five stone heavier than what Joshua weighed in at ahead of his victory over Alexander Povetkin in September. Miller - nicknamed 'Big Baby' - won 20 of his fights by knockout but Joshua represents a huge step-up in class. Joshua said: ""I am heading to the Big Apple and I plan to embrace the culture and leave with an appetite for more. ""It has been an honour and a blessing to fight at some of the best venues in the world and at home in the UK, not least Wembley Stadium, but the time has come to head across the Atlantic and defend my heavyweight titles in the USA. ""I am looking forward to taking on another challenge with a good boxer and a brilliant talker. It will be an exciting fight. I will leave nothing to chance and plan on dismantling Miller in style to make my mark."" Miller added: ""AJ is making a huge mistake coming over here to fight me in my own backyard - he'll be leaving New York empty-handed. ""This is the fight that I've been chasing all my life and on 1 June I'm going to achieve the thing I was born to do."" Miller has 19 wins in a row following a draw in 2013 Miller made his debut in a bout at a restaurant 10 years ago and, while he has wins over the likes of compatriot Gerald Washington and Poland's Mariusz Wach to his name, most UK sports fans will probably know little of his career. Joshua has been left with few options given fellow Briton Tyson Fury and WBC champion Deontay Wilder are set for a rematch, while Dillian Whyte has openly criticised the financial offer Joshua's team presented him with for a 13 April bout. Joshua had Wembley Stadium booked for the date where he had hoped to face Wilder, but has scrapped the booking in favour of a US debut. ""Things happen, boxing politics,"" he said. ""We had to branch out and look for other options."" A contest in the US has been seen by Joshua's advisers as a chance to enhance his global appeal. Britain's Lennox Lewis boxed at Madison Square Garden three times, while greats such as Muhammad Ali, Evander Holyfield and Sugar Ray Robinson have also competed there. There will undoubtedly be criticism of the move, given the public clamour for him to face Fury or Wilder in a bout that would unify all four belts. Negotiations have repeatedly failed with Wilder, while the offers sent to both Fury and Whyte were deemed insufficient. Wilder and Fury are now set for a rematch following their 1 December draw, while Whyte will fight in the UK in April or May. Miller was not even listed by Joshuawhen he asked fans to vote,externalon his next move in September, when 53% of respondents wanted a Wilder fixture and 42% called for Fury. But the American - who has clashed with Joshua at a news conference before - can at least be expected to provide memorable sound bites when promoting the fight and give Joshua chance to increase his profile in the lucrative US pay-per-view market.

"Prime Minister SÃ¡nchez failed to get his budget through, which could prompt early elections Spain's Socialist government is widely expected to call a snap general election after failing to get its budget through parliament. Catalan separatists rejected Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez's bill after the government refused to discuss the region's right to self-determination. They voted with the conservatives, despite their different agendas. Mr SÃ¡nchez, in power since June, will announce a date for the vote after a cabinet meeting on Friday, reports say. The government's budget was rejected by 191 members out of the 350-seat parliament, with votes from the People's Party (PP) and Ciudadanos as well as Catalan separatists. Mr SÃ¡nchez leads a minority government, with just 84 seats in parliament. He is supported by a confidence-and-supply agreement and the support of a handful of smaller parties with competing interests. The PP is the largest party with 134 seats. Mr SÃ¡nchez became prime minister after his predecessor,Mariano Rajoy, from the PP was pushed out in a no-confidence vote over a corruption scandal. A new general election will be the third in five years in Spain, the eurozone's fourth-largest economy. Citing unnamed sources, Reuters news agency says 14 or 28 April are the most likely dates. Catalan pro-independence parties had insisted on a dialogue over independence for their region as the price for supporting the budget, but talks broke down last week. The government's stance remains that, according to the country's constitution, the nation is ""indissoluble"", and no part of it can secede from the whole. This video can not be played Outside the court, rival groups offered support - or scorn - for the accused Divisions were highlighted on Tuesday, when 12 Catalan separatist leaders and activists went on trial for rebellion and sedition over their unrecognised independence referendum in 2017. Mr SÃ¡nchez left parliament immediately after his defeat, smiling but silent. Mr SÃ¡nchez came under political pressure for his attempts to reach out to the Catalan politicians he needed to pass his budget. On Sunday,thousands of demonstrators marched in Madridin a pro-unity demonstration called by parties of the right, demanding fresh elections This video can not be played Protesters angered by the government's outreach to Catalan separatists call for new elections in Spain Long hours of negotiation and parliamentary debate failed to break the deadlock. Ahead of the vote, Finance Minister MarÃ­a JesÃºs Montero tried to appeal to economic sensibilities, labelling the budget's provisions for Catalonia as generous. But she also called the insistence on independence talks a form of ""blackmail"". Mr Sanchez's party still leads opinion polls but a possible result could be a right-wing majority formed by the PP, Ciudadanos and a newly-emerged far-right party, Vox. Discontent in Spain over the Catalan issue wasone of the key factors behind the Socialists' defeatin regional elections in Andalusia in December to a right-wing coalition supported by Vox.

"Sajid Javid, the home secretary, wants to introduce new laws to stop social media being used to fuel knife crime. He's told Newsbeat he doesn't have what he needs to crack down on things that fuel gang disputes - despite the laws which exist to remove terrorism content and child sex abuse images from online. ""A couple of years back the internet companies were not taking it seriously enough to remove this content from the internet,"" says Sajid Javid. He wants them to do more. The home secretary says he told major online brands that they need to introduce better tools to monitor content which could result in criminal activity, like knife crime. ""After lots of pressure from this government and the US government I went over to the US myself and spoke to the five tech giants. ""I said you need to do more, use your own technology to sweep the 'net and find these videos and take them down. ""They are doing an incredible job today and I want to see them employing the same emphasis to that [knife and gang-related] content too."" And Sajid Javid says he's concerned about knife crime as both a politician and a father. ""My eldest daughter has started going out more than she used to,"" he says. ""But I do worry and there are some nights that I've stayed up into the early hours of the morning waiting for her to get back home."" Police matters and national security are part of the home secretary's job The home secretary was speaking just weeks after he introduced new powers to control suspects thought to be carrying knives. Knife Crime Prevention Orders were criticised by some who said that they targeted young children. Drill music has been linked to knife crime and some artists have alreadybeen given prison sentencesfor performing music which incited violence against rival gang members. The Metropolitan Police recently worked with YouTube to have videos deemed to be inciting gang rivalries removed. But it took Newsbeat 30 seconds looking for one of the ""banned"" videos online which we played to the home secretary. He said he needs new laws to help with this. ""My message to these companies is we are going to legislate - and how far we go depends on what you decide to do now,"" he says. But experts it's more likely that police will be given new powers to regulate what we post on social media, rather than any specific law that restricts people sharing knife crime content. ""The home secretary is right when he says there's no specific legislation that easily lets you pull down knife crime content from social media,"" says Steve Kuncewicz, from the law firm BLM, who also speaks for the Law Society. ""There's a general push to greater regulation of social media - what is often known as the internet ASBO. ""We're probably going to see new laws that make it easier for the police to remove this content."" Police getting new powers over what we post on social media is a worry for some civil liberty campaigners. ""The solution to reducing crime doesn't lie with alarmist legislation that risks suppressing creative expression,"" Rosalind Comyn, Policy and Campaigns Officer at Liberty tells Newsbeat. ""It perpetuates the marginalisation of minority communities and diverts attention from the root causes of violence. ""Incitement to violence is already a criminal offence, and the police have a lot of powers to enforce it. ""We urge the home secretary to change course and consult widely on rights-based, effective approaches to addressing serious violence."" The reason this conversation is happening now is because there were 285 fatal stabbings in England and Wales last year - that's thehighest since records beganin 1946. This video can not be played Robert Bragg thinks tougher sentences would have stopped him A former gang member Robert Bragg,who first carried and used a knife at the age of 12, agrees there needs to be a big change. The 26-year-old served six years in prison for a range of gang-related crime. He's now part of a programme to encourage school children not to get involved with knives. ""Stricter measures do need to be put in place so people cannot release footages of people calling people out, bragging about knife crime and violence. ""Back in my day if I was listening to drill music I'm riding out 24/7. ""If I was listening to drill music everyday - the way it is now - I'm definitely committing crime. ""In London it's normal. It's just one of things: you wake up, you have your breakfast, you stab someone."" YouTube explained its stance on knife crime content: ""We have developed policies specifically to help tackle videos related to knife crime in the UK and are continuing to work constructively with experts on this issue,"" it said. ""We have a dedicated process for the police to flag videos directly to our teams because we often need specialist context from law enforcement to identify real-life threats. ""We do not want our platform used to incite violence."" Follow Newsbeat onInstagram,external,Facebook,externalandTwitter,external.

"This video can not be played Zofija Kaczan death: 100-year-old's killer caught on CCTV A mugger has been found guilty of killing a 100-year-old woman whose neck was broken in a handbag robbery. Zofija Kaczan died of pneumonia on 6 June in Normanton, Derby, days after the attack. Mrs Kaczan was robbed near her home in Empress Road, Normanton, on 28 May as she made her way to church. Artur Waszkiewicz, 40, of Wolfa Street, Derby, had denied manslaughter and robbery but was convicted at Derby Crown Court. Police said Artur Waszkiewicz ""showed absolutely no concern for Mrs Kaczan"" Heroin addict Waszkiewicz knocked his victim to the floor, took her handbag and left her to bleed in the middle of the road. Polish-born Mrs Kaczan, who survived a Nazi camp during the Second World War, suffered multiple injuries, including a fractured neck and cheekbone. She later died of pneumonia brought on by the injuries. Latest news and stories from the East Midlands Det Ch Insp Darren De'ath from Derbyshire Police said: ""This was a horrendous crime that shocked me, my colleagues, the community in which it happened and indeed the whole country. ""Mrs Kaczan survived the Nazi occupation of Poland before coming to Derby in 1948 to start her life afresh."" He added the victim was in ""remarkable health"" and was seen ""regularly walking to the church close to her home"". Mrs Kaczan, described as a grandmother with a heart of gold, suffered multiple injuries in the attack St Maksymilian Kolbe, the church Mrs Kaczan attended, said she was an active member of their community who enjoyed shopping, having her hair done and attending lunches at the Polish Centre followed by bingo. A spokeswoman said she had a ""very difficult early life"" but had found ""stability and tranquillity"" in Derby. ""That tranquillity was shattered by the brutal events of 28 May 2018,"" the spokeswoman added. ""Despite the pain and suffering that she was in for the last week of her life, she had the capacity to pray for her attacker before she died."" Zofija Kaczan prayed for her attacker before she died The jury deliberated for just over two hours before unanimously convicting Waszkiewicz. The defendant, wearing a black velvet jacket and velvet slipper shoes, looked straight ahead and showed no emotion as the verdicts were delivered. He was caught on CCTV driving a Seat Leon before robbing Mrs Kaczan - slowing down as soon as he saw a ""small, vulnerable"" woman on her own. He needed an ""easy target"" to steal from so he could meet a drug dealer a short time later to buy heroin. A receipt with Artur Waszkiewicz's fingerprint on it was found in the stolen bag, the jury heard After the bag-snatch, Waszkiewicz fled to London and hid under a bed at his mother's house to try to avoid arrest. He had also cut his long hair and changed the insurance details on his car. He was arrested after his fingerprint was recovered from a receipt in the handbag. Waszkiewicz, who was also born in Poland, was so desperate for cash to feed his addiction he had tried to sell his dog and asked a neighbour for money in the past. He had previous convictions for shoplifting, creating false identification documents and battery. He is due to be sentenced on Thursday.

"This video can not be played Should boys be allowed to play netball? Boys have been banned from a national netball competition, meaning many who have trained all year will miss out. The Urdd National Sports Festival takes place in Aberystwyth in May and primary schools were told two weeks ago. Organisers said it was aimed at encouraging more girls to take part while boys' physical strength sometimes put them at an advantage. But girls will be able to play in the football competition with boys at the same tournament. Urdd Gobaith Cymru was set up in 1922 to provide opportunities for children through the medium of Welsh. The sports festival is one of many annual events it puts on. Ysgol San Sior, in Llandudno, Conwy, won the county tournament last year and competed in the national competition. Pupils at the school have criticised the move. ""Netball isn't just for girls, it's for boys and girls,"" said Mason, 10. ""If they're taking away netball from the boys, why don't they take a sport away from the girls?"" Ryley, also 10, said the move deprived boys of a new sport, adding: ""I'm normally a football person, but I wanted to try something different."" ""If girls are allowed to play football, why can't boys play netball?"" said Florence, 10. Gender stereotypes: Teen called lesbian for playing football The 12-year-old girl who was banned from playing football Find out how you can get into netball Teacher Lisa Jones said the school still planned to enter a team but it would now include girls from younger years. She described the ban as ""a bit of a shock"", adding: ""As far back as I can remember, we've been allowed to take boys to the tournament."" Pupils wrote to organisers, saying how disappointed they were. A statement from the Urdd said: ""There is a significant gender gap in sports participation between boys and girls. ""Through offering an all-girls tournament with a clear pathway for continued participation we are actively taking steps to close the gender gap in sports participation."" Organisers said they will review the move before the tournament in 2020 It added there had been complaints boys had been placed in ""key areas"" of the court where their ""physical and athletic presence is an advantage"". With the competition open to years five and six, the age gap could be from nine to 11-year-olds. Organisers said they will review how the competition goes before making a decision about 2020. Welsh Netball's chief executive Sarah Jones said the rules of netball state it can be played by same gender or mixed gender teams. But she added: ""Netball is one of the few team sports to attract girls and women to participate in particularly large numbers, which contributes to address the global disparity in sports participation."" Ms Jones said there had never been a demand for boy to play before, calling this ""a whole new territory"". ""I think it's an exciting time for the sport, that it is now starting to attract the attention of boys,"" she said. Teen called lesbian for playing football Banned from playing football.

""To fit in more you had to do certain things so I started to stab people. I didn't do it because I wanted to be bad."" Robert Bragg was once heavily involved in the world of knife crime. The 26-year-old served six years in prison for a range of gang-related crime and tells Radio 1 Newsbeat he believes tougher sentences would have encouraged him to change his ways a lot earlier. He's now part of a programme to encourage school children not to get involved with knife crime. ""I did it because I wanted the older lot to like me and because I thought it was the right thing to do at the time. ""To be honest with you, I've stabbed quite a lot of people. ""If I was to sit here and count I wouldn't be able to. People remind me, to this day, about people I've stabbed that I don't remember. ""We wanted to be bad - look bad, become the gang that everyone feared. We had to carry out a lot of violent crimes to become that gang.

"Claire wants to raise awareness about HPV and cervical cancer Having human papilloma virus (HPV) is not rude or shameful and is extremely common, experts say. It comes as a survey of 2,000 women shows there are still stigmas around the infection, which can be passed on during sex and is linked to cancer. Charities are concerned this could put women off getting smear tests. Despite four out of every five getting HPV in their lifetime, many would worry about what their partner might think of them if they were diagnosed with it. In the survey by Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust, nearly half said they would be worried about telling their partners. Half would wonder who had given it to them and a similar number would worry it meant that their partner had been unfaithful. Amanda needed surgery after delaying having a smear test Amanda Blood, 28, was diagnosed with cervical cancer after putting off having a smear test. Her doctors told her she also had HPV. ""At first I was really angry at my ex. I'd only ever slept with two people,"" she said. ""But when I read more about HPV, I understood that it is actually really common and you shouldn't hold anyone responsible for it."" There are more than 100 different types of HPV - the name given to a very common group of viruses. Some 'high-risk' types of HPV can cause changes to the cells in the cervix, which can lead to cervical cancer if not treated. These abnormal cells are what smear tests pick up. Genital HPV can be caught from skin-on-skin contact, meaning you don't have to have full sex to be at risk. Oral sex and intimate touching can also pass on the infection, which lives on the skin. Claire Bolton was 38 when she was diagnosed with cervical cancer. At the time, she had never heard of HPV. ""I wasn't given any information about it,"" she said. ""Everything I found out was from what I read for myself on websites and forums and it was quite shocking to read about. ""It's such a common infection yet there's still a stigma attached to it and you do start questioning things. ""I was in a long-term relationship with a person that I didn't really trust at that time. ""But you can have HPV for years and not know it. ""It is a really easy thing to get, so you shouldn't be embarrassed."" Most of the time, people will not realise that they have HPV because they will not have any symptoms or complications. Your immune system usually gets rid of HPV without treatment. But some strains or types of HPV (there are lots of different ones) can cause genital warts. Others are linked to cancer. This video can not be played Chloe Delevingne had a smear test live on the Victoria Derbyshire programme In the survey, a third of women were unaware of the link to cervical cancer and most did not know that it could cause throat and mouth cancer. Girls are already offered a free vaccine to help protect against HPV. And the NHS isadding HPV testing to cervical cancer screening,external, meaning women will be checked for it when they have a smear. If they have it, they can have other tests and treatment if they need it to hopefully avoid a cancer from growing. Cervical cancer is the most common cancer in women aged 35 and under, with some having no symptoms. Genital warts mean you will get cancer - No. Warts are caused by a different type of HPV I haven't had lots of sex, so I probably won't have it - Wrong. Having HPV isn't a sign that someone has slept with a lot of people or been unfaithful to a partner. You can get it during your first sexual contact - whether that is touching, penetrative sex, oral sex or sharing sex toys We use condoms, so I'm totally protected - Wrong. Using condoms reduces the risk but not entirely My current partner must have given it to me - Not necessarily. HPV can stay undetected in the body for years. It is very common and for most people it will never cause a problem I've had the vaccine so I can't get it - No. Although the HPV vaccine protects against seven out of 10 cases of cervical cancer, it does not offer complete protection. So, even if you have had the HPV vaccine, it is very important to attend cervical screening Robert Music, chief executive of Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust, who will be talking about the survey findings at Cancer Research UK's Early Diagnosis conference, said: ""We must address the level of misunderstanding that exists around HPV. ""Most people will get the virus in their lifetime, so it is worrying to see such high levels of fear or shame associated with it."" Sara Hiom, from Cancer Research UK, said: ""Busting the myths and removing the stigmas surrounding HPV is vital to ensure people feel more confident to book and turn up for their cervical screening appointment."" HPV doesn't just affect women. It can also cause a number of different types of cancer in men, such as cancer of the penis, anal cancer and some types of head and neck cancer. Tony believes he contracted the virus while living ""a wild lifestyle"" as a teenager Tony Kimberley was diagnosed with penile cancer in March 2013. He says he knew nothing about the virus when it was first mentioned to him and spoke to his wife and daughter to find out more. ""Men need to be more aware about what's going on with their bodies and the effects of HPV,"" said Tony. ""There are serious consequences to leaving HPV untreated and many people will not know they have it."" The government has agreed that boys aged 12-13 should be offered an HPV vaccine to protect them against cancer.

"UK inflation fell to a two-year low in January, dragged lower by falling energy bills and fuel. The Office for National Statistics said the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) was 1.8% last month, from 2.1% in December. January's fall, partly offset by higher air and ferry fares, was bigger than economists' forecasts and comes as latest data shows wages rising by 3.3%. Inflation peaked at a five-year high of 3.1% in November 2017, and was last at 1.8% was in January 2017. Economists had forecast that CPI would fall in January to 2%, the Bank of England's inflation target. Mike Hardie, ONS head of inflation, said: ""The fall in inflation is due mainly to cheaper gas, electricity and petrol, partly offset by rising ferry ticket prices and air fares falling more slowly than this time last year."" Ofgem's energy price cap, which came into effect from 1 January 2019, helped drive down inflation, the ONS said. However, that cap is being raised and this is likely to feed into future CPI figures. Price of flats fell in England last year The ONS said that petrol prices were also down by 2.1% per litre between December 2018 and January 2019 due to falling crude oil prices. Hotel and restaurant prices were also lower while prices of women's and children's clothing saw larger price drops than a year earlier. As wages are rising at 3.3%, Tej Parikh, senior economist at the Institute of Directors, said the lower inflation was a ""boon"" for the economy as it attempts to weather the effects of uncertainty. ""For the past two years, households have been squeezed between high prices and weak wage growth. With inflation now at a two-year low and growing upward momentum in pay packets, consumers are likely to feel less of a pinch on their wallets. ""This easing in the cost of living should provide some uplift for the High Street just as consumer confidence appears to be waning,"" Mr Parikh said. Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, also highlighted the potential relief for retailers. He said falling inflation alongside rising earnings was ""delivering a powerful uplift to spending power"". ""Brexit dominates at the moment but were Brexit risks to ease, consumers would be well placed to hit the High Street,"" he added. Some economists think it is unlikely that inflation will fall much more. For instance, Ofgem's energy price cap may not suppress inflation for long, as the cap is due to rise in April. Andrew Wishart, UK economist at Capital Economics, said: ""The fall in CPI inflation below the Bank of England's 2% target for the first time in two years in January provides a further boost to households' real spending power, but we doubt inflation will fall any further."" Much could depend on the course of the Brexit negotiations, according to Howard Archer, chief economic advisor to the EY Item Club. ""Domestic inflationary pressures are expected to pick-up only modestly over the coming months amid likely limited UK growth,"" said Mr Archer. Assuming there is a Brexit deal, he said inflation could stay below 2% this year - and even dip to 1.6%. If there is not a deal, Mr Archer said the picture would be different and the Bank of England could cut interest rates as ""economic activity would likely take a significant hit"". We are used to hearing that our living standards have been hit by a nasty combination of above-target inflation, driven by rising energy prices, and weak pay rises. So it's refreshing to hear that has gone into reverse. The biggest driver of lower inflation, now below the Bank of England's 2% target for the first time in two years, was energy. Gas and electricity prices fell, between December 2018 and January 2019, by 8.5% and 4.9%. The price cap had an effect (although prices may soon rise as the cap rises). But there's also little inflationary pressure coming down the pipeline - for example, from higher raw material costs for producers. With pay, at the last count, rising by 3.3% living standards are now rising faster than they have since November 2016. Just because, collectively, we are now in an economic slowdown, doesn't mean we each, individually, are getting worse off. Economists would usually expect higher wages and a lower unemployment rate -data last month showed job vacancies are at a record high of 853,000- to push up the rate of price increases. Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the data showed the ""continued breakdown of the relationship between the labour market and inflation"". ""Theory dictates that a tight labour market, low unemployment and higher wage growth, should lead to higher inflation. This means policymakers face a straight trade-off between inflation and unemployment. ""But at present the inflation genie is still firmly in the bottle, despite unemployment at multi-decade lows. This has made the Bank of England's job much easier over the past few years,"" Mr Brettell said.

"This video can not be played Maria Ressa says the rule of law was broken when she was arrested The CEO of Rappler, a news website critical of the government in the Philippines, has been arrested at its headquarters in Manila. Maria Ressa has been accused of ""cyber-libel"" over a report on a businessman's alleged ties to a former judge. Press freedom advocates see this as an attempt by the government to silence the news organisation. President Rodrigo Duterte has previously denied charges against her are politically motivated. This is the latest in a string of different allegations against Ms Ressa, whose website has been described as ""fake news"" by Mr Duterte. The latest charge against Ms Ressa stems from a seven-year-old report on a businessman's alleged ties to a former judge in the Philippines' top court. The case comes under a controversial ""cyber-libel"" law, which came into force in September 2012, four months after the article in question was published. Officials first filed the case against her in 2017, but it was initially dismissed by the NBI because the one-year limit for bringing libel cases had lapsed. However, in March 2018,the NBI reopened the case,external. This arrest comes just two months after Ms Ressa posted bail on tax fraud charges, which she says are also ""manufactured"". If she is convicted of just one count of tax fraud, she could serve up to a decade in prison. The cyber-libel charge carries a maximum sentence of 12 years. Speaking to reporters after her arrest, the veteran journalist said she was ""shocked that the rule of law has been broken to a point that I can't see it"". Footage streamed on Facebook,externalshowed plain-clothes party officials speaking with Maria Ressa, while several of the site's journalists live-tweeted what was happening. Officers from the National Bureau of Investigations (NBI) reportedly ordered them to stop filming and taking photos. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Miriam Grace Go, Rappler's news editor, latertweeted that NBI agents had led Ms Ressa out of Rappler's offices,external. After the arrest, the site's staff had focused their efforts on finding a judge who would allow her to post bail, despite it being the evening. However, reporter Sofia Tomacruz tweeted that the judge had refused their request, meaning that Ms Ressa will have to spend the night in jail. Allow Twitter content?

Chay HofileÃ±a, Rappler's head of investigative journalism, had told BBC News that this was their main concern. ""Maria is currently at the National Bureau of Investigations, and we're hoping that she'll be able to file bail tonight, so that she won't have to spend the night there,"" she said. ""We will have to find a judge at a night court who will be willing to grant bail. Our lawyers are currently in the process of finding one."" Ms HofileÃ±a added that ""if she's able to post bail, then she's free"" and they could focus on their case and the legal process. Howard Johnson, BBC News, Manila Journalists must ""hold the line"" against government attacks, that's what Maria Ressa told me when I interviewed her recently about press freedom in the Philippines. She says politically-motivated legal cases and online troll attacks are being used to try to ""bludgeon the media into silence"". Journalists, including myself, have been at the sharp end of numerous threats by supporters of President Rodrigo Duterte. One post under a Facebook link to a documentary about the president read: ""Howard, watch your back"". Next to it was a skull and cross bones emoji. The president's supporters accuse Rappler and other news organisations of being biased against him. They say too much attention is paid to his bloody drug war and not enough to his other achievements while in office. With multiple cases against Maria Ressa and Rappler, long-drawn-out local court hearings are expected. But with Time magazine awarding Maria Ressa Person of the Year 2018 for her journalism, the world's eyes will be on the Philippine justice system to see which way it rules. Read more from Howard: Why Rappler case raises press freedom fears Rappler was founded in 2012 by Ms Ressa and three other journalists. Since then it has become known in the Philippines for its hard-hitting investigations. It is also one of the few media organisations in the country that is openly critical of President Duterte, regularly interrogating the accuracy of his public statements and criticising his sometimes deadly policies. Philippine journalist: Tax charges are fake In particular, Rappler has published a number of reports critical of Mr Duterte's war on drugs, in which police say around 5,000 people have been killed in the last three years. In December, it also reported on his public admissionthat he sexually assaulted a maid. The president insists that the site's reporting is ""fake news"", and has banned its reporters from covering his official activities. Last year,the state revoked the site's licence- but Mr Duterte denied that the claims against Rappler and Ms Ressa are politically motivated. Ms Ressa says the arrest is an attempt to silence Rappler's journalism. Ms Ressa is a veteran Philippine journalist who, before founding Rappler, spent most of her career with CNN - first as the bureau chief in Manila, and then in Jakarta. She was also the US broadcaster's lead investigative reporter on terrorism in Southeast Asia. She has won many international awards for her reporting, and was named a Time Magazine Person of the Year in 2018 for her work holding power to account in an increasingly hostile environment. The National Union of Journalists of the Philippines has been swift in its condemnation. ""The arrest of... Ressa on the clearly manipulated charge of cyber-libel is a shameless act of persecution by a bully government,"" the union told Reuters. ""The government... now proves it will go to ridiculous lengths to forcibly silence critical media."" Meanwhile, Rappler's reporters have been tweeting about the arrest with the hashtag #DefendPressFreedom. Observers say that press freedom in the Philippines - once one of the strongest in Asia - has been weakened under Mr Duterte's presidency. Since 1986, 176 journalists have been killed in the country, making it one of the most dangerous in the world for reporters. In 2016,the president was criticised for saying some of those journalists deserved to die.

"PC Mick Johnson: ""It's incredibly frustrating not being able to do the job that I still love."" The day PC Mick Johnson confronted a knifeman changed his life forever. Stabbed in the arm in the 2017 incident in Hartlepool, it left him suffering post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). He says staff shortages caused by cutbacks left him no choice but to operate alone that day. A Police Federation of England and Wales (PFEW) survey found nearly 90% of officers say they are under-staffed. The Home Office says it wants to ensure forces have the necessary resources. The PFEW survey is the only national policing study of its kind, and 18,000 officers of all ranks took part. The first one was conducted in 2016. The survey also found: 79% of officers have experienced feelings of stress and anxiety in the previous 12 months, with 94% of those saying their job made it worse Almost every officer has been exposed to at least one traumatic experience in their career, with 61.7% suffering at least one in the last 12 months 43.9% reported they viewed their job as very or extremely stressful, up from 38.6% in 2016 PC Johnson's confrontation with that knifeman two years ago utterly changed him as a person.

"Unions says Ford aims to cut 1,000 jobs at Bridgend by 2021 Ford has said a no-deal Brexit would be catastrophic for the firm's manufacturing operations in the UK and that it would do ""whatever is necessary"" to protect its business. The comments come after a report the carmaker was stepping up preparations to move production out of the UK. Ford declined to comment directly on The Times' report, but said it had long warned against a ""hard Brexit"". The company is the latest carmaker to warn on the risks of a no-deal Brexit. ""Such a situation would be catastrophic for the UK auto industry and Ford's manufacturing operations in the country,"" the company said in a statement. ""We will take whatever action is necessary to preserve the competitiveness of our European business."" 1,000 Bridgend Ford job cuts outlined Jaguar Land Rover confirms 4,500 job cuts Toyota urges support for PM's Brexit deal Ford employs 13,000 people in the UK at sites in Bridgend, Dagenham, Halewood and Dunton. According to The Times' report,external, the firm told Prime Minister Theresa May on a telephone call with business leaders that it was preparing alternative sites abroad. During the call Mrs May confirmed reports that the government was preparing a package of financial support for businesses affected by a no-deal Brexit but declined to elaborate, The Times said. Other companies on the call delivered the same warning as Ford, the report said. Ford is the latest carmaker to sound the alarm on Brexit after Nissan said last week it would no longer build its X-Trail car in Sunderland, in part because of Brexit uncertainty. In January, Jaguar Land Rover, the UK's biggest carmaker, said it would cut 4,500 jobs in the UK, citing geopolitical issues, regulatory disruptions, and Brexit uncertainty. Toyota has also urged the government to avoid a no-deal scenario. In addition to Brexit worries, the car industry faces a slump in sales of diesel cars and a slowdown in China. Last month, the Unite union saidFord aimed to cut almost 1,000 jobs at its Bridgend plant by 2021because of challenging market conditions. The carmaker declined to confirm the figures but said it was consulting with unions. The government has said the best way to provide certainty to industry is for MPs to back the prime minister's Brexit deal.

"PC Mick Johnson: ""It's incredibly frustrating not being able to do the job that I still love."" The day PC Mick Johnson confronted a knifeman changed his life forever. Stabbed in the arm in the 2017 incident in Hartlepool, it left him suffering post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). He says staff shortages caused by cutbacks left him no choice but to operate alone that day. A Police Federation of England and Wales (PFEW) survey found nearly 90% of officers say they are under-staffed. The Home Office says it wants to ensure forces have the necessary resources. The PFEW survey is the only national policing study of its kind, and 18,000 officers of all ranks took part. The first one was conducted in 2016. The survey also found: 79% of officers have experienced feelings of stress and anxiety in the previous 12 months, with 94% of those saying their job made it worse Almost every officer has been exposed to at least one traumatic experience in their career, with 61.7% suffering at least one in the last 12 months 43.9% reported they viewed their job as very or extremely stressful, up from 38.6% in 2016 PC Johnson's confrontation with that knifeman two years ago utterly changed him as a person. ""I was off [work] for only three weeks, but later suffered from mood swings, short temper and lack of sleep,"" he said. ""I eventually sought help and was diagnosed with PTSD.

"This video can not be played Maria Ressa says the rule of law was broken when she was arrested The CEO of Rappler, a news website critical of the government in the Philippines, has been arrested at its headquarters in Manila. Maria Ressa has been accused of ""cyber-libel"" over a report on a businessman's alleged ties to a former judge. Press freedom advocates see this as an attempt by the government to silence the news organisation. President Rodrigo Duterte has previously denied charges against her are politically motivated. This is the latest in a string of different allegations against Ms Ressa, whose website has been described as ""fake news"" by Mr Duterte. The latest charge against Ms Ressa stems from a seven-year-old report on a businessman's alleged ties to a former judge in the Philippines' top court. The case comes under a controversial ""cyber-libel"" law, which came into force in September 2012, four months after the article in question was published. Officials first filed the case against her in 2017, but it was initially dismissed by the NBI because the one-year limit for bringing libel cases had lapsed. However, in March 2018,the NBI reopened the case,external. This arrest comes just two months after Ms Ressa posted bail on tax fraud charges, which she says are also ""manufactured"". If she is convicted of just one count of tax fraud, she could serve up to a decade in prison. The cyber-libel charge carries a maximum sentence of 12 years. Speaking to reporters after her arrest, the veteran journalist said she was ""shocked that the rule of law has been broken to a point that I can't see it"". Footage streamed on Facebook,externalshowed plain-clothes party officials speaking with Maria Ressa, while several of the site's journalists live-tweeted what was happening. Officers from the National Bureau of Investigations (NBI) reportedly ordered them to stop filming and taking photos. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Miriam Grace Go, Rappler's news editor, latertweeted that NBI agents had led Ms Ressa out of Rappler's offices,external. After the arrest, the site's staff had focused their efforts on finding a judge who would allow her to post bail, despite it being the evening. However, reporter Sofia Tomacruz tweeted that the judge had refused their request, meaning that Ms Ressa will have to spend the night in jail. Allow Twitter content?

Chay HofileÃ±a, Rappler's head of investigative journalism, had told BBC News that this was their main concern. ""Maria is currently at the National Bureau of Investigations, and we're hoping that she'll be able to file bail tonight, so that she won't have to spend the night there,"" she said. ""We will have to find a judge at a night court who will be willing to grant bail. Our lawyers are currently in the process of finding one."" Ms HofileÃ±a added that ""if she's able to post bail, then she's free"" and they could focus on their case and the legal process. Howard Johnson, BBC News, Manila Journalists must ""hold the line"" against government attacks, that's what Maria Ressa told me when I interviewed her recently about press freedom in the Philippines. She says politically-motivated legal cases and online troll attacks are being used to try to ""bludgeon the media into silence"". Journalists, including myself, have been at the sharp end of numerous threats by supporters of President Rodrigo Duterte. One post under a Facebook link to a documentary about the president read: ""Howard, watch your back"". Next to it was a skull and cross bones emoji. The president's supporters accuse Rappler and other news organisations of being biased against him. They say too much attention is paid to his bloody drug war and not enough to his other achievements while in office. With multiple cases against Maria Ressa and Rappler, long-drawn-out local court hearings are expected. But with Time magazine awarding Maria Ressa Person of the Year 2018 for her journalism, the world's eyes will be on the Philippine justice system to see which way it rules. Read more from Howard: Why Rappler case raises press freedom fears Rappler was founded in 2012 by Ms Ressa and three other journalists. Since then it has become known in the Philippines for its hard-hitting investigations. It is also one of the few media organisations in the country that is openly critical of President Duterte, regularly interrogating the accuracy of his public statements and criticising his sometimes deadly policies. Philippine journalist: Tax charges are fake In particular, Rappler has published a number of reports critical of Mr Duterte's war on drugs, in which police say around 5,000 people have been killed in the last three years. In December, it also reported on his public admissionthat he sexually assaulted a maid. The president insists that the site's reporting is ""fake news"", and has banned its reporters from covering his official activities. Last year,the state revoked the site's licence- but Mr Duterte denied that the claims against Rappler and Ms Ressa are politically motivated. Ms Ressa says the arrest is an attempt to silence Rappler's journalism. Ms Ressa is a veteran Philippine journalist who, before founding Rappler, spent most of her career with CNN - first as the bureau chief in Manila, and then in Jakarta. She was also the US broadcaster's lead investigative reporter on terrorism in Southeast Asia. She has won many international awards for her reporting, and was named a Time Magazine Person of the Year in 2018 for her work holding power to account in an increasingly hostile environment. The National Union of Journalists of the Philippines has been swift in its condemnation. ""The arrest of... Ressa on the clearly manipulated charge of cyber-libel is a shameless act of persecution by a bully government,"" the union told Reuters. ""The government... now proves it will go to ridiculous lengths to forcibly silence critical media."" Meanwhile, Rappler's reporters have been tweeting about the arrest with the hashtag #DefendPressFreedom. Observers say that press freedom in the Philippines - once one of the strongest in Asia - has been weakened under Mr Duterte's presidency. Since 1986, 176 journalists have been killed in the country, making it one of the most dangerous in the world for reporters. In 2016,the president was criticised for saying some of those journalists deserved to die.

"Theresa May has played down reports that she could force MPs to choose between backing her deal or accepting a delay to EU withdrawal. ITV News said,externalchief UK negotiator Olly Robbins was overheard in a Brussels bar saying the EU was likely to allow an extension to the Brexit process. The PM suggested MPs should not rely on ""what someone said to someone else as overheard by someone else, in a bar"". ""It is very clear the government's position is the same,"" she said. ""We triggered Article 50 (the process by which the UK leaves the EU)... that had a two-year time limit, that ends on the 29 March. ""We want to leave with a deal, and that's what we are working for."" Prime Minister's Questions: The verdict No-deal Brexit plan for Channel Tunnel Kuenssberg: Will May delay vote to last minute? Commons Live: MPs discuss trade deals The prime minister has said she will lift the requirement for a 21-day period before any vote to approve an international treaty, which means she could delay the final Brexit vote until days before the UK is due to leave the EU. No 10 insists Mrs May still plans to hold a vote on a deal as soon as possible but Labour has accused her of ""running down the clock"" in an effort to ""blackmail"" MPs into backing her deal. And European Council President Donald Tusk tweeted that ""no news is not always good news"", saying the EU was ""still waiting for concrete, realistic proposals from London"". Allow Twitter content?

At Prime Minister's Questions, the SNP's Westminster Leader Ian Blackford urged Mrs May to rule out holding a ""meaningful vote"" on the deal with less than two weeks to go until Brexit. ""The prime minister must stop playing fast and loose - businesses are begging for certainty,"" he said. Mrs May said the way to give businesses certainty was to back the deal she had negotiated with the EU. But Mr Blackford told her she had been ""rumbled by your own loose-lipped senior Brexit adviser"". It was a reference to the ITV report that Mr Robbins was overheard saying he expected MPs to be presented with a choice of backing either a reworked withdrawal deal, or a potentially significant delay to Brexit. MPs rejected the deal negotiated with the EU by a historic margin in January and the prime minister says she is seeking legally-binding changes to the controversial ""backstop"" - the ""insurance policy"" aimed at avoiding a return to border checks between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer says MPs would force the PM to delay Brexit, rather than accept a no-deal scenario The UK is currently due to leave the EU on 29 March, whether or not a deal has been approved by the Commons. On Wednesday, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn pointed to thedecision to scrap a no-deal Brexit contract with a ferry company that had no shipsas a ""spectacular failure"" which was ""a symptom of the utter shambles of this government and its no-deal preparations"". He described the prime minister's Brexit strategy as ""costly, shambolic and deliberately evasive"". Mrs May accused Mr Corbyn of preferring ""ambiguity and playing politics to acting in the national interest"" saying MPs did not know if he backed another referendum, a deal or Brexit. ""People used to say he was a conviction politician - not any more,"" she said. The PM has promised to return to the Commons on 26 February with a further statement - triggering another debate and votes the following day - if a deal has not been secured by that date. If a deal is agreed, MPs will have a second ""meaningful vote"", more than a month after Mrs May's deal was rejected in the first one. No 10 has indicated it is willing to make concessions on protection for workers but Labour's push for a closer future customs relationship than Mrs May proposes, remains a sticking point. Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer met Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington and Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay on Wednesday for what he described as ""frank and serious discussions"". But he said he was given ""no suggestion"" that the prime minister was ""diluting red lines"". He added that he had ""set out the Labour Party position, which is the two options: On one hand a close economic relationship, on the other a public vote"". He said the battle for now is ""to stop the prime minister running down the clock"". Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell has acknowledged that the prime minister cannot back Labour's Brexit proposals, and said he thinks Parliament is going to end up taking over the Brexit process. Asked at a Politico event on Wednesday how Labour was going to achieve its plans, including staying in a customs union, because, ""you know she can't back it... she'll split her party"", Mr Donnell replied: ""Yeah... yeah"". ""I genuinely think we're now into hard-nosed negotiations between pockets of support in all the different politics,"" he said. He accepted that the general election Labour has been calling for was ""unlikely"". Labour has tabled an amendment for Thursday that would force the government to come back to Parliament by the end of the month to hold a substantive vote in the Commons on its plan for Brexit. ""Our amendment says there should be a hard stop on February 26. The prime minister must either put up her deal or allow Parliament to take control,"" said Sir Keir. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Mrs May told MPs on Tuesday she was discussing a number of options with the EU to secure legally-binding changes to the backstop, including replacing it with ""alternative arrangements"", putting a time limit on how long it can stay in place, or a unilateral exit clause so the UK can leave it at a time of its choosing. MPs are due to vote again on the Brexit process on Thursday in what was expected to be a routine procedure acknowledging the government's efforts. Please upgrade your browser However, BBC political editor Laura Kuenssbergtweeted,externalthat Mrs May could be faced with another defeat, with influential Brexiteers from the European Research Group of Tory backbenchers indicating that they will refuse to back the government. They are angry at being asked to support the PM's motion, which combines the view backed by a majority of MPs last month that the government should seek an alternative to the backstop with a separate move to stop Brexit happening without a formal deal. How MPs aim to alter Brexit process Brexit: What could happen next? Brexit: A really simple guide The group's deputy chairman, Mark Francois, told the BBC members had ""pleaded"" with Downing Street to change the wording, which he said goes back on what she has previously told MPs. ""We cannot vote for this as it is currently configured because it rules out no deal and removes our negotiating leverage in Brussels."" Most MPs want to avoid a no-deal scenario, fearing chaos at ports and disruption to business. However, some Brexiteers have played down that prospect arguing it is an example of ""Project Fear"". Meanwhile, Labour have highlighted a government risk assessment that says ""precisely four"" of about 40 documents designed to replicate the existing 40 EU free trade agreements have been signed. The party's trade spokesman Barry Gardiner said of the agreements, which were promised to be ready immediately after Brexit: ""Nine are off-track, 19 significantly off-track, four are not possible to be completed by March 2019 and two are not even being negotiated."" International Trade Secretary Liam Fox responded: ""A number of negotiations are at an advanced stage. As with all international negotiations, and indeed any negotiations, they will go down to the wire."" Will PM delay vote to last minute?

"The claim:There are 21,000 fewer police officers. Reality Check verdict:That's about right - under the Conservative and coalition governments, the number of police officers has fallen by somewhere between 19,000 and 22,000. What's happening to policing and crime is a regular topic at Prime Minister's Questions, when Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn goes head-to-head with Theresa May. Mr Corbyn asked: ""With crime rising, does the prime minister regret cutting 21,000 police officers?"" Whether crime is rising or not is harder than you might imagine to determine. There's good evidence that certain types of violent crimes are rising but the overall amount of crime people report experiencing is falling. As of September 2017, there were 121,929 police officers in England and Wales, the lowest number in at least 20 years - policing in Scotland and Northern Ireland is a devolved issue. The latest figures show that between September 2010 and September 2017, the number of police officers in English and Welsh forces fell by 19,921 or 14%,according to the Home Office,external. Since September 2009 - the last set of figures before the Conservatives came into government in coalition with the Liberal Democrats - there's been a cut of 22,424 police officers. Numbers of police community support officers (PCSOs), who patrol the streets, have fallen by almost 40% during this period. As of March 2017, there were 6,278 authorised firearms officers in England and Wales, down from 6,976 in March 2010. The National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) says plans are in place to bring the number of armed police back up to about 7,000 this year. This is only partly funded by government - forces must find some of the cash themselves. Elsewhere in the UK, police numbers in Scotland have risen more or less continuously for the past 30 years while in Northern Ireland there has been a smaller decrease since 2010 than in England and Wales. Overall police budgets, excluding counter-terrorism grants, fell by 20% between 2010 and 2015. Since 2015, the overall policing budget has been protected in real terms, butnot every force will benefit. Over the same period, the ring-fenced counter-terrorism grant has been rising in line with inflation. The NPCC does not disclose counter-terrorism police officer numbers but there has been a large increase in counter-terrorism spending since a specific grant was introduced in 2001-02. How has armed policing changed? How this grant is shared out across police forces has not been made public in recent years for security reasons but the Metropolitan Police force is the national lead on counter-terrorism and is likely to receive a significant share. In autumn 2015, the then Chancellor George Osborne promised to spend Â£3.4bn extra on counter-terrorism - an increase of 30% - over the following five years. This was to be allocated to several different agencies working on counter-terrorism, not just police forces. Counter-terrorism policing operates as a network with bases across the UK and resources, including officers and other staff, can be allocated where the need is greatest.

"Metropolitan Police commissioner Cressida Dick believes being ""a bit different"" has encouraged others who ""feel different"" to join the force. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, Ms Dick, Britain's most senior police officer, said being female and openly gay made unlikely recruits think they too could ""have a go"" at policing. But she said her sexuality was ""one of the least interesting things about me"". She also said female police officers should make up half the force. She said: ""The fact that I am seen as a bit different in some respects, I realise, on some occasions, makes young people think 'I could have a go' or 'I might try; I feel different but I might try'."" She said she hoped the that a lot of women are among the new recruits, to ensure a more balanced male/female divide. ""In the long term, in order for us to have the best of the best, I would like it to be 50/50,"" she told Lauren Laverne, who hosts the show. But she added that she did not think it would be achieved during her tenure. Cressida Dick appointed as first female Met Police chief Met police chief: New job 'beyond my wildest dreams' Ms Dick recalled how she became a police officer at the age of 23, after a spell working in a fish and chip shop with a man who kept a baseball bat behind the counter. In the early days, she patrolled London's West End, including the Soho area - traditional home of London's sex trade. ""I loved the idea that at three or four in the morning it was just me there. ""That is the great thing about policing, you do have a lot of responsibility very early and you have got to make decisions - sometimes life-and-death decisions -  very quickly. ""There is something about putting a uniform on and thinking 'people are looking to me to make decisions and to look after them' that makes you feel capable."" She described the mistaken killing ofBrazilian electrician Jean Charles de Menezes- which happened during a counter-terrorism operation that she commanded - as ""an awful time"". Mr de Menezes, 27, was shot in the head at London's Stockwell Tube in 2005 by police who mistook him for a terror suspect. ""I think about it quite often,"" said Ms Dick, who was ultimately absolved of any blame. ""I wish, wish, wish it hadn't happened, of course, but if anything it has made me a better leader, a better police officer and it has made me more resilient."" Ms Dick picked tracks including In Private by Dusty Springfield and the hymn Lord Of All Hopefulness among the tunes to take to the desert island with her, and her book choice was the complete works of Thomas Hardy. Her choice of luxury item was soap. ""Scent is very important to me, but it is the case that my colleagues think it is hilarious that I simply cannot smell, ever, the smell of cannabis,"" she joked.

"This video can not be played More armed officers are needed on the frontline, a police chief says Senior police leaders have said a rise in gun crime and a looming recruitment shortfall are leaving some specialist armed officers ""stretched"". Figures have shown crimes of possessing firearms rose by 87% in England and Wales over the past five years. In 2015, the government set aside funds for 1,500 new armed officers by 2020 - but only 812 have so far been added. A police staff association leader said he had ""great concern"" that the risk to the public could be increased. Steve Hartshorn, the firearms lead for the Police Federation of England and Wales, said: ""With... fewer armed police officers to deal with armed criminality, it gives me great concern that at some point the public will be at increased risk because of lack of funding and a lack of police officers to protect them."" Home Office figures show the number of recorded possession of firearms offences in England and Wales jumped from 4,300 in 2012-13 to 8,039 in 2017-18, a rise of 87%. Only two police forces out of 44 - Avon and Somerset and South Wales - saw a fall in offences over the period, with Greater Manchester seeing the biggest rise in the actual number of offences - from 315 to 1,092, a rise of 247%. The latest figures available for firearm-related crimes, such as armed robberies, saw a rise of 24% from 5,158 in 2012-13 to about 6,300 in 2016-17. However, levels of gun crime were much higher before 2012, peaking at just over 11,000 recorded offences in March 2006. There was a long downward trend until 2014, when the number of offences started increasing again. In West Yorkshire, crimes involving a firearm rose from 253 to 439, up 74%, between 2012 and 2017. West Yorkshire Police Assistant Chief Constable Tim Kingsman said there were times when resources were stretched and he had no option but to make demands of the same people. He added: ""We're asking them at times to do 12-hour shifts, day after day after day, and that will stretch [them] physically, emotionally. ""In West Yorkshire we've seen a rise in the availability of firearms for use by criminals. ""Last year we did 896 firearms operations as West Yorkshire Police, which is quite a number. That's two or three a day."" Deputy Chief Constable Simon Chesterman said the pressure on armed officers was ""relentless"" In 2012 there were 6,756 armed officers across England and Wales. That fell to 5,639 in 2016 before increasing to 6,459 in 2018. Deputy Chief Constable Simon Chesterman, the National Police Chiefs Council spokesman for armed policing, said cuts to police numbers had a ""big impact"" on forces' capabilities. ""The demand is increasing without a doubt. It's relentless, dealing with gun crime, with knife crime, with terrorism, with serious organised crime,"" he said. ""They are responding to a range of threats on a daily basis. They're working overtime to keep up with demand. ""I'm concerned we haven't recruited as many as we wanted within the time that we wanted to but the one thing I would say, just to reassure you, is that we are delivering the effects."" Home Office security minister Ben Wallace said: ""The government has given Â£144m uplift for armed policing. ""The police are in charge of the recruiting, training and deployment of armed officers. ""It is disappointing that challenges facing the police have meant the targets agreed with the Home Office have not yet been delivered."" Reality Check: What has happened to police numbers?

"The body of an 80-year-old man was found in a house in Bonhay Road A man has been arrested on suspicion of murder after three men in their 80s - two of whom were believed to have been twins - were found dead. The bodies of two 84-year-olds, named locally as Dick and Roger Carter, were found in Exeter on Tuesday, a day after the body of an 80-year-old man was discovered. Police said the level of violence used against all three had led them to link the deaths. A 27-year-old man is in police custody. Officers were first called to Bonhay Road at 15:00 GMT on Monday, where they found the body of the 80-year-old. At 13:00 on Tuesday, police attended a property in Cowick Lane, about 1.5 miles (2.4km) away, and discovered the bodies of the two other men. Latest news from Devon and Cornwall Det Chief Insp Roy Linden, from the major crime investigation team, said: ""At this time there are several and significant common factors between the two addresses. ""In terms of the level of violence used we decided last night to link the investigations - originally they were treated as two separate murder investigations."" However, Supt Matt Lawler said officers were yet to establish a ""clear connection between the parties involved"". Flowers were left for the twins Dick and Roger Carter outside the property in Cowick Lane Dick and Roger Carter were born in September 1934, and were both directors of an agricultural company called Traycrop from the early 1990s until it was dissolved in 2004. ""You had a job to tell them apart they looked so similar, even at their age,"" said one neighbour who did not want to be named. Local shopkeeper Jim Wright, of Broadway Stores, said they were ""eccentric"" and ""reclusive"". ""Richard would come into the shop - I don't know the other one, he never came in."" Mr Wright's wife Kerry said: ""It's horrible to think something like that could happen outside your front door - your house is meant to be your safe place."" This video can not be played Three people who live close to the twin men in their 80s who were found dead give their reaction A police cordon was set up at the house, and a small collection of floral tributes could be seen outside. Windows of the large house were covered in what appeared to be whitewash and strips of tape. Supt Lawler said the force's local neighbourhood team would be visiting nearby residents over the next few days to provide ""advice, support, and to answer questions"". He also urged people to check on their elderly neighbours, adding it was an opportunity for the community to ""come together"". Police said both roads would be cordoned off for the rest of the day Forensic work is still being carried out at both properties Police have so far been unable to trace the family of the 80-year-old man. A neighbour said he was a ""very quiet man who kept himself to himself"". Shirley Sharpe said she did not know him personally, but he had lived in the house for ""a good few years"". The triple murder probe is being led by Devon and Cornwall Police's major crime investigation team Supt Lawler said he understood news of the deaths would ""cause significant and understandable concern and is an unprecedented event in our city which has shocked us all"". He added: ""I know that everyone's immediate thoughts will be with the family and friends of these gentlemen, and as you would expect, we are providing as much support as we can to them."" Both roads would remain cordoned off for the rest of the day, Devon and Cornwall Police said. The force has appealed for any potential witnesses from either area between 08:00 on Sunday and 13:00 on Tuesday to contact them. Police added it was ""important to avoid speculation"" during the ""complex case"".

"This video can not be played A study is being conducted by conservationists from Chester Zoo The secret life of the world's most trafficked mammal, the pangolin, has been caught on camera in Africa. Footage gives a rare insight into the behaviour of the giant pangolin, the largest of all the scaly animals. Observed by remote-operated cameras, a baby takes a ride on its mother's back, while an adult climbs a tree. Scientists are releasing the footage to highlight the plight of the animals, which are being pushed to extinction by illegal hunting for scales and meat. Large numbers of their scales have been seized this month alone, including Malaysia's biggest-ever interception of smuggled pangolin products. The images and video clips of giant pangolins, one of four species in Africa, were taken at Uganda's Ziwa sanctuary, where the animals live alongside protected rhinos and are safe from poaching. Stuart Nixon of Chester Zoo's Africa Field Programme said much of their behaviour has never been recorded before. ""We know so little about this species, almost everything we're picking up on camera traps this year as a behaviour is a new thing,"" he told BBC News. The giant pangolin: The largest of the eight species Sometimes called scaly anteaters, they are the only mammals in the world to be covered in protective scales Their scales are made of keratin, the same material found in human fingernails Pangolins lap up ants and termites with their long sticky tongues There are four species in Africa -the African white-bellied pangolin, giant ground pangolin, ground pangolin and black-bellied pangolin The giant pangolin, found in the rainforests and grasslands of equatorial Africa, is the biggest, measuring up to 1.8m long and weighing up to 75lbs. The pangolin is said to be the most widely trafficked mammal in the world. Its scales are in high demand in Asia for use in traditional Chinese medicine, despite there being no medical benefit for their use, while its meat is considered a delicacy in some countries. What's the secret to saving this rare creature? This week, authorities in Malaysia seized more than 27 tonnes of pangolins and their scales - believed to be worth at least Â£1.6m - on Borneo, in the biggest such haul in the country. They are regarded as a delicacy in some countries The wildlife monitoring group Traffic said police had discovered two big pangolin-processing facilities stocked with thousands of boxes of meat in the eastern state of Sabah. ""It is hoped that comprehensive investigations can lead to unmasking the syndicate and networks operating from the state and beyond,""  said Kanitha Krishnasamy, Traffic's director in Southeast Asia. The discovery comes just days after 10 tonnes of scales were intercepted in Vietnam, Hong Kong and Uganda. Scientists say the plight of the animals looks bleak, and they have no idea how many are left in the wild. Pangolin scales intercepted on Borneo Stuart Nixon, who is working in collaboration with the Uganda Wildlife Authority and the Rhino Fund Uganda on the project, said they are encountered so rarely in the wild that there is not enough data to allow a decent estimate. A study is under way to survey and monitor giant pangolins at the site as the first step towards identifying their strongholds. ""This species is literally being wiped out, it's being obliterated across central Africa, there's no doubt about that,"" he added. ""Trying to get people engaged and to care about pangolins is really the key step."" Sam Mwandha of the Uganda Wildlife Authority added: ""These rare glimpses into the lives of giant pangolins are very exciting for those of us dedicated to protecting Uganda's rich wildlife and challenges us to ensure that we protect and conserve this highly threatened species for future generations.""

"Ads like this should be more heavily restricted in future, say watchdogs Rules around gambling ads, which include a ban on the use of young celebrities and sports stars, will become stricter, especially online. From 1 April, gambling operators will also have to ensure that the majority of the audience of any social media influencers they work with are over 18. The Committees of Advertising Practice (CAP) said it was designed to protect children from irresponsible ads. A recent UK study suggested 450,000 11 to 16-year-olds regularly gamble. The new standards also ban the use of animated and licensed characters from film and television, as well as celebrities who ""appear to be"" under the age of 25. CAP says care must be taken that gambling ads do not appear in the children's section of websites - such as the young supporters' pages of a football club. The Advertising Standards Authority will enforce the rules, although it does not have the power to issue fines. The new standards follow a review conducted by CAP of the evidence of the impact of advertising on children, which was last carried out five years ago. The review included the results of previous complaints to the ASA on adverts deemed to be appealing to children. This included: Bookmaker Coral's ""Lucky Wizard"" game, which featured an animated wizard William Hill promotion which appeared within a Mario Kart app Gambling website featuring animated fairy story characters Hansel and Gretel and Red Riding Hood In all cases, the ASA ruled that the ads should not appear again as they were. Coral's ""lucky wizard"" had previously been ruled against by the Advertising Standards Authority. Dr Mark Griffiths, professor of behavioural addiction at Nottingham Trent University, said that overall the gambling industry is not keen to court young customers. ""The younger people start [gambling], the more likely they are to develop a problem - you want to be in a position where they are starting in their adult lives,"" he said. ""For most of the industry now, no one would say they want custom from people below the age of 18."" Andy Taylor, regulatory policy executive at CAP, told the BBC there were not a huge number of young stars featuring in gambling ads. ""The industry is well used to the fact that there is a cut-off point, they shouldn't be using individuals who maybe have that youth appeal, the professional footballer who's just burst onto the scene,"" he said. ""I think we don't see a massive amount of it, however where we do, we take action."" Mr Taylor added that the standards were specifically intended to enforce rules in the online space. ""What we want to see is the rules which have applied for a considerable period of time in traditional media, being applied in the online space effectively,"" he said. ""That means not targeting advertising at children and young people... and ensuring that the contents of those ads doesn't feature material that appeals particularly to them.""

"The Christmas Island detention centre operated from 2003-2018 Australian PM Scott Morrison says he will re-open a controversial detention centre on Christmas Island, after a historic defeat in parliament. On Tuesday,non-government MPs secured enough votes to pass a billmaking it easier for sick refugees held offshore to be treated in the country. Mr Morrison said the law would weaken the nation's tough border policies and embolden human traffickers. Opponents accused him of spreading fear before an impending election. Since 2013, Australia has sent asylum seekers arriving by boat to detention centres on Manus Island (Papua New Guinea) and Nauru. It previously also sent detainees to Christmas Island, an Australian territory in the Indian Ocean which is about 2,600km (1,600 miles) from the mainland and 300km south of Indonesia. The UN has criticised Australia's detention policies as ""inhumane"", but the nation insists they prevent human trafficking and save lives at sea. Last year, Australians were horrified by reports of a mental health crisis among children on Nauru - including cases of attempted suicide. The island where children have given up on life Refugee's emergency revives Australia row Total evacuation of Nauru refugees urged It prompted the Labor opposition, the Greens and crossbench MPs to support a bill that gives doctors the power to recommend that refugees be transferred to Australia for treatment. However,the immigration minister would still have some authority to overrule transfers. This video can not be played A local politician says re-opening the detention centre is political scaremongering. Mr Morrison fiercely opposed the bill but it was narrowly approved in the House of Representatives, where the government does not have a majority. It later cleared the Senate. On Wednesday, Mr Morrison said the government would re-open the Christmas Island centre ""to deal with the prospect of arrivals... and transfers"" - arguing both were now more likely. He added that Australia's border protection operations would receive other additional resources, but declined to elaborate. ""This parliament has already tipped its hand enough to the people smugglers,"" he said. Opponents pointed out that the bill applies only to people already on Nauru and Manus Island, meaning new arrivals would not be eligible for transfer to Australia.

"Venezuela's opposition leader Juan GuaidÃ³ addresses supporters at a rally in Caracas Venezuelan opposition leader Juan GuaidÃ³ has vowed at a rally in the capital Caracas to ensure humanitarian aid blocked by President NicolÃ¡s Maduro is brought in to the country. Mr GuaidÃ³ said new collection points and routes into the country would allow volunteers to bring the aid in. Mr Maduro told the BBC he would not allow aid in, claiming it was a means for the US to intervene in Venezuela. Venezuelans are facing drastic food shortages amid an economic crisis. ""We have almost 300,000 Venezuelans who will die if the aid doesn't enter. There are almost two million at health risk,"" said Mr GuaidÃ³ at the rally on Tuesday. Maduro speaks to the BBC: full transcript The Venezuela crisis in nine charts Aid lorries stuck in Colombia border city Mr GuaidÃ³, who has been recognised by the US and most Western governments as interim president of Venezuela, told his supporters in the capital that humanitarian aid would be brought into Venezuela on 23 February. Envoys for Mr GuaidÃ³ met with Brazilian officials this week and announced plans to create a second aid storage hub in the state of Roraima, on Venezuela's southeastern border. Mr GuaidÃ³ appeared to be relying on volunteers - he called on 250,000 people who signed up online to organise themselves over the weekend, ""because we're going to have to go in caravans"". US humanitarian aid trucks arrived last week at the Colombian border city of CÃºcuta but were stopped at the Tienditas bridge, which has been blocked by Venezuelan troops. Venezuela's military blocked the Tienditas Bridge to prevent US aid entering the country Mr Maduro still enjoys widespread support among the Venezuelan population and the loyalty of the military, and his leftist government is backed by Russia and China. But he is under growing national and international pressure to call early presidential elections, amid accusations of widespread corruption and human rights violations under his leadership. Please upgrade your browser to view this content. Mr GuaidÃ³ last week offered an amnesty to military personnel who break with Mr Maduro, telling them that refusing to allow in aid is a ""crime against humanity"". Speaking to the BBC's Orla Guerin, Mr Maduro called US President Donald Trump's government a ""gang of extremists"" and blamed America for his country's crisis. Mr Maduro said he did not see the need for early presidential elections, and reiterated that he would not allow US humanitarian aid into the country. ""They are warmongering in order to take over Venezuela,"" he said. This video can not be played Maduro: US 'warmongering' in order to take over Venezuela Relations between the US and Venezuela were already fraught before President Donald Trump's administration became one of the first to back Mr GuaidÃ³ as interim leader. Venezuela broke off diplomatic relations in response, while Mr Trump said the use of military force remained ""an option"". The US, which has accused Mr Maduro's government of human rights violations and corruption, has led international pressure on the Venezuelan president to step down. This video can not be played Why Venezuela matters to the US... and vice-versa The Trump administration has imposed a raft of economic measures on the country, including sanctions against the state-owned oil company PDVSA - Venezuela's main source of revenue. In recent years, the US has frozen Mr Maduro's US assets, restricted Venezuela's access to US markets and blocked dealings with those involved in the country's gold trade. Why US sanctions will hurt Why the military backs Maduro The men willing to die for Maduro's cause For years Venezuelans have faced severe shortages of basic items such as medicine and food. Last year, the inflation rate saw prices double every 19 days on average. Three million people, or 10% of the population, have left the country since the economy started to worsen in 2014, according to UN figures. Mr Maduro, who has been in power since 2013, was re-elected to a second term last year. But the elections were controversial, with many opposition candidates barred from running or jailed and claims of vote-rigging. The head of the opposition-controlled National Assembly, Mr GuaidÃ³ declared himself president on 23 January. He said the constitution allowed him to assume power temporarily when the president was deemed illegitimate.

"Ministers do not know the impact that funding cuts have had on police forces, the UK's public spending watchdog says. According to the National Audit Office,external, the Home Office does not know whether the police system in England and Wales is ""financially sustainable"". It calls the approach to police funding ""ineffective"" and ""detached"" from the changing demands faced by officers. A Home Office spokesman said the department had conducted a substantial review of police pressures last year. However, the Home Office had not even forecast the effect of losing 44,000 police officers and staff since 2010, the NAO said. Since September 2009 - the last set of Home Office figures before the Conservatives came into government - there has been a cut of 22,424 police officers. There were 126,252 police officers in England and Wales in September 2017, according to the latest figures. Historically there have been fewer officers - with 123,474 in 2001; 125,453 in 1991; and 116,544 in 1981, for example. Officer numbers grew during the Labour government from 2002 onwards, peaking in 2009. It took 18 days to charge an offence for the year ending March 2018 - four days longer than for the year ending March 2016 The arrest rate fell to 14 arrests per 1,000 population in 2016-17, down from 17 per 1,000 population in 2014-15 There have been fewer breathalyser tests, motoring fixed penalty notices and convictions for drugs trafficking and possession since 2010 33% of victims were not happy with police response in the year ending March 2018, up from 29% in the year ending March 2016 Met Police commissioner Cressida Dick told the annual conference of the Police Superintendents' Association that the force had faced ""unprecedented challenges"", noting that some officers are working ""longer and harder"". ""This is not a service that needs reform, this is a service that needs support and needs resources... the NAO report shows this,"" she said. Durham's chief constable Mike Barton said the decisions of Home Office ministers in regards to police funding were ""sometimes in the hands of the Treasury"". ""I actually think the cuts in 2010 were the wake up call that policing needed to say: 'Come on spend your money wisely',"" Mr Barton told BBC Breakfast. But he said there had been a ""constant strain"" since then with ""austerity dragging out"". Reality Check: What has happened to police numbers? What has happened to police funding? No-one charged 'in 9 out of 10 crimes' Mark Burns-Williamson, police and crime commissioner for West Yorkshire, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the report highlighted what other PCCs had been saying ""for some time"". Firstly, that the overall amount of funding for policing ""isn't enough"" - and secondly that the funding formula was ""not really fit for purpose"", leading to ""unfairness and differences"" between different areas. Home Affairs Select Committee chair Yvette Cooper said MPs had repeatedly heard about police forces being overstretched, calling the report ""very accurate"" and ""damning"". The Labour MP told the BBC it showed an ""irresponsible approach from the Home Office"" in making ""substantial cuts"" in the police budget ""without appearing to have any clear idea about what the impact of those cuts are"". The NAO report comes as Home Secretary Sajid Javid prepares for a speech to police superintendents in which he will say the police must be equipped for a changing landscape. On Monday, the leader of the superintendents' association warned the service wason the verge of a crisis. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Officers worked 97 hours' overtime in year 'Cash-strapped' police taking second jobs Number of special constables falling Police forces in England and Wales are funded through a Â£12.3bn combination of a central grant to each police and crime commissioner, as well as additional cash raised locally through the council tax and one-off grants for special projects. The NAO says the amount coming from the government is down 30% in real terms since 2010-11. You need a modern browser to view the interactive content in this page. The NAO's Tom McDonald said the Home Office ""does not really understand the nature of the demand"" facing police forces. He said the funding formula used to allocate money was ""out of date"", three years after the Home Office told Parliament that the formula was ineffective. ""It's unlikely that the money is going to the right places,"" he said. ""We have real concerns about it."" By Dominic Casciani, Home Affairs Correspondent This report from the national spending watchdog paints a picture of a service on the front line of public protection under severe pressure - but nobody in government being entirely sure how much pressure it is really under. The assessors said that while no force was about to financially fail, the stress was apparent. Since two years ago, officers are taking four days longer to charge suspects - an indication of workload rather than rising crime - and there is less ""proactive work"", such as motorway stops of dangerous drivers, breathalyser tests and convictions for drug possession. The rolling national crime survey has charted rising dissatisfaction with the police - and many communities have campaigned against losing local cuts. Two cities - St Albans and Bath - no longer have a dedicated police station with a front desk. A Home Office plan to revise the police funding formula, to more fairly distribute funds, was mothballed following the June 2017 general election. The NAO said individual forces had been developing their own ways of predicting demand for their services but the Home Office itself had ""no overarching strategy for policing"". But a Home Office spokesman disputed some of the NAO's findings - saying it had ""a strategic direction"" and last year conducted a substantial review of police pressures. ""Our decision to empower locally accountable police and crime commissioners to make decisions using their local expertise does not mean that we do not understand the demands on police forces,"" said the spokesman. ""The report does not recognise the strengths of PCCs and chief constables leading on day-to-day policing matters, including on financial sustainability. ""We remain committed to working closely with police and delivered a Â£460m increase in overall police funding in 2018/19, including increased funding for local policing through council tax,"" the spokesman said.

"This video can not be played El Chapo trial: Five facts about Mexican drug lord JoaquÃ­n GuzmÃ¡n Mexican drug kingpin JoaquÃ­n ""El Chapo"" GuzmÃ¡n has been found guilty on all 10 counts at his drug-trafficking trial at a federal court in New York. GuzmÃ¡n, 61, was convicted on numerous counts including the distribution of cocaine and heroin, illegal firearms possession and money laundering. He has yet to be sentenced, but the verdict could mean life in jail. GuzmÃ¡n was arrested in January 2016 after escaping from a Mexican prison through a tunnel five months earlier. He was extradited to the US in 2017. Who is 'El Chapo' GuzmÃ¡n? Mexico's most-wanted: A guide to the drug cartels Shocking allegations in 'El Chapo' trial The Mexican was accused of being behind the all-powerful Sinaloa drug cartel, which prosecutors say was the biggest supplier of drugs to the US. Tuesday's unanimous verdict by a jury in Brooklyn, which was read out in a packed courtroom, followed an 11-week trial. GuzmÃ¡n, wearing a dark suit jacket and tie, showed no visible sign of emotion as the verdict was announced, CBS News reported. This video can not be played The US attorney for the Eastern District of New York and El Chapo's lawyer gave their reactions outside court As he was escorted from the courtroom, GuzmÃ¡n shook the hands of his lawyers before exchanging glances with his wife, Emma Coronel, a 29-year-old former beauty queen, and giving her the thumbs up. Judge Brian Cogan, who presided over the trial, thanked the jurors for their dedication at what he described as a complex trial, saying it was ""remarkable and it made me very proud to be an American"". GuzmÃ¡n's lawyers said they planned to launch an appeal. ""El Chapo"" (or ""Shorty"") ran the Sinaloa cartel in northern Mexico. This video can not be played Mexico's drug war: Has it turned the tide? Over time, it became one of the biggest traffickers of drugs to the US. In 2009, GuzmÃ¡n entered Forbes' list of the world's richest men at number 701, with an estimated worth of $1bn (Â£775m). He was accused of having helped export hundreds of tonnes of cocaine into the US and of conspiring to manufacture and distribute heroin, methamphetamine and marijuana. He was also said to have used hitmen to carry out ""hundreds"" of murders, assaults, kidnappings and acts of torture on rivals. Key associates, including one former lieutenant, testified against GuzmÃ¡n. It provided shocking revelations about the Mexican drug lord's life. Court papers accused him of having girls as young as 13 drugged before raping them. GuzmÃ¡n ""called the youngest of the girls his 'vitamins' because he believed that sexual activity with young girls gave him 'life'"", a former associate, Colombian drug trafficker Alex Cifuentes, was quoted as saying. During the trial Cifuentes also alleged that GuzmÃ¡n gave a $100m (Â£77m) bribe to former Mexican President Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto, who is said to have contacted him after taking office in 2012 and asked for $250m in return for ending a manhunt for him. Mr PeÃ±a Nieto has not publicly commented. Former associate Cifuentes (L) alleged that GuzmÃ¡n (R) bribed Mexico's then president Another witness described seeing GuzmÃ¡n murder at least three men. Former bodyguard Isaias Valdez Rios said GuzmÃ¡n beat two people who had joined a rival cartel until they were ""completely like rag dolls"". He then shot them in the head and ordered their bodies be thrown on a fire. In another incident, he had a member of the rival Arellano Felix cartel burned and imprisoned before taking him to a graveyard, shooting him and having him buried alive. GuzmÃ¡n is also alleged to have had his own cousin killed for lying about being out of town, and ordered a hit on the brother of another cartel leader because he did not shake his hand. When asked by a former cartel lieutenant why he killed people, he is alleged to have said: ""Either your mom's going to cry or their mom's going to cry."" GuzmÃ¡n's wife Emma Coronel attended the trial The court heard details of his 2015 escape from Mexico's maximum-security Altiplano prison. His sons bought a property near the prison and a GPS watch smuggled into the prison gave diggers his exact location. At one point GuzmÃ¡n complained that he could hear the digging from his cell. He escaped by riding a specially adapted small motorcycle through the tunnel. He also used software on his phone to spy on his wife and mistresses, which allowed the FBI to present his text messages in court. In one set of texts, he recounted to his wife how he had fled a villa during a raid by US and Mexican officials, before asking her to bring him new clothes, shoes and black moustache dye. GuzmÃ¡n is the highest profile Mexican drug cartel boss so far to stand trial in the US. The drug war in Mexico - pitting the Mexican and US authorities against cartels smuggling drugs into the US and the cartels against each other - has killed about 100,000 people over more than a decade. This video can not be played A former DEA agent describes capturing GuzmÃ¡n in 2014 - he later escaped GuzmÃ¡n achieved notoriety for twice escaping custody in Mexico as well as avoiding arrest on numerous other occasions. Among some in his home state,he had the status of a folk hero, a popular subject of ""narcocorridos"" - musical tributes to drugs barons. In 2016, he gave an interview to Hollywood actor Sean Penn in a Mexican jungle following his escape the previous year and boasted that he was the world's leading supplier of heroin, methamphetamine, cocaine and marijuana. He was later recaptured in the north-western town of Los Mochis. During the raid he fled through a drain but was later caught by troops in a shootout. New York's Brooklyn Bridge was closed each time the motorcade containing GuzmÃ¡n drove across it The US indictment against him was a consolidation of charges from six federal jurisdictions across the country, including New York, Chicago and Miami. Prosecutors pooled together evidence acquired over more than a decade, including from international partners such as Mexico and Colombia, to build their sweeping case. The trial jurors were anonymous and were escorted to and from the courthouse in Brooklyn by armed marshals after prosecutors argued that GuzmÃ¡n had a history of intimidating witnesses and even ordering their murders.

"Theresa May has played down reports that she could force MPs to choose between backing her deal or accepting a delay to EU withdrawal. ITV News said,externalchief UK negotiator Olly Robbins was overheard in a Brussels bar saying the EU was likely to allow an extension to the Brexit process. The PM suggested MPs should not rely on ""what someone said to someone else as overheard by someone else, in a bar"". ""It is very clear the government's position is the same,"" she said. ""We triggered Article 50 (the process by which the UK leaves the EU)... that had a two-year time limit, that ends on the 29 March. ""We want to leave with a deal, and that's what we are working for."" Prime Minister's Questions: The verdict No-deal Brexit plan for Channel Tunnel Kuenssberg: Will May delay vote to last minute? Commons Live: MPs discuss trade deals The prime minister has said she will lift the requirement for a 21-day period before any vote to approve an international treaty, which means she could delay the final Brexit vote until days before the UK is due to leave the EU. No 10 insists Mrs May still plans to hold a vote on a deal as soon as possible but Labour has accused her of ""running down the clock"" in an effort to ""blackmail"" MPs into backing her deal.

At Prime Minister's Questions, the SNP's Westminster Leader Ian Blackford urged Mrs May to rule out holding a ""meaningful vote"" on the deal with less than two weeks to go until Brexit. ""The prime minister must stop playing fast and loose - businesses are begging for certainty,"" he said. Mrs May said the way to give businesses certainty was to back the deal she had negotiated with the EU. But Mr Blackford told her she had been ""rumbled by your own loose-lipped senior Brexit adviser"". It was a reference to the ITV report that Mr Robbins was overheard saying he expected MPs to be presented with a choice of backing either a reworked withdrawal deal, or a potentially significant delay to Brexit. MPs rejected the deal negotiated with the EU by a historic margin in January and the prime minister says she is seeking legally-binding changes to the controversial ""backstop"" - the ""insurance policy"" aimed at avoiding a return to border checks between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer says MPs would force the PM to delay Brexit, rather than accept a no-deal scenario The UK is currently due to leave the EU on 29 March, whether or not a deal has been approved by the Commons. On Wednesday, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn pointed to thedecision to scrap a no-deal Brexit contract with a ferry company that had no shipsas a ""spectacular failure"" which was ""a symptom of the utter shambles of this government and its no-deal preparations"". He described the prime minister's Brexit strategy as ""costly, shambolic and deliberately evasive"". Mrs May accused Mr Corbyn of preferring ""ambiguity and playing politics to acting in the national interest"" saying MPs did not know if he backed another referendum, a deal or Brexit. ""People used to say he was a conviction politician - not any more,"" she said. The PM has promised to return to the Commons on 26 February with a further statement - triggering another debate and votes the following day - if a deal has not been secured by that date. If a deal is agreed, MPs will have a second ""meaningful vote"", more than a month after Mrs May's deal was rejected in the first one. No 10 has indicated it is willing to make concessions on protection for workers but Labour's push for a closer future customs relationship than Mrs May proposes, remains a sticking point. Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer met Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington and Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay on Wednesday for what he described as ""frank and serious discussions"". But he said he was given ""no suggestion"" that the prime minister was ""diluting red lines"". He added that he had ""set out the Labour Party position, which is the two options: On one hand a close economic relationship, on the other a public vote"". He said the battle for now is ""to stop the prime minister running down the clock"". Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell has acknowledged that the prime minister cannot back Labour's Brexit proposals, and said he thinks Parliament is going to end up taking over the Brexit process. Asked at a Politico event on Wednesday how Labour was going to achieve its plans, including staying in a customs union, because, ""you know she can't back it... she'll split her party"", Mr Donnell replied: ""Yeah... yeah"". ""I genuinely think we're now into hard-nosed negotiations between pockets of support in all the different politics,"" he said. He accepted that the general election Labour has been calling for was ""unlikely"". Labour has tabled an amendment for Thursday that would force the government to come back to Parliament by the end of the month to hold a substantive vote in the Commons on its plan for Brexit. ""Our amendment says there should be a hard stop on February 26. The prime minister must either put up her deal or allow Parliament to take control,"" said Sir Keir. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Mrs May told MPs on Tuesday she was discussing a number of options with the EU to secure legally-binding changes to the backstop, including replacing it with ""alternative arrangements"", putting a time limit on how long it can stay in place, or a unilateral exit clause so the UK can leave it at a time of its choosing. MPs are due to vote again on the Brexit process on Thursday in what was expected to be a routine procedure acknowledging the government's efforts. Please upgrade your browser However, BBC political editor Laura Kuenssbergtweeted,externalthat Mrs May could be faced with another defeat, with influential Brexiteers from the European Research Group of Tory backbenchers indicating that they will refuse to back the government. They are angry at being asked to support the PM's motion, which combines the view backed by a majority of MPs last month that the government should seek an alternative to the backstop with a separate move to stop Brexit happening without a formal deal. How MPs aim to alter Brexit process Brexit: What could happen next? Brexit: A really simple guide The group's deputy chairman, Mark Francois, told the BBC members had ""pleaded"" with Downing Street to change the wording, which he said goes back on what she has previously told MPs. ""We cannot vote for this as it is currently configured because it rules out no deal and removes our negotiating leverage in Brussels."" Most MPs want to avoid a no-deal scenario, fearing chaos at ports and disruption to business. However, some Brexiteers have played down that prospect arguing it is an example of ""Project Fear"". Meanwhile, Labour have highlighted a government risk assessment that says ""precisely four"" of about 40 documents designed to replicate the existing 40 EU free trade agreements have been signed. The party's trade spokesman Barry Gardiner said of the agreements, which were promised to be ready immediately after Brexit: ""Nine are off-track, 19 significantly off-track, four are not possible to be completed by March 2019 and two are not even being negotiated."" International Trade Secretary Liam Fox responded: ""A number of negotiations are at an advanced stage.

"Daniel's mum, Ann, says extra support is key to academic success for deaf pupils Deaf children in England are falling behind their classmates from primary school through to GCSE, analysis by the National Deaf Children's Society shows. Only 30.6% achieve a GCSE strong pass - Grade 5 or above - in both English and maths, compared with 48.3% of children with no special educational needs. And 57% fail to reach expected levels in reading, writing and maths in Sats tests at the end of primary, compared with 26% of children with no SEN. The NCDS urges more government funding. Its analysis of government data suggests the averageAttainment 8,externalscore (how well pupils do across eight core subjects) for deaf children was 39.2 - but for those with no SEN, the average was 49.8. Ann Jillings, from Lowestoft, in Suffolk, says the only reason her 12-year-old deaf son, Daniel, is not falling behind at school is because the family has fought hard for additional support. ""Sometimes I've been quite dogged in making sure that Daniel's [education, health and care] plan reflected what he needed - it takes a certain amount of stubbornness and perseverance to navigate the system,"" she says. ""I can see my child is very able - he wants to go to university - and I've vowed there's no way I'm going to let him be let down by the system. ""But I do fear for about what happens to the children whose parents aren't as well informed or who don't have the ability to fight so hard for their children."" Ann says making sure Daniel doesn't slip behind his classmates at his mainstream school is a constant worry. ""We can never take our eye off the ball,"" she says. ""Even though something's in the education plan, we always have to make sure it's being delivered. ""Why should there be a ceiling on their potential just because they're deaf? ""Deaf children have the same potential as their peers and it's a crying shame if they don't achieve that - it's their long-term employment, it's not just now, it's their whole lifetime."" Chief executive of the NDCS, Susan Daniels, said: ""These figures show the true depth of the crisis engulfing deaf education in this country. ""Meanwhile, the government is starving local councils of funding, meaning their support is cut back and their specialist teachers are being laid off. ""The government needs to address the gap in results urgently and begin to adequately fund the support deaf children need. ""It promised every child in this country a world class education, but until deaf and hearing children progress and achieve at the same level, it is failing to deliver and that is utterly unacceptable."" A spokeswoman for the Department for Education said: ""Our ambition for children with special educational needs and disabilities, including those who are deaf, is exactly the same for every other child - to achieve well in education, and go on to live happy and fulfilled lives. ""We recognise that local authorities are facing cost pressures on high needs and that there is more to do which is why in December 2018 we announced an additional Â£250m in funding for high needs over this and next year.""

"Venezuela's opposition leader Juan GuaidÃ³ addresses supporters at a rally in Caracas Venezuelan opposition leader Juan GuaidÃ³ has vowed at a rally in the capital Caracas to ensure humanitarian aid blocked by President NicolÃ¡s Maduro is brought in to the country. Mr GuaidÃ³ said new collection points and routes into the country would allow volunteers to bring the aid in. Mr Maduro told the BBC he would not allow aid in, claiming it was a means for the US to intervene in Venezuela. Venezuelans are facing drastic food shortages amid an economic crisis. ""We have almost 300,000 Venezuelans who will die if the aid doesn't enter. There are almost two million at health risk,"" said Mr GuaidÃ³ at the rally on Tuesday. Maduro speaks to the BBC: full transcript The Venezuela crisis in nine charts Aid lorries stuck in Colombia border city Mr GuaidÃ³, who has been recognised by the US and most Western governments as interim president of Venezuela, told his supporters in the capital that humanitarian aid would be brought into Venezuela on 23 February. Envoys for Mr GuaidÃ³ met with Brazilian officials this week and announced plans to create a second aid storage hub in the state of Roraima, on Venezuela's southeastern border. Mr GuaidÃ³ appeared to be relying on volunteers - he called on 250,000 people who signed up online to organise themselves over the weekend, ""because we're going to have to go in caravans"". US humanitarian aid trucks arrived last week at the Colombian border city of CÃºcuta but were stopped at the Tienditas bridge, which has been blocked by Venezuelan troops. Venezuela's military blocked the Tienditas Bridge to prevent US aid entering the country Mr Maduro still enjoys widespread support among the Venezuelan population and the loyalty of the military, and his leftist government is backed by Russia and China. But he is under growing national and international pressure to call early presidential elections, amid accusations of widespread corruption and human rights violations under his leadership. Please upgrade your browser to view this content. Mr GuaidÃ³ last week offered an amnesty to military personnel who break with Mr Maduro, telling them that refusing to allow in aid is a ""crime against humanity"". Speaking to the BBC's Orla Guerin, Mr Maduro called US President Donald Trump's government a ""gang of extremists"" and blamed America for his country's crisis. Mr Maduro said he did not see the need for early presidential elections, and reiterated that he would not allow US humanitarian aid into the country. ""They are warmongering in order to take over Venezuela,"" he said. This video can not be played Maduro: US 'warmongering' in order to take over Venezuela Relations between the US and Venezuela were already fraught before President Donald Trump's administration became one of the first to back Mr GuaidÃ³ as interim leader. Venezuela broke off diplomatic relations in response, while Mr Trump said the use of military force remained ""an option"". The US, which has accused Mr Maduro's government of human rights violations and corruption, has led international pressure on the Venezuelan president to step down. This video can not be played Why Venezuela matters to the US... and vice-versa The Trump administration has imposed a raft of economic measures on the country, including sanctions against the state-owned oil company PDVSA - Venezuela's main source of revenue. In recent years, the US has frozen Mr Maduro's US assets, restricted Venezuela's access to US markets and blocked dealings with those involved in the country's gold trade. Why US sanctions will hurt Why the military backs Maduro The men willing to die for Maduro's cause For years Venezuelans have faced severe shortages of basic items such as medicine and food. Last year, the inflation rate saw prices double every 19 days on average. Three million people, or 10% of the population, have left the country since the economy started to worsen in 2014, according to UN figures. Mr Maduro, who has been in power since 2013, was re-elected to a second term last year. But the elections were controversial, with many opposition candidates barred from running or jailed and claims of vote-rigging. The head of the opposition-controlled National Assembly, Mr GuaidÃ³ declared himself president on 23 January. He said the constitution allowed him to assume power temporarily when the president was deemed illegitimate.

"The trial of accused druglord Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman is nearing its end after eight weeks of evidence from the prosecution The trial of JoaquÃ­n ""El Chapo"" GuzmÃ¡n has provided shocking revelations about the Mexican drug lord's life. Below are some of the most disturbing testimonies by witnesses in the high-profile trial in New York as well as some allegations which are plain bizarre. A trusted hitman for El Chapo kept a ""murder room"" in his mansion on the US border, which featured a drain on the floor to more easily clean up after slayings. Edgar Galvan testified in January that Antonio ""Jaguar"" Marrufo had a room with white tiles that was sound-proofed ""so no noise comes out"". ""In that house, no-one comes out,"" Galvan told jurors. Galvan said his role in the organisation was to smuggle weapons into the US, so that Marrufo could use them to ""clear"" the region of rivals. At the time, he was living in El Paso, Texas, while Marrufo was living in Ciudad Juarez, just across the US-Mexico border. But both men are now in jail on firearms and gun charges. Documents unsealed just two days before jury deliberations offered disturbing new accusations against El Chapo from Alex Cifuentes, a Colombian drug lord who has described himself as El Chapo's ""right-hand man"". Cifuentes, who prosecutors say spent two years hiding from authorities with El Chapo in the Mexican mountains, claims that El Chapo would drug and rape girls as young as 13 years old,according to the New York Times,external. A woman named Comadre Maria would routinely send El Chapo photographs of young girls that he and his associates could pick from. This same woman was involved as an intermediary for El Chapo's dealings with Mexico's president, Cifuentes alleged during the trial. For $5,000 (Â£3,800), Cifuentes claims Comadre Maria would send the selected girls up to Mr Guzman's mountain camps, where they would be drugged with ""a powdery substance"" and raped. The documents allege that El Chapo called the youngest girls ""his vitamins"" and said raping them gave him ""life"". Mr Guzman's lawyer said his client denies these allegations and added that the claims had been ""too prejudicial and unreliable to be admitted at trial"". El Chapo's wife, Emma Coronel, sat quietly through a session where the FBI shared her husband's texts to his lovers A bombshell allegation came during Cifunetes' in-court testimony. Cifuentes claims former Mexican President Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto, who served from 2012-18, accepted a $100m (Â£77m) bribe from El Chapo. He alleges Mr Pena Nieto contacted El Chapo after taking office in 2012, asking for $250m in return for ending a manhunt for the drug cartel kingpin. El Chapo instead offered him $100m, which the new president allegedly accepted. Mr Pena Nieto has not publicly commented on the allegations. ""El Chapo"" used his slew of mistresses to help further his narcotics operation - and his text history proves it, the FBI alleges. Thanks to the Flexi-spy software GuzmÃ¡n used to spy on his wife, Emma Coronel, and the women with whom he had affairs, the FBI was able to present his texts in court. GuzmÃ¡n and Ms Coronel fawned over their daughters in many texts, as parents do, but some had a distinctly ""El Chapo"" sensibility. In one sent on the twins' six-month birthday,the New York Daily News reported,external, he said: ""Our [daughter] is fearless, I'm going to give her an AK-47 so she can hang with me."" Another damaging series of texts relayed how El Chapo fled a villa during a raid by US and Mexican officials. ""I had to run out at three in the afternoon,"" GuzmÃ¡n told his wife. ""I saw them pounding on the door next door, but I was able to jump out."" The life of 'El Chapo' Who is 'El Chapo' GuzmÃ¡n? He then reportedly asked her to bring him new clothes, shoes and black moustache dye. GuzmÃ¡n tracked around 50 people through phones and computers, according to the drug lord's ex-techie, Cristian Rodriguez. Mr Rodriguez told the court ""El Chapo"" frequently turned on his lovers' microphones after ending calls with them ""to see what they would say about him"", the Daily News reported. One of those lovers was Agustina Cabanillas Acosta, who allegedly helped ""El Chapo"" make deals across the region. In between sweet nothings, they discussed drug shipments and ""non-stop"" sales. The alleged kingpin also reportedly paid for Ms Acosta's liposuction. Ms Acosta, meanwhile, was well aware of her lover's snooping -""I'm way smarter than him,"" she reportedly texted her friends,external. Lucero Guadalupe Sanchez Lopez, girlfriend (2nd left) of accused Mexican drug lord Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman (2nd right), testifies as his wife Emma Coronel (right) looks on In the most gruesome testimony to date, witness Isaias Valdez Rios described seeing ""El Chapo"" brutally beat at least three men before shooting them. In one incident, Mr Valdez Rios said two people originally from Sinaloa who had joined the rival Los Zetas cartel were deemed traitors and rounded up by GuzmÃ¡n's hitmen. For more than three hours the drug lord brutally beat them, GuzmÃ¡n's former bodyguard said. ""They were completely like rag dolls - their bones were totally broken. They could not move. And Joaquin was still hitting them with the branch and his weapon too,"" Mr Valdez Rios said. The two men were later driven to an area where they could see a large bonfire. There, the jury was told, ""El Chapo"" cursed each one before shooting them in the head with his rifle. The leader of the Sinaloa cartel ordered that they be thrown in the bonfire, telling his men that he did not want any bones to remain, Mr Valdez Rios said. He said the third man murdered by ""El Chapo"" was a member of the rival Arellano Felix cartel. ""He had burns made with an iron on his back, his shirt was stuck to his skin. He had burns made with a car lighter all over his body. His feet were burned,"" Mr Valdez Rios told the court. The man was then locked in a wooden structure for days. Then he was brought blindfolded to a graveyard, his hands and legs bound. ""El Chapo"" started to interrogate him, and while he was responding, shot him with his handgun. The man was still gasping for air - but he was dumped in a hole and buried alive, Mr Valdez Rios said. The secrets of the drug lord's daring escape from a Mexican maximum security prison in 2015 were revealed by a former cartel associate. Testifying in court, Damaso Lopez said his boss' wife and sons had been involved from the start to get El Chapo out of Altiplano prison. He mentioned secret meetings in 2014, where Emma Coronel delivered detailed instructions from her husband to the plotters. ""A tunnel had to be built and they [plotters] should start to work,"" Ms Coronel said. ""El Chapo"" used a specially adapted motorcycle to ride through the tunnel The kingpin's sons later bought a property near the prison, and the digging started. A GPS watch was smuggled into the prison, giving the plotters exact co-ordinates where the drug lord's prison cell was. The one-mile (1.6km) tunnel took months to complete, and ""El Chapo"" had complained that digging was too loud and he could hear the ""noise"" from his cell, Mr Lopez said. He added that the concrete below his boss' cell ""had been very difficult to break through"". Despite all the problems, ""El Chapo"" escaped in July 2015, riding on a specially adapted small motorcycle through the tunnel. Yet another mistress, Lucero Guadalupe Sanchez Lopez, revealed to the court details of the drug lord's 2014 escape from Mexican marines. When the marines burst into his safehouse, Ms Lopez said the alleged drug lord took off running - stark naked. They used an escape tunnel under a bathtub to flee, trudging through mud for an hour before surfacing,according to the New York Post,external. As the mistress began to cry while testifying, the drug lord's wife, Ms Coronel, reportedly cackled in the gallery. Just days after his affair with Ms Lopez, ""El Chapo"" would be captured by authorities - once again naked - in bed with Ms Coronel. She and her husband were both in matching burgundy-coloured jackets during Ms Lopez's testimony, in an attempt to show their solidarity, reports the BBC's Tara McKelvey from court. The drug lord's reputed extravagance extended even to his extensive collection of weaponry, the trial has heard. Among his prized possessions were a diamond-encrusted, monogrammed pistol and a gold-plated AK-47. A diamond-encrusted pistol that allegedly belonged to Mr GuzmÃ¡n Much of the evidence against the suspected narco chief has come from the prosecution's star witness, JesÃºs Zambada. Mr Zambada testified that the alleged drug kingpin had the brother of another cartel leader killed because he did not shake GuzmÃ¡n's hand. Rodolfo Fuentes had met GuzmÃ¡n to make peace in a cartel and gang war, the court heard. ""When [Rodolfo] left, Chapo gave him his hand and said, 'See you later, friend,' and Rodolfo just left him standing there with his hand extended,"" Mr Zambada said. Mr Fuentes and his wife were shot and killed outside a cinema soon afterwards. Mexico president rejects 'El Chapo' claims 'El Chapo' fan rejected from his jury Former Sinaloa lieutenant Miguel Angel Martinez also testified for the government, telling the jury he once asked ""El Chapo"" why he killed people. ""And he answered me: 'Either your mom's going to cry or their mom's going to cry.'"" A former cartel leader told the court how ""El Chapo"" oncehad his own cousin killed,externalafter the man lied about being out of town. Juan Guzman had told the drug boss he would be travelling, only to be spotted at a park in the city. ""My compadre became angry, because he had lied to him,"" ex-cartel capo Damaso Lopez Nunez said. To make an example out of Juan, ""El Chapo"" allegedly ordered him to be interrogated and assassinated. Juan's secretary, who was with him at the time, was also killed. The drug boss' mistress Ms Lopez later told the court she remembered being with him when the news of Juan's death arrived. ""He said from that point on, whoever betrayed him, they would die,"" Ms Lopez said.  ""Whether they were family or women, they were going to die."" Assistant US Attorney Adam Fels said in his opening argument that ""El Chapo"" had sent ""more than a line of cocaine for every single person in the United States"" - in just four of his shipments. That amounts to over 328 million lines of cocaine, said the prosecutor. Mr Zambada said that once, in 1994, GuzmÃ¡n gave the order to sink a boat carrying 20 tonnes of cocaine to evade authorities. Drug kingpin Joaquin ""El Chapo"" GuzmÃ¡n is escorted into a helicopter at Mexico City""s airport following his recapture during an intense military operation in Los Mochis, in Sinaloa State The court also heard that GuzmÃ¡n once used a bazooka for target practice - to relax on a family holiday. Mr Zambada said ""El Chapo"" took the anti-tank rocket launcher with him on a trip with relatives in 2005. Hedecided to ""test out"" the weapon,externalafter the group had finished target practice with assault rifles, according to the witness. Some of the biggest news from testimony was how the Sinaloa cartel allegedly paid off a host of top Mexican officials to ensure their drug business ran smoothly. Mr Zambada said the traffickers had $50m (Â£39m) in protection money for former Mexican Secretary of Public Security GarcÃ­a Luna, so that corrupt officers would be appointed to head police operations. Mr Zambada said he gave the money to Mr Luna in briefcases full of cash. Mr Luna has denied the allegations. When former Mexico City Mayor Gabriel Regino was in line to become the next secretary of security, Mr Zambada says the cartel bribed him, too. Mr Regino, who is now a professor, has also denied the claims. ""El Chapo"" (right) is the highest-ranking alleged drug lord to face trial in the US so far A 6in (15cm) figurine of a folk hero dubbed the narco-saint has been spotted on a shelf in a conference room used by the defendant's lawyers at the court,the New York Post reported,external. The statue of JesÃºs Malverde,external, which has him seated on a purple throne with bags of cash, appeared on Wednesday, one of GuzmÃ¡n's lawyers told the newspaper. JesÃºs Malverde has been celebrated as a Robin Hood-type hero who, legend says, stole from the rich and gave to the poor in the early 1900s. Mr Martinez told the court GuzmÃ¡n was so wealthy, he had a private zoo on top of his numerous properties - including a $10m (Â£8) beach house as well as a yacht he named after himself (""Chapito""). Built in the early '90s, El Chapo's zoo reportedly had lions, tigers, and crocodiles, as well as a little train to ferry guests through it. The property also had a house, pool and tennis courts nearby, Mr Martinez said.
