"Scott Benton sits on the parliamentary groups on betting and eating disorders A Tory MP who co-chairs a parliamentary group on eating disorders has been accused of ""fat-shaming"" a councillor who criticised him on Twitter. Blackpool Labour's David Colldash tweeted on Thursday that local MP Scott Benton accepting football tickets from a betting firm was like him accepting a free pasty. The MP replied that Mr Colldash seemed to have had ""more than one free pasty"". The councillor, who also works as a nurse, said the reply was ""nasty"". Mr Benton has been approached for comment.

"Travellers and tourism groups have criticised the ongoing need for people coming to England, Scotland and Wales from France to quarantine for 10 days. Quarantine rules are due to end for fully vaccinated people arriving from otheramber list countries,externalon Monday. France remains on the amber list, but there is concern over the level of Beta variant in the country as it may evade vaccine protection. An industry group said the decision ""squashed"" consumer confidence. Gemma Antrobus, from the Association of Independent Tour Operators, estimated that hundreds of thousands of travellers would be affected by the change. She told the BBC the industry was in shock and the decision ""proves that something can come out of nowhere at the very last minute"". The UK governmentannounced the change of policy on Friday evening. Each UK nation sets its own travel rules. Wales said it would be following the change set by England, and on Saturday evening Scotland announced it was doing the same. Northern Ireland is yet to announce its intention. The Beta variant - first identified in South Africa - accounts for about 10% of new infections in France. But that includes the Indian Ocean territories of Reunion and Mayotte, where the variant is near-universal. The more infectious Delta variant - first identified in India - accounts for almost all new cases in the UK. How are summer holiday rules changing on Monday? How can I prove I'm fully vaccinated? How dangerous are new variants? Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the government had always been clear that it would take ""rapid action"" to stop the spread of Covid. But Willie Walsh, the director-general of the International Air Transport Association, said the UK is ""destroying its own travel sector and the thousands of jobs that rely on it"" through constantly changing its travel rules. And Easyjet chief Johan Lundgren said the decision ""pulls the rug"" from travellers already in France and shows the traffic light system for pandemic travel is ""falling apart"". Travellers told the BBC they were frustrated by the inconsistent rules, while some said it was making it hard to visit family members abroad. This video can not be played James Miles says his plans to visit his partner in France have been thrown into doubt James Miles from West Sussex said the quarantine requirement had put his plan to visit his girlfriend for the first time since 1 January in jeopardy. ""This is really affecting people's lives,"" he said. ""Seven months is a long time not to see your partner. I can't even see the light at the end of the tunnel. Where do we go from here?"" Georgina Thomas, a nurse from Buckinghamshire who has been visiting her parents, told the PA news agency: ""I'm frustrated with the inconsistent approach the government are taking, it doesn't all appear logical. ""If a quarantine is necessary then so be it, but I'm confident that my risk will be higher when I return to the UK."" The government announcement means that anyone who has been in France in the previous 10 days will need to quarantine on arrival to England in their own accommodation and will need a day two and day eight test, regardless of their vaccination status. This includes any fully vaccinated individual who transits through France from either a green or another amber country. But ministers indicated that Eurostar passengers on services travelling through France would not need to quarantine if their train did not stop in the country. Existing amber list exemptions for key workers such as hauliers will remain in place. French MEP Veronique Trillet-Lenoir told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that it was ""difficult to understand"" the UK rules, as the Beta variant is ""not present at all"" in mainland France, with France's cases mainly being found in its overseas territories. There has been no official response from the French government yet, but BBC Paris correspondent Hugh Schofield said it would be pushing for an explanation from its London counterpart for the toughened policy. France has announced it will tighten its rules for UK travellers who are not fully vaccinated, requiring a negative test in the 24 hours before arrival from Sunday, rather than the 48 hours allowed previously. Anyone fully vaccinated with a jab from Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, AstraZeneca or Johnson & Johnson from any country will be exempt from providing a negative test, however. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? LOCKDOWN RULES:What are they and when will they end? VACCINE:When will I get the jab? Prof John Edmunds, an epidemiologist from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and a government adviser on the Sage committee, said the Beta variant was at low levels in the UK but, as immunity from vaccines increases, ""conditions are right"" for it to gain an advantage. He told the Today programme that the Beta variant is probably less infectious than the dominant Delta variant, but it appears to be better able to evade the immune response from vaccines - particularly from the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. The UK is currently facing a ""long and drawn out"" wave of infections from the Delta variant, he said, as it will not be brought down by lockdowns as previous peaks were. He said cases are on course to hit 100,000 a day in about two weeks, although school closures over the summer may help to bring down the surge or cause it to level off. But high levels of infection were likely throughout the rest of the summer and autumn, he said. In other developments: Chairman of the Commons health select committee Jeremy Hunt warned that Covid restrictions may have to be reintroduced if cases are still rising when schools return in September. He also said the ""warning light on the NHS dashboard... is flashing red"" with hospital admissions expected to rise to 10,000 by the end of August The Trades Union Congress has called on the government to ""fix sick pay"" amid rising numbers of people being asked to self-isolate. Deputy general secretary Paul Nowak said many people cannot afford the time off work Bulgaria has announced a ban on UK travellers entering the country amid rising cases How are travel rules being relaxed?

"With social distancing restrictions ending in England and easing further in Scotland on 19 July, good ventilation will remain very important in avoiding Covid. For months we've been told to wash our hands and maintain social distancing to beat the virus. But scientists and engineers say we also need to think about the air we breathe inside buildings. Good ventilation matters in five ways. When you walk into a room and the air feels stale, something is wrong with the ventilation. Not enough fresh air is being introduced, which increases your chances of getting infected by coronavirus. Recent research shows that in confined spaces there can be ""airborne transmission"" of the virus - with tiny virus particles lingering in the air. According toworkplace regulations set up before the pandemic,external, everyone should get 10 litres of fresh air every second, and that matters more than ever now. So if a place seems stuffy, just turn around and leave, saysDr Hywel Davies,external, technical director of the Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers. He says that it's vital to have a flow of clean air: ""If you've got someone who's infected in a building, and you're bringing in plenty of outside air, you're diluting whatever infectious material they're giving off. You're reducing the risk of other people becoming infected."" From offices to shops, air conditioning is welcome on hot days - but check the type of unit. The simplest is a slender white box mounted on walls or ceilings, known as a split air conditioner. This draws in air from a room, chills it and then blows it back out again. A split air conditioner In other words, it's recirculating the air. This is no problem for a quick visit but may be a risk over a period of hours. Astudy of a restaurant in China,externalblamed this type of air conditioner for spreading the virus. One customer was ""pre-symptomatic"" - in other words, he was infected but did not realise because he had yet to develop symptoms. Scientists reckon he released the virus as he breathed and talked, and it was pushed around the room by swirling air currents from the units on the wall. The result was that nine other people became infected. Dr Davies points again to the importance of fresh air: ""If there had been a good supply of outside air, very likely fewer people would have become infected - if any."" In a modern building where the windows are sealed, how can you get enough fresh air? You're relying on a ventilation system in which stale air is extracted from the rooms and piped to an air handling unit, often on the roof. A rooftop air conditioning unit There, fresh air can be pulled in from outside and mixed with the old inside air, before being sent back into the building. Given the risk of coronavirus infection, the professional advice is to maximise the fresh supply. ""Having 100% outside air or close to 100% is a good thing,"" says Prof Cath Noakes of the University of Leeds and chair of the environmental panel of the government's SAGE advisers, speaking in a personal capacity. ""The more fresh air, the less you're running the risk of recirculating the virus through the building."" The precise mix is decided by the building's managers, who may be working for the owners or the tenants.  . The drawback to running 100% fresh air is the cost - the incoming air has to be heated in winter and cooled in summer, all of which requires energy. A modern ventilation system will have filters but these are not fool-proof. In the US, researchers investigating the Oregon Health & Science University Hospital found that traces of coronavirus were trapped by the filters but some had somehow slipped through. Prof Kevin van den Wymelenberg, who led the project, believes that swabbing the filters could reveal if there's someone infected working in a building. In South Korea, a call centre on the 11th floor of an office building saw one person infect more than 90 others. If the filters had been checked more frequently, the presence of the virus might have been spotted sooner. Prof van den Wymelenberg says data from filters can ""show us where to punch and when to punch"" in tackling infections. Talk to any expert in the field and they will say that fresh air is the key. But one specialist in modelling the movement of air says it's not that simple. Nick Wirth used to design Formula 1 racing cars, and now advises supermarkets and food-processing companies on how to manage air flow to keep people safe. He worries that if someone sitting beside an open window turns out to be infectious, they could shed virus to others downwind. ""If you open a window, where is the air going to go?"" he asks. ""We don't want people in a direct line of that airflow. ""More fresh air in general is better but if it's flowing horizontally and full of virus it could have unintended consequences."" I put this scenario to Prof Cath Noakes. She says the benefits of plentiful fresh air diluting the virus will outweigh any risks. An open window might lead to more people receiving the virus but in smaller, less risky amounts, in her view. It's no surprise there are disagreements - there's a lot we still don't know about the virus. But the air we breathe is bound to be part of any effort to make buildings safer.

The South African, winner in 2010, held a two-stroke advantage after setting a record-breaking pace through 36 holes but it briefly vanished on Saturday. Americans Jordan Spieth and Collin Morikawa closed in to make it a three-way tie before Oosthuizen birdied 17 and edged ahead at 12 under par. It sets up a thrilling final day. All of Sunday's tee-times This video can not be played The Open 2021: Louis Oosthuizen, Collin Morikawa & Jordan Spieth feature in story of day Morikawa is the Oosthuizen's closest challenger at 11 under par after Spieth fell away with a back-to-back bogey finish that dropped him to nine under. American Scottie Scheffler and Canada's Corey Conners are four shots off the lead at eight under par. Scotland's Robert MacIntyre posted the round of the day, a superb five-under-par 65 that included a birdie-birdie finish as he reached four under for the week. He is one behind Ireland's defending champion Shane Lowry and leading English pair Paul Casey and Andy Sullivan, who all sit at five under par. Watch BBC Two highlights: Day three of The Open Low scores were carded when the wind dropped on Friday and organisers responded by setting up tougher pin positions on day three at the Kent links track. That provided more of a test - with the course again bathed in sunshine and tickled by a light breeze - and challenged the field to hold their nerve around the greens. World number two Jon Rahm said they ""may have been some of the hardest pin positions I have ever seen"" after he shot a two-under 68 to move to seven under par. ""You cannot tell on TV but they are almost always on top of a little hill,"" added the US Open champion. ""It's a way of defending the golf course."" And after his round 38-year-old Oosthuizen said: ""The R&A put some pins out there that were questionable. It was tough and I'm glad I held it together."" This video can not be played The Open 2021: McIlroy hits five birdies on the front nine Oosthuizen showed no signs of nerves on the front nine as he carded seven pars and birdied seven and nine to reach 13 under, despite loud roars up ahead alerting him to the fact 2017 champion Spieth was beginning to make a move. At the same time 2020 US PGA Championship winner Morikawa was initially trending in the wrong direction, scrambling to save par from a bunker on the opening hole and continuing his jittery start with a bogey after again finding the sand at the second. The 24-year-old dropped to seven under par, four strokes adrift of Oosthuizen's lead, with a bogey at five before successive birdies at seven and eight and again on 13 and 14 saw him chisel out a gritty two-under 68 and finish on 11 under. ""I don't have much experience on links golf and pretty much all the highlights in my head are from this week,"" said Morikawa. ""Thankfully there are quite a few. ""Hopefully we can just use that momentum from the first three days and bring it into the last 18. It's going to be a gruelling 18, but I look forward to it."" Morikawa's birdie on the par-five 14th moved him into a three-way share of the lead on 11 under after Oosthuizen had bogeyed the par-three 11th and dropped another shot at 13. The South African, six times a runner-up at major championships since his victory at St Andrews 11 years ago, was beginning to look a little tense himself but saved par on 15 and a wry smile suggested he was back in the groove. Moments later, a pin-point tee shot at the par-three 16th set the platform for another birdie and Oosthuizen this time edged into a one-shot advantage that he will take into the final day at the Sandwich venue. ""I was definitely not swinging freely,"" said the world number 13. ""I was a little all over the place with iron shots. I felt like I kept the round together at the end there. ""Finishing second isn't so great, so I will play my heart out and see if I can lift the Claret Jug again."" This video can not be played 'Links golf at it's best' Janewattananond hits creative bunker shot Spieth's putter was proving as warm as the late afternoon sunshine when he sank two birdies in his opening four holes and recovered from a bogey at five with two more birdies to take a share of the lead for the first time in the third round. Even when he found trouble off the tee the three-time major winner was at his scrambling best, making a number of creative shots from the rough and around the edge of the green as he hit the turn in three-under 32 - a start only matched by Cameron Smith among those at the top of the field. Spieth, who dropped out of the world's top 50 last year, is looking to end a four-year wait for a major title after last being successful at Royal Birkdale in 2017. The American, now ranked 23rd in the world, birdied the 10th to reach 12 under par but that was cancelled out on the par-three 11th, though he regained a share of top spot as Oosthuizen stuttered on the back nine. A string of pars looked to be keeping Spieth in the hunt but he bogeyed the 17th and then missed a two-footer for par on the last to leave himself work to do if he is to end his major drought on Sunday. With up to 32,000 spectators allowed on site every day, thousands arrived early to follow a couple of big names in the morning groups, Rory McIlroy and Bryson DeChambeau. Northern Ireland's McIlroy posted five birdies on the front nine to reach four under but could not maintain that momentum and three bogeys following the turn pegged him back to one under par. American DeChambeau, who had a spat with his club manufacturer earlier this week after criticising his driver, is well off the pace at three over after a level-par 70.

"Victoria-May says she received abuse on her account OnlyFans, a social media platform best known for explicit content, has boomed during the pandemic. But from receiving terrorism videos to racial abuse and rape threats, a BBC investigation based on the experiences of dozens of women reveals concerns about how the British-run site is structured, managed and moderated. Warning: Story contains adult themes and language Tina Bean had been living in her car for two months when she started selling nude photos of herself on OnlyFans. The 22-year-old had been kicked out of home after a ""big fight"" and spent most of last summer sleeping in car parks in the heat of Phoenix, Arizona. Everybody else she knew was making ""a hell of a lot of money"" on the site. ""So, I was like, I might as well just jump on it."" She is one of the million content creators on OnlyFans who share photos and videos with subscribers for a monthly fee. In return, the site takes 20% of their earnings. Creators can post a range of content from beauty to fitness videos, but it's widely known for pornography. Soon Tina was making $2,000 (Â£1,450) a month and able to rent her own flat. But in January, a hacker seized control of her account, blackmailed her for $150 and uploaded streams of IS terror videos. The footage, seen and verified by BBC News, depicts people being held hostage in warehouses, or running in fear, before being shot in the head. ""They seemed terrifying,"" she says. ""I kept deleting them and changing my password but kept getting locked out of my account."" The perpetrator then spammed more than 40 of her fans, calling them the N-word, before stealing all of her photos and posting them on a porn site. Tina says after a tortuous cycle of repeatedly being hacked over a month, she reported this to OnlyFans and temporarily disabled her account. She has now lost nearly all of her subscribers and earns just $100 a week - if she's lucky. In a statement, OnlyFans said the account did not have two-factor authentication, which made it vulnerable. The company said Tina did not report the racial slur and it was not detected by the site's moderation system because it was pluralised. It added that this system has now been upgraded and ""in light of this particular incident"", protocols have been updated to ensure that any hacked account's content is fully reviewed before access is restored. Tina's account was hacked OnlyFans became a cultural phenomenon during the pandemic, as lockdowns pushed people online to make and spend money. Founded by Essex businessman Tim Stokely in 2016, it has become one of the UK's fastest-growing tech platforms, with more than 120 million users worldwide. Celebrity endorsements and articles about ordinary women making life-changing amounts of money from selling nudes has boosted its profile, and last year the site handled payments worth Â£1.7bn. The social media platform allows creators to put content behind a paywall and charge a monthly subscription fee - which ranges from $4.99 to $49.99 - for access. Creators can top up their earnings by sharing exclusive pay-per-view posts and receiving tips. OnlyFans thrives on high engagement, and one of its big appeals is that creators and fans can build relationships through livestreams, personalised messages, and direct requests for custom-made photos and videos. Much of the content is explicit - earning it a reputation as the ""paywall of porn"" - and users must be 18 or over to sign up. But behind the glamour of how it is presented, the reality for some has been very different. Tina's experience highlights what creators and digital experts describe as  systemic problems with how OnlyFans is structured, managed, and moderated. The BBC has interviewed dozens of creators in the UK and US, seen copies of complaints and correspondence with OnlyFans, and found: Terror videos, rape threats and racial abuse have been posted on the site in the past year in violation of its terms of service, as well as explicit photos of a student uploaded without her consent Data protection experts have raised concerns about the security of the website's server after creators were hacked, or affected by glitches resulting in nude photos of others appearing on their accounts OnlyFans' policy of granting automatic refunds to fans who are blocked can perpetuate and incentivise abuse, according to creators The site has now adjusted its processes around closing creators' accounts after the BBC questioned why one had her page shut down without explanation, which resulted in it being restored OnlyFans explicitly states on its website that it is ""not responsible"" for moderating content, or detecting breaches of the law or its policies, which includes bans on harassment and sharing illegal or non-consensual images. But it told the BBC that, while it was not legally obliged to proactively review content on the platform, it goes ""above and beyond"" what current regulations require by using community reporting and artificial intelligence software to help keep users safe. The company says it evaluates over 300,000 media files a day, and has more than 500 agents involved in compliance and moderation. It said that all flagged content is reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Digital experts have told the BBC that artificial intelligence can be unreliable for porn, and OnlyFans needs more human moderators as explicit content is more susceptible to issues of abuse or copyright. ""The difference with OnlyFans is the way it's set up,"" says Matt Navarra, a social media consultant. ""Because of the type of content, and the risk it potentially presents to more vulnerable users, the stakes are higher, and therefore the level of responsibility is greater as well."" Charlie, a care leaver and student, joined OnlyFans two years ago, having had a baby OnlyFans creators sell a fantasy - just like the millions of videos freely available on porn sites. Yet in the media, it has developed a reputation as being home to the naughty girl next door, who is more accessible than professional adult entertainers. Tips for customised content can be lucrative, and one 20-year-old student, Charlie, said she has received requests ranging from $50 for a video of her eating a pizza, to $200 for one of her masturbating with sex toys. ""It's not about someone that's just looking for a quick video, like on Pornhub,"" says Victoria-May, a mother-of-two from Northampton. ""It's about relationship building."" Two years ago, the 31-year-old quit her job as a trainee accountant to sell homemade pornography on the site. She says she has now made more than Â£1m. But this hasn't come without difficulties, and she says setting boundaries with some of her ""fans"", who pay $30 a month to view her triple-X-rated photos and videos, has led to a deluge of abuse, rape and death threats. She says that last summer, a male subscriber threatened violence after she declined to have sex with him - and sent messages to her OnlyFans account, including: ""I know where you live. ""I'm going to hunt you down. ""I'm going to kill your children. ""I'm going to rape you. ""I'm going to make your husband watch me as I hurt you, then I'm going to kill you. ""I hope all of your family get Covid and die."" When Victoria-May reported these threats, OnlyFans said ""rude messages"" did not violate its guidelines and the subscribers' account would not be removed. But as the company takes 20% of earnings, she feels it has a duty to take action. Victoria-May says she is one of more than 300 creators earning more than Â£700,000 The site then took six months to respond to more than 20 successive complaints - which were seen by the BBC - including reports of racial abuse directed at participants in her videos. OnlyFans said it handled Victoria-May's complaints ""in a timely manner"" and that any fan reported and found to have been abusive is immediately removed from the platform. It added that it only began to review and investigate suspicious keywords in direct messages from April this year. Stalking, bullying and harassment is against OnlyFans' guidelines and the site says breaches of this policy may lead to accounts being suspended or terminated. For creators who do receive abuse, the site allows them to mute or block that fan. However, the platform automatically gives anyone who has been blocked - regardless of the reason - a refund of their active subscription. Many creators who spoke to the BBC felt this policy was misused by fans and some said it can incentivise them to be rude or provocative, as their monthly subscriptions come to a close. Others added this made them feel penalised for being mistreated. Bell was stalked online by a fan ""The refunds issued to abusive consumers should be re-evaluated,"" says SkylaRayne, 26, a creator from New York. ""We are the ones putting the food on their tables. So, when I'm being harassed and insulted, I'd expect [OnlyFans] to allow me to block someone without them getting a refund. That's just bare minimum."" But creators say that blocked fans are able to create new accounts and sign-up to their pages again. This was the experience of Bell, a 23-year-old model from Manchester, who says she was harassed by a fan last year who was requesting extreme content in return for tips. ""It got very intense, so I decided to cut it off after six months,"" she recalls. ""And they reacted quite badly to that - it was obsessive, obsessive behaviour. ""They were stalking me over multiple accounts, watching me through my friends' stories on Instagram, they had quite a lot of me, so I was worried that they could use this against me."" Bell reported the fan to OnlyFans three times and she says the site later advised blocking him. But he continued to sign-up to her page using multiple new accounts. She told the BBC her experience could have been better if OnlyFans had a live chat function, which would have enabled her concerns to be responded to immediately. The company says Bell was not willing to provide evidence of any specific abuse. It said that on all the occasions the site was contacted by her, it replied promptly with advice and later blocked the IP address of the alleged abusive fan. OnlyFans added that, as a subscription-based platform where fans pay for access and content, it was ""uniquely geared to dissuade and deter abusive behaviour from users"" because, unlike anonymous social media, it could swiftly identify and remove them. OnlyFans is failing to prevent underage users from selling and appearing in explicit videos, according to a BBC investigation. Under-18s have used fake identification to set up accounts, and police say a 14-year-old used her grandmother's passport. The children selling explicit videos on OnlyFans For most creators, the appeal of the site is that photos and videos are locked behind a paywall. Pirating content is illegal, and against OnlyFans' terms of service. But nearly all of the creators spoken to said their images had been leaked and traded by men in other social media and messaging forums. Some told the BBC their photos had been maliciously sent to family members, or that they had been blackmailed into sharing nudes for free or told they would be made public. ""People are naively lulled into a false sense of security from the paywall, that what's behind it stays behind it,"" says Honza Cervenka, a lawyer in the UK specialising in image-based sexual abuse at McAllister Olivarius. ""Legally, content creators give OnlyFans a licence for their content but they keep the copyright,"" he says. ""That leaves the primary responsibility to remedy a leak on content creators, which can be a hard, long and costly legal process."" Risks of being on OnlyFans can also include data protection breaches and hackings, according to creators who shared screenshots about the security of the site. BBC News found that at different times some creators have faced ""glitches"" that have resulted in other peoples' photos appearing on their accounts. Kandii Kitten, 26, was one of those affected, and said an image of a man holding his penis had been posted on her page when she had attempted to upload a nude photo. Another creator, Katja Miyatovich, was hacked while using the platform in May, despite having two-factor authentication security enabled to prevent this. As she was logged-in when it was happening, the 27-year-old from Canada was able to quickly regain access. She shared the email alerting her to the unidentified access to her account with BBC News. ""That is extremely disturbing and definitely a personal data breach,"" says Rowenna Fielding, a data protection consultant. ""Without a doubt that [hacking] should have been investigated and reported to the Information Commissioner's Office."" Tim Turner, who also specialises in data protection, agrees and said that because Katja was hacked despite having two-factor authentication, and these glitches were not a one-off fault, it raises questions about the security of OnlyFans' server. He added that OnlyFans should consider making two-factor authentication mandatory for creators on the platform given the intimate nature of the content. In response, OnlyFans says Katja's account may have been accessed by someone with access to her linked Twitter account and phone number, and says it advised her to utilise the authenticator app instead of SMS verification. It also said it runs a significant takedown team to help creators remove leaked content, with a 75% success rate, and now works with third-party providers to proactively locate, identify and remove stolen content. The site added it was ""very aware of its obligations under data protection laws"" and as with all online platforms, there are sometimes system issues and incidents, which may or may not be data breaches. It said it investigates and reports them as appropriate. Madison, a 22-year-old student from Texas, discovered that her former roommate had been selling topless photos of her on OnlyFans for nearly four months last year without her knowledge. As images on the site are hidden behind a paywall, she had only found out after her images were cross-promoted on Twitter to drive traffic to the account. What had started as a night of playing around and taking what she describes as ""sexy pictures"" with her friends in their dorm, ended with her being exploited and the Polaroids falsely advertised as lesbian content. Her ""gut sank"" at the realisation as she scanned through the pictures on OnlyFans, which were seen by the BBC. ""I like girls who like girls,"" one post read, while another encouraged $5 tips. ""When I think about what she did, it stays with you, that you got used, that she violated me,"" she said. OnlyFans' guidelines ban creators from sharing intimate photos without permission and requires any users making content featuring other people to have written proof of their consent, or says they must also be registered creators. But the BBC understands proof of consent is only requested if an account is flagged or reported, which relies on people being aware that their images are on the site. ""OnlyFans overnight became one of the biggest cowboys in the wild wild West of the [unregulated] porn industry,"" says Kate Isaacs, who campaigns against image-based sexual abuse, known as revenge porn. ""But unfortunately the lack of moderation on the site and ensuring its technology is robust enough to protect people who choose to put their content on there is just seriously lagging behind."" Digital consultants say OnlyFans could deploy more sophisticated, automated technology whereby creators are required to submit recorded proof of consent at the point of upload to proactively prevent this because of the added difficulties the paywall presents for community moderation. Madison's photos were deleted by her ex-roommate after she reported the incident, last May, to state police, who confirmed an investigation is under way. She is now considering taking legal action against the creator. Despite having breached the company's policies, BBC News found the alleged perpetrator is still using OnlyFans under a different pseudonym. OnlyFans said it uses proprietary software as well as manual reviews within its content moderation system to monitor and manage compliance with its terms and conditions. SkylaRayne says the site has transformed her life, but wants the refund policy re-evaluated OnlyFans' position in the porn world became more prominent after payment providers Mastercard and Visaended their relationshipwith PornHub followingallegationsof unlawful content last year. Many of its performers relocated to OnlyFans. Brian Honigman, a marketing consultant and adjunct professor at New York University, said OnlyFans should over-commit to moderation to safeguard its user base. ""And at the end of the day, this does protect your long-term ability to generate revenue and be a profitable business,"" he says. ""The subscription model is great, and the paywall is great when used correctly, but it's important that platforms like OnlyFans make sure they're being used in a way that leads to positive impacts."" Many of the creators who spoke to BBC News still use OnlyFans and say, financially at least, it has transformed their lives. But they have spoken out in the hope it would lead to them receiving better support. As one said: ""They need to protect the people that made them that platform in the first place."" Creators' names have been used and Madison's name has been changed.

"Fully jabbed travellers returning to England and Wales from France will still have to quarantine from Monday. From 19 July, adults who have been double jabbed in the UK arriving from amber list countries will not need to isolate for 10 days. But the government said the easing would not apply to France due to ""persistent"" cases of the Beta variant, first identified in South Africa. There are concerns vaccines may not work as well against the Beta variant. The Beta variant accounts for about 10% of new infections in France, but that includes the Indian Ocean territories of Reunion and Mayotte, where the variant is near-universal. The more infectious Delta variant - first identified in India - accounts for almost all new cases in the UK. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""We have always been clear that we will not hesitate to take rapid action at our borders to stop the spread of Covid-19 and protect the gains made by our successful vaccination programme. ""With restrictions lifting on Monday across the country, we will do everything we can to ensure international travel is conducted as safely as possible, and protect our borders from the threat of variants."" Travel firms have criticised the move, accusing the government of causing confusion. Willie Walsh, the director-general of the International Air Transport Association said ""the UK has no coherent policy on international travel"" and is ""destroying its own travel sector and the thousands of jobs that rely on it"". How are summer holiday rules changing on Monday? How can I prove I'm fully vaccinated? How dangerous are new variants? The government announcement means that anyone who has been in France in the previous 10 days will need to quarantine on arrival to England in their own accommodation and will need a day two and day eight test, regardless of their vaccination status. This includes any fully vaccinated individual who transits through France from either a green or another amber country. But ministers indicated that Eurostar passengers on services travelling through France would not need to quarantine if their train did not stop in the country. Existing amber list exemptions for key workers such as hauliers will remain in place. Meanwhile, France has tightened its rules for UK travellers who are not fully vaccinated, requiring a negative test in the 24 hours before arrival from Sunday, rather than the 48 hours allowed previously. But anyone fully vaccinated with a jab from Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, AstraZeneca or Johnson & Johnson will be exempt from providing a negative test. French MEP Veronique Trillet-Lenoir told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that it was ""difficult to understand"" the UK rules, as the Beta variant is ""not present at all"" in mainland France, with France's cases mainly being found in its overseas territories. BBC Paris correspondent Hugh Schofield said there had been no official response from the French government yet, but it would be pushing for an explanation from its London counterpart for the toughened policy. Travellers to the UK from France will still have the option of shortening their quarantine period throughthe Test to Release scheme,external- if they pay for a test on day five and are negative. For arrivals from other amber list countries, the requirement to quarantine is being scrapped for the fully vaccinated and under-18s from Monday in all parts of the UK. Each UK nation sets its own travel rules. A Scottish government spokesperson said ministers were ""considering the best approach"" for arrivals from France ""as we look to adopt a four nation approach on international travel, where possible"". Wales said it would be following the change set by England, while Northern Ireland is yet to announce its intention. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? LOCKDOWN RULES:What are they and when will they end? VACCINE:When will I get the jab? Prof John Edmunds, an epidemiologist from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and a government adviser on the Sage committee, said the Beta variant was at low levels in the UK but, as immunity from vaccines increases, ""conditions are right"" for it to gain an advantage. He told the Today programme that the Beta variant is probably less infectious than the dominant Delta variant, but it appears to be better able to evade the immune response from vaccines - particularly from the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. The UK is currently facing a ""long and drawn out"" wave of infections from the Delta variant, he said, as it will not be brought down by lockdowns as previous peaks were. He said cases are on course to hit 100,000 a day in about two weeks, although school closures may help to bring down the surge or cause it to level off. But high levels of infection were likely throughout the rest of the summer and autumn, he said. Travel trade body Abta said the changes to travel to France will delay ""any meaningful recovery for the industry"", adding that financial support needed to be given to the sector. Tim Alderslade, chief executive of industry group Airlines UK, said: ""These random rule changes make it almost impossible for travellers and industry to plan ahead, and can only further undermine consumer trust at the very peak of the summer season."" Johan Lundgren, chief executive of EasyJet, said the government was ""making it up as they go along and causing confusion and uncertainty"". Labour said the move had created ""complete chaos"". Shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said: ""In effect the government has announced yet another category for travel and they've done it on a Friday evening... It is travellers and the travelling industry that is paying the price."" Georgina Thomas, a nurse from Buckinghamshire, is one of those affected by the change. The 32-year-old has been visiting her parents in the countryside between La Rochelle and Bordeaux for the last three weeks with her baby daughter. ""I'm frustrated with the inconsistent approach the government are taking, it doesn't all appear logical,"" she told the PA news agency. ""If a quarantine is necessary then so be it but I'm confident that my risk will be higher when I return to the UK."" Ms Thomas, who is still on maternity leave, added: ""It will be a long 10 days but we are the fortunate ones, I understand that, plenty will think we shouldn't be travelling anyway."" James Miles from West Sussex said the quarantine requirement had put his plans to visit his girlfriend in France for the first time since 1 January in jeopardy. ""This is really affecting people's lives,"" he said. ""Seven months is a long time not to see your partner. I can't even see the light at the end of the tunnel. Where do we go from here?"" This video can not be played James Miles says his plans to visit his partner in France have been thrown into doubt Anne, a British citizen living in Paris who did not wish to give her second name, has not seen her family in 18 months, with her parents yet to meet their granddaughter, who was born in Paris last autumn. The 31-year-old told the BBC she had booked their trip to London for late August on Friday morning - just hours before the announcement was made. She also suggested most of the Beta variant cases were not found in mainland France. ""How can the government encourage non vaccinated people in the UK to stop wearing masks and start going clubbing, yet oblige fully vaccinated travellers from France to quarantine?"" Anne added. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said: ""Whilst we are committed to continuing to open up international travel safely, our absolute priority is to protect public health here in the UK."" There had been reports the government was considering adding France to the red list for travel. Only UK or Irish nationals or UK residents are allowed to travel from red list countries and they must then quarantine in a government-approved hotel for 10 days, at a cost of Â£1,750 for one adult. It comes just two days after the government announced popular holiday destinations Ibiza, Majorca, Menorca and Formenterawould be moved to the amber list. In other developments: Chairman of the Commons health select committee Jeremy Hunt warned that Covid restrictions may have to be reintroduced if cases are still rising when schools return in September. He also said the ""warning light on the NHS dashboard... is flashing red"" with hospital admissions expected to rise to 10,000 by the end of August The Trades Union Congress has called on the government to ""fix sick pay"" amid rising numbers of people being asked to self-isolate. Deputy general secretary Paul Nowak said many people cannot afford the time off work Bulgaria has announced a ban on UK travellers entering the country amid rising cases On Friday,more than 50,000 daily coronavirus cases were reported in the UKfor the first time since mid-January.

"Hippos, walruses and whales could receive greater legal protection under UK government proposals to crack down on ivory poaching. Ministers want to extend theIvory Act,externalbecause they say elephants are not the only animals at risk. Conservationists have welcomed the move as sending a ""clear signal to the rest of the world"". Boris Johnson has previously announced that funding to tackle the illegal wildlife trade will be increased. UK ivory ban to be 'toughest' in the world William warns of 'horrifying' poaching Â£3bn UK climate finance to be spent on supporting nature The Ivory Act, which gained Royal Assent in 2018, will introduce a near total ban on the import, export and dealing of items containing elephant ivory in the UK, but it has not yet become law. Now the environment department says it needs to go further. Under the new plans - which open for public consultation on Saturday - it  would be broadened to cover other animals facing threats from hunters. Ministers say hippos are also at risk from poachers, while killer whales and sperm whales are targeted for their teeth and narwhals and walruses for their tusks. The consultation puts forward three options: retaining the current ban on elephant ivory in the UK only, extending the Act to hippo ivory only, and extending it the five listed species. International Environment Minister Lord Goldsmith said: ""The Ivory Act is one of the toughest bans of its kind in the world and sends a clear message that we are doing all that we can to save elephants from the threat of extinction. ""However the ivory trade is a conservation threat for other magnificent species such as the hippo, narwhal and walrus that are at threat. ""So I urge everyone to share their views to help ensure we can protect more animals from the grim ivory trade."" Dr Mark Jones, head of policy at the Born Free Foundation, said: ""Closing down elephant ivory markets is an essential step towards securing a future for elephants. ""However, by focusing only on the trade in elephant ivory, other ivory-bearing species could suffer as ivory traders and consumers turn to alternatives. ""By taking this step, the UK can send a clear signal to the rest of the world that killing animals to carve ornaments from their teeth is not acceptable in the 21st century.""

""So I urge everyone to share their views to help ensure we can protect more animals from the grim ivory trade."" Dr Mark Jones, head of policy at the Born Free Foundation, said: ""Closing down elephant ivory markets is an essential step towards securing a future for elephants. ""However, by focusing only on the trade in elephant ivory, other ivory-bearing species could suffer as ivory traders and consumers turn to alternatives. ""By taking this step, the UK can send a clear signal to the rest of the world that killing animals to carve ornaments from their teeth is not acceptable in the 21st century."" The prime minister has previously announced that funding to tackle the illegal wildlife trade will be increased as part of the Â£220 million International Biodiversity Fund.
