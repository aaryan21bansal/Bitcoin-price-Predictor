"This video can not be played Mariano Rajoy said fresh elections would be held Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy is dissolving the Catalan parliament and calling snap local elections after MPs there voted to declare independence. Mr Rajoy said the unprecedented imposition of direct rule on Catalonia was essential to ""recover normality"". He is also firing Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont and his cabinet. The crisis began when Catalan leaders held an independence referendum, defying a ruling by the Constitutional Court which had declared it illegal. Barca coach ducks Catalan crisis questions Catalonia crisis: What next for Spain? What powers does Catalonia have? The Catalan government said that of the 43% of potential voters who took part, 90% were in favour of independence. Others boycotted the vote after the court ruling. On Friday the Spanish Senate granted Mr Rajoy's government the power to impose direct rule on Catalonia, and after an emergency cabinet meeting Mr Rajoy spelled out what that would entail. ""The president [Carles Puigdemont] had the opportunity to return to legality and to call elections,"" he said. ""It is what the majority of the Catalonian people asked for - but he didn't want to do it. So the government of Spain is taking the necessary measures to return to legality."" Regional elections are scheduled for 21 December. Mr Rajoy also announced the sacking of the Catalan police chief. By Sarah Rainsford, BBC News, Madrid Spain's prime minister may have hoped warning Catalonia against declaring independence would be enough. Now he has to follow through on his pledge to impose direct rule, knowing this is highly risky. Mariano Rajoy argues that Catalan separatists left him no choice. He had to act, to return the region to ""legality"", as Madrid puts it. But actually doing that will be complex and highly fraught. It's why Mr Rajoy called for calm in Spain, after the Catalan vote for independence. He is acting with broad, cross-party support though, and public backing. Here in Madrid many people have begun flying the Spanish national flag from their windows and balconies, to show their support for keeping the country united. There is some sympathy for the Catalan cause, mostly because of the police crackdown during the referendum. But far louder are calls to prosecute those pushing for independence. It's a move which many Spaniards, like their government, are convinced was illegal. A motion declaring independence was approved on Friday with 70 in favour, 10 against, and two abstentions in the 135-seat chamber. Several opposition MPs boycotted the vote. This video can not be played The moment Catalan parliament declared independence Mr Puigdemont has urged supporters to ""maintain the momentum"" in a peaceful manner. Separatists say the move means they no longer fall under Spanish jurisdiction. But the Spanish Constitutional Court is likely to declare it illegal, while the EU, the US, the UK, Germany and France all expressed support for Spanish unity. EU faces danger of ""more cracks"" appearing in bloc The case for and against independence Reality Check: Police violence in Catalonia Meanwhile Spanish prosecutors say they will file charges of ""rebellion"" against Mr Puigdemont next week. Thousands celebrated the declaration of independence on the streets of Barcelona, Catalonia's regional capital. As the outcome of the vote became clear, people popped open cava, the local sparkling wine. This video can not be played At times there were tensions between opposing sets of demonstrators. The same crowds that cheered each Yes vote from Catalan MPs were reportedly booing Mr Rajoy as he made his announcement. There have been pro-unity demonstrations too, with protesters in Barcelona waving Spanish flags and denouncing Catalan independence. After the 1 October referendum, Mr Puigdemont signed a declaration of independence but delayed implementation to allow talks with the Spanish government. The Spanish flag was swiftly removed from Girona City Hall on Friday He ignored warnings by the Madrid government to cancel the move, prompting Mr Rajoy to first announce his plans to remove Catalan leaders and impose direct rule. Catalonia is one of Spain's richest, most distinctive regions with a high degree of autonomy. But many Catalans feel they pay more to Madrid than they get back, and there are historical grievances, too, in particular Catalonia's treatment under the dictatorship of General Franco. Catalans are divided on the question of independence - an opinion poll earlier this year said 41% were in favour and 49% were opposed to independence. Does Catalonia want to leave Spain?

"This video can not be played Alexander Stubb tells Today it will take more than 30 years for UK to get Â£3bn EIB investment back Billions of euros of British taxpayers' money could remain locked into an EU bank for more than thirty years after Brexit, the UK has been warned. Alexander Stubb, vice president of the European Investment Bank - in which the UK is a 16% shareholder - said it would not be fully repaid until 2054. He described Brexit as a ""travesty"" but denied the move was a punishment. ""The EIB has leveraged the economy of the UK many, many fold over the years,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today. EU 'is preparing for no deal Brexit' No free trade with poorer countries call The UK has 3.5bn euros (Â£3.1bn) of capital at the bank and a House of Lords report said the UK's investment could be worth 10.1bn (Â£8.9bn) euros taking into account reserves and profits. Established in 1958, the EIB uses capital provided by EU countries to make loans at low rates, often for major infrastructure projects. All 28 EU nations are shareholders in the Luxembourg-based bank, with the UK being the largest alongside Germany, France and Italy. Mr Stubb, a former prime minister of Finland, told the BBC that the UK's money could be tied up for decades in after it leaves the EU in 2019. ""Everyone on both sides of the negotiating table agree that we have to pay back the 3.5 billion euro, basically in cash, and that will happen over a long period, up until 2054, because that's when the loans are amortised."" He insisted that no-one in the bank wanted to ""punish"" the UK for leaving and actually wanted to ""alleviate the pain"" of Brexit. ""I have a British heart pumping, I am married to a Brit, my children have dual nationality and I think Brexit is one of the biggest travesties that we have seen in the modern era,"" he said. ""So I will do everything in my power to alleviate the pain, but the economic facts are just such that there are no winners in Brexit - apart from perhaps a few lawyers. Unfortunately, we will see this in the coming years."" The BBC's Ross Hawkins said Today had heard how delays in authorising new loans while the UK remains part of the EU could see fewer social homes built. One housing association, Stonewater, said it may build around 300 fewer homes because its application for Â£100m to build new properties had ground to a halt. Its executive director John Bruton told the programme: ""The Bank has been waiting for assurances from the UK government before the application can be progressed.""

"Valentino Talluto was arrested in November 2015 An Italian man has been jailed for 24 years after intentionally infecting 30 women with HIV. Valentino Talluto is said to have had unprotected sex with at least 53 women after his HIV diagnosis in 2006, the youngest of whom was 14 at the relationship's start. The accountant, using the pseudonym ""Hearty Style"", went on social networks and dating sites to find his victims. On Friday, judges sentenced the 33-year-old to 24 years in prison. Talluto's defence lawyers had argued their client's actions were ""imprudent, but not intentional"". 'My ex told everyone I had HIV' However, those who asked him to wear a condom were told he was either allergic, or had recently been tested for HIV, news agency AFP reported. When some of the women confronted him after discovering they were infected, he denied he was a carrier of the potentially deadly virus, which can lead to Aids. As a result of his actions, another four people contracted the virus on top of the women he directly infected: three men and one baby. Prosecutor Elena Neri told the court last month: ""His actions were intended to sow death."" However, Talluto - whose mother was an HIV-infected drug addict who died when he was four - told the court if that had been the case, he would not have gone to the effort of having actual relationships. ""Many of the girls know my friends and family,"" he said. ""They say that I wanted to infect as many people as possible. If that had been the case, I would have gone for casual sex in bars, I would not have brought them into my life."" Judges in Rome deliberated over the sentence for more than 10 hours before announcing the verdict. According to local media, victims wept as the sentence was read out. However, it fell short of the life term prosecutors had asked for.

"Detectives Rich Morgan and Ed Clouse interviewed Mrs Stevens earlier this week A New York woman who vanished 42 years ago has been found living with dementia in an elderly care home in Massachusetts, police say. Flora Stevens went missing in August 1975 after her husband dropped her off at a doctor's appointment in Monticello, New York. Investigators located Mrs Stevens while working on a separate cold case. Police who interviewed the 78-year-old said they have not been able to confirm her whereabouts due to her condition. Mrs Stevens was a 36-year-old employee at a Catskills resort when she disappeared in Monticello, about 70 miles (110km) from New York City. Police solved the case when a New York state investigator contacted the Sullivan County Sheriff's Office in September about skeletal remains found in Orange County, New York, that roughly matched the description of Mrs Stevens. Sheriff's Detective Rich Morgan searched federal and state databases to locate a relative of Mrs Stevens for a DNA sample to help identify the remains when he discovered that someone had been using her social security in Massachusetts. ""It's not too often we get to solve a 42-year-old missing-person case,"" Sullivan County Sheriff Mike Schiff said in a statement. ""The main thing is we know Flora is safe."" She was using the name Flora Harris when detectives tracked her down at an elderly care facility Lowell, about 23 miles (37km) northwest of Boston. Mrs Stevens immediately recognised herself in her Concord Hotel security pass Detectives on Tuesday showed her an old photo ID from the Concord Hotel, where she had been working at the time of her disappearance. ""She says 'that's me', or 'me,'"" Detective Morgan said. ""She responded with one word, 'me,'"" he explained. Her medical records showed that she had lived in care homes in New Hampshire and New York City before she arrived in Lowell in 2001. Investigators added ""because of her illness, it is still a mystery how and why she disappeared"". She has no living relatives and her estranged husband died in 1985, according to police.

"Council leisure facilities 'need a cash boost' At a town hall meeting last week, Pendle Council in Lancashire heard a solution to a looming Â£4m deficit may be to close a sports hall or pool. Councillors told the meeting such a closure would be unacceptable, and urged every effort to keep the borough's three leisure centres open. Across England, cash-strapped councils are struggling to run and maintain sports centres, say town hall bosses. The government said it was for councils to decide how to spend their budgets. But the Local Government Association, representing councils in England, says ministers should commit Â£400m in next month's Budget to upgrade and renovate leisure facilities. The cash is crucial to combat major health issues like obesity, diabetes and heart disease, it argues. It warns that the majority of council-owned sports halls and swimming pools are at risk of becoming ""old and tired"" as local authorities' budgets become increasingly squeezed, leaving them unable to afford the cost of refurbishments. In the 10 years to 2020, councils will have seen a Â£16bn reduction in core government funding, says the LGA. It leaves them having to plough all their existing resources into meeting the increasing demand for adult and children's social care and tackling homelessness, at the expense of investing in leisure facilities. Coleford pool in Forest of Dean is over 30 years old At Coleford in the Forest of Dean, the local leisure centre needs significant investment to keep it open in the medium term, and the council says finding this additional money without impacting on other services for the community is not possible. ""The leisure centre is over 30 years old and needs major investment to bring it up to standard - in fact, ultimately it really needs replacing and we can't afford to do it on our own,"" explained a council spokesman. The most recent figures from Sport England showed 58% of sports halls and 60% of swimming pools were more than 20 years old in 2015 - and of these nearly a quarter had not been refurbished in 20 years. ""Councils are doing all they can to keep leisure centres up and running, but many are in desperate need of refurbishment,"" said Gerald Vernon-Jackson, chairman of the LGA's culture, tourism and sport board. ""Government has a chance in the autumn Budget to breathe new life into our leisure centres, which saves them from falling beyond repair and forcing them to close."" Pendle Leisure Centre bosses hope to boost revenue At Coleford, the council, along with the trust which runs the centre, says it is doing all it can to ensure it stays open. ""The community have a lot of aspirations for the site, and as a council we need to take a broad, long-term view,"" added the spokesman. ""We will have to look to partner funding, perhaps with national sporting bodies or health providers, if we are able to achieve people's desire to create a community hub with a range of facilities."" In Pendle, the leisure centre trust is proposing increasing revenue by turning one sports hall into a soft play area and dance studio - though some local groups say this will leave them with nowhere to train. A spokesman for the Department of Communities and Local Government said: ""Our historic four-year funding settlement provides councils with Â£200bn and the certainty to plan ahead. ""It's for councils themselves to determine how they spend this on services that people want and expect, such as leisure facilities.""

"All the men in the lecture were required to remove their headwear (stock image) A row has erupted in Germany after a university lecturer told a Muslim woman she should remove her headscarf. Professor Gisela MÃ¼ller-Brandeck-Bocquet has been accused of ""discrimination"" after asking everyone at the University of WÃ¼rzburg lecture to take off their headwear.

"Jason Derulo, Greg James, Jessie Ware, Charlie Puth, Dotty and guitarist wrap up the first episode of SLFN ""I cannot stress it enough: this is a gig."" Warm-up man Stuart Holdham is laying the ground rules for the studio audience at Sounds Like Friday Night, a brand new pop show on BBC One. ""Don't clap along to the music because you should be dancing,"" he continues. ""And if I see any dad dancing, you'll be removed from the studio, driven to Manchester and forced to watch six hours of Jeremy Kyle."" For all of his humour, there's no mistaking it: this is a big deal for the BBC. Since Top of the Pops and CD:UK died in 2006, there hasn't been a dedicated pop programme on mainstream TV. It has become  industry consensus that audiences don't want to see live music in their living room. That's why, X Factor aside, pop bands have had to fight for slots at the end of The One Show or the end of Graham Norton. Always at the end. Always as the credits roll. So Sounds Like Friday Night is something of a gamble. (A gamble which bizarrely, and perhaps unintentionally, borrows its title from a short-livedLeo Sayer show,externalin 1978.) BBC One - Sounds Like Friday Night Derulo on basketball and music TV shows Greg James and Dotty: ""It felt like this was a confident start"" ""It's a truly remarkable thing,"" says host Greg James, a couple of days before the programme launches. ""The BBC have gone, 'Do you know what? Let's do a live music show and put it on BBC One!'"" He says he's ""obviously very nervous"" at launching a new programme, but ""I don't feel it's something I can't do"". ""It's not rocket science. It's a half-hour show with some great music and some fun bits that people can hopefully sit down at the end of the week and enjoy."" Ah yes, the ""fun bits"". This is what stops #SLFN (as it's known on social media) being a mere reboot of Top of the Pops. The chart countdown has been consigned to the dustbin, and the show is peppered with sketches and interviews, which are instantlyavailable to share on YouTube and social media,external. ""It's a lot more than music performances,"" says James's co-host Dotty. ""We're hoping we can create moments that live outside of the show."" Sounds Like Friday Night had an average audience of 2.2 million viewers for its first show - lower than average for that timeslot, but respectable for a new show. It has been given a challenging slot, pitting it against ITV's Coronation Street - which attracts an average audience of 6.8 million viewers. A Question of Sport, which regularly takes the same slot on BBC One, averages three million viewers per episode. Top of the Pops, which was also scheduled against Friday night's episode of Coronation Street towards the end of its 42-year run, attracted an average of 2.4 million viewers to its last four episodes on BBC One. However, the BBC has avoided setting a public target for Sounds Like Friday Night's viewing figures. Instead, it hopes the show will have a ""second life"" on social media, with clips and sketches being shared on YouTube and the BBC iPlayer for weeks after the initial broadcast. The template is Adele's successful ""At The BBC"" show, which mixed chat and performances with a sketch in which the star auditioned as an Adele impersonator. That clip has beenwatched more than 82 million times on YouTube,external. Record labels will be watching sales and streaming figures on Saturday to see whether SLFN's first guests - Jason Derulo, Charlie Puth and Jessie Ware - receive a similar boost from their appearance on the programme. But whatever happens, music fans are eager for a new pop show. The studio audience for the first episode came not just from the UK but from Sweden, Germany, and even the US. Music fans Dan, from Devon, and Brooke, from Rhode Island, were amongst the studio audience ""I watched Top of the Pops growing up,"" said Dan Law, who travelled from Devon to be first in the queue. ""It was a shame when it ended, but this seems like a class show. I think it's a modern way of looking at music."" ""Everyone likes music,"" said Brooke, originally from Rhode Island, ""so it's fun to add the comedy and things to it"". ""It's a different kind of entertainment,"" agreed Ozlem Halibryam and Khadijah Ahmed, two Charlie Puth fans who were ""too young"" to remember the original Top Of The Pops. ""I think it's a nice way to chill on a Friday night,"" added Ahmed. ""I think it would be good to have more shows like this, more often."" Inside Television Centre's Studio One, the audience were greeted by a vast, multi-storey coliseum that appeared to have been borrowed from a steampunk production of West Side Story. The fans screamed when Derulo swivelled his hips and swooned when Jessie Ware sang her lush ballad Alone. But the sketches were more divisive. A clip in which Foo Fighters star Dave Grohl impersonated a BBC One continuity announcer was met with befuddled silence. Better received was a sketch featuring Jason Derulo's attempts to play basketball while being pelted with tennis balls - but even that dragged on too long. In the end, the audience just wanted music (this was a gig, after all) and enthusiastically joined in with Derulo's acoustic rendition of Want To Want Me at the end of the show.

"Listen Without Prejudice features such songs as Praying for Time and Waiting for That Day Pop star George Michael has topped the UK album charts, 10 months after his death. An expanded version of his second solo album, Listen Without Prejudice Vol 1, beat Niall Horan and Pink to become the week's best-selling record. It means Michael's album has spent two weeks at number one, 27 years apart. But CD sales have collapsed in the meantime. In 1990 the album sold 423,577 copies to top the chart. This week, it shifted just 56,000 copies. Nonetheless, Michael was 30,000 sales ahead of Pink, his nearest rival, whose Beautiful Trauma album fell one place to number two. She overtook Horan, whose debut album Flicker had been number two in the midweek sales update. The Irish One Direction star ended up at number three instead. In the singles chart, Post Malone celebrated a fourth week at number one with his breakthrough track,Rockstar,external. He held Camila Cabello'sHavana,externalat bay for a third week, outselling the former Fifth Harmony singer by just 5,000 copies. Mysterious DJ and producer Marshmello - who keeps his identity a secret - looks set to challenge both artists next week, after his songSilence,externalrose from nine to three. Cabello could also see a boost after releasing the video for Havana on Tuesday. Filmed as an campy, old-school Spanish soap opera, the clip has already been watched 21 million times. Camila Cabello will appear at the MTV Europe Music Awards in November Ed Sheeran's romantic balladPerfect,externalalso returned to the Top 10, rising four places to number seven. It initially charted at four when his album, Divide, was released in March. Taylor Swift claimed this week's highest new entry withGorgeous,externalat number 15, while Rita Ora returned at 20 with her new single,Anywhere,external. Liam Payne'sBedroom Door,externaldebuted at 28, while Krept and Konan's collaboration with Stormzy,Ask Flipz,external, was a new entry at 30. Listen Without Prejudice Vol 1 was re-released last week to coincide with a new TV documentary about Michael, titled Freedom. Featuring the singlesPraying for Time,externalandFreedom 90,external, it outsold his debut album in the UK but was a relative flop in America - something Michael blamed on a lack of support from his US label. In 1992 he took Sony to court, alleging they treated him as ""no more than a piece of software"". He eventually lost the case, but it kept him away from music for five years and permanently affected his career in the US. In Freedom, the documentary he was working on shortly before his death on Christmas Day 2016, the star said he regretted the legal action. David Austin, Michael's former manager and childhood friend, said he was ""incredibly proud"" to see Listen Without Prejudice return to the top spot.

"President Kennedy was shot dead in Dallas on 22 November 1963 Thousands of previously classified documents relating to the assassination of President John F Kennedy in 1963 have been released by the US government. Since the publication, President Donald Trumphas said he will release all remaining files,externalother than the names and addresses of anyone mentioned who is still living - some of the documents have been withheld at the request of government agencies. As people examine all 2,800 files so far released, here are the most interesting points so far. NB many files contain unverified raw intelligence. In a memo written the day assassin Lee Harvey Oswald was killed,FBI director J Edgar Hoover expressed concern about the spread of conspiracy theories,external. ""The thing I am concerned about is having something issued so that we can convince the public that Oswald is the real assassin,"" he said. A memo from the CIA, based on an intercepted phone call, suggestsOswald spoke with a KGB officer at the Russian embassy,externalin Mexico City. It says that on 28 September 1963 he spoke with Valery Vladimirovich Kostikov, an ""identified KGB officer"" who worked for a department ""responsible for sabotage and assassination"". Oswald later called the embassy and, in ""broken Russian"", asked if there was ""anything new concerning the telegram to Washington"". This video can not be played What will top-secret JFK files tell us about Kennedy's killer? Oswald, who shot and killed President Kennedy, was quickly arrested and charged. But two days later Oswald was shot dead in the basement of the Dallas police department by Jack Ruby, a local nightclub owner. But could more have been done to protect him? One memo reveals the FBI had warned Dallas police of a death threat,externalmade against Oswald. FBI director J Edgar Hoover said: ""We at once notified the chief of police and he assured us Oswald would be given sufficient protection. However, this was not done."" This video can not be played A British nurse was in the Dallas hospital when JFK was shot The idea of a leaderless United States did not appeal to some Soviet officials. They ""were fearful that without leadership, some irresponsible general in the United States might launch a missile at the Soviet Union"", according to one memo. It also says the Soviets were ""convinced the assassination was not the deed of one man"",externalbut rather a ""carefully planned campaign in which several people played a part"". The FBI warned the president's brother, US Attorney General Robert F Kennedy, his alleged affair with Marilyn Monroe would be exposed in a book. A letter on 7 July 1964 from the bureau to the younger Kennedy said the paperback, The Strange Death of Marilyn Monroe, would allege he had ""an intimate relationship with Miss Monroe"". Monroe died at the age of 36 in Los Angeles in 1962 According to the FBI, the author would suggest the film star ""was led to believe his intentions were serious"" and that RFK had promised to divorce his wife and marry the sex symbol. But when he refused to do so, Monroe ""threatened to expose their relationship"" and ruin his presidential ambitions. The FBI said the book would allege that RFK took ""drastic action"" by plotting to have Monroe killed and make it look like a suicide. The letter advised RFK the book would also allege he was at her apartment on the night of her death. Agents wrote that RFK ""was actually in San Francisco with his wife at the time Marilyn Monroe committed suicide"". The actress died at the age of 36 in Los Angeles in August 1962 from a barbiturate overdose, according to the city coroner's office. An FBI memo from before Kennedy was elected president describesattempts by a private detective to spy on the then senator,external. It says a ""high priced Hollywood call girl"" told FBI agents that private detective Fred Otash had contacted her to ask about Senator Kennedy's involvement in ""sex parties"". The private detective also suggested equipping the woman with ""a recording device"" to take down any ""indiscreet statements"" from Senator Kennedy. She refused, and said she was unaware of any ""indiscretions"". One memo describes how a British local newspaper, the Cambridge News, received an anonymous call about ""some big news"" in the US, just 25 minutes before the assassination. ""The caller said only that the Cambridge News reporter should call the American embassy in London for some big news and then hung up"", it says. A copy of the memo was released by the National Archives,externalin the US in July, but had gone unreported. One document reveals an operation to assassinate top Cuban leaders,externaland offers of up to $100,000 for ""killing or delivering alive"" government officials. But for Fidel Castro the payment offered was of only $0.02. Fidel Castro moments after he toppled Fulgencio Batista in January 1959 Another document, however, suggests that the price for killing Castro was $150,000 and that there were alleged contacts between Cuban exiles and the mafia. Government ideas about how to kill Castro included contaminating Mr Castro's diving suit with disease-causing bacteria or poisoning his food. An FBI report alleges that President Lyndon B Johnson, who took office after President Kennedy was killed, may have been a member of the KKK. An informant said the white supremacist group had ""documentedproof that President Johnson was formerly a member of the Klan in Texas,externalduring the early days of his political career"".

"Theresa May and Spanish PM Mariano Rajoy in 2016 The UK will not recognise the Catalan parliament's declaration of independence, Downing Street says. Theresa May's official spokesman said the declaration was based on a vote that had been declared illegal. The Scottish government said it understood and respected Catalonia's position. The Catalan regional parliamenthas voted to declare independence from Spain, while the Spanish parliament has approved direct rule over the region. Catalan independence crisis escalates What powers does Catalonia have? Moment Catalans declare independence Scotland 'respects Catalan position' The UK prime minister's spokesman said in a statement: ""The UK does not and will not recognise the unilateral declaration of independence made by the Catalan regional parliament. ""It is based on a vote that was declared illegal by the Spanish courts. We continue to want to see the rule of law upheld, the Spanish constitution respected, and Spanish unity preserved."" Catalan MPs backed the independence motion 70-10 in a ballot boycotted by the opposition. Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy had told senators direct rule was needed to return ""law, democracy and stability"" to Catalonia. Scotland's Cabinet Secretary for Culture, Tourism and External Affairs, Fiona Hyslop, said: ""We understand and respect the position of the Catalan government. ""While Spain has the right to oppose independence, the people of Catalonia must have the ability to determine their own future. ""Today's declaration of independence came about only after repeated calls for dialogue were refused."" Ms Hyslop added that direct rule was not a solution and that Spain's decision to impose it ""should be of concern to democrats everywhere"". She called on the EU to resolve the crisis peacefully and democratically. Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry said the dispute had been turned into a ""binary choice"" between independence and direct rule. ""It is not what the majority in Catalonia and Spain actually want,"" she said. ""They want a sensible, political dialogue about finding a resolution."" Boris Johnson spoke to reporters in Lisbon UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson earlier offered his support to the Spanish PM. After a meeting with Portugal's foreign minister in Lisbon, he said: ""We don't think, as far as we understand the matter, that the referendum on independence was well-founded in law.

"Five offshore PFI companies paid little or no corporation tax during a five-year period despite making profits of nearly Â£2bn, the BBC has learned. The five companies specialised in lending money through Private Finance Initiatives (PFI). They own hundreds of public assets including schools, hospitals and even police stations. The BBC has also learned that a small number of big offshore companies are currently on a buying spree. They are buying up a number of the UK's public buildings. Research carried out by the think tank that investigates PFI deals, the European Services Strategy Unit, reveals the extent of the buy-up in Britain. Nine off-shore infrastructure funds own between 50% and 100% of the equity in 335 PFI/Public Private Partnership (PPP) projects. This amounts to 45% of all 735 current projects 12 offshore companies have bought equity in 74% of the 735 current projects Education and health projects, including schools and hospitals, account for two-thirds of the purchases by offshore companies Meg Hillier, the Labour MP who chairs the Public Accounts Select Committee, told the BBC'sThe World Tonight: ""Frankly it is shocking. Our taxes are paying for our schools and hospitals... and yet these companies are clearly profiting and paying no UK tax. I don't think that was ever envisaged when PFI was established."" Ms Hillier, MP for Hackney South and Shoreditch, also expressed concern at the concentration of so many public assets in so few hands offshore. ""I think nobody foresaw this sale of the debt on to companies and this conglomeration. Now we have so few companies owning such a large amount of the debt and that is a big concern."" She described UK public assets as a ""cash cow"" adding: ""Now there is a very big gap between the owner of the debt and the service and organisation paying for it."" Dexter Whitfield, Director of the European Services Strategy Unit Dexter Whitfield heads the European Services Strategy Unit which carried out the PFI research for public bodies and other organisations. He said offshore companies were making huge profits from buying public assets, with annual average returns on their PFI investments as high as 28%. But Mr Whitfield said the companies paid little or no UK corporation tax despite making huge profits. He said: ""PFI is essentially a private sector profit machine. If the government adopted a strategy of building the public infrastructure directly through public investment and operating it through their in-house services this whole edifice would not exist. ""All these transactions are a product of the fact that there is so much money to be made in PFI."" Mr Whitfield said five offshore PFI funds made profits of Â£1.83bn over the five-year period ending in April 2015, but paid little or no corporation tax. However, this was disputed by one offshore PFI giant, HICL Infrastructure Ltd, based in Guernsey. It said Mr Whitfield's research took no account of the fact that tax was paid both by the company's subsidiaries and by shareholders on their dividends. A spokesman said: ""At the project level, HICL invests in a number of companies, which are incorporated in the UK and accordingly taxed by HMRC."" Professor Marcel Levi, chief executive of University College London Hospital Meanwhile, many PFI deals are causing headaches across public services, particularly in the NHS. The University College London Hospital's NHS Foundation Trust (UCLH) told the BBC that its PFI debt was far too high, mainly due to interest rate charges of between 7% and 8%. This meant an annual bill of Â£30m, at least double what he believes UCLH could be paying if the debt was re-scheduled. Professor Marcel Levi, UCLH Chief Executive, told the BBC: ""If we spend an enormous amount of money on paying interest rates and this PFI debt, then that's money we cannot spend on patient care, on nurses, on treatment and management systems."" And it's money that is not being spent on achieving targets for A&E and cancer waiting times, he added.

"An explosion in tourism saved Iceland's economy. But in a country of just 300,000 people, how much tourism is too much? It's a cold, overcast and blustery day in Iceland, but that hasn't put off the busloads of tourists at the Blue Lagoon - one of the country's most popular attractions. The lagoon is a pool of geothermally heated water. It is rich in minerals and is said to be good for your skin. Its creation is something of an accident. Locals noticed the run-off from a local geothermal power plant was a strange shade of blue and started bathing in it. Located between Reykjavik and the airport, it's now become a ""must-do""' on tourist itineraries. ""In our first year in 1994 we had about 50,000 guests, and this year we will be welcoming 1.3 million,"" says Grimur SÃ¦mundsen, the Blue Lagoon's chief executive. That success reflects the astonishing growth of tourism in Iceland as a whole. Last year 1.7 million people visited Iceland - more than triple the number that came in 2010, when the small island nation of just 330,000 was still reeling from a catastrophic banking crisis and the eruption of EyjafjallajÃ¶kull - a volcano that grounded air traffic across Europe for a week. This year 1.3 million tourists will visit the Blue Lagoon, says Grimur SÃ¦mundsen At the time the eruption was seen as a disaster for tourism, but that pessimism proved ill-founded. ""In the long term it had a tremendous positive effect because EyjafjallajÃ¶kull was one of the things that put Iceland on the map."" Mr SÃ¦mundsen says. ""Maybe tourists heard of Iceland for the first time in the various airports when they were stranded."" Listen to Edwin Lane's report on Business Daily, BBC World Service The sudden interest from travellers could not have come at a better time. When Iceland's three major banks collapsed in 2008 at the height of the financial crisis, there were fears they would take the rest of the economy with them. Nine years later the economy is growing at more than 7% a year, unemployment is less than 3% and foreign currency is rolling in. The tourism boom is leading to a construction boom and the creation of tens of thousands of jobs. ""Tourism really helped us take off,"" says Gylfi Magnusson, a professor at University of Iceland and a former minister for economic affairs after the banking crisis. ""Certainly the recovery would have taken considerably longer if it hadn't been for this unexpected boom."" But the sudden influx of foreign visitors has not come without problems. Some sites lack the infrastructure to cope with the rising numbers. ""We don't have any neighbours anymore,"" says Reykjavik resident Benony Aegesson In summer Reykjavik's restaurants are filled to capacity. There is a shortage of hotel rooms, meaning that AirBnB has flourished, and Reykjavik's main shopping streets have been turned into a stream of tourist shops selling Icelandic wool jumpers and soft toy puffins. ""We don't have any neighbours anymore,"" says Benony Aegesson, who has lived in downtown Reykjavik since the 1970s. He says virtually all the flats around his home are now rented out to tourists. ""It was very fashionable for young people to live here, but the prices are getting so high that the young people can't afford it anymore. ""Speculators have come here and bought up apartments and stores and we're worried about its future as a residential area. If it's only old people and tourists here, there is a danger it will die."" Is there a limit to the number of tourists a small nation like Iceland can accommodate? Inga HlÃ­n PÃ¡lsdÃ³ttir is the director of Visit Iceland, and has been in charge of promoting Iceland as a tourist destination for the past decade. She says the question is a difficult one to answer. Areas outside the capital Reykjavik are looking for more travellers to come and visit, says Inga HlÃ­n PÃ¡lsdÃ³ttir ""If you said there would be five million people coming to Iceland in five years and you told me they would all be coming to Reykjavik, i would really worry,"" she tells me. ""But we've been putting the focus on the other regions of Iceland. If you get numbers like that spreading around Iceland, visiting other communities then you have a completely different scenario. ""At this point I don't think we have an overflow - if you talk to someone just outside Reykjavik they're complaining that they want more travellers to come and visit them."" I asked long-time Reykjavik resident Benony Aegesson if he would ask people not to come to Iceland on holiday. ""No, I wouldn't do that,"" he says: ""We're not against tourists per se, but nobody wants to come to a ghost city. Of course they saved us from our financial crisis - that we are grateful for.""

"Until recently, new car sales in Britain were booming.  In 2016, a record 2.7 million were registered. It was the fifth year in succession that the market had grown. Now, things look very different. In September, new registrations fell by 9% compared with the same period the year before, according to the Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). It continued a downward trend that has been visible for the past six months. And this week, Pendragon, one of the country's biggest car dealers, issued a surprise profits warning. It said waning demand for new cars and a consequent fall in the price of older vehicles would take a heavy toll on its earnings. So what's gone wrong? The first thing to say is that car sales are still pretty strong, by historical standards at least.  You can see that from the graph below. In fact, most analysts had expected sales to tail off this year, if not by the levels we've actually seen. That's partly because the market is very cyclical. Once people have a car, they tend to keep it for a number of years, and rapid growth is difficult to sustain. But changes in the market have also had an impact. One of the main factors driving the market has been the growth of so-called Personal Contract Purchase plans, or PCPs, for private buyers. These are essentially leasing agreements, with an option to buy at the end of the contract, typically after three years. PCPs have proved very popular, in part because they allow buyers to obtain new cars while making lower monthly payments than would normally be required under traditional forms of financing, such as hire purchase. They also encourage people to get new cars more often - because at the end of one contract, many people simply take out another. But now that growth is tailing off. ""It's running out of steam now,"" says David Leggett of industry analysts Just-auto. ""The industry has been very adept in getting people on to these schemes, driving them on to three-year replacement cycles. But now, most people who wanted to take out PCPs have done so. ""At the same time, interest rates are going to go up, inflation is rising and household budgets are being squeezed. So a drop-off is to be expected."" Used car sales, meanwhile, have been more resilient. After hitting record levels in the first three months of the year, they fell 0.7% in the second quarter, the most recent period for which figures are available. Anecdotal evidence suggests the brakes may be coming on in this market too. But according to the SMMT, even though new car sales had been expected to fall this year, the decline has been far higher than expected. Tamzen Isacsson, the industry group's director of communications, says there have been two main factors at play. Over the first part of the year, she says, the government put out ""very unclear signals about its air quality plans"", which hampered demand for diesel cars in particular. Diesels have been a key target for air quality campaigners, particularly since the Volkswagen emissions scandal erupted in late 2015. In July, after weeks of speculation, the Department for Environment, Farming and Rural Affairs (Defra) announced thatsales of all new diesel and petrol cars would be banned by 2040. Although the proposed ban doesn't include hybrids and won't come into effect for more than two decades, it does appear to have had an impact on sales. In September, for example, registrations of diesels were down more than 20% compared with last year - continuing a trend seen over several months. Sales of electric cars and hybrids have risen sharply, but not enough to make up for the decline elsewhere. The other major factor, according to the SMMT, is Brexit. Tamzen Isacsson insists it is ""the greatest challenge the industry is facing at the moment"". Consumer confidence, she says, is key to the health of the new car market. ""If consumer confidence is low, people delay purchases of big-ticket items like cars. ""With so much confusion about the impact of Brexit and where the economy is heading, it's not surprising they're holding back. ""It is imperative for the future health of the new car market that we get some clarity on this.""

"Scooter For the past two years, a serial killer has been attacking pet cats in Britain, leaving behind him a trail of fear and mistrust. This story contains details some readers may find distressing Exactly what happened to Chantelle's black-and-white cat, Scooter, is a mystery. The last time she saw her, they were in her kitchen on a warm, still night this summer. Scooter was sitting on a stool watching as Chantelle marched around the house to increase her step count before bed. The next morning, she had disappeared. As Chantelle searched the street outside, a neighbour came over to say he had found Scooter at 1am. She had been lying dead on the pavement outside his house. He thought she could have been hit by a car, even though there was never much traffic in their residential street. He told Chantelle he had gone inside to find a blanket to cover the body. When he returned it had disappeared. He assumed foxes had taken it. But later that day another neighbour approached Chantelle to tell her she had also found Scooter. This time the dead cat had been seen at 5.30am on the neighbour's front lawn. Scooter had been laid out as if she was stretching, except her tail had been removed with a clean cut and she had been sliced open from head to abdomen. Her entrails had been pulled out and laid beside her on the grass. The second neighbour had called the local council to take the body away, so Chantelle didn't see it with her own eyes. But she was was sure of one thing - Scooter's death was not an accident. Chantelle had read stories about a cat killer operating around the M25, a motorway that forms an outer ring road around London. She didn't think her own cats would be in danger in her home in St Leonards-on-Sea, 70 miles away on Britain's south coast. ""I didn't think to lock my cats up at night, but if I had, Scooter would still be alive,"" she says. She and her husband are now thinking about moving to a new house where they can secure the garden to prevent their other cat getting out. ""I've had a couple of miscarriages and that was easier to deal with than this because that was meant to be,"" says Chantelle. ""I've never been jittery in my entire life, and now he's messed up the tranquillity we had."" The person Chantelle thinks is responsible for Scooter's death is a prolific cat killer who has been operating in Britain since 2015. During that time he - and police are sure the killer is a man - has butchered more than 370 animals, mostly pet cats, but also foxes, rabbits and possibly a wild, baby owl. The first reported victims were clustered around Croydon in South London - so the press named him the Croydon Cat Killer. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map Map produced by the BBC data team using Carto. But killings were later reported all around London, prompting a second nickname, the M25 Cat Killer. In fact, his hunting ground has spread even further than this - to the Isle of Wight, Kent, Birmingham, Wirral and Sheffield. In early June, a small group of people gathered in a Quaker meeting hall in Croydon by the side of a busy roundabout. As the traffic hummed and beeped outside, the group listened to a harpist and lit candles on a table adorned with a large photograph of a tabby cat with a white tummy. They were there to commemorate the animal victims - joining together to sing the hymn All Things Bright and Beautiful and to recite poems about grief. ""Love will solve this,"" was the reassurance given by the organiser, a 46-year-old local animal activist with the striking name, Boudicca Rising. Over the past two years, Rising and her partner, 52-year-old Tony Jenkins, have been the central characters in the hunt to catch the cat killer - real-life pet detectives. Originally from South Africa, Rising is a self-described ""mad cat lady"" who has been involved in animal rescue since arriving in Britain in 1994. When she and fellow animal-lover, Tony, became a couple five years ago, they set up their own animal protection charity named after their neighbourhood - the South Norwood Animal Rescue and Liberty, or Snarl. In 2015, as reports filtered in of pet and fox deaths in South London, Boudicca and Tony first wondered whether a gang was responsible. ""The previous work I've done has been around animal crush videos, which is sexually motivated animal torture,"" says Boudicca, referring to the market on the dark web for graphic videos of live animals being crushed to death. ""But as time went on we realised we were probably dealing with a serial killer,"" she says. Boudicca Rising has been investigating the cat killings for several years Boudicca and Tony are now officially collaborating with the Metropolitan Police in Croydon who have set up a special task force named Operation Takahe (the operation name was generated randomly and happens to be the name of a near-extinct, flightless bird in New Zealand). It was Snarl who persuaded the police to get involved, providing details of killings and speaking out at a 2015 Croydon community meeting attended by the then head of the Metropolitan Police, Sir Bernard Hogan Howe. ""I understand some people may scoff at this,"" says the man running the operation, Det Sgt Andy Collin. ""But the loss that owners are feeling is very real."" Snarl now operates a triage service for the police. They urge anyone who has found a body to call them first as they have a checklist to establish which deaths were caused by the killer, and which were caused by road accidents or other acts of cruelty. When a victim is found, they help secure the crime scene, check the animal's microchip and scour the ground for evidence. In some cases, like that of Chantelle's cat Scooter, they arrive too late and the bodies have already been removed by the council. But when they can retrieve remains, Snarl has helped pay for post-mortems to confirm the cats were killed by the same person. ""It's important for us to deal with the cases that are clearly linked,"" says Andy Collin. ""It's quite possible other people have got on the bandwagon - copycats if you like."" The killer has struck in residential areas in secluded paths and alleyways behind terraced houses Snarl's work has helped to build up a picture of the killer's methods. He strikes mainly at night in residential areas, often luring his victims with pet food, crab sticks or raw chicken. He kills them quickly with some sort of blunt force then waits at least half an hour for their blood to coagulate before mutilating their bodies. He has cut off heads, paws and tails as well as sliced victims open. Often no blood trail is left, indicating that the victim is cut up in a different location. He then tends to display the bodies close to where he's hunted them down, sometimes in public spaces such as playgrounds. He's also been known to attack twice in the same area. ""I think there's an element of disbelief,"" says Boudicca of the reaction to the macabre brutality of the attacks. ""There are people out there who would rather believe anything else is happening rather than this."" This disbelief has manifested itself in angry posts on Snarl's Facebook page. Arguments have erupted between those who accuse Snarl of exaggerating the problem, saying the cats have been killed by foxes or in accidents, and those who are angry and want revenge against the killer. ""We have trolls on our page, sniping,"" says Boudicca, who has been accused by some of these hostile visitors of misappropriating funds and lying about the scale of the problem. ""But I think it's helpful to show the anger - I don't want communities withholding it as that won't end well."" But as well as attracting critics, Snarl has also gathered supporters especially around London, where volunteers distribute leaflets. Some of these attended the memorial service in June. ""So many people still don't know there's a cat killer,"" says Julie, who is a regular leafleter. Julie does not want to give her full name, or even say where she lives, as she's afraid she may become a target herself. And she says the unease and distrust in the community is so great that some believe the killer could be hiding in plain sight among them. ""We haven't ruled that out,"" she says. ""We hope not, but we haven't ruled it out."" Serial killers often begin their careers by harming animals. Andy Collin, the police detective, fears it is only a matter of time before the UK cat killer turns his attention to humans. A profile drawn up by the National Crime Agency suggests that the killer's problem with cats stems from a deeper problem with women, or with one woman in particular. ""Cats are targeted because they are associated with the feminine - the killer can't deal with a woman or women who are troubling him,"" says Collin. ""The concern we have is that if it isn't a particular person - who will be at some risk eventually - then at some stage he'll escalate or feel brave enough to move on to vulnerable women and girls, either elderly or very young women."" Collin says that, if caught, the killer will probably be charged with criminal damage, though he's hoping to prosecute for other, more serious offences. ""If an animal is despatched humanely then you haven't necessarily got a cruelty offence,"" says Collin. The charge of outraging public decency could cover the psychological harm inflicted. By his own admission, the detective is ""massively frustrated"" by his inability to catch the killer. The police have been investigating the animal killings since 2016 In August this year, his team released details of a man described as a ""person of interest"" after witnesses chased a man who was seen close to the site of an attack in Caterham, south of London. There was also a second possible sighting in nearby Orpington. He was described as a man in his 40s, with short brown hair, dressed in dark clothing with possible acne scarring to his face, wearing a headlamp or carrying a torch. ""It's promising, but it's not something I would put a lot of money on,"" says Collin. The fact that the majority of attacks have taken place in quiet resident areas hasn't helped him. ""We're always told we live in the most covered CCTV society in the world,"" says Collin. ""But when you go into suburban streets, while there might be cameras, people concentrate them on their own properties."" Nor have there been leads from forensic evidence. It's almost impossible to gather DNA from cat fur, and even if his team managed to collect some, Collin says it wouldn't necessarily be from the killer. He suspects the killer must wear gloves as no skin has been found under the claws of the victims. But even this detail isn't much help. ""If you're out at night, the chances are you'll have on a pair of gloves,"" he says. ""It's not likely you're walking around with a great big banner above your head."" One area where the police have made progress is in drawing up a geographical profile of the crimes. Addiscombe - on the outskirts of Croydon - has been identified as an anchor point from where the offences started. The suburb, like many in which the killer has struck, has a run of secluded paths and alleyways behind its terraced houses, making it easy for someone to enter and leave gardens unnoticed and slip away into the night. The trail leads to Addiscombe, south of London ""There is something about Addiscombe that links quite strongly to our person,"" says Collin. ""It could be a family house from the person's youth, a gran's house, or somewhere they're living now.  Somewhere they've stayed in and feel comfy in, or somewhere they've gone to school."" In September, Britain's first forensic laboratory dedicated to prosecuting crimes against animals announced it would re-examine the bodies of dozens of cats believed to be victims of the killer. The laboratory, based at the University of Surrey, is described as a CSI for animals. ""We're looking at various different elements of this case at the forensic level - work that hasn't been done before,"" says university spokesman Dave Ferguson. The news is welcomed by Naomi, who has allowed the body of her cat Ivy to be stored in a freezer for 15 months in the hope that a re-examination might help bring justice. Ivy Naomi remembers the morning that Ivy failed to come in to her home in Northamptonshire when she was called for food. She immediately searched her neighbourhood on foot, before jumping in her car to conduct a wider sweep. Within minutes, she had found Ivy's decapitated body discarded by the side of a busy road. ""I was very emotional. I couldn't stop crying,"" she says. Although she searched for Ivy's head, she wasn't able to find it. Naomi had to take three weeks off work with depression and anxiety. She says she still struggles with nightmares and interrupted sleep. She now locks in her other cats at night and comes home early from evenings out to make sure they're safe. ""A cat being hit by a car you can accept as an accident,"" she says. ""This is completely different. It's caused so much pain, and a feeling of anger."" Boudicca Rising says she hopes that stories like Naomi's and Chantelle's will help people understand the emotional toll that the killer has inflicted, and perhaps prompt more witnesses to come forward. ""Our problem is that people still think of him as just the Croydon cat killer, even though he's been more widespread for some time,"" she says. ""I hope people realise they need to keep their cats indoors, keep a look out for strange behaviour and report it to the police. ""Most of all I hope that somebody will recognise his characteristics and the places he's killed - and turn him in.""

"The abuse inquiry heard allegations of abuse by Rochdale's former Liberal MP Cyril Smith Over the past three weeks theIndependent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse,externalhas been holding public hearings in its Rochdale investigation. A report of the inquiry's findings will be published next year. The focus of the inquiry was to examine how those in authority handled abuse allegations relating to the Cambridge House hostel, which closed in 1965, and Knowl View residential school, which ceased operating in 1994. What has been revealed during the evidence? A convicted paedophile was found sleeping in school buildings, the inquiry heard Shortly before the inquiry hearings, Rochdale Council apologised for its ""unforgivable"" response to child sexual abuse over the decades. The subsequent evidence showed there had been widespread awareness within the council of the exploitation of young Knowl View residents. Abuse appears to have been ingrained in the school, but concerns reached a peak in the late 1980s and early 1990s when a series of reports by child safety experts were written outlining a series of horrific events. One striking example involved a public toilets in Rochdale to which men from elsewhere in north-west England came in order to sexually abuse boys, including some children from Knowl View. Janet Weeks, a Rochdale child protection policy officer in the early 1990s, told the inquiry her offices actually overlooked the toilets. ""I and other workers became aware that from time to time there would be school-age children"" who could be seen ""sitting on the walls of the ornamental flower beds outside the toilets"". ""If we watched them, which we did, we would notice that they would wait for men to go into the toilets and then they would follow them in, and that became quite a pattern and it became a worrying pattern."" She said police were ""alerted"" and subsequently ""came and stood in our office and watched"". Meetings to discuss the issue took place, but the abuse was never properly investigated. Another example from the same period involved a paedophile called Roderick Hilton, who had been convicted of sexually assaulting a resident in Knowl View but was later able to return to the school and at one stage camped outside in a tent. Stephen Bradshaw, a former Knowl View headmaster, told the inquiry there actually appeared to be official sympathy for Hilton and that ""people were very reluctant"" to put a restraining order on him. ""It did seem that he was a part of the furniture, really,"" Mr Bradshaw recalled. The inquiry also heard about an ""epidemic"" of peer-on-peer abuse at the school, involving children being sexually exploited by other children. Some of those who held positions of authority at the time expressed contrition for what happened. Diana Cavanagh, former head of education at Rochdale Council, said: ""Insofar as my part in these matters has meant some of the former pupils have suffered abuse and subsequent trauma and unhappiness, I am truly sorry."" Richard Farnell accused his chief whip of fabricating a note which claimed he said he knew about abuse allegations at Knowl View But the Labour leader of Rochdale Council in the early 1990s - who is the leader again now - denied knowing about the abuse until more recently. Councillor Richard Farnell blamed other people for not informing him. As a result, Mr Farnell said he was ""not prepared to accept personal responsibility"" for failing to take action. But the inquiry heard that in 2014 Mr Farnell told fellow councillor Peter Joinson that he had once seen a draft of one of the critical child protection reports. A typed note of the conversation written by Mr Joinson - the former Labour chief whip in Rochdale - recorded Mr Farnell saying he had seen the draft in 1992. Denying this, Mr Farnell said his chief whip was lying and the note had been fabricated for political reasons. The statement by Mr Joinson was a ""complete invention in order to try and politically damage me"", Mr Farnell claimed. When asked whether his leader had lied during his evidence to the inquiry, Mr Joinson said: ""I don't like using that word, but I would say he's probably not telling the truth."" This video can not be played Kevin Griffiths was abused at a Rochdale care home as a teenager in the 1960s by Sir Cyril Smith, he alleges Cyril Smith, MP for Rochdale between 1972 and 1992, is accused of sexual abuse at both Cambridge House and Knowl View. He played a central role in the foundation of both institutions. It emerged during the inquiry hearings that Cambridge House had actually been owned by Rochdale Council, which then leased the property back to Smith. The panel also heard evidence that Rochdale Council paid for a number of boys to be placed in the hostel between 1961 and 1965. The hostel itself closed in December 1965 shortly after the first allegations had been made to a new social worker about Smith's activities. The local authority then withdrew boys it had placed there and refused further funding. MI5 was made aware prosecutors lied to the press over the existence of a Cyril Smith child abuse file, the inquiry heard The allegations against Smith have been widely reported in the past, but the inquiry heard unusual new evidence about awareness by MI5 of claims against the late MP. Lancashire Police had investigated Smith while he was still a local politician. Detectives gathered testimony from eight young men - six of them former Cambridge House residents - who accused Smith of sexual abuse. In 1970 a file of evidence was submitted to the then Director of Public Prosecutions, Sir Norman Skelhorn, who replied a mere three days later saying there was not a realistic prospect of conviction. The police had been convinced of their case, but had to inform Smith that he would face no action. Years later, when Smith was seeking re-election at the 1979 general election, journalists from the Rochdale Alternative Paper (RAP) investigated the earlier case. The DPP by that point was Sir Thomas Hetherington, whose office denied knowledge of the 1970 file when approached by the RAP. But previously secret MI5 documents - disclosed to the inquiry - revealed this was untrue. A note written by MI5's legal adviser,externalrecorded that Sir Thomas himself had called the Security Service to say a journalist called David Bartlett ""had telephoned about a gross indecency case involving Cyril Smith and boys"". The note continued: ""After consultations, the DPP's press representative had untruthfully told Bartlett that they had no record of this case. In fact, their file closely accorded with the details given by Bartlett."" A letter from MI5 to the inquiry,externalsaid there were ""limited actions"" it could have taken given its function at the time was defence of the realm.

"The Claim:Security Minister Ben Wallace told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""There is some good news which never gets reported - nine out of 10 of the latest, most serious cyber-crime attacks have resulted in arrest or charges."" Reality Check verdict:The relevant figure is slightly less positive to the one Mr Wallace cited on air. Between October 2016 and May 2017, the National Crime Agency (NCA) and regional organised crime units identified suspects in nine, and made arrests in seven, of the 10 most serious cyber-incidents under investigation. No-one was charged during the relevant period. We all know a burglary when we see one. Smashed window. TV gone. But large numbers of people - and entire organisations - don't necessarily realise when they've been a target or victim of a digital smash-and-grab. That's the public awareness challenge that makes combating the growth of this 21st Century crime so difficult. Put simplest, cyber-crimes and attacks fall into three broad categories: Personal crimes - such as a fraud committed through a bogus online shop or auction - but also bank card cloning and other identity-related scams in which your personal details are taken, sold in online market places and used, ultimately, to steal money. Attacks against organisations - such as this year's huge Wannacry attack which caused major disruption within the NHS. The criminals demanded payment in an untraceable online currency before they would hand back control of computers. Attacks possibly organised by a state against another state's institutions or infrastructure. The alleged involvement of Russian agents in the US president election would be an example of this kind of cyber-attack, if proven to be true. Starting at the bottom and working up, a few years ago the Metropolitan Police estimated that the annual number of online fraud offences nationwide would overtake all types of burglary by, at the latest, autumn 2017. That already looks spot on. In the year to June 2017, the police recorded just over 423,000 burglaries across England and Wales. The Office for National Statistics says there were 653,000 frauds - and all experts in this field think there are many more unreported incidents. Separate experimental data from the Crime Survey for England and Wales, a rolling survey of our experiences, estimates there were 3.3 million frauds in the year to June - and more than half of those were ""cyber-related"". On top of all that, there were an additional 1.6 million incidents of ""computer misuse"", generally meaning hacking or virus attacks. GCHQ is one of the government agencies tasked with tackling cyber-crime If a hacker steals your personal data, that can be used by organised crime gangs to create fake bank cards in your name. Viruses can be used to hold machines to ransom or, without your even knowing about it, turn your PC into a ""zombie"" that becomes part of a global attack on a major institution. And that's where many of these individual crimes fit into a bigger picture. Since it was set up in October 2016, the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) dealt with 590 ""significant"" incidents. The most well-known of these was the Wannacry attack, which prompted the Home Secretary to hold the first ever Cobra meeting (a government emergency response committee) dedicated to a cyber-attack. So what about the response? The Home Office says cyber-crime is a national priority and the NCA plays the lead role in pursuing suspects and building the intelligence picture. It runs some investigations itself and assists others being led by detectives inside the country's regional organised crime units. But individual police forces are also under sustained pressure to up their game. While some have well-developed units, such as the Metropolitan Police's ""Operation Falcon"", others are struggling to recruit because they need detectives with highly specialist skills. One of the major problems is working out who is supposed to be investigating a particular incident because the crime gang behind an attack could be anywhere in the world. It's very difficult to count how many cyber-related criminals have been successfully prosecuted. Many suspects will be charged with fraud or theft offences but there's no breakdown on how many of those were related to online swindles. Only 55 people were convicted of computer misuse offences relating to hacking last year. During his interview Mr Wallace was referring to the NCA's list of the most serious cyber-incidents between October 2016 and May 2017.

The government believes it is, arguing that the NCSC is a world-beating body, backed up by expert investigators in the National Crime Agency, MI5 and GCHQ. But Parliament's Public Accounts Committee said in February that a skills shortage and ""chaotic"" handling of personal data breaches were undermining confidence in the government's ability to protect the UK from cyber-attacks. The MPs said ministers had taken too long to consolidate an ""alphabet soup"" of agencies - although some experts said the report was unfair and failed to take into account the resources now being thrown at this very modern threat.

"This video can not be played Turning breast milk into special mementos The word jewellery conjures up images of precious materials like platinum, rubies, emeralds and diamonds. However, it can also be made from something that is much more precious for babies - breast-milk. Parents across Northern Ireland are using the bespoke pieces to celebrate and commemorate their breastfeeding experiences. Baby Rhys died three months ago Rhys Bramwell was only seven-and-a-half months old when he died from a heart condition. His parents, Kelly and Paul, have kept Rhys' memory close to their hearts by creating special mementoes, including a ring, earrings and a heart-shaped memory stone - all made using Kelly's breast-milk. Kelly's ring has seven breast-milk gems signifying the seven months her son lived ""We were very aware, not of what we were facing, but of how things could go following our 20-week-scan,"" said Kelly. ""Throughout Rhys' short life I was able to breastfeed him, which was so beautiful and remarkable as the doctors didn't think it would be possible. ""In his memory we wanted to create a piece that showed everything that we feel for him and the unending love we have for him."" Kelly and Paul had a special piece made in memory of their son Rhys Kelly added: ""This piece is everything we could have wanted. It means everything. ""It's only because Rhys and I worked so hard together at breastfeeding that we have these pieces."" Kelly's husband Paul also had a special pendant made, which features the front cover of Rhys' favourite bedtime book, with a picture of him on one side, and breast-milk on the other. Paul, Kelly and their three year old son Reuben with a special teddy bear containing baby Rhys' ashes ""It might not be for everyone, but it's a nice keepsake for me to have,"" he said. ""It's around my neck all the time."" Kerry Miles, who has a degree in fine art, makes the bespoke pieces. She said it was a privilege to work with families like the Bramwells. Kerry Miles with her children Daisy, aged 20 months, and Poppy, aged 3 ""Losing a baby is a very sad time, however this is a way to make it into a positive experience,"" she said. ""It's a way that families feel that they still have a piece of their babies, and can keep their memories with them."" She began making her own breast-milk jewellery after her youngest daughter endured a bout of illness when she was breastfeeding. Some people travel to Kerry's house, or choose to send their milk in sealed packages in the post ""I was going through such a tough time that I wanted to make something beautiful out of my experience,"" said Kerry. ""I knew that you could send your milk away to be made into jewellery, but I wanted to do it myself. "" Once the milk is dehydrated it is turned into a powder Some of the pieces Kerry made for herself soon caught the attention of members of her local breastfeeding support group who then wanted their own. ""Breastfeeding can be such a special journey,"" she said. ""Most people want to celebrate that journey, or just kind of say thank you to themselves, or to give to their children in later years, or to have something beautiful to remember their time breastfeeding. Other parents prefer to have keepsake stones made from placenta ""When your baby stops feeding it can be a bit of an emotional wrench, so it helps you to remember that bond for however long it is."" Dr Hanratty, who lectures at Queen's University, is involved in the organisation ofBelfast Breastival,externaland said she had two pendants made to remind her of when her baby was small. Dr Hanratty wearing her 'tree of life' necklace made from breast milk ""When I was pregnant, I always thought breastfeeding was something I would attempt, because my mum had breastfed me and my siblings,"" she said. ""But it's not an easy thing to do, but I was proud that I was able to do it for my little lady. 'Tree of life' jewellery represents the process of breastfeeding between mother and baby ""I wanted to have these pendants made because they reminded me of a time when I was able to provide my baby with the essentials she needed. ""Through the process of breastfeeding my baby, I felt that my boobs became much more mine, as they served a purpose for me and my family,"" she added.

"Tiger entered his plea at the Palm Beach County courthouse in Florida. Tiger Woods has been sentenced to a year's probation after pleading guilty to reckless driving. The professional golfer was arrested in May after officers found him slumped at the wheel of his parked Mercedes-Benz not far from his Florida home. A toxicology report found Woods had several legal medications in his system and marijuana's active ingredient. The 41-year-old golfer, who has 14 major men's golf titles, has not won a major championship since 2008. As part of Friday's plea bargain, he is required to attend a drug treatment programme and undergo drug testing. This video can not be played Mr Woods was also charged with driving under the influence Woods has already completed 50 hours of community service as part of the programme, said a state prosecutor. If he completes the programme, the reckless driving charge will be wiped from his record, said Florida Circuit Judge Sandra Bosso-Pardo during his court hearing. ""This particular plea agreement has no jail time,"" Judge Bosso-Pardo noted during the sentencing. ""However, if you violate your probation in any significant way, I could revoke your probation and sentence you to jail for 90 days."" ""Is that understood?"" she asked. Woods replied: ""Yes."" Police dashcam footage of Woods' 29 May arrest showed the golfer swaying and slurring his words as he interacted with officers near his home in Jupiter, Florida. He later insisted that alcohol was not a factor, which the toxicology test showed to be true. He claimed his disorientated condition was caused by an unexpected reaction to the combination of medications he was taking, following surgery on his back. In 2009 Woods was involved in a bizarre car crash outside his Orlando home. The incident sparked accusations of extramarital affairs which led to the end of his seven-year marriage and the loss of lucrative sponsorship deals.

"Two lorries and a minibus were involved in the crash during the August Bank Holiday weekend Two lorry drivers have denied a string of charges following a crash on the M1 that left eight people dead. Six men and two women died in the crash involving two lorries and a minibus near Newport Pagnell on 26 August. Ryszard Masierak, 31, of Evesham, Worcestershire, and David Wagstaff, 53, of Stoke-on-Trent, each deny eight counts of causing death by dangerous driving.

David Wagstaff (left) and Ryszard Masierak (right) will go on trial next February. Four minibus passengers were also seriously hurt in the crash on the southbound carriageway. Both defendants denied four counts of causing serious injury by dangerous driving. Mr Wagstaff pleaded guilty to eight counts of death by careless driving, and to careless driving. Peter Shaw, prosecuting, said these pleas were not accepted by the Crown. He called for Mr Wagstaff to stand trial on the more serious charge of death by dangerous driving. The eight people who died were part of a group of Catholics from Nottingham's Malayali community, originating from Kerala in southern India. They were on their way to catch the Eurostar to France when the crash happened. The minibus was owned and being driven by Cyriac Joseph The minibus was being driven from Nottingham to London by Cyriac Joseph, 52, a father-of-two, who died in the crash.

"This video can not be played The moment Catalan parliament declared independence The Catalan regional parliament has voted to declare independence from Spain, while the Spanish parliament has approved direct rule over the region. Catalan MPs easily approved the move amid an opposition boycott. Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy had told senators direct rule was needed to return ""law, democracy and stability"" to Catalonia. The crisis began earlier this month when Catalonia held a controversial referendum on independence. Catalonia crisis: What next for Spain? What powers does Catalonia have? The Catalan government said that of the 43% of potential voters who took part, 90% were in favour of independence. But Spain's Constitutional Court had ruled the vote illegal. A motion declaring independence was approved on Friday with 70 in favour, 10 against, and two abstentions in the 135-seat chamber. The measure calls for the transfer of legal powers from Spain to an independent Catalonia. But the Spanish Constitutional Court is likely to declare it illegal, while the US, UK, Germany and France all expressed support for Spanish unity. European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker said the EU ""doesn't need any more cracks, more splits"". Catalan President Carles Puigdemont has called for supporters to ""maintain the momentum"" in a peaceful manner. Crowds have been celebrating the declaration of independence and Spanish flags have been removed from some regional government buildings in Catalonia. By James Reynolds in Barcelona The pro-independence crowd outside the parliament followed the session vote by vote. Some had their mobile phones on speaker, to allow listeners at the other end a taste of the atmosphere. The crowd met every Yes vote with a cheer - and every No with a boo. At the end, there was a huge cheer. The scene outside the Catalan parliament ""We're finally free,"" a woman next to me said, as she began to cry. ""We are oppressed here. We're fighting for our freedom."" But around the corner, away from the demonstration, views were different. ""It's disastrous,"" said one man. ""It's the result of an extended manipulation which does not reflect the will of the Catalan people."" Soon after the vote at the regional parliament, the Senate - Spain's upper house - made the unprecedented step of approving measures allowing the Spanish government to impose direct rule over Catalonia. There were 214 votes in favour and 47 against. The case for and against independence Reality Check: Police violence in Catalonia Urging calm, Mr Rajoy said: ""Spain is a serious country, it is a great nation and we are not prepared in any way to allow some people to liquidate our constitution."" He is holding a cabinet meeting to decide what measures to take. It could include the firing of Catalan leaders, and the Spanish government taking control of the region's finances, police and publicly owned media. After the 1 October referendum, Mr Puigdemont signed a declaration of independence but delayed implementation to allow talks with the Spanish government. A deadline set by Madrid for him to clarify his intentions came and went, prompting Mr Rajoy to announce plans to impose direct rule. Catalonia is one of Spain's richest, most distinctive regions and enjoys a high degree of autonomy. But many Catalans feel they pay more to Madrid than they get back, and there are historical grievances too, in particular Catalonia's treatment under the dictatorship of General Franco. Catalans are divided on the question of independence - an opinion poll earlier this year said 41% were in favour and 49% were opposed to independence. Does Catalonia want to leave Spain?

"Victoria Cilliers told detectives she ""shouldn't have survived"" the fall The wife of an Army sergeant accused of tampering with her parachute said she should have never survived a 4,000ft fall, a court has been told. Victoria Cilliers, 42, suffered multiple injuries in a fall in Wiltshire in April 2015. Emile Cilliers, 37, denies two counts of attempted murder and one of recklessly endangering life. Mrs Cilliers told the court she could not categorically say if it was or was not an accident. But added: ""Never in the history of parachuting worldwide has it happened"". In a three-hour police interview, shown to Winchester Crown Court, the former Army officer spoke of her time in hospital after the near-fatal fall at Netheravon Airfield in which she suffered broken vertebrae, ribs and pelvis. The 42-year-old told detectives she ""shouldn't have survived"" that. ""It's not really a conceivable accident, you can't categorically say it was not an accident, you can't categorically say it was, but never in the history of parachuting worldwide has it happened."" Emile Cilliers denies attempting to murder his wife in April 2015 Prosecutors allege Mr Cilliers, a sergeant with the Aldershot-based Royal Army Physical Training Corps, twisted the lines of her main parachute and sabotaged a reserve chute the day before her jump. Mrs Cilliers told officers how her husband did not visit her very often in the hospital and showed little interest in her. She said: ""I said 'I love you' and he did not reply, which is harsh in that situation, really... harsh."" She also spoke of how he had been ""absolutely livid"" after confronting him about smoking in the car adding it was the ""one time"" she was ""scared"" and had ""never seen that kind of look on someone before"". Mr Cilliers denies two counts of attempted murder and one of damaging a gas valve, recklessly endangering life. The trial was adjourned until Monday. Wife 'blacked out' as parachute failed Parachute case accused 'despised by wife' Parachute trial accused 'caused gas leak' Parachute sabotage accused 'texted lover' Parachute 'sabotage' possible in minutes Accused husband 'skilled parachute packer' Reserve parachute 'had never failed' Parachute 'not tampered with in toilet' Parachute sabotage trial jury visits site Parachute murder bid accused 'unemotional' Jury shown 'tangled parachute' pictures Parachute fail wife 'among UK's best' HM Courts & Tribunals Service Man sought by police after convenience store incident Fire breaks out at secondary school Secondary school confirms it will be closed after fire Photographs show snow fall in New Forest amid yellow weather warning The Cotswolds named as one of best places to live in country New chairman takes on role at charity after day out with Bobby Van At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

"Hotel booking sites are to be probed by the UK's competition watchdog to see if consumers are being misled by them. The Competition and Markets Authority is concerned that rather than helping consumers, the sites might actually be making it more difficult for them. The CMA said it was ""concerned,externalabout the clarity, accuracy and presentation of information on sites"". The investigation will examine areas such as hidden charges, search results, and discount claims. Leading booking sites include Expedia and Booking.com. In a statement, booking site Trivago, which is majority owned by Expedia, said: ""Trivago will work with the CMA to explain the benefits it delivers to consumers looking for their ideal hotel."" Booking.com said it would not be commenting at this time. According to the CMA, about 70% of people who shop around for accommodation use hotel booking sites. Nisha Arora, a senior director at the CMA, told the BBC's Today programme: ""We are concerned about the clarity and accuracy of these sites. Rather than helping consumers they may actually be making it more difficult for them."" She explained that the suggestions offered by such sites were not ranked solely on the preferences entered by the user. ""When you put in your criteria - which room you want, when you want to stay - they are listed in a certain order. This is not just influenced by consumer preference but by commission - commercial considerations - and consumers might not be aware of this."" The British Hospitality Association (BHA) said it welcomed the probe as many of its members were  concerned about the ""vast power"" of online booking agencies. It highlighted ""high rates of commission, use of misleading information, pressure selling, and a lack of transparency"". ""In the process guests are paying more than they should for rooms."" The BHA also said contract terms with some sites often included clauses that stopped a hotel offering a lower price on its own website than that offered to the online travel agent. Simon Calder, travel editor of the Independent, also highlighted commission rates: ""The starting rate is 15%, which means that Â£15 out of every Â£100 stay is being taken by the intermediary. ""Hotels sometimes pay even more commission for increased visibility - i.e. giving the booking site even more in return for a higher profile on search returns."" He says he tends to contact the hotel direct, to see if they will match the online rate and ""perhaps provide a bonus such as a welcome drink or a free breakfast into the bargain"". The CMA has written to companies across the whole sector. It is seeking evidence from both the websites and hotels, and would also like consumers to get in touch with it and share their experiences. It will look into how search results are ranked, and it also wants more information on whether extra charges, such as taxes and booking fees, are clearly displayed. Another area being looked at is the way sites display how many rooms are left, how many people are viewing a particular hotel and messages that claim to state the last time at which a similar room was booked. Ms Arora said the CMA wanted to hear how the sites gathered the information for these claims. The CMA is concerned this is used for ""pressure selling"", creating a ""false impression of room availability or rush customers into making a booking decision"". Social worker Valentin Danciu, from Ipswich, told the BBC that he had used a hotel booking website to reserve an apartment in Germany which was advertised at Â£31 per night. However, when the booking confirmation arrived it also included a â¬22 service charge and a â¬45 cleaning fee. Mr Danciu said he had been using hotel booking sites for years, but this time seemed to have missed the small print. He said until he received the email confirmation he had been given no indication that the total amount would be more than Â£90. The investigation into hotel websitesfollows a year-long CMA probe into price comparison sites. The CMA concluded that price comparison websites worked best for car insurance and worst for broadband.

"Blair is known for Hellboy while McAdams starred in Spotlight Actresses Selma Blair and Rachel McAdams are the latest women to come forward with allegations against film director James Toback. They are among more than 200 women who have made claims about his behaviour. Cruel Intentions star Blairtold Vanity Fair,externalToback sexually assaulted her and then intimidated her into silence, while McAdams said he propositioned her in a hotel room when she was a student. Toback has denied allegations about him originally made in the LA Times. Last Sundaythe newspaper publishedclaims of harassment made by 38 women. Toback denied those original accusations and did not respond when the paperpublished new accounts, which had not been verified. Vanity Fair said he had declined to comment on their article. Toback's films include Black and White, Tyson and The Pick-Up Artist Blair claimed in the article that Toback persuaded her to perform a monologue while she was topless in a hotel room in 1999. She said he then rubbed himself against her leg, then told her: ""There is a girl who went against me. She was going to talk about something I did."" He then allegedly told Blair that the ""girl"" would end up ""in the Hudson River with cement blocks on her feet"" if she ever spoke about what happened. In her account, McAdams said Toback invited her to his hotel room after asking her to audition for a role, and that ""pretty quickly the conversation turned sexual"". ""It was all so confusing,"" she told Vanity Fair. ""I kept thinking, 'When are we getting to the rehearsal part?'"" Toback allegedly went to the bathroom and returned to make a sexual proposition.

There are few authentic portraits of Mary, Queen of Scots and images from her life in Scotland are particularly rare. The painting, completed two years after Mary was accused of plotting to kill Queen Elizabeth I and beheaded, usually hangs in the National Trust's Ham House near London. Elizabeth was still alive at the time, and Mary's son James VI of Scotland did not accede to the English throne as James I until the Union of Crowns 14 years later. David Taylor, curator of pictures and sculpture at the National Trust, said the ""remarkable discovery"" added an ""exciting hidden dimension"" to the painting. He added: ""It shows that portraits of the queen were being copied and presumably displayed in Scotland around the time of her execution, a highly contentious and potentially dangerous thing to be seen doing."" The portrait has distinct similarities to other images of Mary, Queen of Scots made during her lifetime The hidden portrait was discovered by conservator Dr Caroline Rae from the Courtauld Institute of Art, London, who described it as an ""exciting revelation"". She used an X-ray technique that penetrates layers of paint but is stopped by heavy metals such as lead white, which was used to create the image underneath. The sketch is similar to depictions of Mary, Queen of Scots from her later years. The face has a resemblance to paintings of the queen by Nicholas Hilliard and her tilted head with hands at the waist is also similar to other portraits.

"Colman will take over from Foy after The Crown's second series Olivia Colman says Claire Foy will be an ""incredibly hard act to follow"" on The Crown. The star of Broadchurch and The Night Manager takes over the role of Queen Elizabeth II from Foy, who portrays her in the early years of her reign. She said: ""I'm so thrilled to be part of The Crown. I was utterly gripped watching it."" Colman will be in series three and four of the show and is due to be seen in the role from 2019. She paid tribute to her predecessor, saying: ""I think Claire Foy is an absolute genius - she's an incredibly hard act to follow. ""I'm basically going to re-watch every episode and copy her."" Foy was equally complimentary, saying she was ""apoplectic with joy"" when she found out Colman was being lined up for the show. ""I just love her, I admire her so much and the idea that we sort of will be doing the same job but not actually working together is just enough - I'm honoured by that,"" she said. It is yet to be revealed who will play Prince Philip. Former Doctor Who actor Matt Smith is currently starring as the Duke of Edinburgh. He and Foy will soon be seen in the second series of the show, due for release in December. Foy and Smith play the young Elizabeth II and Prince Philip Foy, who has won a Golden Globe for the part, has previously said she was aware she would only be in two series. ""This is the last stint,"" she told The Graham Norton Show. ""It's over, I'm done. ""I always knew it was only going to be two series and then the part would be reincarnated and someone else takes over. That's the nature of the part."" Colman, who won a Golden Globe for The Night Manager and has also appeared in BBC Three's Fleabag, will play the Queen in the years from 1963, when the monarch turned 37. Another actress is expected to take over to play the monarch in later life. Fans were excited by her casting, with one saying it was ""amazing news"". Allow Twitter content?

"President Kennedy was shot dead in Dallas on 22 November 1963 Thousands of previously classified documents relating to the assassination of President John F Kennedy in 1963 have been released by the US government. Since the publication, President Donald Trumphas said he will release all remaining files,externalother than the names and addresses of anyone mentioned who is still living - some of the documents have been withheld at the request of government agencies. As people examine all 2,800 files so far released, here are the most interesting points so far. NB many files contain unverified raw intelligence. In a memo written the day assassin Lee Harvey Oswald was killed,FBI director J Edgar Hoover expressed concern about the spread of conspiracy theories,external. ""The thing I am concerned about is having something issued so that we can convince the public that Oswald is the real assassin,"" he said. A memo from the CIA, based on an intercepted phone call, suggestsOswald spoke with a KGB officer at the Russian embassy,externalin Mexico City. It says that on 28 September 1963 he spoke with Valery Vladimirovich Kostikov, an ""identified KGB officer"" who worked for a department ""responsible for sabotage and assassination"". Oswald later called the embassy and, in ""broken Russian"", asked if there was ""anything new concerning the telegram to Washington"". This video can not be played What will top-secret JFK files tell us about Kennedy's killer? Oswald, who shot and killed President Kennedy, was quickly arrested and charged. But two days later Oswald was shot dead in the basement of the Dallas police department by Jack Ruby, a local nightclub owner. But could more have been done to protect him? One memo reveals the FBI had warned Dallas police of a death threat,externalmade against Oswald. FBI director J Edgar Hoover said: ""We at once notified the chief of police and he assured us Oswald would be given sufficient protection. However, this was not done."" This video can not be played A British nurse was in the Dallas hospital when JFK was shot The idea of a leaderless United States did not appeal to some Soviet officials. They ""were fearful that without leadership, some irresponsible general in the United States might launch a missile at the Soviet Union"", according to one memo. It also says the Soviets were ""convinced the assassination was not the deed of one man"",externalbut rather a ""carefully planned campaign in which several people played a part"". The FBI warned the president's brother, US Attorney General Robert F Kennedy, his alleged affair with Marilyn Monroe would be exposed in a book. A letter on 7 July 1964 from the bureau to the younger Kennedy said the paperback, The Strange Death of Marilyn Monroe, would allege he had ""an intimate relationship with Miss Monroe"". Monroe died at the age of 36 in Los Angeles in 1962 According to the FBI, the author would suggest the film star ""was led to believe his intentions were serious"" and that RFK had promised to divorce his wife and marry the sex symbol. But when he refused to do so, Monroe ""threatened to expose their relationship"" and ruin his presidential ambitions. The FBI said the book would allege that RFK took ""drastic action"" by plotting to have Monroe killed and make it look like a suicide. The letter advised RFK the book would also allege he was at her apartment on the night of her death. Agents wrote that RFK ""was actually in San Francisco with his wife at the time Marilyn Monroe committed suicide"". The actress died at the age of 36 in Los Angeles in August 1962 from a barbiturate overdose, according to the city coroner's office. An FBI memo from before Kennedy was elected president describesattempts by a private detective to spy on the then senator,external. It says a ""high priced Hollywood call girl"" told FBI agents that private detective Fred Otash had contacted her to ask about Senator Kennedy's involvement in ""sex parties"". The private detective also suggested equipping the woman with ""a recording device"" to take down any ""indiscreet statements"" from Senator Kennedy. She refused, and said she was unaware of any ""indiscretions"". One memo describes how a British local newspaper, the Cambridge News, received an anonymous call about ""some big news"" in the US, just 25 minutes before the assassination. ""The caller said only that the Cambridge News reporter should call the American embassy in London for some big news and then hung up"", it says. A copy of the memo was released by the National Archives,externalin the US in July, but had gone unreported. One document reveals an operation to assassinate top Cuban leaders,externaland offers of up to $100,000 for ""killing or delivering alive"" government officials. But for Fidel Castro the payment offered was of only $0.02. Fidel Castro moments after he toppled Fulgencio Batista in January 1959 Another document, however, suggests that the price for killing Castro was $150,000 and that there were alleged contacts between Cuban exiles and the mafia. Government ideas about how to kill Castro included contaminating Mr Castro's diving suit with disease-causing bacteria or poisoning his food. An FBI report alleges that President Lyndon B Johnson, who took office after President Kennedy was killed, may have been a member of the KKK. An informant said the white supremacist group had ""documentedproof that President Johnson was formerly a member of the Klan in Texas,externalduring the early days of his political career"". However, no proof was provided.

"Six parties are represented in the Catalan parliament Parliament in Catalonia has declared independence while the Spanish senate has approved a government proposal to reassert control over the region after its disputed independence referendum. The Spanish government wants to dismiss the Catalan government and president, and put its national media company and police force under the control of Madrid. Spain is divided into 17 regions, each with directly elected authorities. Catalonia, in the north-east of the country, has one of the greatest levels of self-government in Spain. It has its own parliament, government and president, police force and public broadcaster. Catalans havea range of powers,externalin many policy areas from culture and environment to communications, transportation, commerce and public safety. Cases for and against independence Catalan crisis in 300 words Foreign affairs, the armed forces and fiscal policy are the sole responsibility of the Spanish government. The division of powers between the central government in Madrid and the regional government in Barcelona is not as clear-cut as it is in some other countries with devolved authorities such as Germany or the UK. In the UK, for example, the government in Westminster cannot interfere in Scottish education policy because education is fully devolved. But in Spain, the Spanish constitution takes precedence if there is a clash with any region - something that the Catalan government resents. Carles Puigdemontassumed the office of President of Catalonia in January 2016. He leads the Catalan government. The vice-president, Oriol Junqueras, is also economics minister. There are 12 ministers, with portfolios including education, health, culture, home affairs and welfare. The Catalan government employs 28,677 people, comprising civil servants and other staff. The Catalan police force employs thousands Catalonia has its own police force, theMossos d'Esquadra,external. The force employs just over 17,000 people, including police officers and back-office staff. They are in charge of public safety and order, and criminal investigations. Spanish national police, under the direct command of the Spanish interior ministry, are also permanently deployed in Catalonia, working on counter-terrorism, immigration and other issues. The Catalan Media Corporation (CCMA) is the public broadcaster of Catalonia. It employs 2,319 people across five television channels, four radio stations and other supporting services. Six parties are represented in Catalonia's 135-seatregional parliament,external. Three of them are pro-independence. Elections were held on 27 September 2015 and ""Together for Yes"" (JxSÃ­), a coalition of two parties and civic organisations, focused on achieving independence from Spain, won the largest number of seats - 62. It was short of an absolute majority and required support from the pro-independence, anti-capitalist Popular Unity Candidacy (CUP), with 10 seats, to form the government. The second largest party in the parliament, with 25 seats, is the liberal anti-nationalist Citizens-Party of the Citizenry (Cs). The Socialists' Party of Catalonia (PSC-PSOE), with 16 seats, and the People's Party of Catalonia (PPC), the Catalan affiliate of Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy's People's Party, with 11 seats, also oppose independence. Catalonia Yes We Can (CSQP), a left wing-green coalition, which won 11 seats, is in favour of self-determination for the Catalan people.

"Two lorries and a minibus were involved in the crash during the August Bank Holiday weekend Two lorry drivers have denied a string of charges following a crash on the M1 that left eight people dead. Six men and two women died in the crash involving two lorries and a minibus near Newport Pagnell on 26 August. Ryszard Masierak, 31, of Evesham, Worcestershire, and David Wagstaff, 53, of Stoke-on-Trent, each deny eight counts of causing death by dangerous driving. A trial has been set for 26 February at Aylesbury Crown Court. Mr Masierak was remanded in custody, while Mr Wagstaff was given bail. David Wagstaff (left) and Ryszard Masierak (right) will go on trial next February. Four minibus passengers were also seriously hurt in the crash on the southbound carriageway. Both defendants denied four counts of causing serious injury by dangerous driving. Mr Wagstaff pleaded guilty to eight counts of death by careless driving, and to careless driving. Peter Shaw, prosecuting, said these pleas were not accepted by the Crown. He called for Mr Wagstaff to stand trial on the more serious charge of death by dangerous driving. The eight people who died were part of a group of Catholics from Nottingham's Malayali community, originating from Kerala in southern India. They were on their way to catch the Eurostar to France when the crash happened. The minibus was owned and being driven by Cyriac Joseph The minibus was being driven from Nottingham to London by Cyriac Joseph, 52, a father-of-two, who died in the crash.

"This video can not be played The moment Catalan parliament declared independence The Catalan regional parliament has voted to declare independence from Spain, while the Spanish parliament has approved direct rule over the region. Catalan MPs easily approved the move amid an opposition boycott. Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy had told senators direct rule was needed to return ""law, democracy and stability"" to Catalonia. The crisis began earlier this month when Catalonia held a controversial referendum on independence. Catalonia crisis: What next for Spain? What powers does Catalonia have? The Catalan government said that of the 43% of potential voters who took part, 90% were in favour of independence. But Spain's Constitutional Court had ruled the vote illegal. A motion declaring independence was approved on Friday with 70 in favour, 10 against, and two abstentions in the 135-seat chamber. The measure calls for the transfer of legal powers from Spain to an independent Catalonia. But the Spanish Constitutional Court is likely to declare it illegal, while the US, UK, Germany and France all expressed support for Spanish unity. European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker said the EU ""doesn't need any more cracks, more splits"". Catalan President Carles Puigdemont has called for supporters to ""maintain the momentum"" in a peaceful manner. Crowds have been celebrating the declaration of independence and Spanish flags have been removed from some regional government buildings in Catalonia. By James Reynolds in Barcelona The pro-independence crowd outside the parliament followed the session vote by vote. Some had their mobile phones on speaker, to allow listeners at the other end a taste of the atmosphere. The crowd met every Yes vote with a cheer - and every No with a boo. At the end, there was a huge cheer. The scene outside the Catalan parliament ""We're finally free,"" a woman next to me said, as she began to cry. ""We are oppressed here. We're fighting for our freedom."" But around the corner, away from the demonstration, views were different. ""It's disastrous,"" said one man. ""It's the result of an extended manipulation which does not reflect the will of the Catalan people."" Soon after the vote at the regional parliament, the Senate - Spain's upper house - made the unprecedented step of approving measures allowing the Spanish government to impose direct rule over Catalonia. There were 214 votes in favour and 47 against. The case for and against independence Reality Check: Police violence in Catalonia Urging calm, Mr Rajoy said: ""Spain is a serious country, it is a great nation and we are not prepared in any way to allow some people to liquidate our constitution."" He is holding a cabinet meeting to decide what measures to take. It could include the firing of Catalan leaders, and the Spanish government taking control of the region's finances, police and publicly owned media. After the 1 October referendum, Mr Puigdemont signed a declaration of independence but delayed implementation to allow talks with the Spanish government. A deadline set by Madrid for him to clarify his intentions came and went, prompting Mr Rajoy to announce plans to impose direct rule. Catalonia is one of Spain's richest, most distinctive regions and enjoys a high degree of autonomy. But many Catalans feel they pay more to Madrid than they get back, and there are historical grievances too, in particular Catalonia's treatment under the dictatorship of General Franco. Catalans are divided on the question of independence - an opinion poll earlier this year said 41% were in favour and 49% were opposed to independence. Does Catalonia want to leave Spain?

"This video can not be played No alternative to direct rule - Rajoy Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has called on senators to approve direct rule over Catalonia, amid an escalating crisis over the region's push for independence. He said he wanted to dismiss Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont, his vice-president and all regional ministers. Meanwhile the Catalan regional parliament is holding a vote on unilaterally declaring independence. Earlier this month Catalonia held a disputed referendum on the issue. Mr Rajoy said he was calling for exceptional measures because there was no other choice and said ""law, democracy and stability"" needed to be returned to Catalonia. He accused the Catalan government of dividing families and fracturing society. Many people had already suffered too much, he said, and the uncertainty was driving businesses out of the region. What powers does Catalonia have? The case for and against independence Reality Check: Police violence in Catalonia ""The thing that Catalans need protecting from is not what they're calling Spanish imperialism, but a minority who, in an intolerant way, declare themselves the owners of Catalonia and consider as exclusive a history, culture and feelings that are the heritage of the community,"" he said. The speech was met with applause in the Spanish Senate, where Mr Rajoy's Partido Popular has a majority. Article 155 of the Spanish constitution empowers the government to take ""all measures necessary to compel"" a region in case of a crisis. It would enable Madrid to take control of Catalonia's finances, police and public media. This video can not be played Students with Catalan flags chanted ""independence"" The Senate is expected to back his proposals, which also have the support of opposition parties. The Catalan parliament could respond by declaring independence unilaterally. However both bodies have allowed for further debate on Saturday. The regional parliament in Barcelona is voting in a secret ballot on declaring independence from Spain after a heated debate. On Thursday Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont failed to reveal a favoured course of action, and called on MPs to decide on a response. Pro-independence MPs have drafted a motion in favour of declaring independence from Spain. But Carlos Carrizosa from the anti-independence Citizens's Party, who was first to speak in Friday's session, said the text would ""destroy what we hold most sacred, living together in harmony"". Pro-union parties are boycotting the vote. Mr Puigdemont signed a declaration of independence following the 1 October referendum, but immediately halted implementation and called for negotiations between Catalonia and the Spanish government. The Catalan government said that of the 43% who took part in the referendum, 90% were in favour of independence. But the Constitutional Court ruled it was illegal. Were reports of Catalan violence fake?

"The women - and their dogs - survived thanks to a water purifier and a store of dry food Two US yachtswomen and their two dogs have been rescued by the US Navy after spending nearly five months adrift in the Pacific Ocean, officials say. Jennifer Appel and Tasha Fuiaba say they set off in a small sailing boat from Hawaii bound for Tahiti when their engine, damaged by bad weather, failed. Their boat then drifted in the open seas about 1,500km (930 miles) southeast of Japan, they said. They were rescued after a fishing vessel alerted US authorities. The pair said they set off in May and their engine broke at the end of that month. They originally thought they would be able to reach land by relying on wind and sails, the US Navy's Seventh fleet said in a statement. ""Two months into their journey and long past when they originally estimated they would reach Tahiti, they began to issue distress calls,"" the statement added. The US Navy said the two women continued with the calls daily, but that their signals were not picked up because they ""were not close enough to other vessels or shore stations"". Ms Appel said they issued distress signals daily for nearly 100 days but received no response. ""It was very depressing and very hopeless, but it's the only thing you can do, so you do what you can do,"" she said. The women had set off from Hawaii with their dogs in May Jennifer Appel is welcomed on board the USS Ashland by Command Master Chief Gary Wise But on 24 October, a Taiwanese fishing vessel spotted their 50ft (15m) boat called the Sea Nymph bobbing in the ocean and contacted authorities on the US territory of Guam. The USS Ashland, which was in the area, arrived early the following day to rescue the sailors - both from Honolulu - and their canine companions Valentine and Zeus. They said they managed to survive the ordeal thanks to a water purifier and more than a year's worth of dry goods such as oatmeal and pasta. In a conference call with reporters while onboard the Navy ship, they described feeling like ""sharkbait"" and wondering if each day would be their last. ""We had survived two different shark attacks and with both of them we thought it was lights out, and they were horrific,"" said Ms Appel, claiming that a group of seven 30ft-long sharks slapped their tails on the hull of the ship one night. ""They saved our lives,"" Ms Appel said of the US Navy. ""The pride and smiles we had when we saw them on the horizon was pure relief.""

"The president and first lady were in Dallas when the assassination happened A British local newspaper received an anonymous call about ""some big news"" in the US, shortly before President John F Kennedy was assassinated, according to documents. A memo dated 26 November 1963 said the call was made to the Cambridge News at 18:05 GMT on 22 November 1963. This was 25 minutes before Kennedy was shot in Dallas, Texas. A copy of the memo was released by the National Archives in the US in July, but had gone unreported. It was revealed again when thelatest batch of documentsrelating to the assassination were released on Thursday. This video can not be played A memo has revealed a call was made to a UK newspaper before John F Kennedy was shot dead President Kennedy was shot as he rode in a presidential motorcade in Dealey Plaza at 12:30 Central Standard Time, which is six hours behind Greenwich Mean Time. The document, from the deputy director of the CIA James Angleton to the FBI director, J Edgar Hoover, said the British Security Service (MI5) had reported that the call was made to the senior reporter of the newspaper. The memo read: ""The caller said only that the Cambridge News reporter should call the American Embassy in London for some big news and then hung up. ""After the word of the President's death was received the reporter informed the Cambridge police of the anonymous call and the police informed MI5. ""The important point is that the call was made, according to MI5 calculations, about 25 minutes before the President was shot. ""The Cambridge reporter had never received a call of this kind before, and MI5 state that he is known to them as a sound and loyal person with no security record."" The life and death of JFK (r) continues to fascinate more than half a century later The memo added that similar anonymous phone calls ""of a strangely coincidental nature"" had been received by people in the UK over the past year, ""particularly in connection with the case of Dr Ward"" - potentially a reference to Dr Stephen Ward, one of the central figures in theProfumo affair,external. Current staff at the Cambridge News said they did not know who took the call, but they were speaking to people who worked there in the 1960s to find out. Reporter Anna Savva said hearing about it was ""completely jaw-dropping"". ""It would have been common knowledge in the office who took the call, but we have nothing in our archive - we have nobody here who knows the name of the person who took the call,"" she said. In a video posted on thenewspaper's website,external, chief reporter Chris Elliott, said ""no one has ever been able to establish whether that call was actually made"" but the fact that it might have been made came to light in the 1980s. ""A London solicitor, Michael Eddowes, started to investigate a document he found allegedly from the CIA,"" he said. ""In that document it was mentioned a call had been made to the Cambridge News warning that something big was going to happen... ""We don't know whether that call was ever made, we don't know which reporter took the call and we don't know what the reason possibly could have been for anyone ringing a newspaper in Cambridge about it."" Mr Elliott said Mr Eddowes, who died in 1992, was ""convinced there was some kind of conspiracy"" and the call might have been one of a number made to newspapers and other media to try to foster the idea that there was a conspiracy to kill the president.

"The UK's top civil servant, Sir Jeremy Heywood, has been receiving treatment for cancer. The Cabinet Office said Sir Jeremy, who has been cabinet secretary since 2012, was diagnosed in June. In a statement, it said the 55-year old had received treatment over the summer and the early autumn which ""went well"". Sir Jeremy, it added, had continued his ""normal duties"" during this period with the full support of his doctors and remained ""totally focused"" on doing so. As cabinet secretary and head of the civil service, Sir Jeremy is responsible for advising the prime minister and cabinet on the business of government, including the UK's withdrawal from the EU. The Cabinet Office said it would be making no further comment on ""this private matter"". Sir Jeremy, who is sometimes characterised in the media as the most powerful figure in the British government, has worked closely with four prime ministers during a 25-year career in Whitehall.

"This video can not be played Barnaby Joyce: 'I was born just there' Australian Deputy PM Barnaby Joyce and four other politicians were wrongly elected because they held dual citizenship, a court has ruled. The High Court of Australia decision means three of the politicians, including Mr Joyce, are disqualified from office. The others quit in July. Australia's constitution prohibits dual citizens from being elected. Mr Joyce's exit puts pressure on the government, which only had a one-seat majority when he was in office. He could return through a by-election. The deputy prime minister, who renounced New Zealand citizenship in August, has pledged to re-contest his lower house seat. ""I respect the verdict of the court,"" Mr Joyce said immediately after the verdict. ""We live in a marvellous democracy, with all the checks and balances they have given us all the freedoms we see. I thank the court [for] their deliberations."" Who are Australia's dual citizen MPs? The other four politicians - Fiona Nash, Malcolm Roberts, Larissa Waters and Scott Ludlam - had been elected to the Senate. (Clockwise from top left) Larissa Waters, Scott Ludlam, Fiona Nash and Malcolm Roberts Another two politicians under scrutiny, senators Matt Canavan and Nick Xenophon, were ruled to have been validly elected. The dual citizenship saga has captivated Australian politics since July, prompting dozens of MPs to publicly clarify their status. During three days of hearings,the government told the courtthat only Mr Roberts and Mr Ludlam should be disqualified,arguing the others did not knowabout their dual citizenship when they were elected last year. Mr Roberts claimed he had tried to revoke his citizenship. Mr Ludlam and Ms Waters,the only MPs to resign over the saga, did not offer a defence - arguing all seven should be ineligible. The seven-judge bench deliberated for two weeks before ruling that five politicians were ineligible as a ""subject or citizen of a foreign power"", under to the constitution'ssection 44(i),external. The court ruled that Mr Canavan and Mr Xenophon were not dual citizens, according to the constitutional definition. The court was not satisfied that Mr Canavan had attained Italian citizenship through descent, while Mr Xenophon's class of inherited UK citizenship did not give him full rights and privileges. With Mr Joyce disqualified, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull's numbers slip to 75 in the 150-seat House of Representatives. However, Mr Turnbull could regain his 76-seat majority if Mr Joyce wins the by-election on 2 December. Mr Joyce is eligible to run now he is a citizen of Australia alone. Mr Turnbull has reshuffled his cabinet because both Mr Joyce and Ms Nash held ministerial portfolios. How a dual citizen crisis befell Australia Jay Savage, BBC Australia Online editor This ruling ends months of confusion about what some had described as an out-of-date, if not odd, quirk of Australia's 1901 constitution. But that clarity brings only fresh uncertainty for Mr Turnbull. The prime minister had repeatedly expressed confidence that all three of his coalition members would be absolved by the court. Now he faces a parliament where he is more likely to lose votes, and confront greater tactical manoeuvring - at least for the time being. Most experts believe it is likely that Mr Joyce will win a by-election in his New South Wales seat, possibly with an increased margin. However, victory is not assured and Mr Joyce could face many rivals. Will such intense national scrutiny affect the vote? A loss would be a blow for Mr Turnbull, who is already facing several political headaches, including heated debates overlegalising same-sex marriageandrecognition of indigenous Australians. Mr Turnbull said he was disappointed in the court's decision, but stressed that his government still had six more MPs than Labor's 69. ""The decision of the court today is clearly not the outcome we were hoping for but the business of government goes on,"" he said. Labor criticised Mr Turnbull for not immediately suspending Mr Joyce and Ms Nash after they referred themselves to the court in August. Deputy leader Tanya Plibersek vowed to scrutinise decisions the pair had made. Their seats will not go to a by-election. Instead, each disqualified senator will be replaced by a member of their own party, or coalition partner, in a recount of votes from the July 2016 election. Despite being ruled eligible,Mr Xenophon said earlier this month that he would resignregardless of the verdict to run for South Australia's state legislature. Ms Waters has already signalled her intention to contest the next general election. Ms Waters first to breastfeed in Senate The Labor opposition has claimed that decisions made by Mr Joyce and Ms Nash since last year are ""under a cloud"" and could face a legal challenge. However, legal experts told the BBC that challenges would be unlikely to succeed, because they could potentially disadvantage the public. Prof Anne Twomey, from the University of Sydney, said the law would protect Australians who relied ""in good faith on the apparent authority"" of ministers to make decisions. However, any decisions made since August - when the ministers learned of their dual citizenship - could be less secure, the experts said. Who are Australia's dual citizen MPs?

Even before this move, separatists had condemned the actions of the Spanish government and police during an outlawed independence referendum on 1 October. Some called those actions repressive - a sentiment expressed most clearly ina video produced by the Catalan cultural organisation Omnium Cultural,external. It's been viewed more than a million times. One of the most striking claims in the video was that police subjected Catalan voters to ""a degree of force never seen before in a European member state"". After Spain's constitutional court declared the poll illegal, police officers were authorised to stop it going ahead. They prevented some people from voting, and seized ballot papers and boxes at polling stations. Speaking to the BBC on Sunday, Spain's foreign minister Alfonso Dastis, claimed images of police violence were ""fake"". Who is correct? This video can not be played Many pictures showing Spanish police acting violently during the referendum were fake - Spanish foreign minister It is true that fake photos have been used but virtually all of the media coverage showing police violence was real - including all of that shown by the BBC. Photos which are six years old have been shared online purporting to show violence in Catalonia on 1 October. For example, this photo was shared in a manner that suggested a disabled Catalan voter was being hit with a baton. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Just because some of the photos were fakes doesn't mean that all or even many of them were. Reality Check has spoken to journalists who witnessed police shoving people, grabbing them by the hair and throwing them down stairs. Andphotojournalists saw police firing rubber bullets,external, Indeed, the Spanish Government accepts there was some violence - andhas apologisedfor it. When protesters tried to stop police officers removing ballot boxes, they were dragged out of the way. So there was police violence on 1 October. Was it the worst ever seen in an EU member state? Some of the early reports of injuries were exaggerated. One woman had claimed that police had intentionally broken her fingers. In reality, her fingers weren't broken, just inflamed - as she explained to the Catalan state broadcaster TV3 after she'd received treatment. On 20 October, the Catalan department of health released revised figures of the number of people who had sought medical treatment because of police action on polling day. These figures were gathered by the various hospitals, clinics and paramedics who treated them. They say 1,066 people sought medical treatment, 991 on the day and 75 in the days that followed. Most people - 886 - were classed as having only a minor injury or condition. Five were considered to be seriously injured. These figures are from the Department of Health, which is a branch of the Catalan government. We have no way of independently verifying whether all 1,066 injuries were caused by police officers. This is the only data available, and has been used in arguments by both sides of the independence debate. SOURCE: Catalan Department of Health Earlier totals had been disputed by Spanish ministers and newspapers - arguing that people might turn up at a clinic despite having no medical complaint. However, the Catalan health service insists everyone included in these latest figures received a diagnosis from a medical professional. Twelve police officers were also injured on polling day. This figure is agreed by both the Catalan department of health and the Spanish government. It is difficult to find examples where as many civilians were injured during clashes with police. Yet when assessing the level of violence, the degree of force is important, not just the number of injuries. Police used tear gas to disperse anti-austerity protesters in Athens in 2012. There are various cases where police in EU member states used an equivalent or even higher degree of force in public. Here are some recent examples: A man died last yearwhen police in Belfast used CS spray during a violent incident in the city centre German police in Hamburg used water cannonto disperse protesters at this summer's G20 summit. 270 were treated for injuries - and 20 of those were treated as inpatients. Dozens of protesters were injured in Athenswhen police used tear gas after anti-austerity protests turned violent in 2012. Portuguese policebeat a man in front of his young childrenoutside a football stadium in 2015. Two hundred were injured in Genoa, Italy,externalafter police beat protesters at the G8 summit in 2001. It is worth noting that none of those events were votes.

"This video can not be played Clive Sullivan led Great Britain to rugby victory in 1972 It is 45 years since Clive Sullivan led the nation to Rugby League World Cup victory. On the day the 2017 tournament kicks off, BBC News looks at how as captain of Great Britain he helped break down barriers. When the 18-year-old Welsh winger joined Hull FC in 1961, there were very few black men in prominent sporting positions. But scoring a hat-trick in a trial game with the team certainly put Sullivan on the map and he signed a contract the following day. So began a career that 11 years later, in 1972, would see him raise the Rugby League World Cup trophy as Great Britain captain - the last occasion the trophy was won by any nation other than Australia or New Zealand. Clive Sullivan won the Challenge Cup with Hull KR (left) in 1980 and Hull FC (right) in 1982 ""Sullivan's appointment [as captain] was extraordinary for the time,"" said Martin Polley, director of the International Centre for Sports History and Culture at De Montfort University. ""A few professional football teams had black players by this time, like Clyde Best at West Ham. ""But the England football team were six years away from even picking a black player for the senior team. ""There were some exceptions in boxing and cricket, but not many had made it through."" James Oddy, author of a new biography on Sullivan, described him as a ""pioneer in the social history of British sport"". ""Clive did a lot for how society judged black athletes, he blazed a trail. ""One of his heroes was Muhammad Ali and perhaps that meant he was more aware than you might have thought about his role. ""Above all, he was a true professional."" Sullivan's talents as a try-scorer saw him play for several teams Yet Sullivan's success did not bring national attention. After the team won the World Cup in France, it was a low-key return. With Â£50 in his pocket for winning the tournament - about Â£600 in today's money - he went back to work at an aircraft factory in Brough, though he did take the trophy in for workmates to see. ""When Clive came home with the team there were no reporters waiting at the airport to greet them,"" remembered his wife, Rosalyn Sullivan. ""They slipped back into normal lives."" The team's return was something of a ""damp squib"", according to Mr Oddy. But the absence of the red-carpet treatment might be down to the fact most rugby league players at the time were ""just ordinary working men"". They played professionally on a part-time basis and worked alongside training and playing. Sullivan himself worked in several factories, a building society and managed a sports trophy shop. Sullivan played professionally part-time while working in factories His impact on the sport, however, would be lasting - breaking down barriers in rugby league and in his adopted city of Hull where he had an impact on the ""colour thing"", Mrs Sullivan said. She said when racism was directed at the young couple, they dismissed it as ignorance and ""the way of the world"". ""Comments were made behind our backs but Clive dealt with it in his own way. ""He was very comfortable in his own skin and was very proud of being black and being Welsh. ""He [made] people understand he was just a person like anyone else. He was very humble."" Johnny Whitely, who made more than 400 appearances for Hull FC, credits Sullivan with unifying a city split by the river and its two rugby league sides. ""He would have been a modern sporting superstar, I am sure of it,"" he said. ""Being black he would also perhaps have had that much publicity as a role model too, as he had such a gentlemanly attitude in life."" Henderson Gill said Sullivan paved the way for players like him Sullivan, who played with distinction for both Hull FC and Hull KR, also had an influence on the next generation of black rugby league players. Henderson Gill, who played rugby league for Wigan and Great Britain during the 1980s, described Sullivan as the ""son of Hull"". ""Clive was one of the guys that paved the way for players like me. He was one of my heroes."" During Sullivan's 20-year career, a growing number of black role models also started to feature in other sports, including John Conteh and Neville Mead in boxing, Sonia Lannaman and Tessa Sanderson in athletics, and numerous football players at West Bromwich Albion, said Prof Polley. ""On the down side, there was also more blatant racism - manifested most obviously in terrace chants and banana-throwing at some football grounds,"" he added. Of course discrimination has long been part of sporting life, said Dr Katy Sian, lecturer in sociology at the University of York. During Sullivan's career, perhaps the most high-profile stand against discrimination was staged by the US athletes Tommie Smith and John Carlos with their ""Black Power"" salute at the medal ceremony for the men's 200m at the 1968 Mexico Olympics. Black athletes at the 1968 Mexico Olympics raised a gloved fist in a silent protest ""It is often said that politics and sport shouldn't be mixed,"" Dr Sian said, but examples such as this ""show us the politicised nature of sport"". ""This form of resistance continues today, for exampleNFL players campaigning to ""take a knee"". ""[But] outshining in a sport can be another key way to disrupt the wider politics of racism, by bringing into question ideas about nation, identity and belonging. ""Think of Mo Farah, Usain Bolt and Muhammad Ali - that is incredibly inspiring for people of colour to see sports players rising to the top."" Sullivan was not a household name in the way his successors have become. But he was not entirely ignored by the establishment. He was appointed MBE for services to rugby league and even featured on the high-rating TV series This is Your Life after the 1972 World Cup victory. In 1980, he won the Challenge Cup with Hull KR, then again with Hull FC in 1982, finally retiring in 1985 to take over a social club with his wife. One of the main roads into Hull was named after the rugby player But within months he was diagnosed with liver cancer and he died in October the same year, aged 42. At his funeral, crowds lined the streets outside Hull Minster and thousands of pounds were raised for cancer research in his name, Mr Oddy said. In his honour, the main road into Hull from the west was named Clive Sullivan Way and the sign bearing his name is still one of the first things visitors see on the approach to the city. ""I don't think he appreciated how good he was. People liked him as a person not just a rugby player,"" his wife said. ""I'm sad he did so much and yet never really made a really good living from the game - it was all done for love."" Born 9 April 1943 in Splott, Cardiff - died 8 October 1985 in Hull Played 17 times for Great Britain, captaining the world cup-winning team in 1972, and 15 times for Wales Played in three world cup finals For Hull FC: A try-scoring record of 250 tries in 352 appearances including seven tries in one game v Doncaster in 1968 For Hull Kingston Rovers: He scored 118 tries in 213 matches The only man to score a century of tries for both clubs Won the Challenge Cup with Hull KR in 1980 and Hull FC in 1982 Also played for Oldham and Doncaster Rugby League - BBC Sport Hull FC Hull KR Rugby League Black History Month 2017 Rugby League World Cup At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

"The half-term holiday is almost over and, for many students in their final year of school, university applications are high on the agenda. So, you've chosen your preferred courses and universities and started to fill in your personal details, education, qualifications and details of any paid jobs. So far, so straightforward - but here comes the awkward bit: The personal statement, required from everyone applying to university through the Ucas admissions service, is a major source of angst. Personal statements are written, rewritten, scrutinised by parents and teachers and rewritten again, taking up at least as much time and effort as any other piece of work this term. ""It's your chance to describe your ambitions, skills and experience,"" saysUcas on its website,external. ""Try to stand out but be careful with humour, quotes or anything unusual - just in case the admissions tutor doesn't have the same sense of humour as you. ""Proofread aloud and get your teachers, advisers, and family to check - then redraft until you're happy with it and the grammar, spelling and punctuation are correct."" Use plain English and avoidhackneyed phrases, Ucas advises: ""Be authentic, be focused, be enthusiastic."" Alex Hayman, managing director ofWhich? University,externaltells would-be undergraduates their personal statements are ""a key opportunity for you to showcase your individuality, knowledge and experience"". Your personal statement could ""make the difference when it comes to receiving an offer from a university"". No pressure then, and it's particularly tough if you are the first person in your family to apply to university. Even Ucas admits: ""It's scary"". Which? has launched apersonal statement builder,externalto help applicants write their first drafts. Alex Hayman says it's crucial for statements to be ""reflective and, importantly, personal"" and he has highlighted seven ways to convince the admissions tutor to offer you a place. ""Your personal statement is your opportunity to demonstrate to an admissions tutor that you are serious about higher education. ""Show your understanding of what studying a degree would entail by demonstrating your awareness of the pressures and commitment needed - and your readiness to see the degree through,"" says Mr Hayman. ""Demonstrate you are the right candidate for the course and university by not only showing that you meet the entry requirements, but that you also have a strong grasp of, and engagement with, what studying this discipline at degree level entails. ""Use examples of academic work or projects to support this."" ""It's important to display an interest in the subject outside your current syllabus. This could be further reading around the subject - but anything from podcasts, periodicals, exhibitions or performance could also help. ""You should also reflect what you've learned through relevant paid or unpaid work or volunteering, particularly for vocational courses."" ""What are your motivations for applying for this course? Why did you decide this is the right one for you? And if it's something you haven't studied before what strengths will help you cope? Give examples of these in action. Are you good at working independently, teamwork, problem-solving or leadership, for example? ""Regardless of subject, studying at degree level is all about thinking independently and analytically. ""It will make you look very impressive if you can demonstrate or explain how one of the subjects that you have previously studied has made you think more critically and how."" ""Don't let a disappointing GCSE (or, in Scotland, National 5) performance automatically put you off applying to the university course you really want. ""If you haven't got the best results then it will be important to demonstrate your academic ability through your predicted A-level grades (or other advanced-level qualification, such as BTECs) and your passion and determination in your personal statement. Take time to research course entry requirements, says Alex Hayman of Which? ""However, regardless of the subject you want to study, the majority of university courses look for at least GCSE C grades in English maths and perhaps science - that's grade 4 or 5 under the new structure. ""And some of the more competitive universities will ask for very high A-level grades for most subjects - and an equally strong set of GCSEs. ""Spend time researching the entry requirements of a range of courses to see what's open to you."" ""Don't worry, there's no pressure to have your future mapped out quite yet - but do include any ideas on how your degree might help you in the next step towards any plans or career goals. ""Think of it as another opportunity to showcase your individuality.""

"Sources being checked for new antibiotics include the blood of Komodo dragons Over-reliance on and misuse of antibiotics has led to warnings of a future without effective medicines. Why is it so difficult for scientists to discover new drugs? It's a tale of scientific discovery taught the world over: the serendipitous find of a mould that revolutionised modern medicine. Almost 90 years ago, Alexander Fleming returned from holiday to find Penicillium on Petri dishes left in his basement laboratory at St Mary's Hospital in London. By the 1950s, the golden age of antibiotic discovery, an array of new medicines was being found. Today, scientists are searching for a new breakthrough, testing microbes in sources as diverse as soil, caves andKomodo dragon blood, as well as developing new, lab-made synthetic drugs. Yet despite these remarkable advances, we are running out of effective antibiotics - the drugs that fight infection and are essential for everything from organ transplants to the treatment of food poisoning. Deadly bacteria resistant to penicillin, or the more than 100 different antibiotics since developed, are already killing 700,000 people every year. Unchecked, the global toll could rise to10 million a year by 2050,external. If the problem is so serious, why, in this age of incredible medical and scientific endeavour and advance, is it so difficult to get the new antibiotics the world so desperately needs? The answer lies partly in scientific challenge and partly in the broken economy of research and development work. Perhaps the less well known part of Fleming's story is the long period of research and collaboration which followed, before, in the 1940s, Penicillium became the world's first antibiotic. Alexander Fleming in his laboratory at St Mary's Hospital Or that Fleming himself cautioned from the earliest days that bacteria could become resistant to drugs. As a patient, antibiotics can seem such a simple treatment for infection, but the pills have a complex relationship with the very bacteria they are designed to destroy. All microorganisms evolve and those that develop defences against antibiotics will survive, while the defenceless will be killed. The more antibiotics we use, the faster the process of bacteria developing resistance becomes. The result of misuse and overuse, in human and animal health, is a continual race to stay ahead of the superbugs. Scientists believe Komodo dragon blood may contain acompound which could treat infected wounds Leaf-cutter ants in the Amazon have been found to usebacteria to protect their nests,external Thedirt under our feet,externalcontinues to be an important source of new antibacterial compounds An antibiotic that can fight some superbugs was foundinside the human nose,external ADalek in the foyer of the BBC,external's New Broadcasting House was found to have four potential novel antibiotics It's easy to find chemicals that kill bacteria. The challenge is that it's much more difficult to discover and develop substances that are not also toxic to humans. The path from discovery to clinically approved medicine is necessarily long and the failure rate is high. The process starts with basic research to identify organisms which produce antibiotic substances. Thousands of possibilities will be screened - a process which in itself can take years. Scientists look at different chemicals, combinations of chemicals and ways to weaken bacteria. Some might try to attack the cell wall; others interfere with the way the bacterial cell functions, or with its metabolism. When a candidate is found this must be tested on known infectious bacteria. Then, if the results are promising, it will be tested for its possible toxicity to humans and must be produced at scale. Only then can the years of clinical trials begin. In total it takes around 10 to 20 years from discovery to medicine. A fifth of antibiotic prescriptions are unnecessary, Public Health England says Coughs or bronchitis may take three weeks to clear on their own, but antibiotics reduce that by just one to two days, it says An estimated 5,000 people die in England each year as a result of drug-resistant infections Worldwide, if unaddressed, drug-resistant infections could kill more people than cancer by 2050 Animals consume a large proportion of antibiotics - as much as 80% in the US Of course, with complexity and uncertainty comes cost. This is where the broken economy comes into play. Antibiotics are not only complex to develop, the most innovative new products also cannot be sold freely. Instead, they must be put on the shelf in reserve for serious cases - as is the case withcolistin, the ""drug of last resort"". This doesn't present an appealing investment opportunity, and over the past 30 years pharmaceutical companies have significantly decreased their work developing new antibacterial therapies. No new classes of antibiotics have been invented for decades. In fact, all the antibiotics brought to the market in the past 30 years have been variations on existing drugs discovered by 1984. Most worryingly, it was as long ago as 1962 that the last new class of antibiotics to treat those infected by the most resistant gram-negative superbugs was discovered. These include multi drug-resistant bacteria which can cause severe and often deadly bloodstream infections and pneumonia. They pose a particular threat in hospitals, nursing homes and for patients treated with devices such as ventilators and catheters. Other priorities include increasingly drug-resistant bacteria that cause more common diseases such as gonorrhoea and food poisoning caused by salmonella. In recent years, as awareness of drug-resistant infections has increased and politicians have taken heed of the warnings long given by doctors and scientists, the public and private sectors have begun to work together to find solutions. As of May 2017, a total of 51 antibiotics were in the clinical pipeline - around a third targeting priority pathogens, 12 families of bacteria seen as posing the greatest threat to human health. But only a small number are innovative products - those not based on existing classes of antibiotics. Should you finish a course of antibiotics? WHO lists 'most threatening' superbugs Oral sex spreading unstoppable bacteria How we can stop antibiotic resistance New drugs are vital but they are only part of the solution. We also need to explore the potential for vaccines to protect against infection in the first place. And better, more accurate diagnosis of infections could help doctors know as quickly as possible the best and most appropriate treatments. We also need a better understanding of where drug-resistant infections are spreading, not just in people, but also in animals and the environment. Improving hygiene in hospitals, clinics and communities across the world would help stop infection taking hold in the first place. If we are to succeed in getting and staying ahead of superbugs we cannot rely on Fleming's luck in 1928. More needs to be done to ensure industry and governments work together to test promising treatments and bring them to market. Perhaps most importantly of all, we must give this miraculous and marvellous medicine the respect it deserves. Antibiotics, old and new, are a valuable resource, to be used only when necessary for protecting and improving health. About this piece This analysis piece was commissioned by the BBC from an expert working for an outside organisation. Tim Jinks is head of drug-resistant infections at the Wellcome Trust, which describes itself as a global charitable foundation working to improve health for everyone. The Wellcome Trust is supporting antibiotic discovery through its US partnership, CARB-X. In the past year it has announced funding for 18 projects targeting the most urgent drug-resistant gram-negative bacteria, including eight potential new classes of antibiotics.

"Australian MPs are not allowed to be citizens of ""a foreign power"" Five Australian politicians have been disqualified from parliament for having dual citizenship when they were elected in 2016. Among them is the deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce, whose disqualification threatens the government's voting majority. The nation's highest court found five of seven MPs under scrutiny were in breach of Australia's constitution which requires candidates for federal office to not be a ""subject or citizen of a foreign power"". Most of the politicians said they had not known of their second citizenship when they were elected, and the government argued that only those who had ""voluntarily obtained, or retained"" their foreign citizenship should be disqualified. However the court decided against that argument, and only ruled in favour of two MPs who they said did not attain citizenship. So who are the affected politicians? Barnaby Joyce said he was ""shocked"" to learn of his dual status Dual citizenship:New Zealand (renounced in August) How did he acquire it?Mr Joyce was born in Australia but his father is from New Zealand, which automatically awarded the politician citizenship. His team argued Mr Joyce was ""not aware of the possibility he might be a New Zealand citizen under New Zealand law."" What was his defence?Mr Joyce cannot be held to account for having only the ""mere knowledge"" of his father's birthplace, his legal team argued. Unlike the other six, who are senators, Mr Joyce sits in the lower House of Representatives - meaning his ineligibility leaves the government's one-seat majority up in the air. What did the court say?The court stuck to a literal reading of the constitution: if a politician had held actual dual citizenship at the time of their election, the election was invalid - regardless of whether they were aware of their dual citizenship or not. In the case of Mr Joyce, the court acknowledged that at the time of his election in 2016, he believed the clause in question did not apply to him because he thought he was an Australian citizen only. The court also said Mr Joyce ""has never applied to become a New Zealand citizen"" and has ""not sought or accepted any privileges as a citizen of New Zealand"". However, the court nonetheless ruled that because he was a citizen of New Zealand, he was ""incapable of being chosen or sitting as a member of the House of Representatives"". More: NZ confirms Joyce is citizen Fiona Nash is deputy leader of the Nationals, the junior Coalition partner Dual citizenship:UK (renounced in August) How did she acquire it?Australian-born Ms Nash became a UK citizen by descent through her Scottish-born father, to whom she was estranged for much of her life. Her older sisters were born in England and have UK citizenship. What was her defence?That like Mr Joyce she had no previous knowledge of her citizenship. ""Her parents had informed her that unlike in the case of her sisters, who were British citizens by birth, she could only become a British citizen upon making an application, which had not occurred,"" hersubmission,externalsaid. Her lawyer said laws that provided citizenship by descent were ""exorbitant"", and would disqualify MPs who had only a ""slender connection"" to a foreign power. What did the court say?Fiona Nash's election was invalid because she held dual citizenship at the time of her election More: Nash caught up in citizen saga Matt Canavan, also from the Nationals, has temporarily stepped down from ministry Dual citizenship:Italy (renounced in August) How did he acquire it?Mr Canavan has Italian grandparents. In July, he said his mother had organised his citizenship - without his knowledge - when he was 25. But he later said his mother had not done this. His lawyers said Mr Canavan gained his dual status through an Italian court decision on citizenship by descent in 1983. What was his defence?His lawyers argued this was a ""quirk of history"" and said it was questionable whether Mr Canavan had even received Italian citizenship in the first place. His lawyers also argued that if he did have citizenship, he should not be disqualified because he had no knowledge of his status. They said a strict interpretation of the rule would lead to political opponents conducting ""genealogical witch hunts"". What did the court say?Matt Canavan's election was valid. The court concluded that ""given the potential for Italian citizenship by descent to extend indefinitely - generation after generation - into the public life of an adopted home"", full Italian citizenship required the taking of ""positive steps [...] as conditions precedent to citizenship"". More: How Canavan learned of predicament Malcolm Roberts had disputed he was elected as a dual citizen Dual citizenship:UK (renounced in December) How did he acquire it?:Mr Roberts was born in India to a Welsh father in 1955, making him a UK citizen. He was naturalised as an Australian in 1974. UK authorities said he revoked his citizenship five months after he was elected in Australia's July 2016 election. What is his defence?Mr Robertsclaimed,externalhe took ""bona fide"" steps to relinquish his citizenship, but it was not made official until 5 December. His lawyers argued he had the strongest case of all the MPs because he had made clear attempts to rid himself of his citizenship prior to his election. However a court in September found that Mr Robert's efforts to do this had failed, and included attempts such as sending renunciation queries to the wrong email address. What did the court say?Malcolm Robert's election was invalid because he held dual citizenship at the time of his election. Nick Xenophon has described his UK citizenship as ""useless"" Dual citizenship:UK (British Overseas Citizenship) How did he acquire it?Mr Xenophon's father was born in Cyprus when it was a UK colony, and the politician inherited British Overseas Citizenship. He has played down the ""third-class citizenship"" as not even allowing him to live in the UK, describing it as a ""colonial peculiarity"". What was his defence?In addition to lack of knowledge, his lawyers argued that the unusual form of British citizenship did not include the ""core"" elements of citizenship. A few days prior to the court hearings, Mr Xenophon flagged he would step down from office to re-enter state politics. What did the court say?Nick Xenophon's election was valid. While the court confirmed that Mr Xenophon did hold British Overseas Citizenship (BOC) at the time of his election,  it ruled that it did not give him the full rights and privileges usually linked to full citizenship - most importantly the right to live and enter the UK without immigration control as a normal UK citizen would be able to. The court concluded he was ""not a subject or a citizen of the United Kingdom at the date of his nomination and election as a senator. Nor was he entitled to the rights and privileges of a subject or citizen of the United Kingdom."" Larissa Waters, former Greens senator Larissa Waters says she made an ""honest mistake"" Dual citizenship:Canada How did she acquire it?Ms Waters was born in Canada but left as a baby with her Australian parents. She said she was oblivious to her Canadian status until July. What was her defence?Unlike the previous five MPs, Ms Waters resigned over her dual citizenship. Her team did not try to defend her eligibility and instead said she had ""properly complied"" with the constitution. Her lawyers argued the other politicians should have taken the same actions and urged the court not to reward ""negligence"" for those who had not investigated their citizenship status diligently. The government included Ms Waters in its submission, a move she said was ""pretty clear self-interest in trying to save their own, and a few extras"". What did the court say?Larissa Waters' election was invalid because she held dual citizenship at the time of her election. More: History-making breastfeed senator quits Scott Ludlam was first to reveal dual citizenship, igniting the saga Dual citizenship:New Zealand How did he acquire it?Mr Ludlam was born in New Zealand but his family left the country when he was three. He said he had always believed - wrongly - that his New Zealand citizenship had expired when he became an Australian citizen in his teens. What was his defence?Like Ms Waters, Mr Ludlam resigned and maintains he was right to do so. Ms Waters' legal team also acted for him. The government argues that Mr Ludlam voluntarily retained his citizenship, and, along with Mr Roberts, should be ruled ineligible. What did the court say?Scott Ludlam's election was invalid because he held dual citizenship at the time of his election.

"This video can not be played Pinc's flying drone scans warehouse packages Flying drones and robots now patrol distribution warehouses - they've become workhorses of the e-commerce era online that retailers can't do without. It is driving down costs but it is also putting people out of work: what price progress? It could be a scene from Blade Runner 2049; the flying drone hovers in the warehouse aisle, its spinning rotors filling the cavernous space with a buzzing whine. It edges close to the packages stacked on the shelf and scans them using onboard optical sensors, before whizzing off to its next assignment. But this is no sci-fi film, it's a warehouse in the US - one of around 250,000 throughout the country, many gargantuan in size: retail giant Walmart's smallest warehouse, for example, is larger than 17 football fields put together. And these automated drones are now doing the jobs humans - on foot, or operating fork-lift trucks and mechanical lifts - used to do: and they're doing them more cheaply and more accurately. ""Every year companies lose billions of dollars due to misplaced items and faulty inventory records in their warehouses,"" says Fadel Adib, an assistant professor of media, arts and sciences at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Hardis Group's EyeSee drone can fly autonomously ""Today's inventory management requires workers to scan items manually, which is a very time consuming and error-prone process. It's impossible to keep track of all items in the warehouse."" Two drones can do the work of 100 humans over the same time period, according to supply chain specialist, Argon Consulting. This means they can do several tours of a warehouse - even at night - compare results, identify discrepancies, and build up a much more accurate picture much more quickly. Drone makers claim scanning accuracy of close to 100%. Matt Yearling, chief executive of Pinc, one of the firms offering such aerial robots, says they can save warehousing and logistics companies millions of dollars. ""Nobody has 100% accuracy - including Walmart and Amazon,"" he says. ""For a warehouse that is 95% accurate, it means that 5% is ambiguous. So if the warehouse is storing $100m [Â£75m] worth of inventory, then $5m is uncertain. ""Typically the retailer will have more than one warehouse. So, if you multiply the problem across the warehouse network you are talking big dollars."" Pinc's drones use hydrogen fuel cells, enabling them to fly for up to two hours - four times as long as some battery-powered drones. How you could be Postman Pat for a day and earn extra cash How can you help your local online business go global? From sweets to furniture: The secrets of selling online 'Tell me phone, what's destroying my crops?' French firm Hardis Group has also launched an inventory-scanning drone - EyeSee - and emphasises how autonomous it is. ""Flight orders and flight plan execution are ensured by our Android application,"" says Stephane Cadenet, manager of the firm's drone programme. ""Our solution is simple to use: no installation, no infrastructure adaptation and no driver. The only thing to do is unpack the drone. The calculation of the flight plan is automatic."" Other companies, such as Infinium Robotics, have also developed drone scanning systems. Of course, retailers have been using robots and automated systems in warehouses for some years.In 2012, fashion brand Net-A-Porter said its robot pickers were already 500% faster than humans,while online retailer Amazon's Kiva robots have almost become famous. This video can not be played Instead of humans walking miles to pick goods, these robots take the shelves to the pickers ""Innovators are working to make drones and robots an integral part of warehousing, inventory, and logistics,"" says JP Gownder, a principal analyst at research firm Forrester. ""Over the next 10 years, these technologies look set to revolutionise these spaces."" But all this cost saving and efficiency comes at the expense of jobs for humans. The $2.3tn e-commerce industry is huge and growing, but almost 75% of e-commerce companies employ no more than four people. So it is no coincidence that in the US some 89,000 shop workers were laid off between October and April this year, while employment in New York City clothing stores has declined for three consecutive years. Forrester estimates that automation technologies, including artificial intelligence, will replace 17% of US jobs by 2027. And growth in new types of employment will not be enough to compensate. ""Automation does create opportunities for new jobs - equivalent to 10% of today's jobs,"" says Mr Gownder. ""But that still leads to a net 7% loss of jobs due to automation, which has to be made up by macro-economic growth, non-automation related jobs, and monetary policy."" This video can not be played The Ocado warehouse run by robots Ryan Bax, industry analyst for mobility at research consultancy Frost & Sullivan, concedes that the use of drones and robotics in warehousing will lead to job losses, but believes growth elsewhere will compensate for this. ""As automation reduces the demand for lesser qualified jobs, the need for specialised skills within the logistics sector will grow,"" he maintains. And he thinks automation tech may even become mandatory once it has been shown to reduce accidents in the workplace. ""The use of automated technologies will permit warehouses to operate 24-hour days and improve stock management accuracy, but beyond this they will provide significant benefits to safety within the workplace."" This will be small comfort for the thousands of warehouse workers displaced by drones and robots, but it is the inevitable consequence of our desire for online convenience, cheaper prices and faster deliveries.

"Mr Ross missed a House of Commons vote as he was officiating at a Barcelona match in the Champions League Scottish Tory MP Douglas Ross has told football authorities he will no longer accept refereeing appointments when Parliament is sitting. It means he will not be in the running to officiate at next summer's World Cup in Russia. Mr Rosswas criticised for missing a debate on Universal Creditto run the line at a Champions League match. He defended that decision in a letter to constituents saying he knew he would not be able to speak in the debate. Mr Ross told BBC Scotland that he had made ""difficult, personal decision"" on his job in football, but said his ""number one priority was standing up for the people of Moray"". The MP, who has been a referee for 15 years and was first elected a Moray councillor 10 years ago, said he had not been prepared for the level of criticism he received for missing the debate earlier this month. Mr Ross was in Spain for the Barcelona v Olympiakos game on the same day as the Universal Credit debate was held at Westminster. Prime Minister Theresa May was forced to defend him after SNP MP John McNally raised the issue by brandishing a red card across the chamber. Mr Ross said: ""I don't need to be ticked off by anyone to know that you don't want to be on the prime minister's radar for reasons such as this. ""You want to be on the prime minister's, anyone's, radar for good reasons."" Mr Ross said SNP campaign leaflets accusing him of putting football before parliamentary work had meant constituents were aware that refereeing was a big part of his life. But he added that before the election he gave a commitment not to allow his football job to impact on his parliamentary duties. He said: ""I only have one priority which is to stand up for the people of Moray. ""I had given a commitment to the people of Moray and I hope this sends a signal that I was genuine about that."" Mr Ross, a former MSP,was also criticised in November last yearfor missing a Scottish Parliament committee meeting to run the line in a Champions League match in Portugal. It led to calls for him to stand down from his frontbench role as the Scottish Conservatives' justice spokesman. Mr Ross later went on todefeat the SNP's Westminster leaderAngus Robertson at the general election in June. Earlier, ina statement given to online community newspaper Inside Moray,external, the Moray MP said he recognised he could no longer balance his football job with his political one.

"Open heart surgery appears to be safer in the afternoon because of the body's internal clock, scientists have said. The body clock - or circadian rhythm - is the reason we want to sleep at night, but it also drives huge changes in the way our bodies work. The research,published in the Lancet,external, suggests the heart is stronger and better able to withstand surgery in the afternoon than the morning. And it says the difference is not down to surgeons being tired in the morning. Doctors need to stop the heart to perform operations including heart valve replacements. This puts the organ under stress as the flow of oxygen to the heart tissue is reduced. The doctors and researchers looked for complications including heart attacks, heart failure or death after surgery. They found: 54 out of 298 morning patients had adverse events 28 out of 298 afternoon patients had adverse events Afternoon patients had around half the risk of complications One major event would be avoided for every 11 patients operated on in the afternoon One of those involved in the research, Prof Bart Staels, from the Institut Pasteur de Lille, told the BBC News website: ""We don't want to frighten people from having surgery - it's life saving."" He also said it would be impossible for hospitals to conduct surgery only after lunch. But Prof Staels added: ""If we can identify patients at highest risk, they will definitely benefit from being pushed into the afternoon and that would be reasonable."" Obesity and type 2 diabetes have been shown to increase the risk of complications after surgery. Heart health is already known to fluctuate over the course of a day. The risk of a heart attack or stroke is highest first thing in the morning, while the heart and lungs work at their peak in the afternoon. Dr John O'Neill, from the UK Medical Research Council's Laboratory of Molecular Biology, said: ""Scientifically it is not hugely surprising, because just like every other cell in the body, heart cells have circadian rhythms that orchestrate their activity. ""Our cardiovascular system has the greatest output around mid/late-afternoon, which explains why professional athletes usually record their best performances around this time."" BBC Body Clock: What makes you tick? Body clock scientists win Nobel Prize Weekend camping resets body clock Other possible explanations for the findings included surgeons being tired in the morning or their own body clock affecting their surgical skill, particularly if they are not ""morning people"". But Prof Staels said the researchers had gone to great lengths to show that the difference in survival rates was not down to the surgeons. The French team also experimented on cardiac tissue samples from patients and showed they beat more readily in the afternoon. And an analysis of the DNA in the samples found 287 genes whose activity showed a circadian rhythm - waxing and waning during the day. They then moved into mice and used experimental drugs to alter the activity of one of those genes and seemed to be able to reduce the risk of death. Prof Staels said: ""We believe we have identified a potential way to circumvent the disturbing observation that operations in the morning lead to more complications."" However, that will require more research to confirm. The researchers are also investigating whether circadian rhythms have an impact on survival in other types of surgery. Dr Mike Knapton, from the British Heart Foundation, said: ""Thousands of people now have open heart surgery in the UK. If this finding can be replicated in other hospitals this could be helpful to surgeons planning their operating list, for non-urgent heart surgery. Follow Jameson Twitter,external.

"This video can not be played What will top-secret JFK files tell us about Kennedy's killer? The US government has released 2,800 previously classified files on the assassination of President John F Kennedy in 1963. President Donald Trump said the public deserved to be ""fully informed"" about the event, which has been the subject of numerous conspiracy theories. But some documents have been withheld at the request of government agencies. One memo revealed thatthe FBI had warned police of a death threat,externalagainst the assassin Lee Harvey Oswald. ""We at once notified the chief of police and he assured us Oswald would be given sufficient protection"", writes the FBI director J Edgar Hoover. Oswald, a former Marine and self-proclaimed Marxist, was shot dead in the basement of the Dallas Police department two days after President Kennedy was killed. As the documents are pored over and analysed, other findings include a CIA memo that suggestsOswald spoke with a KGB officer,externalat the Russian embassy in Mexico City. The memo says the KGB officer Oswald spoke with worked for a department ""responsible for sabotage and assassination"". Another memo showed thatSoviet officials feared an ""irresponsible general"",externalwould launch a missile at the USSR in the wake of President Kennedy's death. One memo tells howa British regional newspaper, the Cambridge News, received an anonymous call about ""some big news"" in the US, minutes before the assassination. A copy of the memo was released by the National Archives in the US in July, but had gone unreported. The president and first lady in Dallas less than an hour before his assassination President Kennedy was shot dead on 22 November 1963 as he travelled through Dallas in an open-topped limousine. The Warren Commission's report into the shooting, published in September 1964, said that Lee Harvey Oswald had fired the fatal shots from the Texas School Book Depository building. JFK Files: The most interesting points There was ""no evidence that either Lee Harvey Oswald or Jack Ruby was part of any conspiracy, domestic or foreign"", the commission said. A 1992 law passed by Congress required all records related to the assassination - around five million pages - to be publicly disclosed in full within 25 years. The deadline was Thursday. More than 90% of the files were already in the public domain. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Allegations of a government cover-up are unlikely to be assuaged by reports that the CIA, FBI, Department of State and other agencies lobbied at the last minute to keep certain documents under wraps.

""Therefore, I am ordering today that the veil finally be lifted,"" the president wrote. JFK assassination: Questions that won't go away JFK and the rise of conspiracy theories Some redacted documents are undergoing a further six-month review, but it is possible those records could stay secret after the deadline on 26 April next year. The president, according to White House officials, was reluctant to agree to agency requests to hold the remaining documents. ""I have no choice - today - but to accept those redactions rather than allow potentially irreversible harm to our Nation's security,"" Mr Trump added in his memo.

"Sources being checked for new antibiotics include the blood of Komodo dragons Over-reliance on and misuse of antibiotics has led to warnings of a future without effective medicines. Why is it so difficult for scientists to discover new drugs? It's a tale of scientific discovery taught the world over: the serendipitous find of a mould that revolutionised modern medicine. Almost 90 years ago, Alexander Fleming returned from holiday to find Penicillium on Petri dishes left in his basement laboratory at St Mary's Hospital in London. By the 1950s, the golden age of antibiotic discovery, an array of new medicines was being found. Today, scientists are searching for a new breakthrough, testing microbes in sources as diverse as soil, caves andKomodo dragon blood, as well as developing new, lab-made synthetic drugs. Yet despite these remarkable advances, we are running out of effective antibiotics - the drugs that fight infection and are essential for everything from organ transplants to the treatment of food poisoning. Deadly bacteria resistant to penicillin, or the more than 100 different antibiotics since developed, are already killing 700,000 people every year. Unchecked, the global toll could rise to10 million a year by 2050,external. If the problem is so serious, why, in this age of incredible medical and scientific endeavour and advance, is it so difficult to get the new antibiotics the world so desperately needs? The answer lies partly in scientific challenge and partly in the broken economy of research and development work. Perhaps the less well known part of Fleming's story is the long period of research and collaboration which followed, before, in the 1940s, Penicillium became the world's first antibiotic. Alexander Fleming in his laboratory at St Mary's Hospital Or that Fleming himself cautioned from the earliest days that bacteria could become resistant to drugs. As a patient, antibiotics can seem such a simple treatment for infection, but the pills have a complex relationship with the very bacteria they are designed to destroy. All microorganisms evolve and those that develop defences against antibiotics will survive, while the defenceless will be killed. The more antibiotics we use, the faster the process of bacteria developing resistance becomes. The result of misuse and overuse, in human and animal health, is a continual race to stay ahead of the superbugs. Scientists believe Komodo dragon blood may contain acompound which could treat infected wounds Leaf-cutter ants in the Amazon have been found to usebacteria to protect their nests,external Thedirt under our feet,externalcontinues to be an important source of new antibacterial compounds An antibiotic that can fight some superbugs was foundinside the human nose,external ADalek in the foyer of the BBC,external's New Broadcasting House was found to have four potential novel antibiotics It's easy to find chemicals that kill bacteria. The challenge is that it's much more difficult to discover and develop substances that are not also toxic to humans. The path from discovery to clinically approved medicine is necessarily long and the failure rate is high. The process starts with basic research to identify organisms which produce antibiotic substances. Thousands of possibilities will be screened - a process which in itself can take years. Scientists look at different chemicals, combinations of chemicals and ways to weaken bacteria. Some might try to attack the cell wall; others interfere with the way the bacterial cell functions, or with its metabolism. When a candidate is found this must be tested on known infectious bacteria. Then, if the results are promising, it will be tested for its possible toxicity to humans and must be produced at scale. Only then can the years of clinical trials begin. In total it takes around 10 to 20 years from discovery to medicine. A fifth of antibiotic prescriptions are unnecessary, Public Health England says Coughs or bronchitis may take three weeks to clear on their own, but antibiotics reduce that by just one to two days, it says An estimated 5,000 people die in England each year as a result of drug-resistant infections Worldwide, if unaddressed, drug-resistant infections could kill more people than cancer by 2050 Animals consume a large proportion of antibiotics - as much as 80% in the US Of course, with complexity and uncertainty comes cost. This is where the broken economy comes into play. Antibiotics are not only complex to develop, the most innovative new products also cannot be sold freely. Instead, they must be put on the shelf in reserve for serious cases - as is the case withcolistin, the ""drug of last resort"". This doesn't present an appealing investment opportunity, and over the past 30 years pharmaceutical companies have significantly decreased their work developing new antibacterial therapies. No new classes of antibiotics have been invented for decades. In fact, all the antibiotics brought to the market in the past 30 years have been variations on existing drugs discovered by 1984. Most worryingly, it was as long ago as 1962 that the last new class of antibiotics to treat those infected by the most resistant gram-negative superbugs was discovered. These include multi drug-resistant bacteria which can cause severe and often deadly bloodstream infections and pneumonia. They pose a particular threat in hospitals, nursing homes and for patients treated with devices such as ventilators and catheters. Other priorities include increasingly drug-resistant bacteria that cause more common diseases such as gonorrhoea and food poisoning caused by salmonella. In recent years, as awareness of drug-resistant infections has increased and politicians have taken heed of the warnings long given by doctors and scientists, the public and private sectors have begun to work together to find solutions. As of May 2017, a total of 51 antibiotics were in the clinical pipeline - around a third targeting priority pathogens, 12 families of bacteria seen as posing the greatest threat to human health. But only a small number are innovative products - those not based on existing classes of antibiotics. Should you finish a course of antibiotics? WHO lists 'most threatening' superbugs Oral sex spreading unstoppable bacteria How we can stop antibiotic resistance New drugs are vital but they are only part of the solution. We also need to explore the potential for vaccines to protect against infection in the first place. And better, more accurate diagnosis of infections could help doctors know as quickly as possible the best and most appropriate treatments. We also need a better understanding of where drug-resistant infections are spreading, not just in people, but also in animals and the environment. Improving hygiene in hospitals, clinics and communities across the world would help stop infection taking hold in the first place. If we are to succeed in getting and staying ahead of superbugs we cannot rely on Fleming's luck in 1928. More needs to be done to ensure industry and governments work together to test promising treatments and bring them to market. Perhaps most importantly of all, we must give this miraculous and marvellous medicine the respect it deserves. Antibiotics, old and new, are a valuable resource, to be used only when necessary for protecting and improving health. About this piece This analysis piece was commissioned by the BBC from an expert working for an outside organisation. Tim Jinks is head of drug-resistant infections at the Wellcome Trust, which describes itself as a global charitable foundation working to improve health for everyone. The Wellcome Trust is supporting antibiotic discovery through its US partnership, CARB-X. In the past year it has announced funding for 18 projects targeting the most urgent drug-resistant gram-negative bacteria, including eight potential new classes of antibiotics.

"Spain has announced it is preparing to suspend Catalonia's regional autonomy, after the Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont threatened to declare independence. Even before this move, separatists had condemned the actions of the Spanish government and police during an outlawed independence referendum on 1 October. Some called those actions repressive - a sentiment expressed most clearly ina video produced by the Catalan cultural organisation Omnium Cultural,external. It's been viewed more than a million times. One of the most striking claims in the video was that police subjected Catalan voters to ""a degree of force never seen before in a European member state"". After Spain's constitutional court declared the poll illegal, police officers were authorised to stop it going ahead. They prevented some people from voting, and seized ballot papers and boxes at polling stations. Speaking to the BBC on Sunday, Spain's foreign minister Alfonso Dastis, claimed images of police violence were ""fake"". Who is correct? This video can not be played Many pictures showing Spanish police acting violently during the referendum were fake - Spanish foreign minister It is true that fake photos have been used but virtually all of the media coverage showing police violence was real - including all of that shown by the BBC. Photos which are six years old have been shared online purporting to show violence in Catalonia on 1 October. For example, this photo was shared in a manner that suggested a disabled Catalan voter was being hit with a baton. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Andphotojournalists saw police firing rubber bullets,external, Indeed, the Spanish Government accepts there was some violence - andhas apologisedfor it. When protesters tried to stop police officers removing ballot boxes, they were dragged out of the way. So there was police violence on 1 October. Was it the worst ever seen in an EU member state? Some of the early reports of injuries were exaggerated. One woman had claimed that police had intentionally broken her fingers. In reality, her fingers weren't broken, just inflamed - as she explained to the Catalan state broadcaster TV3 after she'd received treatment. On 20 October, the Catalan department of health released revised figures of the number of people who had sought medical treatment because of police action on polling day. These figures were gathered by the various hospitals, clinics and paramedics who treated them. They say 1,066 people sought medical treatment, 991 on the day and 75 in the days that followed. Most people - 886 - were classed as having only a minor injury or condition. Five were considered to be seriously injured. These figures are from the Department of Health, which is a branch of the Catalan government. We have no way of independently verifying whether all 1,066 injuries were caused by police officers. This is the only data available, and has been used in arguments by both sides of the independence debate. SOURCE: Catalan Department of Health Earlier totals had been disputed by Spanish ministers and newspapers - arguing that people might turn up at a clinic despite having no medical complaint. However, the Catalan health service insists everyone included in these latest figures received a diagnosis from a medical professional. Twelve police officers were also injured on polling day. This figure is agreed by both the Catalan department of health and the Spanish government. It is difficult to find examples where as many civilians were injured during clashes with police. Yet when assessing the level of violence, the degree of force is important, not just the number of injuries. Police used tear gas to disperse anti-austerity protesters in Athens in 2012. There are various cases where police in EU member states used an equivalent or even higher degree of force in public. Here are some recent examples: A man died last yearwhen police in Belfast used CS spray during a violent incident in the city centre German police in Hamburg used water cannonto disperse protesters at this summer's G20 summit. 270 were treated for injuries - and 20 of those were treated as inpatients. Dozens of protesters were injured in Athenswhen police used tear gas after anti-austerity protests turned violent in 2012.

"Sources being checked for new antibiotics include the blood of Komodo dragons Over-reliance on and misuse of antibiotics has led to warnings of a future without effective medicines. Why is it so difficult for scientists to discover new drugs? It's a tale of scientific discovery taught the world over: the serendipitous find of a mould that revolutionised modern medicine. Almost 90 years ago, Alexander Fleming returned from holiday to find Penicillium on Petri dishes left in his basement laboratory at St Mary's Hospital in London. By the 1950s, the golden age of antibiotic discovery, an array of new medicines was being found. Today, scientists are searching for a new breakthrough, testing microbes in sources as diverse as soil, caves andKomodo dragon blood, as well as developing new, lab-made synthetic drugs. Yet despite these remarkable advances, we are running out of effective antibiotics - the drugs that fight infection and are essential for everything from organ transplants to the treatment of food poisoning. Deadly bacteria resistant to penicillin, or the more than 100 different antibiotics since developed, are already killing 700,000 people every year. Unchecked, the global toll could rise to10 million a year by 2050,external. If the problem is so serious, why, in this age of incredible medical and scientific endeavour and advance, is it so difficult to get the new antibiotics the world so desperately needs? The answer lies partly in scientific challenge and partly in the broken economy of research and development work. Perhaps the less well known part of Fleming's story is the long period of research and collaboration which followed, before, in the 1940s, Penicillium became the world's first antibiotic. Alexander Fleming in his laboratory at St Mary's Hospital Or that Fleming himself cautioned from the earliest days that bacteria could become resistant to drugs. As a patient, antibiotics can seem such a simple treatment for infection, but the pills have a complex relationship with the very bacteria they are designed to destroy. All microorganisms evolve and those that develop defences against antibiotics will survive, while the defenceless will be killed. The more antibiotics we use, the faster the process of bacteria developing resistance becomes. The result of misuse and overuse, in human and animal health, is a continual race to stay ahead of the superbugs. Scientists believe Komodo dragon blood may contain acompound which could treat infected wounds Leaf-cutter ants in the Amazon have been found to usebacteria to protect their nests,external Thedirt under our feet,externalcontinues to be an important source of new antibacterial compounds An antibiotic that can fight some superbugs was foundinside the human nose,external ADalek in the foyer of the BBC,external's New Broadcasting House was found to have four potential novel antibiotics It's easy to find chemicals that kill bacteria. The challenge is that it's much more difficult to discover and develop substances that are not also toxic to humans. The path from discovery to clinically approved medicine is necessarily long and the failure rate is high. The process starts with basic research to identify organisms which produce antibiotic substances. Thousands of possibilities will be screened - a process which in itself can take years. Scientists look at different chemicals, combinations of chemicals and ways to weaken bacteria. Some might try to attack the cell wall; others interfere with the way the bacterial cell functions, or with its metabolism. When a candidate is found this must be tested on known infectious bacteria. Then, if the results are promising, it will be tested for its possible toxicity to humans and must be produced at scale. Only then can the years of clinical trials begin. In total it takes around 10 to 20 years from discovery to medicine. A fifth of antibiotic prescriptions are unnecessary, Public Health England says Coughs or bronchitis may take three weeks to clear on their own, but antibiotics reduce that by just one to two days, it says An estimated 5,000 people die in England each year as a result of drug-resistant infections Worldwide, if unaddressed, drug-resistant infections could kill more people than cancer by 2050 Animals consume a large proportion of antibiotics - as much as 80% in the US Of course, with complexity and uncertainty comes cost. This is where the broken economy comes into play. Antibiotics are not only complex to develop, the most innovative new products also cannot be sold freely. Instead, they must be put on the shelf in reserve for serious cases - as is the case withcolistin, the ""drug of last resort"". This doesn't present an appealing investment opportunity, and over the past 30 years pharmaceutical companies have significantly decreased their work developing new antibacterial therapies. No new classes of antibiotics have been invented for decades. In fact, all the antibiotics brought to the market in the past 30 years have been variations on existing drugs discovered by 1984. Most worryingly, it was as long ago as 1962 that the last new class of antibiotics to treat those infected by the most resistant gram-negative superbugs was discovered. These include multi drug-resistant bacteria which can cause severe and often deadly bloodstream infections and pneumonia. They pose a particular threat in hospitals, nursing homes and for patients treated with devices such as ventilators and catheters. Other priorities include increasingly drug-resistant bacteria that cause more common diseases such as gonorrhoea and food poisoning caused by salmonella. In recent years, as awareness of drug-resistant infections has increased and politicians have taken heed of the warnings long given by doctors and scientists, the public and private sectors have begun to work together to find solutions. As of May 2017, a total of 51 antibiotics were in the clinical pipeline - around a third targeting priority pathogens, 12 families of bacteria seen as posing the greatest threat to human health. But only a small number are innovative products - those not based on existing classes of antibiotics. Should you finish a course of antibiotics? WHO lists 'most threatening' superbugs Oral sex spreading unstoppable bacteria How we can stop antibiotic resistance New drugs are vital but they are only part of the solution. We also need to explore the potential for vaccines to protect against infection in the first place. And better, more accurate diagnosis of infections could help doctors know as quickly as possible the best and most appropriate treatments. We also need a better understanding of where drug-resistant infections are spreading, not just in people, but also in animals and the environment. Improving hygiene in hospitals, clinics and communities across the world would help stop infection taking hold in the first place. If we are to succeed in getting and staying ahead of superbugs we cannot rely on Fleming's luck in 1928. More needs to be done to ensure industry and governments work together to test promising treatments and bring them to market. Perhaps most importantly of all, we must give this miraculous and marvellous medicine the respect it deserves. Antibiotics, old and new, are a valuable resource, to be used only when necessary for protecting and improving health.

"This video can not be played Alice says a lack of services affected her recovery Young people are facing long waiting times and unequal access to mental health services, a review by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) has said. The commissioner said this could be ""putting young people's lives at risk"". The review found nearly 40% of specialist child and adolescent services in England needed improvement. Alice Gibbs, who was diagnosed with anorexia at the age of 12, said a lack of access to specialised services had had a long-term effect on her recovery. She waited six months to see a mental health professional. ""Knowing that we had to wait for that help and things were only getting worse was scary,"" she says. She received treatment in Leicester for several years, but it was later recommended that she get specialist treatment. At the time, the nearest specialist unit for eating disorders was in London. ""It's a complete postcode lottery,"" she says. ""I was 16 years old, and apart from being really physically unwell, I was mentally unwell. I didn't want to be away from my family."" The CQC's Dr Paul Lelliott said the ""system's complexity and fragmentation must be overcome"". ""There are many people out there working to make sure that children and young people who experience mental health issues are offered caring support. Their dedication is to be celebrated. ""However, we must also address those times when a child or young person feels let down or not listened to and make sure the same level of support is available."" While the report could not specify exactly how long young people were waiting, an investigation by the BBC'sWorld at One programmeusing Freedom of Information requests found children were waiting up to 22 months to see a mental health professional. Of the nine trusts that replied, the worst was Cambridgeshire & Peterborough, which had an average wait of 16 weeks in 2016-2017. Dr Andrew Molodynski from the British Medical Association said: ""Gaining access to necessary specialist care remains a serious concern in places. It is a need the government must address as a priority."" The review's findings echo issues raised by NHS England in itsFive Year Forward View for Mental Health,external, published in February. Problems identified included long waiting times, inequalities in access to services and a lack of support while young people were waiting for care. NHS England's head of mental health Claire Murdoch said after ""years of underinvestment"" there has been a 15% increase in spending on young people's mental health services in the past year, ""far outstripping the overall rise in mental health spending"". ""Without a doubt, after years of drought, the NHS' mental health funding taps have now been turned on."" Alice Gibbs made the hard decision to stay in Leicester for non-specialist treatment. Now 22, she says she's a lot better. But she is still receiving mental health care and thinks this may not have been the case if she had received better, more specialised care as a teenager. ""I'm lucky because I have had all of that support but it's frustrating to think that realistically it could be a lot better than this,"" she says. Alice says she has learned how to manage her eating disorder ""rather than fix it"". ""With eating disorders, it feels like it's defining you. And it definitely has with me - it defined all of my teenage life.""
