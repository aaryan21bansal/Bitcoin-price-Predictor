"Emma Stone stars in the Netflix drama Maniac Netflix added seven million new customers in the three months to September, bringing its global total to more than 137 million. The stronger than expected growth - a record for the third quarter - sent shares up 11% in after-hours trading. The surge came as Netflix premiered a record amount of original programming, including new seasons of Orange Is The New Black and BoJack Horseman. Netflix is among the first of the major US tech firms to report its results. Investors were looking for signs of a rebound at the company after anunusually weak second quarter, which had fanned worries about the online streaming firm's future. Netflix faces increased competition from traditional media companies and giants such as Amazon and its costs have been growing as it spends more on its own material. How Netflix went from pioneer to powerhouse Sky brings Netflix on board The firm plans to spend as much as $8bn on content this year, with more than a quarter devoted to original programming. Analysts estimate that it added about 676 hours of original programming in the US in the most recent quarter - 135% more than in the same period last year. Netflix's The Crown received 13 Emmy nominations this year Netflix said the investments were critical to the firm's growth. ""We recognise we are making huge cash investments in content, and we want to assure our investors that we have the same high confidence in the underlying economics as our cash investments in the past,"" it said in a letter to investors. Subscriber growth is key to keeping up with the investments. Netflix had expected to add about five million members in the quarter. The actual total included about one million new subscribers in the US and almost 5.9 million abroad. Revenue in the quarter increased 34% year-on-year to nearly $4bn, while profits more than tripled to $403m. Shares have surged more than two-thirds this year and closed on Tuesday at $346.40 in New York, valuing the company at almost $154bn. George Salmon, a Hargreaves Lansdown analyst, called it a ""strong set of results"". ""Heavy investment in content means free cash flow is still negative, but after a disappointing second quarter this release was all about subscriber growth,"" he said. ""There's also very upbeat guidance around customer additions in the final quarter of the year, with the group's forecast of 9.4 million well above prior expectations. If video killed the radio star, Netflix is well on the way to taking cable's crown.""

"Two snub-nosed monkeys are pictured resting on a stone and staring intently into the distance. What are they looking at, and what are they thinking? It turns out they are watching a big barney between members of their troop. This image of apparent serenity versus commotion is the overall winner of the2018 Wildlife Photographer of the Year,externalcompetition, announced at a gala dinner at London's Natural History Museum. The picture was taken by Marsel van Oosten in China's Qinling Mountains. The Dutchman had to follow the troop for many days to understand the animals' dynamics and predict their behaviour. His goal was to show in one shot the beautiful hair on a male snub-nosed monkey's back, and the creature's blue face. Marsel's perseverance eventually paid off with this exquisite composition that includes a smaller female behind. The photographer told BBC News he was ""shocked and honoured"" to receive the award. ""I am happy that it is with this particular image because it is an endangered species and one that very few people even know exists and it is important that we realise that there are a lot of species on this planet that are under threat. ""It is not only rhinos, tigers and polar bears; and these kind of species deserve a lot more attention and all the protection they can get."" The image is not showy or shocking as WPY winners sometimes are. But there is something enthralling there that pulls you in, says Roz Kidman Cox, the chair of the competition's judges. ""As we were going through the entries, we just kept coming back to this one,"" she recalls. ""It's almost like a stage set. I think what makes it are the colours and the lighting. ""These monkeys normally feed in the trees, but somehow Marsel's managed to catch them on the ground, and he's carefully thrown a very gentle flash on to the scene to illuminate that amazing fur."" The junior winner this year is Skye Meaker from South Africa for his picture of a dozy leopard in Botswana's Mashatu Game Reserve. The animal is well known and goes by the name of Mathoja, which in the Bantu language means ""the one that walks with a limp"". The leopard broke a leg as a juvenile. It survives but has to fight hard because unlike other big cats it cannot pull dead prey into the trees to eat it, says Skye. That means eating on the ground where hyenas are always trying to pinch a kill. ""We waited several hours to get this shot. I wanted Mathoja's eyes to be open, and just for a couple of minutes that's what happened. Mathoja looked straight at us."" As well as his grand title, 16-year-old Skye wins the 15-17 Years Old category. He has a big future, believes Kidman Cox: ""I've had enough of leopards on a log; it's a cliche. But Skye has something different here. I think again it's to do with the light; the dappled green in the background. And then there's the expression on the leopard's face."" Here are some other section winners: 10 Years And Under category -This shot is taken by another youngster, Arshdeep Singh. He won his section for this photo taken just outside Kapurthala, a city in the Indian state of Punjab. He says: ""I saw the owls fly in the tube and I told my dad. He said that's not possible, but he stopped the car. We had to wait 20 or 30 minutes until they came out again, and then I took the picture."" Animals In Their Environment category- Cristobal Serrano from Spain took this shot of crabeater seals resting on an ice floe off the Antarctic Peninsula. The seals have a close relationship with the sea-ice because it is the habitat that provides shelter and food (algae) for krill, tiny crustaceans. And it is the krill that are the main food source for the seals. Behaviour: Invertebrates category- Georgina Steytler took this picture of mud-dauber wasps in Walyormouring Nature Reserve in Western Australia by getting down to their level. In the mud. ""I just got down in it with a long lens, taking shot after shot. I wanted to get one of the wasps carrying a mud ball, and to get two was incredible. It's luck but you have to be in the right place at the right time with the right equipment."" The wasps use the balls to build nest chambers where they lay eggs on the paralysed bodies of spiders. Underwater category- This is a flying fish captured in the lens of American photographer Michael Patrick O'Neill. It was taken during a night dive off Florida's Palm Beach. These fish are very timid during the day but at night are easier to approach. Michael tried various camera and light settings to get this other worldly impression of the animal. Wildlife Photojournalism category- This shocking image of a street monkey was taken by Joan de la Malla on the island of Java, Indonesia.  It is a macaque that has been forced to wear a clown's mask. ""It is painful and the macaque has its hand up to try to remove it,"" says Joan. The Spanish photographer has been working with animal welfare groups to try to get this type of street performance shut down. In the last couple of weeks, this has happened; and this particular animal, known as Timbul, is heading back to the wild. Wildlife Photographer Portfolio category- Javier Aznar GonzÃ¡lez de Rueda, another Spanish photographer, entered a series of images, with this one featuring the Alchisme treehopper. The picture, taken in the El JardÃ­n de los SueÃ±os reserve in Ecuador, shows a mother guarding her nymphs. A treehopper will lay her eggs on the underside of a nightshade leaf and then cover them with a thin secretion. Once the eggs hatch, they develop through five nymphal stages, differing in size, colour and ornamentation. Behaviour, Amphibians and Reptiles category- A Hellbender salamander holds a northern water snake in its jaws in this photo taken in Tennessee's Tellico River. David Herasimtschuk says the snake eventually managed to escape after wrestling with North America's largest aquatic salamander. Earth's Environments category- The top of a high dune on Namibia's desert Skeleton Coast, where mounds of wind-sculpted sand merge with crashing Atlantic waves. Look closer and you will see the fog that often forms in this region of Africa. As the fog drifts inland it delivers life-sustaining moisture to plants and insects. WPY is one of the most prestigious competitions of its type in world photography. Started in 1964, the competition is now organised by London's Natural History Museum. An exhibition of the best images opens at the South Kensington institution on Friday. Next year's competition starts taking entries from Monday.

"Pompeii was famously destroyed on 24 August in 79 AD - or was it? Archaeologists in Italy have uncovered an inscription they say may show that the history books have been wrong for centuries. Historians have long believed that Mount Vesuvius erupted on 24 August 79 AD, destroying the nearby Roman city of Pompeii. But now, an inscription has been uncovered dated to mid-October - almost two months later. Italy's culture minister labelled it ""an extraordinary discovery."" ""The new excavations demonstrate the exceptional skill of our country,"" Alberto Bonisoli said. Historians have been able to date the eruption of Vesuvius with apparent certainty thanks to ancient writings that purported to share first-hand accounts. They came from Pliny the Younger, an elite lawyer and author of ancient Rome, who wrote about the death of his even more famous uncle, Pliny the Elder. ""On the 24th of August, about one in the afternoon, my mother desired him to observe a cloud...""he wrote in a letter to Tacitus,external, a Roman senator and historian, about the events of that day. According to his account, Pliny the Elder was then a fleet commander at Misenum - modern day Miseno - across the bay from Pompeii. He took a ship to stage a rescue for those in danger from the volcano. Flying rock crushed Pompeii victim's head Pompeii's not-so-ancient Roman remains But he did not return from the venture. Pliny the Younger, meanwhile, watched the destruction unfold from the other side of the bay. ""I have faithfully related to you what I was either an eye-witness of myself or received immediately after the accident happened, and before there was time to vary the truth,"" he wrote. But the latest discovery calls such certainty into question. A simple charcoal scrawl may prove centuries of historical texts wrong The inscription discovered in the new excavations is nothing more than a scrawl in charcoal, likely made by a worker renovating a home. But it is dated to 16 days before the ""calends"" of November in the old Roman calendar style - which is 17 October in our modern dating method. ""Since it was done in fragile and evanescent charcoal, which could not have been able to last long, it is highly probable that it can be dated to the October of AD 79,"" the archaeology team said in a statement. They believe the most likely date for the eruption was, in fact, 24 October. There has long been some speculation that the eruption happened later than August, particularly centred around evidence of autumnal fruits and heating braziers discovered in the ruins. The charcoal inscription supports that theory, the Pompeii archaeology team said. The latest excavations at Pompeii are uncovering 2,000-year-old works of art So did Pliny the Younger record things incorrectly? His letter to Tacitus was written some 20 years after the eruption in 79 AD. And the original copies have not survived the intervening 1,939 years. Instead, our modern reading of the text is based on translations and transcriptions made over the centuries. In fact, various copies of the letters have contained dates ranging anywhere from August to November - though 24 August has long been accepted. The differences between the texts could easily have been influenced by confusion over the ancient and modern systems of counting days. The discovery was made in the new Regio V excavation, uncovering previously untouched areas of the ancient city. In addition to the simple inscription, grand houses have been unveiled this week with elaborate frescoes and mosaics.

"Radical preacher Anjem Choudary has had his assets frozen, days before he is due to leave prison. The 51-year-old, who was jailed for five-and-a-half years for inviting support for the Islamic State group, is expected to be released on Friday. The BBC understands police have been preparing a list of up to 20 measures to control the east London preacher. The government's asset freezing team confirmed,externalChoudary had been listed on a global record of known terrorists. Former Met terror chief Richard Walton told BBC Newsnight that Choudary was a ""hardened dangerous terrorist"" and someone who has had a ""huge influence on Islamist extremism in this country"". The international list, overseen by the United Nations Security Council, is designed to prevent targets spending money on their causes. In the entry, Choudary, who headed the banned al-Muhajiroun network, is described as a resident of Frankland Prison in County Durham and also known by the alias, Abu Luqman. It states that Choudary ""pledged allegiance to Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL)"". Security concerns over Choudary release How Anjem Choudary's mouth was finally shut The asset freezing order means the preacher will be subject to extremely strict financial controls which typically mean that any attempt to open a bank account or move money will alert the authorities. If his release goes ahead on Friday, the BBC understands that Choudary will stay in a probation hostel for up to the first six months of his licence, which continues until July 2021. The BBC also understands Choudary will be subject to licence conditions including: A ban from preaching at or attending certain mosques He will only be allowed to associate with people who have been approved by the authorities He will be allowed one phone and is banned from using an internet-enabled device without permission Use of the internet will be supervised He will not be able to leave the UK without permission from his probation officer This video can not be played The former head of counter-terror at the Met police speaks to Newsnight ahead of Anjem Choudary's release Mr Walton told BBC Newsnight that he tried to convict Choudary 10 times over 12 to 13 years, but failed because the the law ""was not robust enough"". He saida new counter-terrorism bill,external, which is currently with the House of Lords, would address this issue and will allow police to prosecute below the existing threshold for incitement to commit terrorism. He added that more convicted terrorists are due to be released, saying they will ""place a burden on the police and the intelligence agencies"". Choudary is due for automatic release after serving half his sentence.

"Lisa Savage and Sarah Hayton were aboard the Gloucester to Cardiff train when the attack happened on April 15 A ""dangerous"" woman serving a life sentence has been jailed again for trying to kill her friend on a train. Lisa Savage, 42, was on probation when she attacked Sarah Hayton, shouting ""go to sleep little girl"" and leaving her needing 87 stitches. On her arrest in a park in Chepstow, Savage told police: ""I'm a psycho killer"". She will serve a minimum of eight years and four months after admitting attempted murder and having a blade. Judge Eleri Rees said Savage poses ""a high risk of harm to the public"" and the attack was ""frenzied and sustained"". Savage planned to confront her mother in Aberdare with two knives Savage had 13 previous convictions for 67 offences, including 15 of violence, Newport Crown Court heard. In 2000, she was handed a life sentence and jailed for a minimum of three years for slashing an ex-partner across his face and mouth. She had been released from prison on licence for that offence when she attacked Miss Hayton on April 15. Savage, who was carrying two knives, planned to confront her mother in Aberdare, south Wales, after receiving a text saying she wanted nothing to do with her. Prosecutor Anna Midgley said: ""Miss Hayton explains that the attack... began when she said she no longer wanted to go to Aberdare to confront the defendant's mother. ""The defendant's reaction was to begin raging and to take out a knife which she had packed and to stab Miss Hayton repeatedly."" Lisa Savage's victim 'believed she was going to die' CCTV footage showed Savage repeatedly stabbing Miss Hayton, before prising open the train door to escape. Train passengers in the carriage were ""extremely frightened"", staff had locked themselves in the cabin for safety and the victim ""believed she was going to die"", said Miss Midgley. A train guard spotted Miss Hayton crawling and covered in blood at Chepstow station and alerted police, who later found Savage in a park. Det Ch Insp Jaci Thomas from British Transport Police said: ""This was a shocking and vicious attack, and I am pleased we have been able to bring Lisa Savage to justice.""

"This video can not be played Speaker: Commons needs new body to investigate bullying John Bercow has told friends he intends to stand down as Commons Speaker next summer, the BBC understands. His departure, in June or July, would coincide with his tenth year in office. The news comes after a damning report on the failure of high level figures in Parliament to deal adequately with bullying of staff at Westminster. Dame Laura Cox's report condemned a culture in which abusive behaviour was ""tolerated and covered up"", prompting calls for Mr Bercow to quit right now. Speaking in the Commons, Former Tory cabinet minister Maria Miller told Mr Bercow a ""complete change in leadership"" was needed at the top of the parliamentary authorities ""including you"". Who is John Bercow? Bercow 'should quit' after bullying report Dame Laura Cox's lightning strike One of Mr Bercow's critics, Tory Andrew Bridgen, said his announcement was a ""pre-emptive strike to head off calls for him to go immediately"" and another, James Duddridge, said it was a ""smokescreen"" and the Speaker was ""not fit"" to lead an overhaul of Commons working practices. The BBC understands from well-placed sources the Speaker has told friends and close associates he is still considering how and when to announce his departure. ""He doesn't want it to look as if he's been forced out,"" said one. ""But it may be it won't be enough, and some people will insist he goes much sooner."" This video can not be played Maria Miller: ""There needs to be complete change in leadership at the most serious level - including you Mr Speaker."" Approached for a comment on the Speaker's plans, a spokeswoman said: ""The Speaker was elected by the House in 2017 for the course of the Parliament. In the event he has anything to say on his future plans, he will make an announcement to the House first."" When he took the job in June 2009, Mr Bercow said his intention was to quit by June of this year, after nine years in the chair. He has since said he means to stay on and see Parliament through the process of Brexit, which is due to conclude with the UK's exit on 29 March 2019. Mr Bercow, a former Tory MP who represents Buckingham, has denied claims he bullied two of his former private secretaries - claims which MPs opted not to investigate earlier this year. This video can not be played ""The constitutional future of this country ...trumps bad behaviour""  Dame Margaret Beckett tells Radio 4's  PM Although Dame Laura did not investigate individual cases, she said highly-placed figures should consider whether they could change the culture in Parliament and, if not, ""consider their position."" Speaking in Parliament earlier, Mr Bercow called for an independent body to be set up to investigate allegations, telling MPs they should learn the lessons of the expenses scandal, which led to external oversight of financial claims. The new regulator, he said, should be able to decide whether historical cases dating back many years could be investigated - something not currently allowed. But a number of MPs said Mr Bercow, who is already the longest-serving Speaker since World War Two, was not the right man to oversee the changes and should make way. Mr Bercow's three predecessors, Bernard Weatherill, Betty Boothroyd and Michael Martin, each spent between eight and nine years in the role. Mr Bercow is a divisive figure in Parliament, seen as reformer by some but partisan by others The Cox report,external, announced in March after a wave of allegations of inappropriate behaviour by MPs and ministers in late 2017, details alleged sexual harassment of women who say they were ""inappropriately touched"" and ""repeatedly propositioned"". There were reports of men trying to kiss women ""grabbing their arms or bottoms or stroking their breasts or bottoms"". Staff reported men putting their arms around women's shoulders or waists or ""pulling them into corners for close personal contact"". A senior figure has described the atmosphere within the Parliamentary senior establishment as akin to ""panic"" in the aftermath of the report. The complaints system set up three months ago now seems likely to be opened up to previously excluded historical complaints against MPs - potentially inviting a fresh wave of politically and personally embarrassing allegations. In the climate of recriminations and counter-recriminations, a source in Parliament blamed government whips - in both main parties - for pressing to limit the range of admissible complaints in the past. ""They wanted to use the information privately to help control their MPs."" Commons leader Andrea Leadsom said the new complaints procedure was working well but it was ""far from job done"" and harassment must be ""stamped out"" completely. Allow Twitter content?

Several MPs have warned that the issue of inappropriate behaviour in the Commons must not be politicised in partisan wrangling over Mr Bercow's own future. The speaker is likely to play a key role in parliamentary debates over Brexit in the coming months, leading one senior Labour figure to claim it was not the ""right time"" for any change. Green MP Caroline Lucas called for ""independent processes, not innuendos"" while Labour's Jess Phillips said she, unlike other MPs, had actually spoken to those affected by bullying. ""Some of us don't actually care who is the offender, it is the victims we care about. ""We will not use it for political gain. Nothing fills the victims with more dread than when people play with their feelings so don't do it."" However, others warned against a witch-hunt, with ex-Conservative minister Sir Desmond Swayne saying most MPs acted ""perfectly properly"" and were not treated like ""demi-gods"" by their staff.

Golden Modz posts videos on YouTube One of the hacks available on Mr Lucas's website is aimbot, which lets players automatically target and kill enemies without having to aim their weapon. It is only available for the PC version of the game, but offers a significant competitive advantage to any player using the cheat. In Mr Lucas's latest YouTube video he ""trolls default skins"" - players who may be new and have yet to change their character's appearance. Several other videos in which he used the aimbot cheat have been removed from YouTube following a copyright complaint from Epic Games. Another YouTube gamer, Colton Conter, is also named in the legal filing. In the documents, Epic Games said the cheaters were ""creating unauthorised derivative works of Fortnite by unlawfully modifying the game's code"". The company told the BBC it did not comment on active legal cases. But it said in a statement: ""When cheaters use aimbots or other cheat technologies to gain an unfair advantage, they ruin games for people who are playing fairly. We take cheating seriously, and we'll pursue all available options to make sure our games are fun, fair, and competitive for players."" Epic Games is headquartered in the US state of North Carolina. The case was filed in the Eastern District of North Carolina. In October, Epic Games took over anti-cheat software firm Kamu as part of its efforts to tackle unauthorised modifications to its games. In a video called, Golden Modz sued by Fortnite, Mr Lucas said he was not sure why Epic Games had taken action. ""I'm confused because there's about a thousand other content creators on YouTube that make Fortnite content,"" he said in the video, adding that others used hacks ""without repercussions"". Fortnite Battle Royale sees 100 players land on an island to look for weapons and build defences. The person who survives the longest wins. It is regularly played by more than 75 million people around the world and is the most viewed game on streaming site Twitch. On Monday, Epic Games announced it was adding new tournaments to the game, which would let players compete to win a shiny badge. Players will be matched with those of a similar skill level. However, all players - whether on PC, console or smartphone, will play against one another. Some critics have suggested this will give PC gamers a competitive advantage.

"This video can not be played Speaker: Commons needs new body to investigate bullying John Bercow has told friends he intends to stand down as Commons Speaker next summer, the BBC understands. His departure, in June or July, would coincide with his tenth year in office. The news comes after a damning report on the failure of high level figures in Parliament to deal adequately with bullying of staff at Westminster. Dame Laura Cox's report condemned a culture in which abusive behaviour was ""tolerated and covered up"", prompting calls for Mr Bercow to quit right now. Speaking in the Commons, Former Tory cabinet minister Maria Miller told Mr Bercow a ""complete change in leadership"" was needed at the top of the parliamentary authorities ""including you"". Who is John Bercow? Bercow 'should quit' after bullying report Dame Laura Cox's lightning strike One of Mr Bercow's critics, Tory Andrew Bridgen, said his announcement was a ""pre-emptive strike to head off calls for him to go immediately"" and another, James Duddridge, said it was a ""smokescreen"" and the Speaker was ""not fit"" to lead an overhaul of Commons working practices. The BBC understands from well-placed sources the Speaker has told friends and close associates he is still considering how and when to announce his departure. ""He doesn't want it to look as if he's been forced out,"" said one. ""But it may be it won't be enough, and some people will insist he goes much sooner."" This video can not be played Maria Miller: ""There needs to be complete change in leadership at the most serious level - including you Mr Speaker."" Approached for a comment on the Speaker's plans, a spokeswoman said: ""The Speaker was elected by the House in 2017 for the course of the Parliament. In the event he has anything to say on his future plans, he will make an announcement to the House first."" When he took the job in June 2009, Mr Bercow said his intention was to quit by June of this year, after nine years in the chair. He has since said he means to stay on and see Parliament through the process of Brexit, which is due to conclude with the UK's exit on 29 March 2019. Mr Bercow, a former Tory MP who represents Buckingham, has denied claims he bullied two of his former private secretaries - claims which MPs opted not to investigate earlier this year. This video can not be played ""The constitutional future of this country ...trumps bad behaviour""  Dame Margaret Beckett tells Radio 4's  PM Although Dame Laura did not investigate individual cases, she said highly-placed figures should consider whether they could change the culture in Parliament and, if not, ""consider their position."" Speaking in Parliament earlier, Mr Bercow called for an independent body to be set up to investigate allegations, telling MPs they should learn the lessons of the expenses scandal, which led to external oversight of financial claims. The new regulator, he said, should be able to decide whether historical cases dating back many years could be investigated - something not currently allowed. But a number of MPs said Mr Bercow, who is already the longest-serving Speaker since World War Two, was not the right man to oversee the changes and should make way. Mr Bercow's three predecessors, Bernard Weatherill, Betty Boothroyd and Michael Martin, each spent between eight and nine years in the role. Mr Bercow is a divisive figure in Parliament, seen as reformer by some but partisan by others The Cox report,external, announced in March after a wave of allegations of inappropriate behaviour by MPs and ministers in late 2017, details alleged sexual harassment of women who say they were ""inappropriately touched"" and ""repeatedly propositioned"". There were reports of men trying to kiss women ""grabbing their arms or bottoms or stroking their breasts or bottoms"". Staff reported men putting their arms around women's shoulders or waists or ""pulling them into corners for close personal contact"". A senior figure has described the atmosphere within the Parliamentary senior establishment as akin to ""panic"" in the aftermath of the report. The complaints system set up three months ago now seems likely to be opened up to previously excluded historical complaints against MPs - potentially inviting a fresh wave of politically and personally embarrassing allegations. In the climate of recriminations and counter-recriminations, a source in Parliament blamed government whips - in both main parties - for pressing to limit the range of admissible complaints in the past. ""They wanted to use the information privately to help control their MPs."" Commons leader Andrea Leadsom said the new complaints procedure was working well but it was ""far from job done"" and harassment must be ""stamped out"" completely. Allow Twitter content?

Several MPs have warned that the issue of inappropriate behaviour in the Commons must not be politicised in partisan wrangling over Mr Bercow's own future. The speaker is likely to play a key role in parliamentary debates over Brexit in the coming months, leading one senior Labour figure to claim it was not the ""right time"" for any change. Green MP Caroline Lucas called for ""independent processes, not innuendos"" while Labour's Jess Phillips said she, unlike other MPs, had actually spoken to those affected by bullying. ""Some of us don't actually care who is the offender, it is the victims we care about. ""We will not use it for political gain. Nothing fills the victims with more dread than when people play with their feelings so don't do it."" However, others warned against a witch-hunt, with ex-Conservative minister Sir Desmond Swayne saying most MPs acted ""perfectly properly"" and were not treated like ""demi-gods"" by their staff.

"US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met the Saudi crown prince in Riyadh on Tuesday US President Donald Trump has cautioned against rushing to blame Saudi Arabia over the disappearance of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. He told the AP news agency that Riyadh was being treated as ""guilty until proven innocent"". Mr Trump also said that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman had denied knowing what happened to Mr Khashoggi. Unnamed Turkish officials say a search of the Istanbul Saudi consulate gave more evidence that he was killed there. The journalist, a critic of the Saudi leadership, was last seen alive entering the consulate on 2 October. Saudi Arabia has denied killing him and initially said he left the building unharmed. However,the New York Times reports that four of the 15 people named by the Turkish authorities as suspects in Mr Khashoggi's disappearance have links to the crown prince,external, while another is a senior figure in the country's Interior Ministry. According to the newspaper, one of the men has been photographed accompanying the royal on recent foreign visits. What we know about Saudi journalist's disappearance Donald Trump and a world of disorder The case has put Saudi Arabia under pressure from close allies. On Tuesday, G7 foreign ministers called for Saudi Arabia to conduct a ""transparent"" probe into the issue. Meanwhile,International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde has become the latest high-profile figure to withdraw from a major Saudi investment conferencenext week following Mr Khashoggi's disappearance. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has arrived in Turkey for talks with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, following a meeting with Saudi King Salman and the crown prince on Tuesday. The Saudi heir apparent wields considerable power in the kingdom and is being held responsible by many outside for whatever happened to Mr Khashoggi. Mr Trump tweeted that Prince Mohammed had spoken to him on the phone andhe ""totally denied any knowledge of what took place in their Turkish Consulate"".,external The president said he ""told me that he has already started, and will rapidly expand, a full and complete investigation into this matter. Answers will be forthcoming shortly"". The phone call coincided with a visit to Saudi Arabia by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, sent there by Mr Trump to deal with the crisis in relations. Did Apple Watch record Khashoggi killing? Why Saudi Arabia matters to the West More firms pull out of Saudi business conference On Monday, Mr Trump speculated that ""rogue killers"" may have been behind the journalist's disappearance. In a further sign of disquiet within the US, a leading Republican senator and defender of US-Saudi links, Lindsey Graham, has been highly critical of the Saudi crown prince. ""This guy's gotta go,"" he said on Tuesday morning on Fox News, describing Prince Mohammed as a ""wrecking ball"". By Frank Gardner, BBC News The recent, highly charged exchange of words between Washington and Riyadh now appears to have given way to a mutual search for the least bad explanation. Both countries' leaders know they have an enormous amount to lose if this affair ends up splitting apart their 73-year-old strategic partnership. Iran, as the regional rival to Saudi Arabia, would be the prime beneficiary if the Saudis were to lose their defensive US umbrella. President Trump is also correct when he says thousands of US jobs would be lost, with China and Russia to be among those lining up to replace them. Which begs the wider question: is the West's relationship with Saudi Arabia so important that it outweighs the need to condemn and punish what many believe was a state-sponsored murder of a journalist inside a consulate? Hence the urgent dispatching of the US secretary of state for talks with the Saudi leadership. In private there may well be some strong words, in public both countries may want to present a united stand. But one thing is certain: whatever narrative emerges, the international reputation of the Saudi crown prince and power-behind-the-throne Mohammed Bin Salman will forever be tainted by this affair. Is this the end of Saudi prince's honeymoon? A search was due to be conducted on Tuesday of the consul's residence, some 200 metres away from the consulate. But that has now been delayed because no Saudi official can be present for what has been billed as a joint investigation, Turkish officials say. The consul, Mohammad al-Otaibi, left Turkey on a commercial flight bound for Saudi Arabia earlier in the day. On the day of Mr Khashoggi's disappearance, several vehicles with Saudi diplomatic number plates were seen on video footage moving from the consulate to the residence. Meanwhile, Turkish investigators quoted by two news agencies say Monday's search of the consulate has yielded more evidence that Mr Khashoggi was killed there. The investigation has moved to the consul's residence A Turkish official is quoted by Reuters as saying ""strong evidence"" was found but no conclusive proof. Turkish security sources have long made clear they have audio evidence pointing to his murder. The search of the consulate continued into the early hours of Tuesday. Samples, including soil from the garden and a metal gate, were reportedly taken. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told reporters the investigation ""was looking into many things such as toxic materials and those materials being removed by painting them over"". The New York Times and CNN, quoting unnamed sources, reported on Monday that Saudi Arabia would acknowledge that Mr Khashoggi's death was the result of an interrogation that went wrong. This video can not be played CCTV footage shows missing Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.

"John Bercow - who has announced plans to stand down as Commons Speaker - has been a transformative but deeply polarising holder of the historic office. The former Tory MP, best known for refereeing the weekly Prime Minister's Questions with his shouts of ""Order! Order!"" has cast himself as the backbenchers' champion - upholding Parliament's reputation and giving MPs unprecedented leeway to scrutinise government and hold ministers to account. But this has led to accusations of bias - particularly over Brexit - and of creeping egomania, along with suggestions he has ignored or rewritten longstanding parliamentary conventions. During one of many recent controversies, a former minister said he was the ""last person left in Britain who is genuinely accountable to nobody"". Commons Speaker John Bercow to stand down Parliament suspension to go ahead later In his decade in the Speaker's chair he has clashed with prime ministers, survived attempts to oust him, spoken out against the US president and played a key role as MPs have taken control of Parliament to try and stop a no-deal Brexit. But hehas been under pressureafter a damning report last year said bullying and harassment had been condoned in the Commons. Here are some key things to know about the soon-to-be-ex-MP for Buckingham. John Bercow with his wife Sally at Wimbledon The minicab driver's son first picked up a racquet at the age of eight. He became Middlesex under-12s champion, but later suffered bronchial asthma and was a casual player only thereafter. He became a member of the Commons tennis team, forming a doubles partnership with future Prime Minister David Cameron. He even wrote a book on his top 20 male tennis players, his favourite being Switzerland's Roger Federer. He sometimes plugs his favourite sport in the House of Commons, and is a regular in the Royal Box at Wimbledon. It was as a schoolboy in Finchley, then the constituency of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, that Mr Bercow became involved in politics. He joined the right-wing Monday Club, but later left, describing the views of some members as ""unpalatable"". At Essex University, Mr Bercow became chairman of the Federation of Conservative Students, an organisation closed down in 1986 by Conservative Party chairman Norman Tebbit because of its radical stances and sometimes raucous behaviour. This video can not be played The government is defeated over a bid to change the way a future Speaker is elected to the House of Commons Mr Bercow was elected Conservative MP for Buckingham in 1997. But in the early 2000s his political views altered. He became a champion of gay rights and said a clampdown on cannabis smokers would be ""absurd"". After entering the shadow cabinet, he called for Conservative MPs to be banned from membership of the Monday Club. Having established himself as one of the Conservative Party's most outspoken social liberals, he had to fend off persistent rumours he was poised to defect to Labour. And his election as Speaker was more popular on the Labour benches than the Conservative ones. In 2015, with Labour's support, he survived after a proposed rule change that was seen as an attempt to oust him by the Tory government. This video can not be played John Bercow: Wearing ties not compulsory Mr Bercow has said one of his key aims was to make the House of Commons look ""marginally less stuffy and forbidding"". This has included allowing male MPs to speak in the chamber without wearing ties, and ending the requirement for Commons clerks - the advisers who sit in front of him - to wear wigs. This didn't go down too well with some MPs, who said this could undermine Parliament's standing, and ignored tradition. After becoming Speaker in 2009, he updated his own attire by wearing a business suit, rather than the knee breeches and tights worn by his predecessors. This video can not be played Order! Order! Speaker shows he runs PMQs As Speaker, Mr Bercow is in charge of chairing debates and keeping order in the House of Commons. He regularly bemoans the rowdy atmosphere in the chamber, and isn't shy in interrupting people in full flow to tell MPs to calm down. He has been praised for ensuring backbench MPs get a proper chance to question ministers - and has also had run-ins with several politicians, some of whom think he is a little too fond of his own voice. Perhaps the most notorious dispute was with Conservative MP Sir Simon Burns, who in 2010 called him a ""stupid, sanctimonious dwarf"". Mr Bercow also regularly interrupted former Prime Minister David Cameron and has turned on other ministers, including one who used his phone in the chamber. This video can not be played The Speaker has found fame across Europe with his signature cry capturing the public's attention In 2017, he sparked a debate by speaking out against US President Donald Trump being allowed to address Parliament, saying ""opposition to racism and sexism"" were ""hugely important considerations"". This sparked a backlash from from some Conservatives, who accused him of straying beyond his politically-neutral brief. He also faced claims of bias over Brexit, after he told students in 2017 that he had voted to stay in the EU. He has dismissed claims he had displayed an anti-Brexit sticker in his car, insisting it belonged to his wife Sally and she was ""entitled to her views"" as she was ""not the chattel of her husband"". This video can not be played John Bercow is asked in the Commons about bullying allegations against him In 2018, the Speaker faced allegations of bullying, which he denies. His former private secretary, Angus Sinclair,told BBC Newsnightthe Speaker shouted and swore at him, and attempted to physically intimidate him. Another former senior official, David Leakey,said Mr Bercowcreated a climate of ""fear and intimidation"". At the time, his spokesman said there was ""no substance"" to Mr Sinclair's allegations and that while he had had ""fundamental disagreements"" with Mr Leakey, they had ""interacted adequately after that"". Asked about the allegations in the Commons, Mr Bercow responded: ""I have a superb team of dedicated, effective and long-serving staff, five of whom have served me for a collective total of over 40 years. ""I am also happy to confirm that the great majority of people who have left my service have done so on perfectly amicable terms."" Unless an early election is called, which seems unlikely, Mr Bercow has said he will remain in the Speaker's chair until 31 October. This just happens to be the date the UK is due to leave the EU or, as seems increasingly unlikely, the point at which there is a further delay. As well as more Brexit machinations and election speculation over the next eight weeks, there will also be another State Opening of Parliament and Queen's Speech - when Boris Johnson will set out his legislative programme - in which Mr Bercow is likely to play a high-profile role. To use a tennis analogy, this will give Mr Bercow the chance to umpire the Wimbledon, US Open and French Open final before making way. It is not clear what the future holds for him after his retirement. But by historical convention, former Speakers can look forward to being given a peerage and elevated to the House of Lords.

"Saudi Arabia has become a major economic and political force US President Donald Trump has threatened to inflict ""severe punishment"" on Saudi Arabia if it is found to have killed the prominent Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who disappeared while visiting the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Saudi Arabia, which has dismissed as ""lies"" claims by Turkish officials that Mr Khashoggi was murdered by Saudi agents, has vowed to respond to any punitive action by Western powers ""with greater action"". But what are the possible implications? Saudi ties with West at risk over Khashoggi What we know about Saudi journalist's disappearance Why Khashoggi case alarms Saudi activists Saudi Arabia possess about 18% of the world's proven oil reserves and is the world's biggest oil exporter, according to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec). This gives the country significant power and influence on the global stage. Prince Mohammed has said he wants Saudi Arabia to be less dependent on oil If, for example, sanctions were imposed by the US or other countries, the Saudi government could respond by cutting its oil production, which would push up global prices unless other exporters made up the shortfall. In an editorial published on Sunday,the general manager of Saudi-owned Al Arabiya TV, Turki Aldakhil, said that imposing sanctions on the kingdom would result in an ""an economic disaster that would rock the entire world"",external. ""If the price of oil reaching $80 (Â£61) angered President Trump, no one should rule out the price jumping to $100 (Â£76), or $200 (Â£152), or even double that figure,"" he wrote. Any increases would trickle down to consumers, increasing prices at petrol pumps. Saudi Arabia had the third-largest defence budget in the world in 2017, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri). That year the country signed a $110bn (Â£84bn) arms deal with the US, with options running as high as $350bn over 10 years. The deal was described by the White House as the single biggest in US history. Other countries supplying weapons to Saudi Arabia include the UK, France and Germany. Mr Aldakhil's editorial suggested that as a counter-measure to any sanctions, Riyadh could possibly look to China and Russia to fulfil its military needs. Western powers have stressed that Saudi Arabia plays a crucial role in maintaining security in the Middle East and combating extremism and terrorism. UK Prime Minister Theresa May has defended maintaining a close relationship with Saudi Arabia despite its forces being accused of war crimes in the conflict in Yemen by insisting it ""has helped keep people on the streets of Britain safe"". US President Donald Trump attended the opening of an anti-extremist centre in Riyadh in 2017 The kingdom, which is the birthplace of Islam, is a member of the US-led global coalition battling the Islamic State (IS) group and last year formed an Islamic Military Counter Terrorism Coalition with 40 other Muslim states. Mr Aldakhil speculated that the ""trusted exchange of information between Riyadh and America and Western countries will be a thing of the past"" if measures are taken in response to the disappearance of Mr Khashoggi. Saudi Arabia has worked closely with the US to counter the influence of Iran. The Sunni and Shia Muslim powers have engaged in proxy conflicts across the Middle East for decades. This video can not be played Jamal Khashoggi: What we know about the journalist's disappearance and death In Syria, Saudi Arabia has backed rebel factions trying to overthrow President Bashar al-Assad, while Iran has, along with Russia, helped turn the tide of the war decisively in his favour. In his editorial, Mr Aldakhil warned that improved relations between Saudi Arabia and Russia as a result of US sanctions and new arms deals could ""lead to a closeness to Iran and maybe even a reconciliation with it"". Why Saudi Arabia and Iran are bitter rivals Sunnis and Shia: Islam's ancient schism Saudi Arabia country profile The Al Arabiya general manager also said US companies could be ""deprived"" of access to the Saudi market. US goods and services trade with Saudi Arabia totalled $46bn in 2017, with the US enjoying a trade surplus of $5bn. The US commerce department estimated that the bilateral trade supported an estimated 165,000 jobs in the US in 2015. In August, Saudi Arabia froze all new trade with Canada over its ""interference"" in the kingdom's domestic affairs, describing Ottawa's call to release detained civil society and women's rights activists a violation of Saudi sovereignty. The kingdom also blocked imports of Canadian grain and decided to order home thousands of Saudis on government-funded scholarships at Canadian universities.

"Radical preacher Anjem Choudary has had his assets frozen, days before he is due to leave prison. The 51-year-old, who was jailed for five-and-a-half years for inviting support for the Islamic State group, is expected to be released on Friday. The BBC understands police have been preparing a list of up to 20 measures to control the east London preacher. The government's asset freezing team confirmed,externalChoudary had been listed on a global record of known terrorists. Former Met terror chief Richard Walton told BBC Newsnight that Choudary was a ""hardened dangerous terrorist"" and someone who has had a ""huge influence on Islamist extremism in this country"". The international list, overseen by the United Nations Security Council, is designed to prevent targets spending money on their causes. In the entry, Choudary, who headed the banned al-Muhajiroun network, is described as a resident of Frankland Prison in County Durham and also known by the alias, Abu Luqman. It states that Choudary ""pledged allegiance to Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL)"". Security concerns over Choudary release How Anjem Choudary's mouth was finally shut The asset freezing order means the preacher will be subject to extremely strict financial controls which typically mean that any attempt to open a bank account or move money will alert the authorities. If his release goes ahead on Friday, the BBC understands that Choudary will stay in a probation hostel for up to the first six months of his licence, which continues until July 2021. The BBC also understands Choudary will be subject to licence conditions including: A ban from preaching at or attending certain mosques He will only be allowed to associate with people who have been approved by the authorities He will be allowed one phone and is banned from using an internet-enabled device without permission Use of the internet will be supervised He will not be able to leave the UK without permission from his probation officer This video can not be played The former head of counter-terror at the Met police speaks to Newsnight ahead of Anjem Choudary's release Mr Walton told BBC Newsnight that he tried to convict Choudary 10 times over 12 to 13 years, but failed because the the law ""was not robust enough"". He saida new counter-terrorism bill,external, which is currently with the House of Lords, would address this issue and will allow police to prosecute below the existing threshold for incitement to commit terrorism. He added that more convicted terrorists are due to be released, saying they will ""place a burden on the police and the intelligence agencies"". Choudary is due for automatic release after serving half his sentence.

"The lab-engineered oesophagus was capable of wave-like muscle contractions Scientists in London have grown a bio-engineered oesophagus which was successfully implanted into mice. The work, published inNature Communications,external, was led by scientists at UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health (ICH), Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) and the Francis Crick Institute. The team hopes the research could eventually lead to clinical trials of lab-grown food pipes for children born with part of their oesophagus damaged or missing. The oesophagus is a complex, multi-layered organ, made up of multiple tissue types, which acts as a pipe carrying food and liquid from the mouth to the stomach. The team used a rat oesophagus, which was stripped of its cells, leaving behind a collagen scaffold. They seeded it with early-stage muscle and connective tissue from mice and humans, and other early rat cells which went on to form the lining on the inside of the organ. The use of stem cells from different species enabled researchers to differentiate between the origin of each tissue type which developed. The 2cm sections of oesophagus were implanted into the abdomen of mice. Dr Paola Bonfanti, co-author and group leader at the Francis Crick Institute and UCL Great Ormond Street Hospital Institute of Child Health (ICH), said: ""We were amazed to see that our engineered tissue had both the structure and function of a healthy oesophagus, and hooked up with nearby blood vessels within a week of transplantation."" The sections of oesophagus were capable of muscle contraction, which is needed to move food down to the stomach. Around one in 3,000 babies is born with abnormalities of the oesophagus, usually involving a gap between the upper and lower section, or where it does not connect with the stomach. Hudson, who was born with part of his oesophagus missing, and his twin brother, Hank Prof Paolo De Coppi, co-author and consultant surgeon at Gosh, and head of stem cells and regenerative medicine at ICH, said: ""This is a major step forward for regenerative medicine, bringing us ever closer to treatment that goes beyond repairing damaged tissue and offers the possibility of rejection-free organs and tissues for transplant."" There are several years of research required before this might be ready for clinical use, including more animal trials, involving larger mammals. The eventual aim would be to create bio-engineered organs from a pig oesophagus, which would be injected with a patient's own stem cells, in order to minimise the risk of rejection. Hudson Wakelin, aged two, was born without part of his oesophagus. He has had surgery at Gosh to lift his stomach up into his chest in order to connect it directly to his throat. It now means he can eat some of the same meals as his twin, Hank, but needs careful eating support to ensure food does not get into his windpipe. His mum, Nicola, said: ""Hudson has to eat little and often. We have to be careful that he doesn't choke, and he suffers from reflux, bringing up food and stomach acid, which can create problems."" Nearly 250 children a year are born in the UK with Hudson's condition, known as oesophageal atresia, and the research is aimed at helping those where current surgical options bring limited benefits. The field of engineered organ transplants suffered a major setback in 2016 when a surgeon in Sweden, Paolo Macchiarini, was accused offalsifying his science. Of nine patients who received a synthetic windpipe, seven died, and the two survivors had the organ replaced with a donor trachea. The team at the Crick and Gosh say the scandal reinforced their determination to proceed cautiously.

"This video can not be played The moment Anna Burns wins the Man Booker prize Anna Burns has been named the winner of this year's Man Booker Prize - becoming the first author from Northern Ireland to triumph. Milkman, set in an unnamed city in Northern Ireland during the Troubles, is a coming-of-age story about a young girl's affair with a married man. Burns, who told the BBC she was ""stunned"" to win, will receive Â£50,000 in prize money. The judges said Milkman was ""simply marvellous"". They highlighted the ""distinctive and consistently realised voice of the funny, resilient, astute, plain-spoken, first-person protagonist"". Speaking onRadio 4's Today programmeon Wednesday, Burns said the Â£50,000 prize would be life-changing. ""I'll pay my debts,"" she said. ""It will make a huge monetary difference and I will become solvent and live on what's left. ""Writers don't earn a lot of money so that's a huge gift that's been given to me,"" she went on. Milkman beat competition from Everything Under by Daisy Johnson - who, at 27, was the youngest nominee in Man Booker history. The other nominees were The Long Take by Robin Robertson, Washington Black by Esi Edugyan, The Mars Room by Rachel Kushner, and The Overstory by Richard Powers. The Duchess of Cornwall presented Burns with the trophy Milkman is the fourth novel to be written by Burns, who was born in Belfast in 1962. Her debut, No Bones, was published in 2001, and followed by Little Constructions six years later. Her most recent work prior to Milkman was Mostly Hero - a novella published in 2014. Speaking to BBC News, Kwame Anthony Appiah, the chairman of the judges, said: ""One of the wonderful things about [Milkman] is the texture of the language. ""It's written in this amazing voice of this woman who is living in a divided society. ""She's being harassed by a man who is sexually interested in her, and he's taking advantage of divisions in the society to use the power he has, because of those divisions, to go after her."" Man Booker 2018: The nominees in full Burns opted not to give names to her characters in the novel. Wven her narrator refers to herself as ""Middle Sister"". Speaking after her win, Burns told BBC News: ""The book just didn't work with names. ""There's a lack of safety of being straightforward in the book and declaring who you are. But really, if I put in names it lost power, it lost atmosphere."" Asked how her real-life experience informed her writing, Burns said: ""I was brought up in Belfast and that did have a huge influence on the book, writing about an entire society affected by long-term violence, living under intense pressure, and how that becomes normality."" The nominees were made up of three British authors, two Americans and one Canadian Writing in the Guardian,external, Claire Kilroy said: ""The narrator of Milkman disrupts the status quo not through being political, heroic or violently opposed, but because she is original, funny, disarmingly oblique and unique: different. ""The same can be said of this book."" In his five-star review in the Daily Telegraph,external, Cal Revely-Calder described the novel as ""viciously funny"". ""The pace of Milkman is leisurely at best, because its narrator experiences the plot as an entirely unwelcome event,"" he added. The New Statesman's Catherine Taylor,externalsaid every character in the novel ""crackles with intellectual verve and droll verbosity"". ""While Milkman is a work of timely universality, it is also a distinctly Irish novel. A darkly mirthful satire with a twist of Beckettian melancholy and an anarchic touch of Swift."" ""The novel is an unusual and beguiling piece of prose,""wrote Alison Garden in The Irish Times,external. ""Burns's novel also makes a searing commentary on the conservative political climate of 2018 and the domestic debris that decades of conflict have left in their wake."" Kwame Anthony Appiah praised ""the texture of the language"" in Milkman Kwame Anthony Appiah added that Milkman's lead character was ""an extremely interesting voice"". He said: ""She's witty, and the way you hear her voice in your head - I think you've never heard a voice like it before, it's completely new."" Asked whether he accepts Milkman is a challenging read, Appiah replied it was ""enormously rewarding"" provided readers persist with it. ""It is true that because of the flow of the language and the length of the sentences and the fact that some of the language is unfamiliar, that it is not a light read. ""It's challenging in the way a walk up Snowdon is challenging - it's definitely worth it because the view is terrific when you get to the top.""

"Regulators will widen their investigation into Sainsbury's planned merger with Asda to take account of the rapid rise of Aldi and Lidl. The Competition and Markets Authority will also assess the rise of online firms in its probe of a deal that would create the UK's largest grocer. The ongoing rise of Aldi and Lidl was underlined on Tuesday as they continue to win a bigger slice of the UK market. Tesco, Sainsbury's and Asda all lost out, Kantar Worldpanel data showed. There had been speculation that the rapid growth of the German discounters might not be considered in the CMA's review. But its latest update, the CMA said it has broadened its scope to include Aldi and Lidl as well as non-grocery competitors such as B&M, Amazon and John Lewis & Partners. Stuart McIntosh, chairman of the CMA's inquiry group, said: ""Millions of people shop at Asda and Sainsbury's every week, so it is essential we carry out a thorough investigation into their proposed merger. ""Our job is to find out whether the merger will result in people paying more, or being faced with less choice or a poorer quality shopping experience."" In their own submission to the CMA, Sainsbury's and Asda said that Aldi and Lidl ""have had the most profound impact"" on the grocery market over the past decade. The two companies also pointed to the launch of Jack's, Tesco's new cut-price chain. The continuing growth of Aldi and Lidl came in latest closely-watched Kantar Worldpanel data for the three months to October. Aldi and Lidl increased sales by 15.1% and 10% respectively compared with the same quarter last year. Aldi's growth was its fastest since January last year and helped it to a market share gain of 0.8 percentage points to 7.6%, while Lidl's share was slightly up at 5.6%. Tesco, the UK's biggest supermarket, saw its market share fall 0.6 percentage points to 27.4% despite sales rising by 0.9%. Sainsbury's was down 0.4 points compared with the three months last year at 15.4%, while Asda dropped 0.2 points. Co-op was the only other bricks-and-mortar retailer to gain market share with sales up 7%. Overall grocery sales rose by 3.2% compared with the same 12 weeks last year - a slight slowdown from the highs reached during the summer. Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar Worldpanel, said: ""Consumer spending often slows in early autumn, after the excesses of summer barbecues and before the festive season kicks off. ""Christmas will be here before we know it and some families seem to be getting into the spirit already - 8% of households bought mince pies last month, spending a total of Â£4m with 70 days still to go before the big day.""

"The firm that owns viral news website Unilad, which went into administration earlier this month, has been bought by social media group LADbible. The sale of Bentley Harrington safeguards the jobs of more than 200 people working for the business. Bentley Harrington collapsed with debts of Â£6.5m, including owing Â£1.5m to UK tax authorities. The Unilad Facebook account has 39 million followers and posts viral videos and news stories. Joint administrators Andrew Poxon and Andrew Duncan, of Leonard Curtis Business Rescue and Recovery, said in a statement that they had ""identified a purchaser and worked with those concerned to deliver a positive outcome for all stakeholders"". LADbible said in a separate statement: ""As of today, LADbible Group and Unilad Group are now united under the same roof. This transforms the media landscape worldwide. ""Bringing these brands together makes us the largest social video publisher ever, and a youth media brand to be reckoned with, having over 120 million followers across our social channels. In August alone, our combined videos were viewed 4.5 billion times."" The statements did not disclose the amount paid. Unilad, which has offices in London and Manchester, was founded in 2010.

"US basketball player Stephen Curry is one of the ambassadors for the new Palm phone A tiny Android smartphone designed to be a ""companion phone"" to a full-sized device has been launched in the US - using the brand name Palm. The handset is the size of a credit card and has two cameras but no headphone jack or wireless charging. It aims to help people take a break from their main phone, the firm said, despite being a fully functioning smartphone in its own right. It has been greeted with bemusement by tech commentators and on social media. The device will cost $349 (Â£263) and will be available in the US, on the Verizon network only, from November. It is described in its marketing material as ""a fully connected product that is in sync with your existing smartphone, so all of your connectivity can go where your smartphone can't"". It has the support of US basketball player Stephen (Steph) Curry who tweeted that he was ""hyped to bring Palm back"". Fashion brand Kate Spade has also designed a bespoke case for the small handset. Analyst Ben Wood from CCS Insight said it was ""certainly an ambitious move"" by the San Francisco start-up, which licensed the Palm brand from owner TCL. ""Small, so-called companion phones have been tried in the past and have not really captured consumers' imagination,"" he told the BBC. He said that it differed from other ""second"" phones because it was not reliant on Bluetooth to connect it to the parent device. Mr Wood added that he didn't think nostalgia for the 1990s Palm brand would be enough to drive sales. Palm Pilot digital assistants were popular in the late 1990s and early 2000s ""The Palm brand is perfectly suited to a product that fits in the palm of your hand,"" he said. ""Beyond that, I doubt there is much brand equity left in Palm other than for uber-geeks."" Dieter Bohn,writing for website the Verge,external, described the Palm as ""a weird little thing"". ""So here's a phone that saves you from your phone. But what saves you from your Palm? Presumably, another even smaller phone....""noted Andrew Orlowski in the Register,external.

"Karen Hadaway (left) and Nicola Fellows were murdered in 1986 A man has gone on trial for the second time accused of murdering two nine-year-old girls 32 years ago. Russell Bishop, 52, strangled Nicola Fellows and Karen Hadaway who were found dead in woods near Brighton in October 1986, the Old Bailey heard. He was cleared of their murder after a trial in 1987, jurors were told. The court heard three years later, in February 1990, he was convicted of kidnapping and trying to kill a seven-year-old girl, also in Brighton. Prosecutor Brian Altman QC said the victim was able to identify Bishop and that, together with ""scientific and other compelling evidence"", led to his conviction at Lewes Crown Court in December 1990. Russell Bishop was cleared of murdering Nicola Fellows and Karen Hadaway after a trial in 1987 The court heard Bishop's earlier acquittal for the murders of Nicola and Karen was quashed at the Court of Appeal in light of new evidence following advances in DNA testing. Mr Altman said: ""That means the defendant can be prosecuted again based on the evidence that existed then and the new evidence that is available now."" Mr Altman said similarities between the cases could lead to the ""sure conclusion"" Bishop was responsible for murdering Nicola and Karen. ""There is other compelling evidence that this man was the killer,"" he added. Bishop denies the charges. The court heard the killings led to the largest and longest-running inquiry Sussex Police has ever known. Nicola and Karen, who were friends and attended different schools in the Brighton area, had gone out to play after school on 9 October 1986, the jury was told. The court heard they both lived in the same street in Moulsecoomb near Wild Park, in the South Downs, which has a grassy bank rising to dense woods. Mr Altman said it was there - ""a mere half a mile or so from their homes"" - that the girls were found dead on 10 October. A massive police search led to the ""grim discovery"" of the friends' bodies. The court heard that Bishop joined the search for the girls. At one point Bishop told a police officer he would not like to continue searching on his own, adding he would ""hate to find the girls, especially if they had been messed up"", jurors heard. Mr Altman said: ""This was not the only time that day the defendant would say such a thing, revealing, we suggest, the knowledge that only he then had of what had become of the girls."" Post-mortem examinations showed both girls were strangled to death and sexually assaulted. The court heard, had the girls lived, Nicola would now have been 41 and Karen would have been 42 in December this year. By Helena Lee, BBC News Correspondent, at the Old Bailey Court 16 of the Old Bailey was taken back to the October afternoon 32 years ago when the schoolgirls were found dead in a wood just half a mile from their homes. Two nine-year-old friends who'd been out to play when they went missing. Girls who'd been afraid of the dark. Listening in court on the first day of the trial were their families. Karen Hadaway's mother, Michelle Hadaway, sat to the side of the dock but out of sight of Russell Bishop, the accused. She gripped her two daughters' hands as they sat by her side and closed her eyes as the jury was told where the girls were found. Mr Altman told jurors the events in the case took place well over 30 years ago and the scene had inevitably changed. He said jurors would have to make allowances for the ""real possibility of failing or faulty memory"". Some witnesses were now dead or too ill or infirm to attend, he said. Russell Bishop's earlier acquittal for the murders of Nicola and Karen was quashed at the Court of Appeal Mr Altman also told the court the case was built mostly on factual circumstances, but said: ""Do not think however that a circumstantial case is some poor relation to a case based on direct evidence such as accounts from eyewitnesses. ""There are rarely witnesses to killings like these."" He said the ""den"" where the girls were found was a small clearing hidden from view. And the prosecutor told the jury: ""Plainly the main, if not the only, motive here was sexual and paedophilic."" Jurors heard Nicola was friendly, outgoing and would speak her mind, while Karen was described as ""a very sensible girl who knew right from wrong"" but could be cheeky. The trial continues.

"The M40 northbound was closed overnight after the crash Three people have died after a car towing a caravan crashed into two cars while driving the wrong way on the M40. The Subaru Forester was travelling south on the northbound carriageway when it hit a Ford Mondeo and a Ford Focus at about 16:00 BST on Monday. The driver and passenger in the Subaru, both in their 80s, and the driver of the Ford Mondeo who was in his 30s, died in the accident. The carriageway was closed overnight but has since reopened. Thames Valley Police said no-one else had been injured in the crash, which happened between junction 6 for Watlington and junction 8A for Oxford. Sgt Beth Walton added: ""We are in the early stages of the investigation, in which sadly three people died and our thoughts are with their families.

"Blake Fischer has resigned after an email sharing photos of his hunts went viral online A wildlife official in Idaho has resigned amid a public outcry over his photos of dead animals, killed during a hunting trip in Africa. Fish and Game Commissioner Blake Fischer has apologised for the images. A photo of him smiling while holding a family of dead baboons, including a bloodied baby, sparked the most outrage among colleagues and online. Governor C L Otter said he requested Mr Fischer's resignation as he failed ""to exercise good judgment"". The governor said in a press release: ""I have high expectations and standards for every appointee in state government. Every member of my administration is expected to exercise good judgment. Commissioner Fischer did not."" Warning: Some viewers may find the images below upsetting. In September, Mr Fischer emailed his colleagues various photos of himself posing with his kills in Namibia. This hunting trip was reportedly legal. Hunter criticised for dead giraffe pose How the internet descended on the man who killed Cecil the lion 'I hunt wild animals because I love them' Among the images were photos of Mr Fischer smiling above a family of dead baboons, a giraffe, an antelope and a leopard. Mr Fischer reportedly sent this image to co-workers while bragging about his hunting exploits Local media report that Mr Fischer bragged about his hunts in the email, saying his wife wanted to get ""a feel"" of Africa, ""so I shot a whole family of baboons. I think she got the idea real quick"". With the photo of the leopard, he reportedly wrote: ""I shot a leopard. Super cool, super lucky."" After the email made the rounds, several former fish-and-game commissioners began calling for Mr Fischer to resign. According to the Idaho Statesman,external, which broke the story, ex-commissioner Fred Trevey said in an email to Mr Fischer: ""I'm sure what you did was legal, however, legal does not make it right."" ""Sportsmanlike behaviour is the centre pin to maintaining hunting as a socially acceptable activity,"" Mr Trevey said, adding that Mr Fischer's actions dismayed and disappointed him. Another ex-commissioner told the newspaper that killing a whole family of animals was ""revolting"". In his resignation letter, sent to the governor's office, Mr Fischer apologised to his fellow hunters and anglers. Mr Fischer reportedly said of this image: ""I shot a leopard. Super cool, super lucky."" ""I recently made some poor judgments that resulted in sharing photos of a hunt which did not display an appropriate level of sportsmanship and respect for the animals I harvested,"" he wrote,CBS News reported,external. ""While these actions were out of character for me, I fully accept responsibility."" Fish-and-game officials are appointed by the governor and are unpaid positions. Mr Fischer would have been in the role until June 2022. The governor's office said the process of finding his replacement has begun. The uproar around Mr Fischer's photos is the latest backlash against US trophy hunters.

"This video can not be played Holly Sargent has had to sell her possessions because of problems receiving universal credit Ministers have bowed to pressure and are planning to further delay the rollout of the flagship welfare reform, universal credit. The system - which will merge six benefits into one payment - has been beset with problems. Leaked documents seen by the BBC reveal plans to spend hundreds of millions of pounds to prevent claimants suffering hardship as they move onto it. The government said it always intended to introduce the benefit slowly. Responding to an urgent question in the House of Commons, Employment Minister Alok Sharma declined to comment on the leaked documents, and said the government would publish plans for the next stage of universal credit ""in due course"". He added that, by December 2018, universal credit would be available in all job centres for new benefits claimants. The switchover for existing benefit claimants to universal credit will be ""slow and measured"" and start in 2019 with ""no more than 10,000 people"" to ensure the system is working. MPs - including Labour's shadow work and pensions secretary Margaret Greenwood - called for a halt in the roll-out of the reform. What is universal credit? Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey told the Commons on Monday that she had been discussing details of universal credit with the chancellor - and details would be revealed in the Budget later this month. The system was supposed to be up and running by April 2017, but is now not expected to be fully operational until December 2023. The Local Government Association welcomed the delay, adding that some of the extra spending should be given to councils so they can provide a safety net to people ""struggling to cope"". It appears that big changes are going to be made in an attempt to reduce the negative impact on people being moved to universal credit. First off, plans have been drawn up to continue paying income support, employment and support allowance, and jobseeker's allowance for two weeks after a claim for universal credit has been made. A similar policy for housing benefit was introduced in last year's Budget, following evidence that some claimants were going into rent arrears. Secondly, there are to be changes to how deductions from a recipient's payment can be made. Claimants can ask for an advance to help them get by while waiting for their first proper universal credit payment - later the government takes deductions from their regular monthly income as pay back. Under the revised plans, the maximum amount that can be deducted will be reduced from 40% to 30% of their total award each month. Thirdly, more help is set to be given to the self-employed, after warnings they could be left in serious financial trouble because of incorrect assumptions by the Department for Work and Pensions about their earnings. Chancellor pressured over universal credit Benefits system 'takes women back to 1950s' Could a basic income replace universal credit? However, the documents highlight that the design of universal credit has already ruled out some concessions. Allowing claimants to receive child tax credits for a fortnight after they apply for the new benefit - which Ms McVey had asked officials to consider - has been ruled out. It would have needed two different systems - the DWP's and HMRC's - to work together to deliver the change, potentially creating additional problems. ""Not having a run-on for child tax credit will be presented as unfavourable treatment of lone parents, who many argue are the most in need of protection of the effects of the move to UC,"" the documents say. The documents seen by the BBC also make clear that the proposed concessions might not actually be achievable. An extract says: ""We can currently offer no assurance that ultimately these proposals will prove to be deliverable, can survive legal challenges where they can be delivered, and do not invite new political criticism by generating new policy issues."" This video can not be played Sir John Major warns the Conservatives over universal credit The government was intending to begin moving almost four million people onto universal credit from January 2019, initially in small batches. Larger scale movements were due to start next July. Now though, initial testing has been pushed back to next summer, and large-scale movement won't begin until November 2020 at the earliest. The leaked papers predict that overall, the latest delay will add an additional nine months to the final deadline for full implementation. The policy was first announced under the coalition government in 2010. It's supposed to simplify benefits for working-age people, replacing income support, jobseeker's allowance, employment and support allowance, housing benefit, child tax credit, and working tax credit. BBC Reality Check has broken all this down in more detail. Pressure has been mounting on the government for weeks to either delay or halt the next stage of the reform. Much criticism has centred on the time it takes for people applying for universal credit to receive their first payment - 35 days - with some claimants left struggling to pay their bills in that period. On Monday, independent MP Frank Field said the rollout of the system in his constituency of Birkenhead had driven some female claimants to sex work. One Universal Credit recipient, Naomi Krykawiak, told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme she first applied whilst pregnant, and had to wait around six weeks for the benefit to be accepted. ""It did definitely mean using food banks... it's something I had to do around eight times before the benefit was accepted."" This video can not be played Esther McVey on universal credit: Some will be worse off The Church of England said the fallout from the new benefit system was seen at its food banks across the country. More than 30 Anglican bishops have backed a campaign calling for the government to ""fix"" universal credit. Anger built further last week when Ms McVey said that ""some people will be worse off"" under the new system, amidclaims 3.2 million households,externalwill lose more than Â£2,000 year. The Times newspaper suggested she had told a cabinet meeting some families could lose up to Â£200 a month. Mrs McVey insisted, though, that the most vulnerable would be protected. A Department for Work and Pensions statement said it was taking a ""a slow and measured approach to managed migration [of the system]"" and wanted ""to ensure the system is working well for claimants and to make any necessary adaptations as we go"". ""We will publish full plans for the next stage of universal credit rollout, including managed migration, in due course. Anything before that point is speculation and we do not comment on leaks."" Labour said the government needed to provide urgent answers about what was going on and what action would be taken ""to tackle the many flaws in the system"".

"Police have recorded a surge in hate crime directed at people in England and Wales because of their religious beliefs. It rose by 40%, from 5,949 in 2016-17 to 8,336 in 2017-18, according to theHome Office data,external. Most religious hate crime - 52% of all offences - was aimed at Muslims. But the separate Crime Survey of England and Wales, which is a broader measure of people's experience of crime, showed no rise. According to Home Office data, the total number of hate incidents reached a record 94,098 from April 2017 to March 2018 - a rise of 17% from the previous year. Just over three-quarters of those - a total of 71,251 - were classified as ""race hate"". Hate crime is defined as an offence which the victim considers to be driven by hostility towards their race, religion, sexual orientation, disability or transgender identity. It can include verbal abuse, intimidation, threats, harassment, assault and bullying, as well as damage to property. The religions that police count hate crimes for are: Buddhist; Christian; Hindu; Jewish; Muslim and Sikh. They also have categories of ""no religion"", ""other"" and ""unknown"". Hostility to men and elderly could become hate crimes Police warned to do better on hate crime Defiant selfie of hate crime victim Crimes targeted at people because of their sexual orientation made up 12% of the total (11,638), with religious hatred at 9%, disability hate 8% (7,226) and transgender hate crimes 2% (1,651). According to the police figures, the number of hate crimes has more than doubled since 2012/13, when 42,255 were recorded. It is partly because of improvements in the way crimes are reported, but there have also been spikes of hate crime after events like the Brexit referendum and the terror attacks last year. People's experience of hate crime, captured in the Crime Survey of England and Wales, has gone down steadily in the last 10 years. The Home Office report said the large increases in police recorded hate crime ""may suggest that increases are due to the improvements made by the police into their identification and recording of hate crime offences and more people coming forward to report these crimes rather than a genuine increase"". And one quirk of the figures is that a single hate crime offence can be recorded more than once if it is deemed to have multiple motivations - for example, if an individual feels that they were targeted because of their race and their religion. Usman Ahmed, a Muslim, told the BBC he first experienced hate crime two years ago, when someone shouted abuse at him that referred to the Islamic State group. ""At first I was shocked and then confused as nothing like this had ever happened to me before,"" said the 19-year-old, from Luton. ""But the more I thought about it, the angrier I got. I kept thinking what had I done to deserve this?"" The Home Office has also announced a review into whether offences motivated by misandry - prejudice against men - should be classed as hate crimes. If so, it could lead to tougher sentences. Ageism and hatred of certain alternative cultures, such as Goths or punks, could also be included in future. Yvette Cooper, chairwoman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, welcomed the government's strategy but added: ""More action is needed, especially online."" It was also announced on Tuesday that despite the increase in recorded crime, the number of completed prosecutions fell from 14,480 in 2016/17 to 14,151 in 2017/18 - a drop of 329, or 2.3%. The Crown Prosecution Service said the conviction rate in hate crime cases was 84.7%, up from 83.4% the previous year. By Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondent Today's figures are the first official national count of the perceived religious target of a hate crime since ministers ordered all police forces to keep a tally. It  provides some real depth to a complex and little understood phenomenon. The number of offences targeted at Muslims or Jews was far greater than their respective proportions of the population of England and Wales. The detailed monthly figures also confirm what experts have long said - that moments of tension such as the 2016 Brexit vote, terrorism incidents or international crises trigger short-term ""spikes"" in hate. And the figures reveal that people who are targeted at home are twice as likely to be repeatedly victimised than those accosted in the street, because abusers will keep coming back. Police recorded 237 incidents where the perceived target religion was ""no religion"" at all. The Home Office told the BBC that it didn't know why some religious hate crimes had been recorded as ""no religion"" and that the figures were ""experimental"". Experts like Humanists UK say this group includes victims who have either left a faith, sparking a backlash from former co-believers, and those who had no faith in the first place. One element these figures simply don't cover is sectarianism - where one branch or sect of a faith targets another. While this is fully understood in Northern Ireland, it goes less noticed in the UK, despite the fact that it does happen. There is definitely evidence of tensions between some Sunni and Shia Muslims, the two traditions of Islam, and documented persecution of the separate small Ahmadiyya community, which is theologically rejected by others.

"The number of people who died in Scotland last winter hit an 18-year high, new statistics have revealed. There were 23,137 deaths between December 2017 and March 2018, according to the National Records of Scotland - the highest figure since 1999/2000. It also revealed that the seasonal increase in mortality - the number of ""additional"" deaths in winter - was 75% greater than in 2016/17. The main underlying causes of the deaths were influenza and pneumonia. Why did more people die last winter? Last winter saw the highest rate of flu-like illness is Scotland for seven years, leaving theNHS facing ""exceptional pressures"". Age Scotland said the National Records of Scotland (NRS) figures were ""staggering"". It joined the Royal College of Physicians and Scotland's chief medical officer in urging at-risk groups to get the flu vaccine before winter sets in. The report was published as the Scottish government admitted that there was a shortage of one of two flu vaccines being offered this winter. It said some GP practices have experienced higher than anticipated demand for the aTiv vaccine, which is given to the over 75s. However Scotland's chief medical officer Dr Catherine Calderwood told BBC Scotland more vaccine will be made available. ""People may have to return to have this but we will be able to vaccinate all those in the eligible groups, in particular the elderly, pregnant women and those with chronic diseases,"" she said. There has been higher than anticipated demand for a flu vaccine which is given to the over 75s The NRS report,externalfound that the total number of deaths in 2017/18 increased by 10.5% on the previous winter, when 20,946 deaths were recorded. Last winter's death total was the largest number since 23,379 deaths were recorded in 1999/2000. Anne Slater, the chief executive of the NRS, said there was a long-term downward trend of winter deaths since the early 1950s. ""However, the average value for the latest five years (which smoothes out much of the year-to-year fluctuation) is now above the level that had applied since the early 2000s,"" she said. ""It is too soon to say whether there has been a change in the long-term trend: it could just be a short-term rise, like that seen roughly 20 years ago, after which the average fell for several years."" It also found that there were 4,797 additional deaths last winter, compared to the average number of deaths in the four months before December 2017 and after March 2018. It was the largest increase in seasonal mortality since 1999/2000 when the figure stood at 5,190, and a significant increase on the 2,730 recorded in 2016/17. The NRS said the seasonal increase was larger than in most of the previous 66 winters and exceeded the level seen in 19 of the previous 20 winters. Around 80% of additional deaths (3,860) last winter were among people aged 75 and older. The underlying causes of most of the ""additional"" deaths included respiratory diseases, heart disease, stroke and dementia. Very few deaths were caused by hypothermia and only a small proportion directly by influenza. The Scottish Liberal Democrats' health spokesman, Alex Cole-Hamilton, said the new statistics were a ""cause for concern"" and he called on the Scottish government to ensure the NHS was ready for winter. Miles Briggs, Scottish Conservative shadow health secretary said the figures were a ""stark warning"" for the SNP that they must prepare the NHS properly for seasonal pressures. Age Scotland urged older people to reduce their risks of illness by keeping their houses warm and getting a flu vaccine. The charity's head of policy, Adam Stachura, said: ""These figures are staggering and a real shock to the system. The large increase in deaths due to flu and pneumonia should be setting alarm bells ringing. ""We know that during winter months the homes of many older people are insufficiently heated, as a result of high fuel costs and poor heating systems, and can lead to a greater risk of ill health and even death."" He said older people shouldcheck to see if they are receiving the benefits they are entitled to,external, which could help them heat their homes. The Scottish government said it was investing an extra Â£10m to support winter resilience planning, and it has commissioned work to investigate the link between winter deaths and flu, and to explore potential factors behind the rise in mortality. Dr Calderwood, the chief medical officer, said: ""Every year in Scotland, around two thirds of people who get severe flu and need intensive care treatment have a health condition such as chronic lung or heart disease. ""Last winter, Scotland had its highest flu rates for seven years, a pattern seen across Europe and the United States, and it is likely that flu was a significant factor in many deaths, particularly among older people and those with long-term conditions. ""Flu vaccines are available free to all eligible adults, including everybody aged 65 and older, and protects against a number of different flu strains. Vaccination remains our best defence against flu, and I urge people to take up the offer of a free vaccine.""

"Police have recorded a surge in hate crime directed at people in England and Wales because of their religious beliefs. It rose by 40%, from 5,949 in 2016-17 to 8,336 in 2017-18, according to theHome Office data,external. Most religious hate crime - 52% of all offences - was aimed at Muslims. But the separate Crime Survey of England and Wales, which is a broader measure of people's experience of crime, showed no rise. According to Home Office data, the total number of hate incidents reached a record 94,098 from April 2017 to March 2018 - a rise of 17% from the previous year. Just over three-quarters of those - a total of 71,251 - were classified as ""race hate"". Hate crime is defined as an offence which the victim considers to be driven by hostility towards their race, religion, sexual orientation, disability or transgender identity. It can include verbal abuse, intimidation, threats, harassment, assault and bullying, as well as damage to property. The religions that police count hate crimes for are: Buddhist; Christian; Hindu; Jewish; Muslim and Sikh. They also have categories of ""no religion"", ""other"" and ""unknown"". Hostility to men and elderly could become hate crimes Police warned to do better on hate crime Defiant selfie of hate crime victim Crimes targeted at people because of their sexual orientation made up 12% of the total (11,638), with religious hatred at 9%, disability hate 8% (7,226) and transgender hate crimes 2% (1,651). According to the police figures, the number of hate crimes has more than doubled since 2012/13, when 42,255 were recorded. It is partly because of improvements in the way crimes are reported, but there have also been spikes of hate crime after events like the Brexit referendum and the terror attacks last year. People's experience of hate crime, captured in the Crime Survey of England and Wales, has gone down steadily in the last 10 years. The Home Office report said the large increases in police recorded hate crime ""may suggest that increases are due to the improvements made by the police into their identification and recording of hate crime offences and more people coming forward to report these crimes rather than a genuine increase"". And one quirk of the figures is that a single hate crime offence can be recorded more than once if it is deemed to have multiple motivations - for example, if an individual feels that they were targeted because of their race and their religion. Usman Ahmed, a Muslim, told the BBC he first experienced hate crime two years ago, when someone shouted abuse at him that referred to the Islamic State group. ""At first I was shocked and then confused as nothing like this had ever happened to me before,"" said the 19-year-old, from Luton. ""But the more I thought about it, the angrier I got. I kept thinking what had I done to deserve this?"" The Home Office has also announced a review into whether offences motivated by misandry - prejudice against men - should be classed as hate crimes. If so, it could lead to tougher sentences. Ageism and hatred of certain alternative cultures, such as Goths or punks, could also be included in future. Yvette Cooper, chairwoman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, welcomed the government's strategy but added: ""More action is needed, especially online."" It was also announced on Tuesday that despite the increase in recorded crime, the number of completed prosecutions fell from 14,480 in 2016/17 to 14,151 in 2017/18 - a drop of 329, or 2.3%. The Crown Prosecution Service said the conviction rate in hate crime cases was 84.7%, up from 83.4% the previous year. By Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondent Today's figures are the first official national count of the perceived religious target of a hate crime since ministers ordered all police forces to keep a tally. It  provides some real depth to a complex and little understood phenomenon. The number of offences targeted at Muslims or Jews was far greater than their respective proportions of the population of England and Wales. The detailed monthly figures also confirm what experts have long said - that moments of tension such as the 2016 Brexit vote, terrorism incidents or international crises trigger short-term ""spikes"" in hate. And the figures reveal that people who are targeted at home are twice as likely to be repeatedly victimised than those accosted in the street, because abusers will keep coming back. Police recorded 237 incidents where the perceived target religion was ""no religion"" at all. The Home Office told the BBC that it didn't know why some religious hate crimes had been recorded as ""no religion"" and that the figures were ""experimental"". Experts like Humanists UK say this group includes victims who have either left a faith, sparking a backlash from former co-believers, and those who had no faith in the first place. One element these figures simply don't cover is sectarianism - where one branch or sect of a faith targets another. While this is fully understood in Northern Ireland, it goes less noticed in the UK, despite the fact that it does happen. There is definitely evidence of tensions between some Sunni and Shia Muslims, the two traditions of Islam, and documented persecution of the separate small Ahmadiyya community, which is theologically rejected by others.

"McPartlin and Armstrong were married for eleven years TV presenter Ant McPartlin and his estranged wife Lisa Armstrong have been granted a divorce. The decision was made by a judge at the Central Family Court in London on Tuesday. Armstrong had sought a divorce on the grounds of adultery. Judge Alun Jenkins granted the couple a decree nisi in under 30 seconds at the court. 42-year-old McPartlinconfirmed the pair were splitting in Januaryafter 11 years of marriage. Court documents indicated the judge held that ""the respondent has committed adultery and that the petitioner finds it intolerable to live with the respondent."" McPartlin and 41-year-old Armstrong will now have to wait for a decree absolute - usually issued six weeks and one day following the granting of a decree nisi - to officially end the marriage. Hours after the divorce was granted, Armstrong appeared on BBC Two's Strictly: It Takes Two programme to give a make-up tutorial. Lisa shows off her make-up credentials on Strictly: It Takes Two In a pre-recorded element of Strictly Come Dancing's sister show on Tuesday, Armstrong - the show's head make-up artist - created a glamorous punk look for viewers to recreate at home. No reference was made made to McPartlin and Armstrong's divorce proceedings. The couple met in 1990 on a roadshow in Newcastle, when they were both aspiring pop stars. Armstrong was in a band named Deuce at the time. The couple were married at Cliveden House in Berkshire in 2006. They have no children. Last year McPartlin went into rehab after struggling with a painkiller addiction that stemmed from a knee operation in 2015. He has also had problems with alcohol and was banned from driving for 20 months in April after being caught more than twice the legal drink drive limit. McPartlin said the April court appearance was a ""turning point"" for him Following the incident, the presenter, who has worked alongside Declan Donnelly for nearly 25 years, announced he was reducing his TV commitments. It was confirmed earlier this year that he would not present the next series of I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! and would instead bereplaced by Holly Willoughby. McPartlin fined Â£86,000 for drink driving Fans wish Ant well as he stays off TV Donnelly also presented a number of episodes of Saturday Night Takeaway without McPartlin in April after his drink-driving conviction.

"Bill Turnbull has described dealing with cancer every day as ""relentlessly boring"" and admitted he asked doctors to stop his ""unbearable"" chemotherapy. The former BBC Breakfast anchor, who's now a presenter on Classic FM, said: ""I just couldn't bear it any longer."" After that round of chemo in July - his eighth - he went on to have one more. Turnbull said he coped with the ""bad phases"" of chemo by watching ""lots"" of TV, including all 67 episodes of Game of Thrones. The broadcaster, who was diagnosed with incurable prostate cancer in November 2017, toldRadio Times,externalhe does not see himself as courageous for talking about cancer. But he said he was glad doing so had raised awareness of the condition. What can men do if they are worried about prostate cancer? Cutting prostate cancer diagnosis times He told the magazine: ""It's the fact that having cancer is so relentlessly boring. You go to bed at night thinking about it, and it's still there when you wake up. ""It's there all day, every day - a fact of life you have to get used to. And it's a massive pain in the backside."" This video can not be played Turnbull gives an update on his cancer treatment Turnbull, whose cancer has spread to the bone - across his pelvis, hips, legs and spine - said of chemo: ""Each round felt worse."" He lost his sense of taste, and some days could only cope by lying down to wait ""for the feeling of crushing fatigue and nausea to pass"". By round six, ""it felt as if the chemo was now taking on a life of its own, like some malevolent gremlin"". As well as watching TV, he said he coped by presenting his radio show and listening to music. Bill Turnbull presented BBC Breakfast alongside Susanna Reid Speaking of his decision to go public about his diagnosis, which he did in March, Turnbull said he wanted ""to show men it could happen to anyone"". He told the magazine. ""I'd had my prostate checked when I was 40, and again when I was 50. I thought that had put me in the clear, but it didn't. ""There were no early warning signs, and by the time I felt anything, it was too late."" He said people had got in touch to say they had gone to get checked as a result of Turnbull's experience, adding: ""It doesn't make everything worthwhile, but it certainly helps to know that someone will stay alive as a result of my experience. ""It's gratifying, then, to see the head of the NHS, Simon Stevens, confirming that more men are coming forward and being treatedas a result of the experiences of Stephen Fry and me."" Stephen Fry also underwent treatment for prostate cancer earlier this year He said it had not taken courage to declare he had cancer, but praised BBC journalist Rachael Bland for her podcasts and blogs about breast cancer before she died at the age of 40. ""That, my friends, was courage indeed,"" he said. Turnbull said the disease has stopped spreading but ""hasn't been beaten back entirely"", adding: ""We're at a stalemate."" He said: ""I'm still optimistic about hanging around for some time yet."" Turnbull says he is at a ""stalemate"" There can be fewsymptoms of prostate cancer,externalin the early stages, and because of its location most symptoms are linked to urination: needing to urinate more often, especially at night needing to run to the toilet difficulty in starting to urinate weak urine flow or taking a long time while urinating feeling your bladder has not emptied fully Men with male relatives who have had prostate cancer, black men and men over 50 are at higher risk of getting the disease.

"This morning: MPs questioned environment ministers Followed by: Urgent question on sickness benefit underpayments Exchanges over 'meaningful' Brexit vote for MPs dominate business statement Later: Debates on supermarket supply chains and World Menopause Day House of Lords debated cyber security and music education Sophie Morris, Robbie Hawkins and Ryan Brown ESA Underpayments Statement Repeat House of LordsParliament Peers are now responding to the repeated statement on ESA underpayments, which is being read by Work and Pensions Minister Baroness Buscome. Itemerged yesterdaythat tens of thousands of people on sickness benefits will receive backdated payments averaging Â£5,000 following government errors. In response to Labour spokesperson Baroness Sherlock's questions regarding compensation, Baroness Buscome says it is important to ""make clear"" that ""no one saw a cash reduction when they transferred to ESA, this is about extra money they may have been entitled to"". ""The key lesson we're learning is that it's a mistake to try to prepopulate information without being in touch with claimants,"" she adds. Following this, the Lords adjourn. Debate on Music Education in Schools House of LordsParliament Conservative peer Lord Black of Brentwood sums up the debate, telling peers he fears that ""the government is in denial, which is extremely sad"". Lord Black says the government ""must listen to the facts, and what is really going on the ground, and then act"". Peers are now hearing the repeat of an urgent question in the Commons earlier about sickness benefit underpayments. Debate on Music Education in Schools Education Minister Lord Agnew says music is a statutory part of the national curriculum, so all students in school aged 5 to 14 ""must study the subject"". He says between 2016 and 2020 the government is providing Â£300m for 120 music education hubs so all students can learn a musical instrument. He adds that a plan setting out the priorities for music education will be revealed by ministers ""in the coming months"". He denies that the English Baccalaureate is responsible for forcing music ""out of the curriculum"", and says the number of pupils taking music qualifications has been ""stable since 2010"". The debate on World Menopause Day comes to an end, and with it our coverage from the House of Commons for today. The day began with questions to environment ministers, followed by an urgent question on underpayments to tens of thousands of people on sickness benefits. It wasannounced yesterdaythat the government will now pay Â£1.5bn in back payments to correct errors made when people were moved onto Employment and Support Allowance (ESA). Pensions Minister Sarah Newton prompted shouts from the opposition benches when she claimed ""good housekeeping"" at her department had led to the problem being spotted. Then Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom revealed the Offensive Weapons Bill will return to the Commons on Monday, during her business statement to MPs. She also responded to a series of concerns raised by MPs regarding a ""meaningful vote"" on the final Brexit deal. Debate on Music Education in Schools House of LordsParliament Labour education spokesman Lord Watson of Invergowrie says it is ""inevitable"" that schools will have to cut back on teaching music, as the money given to local authorities is ""continuously cut"". He says the government is ""in denial about the declining number of students taking Music GCSE year on year"". The English Baccalaureate is ""detrimental"" to arts subjects, he says, and the government's claim that there is no less emphasis on the arts ""does not stack up"". He says ""too many schools lack the time, resources and expertise"" to deliver sufficient music education, and the government ""must support these schools"". Lord Watson says Labour would introduce an arts pupil premium to ensure arts facilities in state schools match those in the private sector. He asks whether ministers ""are content to music to remain for the wealthy"", as he says this is ""what is currently happening"". Debate on Music Education in Schools House of LordsParliament Lord Storey says although music is part of the national curriculum, fewer schools follow it because they have turned into academies. This means there is ""no real pressure on schools to teach music"", he adds. He blames this on ""a combination of austerity, narrowing of the curriculum and a focus on exam results rather than the quality of education experience"". He says the school where he was a headteacher in a deprived part of Liverpool had a full-time music teacher, which was ""life changing for those pupils"". ""Every child must have a rich education,"" he says. Debate on Music Education in Schools House of LordsParliament Labour peer Baroness McIntosh of Hudnall says says she agrees with all statements that have been raised in this debate. She says the government has been ""too restrictive"" in trying to implement a ""good standard of education"". She argues that the English Baccalaureate accountability measures ""are too narrow"". Universities in the Russell Group ""have given the impression to schools that arts subjects are not strong enough subjects for getting into university"", she says. Debate on Music Education in Schools House of LordsParliament Tory peer Lord Borwick says technology is expanding the possibilities of music teaching, pointing out that the quality of listening technology for iPhones and iPads is ""improving rapidly."" This will lead to mobile teaching and ""inevitably lead to the reduction in cost"", he says. ""What an inspiring future is coming our way. I'm much more optimistic"", he adds. New software needs to be developed for this, he says, suggesting it is important students are taught ""the skills for the future"", and this opens up music for those who lack ability or aptitude. World Menopause Day Debate House of CommonsParliament Responding to the debate, Communities Minister Nigel Adams says the ""inconsistent levels of awareness"" about the menopause reflects ""a history of stigma"". He says he agrees that it is important that education about the menopause is improved. With an ageing workforce, he adds that positive action by employers will benefit productivity and retention. ""One in four women in the workplace are going through or have gone through the menopause"", he adds. He concludes that it is essential that all employers and healthcare professionals are ""fully informed"" about providing treatment and support. Debate on Music Education in Schools House of LordsParliament Liberal Democrat Lord Wallace of Saltaire says having fewer music teacher vacancies is not something to celebrate. ""That's because there are fewer posts to appoint teachers to"", he adds. ""To neglect this dimension of education in order to cut taxes and public spending, would be as irrational as cutting spending on the police whilst claiming to support the principles of private property."" Debate on Music Education in Schools House of LordsParliament Conservative Lord Lexden, who is president of the Independent Schools Association, says music is ""one of the great strengths of the independent sector of education"". ""I draw attention to this state of affairs, not in any spirit of self congratulations,"" he says, but to point out that independent schools can assist state schools with resources. He says state and private schools are collaborating to a ""greater extent than ever before"" on music education, with independent schools being ""actively encouraged"" to share resources. But he says ""success will only be achieved when state and independent schools come together by their own free will"". World Menopause Day Debate House of CommonsParliament Shadow women and equalities minister Carolyn Harris welcomes every man in the chamber to the ""sisterhood"". She tells MPs that ""for too long the menopause has been...the punchline of a joke that is actually anything but funny"". Many women, she adds, are ""completely unprepared for this phase of their lives"". She calls for education for girls and boys on the menopause. She asks if the Department for Education would consider extending sexual health education guidance. Carolyn Harris also criticises the limited training given to doctors on the menopause, and its misdiagnosis as depression. She concludes by calling for a mandatory menopause policy within workplaces. World Menopause Day Debate House of CommonsParliament The SNP's Marion Fellows jokes her daughter ""frequently accuses her of oversharing"" but adds: ""I've been there, I've done that, I've got the T-shirt"" She says she started early and the menopause felt like it went on for a long time. Ms Fellows says the menopause can have a psychological and physical impact on women and it is vital health professionals ""take them seriously"". The MP also says that it is ""not uncommon"" for women to experience sexual dysfunction during the menopause that can affect their relationships, self-confidence and mental health. Debate on Music Education in Schools House of LordsParliament The Earl of Clancarty, a crossbench peer, says the future of music and other arts is at stake, adding that it is ""getting a little frustrating, having to quote back to the department its own figures"". ""Music should not become the preserve of the rich,"" he says, but suggests this is the way things are going. He criticises the restrictions on accessibility to art subjects, with many schools only letting students study one arts subject, and 70% of secondary school music teachers being forced to also teach other subjects, which he calls ""a nonsense"". World Menopause Day Debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative Rachel Maclean calls the menopause ""one of the last taboos"". She tells MPs she is menopausal herself, and suffers from debilitating headaches. ""There is so much ignorance out there"", she says, adding that the menopause is ""not just hot flushes and night sweats"". ""This is not a women's issue"" she says, but ""a society issue"". Debate on Music Education in Schools House of LordsParliament Conservative peer and chairman of the English Schools Orchestra Lord Lingfield says the fact that fewer children are receiving education in playing musical instruments is ""a worrying trend"". He says the 800 secondary schools which still have orchestras should be praised, but more needs to be done to ensure the idea is ""encouraged in all schools"". ""There needs to be a national plan for music education,"" he says. Debate on Music Education in Schools House of LordsParliament Labour peer Lord Lipsey, who chairs a parliamentary group on classical music, says music graduates ""are very hard sought"" by employers, even outside of musical occupations. The discipline requires ""a tremendous amount of skill and focus"", he says. However, he adds that the value of music education has been ""overshadowed"" by a ""streamlined focus"" on science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) subjects. Liberal Democrat peer Lord Clement Jones says the Music GCSE should be available in all schools, and the arts must not become the ""preserve of students at private schools"". ""We cannot afford to lose music education from schools, and the government must ensure we protect the teaching of music by taking the focus off of the English Baccalaureate,"" he says. World Menopause Day Debate House of CommonsParliament The debate on supermarket supply chains comes to a close, and MPs begin their second backbench business debate of the afternoon, on World Menopause Day. Opening the debate, Labour MP Martin Whitfield says recent research found half of working women found work difficult due to the menopause, with 10% giving up work altogether. ""The menopause is an occupational health issue that rests on the desks of managers, male managers as well as female managers"", he says. He concludes by asking men to ""take up the challenge"" of discussing the menopause with those close to them at home and the workplace, so women do not ""suffer in silence"". Debate on Music Education in Schools House of LordsParliament Opening the debate, Lord Black of Brentwood says musical education is ""dying a rapid death"" and has become ""only an option for the privileged"". The gap in provision between state and private schools is ""shameful"", he adds. There has been a 40% decrease in the number of students taking A-Level Music in the last eight years, he says, adding that much of the blame ""must be placed on the English Baccalaureate"". The qualification, he tells peers, ""has harmed all creative arts subjects"". ""Music is not an add-on, it is not a past time, it is not a nice-to-have, it is an important grounding to our society and is as important as maths and physics,"" he says. Exploitation in Supermarket Supply Chains Debate House of CommonsParliament Home Office Minister Victoria Atkins says the government is determined to end modern slavery ""in our communities and in the global economy"". She adds that since the ""landmark""  Modern Slavery Act, there have been more convictions and arrests every year, with 950 currently live. Ms Atkins adds that this year the government will invest at least Â£61m towards end modern slavery in the UK and abroad. ""No production line, however how far reaching, should ever involve the exploitation of human beings"", she adds. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Police have recorded a surge in hate crime directed at people in England and Wales because of their religious beliefs. It rose by 40%, from 5,949 in 2016-17 to 8,336 in 2017-18, according to theHome Office data,external. Most religious hate crime - 52% of all offences - was aimed at Muslims. But the separate Crime Survey of England and Wales, which is a broader measure of people's experience of crime, showed no rise. According to Home Office data, the total number of hate incidents reached a record 94,098 from April 2017 to March 2018 - a rise of 17% from the previous year. Just over three-quarters of those - a total of 71,251 - were classified as ""race hate"". Hate crime is defined as an offence which the victim considers to be driven by hostility towards their race, religion, sexual orientation, disability or transgender identity. It can include verbal abuse, intimidation, threats, harassment, assault and bullying, as well as damage to property. The religions that police count hate crimes for are: Buddhist; Christian; Hindu; Jewish; Muslim and Sikh. They also have categories of ""no religion"", ""other"" and ""unknown"". Hostility to men and elderly could become hate crimes Police warned to do better on hate crime Defiant selfie of hate crime victim Crimes targeted at people because of their sexual orientation made up 12% of the total (11,638), with religious hatred at 9%, disability hate 8% (7,226) and transgender hate crimes 2% (1,651). According to the police figures, the number of hate crimes has more than doubled since 2012/13, when 42,255 were recorded. It is partly because of improvements in the way crimes are reported, but there have also been spikes of hate crime after events like the Brexit referendum and the terror attacks last year. People's experience of hate crime, captured in the Crime Survey of England and Wales, has gone down steadily in the last 10 years. The Home Office report said the large increases in police recorded hate crime ""may suggest that increases are due to the improvements made by the police into their identification and recording of hate crime offences and more people coming forward to report these crimes rather than a genuine increase"". And one quirk of the figures is that a single hate crime offence can be recorded more than once if it is deemed to have multiple motivations - for example, if an individual feels that they were targeted because of their race and their religion. Usman Ahmed, a Muslim, told the BBC he first experienced hate crime two years ago, when someone shouted abuse at him that referred to the Islamic State group. ""At first I was shocked and then confused as nothing like this had ever happened to me before,"" said the 19-year-old, from Luton. ""But the more I thought about it, the angrier I got. I kept thinking what had I done to deserve this?"" The Home Office has also announced a review into whether offences motivated by misandry - prejudice against men - should be classed as hate crimes. If so, it could lead to tougher sentences. Ageism and hatred of certain alternative cultures, such as Goths or punks, could also be included in future. Yvette Cooper, chairwoman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, welcomed the government's strategy but added: ""More action is needed, especially online."" It was also announced on Tuesday that despite the increase in recorded crime, the number of completed prosecutions fell from 14,480 in 2016/17 to 14,151 in 2017/18 - a drop of 329, or 2.3%. The Crown Prosecution Service said the conviction rate in hate crime cases was 84.7%, up from 83.4% the previous year. By Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondent Today's figures are the first official national count of the perceived religious target of a hate crime since ministers ordered all police forces to keep a tally. It  provides some real depth to a complex and little understood phenomenon. The number of offences targeted at Muslims or Jews was far greater than their respective proportions of the population of England and Wales. The detailed monthly figures also confirm what experts have long said - that moments of tension such as the 2016 Brexit vote, terrorism incidents or international crises trigger short-term ""spikes"" in hate. And the figures reveal that people who are targeted at home are twice as likely to be repeatedly victimised than those accosted in the street, because abusers will keep coming back. Police recorded 237 incidents where the perceived target religion was ""no religion"" at all. The Home Office told the BBC that it didn't know why some religious hate crimes had been recorded as ""no religion"" and that the figures were ""experimental"". Experts like Humanists UK say this group includes victims who have either left a faith, sparking a backlash from former co-believers, and those who had no faith in the first place. One element these figures simply don't cover is sectarianism - where one branch or sect of a faith targets another. While this is fully understood in Northern Ireland, it goes less noticed in the UK, despite the fact that it does happen. There is definitely evidence of tensions between some Sunni and Shia Muslims, the two traditions of Islam, and documented persecution of the separate small Ahmadiyya community, which is theologically rejected by others.

"Donald Tusk has poured cold water on hopes of a Brexit breakthrough at Wednesday's EU summit, saying the Irish border was still a sticking point. The European Council president said he had ""no grounds for optimism"" it would be solved at the summit. And he called on Theresa May to come up with ""concrete proposals"" to break the ""impasse"". The prime minister told her cabinet a deal was within reach if the government ""stand together and stand firm"". Asked if she would be coming forward with ""concrete proposals"" at the summit, Mrs May's official spokesman said: ""The prime minister set out her position yesterday (Monday). She looks forward to a face-to-face discussion with him tomorrow. ""There are many areas where we have made progress. More progress is needed on the backstop."" Katya Adler: Berlin's view of the Brexit breakdown DUP threat over Brexit backstop deal Q&A: The Irish border backstop Your guide to Brexit jargon The ""backstop"" is a fall back plan for avoiding a hard border in Ireland if the two sides can't strike a trade deal in time - but they can't agree on how long it should last and what form it should take. No new proposals are expected to be tabled or discussed this week and discussions are likely to continue at official level only. Mrs May had already put forward a ""workable solution"", Downing Street said. Speaking at a press conference in Brussels, Mr Tusk said: ""As I see it, the only source of hope for a deal for now is the goodwill and determination on both sides. ""However, for a breakthrough to take place besides goodwill we need new facts. ""Tomorrow (Wednesday), I am going to ask Prime Minister May whether she has concrete proposals on how to break the impasse."" This video can not be played Theresa May's Brexit update statement: ""The terms of our exit are now clear."" He urged Mrs May to present ""something creative enough"" to break the deadlock. He said EU leaders would discuss how to step up preparations for a ""no-deal scenario"", but stressed that did not mean they were not also making ""every effort to reach the best agreement possible for all sides"". Both sides in Brexit talks were hoping that a deal on the UK's withdrawal from the EU, including the Irish border question, would be agreed by mid-November in time for it to be ratified by EU members and for MPs at Westminster to vote on it. This video can not be played What will become of the Irish border when the UK leaves the European Union? The UK and the EU had hoped that enough progress would be made at Wednesday's EU council meeting to call a special summit in November to finalise the terms of the UK's exit. Asked if the November summit would still go ahead, Mr Tusk said: ""It's for the leaders to decide whether we need an extraordinary summit in November or not. ""Logistically, we are ready, but we need the feeling that we are close to a real breakthrough. The clock is ticking."" Downing Street said Mrs May has told cabinet ministers not to be ""downhearted"" if the European Council does not set a date for a November summit, amid growing expectation in government that any final agreement may be pushed back to December. The prime minister told a cabinet meeting on Tuesday morning she could not agree to any deal with the EU which created a new border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK - or one which locked the UK into a customs union with the EU indefinitely. She says this would be the consequence of the proposals currently on the table from the EU. The cabinet had discussed a ""mechanism"" that would avoid an indefinite customs union if a full trade deal cannot be agreed by the end of the 21-month transition period that is due to kick in after the UK leaves on 29 March - the so-called ""backstop"" plan. But it was ""not a decision-making cabinet"", Downing Street said. However, the EU is considering a proposal for a UK-wide temporary customs arrangement, Mrs May's spokesman added.

The prime minister told ministers progress had been made in Brexit talks on the ""future framework"" for trade and although there would be challenging moments ahead a deal with Brussels was within reach, Downing Street said. ""I am convinced that if we as a government stand together and stand firm we will achieve this,"" she said. Mrs May used Tuesday's cabinet to rally support for her position among senior ministers, amid reports eight of them had met on Monday to discuss their concerns about it. Downing Street said none of the eight - Dominic Raab, Jeremy Hunt, Michael Gove, Penny Mordaunt, Chris Grayling, Liz Truss, Andrea Leadsom and Geoffrey Cox - had threatened to quit at Tuesday's cabinet meeting and it was clear that she had strong support. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, who is travelling to Luxembourg to brief EU leaders ahead of Wednesday's summit, said he hoped a deal with Britain was possible ""in the coming weeks"". ""We are still not there. ""There are still several issues which remain unresolved, including that of Ireland, and therefore what I understand is that more time is required to find this comprehensive deal and to reach this decisive progress which we need in order to finalise these negotiations on the orderly exit of the United Kingdom.""

'Radical change' needed over Commons bullying Analysis: Dame Laura Cox's lightning strike Six things about John Bercow The report, by former high court judge Dame Laura Cox QC, said radical changes were needed in the way cases of bullying and harassment were dealt with in the House of Commons.

Sir Kevin, who stepped down on Monday after eight years in charge of the Commons Standards Committee, told the BBC: ""It's quite clear there has been a lack of leadership over a considerable part of time in term of the culture that makes... the Houses of Parliament, for some people, not a safe place to work, and I think the Speaker has responsibility for that."" Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mrs Miller said there was ""no option but root and branch change of management"".

Dame Laura was appointed in March aftera Newsnight investigationuncovered complaints about a number of MPs, including Mr Bercow - allegations which he denies. On Monday Dame Laura told the BBC Mr Bercow and other people in positions of leadership, such as the clerk of the House of Commons and the director general of the House of Commons, should read the report ""very carefully"". Senior figures, she said, needed to ask themselves ""do I understand that radical change is needed, can I deliver that and will the staff have confidence that I can deliver that change? ""If they can't answer 'yes' honestly to those questions they should each of them be considering their position."" In her report, she described the House of Commons as a ""stark reminder of how bad things used to be"" and said there was a culture of ""deference, subservience, acquiescence and silence"". A spokeswoman for Mr Bercow said it was ""a serious report into a serious subject which deserves a serious response"". Maria Miller said ""management change"" was needed in the House of Commons She added: ""The House of Commons Commission will meet as a matter of urgency in the coming days to consider the report and our response to it."" A separate ""review of of historical allegations"" is also under way, and in July MPs backed a new grievance procedure and behaviour code. The House of Commons executive board said the report made ""difficult reading"" and added that there was no place for bullying and harassment.

"The new system for dealing with misbehaviour by MPs is not good enough and the culture and management must change - the verdict from Dame Laura Cox, who was asked to look at how the House of Commons deals with bullying and sexual harassment, followingNewsnight's reporting on the subject. I suspect they were not expecting what they got. Thisreport,external, a response to the reports thatLucinda Day and I published in March, is uncompromising. Dame Laura, a former high court judge, found ""a culture, cascading from the top down, of deference, subservience, acquiescence and silence, in which bullying, harassment and sexual harassment have been able to thrive and have long been tolerated and concealed"". If the House management commissioned a report thinking that she would find that Newsnight had over-egged the problem, they will be sorely disappointed. She looked, as we did, at the treatment of the clerks - the apolitical staff who run the Commons and its committees. And she found, as we did, remarkable consistency in the accounts given by staff members about the problems in the House with bullying and harassment. She heard from 200 people about a place overwhelmed with culture of deference where victims feel guilty for their victimhood. MPs are a major part of the problem; she wrote: ""Some MPs were alleged to be ""serial offenders"" and there was said to be widespread and long-standing awareness internally of their behaviour. ""It is ...not possible to put a precise figure on the number of MPs who are alleged to have behaved in this way, but the accounts indicate that alleged bullying behaviour has been a more widespread problem than one limited to a few individuals. And, while some of the allegations relate to the past, others reveal that it continues to be a problem."" Bercow among MPs named in bullying claims Commons abuse 'tolerated and concealed' 'Behaviour code' could see MPs face sack Dame Laura also focuses on a problem that we heard much about, but reported on less. Alongside the problem with MPs, there is a problem with senior clerks. In an atmosphere where senior MPs are allowed to mistreat junior staff, grand clerks are protected by the same cultural tics and bureaucratic processes. So what now? There are some major conclusions she draws from her analysis of this dysfunctional workplace. She calls for a huge amount of change - after all, her analysis is that this is ""a culture that has actively sought to cover up such abusive conduct"". But she has some starting steps; necessary-but-not-sufficient conditions for what is needed: The new grievance processes should allow old claims to be reopened. At the moment, old cases cannot be raised under the House's new improved complaints process. This would permit investigation of John Bercow, Speaker of the House, who is accused of mistreating two of his private secretaries and would also re-open cases like those of Paul Farrelly, a Labour MP, who was the subject of an old process that Dame Laura regarded as insufficient. Both men deny bullying The process for determining complaints of bullying, harassment or sexual harassment should be ""an entirely independent process, in which MPs will play no part"" and the standards commissioner should be able to enforce as full a range of sanctions as possible. You can expect resistance on this from MPs, who have resisted any such oversight for years She also raises a change in administration saying: ""I find it difficult to envisage how the necessary changes can be successfully delivered, and the confidence of the staff restored, under the current senior House administration"". This, she defines as including clerk of the House Sir David Natzler and Mr Bercow. It is not clear how MPs will process this report. Mr Bercow has the votes to hang on. But some senior clerks may not survive this week. Deputy heads, as ever, are always likeliest to roll Dame Laura was commissioned to conduct an independent investigation. She delivered a thunderbolt.

"MPs and Lords could be sacked if new plans to deal with allegations of harassment and bullying are approved. The new Commons behaviour code published on Tuesday includes ""harsh punishments"" for those who do not meet parliamentary standards. A working group was set up in November to look into creating a grievance process after Westminster was hit with a string of scandals. The proposals will be voted on by MPs on Thursday. Two government ministers - Damian Green and Michael Fallon - resigned over scandals last year, and a number of other politicians on both sides of the House were  investigated over claims of sexual misconduct. A survey of more than 1,300 parliamentary workers published in February found that 19% had experienced or witnessed sexual harassment or inappropriate behaviour in the previous year, with twice as many complaints from women than men. Listen: Westminster Hour - BBC Radio 4 Is Westminster culture really changing? MPs' staff concern at anti-harassment plans Ms Leadsom said that at the moment, anyone with a complaint only has the choice of going to the press. She claimed the ""step by step"" plan recommended by the working group offers a more official path of grievance and will be ""entirely independent in every way"". If approved, two helplines would be created - one for bullying and harassment allegations, and a second specifically for sexual harassment or sexual violence. Mediation would be offered as a first step, if that is what the victim wanted, but the complaint could then move to a formal, independent investigation. Conservative MP Andrea Leadsom led the working group to look into a new process The Commissioner for Standards would have powers to deal out low levels of punishment - such as calling for an apology or insisting on compulsory training for the staff member involved. But if the complaint is more serious, it could then be passed to the committee of standards - made up of seven MPs and seven lay people - who would be able to vote on more serious sanctions, including sacking. The most serious sanctions would go to the Commons for a vote, and could lead to by-elections being called. The Members' and Peers' Staff Association said the plan was a ""robust and progressive way forward"". ""We hope that everyone both on the Parliamentary estate and in constituency offices will now fully engage with the new processes and that the bullying and harassment that we have seen will be eradicated to provide a safe and confident place for all staff to work,"" said its steering group representative Georgina Kester. But the BBC's political correspondent Eleanor Garnier said concerns had been raised by the FDA union that the new system will involve MPs making judgements on other MPs, in effect marking their own homework. There is also criticism about the system's focus on new accusations, with little scope for historic incidents to be investigated. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour on Sunday, Ms Leadsom said the new system would ""put the victim at the heart of it"". ""Anybody who works in, with or for Parliament, must be given the same access to an equal and fair system that gives them the satisfaction of final closure of their complaint,"" she said. Ms Leadsom said those with older complaints would be able to call for ""advice, guidance and support"" - but it would be difficult to gather evidence for past cases. However, she did say that the group would be establishing an independent review of historic allegations, which she hopes would help ""give [victims] closure"". She added that she had ""high hopes"" for the plans to be approved. Also speaking to the Westminster Hour, Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson said the plan seems like ""a step in the right direction"" - although he renewed calls for Parliament to recognise unions. He said it would ""probably"" get support from MPs, adding: ""The political parties have got to really tighten up their act on safeguarding and harassment."" Former International Development Secretary, Priti Patel, added: ""I came from a private sector career before and I think it's astonishing that we just do not have safeguards and the appropriate mechanisms in place. ""Parliament sounds like a very unattractive place to work when you hear these horrible stories so we need to take the right step forward, and clearly this is part of that.""

"Mr Pompeo thanked the king for his ""commitment"" to an investigation Pressure is growing on Saudi Arabia to explain the fate of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met King Salman in Riyadh. Mr Khashoggi was last seen at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul two weeks ago. Turkish officials believe Mr Khashoggi was murdered by Saudi agents but the Saudis have denied this. However, US media are reporting that the Saudis may be preparing to admit that Mr Khashoggi died as a result of an interrogation that went wrong. Overnight, Turkish police completed a search of the consulate after being admitted by Saudi authorities. Did Apple Watch record Khashoggi killing? Why Saudi Arabia matters to the West More firms pull out of Saudi business conference The secretary of state and the king have now met in Riyadh. While much of what was discussed has yet to be announced, the US State Department said that Mr Pompeo had used the time to thank the king for his ""commitment to a thorough, transparent investigation"" into Mr Khashoggi's disappearance. Mr Pompeo was also expected to seek further clarification over a conversation between the king and President Donald Trump on Monday. This video can not be played President Trump and the King of Saudi Arabia discussed the disappearance of the Saudi journalist Tweeting earlier about the call, Mr Trump said: ""Just spoke to the king of Saudi Arabia who denies any knowledge of whatever may have happened 'to our Saudi Arabian citizen'.""

There is a lot at stake given the strength of Saudi-US ties. Mr Trump has already ruled out cancelling a lucrative arms deal, althoughhe did threaten ""severe punishment""if the kingdom were found to be responsible for the death. King Salman ordered an investigation into the missing journalist on Monday. Saudi statements up to now havedismissed allegations of a killing as ""baseless"" and ""lies"". The kingdom has also angrily rejected what it called political and economic ""threats"",saying it would respond to any punitive action, such as sanctions, ""with a bigger one"". Mr Pompeo is also expected to meet Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman during his day in Riyadh. The secretary of state may then head to Turkey. It appeared in the New York Times and on CNN, quoting unnamed sources. They said Saudi Arabia would acknowledge that Mr Khashoggi's death was the result of an interrogation that went wrong and the intention had been only to abduct him from Turkey. Saudi UK envoy 'concerned' over Khashoggi Turkish press trail Khashoggi's last steps Saudi ties with West at risk over Khashoggi This may explain in part Mr Trump's ""rogue killers"" line. Who such killers could be and how it fits into reports of a Saudi team being despatched to the consulate before Mr Khashoggi's arrival will presumably need to covered. CNN said the Saudis may argue the operation was conducted without clearance,externaland those responsible would be held accountable. The Khashoggi family in Saudi Arabia issued a statement calling for an ""independent and impartial international commission"". By Frank Gardner, BBC News The recent, highly charged exchange of words between Washington and Riyadh now appears to have given way to a mutual search for the least bad explanation. Both countries' leaders know they have an enormous amount to lose if this affair ended up splitting apart their 73-year old strategic partnership. Iran, as the regional rival to Saudi Arabia, would be the prime beneficiary if the Saudis were to lose their defensive US umbrella. President Trump is also correct when he says thousands of US jobs would be lost, with China and Russia to be among those lining up to replace them. Which begs the wider question: is the West's relationship with Saudi Arabia so important that it outweighs the need to condemn and punish what many believe was a state-sponsored murder of a journalist inside a consulate? Hence the urgent dispatching of US Secretary of State for talks with the Saudi leadership. In private there may well be some strong words, in public both countries may want to present a united stand. But one thing is certain: whatever narrative emerges, the international reputation of the Saudi Crown Prince and power-behind-the-throne Mohammed Bin Salman will forever be tainted by this affair. Is this the end of Saudi prince's honeymoon? For the first time since the journalist disappeared on 2 October, Turkish investigators were allowed to enter the building. Turkish officers search the Saudi consulate in Istanbul A Saudi team entered first on Monday, followed roughly an hour later by Turkish forensic police. The Turkish investigators, some wearing overalls, gloves and covered shoes. stayed for about eight hours, leaving in the early hours of Tuesday. They reportedly took with them samples, including of soil from the consulate garden. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Saudi Arabia agreed last week to allow Turkish officials to conduct a search but insisted it would only be a superficial ""visual"" inspection. Turkey rejected that offer. The Sabah daily newspaper said investigators had wanted to search the building with luminol, a chemical which shows up any traces of blood. It is not clear whether that happened. Reports on Tuesday said Istanbul police would also search the Saudi consul's residence.

"This video can not be played Lucy's mother Stacey White spoke to the BBC in October last year The mother of a teenage girl who was found stabbed to death said she had experienced ""complete emptiness and disbelief"" since losing her daughter. Lucy McHugh, 13, was found dead in woodland near Southampton Sports Centre in July. Her mother Stacey White said she would keep her memory alive and stop her killer from destroying anyone else. An ""I Love Lucy Day"" to raise funds for a memorial garden will take place on Saturday. Ms White said her daughter was ""always full of smiles"". ""The biggest, smiling person in our lives has been taken and she's never going to come back,"" she said. This video can not be played Lucy McHugh was seen at Tesco Express half an hour after she left home Lucy was a keen music and sports fan, who had been involved in gymnastics, trampolining and majorettes. But her mother said she was also a girl with a mind set on a particular career path. ""She had come to a very strong decision that she wanted to study law and she then wanted that to lead her to moving to America,"" Ms White said. ""And then becoming a pro bono lawyer to help people who couldn't afford to help themselves."" Describing her life since Lucy passed away, she said: ""It's a complete emptiness overcoming you all at once. Your whole word falling apart. ""People can pick up text books, they can read them until they're blue in the face. It is not as it is written. It is such a more complex layer of sorrow and heartache and just destruction."" Lucy McHugh's body was found on 26 July - the schoolgirl went missing a day before However she said she had been forced to stay strong and ""survive"" for her other three children. ""You either allow it to destroy you or you fight. I'll fight. I won't let Lucy's memories die. I won't let her be forgotten. I won't let this destroy any more people than what it has already. ""I won't let whoever has done this destroy anybody else."" 'New lead' in stabbed teenager probe Memorial garden plan for killed teen Girl murder suspect jailed over password Hampshire Constabulary said officers were following a ""new line of inquiry"" following a new search in part of the sports centre ground earlier this month which had not previously been targeted.

"Wages excluding bonuses have risen at their fastest pace in nearly 10 years, official figures show. Pay rose by 3.1% in the three months to August, compared with a year ago, while inflation for the same period was 2.5%. Last week, Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane said he saw signs of a ""new dawn"" for wage growth. The latest official data also showed unemployment fell by 47,000 to 1.36 million in the three months to August. The jobless rate remained at 4%. David Freeman, the Office for National Statistic's (ONS) head of labour market, said: ""People's regular monthly wage packets grew at their strongest rate in almost a decade, but, allowing for inflation, the growth was much more subdued. ""The number of people in work remained at a near-record high, while the unemployment rate was at its lowest since the mid-1970s."" The ONS figures showed the number of people in work was little changed at 32.39 million, down by just 5,000. The average pace of wage growth was 4% before the global financial crisis. Economists have been puzzled why wages have grown so slowly even as unemployment has fallen sharply. Wages including bonuses rose at a pace of 2.7% in the three months to August. In August, the Bank of England said that it expected total pay to be growing at a rate of 2.5% a year by the end of 2018, climbing to 3.5% by the end of 2020. However, Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the latest wage growth rates were unlikely to be maintained. ""The recent pick-up in wage growth has been driven partly by the loosening of the public-sector pay cap for some workers,"" he said. ""For instance, most NHS workers received a pay rise of at least 3% in July. ""But the government still is keeping a tight lid on pay rises in other departments, while this year's increase in NHS pay is the best in a three-year deal. Public sector pay growth, therefore, likely has reached a ceiling. ""The recent upturn in wage growth also has been flattered by the recent rebound in average hours."" Andy Verity, economics correspondent Here's a reason to be cheerful. In the three months from June to August we had, on average, the biggest pay rise in nine years! But slow down. The fact that 3.1% is the biggest pay rise since February 2009 says more about how weak pay growth has been in the last decade than how strong it has been in the past year. Strip out the effect of inflation (as measured by the Consumer Prices Index) and you get pay growth of just 0.6%. Then look back at the last decade, the worst decade for living standards in 200 years. If you're a half-full person, well we're up by about Â£25 per week on average since the squeeze on living standards was at its tightest back in 2014. But if you're half-empty, we're still earning about Â£20 a week less than we did 10 years ago when the global financial crisis struck. The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) also said it did not expect this trend to continue. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the BCC, said: ""While wage growth increased again, the pace at which pay growth is exceeding price growth remains well below the historic average, meaning the current squeeze on spending power is unlikely to ease. ""Achieving a meaningful improvement in wage growth will be an uphill struggle unless the underlying issues that continue to limit pay settlements are tackled - notably sluggish productivity, considerable underemployment and high upfront costs for businesses.""

"This video can not be played The couple were given a toy kangaroo, complete with joey, and little Ugg boots The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have begun their first overseas tour as news of Meghan's pregnancy made headlines across the globe. The royal couple arrived in Sydney and were given the first of many gifts for their baby. Australia's Governor-General Sir Peter Cosgrove and his wife Lynne presented them with a toy kangaroo, complete with joey, as well as a little pair of Ugg boots. The baby is due in the spring. How not to upstage someone's wedding Which royal baby was the cutest of all? As well as Australia, the tour will see them visit New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga. Speaking in Sydney, Prince Harry said: ""Thank you for the incredibly warm welcome and the chance to meet so many Aussies from all walks of life. ""We also genuinely couldn't think of a better place to announce the upcoming baby, boy or girl."" The duke and duchess were greeted at Sydney's Admiralty House by flag-bearing representatives from the 18 countries who will be competing at the Invictus Games. Prince Harry is one of the founders of the competition for injured military personnel. Presented with the cuddly kangaroo, Meghan said: ""Our first baby gift!"" while Prince Harry described the boots as ""awesome"". The couple who married in May, were also given Akubras, traditional Australian hats. When the duchess - wearing a white dress by Australian designer Karen Gee - was congratulated on her pregnancy, she replied: ""Thank you so much. We are very excited."" Later Harry and Meghan visited Sydney's Taronga Zoo and were introduced to two joeys named after them to mark their marriage. Meghan remarked that the koalas were ""so, so sweet"". Thousands of people congregated around Sydney Opera House, where the couple took part in a walkabout. They were given soft toys, flowers and other gifts by well-wishers. Among them was 98-year-old Daphne Dunne, whom Harry picked out and greeted warmly. Her first husband, Lieutenant Albert Chowne, died in 1945 during fighting in Papua New Guinea and was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross, which Mrs Dunne was wearing when she first met Prince Harry in 2015. Meghan told her: ""I'm so glad I got to meet you. Harry has told me all about you and your special bond, it's so lovely you came to see us, thank you."" Speaking afterwards, Mrs Dunne said: ""It was lovely to meet the duchess, Meghan. Harry is a wonderful man and I'm so happy he had found happiness, they both deserve the absolute world together."" The duke and duchess's itinerary has not changed, despite pregnant women being advised against travelling to Fiji and Tonga because of the risk posed by the Zika virus.

"Donald Tusk has poured cold water on hopes of a Brexit breakthrough at Wednesday's EU summit, saying the Irish border was still a sticking point. The European Council president said he had ""no grounds for optimism"" it would be solved at the summit. And he called on Theresa May to come up with ""concrete proposals"" to break the ""impasse"". The prime minister told her cabinet a deal was within reach if the government ""stand together and stand firm"". Asked if she would be coming forward with ""concrete proposals"" at the summit, Mrs May's official spokesman said: ""The prime minister set out her position yesterday (Monday). She looks forward to a face-to-face discussion with him tomorrow. ""There are many areas where we have made progress. More progress is needed on the backstop."" Katya Adler: Berlin's view of the Brexit breakdown DUP threat over Brexit backstop deal Q&A: The Irish border backstop Your guide to Brexit jargon The ""backstop"" is a fall back plan for avoiding a hard border in Ireland if the two sides can't strike a trade deal in time - but they can't agree on how long it should last and what form it should take. No new proposals are expected to be tabled or discussed this week and discussions are likely to continue at official level only. Mrs May had already put forward a ""workable solution"", Downing Street said. Speaking at a press conference in Brussels, Mr Tusk said: ""As I see it, the only source of hope for a deal for now is the goodwill and determination on both sides. ""However, for a breakthrough to take place besides goodwill we need new facts. ""Tomorrow (Wednesday), I am going to ask Prime Minister May whether she has concrete proposals on how to break the impasse."" This video can not be played Theresa May's Brexit update statement: ""The terms of our exit are now clear."" He urged Mrs May to present ""something creative enough"" to break the deadlock. He said EU leaders would discuss how to step up preparations for a ""no-deal scenario"", but stressed that did not mean they were not also making ""every effort to reach the best agreement possible for all sides"". Both sides in Brexit talks were hoping that a deal on the UK's withdrawal from the EU, including the Irish border question, would be agreed by mid-November in time for it to be ratified by EU members and for MPs at Westminster to vote on it. This video can not be played What will become of the Irish border when the UK leaves the European Union? The UK and the EU had hoped that enough progress would be made at Wednesday's EU council meeting to call a special summit in November to finalise the terms of the UK's exit. Asked if the November summit would still go ahead, Mr Tusk said: ""It's for the leaders to decide whether we need an extraordinary summit in November or not. ""Logistically, we are ready, but we need the feeling that we are close to a real breakthrough. The clock is ticking."" Downing Street said Mrs May has told cabinet ministers not to be ""downhearted"" if the European Council does not set a date for a November summit, amid growing expectation in government that any final agreement may be pushed back to December. The prime minister told a cabinet meeting on Tuesday morning she could not agree to any deal with the EU which created a new border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK - or one which locked the UK into a customs union with the EU indefinitely. She says this would be the consequence of the proposals currently on the table from the EU. The cabinet had discussed a ""mechanism"" that would avoid an indefinite customs union if a full trade deal cannot be agreed by the end of the 21-month transition period that is due to kick in after the UK leaves on 29 March - the so-called ""backstop"" plan. But it was ""not a decision-making cabinet"", Downing Street said. However, the EU is considering a proposal for a UK-wide temporary customs arrangement, Mrs May's spokesman added.

The prime minister told ministers progress had been made in Brexit talks on the ""future framework"" for trade and although there would be challenging moments ahead a deal with Brussels was within reach, Downing Street said. ""I am convinced that if we as a government stand together and stand firm we will achieve this,"" she said. Mrs May used Tuesday's cabinet to rally support for her position among senior ministers, amid reports eight of them had met on Monday to discuss their concerns about it. Downing Street said none of the eight - Dominic Raab, Jeremy Hunt, Michael Gove, Penny Mordaunt, Chris Grayling, Liz Truss, Andrea Leadsom and Geoffrey Cox - had threatened to quit at Tuesday's cabinet meeting and it was clear that she had strong support. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, who is travelling to Luxembourg to brief EU leaders ahead of Wednesday's summit, said he hoped a deal with Britain was possible ""in the coming weeks"". ""We are still not there. ""There are still several issues which remain unresolved, including that of Ireland, and therefore what I understand is that more time is required to find this comprehensive deal and to reach this decisive progress which we need in order to finalise these negotiations on the orderly exit of the United Kingdom.""

"This video can not be played Germany's Europe minister: ""We are close"" to Brexit deal Compared to the searing heat of Westminster politics, Berlin, like Brussels, is choosing to appear rather more laid-back and breezy when talking about the current impasse in Brexit talks. Brexit negotiators haven't gone off in a huff (so the narrative goes) but rather into separate huddles to figure out if anyone has room for manoeuvre on the crucial Irish border issue. Time left for negotiations may be running out but there is still reason for optimism, I'm repeatedly told. Some EU diplomats even suggest the European Parliament could vote on a Brexit deal as late as March if necessary. Now, I don't know about you. But when someone looks at me rather too earnestly in the eye and tells me not to panic, my heart rate tends to increase rapidly and voilÃ , with perfect timing and characteristic deadpan understatement, Angela Merkel announced on Monday that sealing a divorce deal with the UK now indeed ""looks a bit more difficult again"". Chancellor Merkel has political worries of her own this week Um. Yes. It does. And underneath the (attempt at a) cool, calm veneer, the EU is certainly concerned. President of the European Council Donald Tusk admitted yesterday that the possibility of the UK leaving the EU without a deal in place is more likely now than ever before. This is why technical Brexit negotiators received orders to exit stage right on Sunday. Political decision-makers will dominate centre stage for the rest of the week. Theresa May meets Chancellor Merkel and other EU leaders for dinner on Wednesday night. Angela Merkel will at least be partially distracted by her own political upheaval at home but everyone including Frau Merkel will be praying this encounter with Theresa May goes rather more smoothly than their last meeting a few weeks ago in Salzburg. The EU's intended main message will be: We are friends, not enemies of the UK and we also want to strike a Brexit deal this autumn. Though not at any price. EU leaders are keenly aware of the political pressure the prime minister is under at home. On a personal level, they are sympathetic but when it comes to the Brexit crunch, Germany's Europe Minister Michael Roth told me the EU would not allow itself to be ""blackmailed"" into making concessions. Whether over the Irish border or the single market, he insisted, EU leaders would put the interest of European citizens first. That was their clear priority ahead of finalising a Brexit deal with the UK. When I challenged him, Mr Roth denied that Germany was taking a hard line in Brexit negotiations. Along with France, he said Germany wished for a close relationship with the UK in the future, working together in trade and in security terms but he also very much mirrored the frustration you find in political circles across the EU. He said the UK seemed to find it hard to accept this but the EU could not allow Britain to enjoy the best of both worlds: EU club membership while being a free agent on the outside. He said this had nothing to do with wanting to punish the UK but why, he asked, would the EU want to offer the UK an advantage over its own member states? Mr Roth also warned the UK not to wait around, expecting the EU to ""cave in"" over the Irish backstop  (that guarantee to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland). He said all 27 EU countries stood united behind member state Ireland. Not one nation, he said, was pushing for more concessions to made to the UK over the issue. When I suggested that Brexit impasses or delays might sometimes be a bit of a show of drama to help both sides and Theresa May in particular, Germany's Europe minister told me there was always an element of theatre in negotiations.

"The Democratic Unionist Party's deputy leader has threatened to paralyse the government's domestic agenda if Northern Ireland's place in the union is jeopardised by a Brexit deal. But, Nigel Dodds said his party would stop short of triggering a general election. He was speaking ahead of a key cabinet meeting in London. Theresa May is attempting to rally ministers behind her at the start of a critical 48 hours for Brexit. DUP 'not holding Conservatives to ransom' What is the 'backstop to the backstop'? Brexit and the 'battle for the union' On Monday, she told MPsan agreement with the EU was ""still achievable"" despite apparent deadlock over the issue of the Irish border. The DUP prop up Mrs May's governmentand the prime minister relies on their support in key votes as she does not have a majority in the House of Commons. The EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier told journalists on Tuesday that the EU and UK would work ""calmly and seriously"" in the coming weeks to reach an agreement which would not see a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. ""We need more time to find this deal... and to reach this decisive progress,"" he added. On Tuesday Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar said that the UK will not secure a withdrawal agreement unless there is a legally binding and operable backstop to ensure that there is no future hard border on the island of Ireland. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar Speaking in the DÃ¡il (Irish parliament), he said that has been his government's position, and that of the British government , and he has no intention of departing from it. ""All we are asking is that the United Kingdom honour the commitments that it has already made in black and white in the year gone by,"" he said. ""And I'm sure a country like the United Kingdom with its proud history would want to do no less than honour commitments that it made in black and white and in writing through the course of this year. Mr Varadkar added that he still thinks a no-deal scenario is ""unlikely"". 'Maintain the union' Mr Dodds told BBC's Newsnight that his party was ready to withdraw support for the government on key domestic legislation if there is any move to ""break up or fracture the union"". However,  his warning was described as ""profoundly undemocratic"" by a Conservative Party MP. Anna Soubry, who is pro-EU, also told BBC's Stephen Nolan Show that the DUP were a ""blooming nightmare"". Mr Dodds spoke out after he sought assurances from the prime minister at Westminster that Northern Ireland will not be left in the EU single market when the rest of the UK leaves as part of any backstop deal. The EU and the UK appear to be in deadlock over the issue of a so-called backstop for the Irish border The backstop is a safety netthat will apply to the border if a wider deal or technological solution cannot keep it as frictionless as it is currently. The UK rejected the EU's proposed backstop, which would see Northern Ireland staying in the customs union and large parts of the single market, and instead proposed a backstop which would keep the whole of the UK in the EU customs union for a limited period. Nigel Dodds told the BBC his party would ""not want to pull the plug on the government and allow Jeremy Corbyn into No 10"". However, he warned that the DUP ""can not support the government's domestic, financial, welfare and other legislation, which does not trigger the possibility of Jeremy Corbyn getting into No 10"". In what appeared to be a direct appeal to cabinet ministers due to meet the prime minister on Tuesday morning, he added: ""I would say to colleagues we do not want this."" ""We want to work with the Conservative and Unionist Party but if there was a suggestion that the union, our precious union as the prime minister describes it, would be broken up or fractured in any way by the Conservative Party, then we would have to say, 'how could we continue to implement your domestic agenda and your budgets?' ""We wouldn't push for a general election but there comes a point where you have to say enough is enough."" However, Anna Soubry branded Mr Dodds' comments ""shocking"". She accused the DUP of ""holding the rest of this country to ransom"" and said it was ""breathtakingly irresponsible"". The former minister added that while she found DUP MPs at Westminster ""perfectly nice people"" as individuals, they were a ""blooming nightmare"" when put together. ""They are, at the moment, not working in the interest of the UK nor in the interest of the majority of people in Northern Ireland,"" she said.

"Police have recorded a surge in hate crime directed at people in England and Wales because of their religious beliefs. It rose by 40%, from 5,949 in 2016-17 to 8,336 in 2017-18, according to theHome Office data,external. Most religious hate crime - 52% of all offences - was aimed at Muslims. But the separate Crime Survey of England and Wales, which is a broader measure of people's experience of crime, showed no rise. According to Home Office data, the total number of hate incidents reached a record 94,098 from April 2017 to March 2018 - a rise of 17% from the previous year. Just over three-quarters of those - a total of 71,251 - were classified as ""race hate"". Hate crime is defined as an offence which the victim considers to be driven by hostility towards their race, religion, sexual orientation, disability or transgender identity. It can include verbal abuse, intimidation, threats, harassment, assault and bullying, as well as damage to property. The religions that police count hate crimes for are: Buddhist; Christian; Hindu; Jewish; Muslim and Sikh. They also have categories of ""no religion"", ""other"" and ""unknown"". Hostility to men and elderly could become hate crimes Police warned to do better on hate crime Defiant selfie of hate crime victim Crimes targeted at people because of their sexual orientation made up 12% of the total (11,638), with religious hatred at 9%, disability hate 8% (7,226) and transgender hate crimes 2% (1,651). According to the police figures, the number of hate crimes has more than doubled since 2012/13, when 42,255 were recorded. It is partly because of improvements in the way crimes are reported, but there have also been spikes of hate crime after events like the Brexit referendum and the terror attacks last year. People's experience of hate crime, captured in the Crime Survey of England and Wales, has gone down steadily in the last 10 years. The Home Office report said the large increases in police recorded hate crime ""may suggest that increases are due to the improvements made by the police into their identification and recording of hate crime offences and more people coming forward to report these crimes rather than a genuine increase"". And one quirk of the figures is that a single hate crime offence can be recorded more than once if it is deemed to have multiple motivations - for example, if an individual feels that they were targeted because of their race and their religion. Usman Ahmed, a Muslim, told the BBC he first experienced hate crime two years ago, when someone shouted abuse at him that referred to the Islamic State group. ""At first I was shocked and then confused as nothing like this had ever happened to me before,"" said the 19-year-old, from Luton. ""But the more I thought about it, the angrier I got. I kept thinking what had I done to deserve this?"" The Home Office has also announced a review into whether offences motivated by misandry - prejudice against men - should be classed as hate crimes. If so, it could lead to tougher sentences. Ageism and hatred of certain alternative cultures, such as Goths or punks, could also be included in future. Yvette Cooper, chairwoman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, welcomed the government's strategy but added: ""More action is needed, especially online."" It was also announced on Tuesday that despite the increase in recorded crime, the number of completed prosecutions fell from 14,480 in 2016/17 to 14,151 in 2017/18 - a drop of 329, or 2.3%. The Crown Prosecution Service said the conviction rate in hate crime cases was 84.7%, up from 83.4% the previous year. By Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondent Today's figures are the first official national count of the perceived religious target of a hate crime since ministers ordered all police forces to keep a tally. It  provides some real depth to a complex and little understood phenomenon. The number of offences targeted at Muslims or Jews was far greater than their respective proportions of the population of England and Wales. The detailed monthly figures also confirm what experts have long said - that moments of tension such as the 2016 Brexit vote, terrorism incidents or international crises trigger short-term ""spikes"" in hate. And the figures reveal that people who are targeted at home are twice as likely to be repeatedly victimised than those accosted in the street, because abusers will keep coming back. Police recorded 237 incidents where the perceived target religion was ""no religion"" at all. The Home Office told the BBC that it didn't know why some religious hate crimes had been recorded as ""no religion"" and that the figures were ""experimental"". Experts like Humanists UK say this group includes victims who have either left a faith, sparking a backlash from former co-believers, and those who had no faith in the first place. One element these figures simply don't cover is sectarianism - where one branch or sect of a faith targets another. While this is fully understood in Northern Ireland, it goes less noticed in the UK, despite the fact that it does happen. There is definitely evidence of tensions between some Sunni and Shia Muslims, the two traditions of Islam, and documented persecution of the separate small Ahmadiyya community, which is theologically rejected by others.

"Sacha Romanovitch, the first woman to run a big City accountancy firm, is stepping down as chief executive of Grant Thornton. The firm said she would depart when her successor was chosen. The leadership style of Ms Romanovitch, who brought in changes such as profit-sharing for all staff, was criticised in a recent anonymous memo, which said she was pursuing a ""socialist agenda"". She was appointed as the firm's chief executive in 2015. The internal memo attacking Ms Romanovitch's leadership style was sent to several media organisations and claimed to speak for 15 partners or directors. It also accused her of ""misdirecting"" the firm, which it said was ""out of control"" and had ""no focus on profitability"". At the time in response,she told the Guardian:,external""A small cadre of partners will find it hard we are making decisions that will depress profits in the short term but will help profits in the long term. ""If profits get unhinged from purpose it might not hurt you now, but it will come back and bite you on the bum."" Ms Romanovitch, who also capped her own salary and spoke out on issues such as mental health in the workplace, reflected on her employee-friendly leadership style in a BBC interview in the summer. She revealed that her out of office email message during her holiday read:""I'm off with my family right now, back on 23 July. I'll be reading, diving and playing with my boys while they still want to play with me! ""My great team will be dealing with my emails while I'm off ensuring you get support from the right people to keep things moving."" At the time, Ms Romanovitch explained she wanted to make clear that people should have time to switch off from work. ""There is still so much that creates a sense of needing to work 24/7. My out of office is just one of those little things I do to signpost what I think should be the norm."" Ed Warner, chairman of Grant Thornton UK's partnership oversight board, said Ms Romanovitch had been ""an inspiring CEO attracting great people to our firm and what we stand for"". He added: ""Following discussions with Sacha, the board has agreed that a new CEO is the logical next step to create long-term sustainable profits for the firm. We are grateful for the innovative and inspiring work Sacha has done."" Listen to Ms Romanovitch discuss firms taking care of employees' mental health Grant Thornton fined Â£3m for misconduct over audits In her own statement, Ms Romanovitch, who joined the company in 1994, said: ""It has been a privilege and an honour to lead this firm. I am proud of what we have achieved in the market, with our people and with our clients, breaking the mould in so many ways. ""We have attracted so many talented people and great clients to our firm due to our purpose and what we stand for."" The 50-year-old added that she would help the company in its transition to new leadership before leaving. Last year, Ms Romanovitch received an approval rating of 88% from staff in a recruitment firm's survey of employees' top 50 chief executives. Earlier this month, Ms Romanovitch told the Times newspaper that she intended to stand for election for a second four-year term in office.

"The UK and the European Union are in talks about how they could live and work together after Brexit. Politicians use many different terms when discussing Brexit - here is what some of the key ones mean. Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button Britain's exit from the European Union. A period lasting from 31 January to 31 December 2020, when the UK is no longer a member of the EU, but still follows all its rules. It was agreed by the UK and the EU to allow both sides time to reach a deal on their future relationship. Trade between two countries, where neither side charges taxes or duties on goods crossing borders. A deal between countries to reduce, but not necessarily eliminate, trade barriers such as: Taxes that must be paid when trading Limits on how much of certain goods can be imported Rules on things such as hygiene or labelling of food How the agreement between the EU and the UK would be enforced if there is a dispute. One controversial issue has been about what role, if any, the European Court of Justice should play. A tax or duty to be paid on goods crossing borders. Rules on who can fish where, and how much of each species can be caught. A set of rules to ensure that one country, or group of countries, doesn't have an unfair advantage over another. This can involve areas such as workers' rights and environmental standards. Free trade agreements often include level playing field measures. EU laws which prevent a government in one country from supporting companies there - over competitors in another country. This support could be financial - for instance, allowing companies to borrow more cheaply, or charging them less in tax. The 2019 agreement which set out how the UK would leave the EU. It covered: Money the UK still has to pay the EU The rights of EU citizens who already live in the UK and UK citizens in the EU The Northern Ireland protocol is part of this agreement. It set out special arrangements for Northern Ireland, to avoid the need for checks along the Irish border. This will be the situation if the UK and the EU don't reach a trade agreement by the end of 2020. It means that both sides would have to charge tariffs - or taxes - on goods crossing borders. If countries don't have free-trade agreements, they usually trade with each other under what's called WTO (World Trade Organization) rules, where each country sets tariffs - or taxes - on goods entering, and applies them equally to all its trading partners. The government currently refers to this as an ""Australian-style deal"".

"Wages excluding bonuses have risen at their fastest pace in nearly 10 years, official figures show. Pay rose by 3.1% in the three months to August, compared with a year ago, while inflation for the same period was 2.5%. Last week, Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane said he saw signs of a ""new dawn"" for wage growth. The latest official data also showed unemployment fell by 47,000 to 1.36 million in the three months to August. The jobless rate remained at 4%. David Freeman, the Office for National Statistic's (ONS) head of labour market, said: ""People's regular monthly wage packets grew at their strongest rate in almost a decade, but, allowing for inflation, the growth was much more subdued. ""The number of people in work remained at a near-record high, while the unemployment rate was at its lowest since the mid-1970s."" The ONS figures showed the number of people in work was little changed at 32.39 million, down by just 5,000. The average pace of wage growth was 4% before the global financial crisis. Economists have been puzzled why wages have grown so slowly even as unemployment has fallen sharply. Wages including bonuses rose at a pace of 2.7% in the three months to August. In August, the Bank of England said that it expected total pay to be growing at a rate of 2.5% a year by the end of 2018, climbing to 3.5% by the end of 2020. However, Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the latest wage growth rates were unlikely to be maintained. ""The recent pick-up in wage growth has been driven partly by the loosening of the public-sector pay cap for some workers,"" he said. ""For instance, most NHS workers received a pay rise of at least 3% in July. ""But the government still is keeping a tight lid on pay rises in other departments, while this year's increase in NHS pay is the best in a three-year deal. Public sector pay growth, therefore, likely has reached a ceiling. ""The recent upturn in wage growth also has been flattered by the recent rebound in average hours."" Andy Verity, economics correspondent Here's a reason to be cheerful. In the three months from June to August we had, on average, the biggest pay rise in nine years! But slow down. The fact that 3.1% is the biggest pay rise since February 2009 says more about how weak pay growth has been in the last decade than how strong it has been in the past year. Strip out the effect of inflation (as measured by the Consumer Prices Index) and you get pay growth of just 0.6%. Then look back at the last decade, the worst decade for living standards in 200 years. If you're a half-full person, well we're up by about Â£25 per week on average since the squeeze on living standards was at its tightest back in 2014. But if you're half-empty, we're still earning about Â£20 a week less than we did 10 years ago when the global financial crisis struck. The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) also said it did not expect this trend to continue. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the BCC, said: ""While wage growth increased again, the pace at which pay growth is exceeding price growth remains well below the historic average, meaning the current squeeze on spending power is unlikely to ease. ""Achieving a meaningful improvement in wage growth will be an uphill struggle unless the underlying issues that continue to limit pay settlements are tackled - notably sluggish productivity, considerable underemployment and high upfront costs for businesses.""

"Daniel Craig and his wife Rachel Weisz have a baby daughter TV presenter Piers Morgan has questioned James Bond star Daniel Craig's masculinity for wearing a baby carrier - comments which have left many people less than impressed.

He wrote: ""Oh 007.. not you as well?!!! #papoose #emasculatedBond"". His comments about the 50-year-old actor, whose daughter is a few weeks old, prompted thousands of responses with many criticising Morgan's view of manhood. Allow Twitter content?

"Sacha Romanovitch, the first woman to run a big City accountancy firm, is stepping down as chief executive of Grant Thornton. The firm said she would depart when her successor was chosen. The leadership style of Ms Romanovitch, who brought in changes such as profit-sharing for all staff, was criticised in a recent anonymous memo, which said she was pursuing a ""socialist agenda"". She was appointed as the firm's chief executive in 2015. The internal memo attacking Ms Romanovitch's leadership style was sent to several media organisations and claimed to speak for 15 partners or directors. It also accused her of ""misdirecting"" the firm, which it said was ""out of control"" and had ""no focus on profitability"". At the time in response,she told the Guardian:,external""A small cadre of partners will find it hard we are making decisions that will depress profits in the short term but will help profits in the long term. ""If profits get unhinged from purpose it might not hurt you now, but it will come back and bite you on the bum."" Ms Romanovitch, who also capped her own salary and spoke out on issues such as mental health in the workplace, reflected on her employee-friendly leadership style in a BBC interview in the summer. She revealed that her out of office email message during her holiday read:""I'm off with my family right now, back on 23 July. I'll be reading, diving and playing with my boys while they still want to play with me! ""My great team will be dealing with my emails while I'm off ensuring you get support from the right people to keep things moving."" At the time, Ms Romanovitch explained she wanted to make clear that people should have time to switch off from work. ""There is still so much that creates a sense of needing to work 24/7. My out of office is just one of those little things I do to signpost what I think should be the norm."" Ed Warner, chairman of Grant Thornton UK's partnership oversight board, said Ms Romanovitch had been ""an inspiring CEO attracting great people to our firm and what we stand for"". He added: ""Following discussions with Sacha, the board has agreed that a new CEO is the logical next step to create long-term sustainable profits for the firm. We are grateful for the innovative and inspiring work Sacha has done."" Listen to Ms Romanovitch discuss firms taking care of employees' mental health Grant Thornton fined Â£3m for misconduct over audits In her own statement, Ms Romanovitch, who joined the company in 1994, said: ""It has been a privilege and an honour to lead this firm. I am proud of what we have achieved in the market, with our people and with our clients, breaking the mould in so many ways. ""We have attracted so many talented people and great clients to our firm due to our purpose and what we stand for."" The 50-year-old added that she would help the company in its transition to new leadership before leaving. Last year, Ms Romanovitch received an approval rating of 88% from staff in a recruitment firm's survey of employees' top 50 chief executives. Earlier this month, Ms Romanovitch told the Times newspaper that she intended to stand for election for a second four-year term in office. Grant Thornton audits Patisserie Valerie, which nearly folded last week. On Thursday, the cafe chain announced thatits board had found ""a material shortfall between the reported financial status and the current financial status of the business"".

"This video can not be played Scottish Power to use 100% wind power Scottish Power will become the first major UK energy company to generate all its electricity from wind power instead of coal and gas, after selling its final gas and hydro stations to Drax. Power company Drax has paid Â£702m for the rest of Scottish Power's conventional generation business. Scottish Power plans to invest Â£5.2bn over four years to more than double its renewables capacity. Chief executive Keith Anderson said it was a ""pivotal shift"" for the firm. ""We are leaving carbon generation behind for a renewable future powered by cheaper green energy. We have closed coal, sold gas and built enough wind to power 1.2 million homes,"" he said. However, the move does not mean Scottish Power customers will only be using electricity generated by wind turbines, as producers using other types of power generation all feed the UK grid. Scottish Power to raise energy prices Scottish Power loses 100,000 domestic customers Scottish Power has closed all of its coal plants in the past decade and has 2,700 megawatts (MW) of wind power capacity operating or under construction in the UK. It also has projects planned that can generate more than 3,000 MW. Its four-year plan aims to make electricity ""cleaner and cheaper for Britain"". Ignacio Galan, chairman of Scottish Power's Spanish owner, Iberdrola, said energy companies needed to be part of the solution to climate change. ""Iberdrola is acting now to cut carbon emissions 30% by 2020 and be carbon neutral by 2050. The sale of these generation assets is consistent with our strategy,"" he said. Drax chief executive Will Gardiner said: ""We believe there is a compelling logic in our move to add further flexible sources of power to our offering."" Drax runs the UK's biggest power plant near Selby in North Yorkshire and is moving away from coal ahead of a government deadline for an emissions limit on coal plants from 2025. It has already converted four of its six generating units to burn wood pellets. The Selby plant is believed to be the first bioenergy carbon capture storage (Beccs) project of its type in Europe. The power station has previously been criticised for the levels of air pollution it produces by campaigners,who claim it produces ""dangerous"" levels of air pollution. Drax said its emissions were ""well within statutory limits"". Drax has produced diagrams illustrating its CO2 capture scheme In May,it announced a Â£400,000 pilot scheme to capture the carbon dioxide produced from burning the wood pellets. It said that if this pilot were to lead to a full roll-out, it would achieve what it called the ""holy grail"" of power generation. It planned to work with energy firm C-Capture, which is connected to the chemistry department at the University of Leeds. Kate Blagojevic, UK head of energy at Greenpeace, said: ""Big utilities across Europe have been shedding their dirty fossil fuel infrastructure because it makes economic and environmental sense. This move by Scottish Power shows that the same maths adds up in the UK too. ""Climate science could not be clearer that renewables are the future for powering our world. We need the government to give renewable energy industry its full backing rather than propping up the fossil fuel and nuclear companies.""

"Bill Turnbull has described dealing with cancer every day as ""relentlessly boring"" and admitted he asked doctors to stop his ""unbearable"" chemotherapy. The former BBC Breakfast anchor, who's now a presenter on Classic FM, said: ""I just couldn't bear it any longer."" After that round of chemo in July - his eighth - he went on to have one more. Turnbull said he coped with the ""bad phases"" of chemo by watching ""lots"" of TV, including all 67 episodes of Game of Thrones. The broadcaster, who was diagnosed with incurable prostate cancer in November 2017, toldRadio Times,externalhe does not see himself as courageous for talking about cancer. But he said he was glad doing so had raised awareness of the condition. What can men do if they are worried about prostate cancer? Cutting prostate cancer diagnosis times He told the magazine: ""It's the fact that having cancer is so relentlessly boring. You go to bed at night thinking about it, and it's still there when you wake up. ""It's there all day, every day - a fact of life you have to get used to. And it's a massive pain in the backside."" This video can not be played Turnbull gives an update on his cancer treatment Turnbull, whose cancer has spread to the bone - across his pelvis, hips, legs and spine - said of chemo: ""Each round felt worse."" He lost his sense of taste, and some days could only cope by lying down to wait ""for the feeling of crushing fatigue and nausea to pass"". By round six, ""it felt as if the chemo was now taking on a life of its own, like some malevolent gremlin"". As well as watching TV, he said he coped by presenting his radio show and listening to music. Bill Turnbull presented BBC Breakfast alongside Susanna Reid Speaking of his decision to go public about his diagnosis, which he did in March, Turnbull said he wanted ""to show men it could happen to anyone"". He told the magazine. ""I'd had my prostate checked when I was 40, and again when I was 50. I thought that had put me in the clear, but it didn't. ""There were no early warning signs, and by the time I felt anything, it was too late."" He said people had got in touch to say they had gone to get checked as a result of Turnbull's experience, adding: ""It doesn't make everything worthwhile, but it certainly helps to know that someone will stay alive as a result of my experience. ""It's gratifying, then, to see the head of the NHS, Simon Stevens, confirming that more men are coming forward and being treatedas a result of the experiences of Stephen Fry and me."" Stephen Fry also underwent treatment for prostate cancer earlier this year He said it had not taken courage to declare he had cancer, but praised BBC journalist Rachael Bland for her podcasts and blogs about breast cancer before she died at the age of 40. ""That, my friends, was courage indeed,"" he said. Turnbull said the disease has stopped spreading but ""hasn't been beaten back entirely"", adding: ""We're at a stalemate."" He said: ""I'm still optimistic about hanging around for some time yet."" Turnbull says he is at a ""stalemate"" There can be fewsymptoms of prostate cancer,externalin the early stages, and because of its location most symptoms are linked to urination: needing to urinate more often, especially at night needing to run to the toilet difficulty in starting to urinate weak urine flow or taking a long time while urinating feeling your bladder has not emptied fully Men with male relatives who have had prostate cancer, black men and men over 50 are at higher risk of getting the disease.

"Prison officers are three times as likely to be be sexually assaulted by a prisoner than they were in 2010, according to new figures The number of prisoners being sexually assaulted by other inmates has trebled since 2010, the BBC has found. The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) found sexual assaults by prisoners increased from 92 in 2010 to 275 in 2017. The Prison Governors Association said the ""phenomenal"" increase in assaults was due to the loss of experienced prison officers. The Prison Service said it was ""making sure that prison officers have the tools they need to do the job safely"". Figures obtained by a freedom of information request show the rate of sexual assaults against prisoners has also trebled. Doncaster HMP and Northumberland HMP both recorded 14 sexual assaults committed by prisoners last year - equalling the previous record for most sexual assaults recorded by a prison. Frances Crook, chief executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform, said she feared the current figures are ""the tip of the iceberg"". Most sexual assaults in prisons go unreported, a recentstudy by the Howard League,externalreported. The study states: ""Men find it very difficult to talk about what has happened to them because of the common view that a man should be able to fight off an attacker."" The statistics also ""do not show how many prisoners have been sexually assaulted by staff, yet we are aware of high-profile cases of staff who have been dismissed or even jailed,"" Ms Crook said. A study by the MoJ,externalfound that sexual assaults in prisons had increased disproportionately when compared to all assaults reported in custody. Prisoners in jail for a sexual offence are disproportionately involved in sexual assault incidents as both assailants and victims. Reported sexual assaults also include incidents where drugs or other prohibited items are retrieved from a prisoner's anus or vagina - a practice known as ""prison spooning"". In these cases prisoners serving time for violent offences and robbery were more likely to be involved. A report by the Howard League suggested most sexual assaults in prisons go unreported These statistics provide the clearest evidence yet of an increase in sexual violence in prisons, alongside the well-documented problems of bullying, intimidation and assaults. The rise may be partly explained by more rigorous record-keeping - just as attacks on staff and prisoners are being more accurately logged than before. It may also be down to the greater willingness of victims to come forward, mirroring the increase in reporting more generally - the number of sexual offences recorded by police in England and Wales has nearly tripled since 2010. But there may also be a genuine rise in sexual assaults behind bars, a reflection in particular of the growing population in custody of sex offenders. It's an issue the prison authorities must grip quickly. Andrea Albutt, president of the Prison Governors Association, said: ""We can have CCTV and all these fancy things to make our prisons safe, but what makes our prisoners safe is good relationships. ""The way you become a really good prison officer is through experience. You have a lot of not confident, not competent prison officers in the system at the moment."" A Prison Service spokesperson said: ""All allegations of sexual assault and violence are taken extremely seriously. ""That's why we have doubled sentences for those who assault our staff and will work with police and the CPS to secure prosecutions wherever possible. ""Over the last two years we have recruited more than 3,500 additional prison officers and are spending an extra Â£40m on safety, security and the fabric of the prison estate.""

"Political groups have been spending increasing amounts of money on Facebook adverts From today, if you want to advertise a political cause on Facebook in the UK, you'll have to obey new rules. You will need to prove your identity and location to the company, and each ad will carry a message saying who paid for it. There will also be an online archive,external, showing all of your previous ads, roughly how much you spent, and who they have reached. The archive can be searched by anyone, whether or not they are a Facebook member. The new system has already been in operation in the US and Brazil. Facebook was forced to act following controversy about ads it displayed during the 2016 US Presidential election campaign and the UK's EU referendum. In the United States, thousands of ads were bought by Russian groups trying to sow discord. Facebook has been under pressure to make sure the same thing did not happen in the run-up to November's mid-term elections. Facebook stops sending staff to help political campaigns Vote Leave's targeted Brexit ads released by Facebook Electoral Commission demands social media transparency Facebook insists that Russian spending on ads during the Brexit campaign amounted to just Â£0.73, although the Department of Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee was unhappy with the level of information provided by the company. The tool reveals how many times an ad has been seen, how much was spent on it and a profile of its audience The first time anyone wants to place an advert that features political figures and parties, elections, legislation before Parliament and past referendums such as those involving Scottish independence or Brexit, they will go through a verification process to prove their identity and that they are based in the UK. They will have to provide a passport, a driving licence or a residence permit, and these will be checked by a third-party organisation. Searching the archive, you come across examples of ads that have been placed without the ""paid for by"" label. Facebook then shows this message: ""After the ad started running, we determined that the ad was related to politics and issues of national importance and required the label. The ad was taken down."" The system allows users to report a political ad as fake news, and if Facebook determines that it does contain falsehoods, it can be taken down. Adverts that have broken the rules remain in the archive, so that you can check just how many people it reached while it was on the site. The tool was introduced to Brazil in July ahead of the country's elections In a blog about the new policy, Facebook says that in the US and Brazil it is pleased with the progress made so far. But the company admits that it will not cut out abuse entirely. ""We're up against smart and well-funded adversaries who change their tactics as we spot abuse,"" it says. Last week,the social network removed more than 500 pages and 250 accountsit said were spamming users with what it called ""sensational political content"" to gain attention as the US mid-term elections approached. Facebook suggested the motives behind the material were financial rather than political, designed to get users clicking on adverts. The new rules will not necessarily show who has broken the UK's laws on election spending. The message that must be displayed on any ad will only show who paid Facebook for it, not where their money came from. That, says Facebook, would be a matter for the Electoral Commission to investigate. In July, the commission found that the Brexit campaign group Vote Leave had broken the law by funnelling money for Facebook ads through a youth group, BeLeave. Facebook says in future spending on adverts will be more visible. Facebook also intends to let third-parties develop their own software to search its archive ""The goal is to make it transparent, so that people can see that - not after the fact, but while the campaigning is going on,"" says Rob Leathern, the executive in charge of the initiative. In the US, the library has recorded over one million political ads since it launched in late May. Spending in the UK will presumably be pretty low for the time being - unless there is a snap election. But when a vote comes, we can expect Facebook's ad archive to become an essential tool - not just for the electorate but for parties trying to work out what their opponents are up to.

"Allen announced his diagnosis earlier this month Paul Allen, who co-founded Microsoft, has died aged 65 from complications of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. He had revealed the disease's return only two weeks ago, after previously being treated for it in 2009. He had said he and his doctors were ""optimistic"" about treatment. His Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates said: ""I am heartbroken by the passing of one of my oldest and dearest friends... Personal computing would not have existed without him."" In a statement confirming his death on Monday afternoon, his sister Jody described the businessman as a ""remarkable individual on every level"". ""Paul's family and friends were blessed to experience his wit, warmth, his generosity and deep concern. For all the demands on his schedule, there was always time for family and friends,"" the statement said. ""At this time of loss and grief for us - and so many others - we are profoundly grateful for the care and concern he demonstrated every day."" The businessman made his fortune alongside school friend Bill Gates, after they co-founded technology giant Microsoft in 1975. ""From our early days together at Lakeside School, through our partnership in the creation of Microsoft, to some of our joint philanthropic projects over the years, Paul was a true partner and dear friend,"" said Mr Gates. ""He deserved much more time, but his contributions to the world of technology and philanthropy will live on for generations to come. I will miss him tremendously."" He left the company in 1983 following his first diagnosis of the blood cancer Hodgkin's disease, but recovered to become a successful venture capitalist with his media and communications investment firm, Vulcan that he set up in 1986. Dave Lee, BBC North America technology reporter, San Francisco I've spent Monday at the 25th anniversary of technology magazine Wired, an event celebrating the history of not just the magazine, but technology itself. Paul Allen, who will be deeply missed by those here, was one of the industry's giants. His name would have been on Wired's pages many, many times. Mr Allen had beaten cancer before, and he had appeared confident that he could beat it again. Those close to him said he was active, on emails at least, until the very end - offering advice, strategy and insight to the many, many people who looked to him for support. Mr Allen didn't always have a great relationship with his co-founder, Bill Gates. The pair had a well-publicised row over stock ownership. But they shared an awful lot in common, first as children learning programming, and then as adults donating billions to philanthropic efforts. Mr Allen's investment firm confirmed news of his death on Monday evening. ""Millions of people were touched by his generosity, his persistence in pursuit of a better world, and his drive to accomplish as much as he could with the time and resources at his disposal,"" Vulcan CEO Bill Hilf said in a statement. He is estimated to have donated more than $2bn to philanthropy throughout his life,externalincluding science, education and wildlife conservation causes, the Associated Press report. He was also an avid sports fan, owning both the Portland Trail Blazers basketball team and Seattle Seahawks NFL team, who won the US Superbowl in 2013. In 2010 he pledged to give the majority of his fortune to charitable causes after his death.

"President Donald Trump denies the allegations made by Stormy Daniels US President Donald Trump has mocked porn actress Stormy Daniels in a tweet after a judge dismissed her defamation lawsuit against him. The judge ruled that a presidential tweet Ms Daniels said was defamatory was protected by the First Amendment, which guarantees freedom of speech. Mr Trump said he can now ""go after Horseface and her 3rd rate lawyer"". The ruling does not affect a separate lawsuit over hush money she says she was paid by Mr Trump's lawyer. Ms Daniels was also ordered to pay Mr Trump's legal fees, although the amount is yet to be determined. Her lawyer said she would appeal against the decision. Allow Twitter content?

In an interview with CBS News earlier this year, Ms Daniels said a stranger had approached her while she was with her young daughter, and had threatened her. She later issued an image of the man.

While the judge said this tweet was not defamatory, Ms Daniels' main suit against Mr Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, continues. 'I don't care if Trump paid off a porn star' In August, Mr Cohen pleaded guilty to violating campaign finance laws during the 2016 presidential election over payments to two women who said they had sexual relationships with Mr Trump.

"Hate crimes are offences motivated by prejudice against someone's disability, race, religion, sexual orientation or transgender identity. But should other so-called ""protected characteristics"" be included as well? Last month,it was announced that a review by the Law Commissionwould look at whether offences driven by misogyny - dislike, contempt or ingrained prejudice against women - should be treated as hate crimes. And now it's emerged the same review will also consider the opposite - crimes motivated by misandry - hostility towards men. Ageism and hatred of certain alternative cultures, such as Goths or punks, could also be included in future. The Law Commission - an independent body that looks regularly at laws and whether they need to be updated - began its review of hate crime following a campaign by the Labour MP Stella Creasy. She wanted misogyny to be recognised in the same way as racial or religious hatred because of the high levels of harassment that girls and women suffer. As for why hostility against men is being included too, Home Office Minister Baroness Williams says the government always responds to what ""the public and other organisations are telling us"". And it appears at least some feel misandry is an issue. She said the government wasn't telling the Law Commission to recommend that misandry be included, but was simply asking for its view on the matter. ""It may well be that particular strand is not necessary to take forward, but we are asking them to look at it,"" she added. Hate crimes include verbal abuse, physical violence and offences against property, like graffiti or arson. They're known as aggravated offences, meaning they can attract longer prison sentences than similar crimes not motivated by hate. Those stiffer penalties reflect the fact that hate crimes not only affect individual victims, but spread fear among the group to which the victim belongs. Police warned to do better on hate crime Charity staff trained to spot hate crimes Defiant selfie of hate crime victim However, the BBC's home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw says widening the definition could lead to a feeling that the impact of such offences is trivialised or minimised because there are so many different categories. It also runs the risk, he points out, of sentence inflation because many crimes currently treated as public order offences would be reclassified as more serious - and so would attract longer jail terms. Last year, the number of hate crimes in England and Wales was at a record high - more than 83,000. All the indications point to a further significant increase this year - figures will be released on Tuesday morning - though some of the rise is because victims are more willing to report what's happened. The charity Action on Elder Abuse said the inclusion of ageism as a motivation for hate crime was long overdue given the scale of the problem. ""The number of convictions for these crimes is tiny and, even when someone is found guilty, they often escape with flimsy sentences and paltry fines that do nothing to deter would-be abusers,"" chief executive Gary FitzGerald said. The government wants more people who witness hate crimes to recognise them as such and then report them. So, it's pinpointing several groups it thinks are more likely then average to become witnesses. Taxi drivers are one. Door staff are another. The latter will also be given guidance on how to ensure transgender people have a safe and enjoyable night when they visit pubs, clubs, events and festivals. Home Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""Hate crime goes directly against the long-standing British values of unity, tolerance and mutual respect - and I am committed to stamping this sickening behaviour out.""

"Mr Pompeo thanked the king for his ""commitment"" to an investigation Pressure is growing on Saudi Arabia to explain the fate of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met King Salman in Riyadh. Mr Khashoggi was last seen at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul two weeks ago. Turkish officials believe Mr Khashoggi was murdered by Saudi agents but the Saudis have denied this. However, US media are reporting that the Saudis may be preparing to admit that Mr Khashoggi died as a result of an interrogation that went wrong. Overnight, Turkish police completed a search of the consulate after being admitted by Saudi authorities. Did Apple Watch record Khashoggi killing? Why Saudi Arabia matters to the West More firms pull out of Saudi business conference The secretary of state and the king have now met in Riyadh. While much of what was discussed has yet to be announced, the US State Department said that Mr Pompeo had used the time to thank the king for his ""commitment to a thorough, transparent investigation"" into Mr Khashoggi's disappearance. Mr Pompeo was also expected to seek further clarification over a conversation between the king and President Donald Trump on Monday.

There is a lot at stake given the strength of Saudi-US ties. Mr Trump has already ruled out cancelling a lucrative arms deal, althoughhe did threaten ""severe punishment""if the kingdom were found to be responsible for the death. King Salman ordered an investigation into the missing journalist on Monday. Saudi statements up to now havedismissed allegations of a killing as ""baseless"" and ""lies"". The kingdom has also angrily rejected what it called political and economic ""threats"",saying it would respond to any punitive action, such as sanctions, ""with a bigger one"". Mr Pompeo is also expected to meet Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman during his day in Riyadh. The secretary of state may then head to Turkey. It appeared in the New York Times and on CNN, quoting unnamed sources. They said Saudi Arabia would acknowledge that Mr Khashoggi's death was the result of an interrogation that went wrong and the intention had been only to abduct him from Turkey. Saudi UK envoy 'concerned' over Khashoggi Turkish press trail Khashoggi's last steps Saudi ties with West at risk over Khashoggi This may explain in part Mr Trump's ""rogue killers"" line. Who such killers could be and how it fits into reports of a Saudi team being despatched to the consulate before Mr Khashoggi's arrival will presumably need to covered. CNN said the Saudis may argue the operation was conducted without clearance,externaland those responsible would be held accountable. The Khashoggi family in Saudi Arabia issued a statement calling for an ""independent and impartial international commission"". By Frank Gardner, BBC News The recent, highly charged exchange of words between Washington and Riyadh now appears to have given way to a mutual search for the least bad explanation. Both countries' leaders know they have an enormous amount to lose if this affair ended up splitting apart their 73-year old strategic partnership. Iran, as the regional rival to Saudi Arabia, would be the prime beneficiary if the Saudis were to lose their defensive US umbrella. President Trump is also correct when he says thousands of US jobs would be lost, with China and Russia to be among those lining up to replace them. Which begs the wider question: is the West's relationship with Saudi Arabia so important that it outweighs the need to condemn and punish what many believe was a state-sponsored murder of a journalist inside a consulate? Hence the urgent dispatching of US Secretary of State for talks with the Saudi leadership. In private there may well be some strong words, in public both countries may want to present a united stand. But one thing is certain: whatever narrative emerges, the international reputation of the Saudi Crown Prince and power-behind-the-throne Mohammed Bin Salman will forever be tainted by this affair. Is this the end of Saudi prince's honeymoon? For the first time since the journalist disappeared on 2 October, Turkish investigators were allowed to enter the building. Turkish officers search the Saudi consulate in Istanbul A Saudi team entered first on Monday, followed roughly an hour later by Turkish forensic police. The Turkish investigators, some wearing overalls, gloves and covered shoes. stayed for about eight hours, leaving in the early hours of Tuesday.

If not, pledges to raise NHS spending by Â£20.5bn and ""balance the books"" by 2020, matching spending and taxation, were likely to be incompatible. The Treasury said its approach was to keep taxes as low as possible. A Treasury spokesperson said: ""Our balanced approach is getting debt falling and supporting our vital public services, while keeping taxes as low as possible. This year, we have already committed an extra Â£20.5bn a year to the NHS, scrapped the public sector pay cap, and frozen fuel duty for the ninth year in a row."" ""The government seems to have made two incompatible offers to the electorate,"" Paul Johnson, the director of the IFS, told me. ""The first is that it wants to get rid of the deficit in the next few years. And the second thing that the PM said just a couple of weeks ago is that the end of austerity is nigh. ""Well, getting rid of austerity will mean spending at least an extra Â£20bn or so by the end of this parliament [in 2023]. If you're going to spend an extra Â£20bn or so, you're not going to get rid of the deficit unless you have some big tax rises."" Mr Johnson doubted there would be any significant tax rises in the Budget in two weeks' time, as there was still a good deal of economic uncertainty over Brexit and the government would struggle to push any substantial changes through Parliament, where it lacks a majority. ""The chances of anything significant - the chances of the sort of Â£10bn to Â£20bn that might really make a difference - I think are close to zero and essentially for political and not for economic reasons,"" he said. In his interview with the BBC last week,Philip Hammond left the door open to tax rises, but said that any increases would be kept to ""an absolute minimum"" . One policy the government is looking at is freezing tax thresholds (the amount of money working people can earn before they start paying tax), putting in jeopardy a manifesto pledge to raise the limit to Â£12,500 a year for lower-rate taxpayers and Â£50,000 a year for higher-rate taxpayers by 2020. As the BBC revealed last week,the Chancellor is also looking at tightening up self-employment rules, so that more self-employed people pay higher levels of tax . There is a belief in the Treasury that if there is a Brexit deal, that will give a short-term ""relief boost"" to the economy which will help the public finances. Tax revenues tend to rise during periods of better economic growth and the need for benefit payments tends to reduce. The IFS said that austerity was not yet over. Departments such as the Home Office, responsible for police services, the Justice department, responsible for prisons, and local government were facing cuts of Â£4bn in day-to-day spending next year. There are also benefit cuts of Â£7bn to be made by 2023, the report says. The economy is already 2% smaller than expected before the Brexit referendum, which means that the government's revenues from taxes are also lower. Despite the prime minister's pledge that a ""Brexit dividend"" could be used to pay for some of the extra money for the NHS, the IFS said there was ""virtually no"" such dividend by 2023, as savings on contributions to the EU would be less than Â£1bn a year.

"Manchester Oxford Road had the least punctual services, with 68% delayed Rail passengers have been delayed on more than half of all services from 10 of Britain's busiest stations this year, research has found. Manchester Oxford Road took the ""undesirable crown"" of performing worst, according to Which? It found York, Gatwick Airport and Birmingham New Street all saw less than 40% of trains arrive on time. A rail commuter in London said people face ""a daily battle simply to get from A to B"". Robert Nisbet, from the Rail Delivery Group, which represents the rail industry, said it recognised delays were ""frustrating"" and billions were being invested to ""minimise disruption"". Which? looked at services at the 10 busiest stations in London and the 20 busiest outside the capital from the start of January until the end of September. Using data from performance tracking site On Time Trains, the group found 68% of services were delayed at Manchester Oxford Road, rising to 77% during peak times. The city's two largest stations, Piccadilly and Victoria, also suffered a high percentage of late services. A Which? spokesman said the ""timetable chaos earlier this year"", caused by the implementation of new schedules by train operator Northern, had had ""dire knock-on effects for [Manchester] passengers' personal and professional lives"". The data also showed the percentage of service cancellations at each station. London King's Cross saw the highest rate of cancellations - 6% - while Manchester Oxford Road and Gatwick Airport were once again among the worst performing. The Which? spokesman said that while not all delays and cancellations were the fault of the train operators, these ""underperforming destinations and services demonstrate how monitoring and enforcement of punctuality is currently not up to scratch"". Manchester commuter Mark Wylie said the problem ""results in people getting even earlier trains just in case their chosen service is cancelled"", while Jamie Buchanan-Conroy, who travels through Clapham Junction, said the daily delays had caused him to change his commute. ""I paid... to take an indirect route to work because the direct train was so unreliable, I couldn't use it to get to work,"" Mr Buchanan-Conroy said.

"Mr Pompeo thanked the king for his ""commitment"" to an investigation Pressure is growing on Saudi Arabia to explain the fate of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met King Salman in Riyadh. Mr Khashoggi was last seen at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul two weeks ago. Turkish officials believe Mr Khashoggi was murdered by Saudi agents but the Saudis have denied this. However, US media are reporting that the Saudis may be preparing to admit that Mr Khashoggi died as a result of an interrogation that went wrong. Overnight, Turkish police completed a search of the consulate after being admitted by Saudi authorities. Did Apple Watch record Khashoggi killing? Why Saudi Arabia matters to the West More firms pull out of Saudi business conference The secretary of state and the king have now met in Riyadh. While much of what was discussed has yet to be announced, the US State Department said that Mr Pompeo had used the time to thank the king for his ""commitment to a thorough, transparent investigation"" into Mr Khashoggi's disappearance. Mr Pompeo was also expected to seek further clarification over a conversation between the king and President Donald Trump on Monday. This video can not be played President Trump and the King of Saudi Arabia discussed the disappearance of the Saudi journalist Tweeting earlier about the call, Mr Trump said: ""Just spoke to the king of Saudi Arabia who denies any knowledge of whatever may have happened 'to our Saudi Arabian citizen'.""

There is a lot at stake given the strength of Saudi-US ties. Mr Trump has already ruled out cancelling a lucrative arms deal, althoughhe did threaten ""severe punishment""if the kingdom were found to be responsible for the death. King Salman ordered an investigation into the missing journalist on Monday. Saudi statements up to now havedismissed allegations of a killing as ""baseless"" and ""lies"". The kingdom has also angrily rejected what it called political and economic ""threats"",saying it would respond to any punitive action, such as sanctions, ""with a bigger one"". Mr Pompeo is also expected to meet Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman during his day in Riyadh. The secretary of state may then head to Turkey. It appeared in the New York Times and on CNN, quoting unnamed sources. They said Saudi Arabia would acknowledge that Mr Khashoggi's death was the result of an interrogation that went wrong and the intention had been only to abduct him from Turkey. Saudi UK envoy 'concerned' over Khashoggi Turkish press trail Khashoggi's last steps Saudi ties with West at risk over Khashoggi This may explain in part Mr Trump's ""rogue killers"" line. Who such killers could be and how it fits into reports of a Saudi team being despatched to the consulate before Mr Khashoggi's arrival will presumably need to covered. CNN said the Saudis may argue the operation was conducted without clearance,externaland those responsible would be held accountable. The Khashoggi family in Saudi Arabia issued a statement calling for an ""independent and impartial international commission"". By Frank Gardner, BBC News The recent, highly charged exchange of words between Washington and Riyadh now appears to have given way to a mutual search for the least bad explanation. Both countries' leaders know they have an enormous amount to lose if this affair ended up splitting apart their 73-year old strategic partnership. Iran, as the regional rival to Saudi Arabia, would be the prime beneficiary if the Saudis were to lose their defensive US umbrella. President Trump is also correct when he says thousands of US jobs would be lost, with China and Russia to be among those lining up to replace them. Which begs the wider question: is the West's relationship with Saudi Arabia so important that it outweighs the need to condemn and punish what many believe was a state-sponsored murder of a journalist inside a consulate? Hence the urgent dispatching of US Secretary of State for talks with the Saudi leadership. In private there may well be some strong words, in public both countries may want to present a united stand. But one thing is certain: whatever narrative emerges, the international reputation of the Saudi Crown Prince and power-behind-the-throne Mohammed Bin Salman will forever be tainted by this affair. Is this the end of Saudi prince's honeymoon? For the first time since the journalist disappeared on 2 October, Turkish investigators were allowed to enter the building. Turkish officers search the Saudi consulate in Istanbul A Saudi team entered first on Monday, followed roughly an hour later by Turkish forensic police. The Turkish investigators, some wearing overalls, gloves and covered shoes. stayed for about eight hours, leaving in the early hours of Tuesday.

The royal couple arrived in Sydney and were given the first of many gifts for their baby. Australia's Governor-General Sir Peter Cosgrove and his wife Lynne presented them with a toy kangaroo, complete with joey, as well as a little pair of Ugg boots. The baby is due in the spring. How not to upstage someone's wedding Which royal baby was the cutest of all? As well as Australia, the tour will see them visit New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga. Speaking in Sydney, Prince Harry said: ""Thank you for the incredibly warm welcome and the chance to meet so many Aussies from all walks of life. ""We also genuinely couldn't think of a better place to announce the upcoming baby, boy or girl."" The duke and duchess were greeted at Sydney's Admiralty House by flag-bearing representatives from the 18 countries who will be competing at the Invictus Games. Prince Harry is one of the founders of the competition for injured military personnel. Presented with the cuddly kangaroo, Meghan said: ""Our first baby gift!"" while Prince Harry described the boots as ""awesome"". The couple who married in May, were also given Akubras, traditional Australian hats. When the duchess - wearing a white dress by Australian designer Karen Gee - was congratulated on her pregnancy, she replied: ""Thank you so much. We are very excited."" Later Harry and Meghan visited Sydney's Taronga Zoo and were introduced to two joeys named after them to mark their marriage. Meghan remarked that the koalas were ""so, so sweet"". Thousands of people congregated around Sydney Opera House, where the couple took part in a walkabout. They were given soft toys, flowers and other gifts by well-wishers. Among them was 98-year-old Daphne Dunne, whom Harry picked out and greeted warmly. Her first husband, Lieutenant Albert Chowne, died in 1945 during fighting in Papua New Guinea and was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross, which Mrs Dunne was wearing when she first met Prince Harry in 2015. Meghan told her: ""I'm so glad I got to meet you. Harry has told me all about you and your special bond, it's so lovely you came to see us, thank you."" Speaking afterwards, Mrs Dunne said: ""It was lovely to meet the duchess, Meghan. Harry is a wonderful man and I'm so happy he had found happiness, they both deserve the absolute world together.""

"This video can not be played Holly Sargent has had to sell her possessions because of problems receiving universal credit Ministers have bowed to pressure and are planning to further delay the rollout of the flagship welfare reform, universal credit. The system - which will merge six benefits into one payment - has been beset with problems. Leaked documents seen by the BBC reveal plans to spend hundreds of millions of pounds to prevent claimants suffering hardship as they move onto it. The government said it always intended to introduce the benefit slowly. Responding to an urgent question in the House of Commons, Employment Minister Alok Sharma declined to comment on the leaked documents, and said the government would publish plans for the next stage of universal credit ""in due course"". He added that, by December 2018, universal credit would be available in all job centres for new benefits claimants. The switchover for existing benefit claimants to universal credit will be ""slow and measured"" and start in 2019 with ""no more than 10,000 people"" to ensure the system is working. MPs - including Labour's shadow work and pensions secretary Margaret Greenwood - called for a halt in the roll-out of the reform. What is universal credit? Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey told the Commons on Monday that she had been discussing details of universal credit with the chancellor - and details would be revealed in the Budget later this month. The system was supposed to be up and running by April 2017, but is now not expected to be fully operational until December 2023. The Local Government Association welcomed the delay, adding that some of the extra spending should be given to councils so they can provide a safety net to people ""struggling to cope"". It appears that big changes are going to be made in an attempt to reduce the negative impact on people being moved to universal credit. First off, plans have been drawn up to continue paying income support, employment and support allowance, and jobseeker's allowance for two weeks after a claim for universal credit has been made. A similar policy for housing benefit was introduced in last year's Budget, following evidence that some claimants were going into rent arrears. Secondly, there are to be changes to how deductions from a recipient's payment can be made. Claimants can ask for an advance to help them get by while waiting for their first proper universal credit payment - later the government takes deductions from their regular monthly income as pay back. Under the revised plans, the maximum amount that can be deducted will be reduced from 40% to 30% of their total award each month. Thirdly, more help is set to be given to the self-employed, after warnings they could be left in serious financial trouble because of incorrect assumptions by the Department for Work and Pensions about their earnings. Chancellor pressured over universal credit Benefits system 'takes women back to 1950s' Could a basic income replace universal credit? However, the documents highlight that the design of universal credit has already ruled out some concessions. Allowing claimants to receive child tax credits for a fortnight after they apply for the new benefit - which Ms McVey had asked officials to consider - has been ruled out. It would have needed two different systems - the DWP's and HMRC's - to work together to deliver the change, potentially creating additional problems. ""Not having a run-on for child tax credit will be presented as unfavourable treatment of lone parents, who many argue are the most in need of protection of the effects of the move to UC,"" the documents say. The documents seen by the BBC also make clear that the proposed concessions might not actually be achievable. An extract says: ""We can currently offer no assurance that ultimately these proposals will prove to be deliverable, can survive legal challenges where they can be delivered, and do not invite new political criticism by generating new policy issues."" This video can not be played Sir John Major warns the Conservatives over universal credit The government was intending to begin moving almost four million people onto universal credit from January 2019, initially in small batches. Larger scale movements were due to start next July. Now though, initial testing has been pushed back to next summer, and large-scale movement won't begin until November 2020 at the earliest. The leaked papers predict that overall, the latest delay will add an additional nine months to the final deadline for full implementation. The policy was first announced under the coalition government in 2010. It's supposed to simplify benefits for working-age people, replacing income support, jobseeker's allowance, employment and support allowance, housing benefit, child tax credit, and working tax credit. BBC Reality Check has broken all this down in more detail. Pressure has been mounting on the government for weeks to either delay or halt the next stage of the reform. Much criticism has centred on the time it takes for people applying for universal credit to receive their first payment - 35 days - with some claimants left struggling to pay their bills in that period. On Monday, independent MP Frank Field said the rollout of the system in his constituency of Birkenhead had driven some female claimants to sex work. One Universal Credit recipient, Naomi Krykawiak, told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme she first applied whilst pregnant, and had to wait around six weeks for the benefit to be accepted. ""It did definitely mean using food banks... it's something I had to do around eight times before the benefit was accepted."" This video can not be played Esther McVey on universal credit: Some will be worse off The Church of England said the fallout from the new benefit system was seen at its food banks across the country. More than 30 Anglican bishops have backed a campaign calling for the government to ""fix"" universal credit. Anger built further last week when Ms McVey said that ""some people will be worse off"" under the new system, amidclaims 3.2 million households,externalwill lose more than Â£2,000 year. The Times newspaper suggested she had told a cabinet meeting some families could lose up to Â£200 a month. Mrs McVey insisted, though, that the most vulnerable would be protected. A Department for Work and Pensions statement said it was taking a ""a slow and measured approach to managed migration [of the system]"" and wanted ""to ensure the system is working well for claimants and to make any necessary adaptations as we go"". ""We will publish full plans for the next stage of universal credit rollout, including managed migration, in due course. Anything before that point is speculation and we do not comment on leaks."" Labour said the government needed to provide urgent answers about what was going on and what action would be taken ""to tackle the many flaws in the system"".

"Mr Pompeo thanked the king for his ""commitment"" to an investigation Pressure is growing on Saudi Arabia to explain the fate of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met King Salman in Riyadh. Mr Khashoggi was last seen at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul two weeks ago. Turkish officials believe Mr Khashoggi was murdered by Saudi agents but the Saudis have denied this. However, US media are reporting that the Saudis may be preparing to admit that Mr Khashoggi died as a result of an interrogation that went wrong.

"Durham student Matthew Hedges has been held in solitary confinement for five months, his wife says A British student has been charged with spying for the UK government in the United Arab Emirates. Matthew Hedges was accused of ""spying for and on behalf of a foreign state"", the UAE government said on Monday. The 31-year-old PhD student at Durham University was arrested on 5 May in Dubai and hasreportedly been held in solitary confinement for five months. His wife Daniela Tejada has called on the UK government to deny he was spying for them. Mr Hedges was detained at Dubai Airport as he was leaving the country following a research trip. A family spokeswoman said he had been accused of spying for the UK government while in the UAE to interview sources about the country's foreign policy and security strategy. In a statement, the UAE government said: ""The attorney general of United Arab Emirates confirmed today that Matthew Hedges, a British citizen, has been charged with spying for and on behalf of a foreign state, jeopardizing the military, economy and political security of the UAE."" Daniela Tejada says she is worried about her husband's mental health Ms Tejada, who lives in Exeter with her husband, said she had seen reports he would go on trial for spying and would appear in court next week, but had not received official confirmation from the UAE or the Foreign Office. ""I no longer know what to do to get Matt out of prison in the UAE,"" she added. ""I am calling on the UK government to clarify publicly that Matt is innocent of the charges and that there have been many falsehoods said about him. ""It is the duty of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to protect their citizens abroad. ""This horrifying situation has been going on for far too long."" Does UAE stability come at a price? United Arab Emirates profile Ms Tejada claimed her husband had not received ""appropriate medical care and attention, especially in regard to his mental health"" during his time in solitary confinement. ""Since he was detained he has only ever been granted two consular visits which is in direct violation of his rights."" She described Mr Hedges, who was researching the impact of the Arab Spring on the UAE's foreign policy and security strategy, as ""a man of integrity and principle"". The Foreign Office said it was providing support, while Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt had raised ""a number of concerns"" about the case with his UAE counterpart.

"Has it really been less than 18 months since Air Force One touched down in Riyadh to a red carpet welcome? When President Trump chose Saudi Arabia for his first overseas presidential visit in May last year most Saudis were delighted. They hadn't much cared for his predecessor, Barack Obama. He was never that interested in the Middle East, they reckoned, and his legacy nuclear deal with Iran was a bad one in their eyes. But Donald Trump was a man they could do business with. He lifted the Obama-era curbs on weapons sales for the war in Yemen, he refrained from lecturing them on human rights and he seemed happy for his son-in-law Jared Kushner to forge an exceptionally close working relationship with Saudi Arabia's all powerful Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman. Why Saudi Arabia matters to the West Saudi Arabia country profile Five things about Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince A return visit by MBS as he is known, to the White House, the Pentagon and Hollywood ensued. MBS was similarly welcomed in London, despite anti-war protests that his prosecution of the conflict in Yemen was fuelling a humanitarian tragedy there. Journalist Jamal Khashoggi's disappearance has brought criticism of the Saudi Crown Prince (L) At home in Saudi Arabia, Western diplomats hailed MBS's modernising reforms as the long overdue breath of fresh air the country needed. He lifted the ban on women driving, reintroduced public entertainment and curbed the power of the unpopular religious police. What we know about Jamal Khashoggi's disappearance Why Khashoggi case alarms Saudi activists Trump suggests 'rogue killers' to blame At the same time he announced staggeringly ambitious plans to wean the country off its dependence on oil income by building a $500 billion futuristic city in the desert. Saudi Arabia under MBS was going places and this time last year the world beat a path to his door, flocking to attend his inaugural Future Investment Initiative in Riyadh. Happier times. A cameraman takes a break during the inaugural presidential visit by Donald Trump A lot has changed. The warning signs that MBS may not be quite the liberal reformer the West had hoped for came when he arbitrarily locked up dozens of princes and business figures last year in a luxury hotel, accusing them of corruption. He briefly detained Lebanon's Prime Minister Saad Hariri, allegedly forcing him to resign. He also ordered the arrest of anyone who dared to question his reform agenda, even with just a simple tweet. But it was the deeply suspicious disappearance inside the Saudi consulate on 2 October of his most prominent critic, Jamal Khashoggi, that has caused even his close ally Donald Trump to talk of ""severe punishment"" if Saudi government guilt is proven. We can retaliate in kind, came the Saudi response on Sunday, reminding the world of their decisive role in the oil market. This video can not be played President Trump said he had discussed the disappearance of the journalist with the Saudi king Encouraged by the state-controlled media, many Saudis have rallied round their leadership. There is even a popular rumour that what happened in Istanbul is all a plot by Qatar and Turkey to discredit the blameless Saudi kingdom. But privately, others are now questioning whether the 33-year old prince, the man once hailed as a visionary saviour of Saudi Arabia, has gone too far. He has pitched his country into a costly and seemingly unwinnable war in Yemen. He is embroiled in a damaging dispute with neighbouring Qatar, he has quarrelled with Canada over human rights and he has locked up dozens for peaceful protest while alienating many in royal and business circles. More conservative Saudis may well be hankering for quieter times. Saudi Crown Prince: Five things to know.
