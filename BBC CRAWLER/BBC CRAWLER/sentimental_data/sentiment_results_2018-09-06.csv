"The US and UK said in December that North Korea was responsible for the malware attack US prosecutors have charged a North Korean man alleged to have been involved in creating the malicious software used to cripple the UKâs National Health Service. The 2017 incident left NHS staff reverting to pen and paper after being locked out of computer systems. Park Jin Hyok is said to be linked to the Lazarus Group. The hacking collective is also blamed for the hack on Sony Pictures in 2014. The US Department of Justice alleged the North Korean-backed cyber group had caused major damage. ""The scale and scope of the cyber-crimes alleged by the complaint is staggering and offensive to all who respect the rule of law and the cyber norms accepted by responsible nations,â said the Assistant Attorney General for National Security, John Demers. âThe complaint alleges that the North Korean government, through a state-sponsored group; robbed a central bank and citizens of other nations; retaliated against free speech in order to chill it half a world away; and created disruptive malware that indiscriminately affected victims in more than 150 other countries, causing hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollarsâ worth of damage.â North Korea routinely denies being involved in hack attacks attributed to them. Mr Park is charged with one count of conspiracy to commit computer fraud and abuse, and wire fraud. Prosecutors said Mr Park was believed to be in North Korea. ""North Korea won't be handing over this guy any time soon,"" said Martyn Williams, a North Korea observer and journalist. ""So it likely won't mean much on that level, but it is a symbolic step for the US government to take. ""It helps put meat on the bones of the numerous reports that said North Korea was responsible and is a relatively rare move for the US government."" The attribution of cyber-attacks is often very difficult because of the ability of skilled hackers to hide their tracks. The 180-page complaint document,externalgoes into detail about why US prosecutors believe Mr Park was heavily involved in the targeted action. It attempts to join the dots by linking various social media aliases with email accounts later used to target those in the financial and entertainment industries. The document includes screenshots of fake emails designed to look like legitimate notes from Facebook, prompting a user to ""simply log in again"" to verify an account. Following the link would bring the victim to a spoof site designed to covertly collect their credentials. Another example was a screenshot of an email from a ""college student"" seeking to send her resume to a Sony Pictures executive - the accompanying link brought the victim to a malicious site. Not all of the group's work was successful, however. The FBI said it had found evidence of a failed attempt to gain access to defence contractor Lockheed Martin. British police assisted the FBI with its investigation. ""The collaboration between UK and US law enforcement has been strong and effective,"" said Steve Rodhouse, head of operations at the National Crime Agency. ""And these charges show that we will not tire in our efforts to identify those who believe they can hide behind a computer and cause havoc across the world, regardless of their motivation or status.""

"Supermarket giant Asda is to end a scheme which refunded shoppers if the items they bought cost more than in rival stores. TheAsda Price Guarantee,externalwas launched in 2010, promising a basket of shopping at the chain would be 10% cheaper than at the UK's other large grocery chains. If not, Asda would offer customers a voucher worth the difference in price. Rival Tesco dropped its Brand Guarantee scheme in June, while Sainsbury's ended its Brand Match programme in 2016. The Asda Price Guarantee will come to an end on 3 October, and shoppers will have 28 days from then to redeem any remaining coupons. The company said the scheme was no longer popular. ""[Customers] have more price information at their fingertips than ever and they vote with their feet if they feel a retailer is off the mark on price,"" said chief customer officer Andy Murray. ""Today, the Asda Price Guarantee, whilst still the iron-clad promise it always was, has become less and less relevant to customers, with less than 1% of customers using it."" Asda said it had invested more than Â£100m in cutting prices over the last 12 months. It says it plans another series of cuts next month. The UK's so-called ""big four"" supermarket groups, including fourth-placed Morrisons, have been under increasing price pressure from German discounters Aldi and Lidl. Asda, which isowned by US parent Walmart, has agreed to a takeover by bigger rival Sainsbury's, which is set to pay Â£7.3bn for the brand. The two firms have said the combination of the two companies would seeprices lowered by 10%on a range of everyday items. In August, the UK's competition watchdog launched an investigation into the proposed Sainsbury's-Asda merger.

"Kendricks won the Super Bowl with the Philadelphia Eagles last season Super Bowl-winning linebacker Mychal Kendricks is facing up to 25 years in prison after pleading guilty to charges of insider trading. Prosecutors said Kendricks made around $1.2m (Â£0.92m) over two years working with a former Goldman Sachs analyst. Kendricks, 27, admitted that he swapped cash, NFL tickets and access to parties for market-shifting information. He won the Super Bowl with the Philadelphia Eagles last season before joining the Cleveland Browns in June. Kendricks will be sentenced in December. Cleveland terminated his one-year, $2.25m (Â£1.74m) contract on 29 August, hours after the charges were announced. At the time, Kendricks released a statement in which he said he ""deeply regretted"" becoming involved with ""a former friend of mine who I thought I could trust"". He added: ""Four years ago, I participated in insider trading. While I didn't fully understand all of the details of the illegal trades, I knew it was wrong, and I wholeheartedly regret my actions. ""To this point, I had worked my tail off since I was five years old to become a football player. I was drawn in by the allure of being more than just a football player. ""Although I did not take any of the profits for myself, I am committed to repaying all of the funds gained illegally. I accept full responsibility for my actions.""

"British Airways's boss has apologised for what he says was a sophisticated breach of the firm's security systems, and has promised compensation. Alex Cruz told the BBC that hackers carried out a ""sophisticated, malicious criminal attack"" on its website. The airline said personal and financial details of customers making or changing bookings had been compromised. About 380,000 transactions were affected, but the stolen data did not include travel or passport details. ""We are 100% committed to compensate them, period,"" Mr Cruz told the BBC's Today programme. ""We are committed to working with any customer who may have been financially affected by this attack, and we will compensate them for any financial hardship that they may have suffered."" BA said the breach took place between 22:58 BST on 21 August and 21:45 BST on 5 September.  Shares in BA parent group IAG closed 1.4% lower on Friday. Mr Cruz also told the Today programme: ""We're extremely sorry. I know that it is causing concern to some of our customers, particularly those customers that made transactions over BA.com and app. ""We discovered that something had happened but we didn't know what it was [on Wednesday evening]. So overnight, teams were trying to figure out the extent of the attack. This video can not be played British Airways' chairman and CEO says affected customers will be 100% compensated ""The first thing was to find out if it was something serious and who it affected or not. The moment that actual customer data had been compromised, that's when we began immediate communication to our customers."" BA said all customers affected by the breach had been contacted on Thursday night.  The breach only affects people who bought tickets during the timeframe provided by BA, and not on other occasions. Mr Cruz added: ""At the moment, our number one purpose is contacting those customers that made those transactions to make sure they contact their credit card bank providers so they can follow their instructions on how to manage that breach of data."" The airline has taken out adverts apologising for the breach in Friday's newspapers. By Simon Read, business reporter What data was stolen? ""It was name, email address, credit card information - that would be credit card number, expiration date and the three digit [CVV] code on the back of the credit card,"" said BA boss Mr Cruz. BA insists it did not store the CVV numbers.  This is prohibited under international standards set out by the PCI Security Standards Council. Since BA said the attackers also managed to obtain CVV numbers, security researchers have speculated that the card details were intercepted, rather than harvested from a BA database. How did hackers get in? It isn't totally clear how hackers boarded BA's website and app - but cyber-security experts have some suggestions. How did hackers get into British Airways? What could the hackers do with the data? Once fraudsters have your personal information, they may be able to access your bank account, or open new accounts in your name, or use your details to make fraudulent purchases. They could also sell on your details to other crooks. What do I need to do? If you've been affected, you should change your online passwords. Then monitor your bank and credit card accounts keeping an eye out for any dodgy transactions. Also be very wary of any emails or calls asking for more information to help deal with the data breach: crooks often pose as police, banks or, in this instance they could pretend to be from BA. Will my booking be affected? BA says none of the bookings have been hit by the breach.  It said it has contacted all those affected to alert them to the problem with their data, but booked flights should go ahead. Will there be compensation for me? If you suffer any financial loss or hardship, the airline has promised to compensate you. Jorg Herrera, from Amersham in Buckinghamshire, received an email from BA last night having booked tickets with the airline last month. ""I have six cards linked to my BA account,"" he told the BBC. ""I have no idea how much of my information has been stolen. ""I will have to go to each of my credit card providers, cancel the cards, and all the direct debits, etc, related to those cards. This will take a long time, something I have to do with no help from BA. ""This whole thing is terribly concerning and really annoying."" BA could potentially face fines from the Information Commissioner's Office, which is looking into the breach. Rachel Aldighieri, managing director of the Direct Marketing Association, said: ""British Airways has a duty to ensure their customer data is always secure. They need to show that they have done everything possible to ensure such a breach won't happen again. ""The risks go far beyond the fines regulators can issue - albeit that these could be hefty under the new [EU data protection] GDPR regime."" Under GDPR, fines can be up to 4% of annual global revenue. BA's total revenue in the year to 31 December 2017 was Â£12.226bn, so that could be a potential maximum of Â£489m. The National Crime Agency and National Cyber Security Centre also confirmed they were assessing the incident. This is not the first customer relations problem to affect the airline in recent times. In July, BA apologised afterIT issues caused dozens of flights in and out of Heathrow Airport to be cancelled. The month before,more than 2,000 BA passengers had their tickets cancelledbecause the prices were too cheap. And in May 2017, problems with BA's IT systems led to thousands of passengers having their plans disrupted, afterall flights from Heathrow and Gatwick were cancelled. ""It does not indicate that the information systems are the most robust in the airline industry,"" Simon Calder, travel editor at the Independent, told the BBC. However, he does not think BA will be affected in the long term by the breach. ""The airline has immense strength. Notably it's holding a majority of slots at Heathrow, and an enviable safety record, so while this is embarrassing and will potentially cost tens of millions of pounds to resolve, it's more like another flesh wound for BA, rather than anything serious.""

"Alex Jones is currently being sued for defamation Twitter says it has permanently suspended the accounts of Alex Jones and his Infowars website. It made the move after a number of tweets that violated Twitter's abusive behaviour policy, the company said. A number of tech giants, including YouTube and Facebook, deleted the right-wing conspiracy theorist's content last month, citing hate speech. The radio host is best known for spreading unsubstantiated allegations about tragic events, including 9/11. He is currently being sued for defamation by the parents of two children killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, which he has repeatedly claimed was a ""giant hoax"". Twenty children under the age of seven and six adults died in the attack. Twitter said the ban was a result of ""new reports of tweets and videos posted yesterday that violate our abusive behaviour policy, in addition to the accounts' past violations"". It did not specify what the violations were. Facebook, Twitter 'too slow' on meddling Infowars v Sandy Hook case explained Why I'm suing Alex Jones It added that it does ""not typically comment on enforcement actions... against individual accounts"", but was ""open about this action given the broad interest in this case"". Mr Jones has accused media platforms of unfair censorship of his accounts. Twitter had come under criticism last month when it refused to ban InfoWarsand Alex Jones from its platform, despite YouTube, Facebook, Apple and Spotify deleting his content. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey said at the time this was because the accounts had not violated the platform's rules - but he vowed to suspend them if they ever did so. Mr Jones mostly uses his Twitter account to share content and videos from InfoWars with his 850,000 followers, and promotes conspiracy theories against liberals, Muslims and migrants. In July, he said that Democrats planned to launch a civil war on 4 July or US Independence Day Last year, he tweeted that Muslims in England were demanding that the Queen either convert to Islam or leave the country. However, the CNN clip Infowars based its article on dates back to 2009 and features a group led by radical preacher Anjem Choudary, who by 2017 was already serving a five-and-a-half-year sentence for inviting support for the Islamic State group (IS) He has previously said that ""transgenderism"" is a CIA ""plan to depopulate humanity"" and that the ""normalisation of mental illness"" is an ""evil paedophile plot to sexualise and destroy children"" In 2013, he described then-President Barack Obama as the ""global head of al-Qaeda"", and later accused him of arming IS On Wednesday, Mr Dorsey and Facebook's chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg answered questions at a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing about what technology giants are doing to prevent future election meddling. During the hearing, Mr Dorsey was also asked whether Twitter censors conservative voices. Twitter admits 'unfairly' hiding accounts Several Republicans, including US President Donald Trump, have accused Twitter of bias, which the company denies. Mr Dorsey said his company did ""not use political ideology to make any decisions"", but admitted the company's algorithms had not always been ""impartial"". Mr Jones also sat in on the hearing, and made headlines after he confronted Republican Senator Marco Rubio while Mr Rubio was being interviewed. Allow Twitter content?

"Presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, pictured seconds after being stabbed in the stomach The front-runner in Brazil's presidential election, Jair Bolsonaro, has been stabbed at a campaign rally. The far-right politician was attacked in a crowd in the south-east state of Minas Gerais. A suspect was arrested. Mr Bolsonaro had surgery for injuries to his intestines and is expected to recover, hospital officials said. The controversial politician, who has outraged many in Brazil with racist and homophobic comments, has performed strongly in recent opinion polls. The polls suggest he will get the most votes in the first round of the October presidential elections if former President Luis InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva remains blocked from standing, but he is unlikely to win a run-off. Left-wing Lula had been the long-standing favourite buthe is currently in prison, appealing against a ban on his candidacy that was imposed after his conviction for corruption. 'Brazil's Trump' enters presidential race Some of Mr Bolsonaro's past comments have caused uproar, including equating homosexuality with paedophilia, and saying a congresswoman was too ugly to be raped. Katy Watson, BBC South America correspondent, SÃ£o Paulo This is another twist - a dramatic one - in what has already been a turbulent campaign for one of Brazil's most uncertain elections in decades. The front-runner Lula is unlikely to be able to run because he's locked up in prison. Jair Bolsonaro is expected to win the first round in his absence, but he is in a hospital bed. It is a surreal situation. One of Jair Bolsonaro's key campaign messages is that he will try to turn around the growth in violent crime. The fact that he is now a victim himself plays into the hands of his supporters, who see this as a very important problem for Brazil to tackle. Everyone - including his detractors - has rallied around him to condemn the attack. As it has happened so close to the October election, he won't be on the campaign trail for the next week or so. Nevertheless, his supporters will be strengthened, seeing that his concerns are their concerns. Footage of the incident in the city of Juiz de Fora shows Mr Bolsonaro making a thumbs-up gesture and being held aloft by supporters when he is stabbed with what appears to be a knife. He then doubles over with pain and his supporters quickly lower him to the ground and bundle him into a car. After the attack, his son Flavio tweeted: ""Unfortunately it was more serious than we had expected. He lost a lot of blood, arrived at the hospital with a [blood] pressure of 10/3, almost dead. His condition now seems stabilised. Pray, please!"" Hospital officials later said Mr Bolsonaro had suffered a ""deep"" and life-threatening stab wound in his intestines and was in a ""serious but stable"" condition. Military police released a picture of the man suspected of stabbing Mr Bolsonaro He was recuperating well in intensive care after two hours of surgery, they added, but would spend at least a week to 10 days in hospital. He has since been filmed in his hospital bed, making a hoarse statement. He described how what he thought was ""just a blow"" turned into an unbearable pain. He had ""never hurt anyone"", he said. Police said a suspect had been arrested, naming him as Adelio Obispo de Oliveira, 40. Officials quoted by Reuters news agency said he appeared to be mentally disturbed. He was manhandled and beaten by angry supporters of Mr Bolsonaro before being taken into custody. Stabbing suspect Adelio Obispo de Oliveira was grabbed by members of the crowd It took the crowd some moments to realise Jair Bolsonaro, top right, had been stabbed Mr Bolsonaro's electoral rivals have all condemned the stabbing. Fernando Haddad, who is expected to replace Lula on the Workers' Party ticket, said the attack was ""absurd and regrettable"". Speaking in the capital Brasilia, President Michel Temer said such an attack was ""intolerable"" in a democratic state and that he hoped Mr Bolsonaro recovered soon. The president's predecessor, Dilma Rousseff, warned that the attack must not go unpunished. Brazilian stocks rose after the attack on Mr Bolsonaro, as it was seen as increasing his chances. His free-market economics make him popular with investors. Supporters of Mr Bolsonaro in Sao Paulo held a vigil for him The 63-year-old, who is representing the Social Liberal Party (PSL), is followed by millions of Brazilians on social media, and many refer to him as the ""Brazilian Trump"". Brazil's unlikely young conservatives He also supports loosening gun control laws, and is backed by millions of evangelical Christians for his uncompromising anti-abortion stance. A former army captain, Mr Bolsonaro entered politics in the 1980s to defend the rights of military personnel. Few imagined at that time that he could become a serious contender. But the collapse of the Workers' Party government and the impeachment of President Rousseff two years ago revealed the extent of political divisions. Mr Bolsonaro has performed strongly in polls ahead of next month's election Mr Bolsonaro's outspoken rhetoric and his defence of law and order appealed to many who blamed the left for corruption and the economic crisis. In 2011, he told Playboy magazine that he would be ""incapable of loving a gay son"" and that he would rather see such a son of his ""die in an accident"". In 2015, he was fined for saying in a newspaper interview that Congresswoman Maria do Rosario was ""not worth raping; she is very ugly"". He is currently being investigated for alleged racism over derogatory remarks he made about Afro-Brazilians. President Temer, an unpopular leader, is not standing for re-election, and millions of voters remain undecided. Mr Bolsonaro is expected to have a strong first round but lose a run-off to leftist Ciro Gomes, environmentalist Marina Silva or ex-Governor of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, according to leading research company Ibope. A race against Lula's likely replacement, Fernando Haddad, could be much narrower. Ibope said its most recent survey showed Mr Bolsonaro losing to him by just one percentage point. Mr Haddad was charged with corruption earlier this week and, like Lula, denies any wrongdoing. On Thursday, the Supreme Court rejected Lula's latest appeal to run. The Workers' Party has until the end of Tuesday to register Mr Haddad as its presidential candidate.

"Probiotics include yogurts that contain ""good bacteria"". A group of scientists in Israel claim foods that are packed with good bacteria - called probiotics - are almost useless. Their study is among the most detailed analyses of what happens when we consumeprobiotics,external. They are seen as healthy and good for the gut, but the results found they had little or no effect inside the body. The researchers said probiotics of the future would need tailoring to the needs of each individual. The team at the Weizmann Institute of Science made their own probiotic cocktail using 11 common good bacteria including strains ofLactobacillusandBifidobacteria. It was given to 25 healthy volunteers for a month. They were then sedated and samples were surgically taken from multiple places in the stomach and small and large intestines. The researchers were looking to see where bacteria successfully colonised and whether they led to any changes in the activity of the gut. The results in the journal Cell,external, showed in half of cases the good bacteria went in the mouth and straight out the other end. In the rest, they lingered briefly before being crowded out by our existing microbes. You're more microbe than human - if you count all the cells in your body, only 43% are human The rest is our microbiome and includes bacteria, viruses, fungi and single-celled archaea The human genome - the full set of genetic instructions for a human being - is made up of 20,000 instructions called genes But add all the genes in our microbiome together and the figure comes out at between two million and 20 million microbial genes It's known as the second genome and is linked to diseases including allergy, obesity, inflammatory bowel disease, Parkinson's, whether cancer drugs work and even depression and autism More than half your body is not human Gut Instinct: Why I put my poo in the post Does vaginal seeding boost health? Why a faecal transplant could save your life How bacteria are changing your mood Trillions of bacteria call the lining of our guts home and everyone has a different mix of microbial inhabitants. Dr Eran Elinav said it was wrong to expect an off-the-shelf probiotic to work for everyone. He says that in the future probiotics will need to be tailored to the needs of individual patients. He told the BBC: ""And in that sense just buying probiotics at the supermarket without any tailoring, without any adjustment to the host, at least in part of the population, is quite useless."" The research group also looked at the impact of probiotics after a course of antibiotics, which wipe out both good and bad bacteria. Their trial on 46 people,also in the journal Cell,external, showed it led to delays in the normal healthy bacteria re-establishing themselves. Dr Elinav added: ""Contrary to the current dogma that probiotics are harmless and benefit everyone, these results reveal a new potential adverse side effect of probiotic use with antibiotics that might even bring long-term consequences.""

"Secretary of State Karen Bradley was appointed to the post in January The Secretary of State has said she initially did not understand that nationalists did not vote for unionist parties during elections. Karen Bradley said she did not comprehend that campaigns are generally fought within each part of the community. She told The House magazine that it was ""a very different world from the world I came from"". Mrs Bradley was appointed in January to replace James Brokenshire. Mr Brokenshire stepped down for medical reasons. ""I didn't understand things like when elections are fought for example in Northern Ireland - people who are nationalists don't vote for unionist parties and vice-versa,""Mrs Bradley told House magazine, a weekly publication for the Houses of Parliament,external. ""So, the parties fight for election within their own community. ""Actually, the unionist parties fight the elections against each other in unionist communities and nationalists in nationalist communities,"" she added. Northern Ireland has been without an executive since January 2017 after a bitter row between the governing parties, the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in. On Thursday Mrs Bradley announced that she intended to cut Stormont Assembly members' pay. Karen Bradley has also ruled out calling a fresh Assembly election and she is to bring forward legislation to allow civil servants to make decisions in the absence of devolution. MLA pay will fall in November from Â£49,500 to Â£35,888. In her interview with House Magazine she said: ""I had no idea how wonderful Northern Ireland was. I was slightly scared of Northern Ireland because of my impression and images from 20 years ago. That is not the place that it is today.""

"Kayden was 20 months old when he died There was ""gross failure"" in the care of a toddler who died while awaiting emergency surgery, a coroner has said. Serious and basic failings led to an ""unacceptable delay"" in Kayden Urmston-Bancroft's operation on a diaphragmatic hernia, an inquest heard. Coroner Angharad Davies concluded the 20-month-old 's death of natural causes was ""contributed to by neglect"". The former medical director of Royal Manchester Children's Hospital offered ""profound apologies"" to his family. This video can not be played Kayden screamed in pain for days, said his grandmother Kayden, from Stockport, suffered a cardiac arrest at the hospital on 15 April 2016, three days after being admitted. He died two days later. The four-day inquest at Manchester town hall heard Kayden's death could have been prevented were it not for failings in his care. Ms Davies identified missed opportunities to perform the surgery and said there were ""a number of serious and basic failings which meant Kayden was not operated on that week"". The ""unacceptable delay"" in his surgery was ""sufficiently serious to amount to a gross failure"", she said. Surgeon 'apologised for toddler's death' Op delay toddler 'could have survived' Clinging to happy memories of Kayden Kayden was transferred from Stepping Hill Hospital and placed on an emergency surgery list, the inquest heard. His notes said there was no bed available in the children's hospital's high dependency unit (HDU), so he could not have the operation. Mother Shannon Bancroft was ""very upset"" at the delay, but her son's consultant said he remained well, the notes said. Kayden's mum Shannon Bancroft was left devastated by his death A report showed a bed was not requested until midday on 15 April, but records showed three had been available on that day. The inquest heard consultant Mohamed Shoukry thought the bed for Kayden had been taken by another emergency. Ms Davies said it was ""inexplicable"" as to why he was under the impression there was no HDU bed available, saying there was a ""basic, fundamental communication problem"". She also told the court there had been ""confusion"" over who the consultant with responsibility for Kayden's care had been. By Hugh Pym, Health Editor It is one of Britain's biggest and most prestigious children's hospitals - but a coroner has made the extremely rare ruling for an NHS trust that there was gross failure in the care of a young boy with neglect contributing to his death. The coroner, in her conclusion at the inquest, covered some of the factors at Royal Manchester Children's Hospital which had caused ""unacceptable delays"" in the urgent operation needed by Kayden Urmston-Bancroft. This included what she said were difficulties with the hospital's culture which could allow routine surgery to be prioritised over emergency cases. When the BBC uncovered the story last year there were claims that the waiting list had got too long and there was pressure to reduce it. Lawyers for Kayden's family have welcomed the ruling but urged all hospitals to look at their own procedures to ensure there are no more such avoidable deaths. During the inquest, hospital boss Sir Michael Deegan said it was likely Kayden would have survived but for failings in his care. In a letter read out at Wednesday's hearing, he apologised unreservedly for the ""unacceptable lapse of standards"". After the inquest concluded, Kayden's family said ""knowing that he could have been saved is hard to bear"". ""You take your child to hospital and you think everything will be alright, that they'll be able to make them better,"" they said. ""We put Kayden's life in their hands and they let us down in the worst way possible. ""We begged them to help him over and over, but instead we had to watch him fade away. ""He died in pain and that's the thing I don't think we can ever forgive"". Coroner Angharad Davies found the hospital made a ""number of serious and basic failings"" After the inquest, Prof Bob Pearson - former medical director of the hospital's trust - offered ""profound apologies"" to Kayden's family outside court. He said the trust launched a ""rigorous and wide-ranging"" investigation after the death and measures in place ""to make sure this does not happen again"".

"UPDATED: 6 September 2018. Burt Reynolds has died, reportedly in a Florida hospital after a heart attack.Read his obituary here. It's 40 years since a nude Cosmopolitan centrefold of actor Burt Reynolds broke a taboo and launched a new era of women's magazine publishing. ""At last a male nude centrefold - the naked truth about guess who!!"" screamed a banner on the front page. Cosmopolitan editor Helen Gurley Brown saw it as a victory for women whose ""visual appetites"" had been ignored by male magazine editors and proprietors. It also boosted Cosmopolitan's circulation and turned Burt Reynolds into a 1970s sex icon. So what was the story behind the photograph? 1. It began ona TV show. Burt Reynolds was standing in for Johnny Carson as presenter of the Tonight show on NBC, and Helen Gurley Brown was his guest. ""He was handsome, humorous, wonderful body, frisky,"" she told James Landers, author ofa book on the first 100 years of Cosmopolitan,external. ""During our conversation I asked him if he would pose for us."" He agreed. 2. It could havebeen Paul Newman. Gurley Brown had approached him, before putting the question to Burt Reynolds, but he had refused. 3. It made BurtReynolds into a celeb. The day after the magazine hit news-stands, he was mobbed  by women asking him to sign their copy. Reynolds also noticed a change in the behaviour of theatre audiences from ""polite to boisterous"". ""Standing ovations turned into burlesque show hoots and catcalls. They cared more about my pubes than they did about the play,"" he wrote in his 1994 autobiography, My Life. Gurley Brown said: ""He had been a movie star, now he was a celebrity."" 4. It made Cosmopolitannotorious. ""At the time, you know, men liked to look at women naked. Well, nobody talked about it, but women liked to look at men naked. I did,"" Gurley Brown told Landers, who noted that the photograph pushed Cosmopolitan across a threshold, in the public mind, from a mainstream magazine ""to a sex magazine"". 5. It spawned Playgirlmagazine. Douglas Lambert, owner of the Playgirl Club, decided to launch the magazine after seeing what a ""winner"" the Burt Reynolds centrefold was. ""It came to me, that's what women want. If a woman says she wants to see a man's smile, his eyes, I say 'Don't lie to me,'"" he was quoted as saying. 6. Reynolds chose thepicture. A number of shots were taken. The choice of which would be published was left to the model. 7. The bearskin wasa humorous touch. ""I think that's probably a joke,"" says New York-based fashion portrait photographer Max Vadukul. ""This is a very macho statement, a real bloke, full on, and totally confident,"" he says. He reckons Reynolds would have been happy going further, and removing the artfully placed arm from his lap. 8. You won't seethis in 2012. It would be a tough photograph to take in 2012, Vadukul says, because of the ""commodity factor"" - the actor's publicists would be concerned about damage to his brand, among some members of the public. ""It's a very modern picture, it would still be a very talkative picture. Who would be the equivalent of this guy - George Clooney? It's very far ahead of its time, from that period when anything goes, people swinging partners non-stop..."" 9. The photographer wasthe celebrated Francesco Scavullo. Scavullo shot most Cosmopolitan covers over a 30-year period, and was involved in controversy again when he took photographs of a young Brooke Shields that some considered too sexual. He died in 2004, on the day he was due to photograph CNN anchor Anderson Cooper. 10. Arnold Schwarzenegger wasthe next but one centrefold. Cosmopolitan did not do these very often. It took two years for the next to appear, andSchwarzenegger made his appearance in 1977,external. Another man to grace the centre pages was Scott Brown, now a Massachusetts senator, but in June 1982 a law student who had entered and won the magazine's America's Sexiest Man contest.He posed for the cameras,externaldays before his final exams.

"Burt Reynolds charmed and swaggered his way to being one of Hollywood's best-known stars. From his early days in a seemingly endless series of Westerns, he went on to appear in films of the quality of Deliverance before embracing comedy in The Cannonball Run and Smokey and the Bandit. He was one of cinema's top box-office draws and notable sex symbols in the 1970s, and had a lifestyle in which he enjoyed many fast cars and seducing some of his female co-stars. But his career and his finances plummeted downwards in the 1980s and it was a decade before he returned to form and a whole new audience. Burton Leon Reynolds was born in Lansing, the state capital of Michigan, on 11 February 1936. With the onset of World War Two, his father was drafted into the US Army and the family moved to Missouri. When his father returned from service in Europe, he became the chief of police in Riviera Beach, Florida, and the young Reynolds attended the local high school. There, he developed as a skilful football player, winning a sports scholarship to Florida State University. He had ambitions to turn professional and was being considered by the Baltimore Colts. His aspirations to be a professional footballer were ended by injury But a knee injury in his first major college game ended his dreams of fame and fortune on the football field. ""It tore me apart,"" he later said. ""My dad probably took it harder than I did - he was crushed"" He began taking English lessons with a view to becoming a parole officer but his teacher, having heard Reynolds reading Shakespeare aloud, cast him in a production of the play Outward Bound, and his performance won him the 1956 Florida State Drama Award. A move to New York brought him into contact with the actress Joanne Woodward, who introduced him to theatre producers. He was cast in a production by the Neighborhood Playhouse, an establishment that had launched the careers of, among others, Gregory Peck, Dustin Hoffman and Robert Duvall. But a breakthrough eluded him and, despite good reviews, he found himself doing a variety of jobs including lorry driving and working as a waiter. It was television that came to his rescue. There were bit parts in cowboy shows such as Gunsmoke and Pony Express, and his small-screen appearances were enough to launch him into big-screen Westerns His swarthy looks - he had some Cherokee in his ancestry - saw him playing the title role in the 1966 film Navajo Joe, and there were parts in 100 Rifles and Sam Whiskey, the latter giving him a chance to show a talent for comedy. It was his role as Lewis Medlock in John Boorman's dark film Deliverance that made him a star. The film, which garnered three Oscar nominations, tells the story of four city dwellers who encounter some brutal locals while on a wilderness trip in Georgia. It was his role in Deliverance that made him a star In one scene Reynolds almost drowned piloting a canoe down a fast-flowing river. The producers had decided to save money by having the actors do their own stunts. Deliverance was a box-office success and his popularity with audiences soared. After a part in Woody Allen's Everything You Always Wanted To Know About Sex, he starred as the eponymous private investigator in Shamus. Reynolds became seen as something of a Hollywood sex symbol, an image he did much to promote when he posed nude across the centre pages of Cosmopolitan magazine in 1972. White Lightning saw him first appear as Robert ""Gator"" McKluskey, a role he would reprise three years later in the 1976 film Gator. The film revelled in its Southern roots. He stayed deep in the South for The Longest Yard. Shot in a Georgia prison, it featured Reynolds as a one-time pro footballer, imprisoned after a frantic car chase with police, who forms a team of prisoners, known as Mean Machine, to take on the guards at a football match. By the time Reynolds starred in the 1977 film Smokey and the Bandit, he was America's top box-office star, a position he would hold for a further five years. Smokey and the Bandit was a good old-fashioned car chase The film, essentially one long car chase, was originally planned as a low-budget B movie but Reynolds's involvement saw the studio pump millions of dollars into the project. It was money well spent as the film became the second highest-grossing film of 1977. It also introduced Reynolds to his co-star, Sally Field, and the two began a relationship during shooting. The film spawned two sequels, Smokey and the Bandit Ride Again and Smokey and the Bandit Part 3, although Reynolds only made a cameo appearance in the latter production, by which time the format looked to be on its last legs. Reynolds returned to a sports theme with Semi-Tough, set in the world of American football. Critical reviews were mixed but Reynolds received praise for his own performance. Sharky's Machine, in which he played a tough drugs enforcement officer, proved to be the turning point in his career. He had gained a reputation for being difficult to work with and for his womanising, which had seen him date, and dump, a string of female co-stars. He later admitted his behaviour had hurt his career. ""I think it's not good to have people think you are out every night and fooling around,"" he told Vanity Fair His fall from grace at the box office highlighted the fact that, although he had been earning millions, he had also been spending it. He bought a string of luxury properties, a private jet, a helicopter and a fleet of custom-built cars. His marriage to Loni Anderson ended in divorce and whopping legal bill He lost $20m dollars after two restaurant chains he invested in went bust and buying into the Tampa Bay Bandits, a team in the fledgling US Football League, proved a mistake when both team and league collapsed after three years. When he tried to sue his financial advisers he discovered he had, unknowingly, signed a document exonerating them from any responsibility. Having married and divorced the actress Judy Carne in the 1960s, he married actress Loni Anderson in 1988 at a lavish ceremony at his ranch. The relationship ended acrimoniously in 1993 among accusations of lavish spending (hers) and infidelity (his) which culminated in a costly court battle that kept the gossip sheets happy for months. Eventually he was forced to file for bankruptcy with his debts listed as more than $11m. His film career had a nudge back upwards with a part as a porn film director in Boogie Nights in 1997, which won him an Oscar nomination and brought him to a new audience that barely remembered his earlier career. Roles in Pups and Time of the Wolf proved he could still turn in a good performance. But his need to recoup some of his lost money saw him take almost any part that came along and he appeared in a number of howlers in the first decade of the 21st Century, including the dire Broken Bridges and Without a Paddle. But his financial problems failed to go away and, in 2014, he was forced to sell most of his assets including prized items from his films such as his Smokey and the Bandit jacket and a number of awards including his 1998 Golden Globe. Beset by money problems he was forced to sell much of his film memorabilia Burt Reynolds possessed an ability to stay the course despite a rollercoaster career that gained him a great deal of money and a lifestyle that saw much of it frittered away. But his six decades on the screen proved his charismatic appeal and his abilities as an actor. Perhaps it was also the refreshing honesty with which he reflected on the problems that had laid him low. Vanity Fair journalist Ned Zeman once asked Reynolds if he had any regrets. ""I would have spent more money and had a lot more fun,"" he replied. ""It's always possible to spend more money.""

"Russian nationals Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov have been named as suspects in the Salisbury poisoning If Russia does feel under pressure since British police named the two suspects in the Salisbury poisoning, it's not showing it. From the start, Moscow has always denied having anything to do with the nerve agent attack, demanding evidence. It is continuing that denial now,even after the UK has set out its evidence in detail. Russia's response is peppered with a hefty dose of scorn, transmitted faithfully by state-controlled media. Commentators have dismissed London's case as ""fantasy"". One newspaper proclaimed the detailed reconstruction of the two suspects' movements in Britain as reminiscent of a ""cheap soap opera, not the work of an intelligence agency"". Another called it closer to a poor political thriller than the truth. On social media too, Kremlin-friendly accounts have rubbished the idea that Russian agents would be so incompetent as to be caught on camera together in broad daylight. What happened to the Skripals? And as before when accused of something huge - whether interfering in elections, helping stage a coup or shooting down a passenger plane - Russian officials have opted for distraction as well as denial. They like to focus in deep on tiny details, to sow doubts. One such chance came this time with two screenshots of the suspects identified by British police. Taken from CCTV footage at Gatwick Airport security gates, the images each had an on-screen clock that seemed to show both men in the same place at the same time. Foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova dived in to accuse UK officials of ""divine-level trolling"". When social media users pointed out that the Gatwick security area has parallel corridors, she switched tack. ""Why should we have to figure out the inconsistencies?""Ms Zakharova demanded to know on her Facebook page,external, before accusing the British authorities of withholding all sorts of information from Russia. The result, she said, was an investigation that's one ""big fake"". Amongst those Russians who even care are plenty who seem to agree with her. Many others are more worried about inflation and a plan to delay retirement than an attack on an ex-spy who betrayed his country. Sergei Skripal: Who is the former Russian colonel? As for the Kremlin, Vladimir Putin's spokesman on Thursday upbraided British officials, including Theresa May, for linking Russia's president directly to the Salisbury attack. ""Neither the highest leadership, nor lower ranked leaders, nor any official representative had anything to do with it,"" Dmitry Peskov stressed, describing all claims to the contrary as unacceptable. His tone, though, sounded more weary than strident. This video can not be played On the trail of Russians Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, who UK police believe carried out a nerve agent attack in Salisbury in March 2018 It seems unlikely the two suspects themselves will surface any time soon, if they are military intelligence agents from the GRU. Mr Peskov said Russian officials would not be seeking to ""identify"" the men, even to disprove the UK's claims of their involvement. Could Novichok attack suspects be returned to the UK? A lot of the tough talk on this case is clearly aimed at a domestic audience: claims of anti-Russian campaigns do help feed a siege mentality. Even so, officials must be bracing for the consequences. The US already increased trade sanctions on Russia last monthas punishment for the Salisbury attack. Under their terms, if Moscow doesn't stop using chemical weapons and admit inspectors to check that by late November, then further - far more punishing - sanctions kick in. They could include banning Russian flights to the US and deeper trade and financial restrictions. Officials here are already insisting that was the intention with the Skripal poisoning all along. They paint the Novichok attack as an elaborate plot to frame Russia, punish it with sanctions - and so humiliate and weaken a dangerous enemy. This from the country that accuses Britain of scripting fantasies, soap opera and thriller plots. Is Russia really interfering in European states?

"This video can not be played Britain's representative Karen Pierce and her Russian counterpart Vasily Nebenzya addressed the UN The US, France, Germany and Canada have agreed with the UK's assessment that Russia's government ""almost certainly"" approved the Salisbury poisoning. They have urged Russia to provide full disclosure of its Novichok programme. At a UN Security Council meeting to discussthe attack, Russia dismissed evidence presented by the UK as ""lies"". The head of GCHQ has said the UK's allies would ""reject the Kremlin's brazen determination to undermine the international rules-based order"". In a speech in Washington, Jeremy Fleming said: ""The threat from Russia is real. It's active."" He added: ""And it will be countered by a strong international partnership of allies. Able to deploy the full range of tools from across our national security apparatus."" Mr Fleming said the intelligence community had supported police in a ""painstaking"" and ""highly complex"" investigation into what happened after the poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury on 4 March. The UKnamed two men, Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, believed to be from Russia's military intelligence service, the GRU, as the main suspects. The Kremlin called these accusations ""unacceptable"". Russian spy: What we know so far Russia's scorn for 'cheap soap opera' Could suspects be returned to the UK? What happened to the Skripals? A statement from Theresa May, Emmanuel Macron, Angela Merkel, Donald Trump and Justin Trudeau said: ""We, the leaders of France, Germany, the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, reiterate our outrage at the use of a chemical nerve agent, known as Novichok, in Salisbury on March 4."" The leaders welcomed progress in the investigation, but urged those with more information to go to UK authorities. ""We have full confidence in the British assessment that the two suspects were officers from the Russian military intelligence service, also known as the GRU,"" the statement added. Referring to the expulsion of Russian diplomats from their countries in response to the 4 March attack, the leaders said they had already ""taken action together to disrupt the activities of the GRU"". The leaders said the link to the Russian service - revealed on Wednesday - would strengthen their intention to work together against foreign spy networks, the use of chemical weapons, and to ""defend ourselves from all forms of malign state activity directed against us and our societies"". This video can not be played What do we know about the Russian intelligence organisation, the GRU? The UN Security Council, of which Russia is a permanent member, alongside China and UK allies the US and France, met in New York to discuss the latest progress in the investigation. Addressing the council, Britain's ambassador to the UN Karen Pierce, said the nerve agent attack was a ""direct challenge"" to the ""rules-based international system that has kept all of us safe since 1945"". In a lengthy rebuttal, Russia accused the UK of ""disgusting anti-Russian hysteria"". But Russian ambassador to the UN, Vasily Nebenzya, accused the British authorities of ""Russiaphobia"" and misleading the international community and UK citizens. ""We have lost all hope in finding the truth,"" he said, adding that the latest developments were ""invented out of thin air"". He highlighted a number of so-called ""inconsistencies"", which he said were ""off the charts"", in the UK's evidence. Theresa May told the Commons on Wednesday that the two suspects had entered the UK on Russian passports. She told MPs the poisoning was ""not a rogue operation"" and was ""almost certainly"" approved at a senior level of the Russian state. Prosecutors in the UK believe there is sufficient evidence to charge the pair with offences including conspiracy to murder; attempted murder and the use and possession of Novichok contrary to the Chemical Weapons Act. Police released CCTV showing the two men arriving at Gatwick Airport on 2 March Russia does not extradite its nationals, but a European Arrest Warrant has been obtained in case the men travel to the EU. Mr Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, werepoisoned with Novichokon 4 March. Det Sgt Nick Bailey also fell ill after responding to the incident in Salisbury. Police have also linked the attack to a separate Novichok poisoning on 30 June in nearby Amesbury, that led to the death of 44-year-old mother-of-three Dawn Sturgess and harmed her friend Charlie Rowley.

"The chief executive of the hospital trust said staff would continue to work hard to reassure the CQC and patients ""Urgent enforcement action"" has been taken against a hospital trust after an inspection highlighted safety fears. The Care Quality Commission (CQC) inspected Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital Trust last week amid claims of staff shortages. It means the watchdog has the ability to suspend the trust's registration or impose restrictions on it. The trust, which has 28 days to appeal against the notice, said it will ""work hard to reassure the CQC and patients"". The trust was already under investigation over allegations ofdozens of avoidable deaths and injuries in its maternity unit. More stories from Midlands Live The latest notice primarily applies to the systems in place ""around patients who may present with sepsis or other deteriorating medical conditions in Emergency Departments and the environmental safety of our Emergency Department at the Princess Royal Hospital"", Chief Executive Simon Wright said in a statement. ""Work on identified areas had already begun before this notification and we will continue to work hard in these areas to reassure the CQC, and therefore our patients and staff, that these procedures are in place"", Mr Wright added. The notice primarily affects the trust's Emergency Departments, the chief executive said Heidi Smoult, the CQC's deputy chief inspector of hospitals, said last month's inspection ""identified concerns regarding patient safety"". ""We have now taken urgent enforcement action against the trust to ensure that people always get the care and treatment they have every right to expect."" By Michael Buchanan, BBC News There's a sense of inevitability about the CQC action. The trust's A&E performance has been struggling for years, with patients and health bosses in Shropshire becoming increasingly concerned. The trust has also struggled to hire staff, both consultants and junior doctors; it recently conducted interviews by Skype with eight doctors in India. In a recent survey staff scored the trust poorly on ""care for patients is our top priority"" and ""I would recommend this organisation as a place to work or receive care"". The CQC action comes as the trust is under intense pressure over its maternity services with allegations that dozens of babies died unnecessarily or suffered avoidable harm due to errors. The trust's defensive response to that, coupled with these problems in its A&E department, will put more pressure on the senior leadership team. Last week, an A&E nurse resigned from the trust citing safety reasons, prompting the chief executive to say staff shortages were unsustainable, and that the situation was ""very fragile"". As well as a long-standing shortage of A&E consultants there is also a significant shortage of both nurses and middle-grade doctors. Last weekfunding was secured to build a new Â£3m ward at Princess Royal Hospitalin Telford following CQC concerns about patients being treated in corridors. Patients were ""competing for beds"" at the trust's hospitals,a consultant revealed.

"The US and UK said in December that North Korea was responsible for the malware attack US prosecutors have charged a North Korean man alleged to have been involved in creating the malicious software used to cripple the UKâs National Health Service. The 2017 incident left NHS staff reverting to pen and paper after being locked out of computer systems. Park Jin Hyok is said to be linked to the Lazarus Group. The hacking collective is also blamed for the hack on Sony Pictures in 2014. The US Department of Justice alleged the North Korean-backed cyber group had caused major damage. ""The scale and scope of the cyber-crimes alleged by the complaint is staggering and offensive to all who respect the rule of law and the cyber norms accepted by responsible nations,â said the Assistant Attorney General for National Security, John Demers. âThe complaint alleges that the North Korean government, through a state-sponsored group; robbed a central bank and citizens of other nations; retaliated against free speech in order to chill it half a world away; and created disruptive malware that indiscriminately affected victims in more than 150 other countries, causing hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollarsâ worth of damage.â North Korea routinely denies being involved in hack attacks attributed to them. Mr Park is charged with one count of conspiracy to commit computer fraud and abuse, and wire fraud. Prosecutors said Mr Park was believed to be in North Korea. ""North Korea won't be handing over this guy any time soon,"" said Martyn Williams, a North Korea observer and journalist. ""So it likely won't mean much on that level, but it is a symbolic step for the US government to take. ""It helps put meat on the bones of the numerous reports that said North Korea was responsible and is a relatively rare move for the US government."" The attribution of cyber-attacks is often very difficult because of the ability of skilled hackers to hide their tracks. The 180-page complaint document,externalgoes into detail about why US prosecutors believe Mr Park was heavily involved in the targeted action. It attempts to join the dots by linking various social media aliases with email accounts later used to target those in the financial and entertainment industries. The document includes screenshots of fake emails designed to look like legitimate notes from Facebook, prompting a user to ""simply log in again"" to verify an account. Following the link would bring the victim to a spoof site designed to covertly collect their credentials. Another example was a screenshot of an email from a ""college student"" seeking to send her resume to a Sony Pictures executive - the accompanying link brought the victim to a malicious site. Not all of the group's work was successful, however. The FBI said it had found evidence of a failed attempt to gain access to defence contractor Lockheed Martin. British police assisted the FBI with its investigation. ""The collaboration between UK and US law enforcement has been strong and effective,"" said Steve Rodhouse, head of operations at the National Crime Agency. ""And these charges show that we will not tire in our efforts to identify those who believe they can hide behind a computer and cause havoc across the world, regardless of their motivation or status.""

"British Airways's boss has apologised for what he says was a sophisticated breach of the firm's security systems, and has promised compensation. Alex Cruz told the BBC that hackers carried out a ""sophisticated, malicious criminal attack"" on its website. The airline said personal and financial details of customers making or changing bookings had been compromised. About 380,000 transactions were affected, but the stolen data did not include travel or passport details. ""We are 100% committed to compensate them, period,"" Mr Cruz told the BBC's Today programme. ""We are committed to working with any customer who may have been financially affected by this attack, and we will compensate them for any financial hardship that they may have suffered."" BA said the breach took place between 22:58 BST on 21 August and 21:45 BST on 5 September.  Shares in BA parent group IAG closed 1.4% lower on Friday. Mr Cruz also told the Today programme: ""We're extremely sorry. I know that it is causing concern to some of our customers, particularly those customers that made transactions over BA.com and app. ""We discovered that something had happened but we didn't know what it was [on Wednesday evening]. So overnight, teams were trying to figure out the extent of the attack. This video can not be played British Airways' chairman and CEO says affected customers will be 100% compensated ""The first thing was to find out if it was something serious and who it affected or not. The moment that actual customer data had been compromised, that's when we began immediate communication to our customers."" BA said all customers affected by the breach had been contacted on Thursday night.  The breach only affects people who bought tickets during the timeframe provided by BA, and not on other occasions. Mr Cruz added: ""At the moment, our number one purpose is contacting those customers that made those transactions to make sure they contact their credit card bank providers so they can follow their instructions on how to manage that breach of data."" The airline has taken out adverts apologising for the breach in Friday's newspapers. By Simon Read, business reporter What data was stolen? ""It was name, email address, credit card information - that would be credit card number, expiration date and the three digit [CVV] code on the back of the credit card,"" said BA boss Mr Cruz. BA insists it did not store the CVV numbers.  This is prohibited under international standards set out by the PCI Security Standards Council. Since BA said the attackers also managed to obtain CVV numbers, security researchers have speculated that the card details were intercepted, rather than harvested from a BA database. How did hackers get in? It isn't totally clear how hackers boarded BA's website and app - but cyber-security experts have some suggestions. How did hackers get into British Airways? What could the hackers do with the data? Once fraudsters have your personal information, they may be able to access your bank account, or open new accounts in your name, or use your details to make fraudulent purchases. They could also sell on your details to other crooks. What do I need to do? If you've been affected, you should change your online passwords. Then monitor your bank and credit card accounts keeping an eye out for any dodgy transactions. Also be very wary of any emails or calls asking for more information to help deal with the data breach: crooks often pose as police, banks or, in this instance they could pretend to be from BA. Will my booking be affected? BA says none of the bookings have been hit by the breach.  It said it has contacted all those affected to alert them to the problem with their data, but booked flights should go ahead. Will there be compensation for me? If you suffer any financial loss or hardship, the airline has promised to compensate you. Jorg Herrera, from Amersham in Buckinghamshire, received an email from BA last night having booked tickets with the airline last month. ""I have six cards linked to my BA account,"" he told the BBC. ""I have no idea how much of my information has been stolen. ""I will have to go to each of my credit card providers, cancel the cards, and all the direct debits, etc, related to those cards. This will take a long time, something I have to do with no help from BA. ""This whole thing is terribly concerning and really annoying."" BA could potentially face fines from the Information Commissioner's Office, which is looking into the breach. Rachel Aldighieri, managing director of the Direct Marketing Association, said: ""British Airways has a duty to ensure their customer data is always secure. They need to show that they have done everything possible to ensure such a breach won't happen again. ""The risks go far beyond the fines regulators can issue - albeit that these could be hefty under the new [EU data protection] GDPR regime."" Under GDPR, fines can be up to 4% of annual global revenue. BA's total revenue in the year to 31 December 2017 was Â£12.226bn, so that could be a potential maximum of Â£489m. The National Crime Agency and National Cyber Security Centre also confirmed they were assessing the incident. This is not the first customer relations problem to affect the airline in recent times. In July, BA apologised afterIT issues caused dozens of flights in and out of Heathrow Airport to be cancelled. The month before,more than 2,000 BA passengers had their tickets cancelledbecause the prices were too cheap. And in May 2017, problems with BA's IT systems led to thousands of passengers having their plans disrupted, afterall flights from Heathrow and Gatwick were cancelled. ""It does not indicate that the information systems are the most robust in the airline industry,"" Simon Calder, travel editor at the Independent, told the BBC. However, he does not think BA will be affected in the long term by the breach. ""The airline has immense strength. Notably it's holding a majority of slots at Heathrow, and an enviable safety record, so while this is embarrassing and will potentially cost tens of millions of pounds to resolve, it's more like another flesh wound for BA, rather than anything serious.""

"CÃ©cile Djunga has been presenting the weather on Belgian public TV for a year, and after being subjected to a stream of racist comments she has decided to fight back.

The video went viral, viewed by a million people. Her employer, RTBF, has given full backing to its presenter. Its head, Jean-Paul Philippot, told Belgian radio on Thursday that Ms Djunga had passed on a string of messages she had received in recent months and had not reacted to them. ""There's no place for this torrent of mud in Belgium,"" he said. ""Racism is a crime, punishable by law."" As well as being a weather presenter on Belgium's French-language public TV, CÃ©cile Djunga has carved out a career as a stand-up comic, with a show called Almost Famous. In her Facebook appeal she starts off saying ""if you want a good laugh, I've got a good one for you today"", before talking about the woman who rang in to say she was ""too black"".

"The Cranberries front woman Dolores O'Riordan died by drowning due to alcohol intoxication, an inquest at Westminster Coroner's Court has heard. The singer,who died suddenly on 15 January aged 46, was found submerged in the bath in her room at London's Park Lane Hilton hotel. O'Riordan died as a result of a ""tragic accident"", the coroner said. She had no injuries or evidence of self harm, and had drunk an excessive amount of alcohol, expert witnesses said. She had been in the Park Lane Hilton hotel as part of a recording trip ahead of a 2018 tour. PC Natalie Smart, who attended the scene, told the inquest: ""I saw Mrs O'Riordan submerged in the bath with her nose and mouth fully under the water."" The inquest heard that there were empty bottles in the room - five miniature bottles and a bottle of champagne - as well as containers of prescription drugs with a quantity of tablets in each container. Dolores O'Riordan: Voice of a rebel The tragedy that inspired Zombie Toxicology tests showed only ""therapeutic"" amounts of medication in O'Riordan's blood, but showed up 330mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood - meaning she was more than four times over the 80mg legal limit for driving. The inquest was attended by O'Riordan's mother, brother and sister-in-law. She  split from her husband of 20 years, Don Burton, in 2014. She and Burton, who is the former tour manager of Duran Duran, have three children together. The band's 2017 tour had to be cancelled due to O'Riordan's health issues The inquest heard that the singer checked into the hotel on 14 January. She was in touch with room service at around midnight and phoned her mother at around 03:00 GMT. She was later found unresponsive in the bathroom and confirmed dead at 09:16. The inquest heard that O'Riordan had bipolar disorder but responded well to treatment. The hearing was also told that she went through periods of abstention and periods of excessive drinking.

"Two Russian men suspected of the attempted murder of former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, will not be extradited from Russia to be tried in the UK. That's because it is written into the Russian constitution that its citizens may not be extradited to another state. But if either of the suspects sets foot in any EU member state, they can then be brought to the UK under a mechanism called the European Arrest Warrant. If an EU country believes that someone suspected of having committed a crime has travelled to another member state, it can ask that state to arrest them. They must then be returned to the country that made the request, to be dealt with by its justice system. Use of this mechanism has risen steadily over the past 10 years. A European Arrest Warrant has already been issued for the two men, named as Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, suspected members of Russian military intelligence. The system means that extradition doesn't require a political decision in order for a suspect to be handed over, since EU countries can no longer refuse to surrender a suspect. Novichok attack Russian 'agents' named Russian spy: What happened to the Skripals? Before the process was introduced in 2004, extradition used to take an average of one year, but that has been cut to an average of 48 days, according to the European Commission. A suspect must be handed over within a maximum of 90 days after arrest. Between 2009 - when the data was first broken down by nationality - and 2017, two Russian nationals have been arrested and surrendered under a European Arrest Warrant at the request of the UK. One was wanted for fraud, the other for murder. In total in 2017, the UK made 278 requests for the return of individuals, leading to 201 arrests. Of those, 183 were eventually turned over to the UK. People wanted for child sex offences made up the largest group of wanted offenders, followed by murder and manslaughter. Use of the European Arrest Warrant has increased steadily over the past decade But the largest group actually arrested was wanted for ""offences against the person"", including assault, with the second largest group wanted for drug offences. Of all the people the UK requested that other EU states surrender to it, by far the biggest group were UK nationals, followed by Polish nationals. UK citizens suspected of crimes can also be extradited from the UK to other EU countries. In 2017, EU countries made 16,837 extradition requests, resulting in 1,510 arrests and 1,164 surrenders of suspects to be tried in other jurisdictions. Low-value theft and drug offences were the common reasons for these requests. And by far the most requests were made by Poland. The UK has said it wants to continue to be part of the scheme after Brexit, but it's not clear whether this will be possible. What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

"CÃ©cile Djunga has been presenting the weather on Belgian public TV for a year, and after being subjected to a stream of racist comments she has decided to fight back. In a five-minute appeal on Facebook, Ms Djunga says one viewer rang into work to complain she was ""too black and all people could see were my clothes"". The video went viral, viewed by a million people. Her employer, RTBF, has given full backing to its presenter. Its head, Jean-Paul Philippot, told Belgian radio on Thursday that Ms Djunga had passed on a string of messages she had received in recent months and had not reacted to them. ""There's no place for this torrent of mud in Belgium,"" he said. ""Racism is a crime, punishable by law."" As well as being a weather presenter on Belgium's French-language public TV, CÃ©cile Djunga has carved out a career as a stand-up comic, with a show called Almost Famous. In her Facebook appeal she starts off saying ""if you want a good laugh, I've got a good one for you today"", before talking about the woman who rang in to say she was ""too black"". This complaint, she explained later, was for her the final straw. Allow Facebook content? This article contains content provided by Facebook.

""It doesn't stop. I've been doing this job for a year and I'm fed up of getting tonnes of racist and insulting messages... It hurts because I'm a human being."" Close to tears she goes on to say that some of the messages use racist words, telling her ""go back to your country"", adding that she chose to speak out because too many Belgians believed that racism did not exist there. CÃ©cile Djunga said she was overwhelmed by the support she had received. Speaking on Belgian TV late on Wednesday evening she said it was important to broaden the debate about racism and not focus just on her. Many people had told her of their own experience as victims of racism. Miss Belgium hits out at racist critics How do Belgian footballers speak to each other? Are adverts deliberately being racist? Ms Djunga's decision to go public received widespread support. Belgian footballer Christian Kabasele, who plays for Watford in the English Premier League, praised her on Twitter.

"Michel Barnier and Dominic Raab are holding more negotiations in Brussels The EU has cast doubt on claims its chief negotiator described the government's Brexit plan as ""dead in the water"". Labour MP Stephen Kinnock attributed the remarks - which he said were in French - to Michel Barnier after a meeting in Brussels. EU Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas urged journalists to wait for a transcript to be published. The Chequers plan contains some ""positive elements"", he added. The UK is leaving the EU on 29 March 2019, and negotiations are taking place between the two sides. Snapshot of 'no deal' Brexit planning What's the Brexiteers' alternative plan? Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab has been meeting Mr Barnier for more negotiations as the two sides seek to reach an agreement before a summit in October. In July the government set out how it wants to trade with the EU - and avoid new border checks in Northern Ireland - after a summit at Chequers, the prime minister's country residence. But the plans have been criticised by Brexiteers and the government faces a battle to persuade Parliament to approve them, even if the EU agrees. On Monday Mr Barnier met members of the UK's Brexit Committee, which contains both pro and anti-EU MPs. After the meeting, Tory Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg said Mr Barnier had agreed with him that the Chequers plan was ""complete rubbish"" and on Wednesday Mr Kinnock told Mr Raab the EU negotiator said the package was ""dead in the water"". This video can not be played Labour's Stephen Kinnock said Mr Barnier described the Chequers plan as ""mort"" (which means dead in French) Challenged by Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab as to the exact wording used by Mr Barnier, Mr Kinnock switched to French, saying he had said: ""Les propositions sont mortes"" (the proposals are dead). The committee is expected to publish a transcript of the meeting in the coming days. Asked about the comments, Mr Schinas said Mr Barnier had been ""very clear"" in expressing the EU's position. ""I don't think that people present in the room and beyond the room have any doubt on what we said on Chequers - we identified where there were positive elements and we discussed also the possibility for further discussions to address issues that still create problems,"" he said. Mr Schinas said the private meeting provided ""the perfect recipe for everybody coming out of there and saying what one or the other understood Michel saying"". He added: ""Let's wait for the transcript and then let's check the sort of things that are reported of what Michel Barnier said against what he actually really said."" Meanwhile, a paper with details of planning for a no-deal Brexit has been caught on camera in Whitehall. It reveals government departments are expected to make cuts in other spending to prepare for the possibility of no deal being reached. Codenamed Operation Yellowhammer, it appears to be run by the Civil Contingencies Secretariat, which is responsible for emergency planning. The government says a deal with the EU is the most likely outcome. But it is also making contingency plans for leaving without one, and recently published a series of papers detailing preparations and offering advice. The document, captured by photographer Steve Back, was being carried by Treasury Minister John Glen as he left the Cabinet Office. Downing Street said civil contingencies planning happened routinely in advance of significant events, and that the yellowhammer name had been generated at random. Asked about the document during a visit to Strathclyde University, Chancellor Philip Hammond - who has previously warned about the economic impact of no deal being reached - said departments had the funding needed to plan for such a scenario. He added: ""In no deal circumstances we would have to refocus government priorities so that government was concentrated on the circumstances that we found ourselves in. ""Let me reiterate again that is not the outcome we are expecting and it's not the outcome we're seeking."" Analysis by BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg As an intellectual exercise, none of this brief excerpt is completely surprising. But it demonstrates the political reality that in government there is concern about what might happen to the financial system, what might happen to transport, air and rail, but still a message to government departments they should try to find cash to spend on 'no deal' preparations from existing budgets, rather than the big cash pot that's been allocated so far.

"This video can not be played Grenfell firefighter Desmond Murphy: ""I'm sorry we couldn't get your loved ones out"" A firefighter has personally apologised to families of residents on the 14th floor of Grenfell Tower who were told to stay put in the burning building. Desmond Murphy, a Kensington firefighter, told the public inquiry: ""I'm very sorry we couldn't get your loved ones out of the building."" Four of the eight residents advised to remain in flat 113 died that night. Mr Murphy said: ""If I had taken anyone down, it would have led them to a very early death. It was not safe."" Giving evidence at the inquiry into last June's fire at Grenfell Tower, Mr Murphy said he had come across Denis Murphy, who eventually died, in flat 111 on the 14th floor. He and his fellow firefighters found him struggling, with soot on his face. ""He was conscious and still breathing, he was bent over double and coughing,"" Mr Murphy said. His flat was filling with smoke and unsafe. As they led him out, two Syrian brothers - Mohammed and Omar al-Haj Ali - emerged from the neighbouring flat. Mr Murphy said: ""One was very, very calm - the other one was quite distressed and upset. He said: 'Please don't leave us.'"" They were told to take their neighbour into flat 111, which was clear of smoke while the firefighters checked the neighbouring flats. What happened at Grenfell Tower? Why was 'stay put' advice so disastrous? In flat 115, they found Zainab Deen and her two-year-old boy, Jeremiah. Ms Deen told Mr Murphy: ""Don't leave me on my own."" All the 14th floor residents were then moved into flat 113. But the firefighters, who were by now running low on air, had to leave for the lower floors, the inquiry heard. They took a headcount of the six adults and two children in the flat and passed the information on to their superiors. After his evidence, Mr Murphy asked to return to the hearing to make his apology. Trying hard to maintain his composure, he said: ""I would just like to say to the family members of Denis Murphy and the family members of the other seven residents I came into contact with on the 14th floor - I'm very sorry we couldn't get your loved ones out of the building."" Denis Murphy, 56, who died in the fire, was said to have three loves - his family, friends and Chelsea FC Civil engineering student Mohammed Al-Haj Ali died after becoming separated from Omar as they attempted to escape. An inquest found that he had injuries consistent with falling from a height. Zainab Deen and her son, Jeremiah, also died. In a written statement published by the inquiry, firefighter Murphy described the moments after he finished his shift. ""As I sat on the grass looking at the tower, it reminded me of when I worked at the terrorist attack at Edgware Road, I was in a trance. ""I had a mix of emotions. ""I felt pride and achievement of what we had been able to do on floor 14, but similarly I felt guilt and confusion for not being able to do enough - you question yourself."" He wrote he must have stared at the tower for an hour in the dark before taking himself to the toilets in the nearby leisure centre where he was physically sick. ""This hasn't happened before; it must have been the emotion of everything going on at that point,"" he said. Mohammed al-Haj Ali, who died aged 23, lived with his brother Omar on the 14th floor In the afternoon, the inquiry heard from Peter Herrera, a firefighter from Lambeth, who was allegedly told to rescue a family of three from the 14th floor, rather than the eight stranded residents. He said that once at the flat, he asked Omar al-Haj Ali whether anyone else was left in the flat and was told: ""No, I'm the last one."" ""I said 'let's go, let's go now, is this everyone?' and I got a 'yes - I'm not going to hang around.'"" In a written statement, Mr Herrera said: ""I did not search the flat as this man was clear that there was no-one else left in the premises."" But Omar al-Haj Ali said Mr Herrera's account was ""mistaken"" and denied the flat was empty. Mr Herrera insisted he did not ""make this up"" and closed his evidence saying he was ""very, very, very sorry"" if anyone thought he had failed them. The public inquiry continues.

"Mohamed Bangoura is due to start school in Sheffield on Monday A six-year-old boy has been left stranded and ""stateless"" in Belgium after he was denied permission to board a flight home, politicians have said. Mohamed Bangoura, who was born in Leeds, was travelling back to the UK with a family friend when his passport was rejected by Belgian authorities. An MEP and MP have written a joint letter to Home Secretary Sajid Javid, calling the boy's return ""imperative"". The Home Office said Mohamed's passport had been revoked as it was not valid. ""We will be in contact with the family in the next 24 hours to make arrangements for reuniting mother and son,"" a spokeswoman said. His mother Hawa Keita said: ""I am completely down, I can't see my son because he is stuck in another country. ""It's the most horrible thing that a mother can endure."" Mohamed told the BBC he wanted to ""go back to Sheffield - I miss my mum"". Hawa Keita was told by the Passport Office her son's passport ""was no longer valid"" Abdoul Diallo, a family friend, said Mohamed was depressed and did not want to eat. MEP Catherine Bearder and MP Sir Ed Davey said Mohamed, who is due to start school in Sheffield on Monday, was returning from a summer holiday visiting family friends in Brussels. More stories from Yorkshire In the letter,which the MEP posted on her Twitter account,external, the pair said the boy was ""currently stateless and stuck"" in the Belgian capital. The politicians said: ""All that matters is that we get a frightened six-year-old back to his mother."" The Home Office said Mohamed's mother, who is originally from Guinea but now lives in Sheffield, was told by the Passport Office in March her son's passport ""was no longer valid"". But Ms Keita ""insists she never received a registered letter by courier or by email"", the politicians said. Urging Mr Javid's ""personal intervention"", they said: ""We feel it is imperative to get this child on a flight to Manchester right away. ""Whatever error has been made on whoever's side, we must bring this child home now and reunite him with his worried mother,"" the MP and MEP added. The Home Office spokeswoman said Mohamed was only entitled to British citizenship through his mother or her husband, but neither was settled in the UK when he was born. ""We understand that despite this Mohamed was taken out of the UK in July and last Sunday was unable to re-enter as he did not hold a valid passport,"" she added. Immigration lawyer Julian Bild said it ""seems extremely harsh to take away the passport the child is ultimately entitled to"". ""It's just incredible,"" he said. ""Why on earth didn't the Home Office let the child back on his passport and sort it out back here? ""It's inconceivable the child was given no route to come back to the UK. The law says the Home Office must act in the best interest of the child.""

"Several members of Donald Trump's cabinet have denied writing the editorial A number of top US officials have denied that they are the author of a damning anonymous editorial that attacks President Donald Trump. The New York Times article, said to be written by a senior White House official, saysMr Trump's appointees are trying to stifle his agenda,external. There is fierce speculation over who is responsible - with the vice-president among those to deny any involvement. Mr Trump has described the writer as ""gutless"" and the newspaper as ""phony"". A spokesman for Vice-President Mike Pence has dismissed claims that he wrote the op-ed,external, describing it as ""false, illogical and gutless"". The Whodunnit editorial puzzling Washington Does 'lodestar' guide us to Trump author? Several other cabinet members and top officials have also denied writing the piece. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo attacked the writer as a ""disgruntled deceptive bad actor"", adding: ""I come from a place where if you're not in a position to execute the commander's intent, you have a singular option - that is to leave."" Meanwhile, a spokesman for Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin described the anonymous piece as ""irresponsible"", while a spokesman for the Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen said: ""These types of political attacks are beneath the secretary and the department's mission"". Anonymous Trump op-ed passes key tests Linguistic clues to NYT insider? The article - entitled I Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration - is written by someone the New York Times describes as a senior official in the Trump administration. The paper says the author requested anonymity and that this was essential to deliver an ""important perspective"" to its readers. ""Many of the senior officials in his own administration are working diligently from within to frustrate parts of his agenda and his worst inclinations,"" the article says. ""I would know. I am one of them."" Although the writer says they support the administration's objectives, they say that its successes have come in spite of the president, who is described as impulsive, erratic and amoral, someone whose ""misguided impulses"" need to be controlled for the good of the US. ""It may be cold comfort in this chaotic era, but Americans should know that there are adults in the room. We fully recognise what is happening. And we are trying to do what's right even when Donald Trump won't,"" it says. Angrily. One of Mr Trump's tweets simply said ""TREASON?"".

"This video can not be played No deal Brexit papers revealed by @politicalpics It's good and sensible to plan. If they weren't taking it seriously, as the government was very regularly criticised for failing to do, careering into a 'no deal' scenario would be pretty irresponsible, and planning properly for no deal has also been prized by Brexiteers as evidence that the PM might actually walk away if the offer on the table is simply not good enough. A literal snapshot of some of that planning today has given a slice of insight into the kind of preparation that's taking place inside the Treasury, so called 'Operation Yellowhammer'. As an intellectual exercise, none of this brief excerpt is completely surprising. It demonstrates the political reality that in government there is concern about what might happen to the financial system, as well as transport, air and rail. But it is still a message to government departments they should try to find cash to spend on ""no deal"" preparations from existing budgets, rather than the big cash pot that's been allocated so far. That could give yet another reason for Brexiteers to get riled. But in this hot political climate, that's not hard to do. The Treasury officially won't comment on the leak. Here is the text of the snap, captured by the sharp-eyed Westminster photographer@politicalpics,external: HMT briefing - Operation Yellowhammer - 04 September 2018 Operation Yellowhammer: no deal contingency planning Summary of issue â¢This meeting will consider progress on the Government's plans for mitigating the immediate impacts of a No Deal Brexit. â¢The Civil Contingencies Secretariat held a two-day workshop last week to review departments' plans, assumptions, interdependencies and next steps. HMT objectives 1.Emphasise the importance of building XWH [cross Whitehall] communications architecture that can help maintain confidence in the event of contingency plans being triggered - particularly important for financial services. 2.Explain that departments should be raising Yellowhammer costs through the normal channels - through their spending teams for in-year pressures, and in their bids for 19/20 Brexit allocations for spending that year. Their first call should be internal prioritisation. 3.Reaffirm the need for consistent planning assumptions across plans [â¦] aviation and rail access to the EU. 4.Remind departments of the need to consider the financial [â¦] commercial firms that play a role in their contingency plans.

"The HMS Albion was conducting a freedom of navigation exercise China has accused the UK of ""provocative actions"", after a British warship sailed close to the disputed Paracel islands in the South China Sea. The Chinese told HMS Albion to leave in ""an aggressive manner"", taking position ""irresponsibly close"" to the ship, the BBC's Jonathan Beale has been told. The Royal Navy said it was conducting a freedom of navigation exercise ""in full compliance with international law"". But China said the UK had entered its territorial waters without permission. A source told the BBC that a Chinese warship tailed the Albion from just 200 metres, while Chinese jets flew low over the British warship during the encounter. The Paracels are controlled by China but also claimed by Vietnam and Taiwan. China's definition of the 12-mile limit around the islands is not the same as those limits which have been internationally recognised. The UK Ministry of Defence has insisted the Albion was always in international waters. Details of the challenge have not been made public, but both sides are said to have remained calm during the encounter on 31 August. HMS Albion, an 18,000 tonne amphibious warship carrying a contingent of Royal Marines, then docked at Ho Chi Minh City, in Vietnam, on Monday. Why is the South China Sea contentious What does Paracel island look like? 'Leave immediately and keep far off' The naval stand-off comes at a time when the UK is courting China in the hope of securing a favourable post-Brexit trade deal. In a statement to news agency Reuters,external, China's foreign ministry said HMS Albion had ""infringed on China's sovereignty"". ""China strongly opposes this and has lodged stern representations with the British side to express strong dissatisfaction,"" it said. It said Beijing urged the UK to ""immediately stop such provocative actions, to avoid harming the broader picture of bilateral relations and regional peace and stability."" China's territorial claims in the South China Sea have long been a source of dispute, with Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan, Malaysia and Brunei all contesting its actions. The sea is a major shipping route and home to abundant fishing grounds that supply the livelihoods of people across the region. It is also home to two largely uninhabited island chains - the Paracels and the Spratlys - which are said to have reserves of various natural resources around them. China claims by far the largest portion of territory - an area defined by the ""nine-dash line"" which stretches hundreds of miles south and east from its most southerly province of Hainan. It has backed its expansive claims with island-building and naval patrols. However, a landmark judgement at the Hague in 2016 criticised Chinese actions in the South China Sea and found no basis for its sweeping historical claims. China called the ruling ""ill-founded"" and said it would not be bound by it. This video can not be played Rupert Wingfield-Hayes says China is determined to assert its control China frequently challenges foreign vessels in the South China Sea. Since 2015, the US Navy has been conducting freedom of navigation operations (FONOPs) in the area to ensure access to key shipping and air routes - and has urged key international allies to do the same. China has accused Washington of militarising the region. Last month, the UK Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson gave a speech in Washington in which he said China needed to recognise and abide by international norms. FONOPs - as they are known - challenge territorial claims on the world's oceans and maintain international law. Both Britain and the US conduct such operations throughout the world.

"Two Russian men suspected of the attempted murder of former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, will not be extradited from Russia to be tried in the UK. That's because it is written into the Russian constitution that its citizens may not be extradited to another state. But if either of the suspects sets foot in any EU member state, they can then be brought to the UK under a mechanism called the European Arrest Warrant. If an EU country believes that someone suspected of having committed a crime has travelled to another member state, it can ask that state to arrest them. They must then be returned to the country that made the request, to be dealt with by its justice system. Use of this mechanism has risen steadily over the past 10 years. A European Arrest Warrant has already been issued for the two men, named as Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, suspected members of Russian military intelligence. The system means that extradition doesn't require a political decision in order for a suspect to be handed over, since EU countries can no longer refuse to surrender a suspect. Novichok attack Russian 'agents' named Russian spy: What happened to the Skripals? Before the process was introduced in 2004, extradition used to take an average of one year, but that has been cut to an average of 48 days, according to the European Commission. A suspect must be handed over within a maximum of 90 days after arrest. Between 2009 - when the data was first broken down by nationality - and 2017, two Russian nationals have been arrested and surrendered under a European Arrest Warrant at the request of the UK. One was wanted for fraud, the other for murder. In total in 2017, the UK made 278 requests for the return of individuals, leading to 201 arrests. Of those, 183 were eventually turned over to the UK. People wanted for child sex offences made up the largest group of wanted offenders, followed by murder and manslaughter. Use of the European Arrest Warrant has increased steadily over the past decade But the largest group actually arrested was wanted for ""offences against the person"", including assault, with the second largest group wanted for drug offences. Of all the people the UK requested that other EU states surrender to it, by far the biggest group were UK nationals, followed by Polish nationals. UK citizens suspected of crimes can also be extradited from the UK to other EU countries. In 2017, EU countries made 16,837 extradition requests, resulting in 1,510 arrests and 1,164 surrenders of suspects to be tried in other jurisdictions. Low-value theft and drug offences were the common reasons for these requests. And by far the most requests were made by Poland. The UK has said it wants to continue to be part of the scheme after Brexit, but it's not clear whether this will be possible. What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

"This video can not be played ""I'm finally glad I can say I'm not a criminal in this country anymore"" In a historic decision, India's Supreme Court has ruled that gay sex is no longer a criminal offence. The ruling overturns a 2013 judgement that upheld a colonial-era law, known as section 377, under which gay sex is categorised as an ""unnatural offence"". The court has now ruled discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is a fundamental violation of rights. Campaigners outside the court cheered and some broke down in tears as the ruling was handed down. Although public opinion in India's biggest cities has been in favour of scrapping the law, there remains strong opposition among religious groups and in conservative rural communities. Joy in India as gay sex legalised The privacy case that paved the way How previous ruling shocked the gay community Where is gay sex still against the law? But this ruling, from the top court, is the final say in the matter and represents a huge victory for India's LGBT community. One activist outside the court told the BBC: ""I hadn't come out to my parents until now. But today, I guess I have."" Thursday's decision was delivered by a five-judge bench headed by India's outgoing chief justice Dipak Misra and was unanimous. Reading out the judgement, he said: ""Criminalising carnal intercourse is irrational, arbitrary and manifestly unconstitutional."" Another judge, Indu Malhotra, said she believed ""history owes an apology"" to LGBT people for ostracising them. Justice DY Chandrachud said the state had no right to control the private lives of LGBT community members and that the denial of the right to sexual orientation was the same as denying the right to privacy. The ruling effectively allows gay sex among consenting adults in private. It is a 157-year-old colonial-era law which criminalises certain sexual acts as ""unnatural offences"" that are punishable by a 10-year jail term. A joyful reaction to the ruling at an NGO in Mumbai The law punishes, in its own words, ""carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man, woman or animal"". While the statute criminalises all anal and oral sex, it has largely affected same-sex relationships. Human rights groups say police have used the statute to harass and abuse members of the LGBT community. Geeta Pandey, BBC News, Delhi Even though it was rarely invoked when it involved consenting adults, section 377 could be - and was sometimes - used as a tool for harassment. It is not surprising then that campaigners are describing the verdict as a ""new dawn for personal liberty"". But in a largely conservative India, where leaders of all religions have consistently opposed gay sex, it will still be a while before attitudes change and the community finds full acceptance. But laws almost always play an important role in changing mindsets, and by recognising the community's right to love, the Supreme Court has restored the dignity denied to them for a very long time. It's been a tortuous route. A bid to repeal section 377 was initiated in 2001 and was batted between court and government until 2009, when the Delhi High Court ruled in favour of decriminalisation. This video can not be played The power of ""pink money"" in India Several political, social and religious groups then mobilised to restore the law and in 2013 the Supreme Court struck down the High Court ruling. Anti-section 377 activists then submitted a ""curative petition"" - a formal request to review an earlier court order perceived as a ""miscarriage of justice"" - and in 2016 the Supreme Court decided to revisit its ruling. One of joy given that the community has fought vigorously to strike down the law. Activists say they are elated at the change although more needs to be done Equal rights activists had argued that the very existence of such a law was proof of discrimination based on sexual orientation. LGBT activist Harish Iyer told the BBC: ""I'm absolutely elated. It's like a second freedom struggle where finally we have thrown a British law out of this country...  I think the next step would be to get anti-discrimination laws in place, or anti-bullying laws.""

The governing BJP party has said it would leave the decision to the Supreme Court. However, one of its members said he was disappointed with the verdict. Subramanian Swamy, known for making provocative comments, said: ""It could give rise to an increase in the number of HIV cases."" Meanwhile, the main opposition Congress party has welcomed the ruling, saying they ""hope this is the beginning of a more equal and inclusive society"". The UN has also welcomed the ruling, saying ""sexual orientation and gender expression form an integral part of an individual's identity the world over"". The court said other aspects of section 377 dealing with unnatural sex with animals and children would remain in force. The judges also explicitly said that they only ruled on the constitutional validity of section 377 and were not looking at it in terms of other rights such as those related to marriage or inheritance. It remains too early to say what this will translate to in the longer term. Author and commentator Sandip Roy told the BBC that although the ruling was a cause for celebration, there were still hurdles to overcome, and a need for anti-discrimination laws. ""I think we would be foolish to think that this is the end of the fight,"" he said. The 2017 report fromthe International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association (Ilga),externallists 72 countries and territories where same-sex relationships are still criminalised, although that includes India before its latest ruling. Most of them are in Africa, the Middle East and other parts of south Asia. The report said homosexuality could still result in the death penalty in eight nations. Where is gay sex still outlawed?

"Kayden was 20 months old when he died There was ""gross failure"" in the care of a toddler who died while awaiting emergency surgery, a coroner has said. Serious and basic failings led to an ""unacceptable delay"" in Kayden Urmston-Bancroft's operation on a diaphragmatic hernia, an inquest heard. Coroner Angharad Davies concluded the 20-month-old 's death of natural causes was ""contributed to by neglect"".

This video can not be played Kayden screamed in pain for days, said his grandmother Kayden, from Stockport, suffered a cardiac arrest at the hospital on 15 April 2016, three days after being admitted. He died two days later. The four-day inquest at Manchester town hall heard Kayden's death could have been prevented were it not for failings in his care. Ms Davies identified missed opportunities to perform the surgery and said there were ""a number of serious and basic failings which meant Kayden was not operated on that week"". The ""unacceptable delay"" in his surgery was ""sufficiently serious to amount to a gross failure"", she said. Surgeon 'apologised for toddler's death' Op delay toddler 'could have survived' Clinging to happy memories of Kayden Kayden was transferred from Stepping Hill Hospital and placed on an emergency surgery list, the inquest heard. His notes said there was no bed available in the children's hospital's high dependency unit (HDU), so he could not have the operation. Mother Shannon Bancroft was ""very upset"" at the delay, but her son's consultant said he remained well, the notes said. Kayden's mum Shannon Bancroft was left devastated by his death A report showed a bed was not requested until midday on 15 April, but records showed three had been available on that day. The inquest heard consultant Mohamed Shoukry thought the bed for Kayden had been taken by another emergency. Ms Davies said it was ""inexplicable"" as to why he was under the impression there was no HDU bed available, saying there was a ""basic, fundamental communication problem"". She also told the court there had been ""confusion"" over who the consultant with responsibility for Kayden's care had been. By Hugh Pym, Health Editor It is one of Britain's biggest and most prestigious children's hospitals - but a coroner has made the extremely rare ruling for an NHS trust that there was gross failure in the care of a young boy with neglect contributing to his death. The coroner, in her conclusion at the inquest, covered some of the factors at Royal Manchester Children's Hospital which had caused ""unacceptable delays"" in the urgent operation needed by Kayden Urmston-Bancroft. This included what she said were difficulties with the hospital's culture which could allow routine surgery to be prioritised over emergency cases. When the BBC uncovered the story last year there were claims that the waiting list had got too long and there was pressure to reduce it. Lawyers for Kayden's family have welcomed the ruling but urged all hospitals to look at their own procedures to ensure there are no more such avoidable deaths. During the inquest, hospital boss Sir Michael Deegan said it was likely Kayden would have survived but for failings in his care. In a letter read out at Wednesday's hearing, he apologised unreservedly for the ""unacceptable lapse of standards"". After the inquest concluded, Kayden's family said ""knowing that he could have been saved is hard to bear"". ""You take your child to hospital and you think everything will be alright, that they'll be able to make them better,"" they said. ""We put Kayden's life in their hands and they let us down in the worst way possible. ""We begged them to help him over and over, but instead we had to watch him fade away. ""He died in pain and that's the thing I don't think we can ever forgive"". Coroner Angharad Davies found the hospital made a ""number of serious and basic failings"" After the inquest, Prof Bob Pearson - former medical director of the hospital's trust - offered ""profound apologies"" to Kayden's family outside court. He said the trust launched a ""rigorous and wide-ranging"" investigation after the death and measures in place ""to make sure this does not happen again"".

"Sophia Reis told her bank of her name change last year A transgender woman said she ""felt humiliated"" after a bank froze her account because she sounded like a man. Sophia Reis, from Nottingham, was using Santander's telephone banking service when a member of staff said she could not access her money. The 46-year-old said a customer service adviser later told her the problem had arisen because of her voice. Santander said it has a ""duty to protect the security"" of accounts but apologised for any offence caused. East Midlands Live: Boy, 14, arrested on suspicion of murder; Alert over missing 14-year-old girls Ms Reis, who began transitioning in 2016, said she informed the bank of her name change in November. But last Thursday, despite providing all the correct security information over the telephone, her debit card and accounts were frozen until she visited a branch and provided ID. ""I felt embarrassed. I felt humiliated because yet again I have to explain myself,"" she said. ""For the first time in my life I felt embarrassed of who I am. ""I want for the bank, as an institution, to have something in place where people like myself get protected and don't have to go through this every time."" Ms Reis said the experience was ""the last straw"" Ms Reis said a member of staff had now placed a note on her account but said the problem could happen again. ""So what is the point if they can't guarantee that I'm not going to go through this again,"" she said. ""I have to make sure that every day no-one can complain about my appearance. I have to always be on the top of my game, always looking over my shoulder because at any point something can happen. ""And that shouldn't be the way anybody should live."" In a statement, Santander admitted its service ""was not as good as it should have been"" and wanted all customers ""to be treated equally and fairly"".

"This video can not be played Northern Ireland Assembly members' pay to be cut The Northern Ireland Secretary is to cut Stormont Assembly members' pay. Northern Ireland has been without an executive since January 2017 aftera bitter row between the governing parties, the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in. Karen Bradley has also ruled out calling a fresh Assembly election and she is to bring forward legislation to allow civil servants to make decisions in the absence of devolution. MLA pay will fall in November from Â£49,500 to Â£35,888. The cut will happen in two stages. The first cut of Â£7,425 will be followed by a further reduction of Â£6,187 in three months' time. Politicians have largely welcomed Karen Bradley's announcement. Who's calling the shots on NI policy? NI 'not eligible' for no government record Stormont deadlock: Need-to-know guide The pay cut was first suggested last December in a report written for the Northern Ireland Office by the former Assembly chief executive Trevor Reaney. He recommended a pay cut until a functioning executive is restored. Mrs Bradley made the announcement in the House of Commons. She told MPs: ""The reduction will take effect in two stages, commencing in November - it would not reduce the allowance for staff as I do not think that MLAs' staff should suffer because of the politicians' failure to form an Executive."" Northern Ireland has been without a functioning executive since January 2017 She also spoke about the issue of civil service decision making in the absence of an Executive. The secretary of state told MPs: ""I recognise that there is a need to provide reassurance and clarity to both the Northern Ireland Civil Service and the people of Northern Ireland on the mechanisms for the continued delivery of public services. ""So, the legislation I intend to introduce after the conference recess will also include provisions to give greater clarity and certainty to enable Northern Ireland departments to continue to take decisions in Northern Ireland in the public interest and to ensure the continued delivery of public services."" Mrs Bradley told BBC Radio Ulster that she had not made the announcement on Thursday to ""deflect"" attention fromformer DUP minister Jonathan Bell's appearance at the RHI Inquiryon the same day. The DUP and the Conservative Party are partners in a confidence and supply agreementat Westminster. Mrs Bradley said: ""I came to the House of Commons at the earliest possible opportunity to give this decision, which I took over the summer. ""I wanted to get here as quickly as possible."" Alliance party leader, Naomi Long, tweeted her approval of the announcement. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Meanwhile, DUP leader Arlene Foster issued a statement which said: ""The proposal to reduce the pay for MLAs is a sensible step as we are not able to fulfil our full role as legislators. ""The Secretary of State is right to guard against cuts to the pay and allowances for Members' staff."" Sinn FÃ©in said Mrs Bradley was ""acting under duress"" in a plan ""cobbled together at the last moment"". Newry and Armagh MLA Conor Murphy said he was ""bemused by talks of a talks process"" as his party have ""heard nothing"". Mr Murphy said that the promise of a court ordered elected ""prompted Karen Bradley to act"". The secretary of state also ruled out calling an election as she is required to do under current legislation. She told MPs: ""I have not believed and do not now believe that holding an election during this time of significant change and political uncertainty would be helpful or would increase the prospects of restoring the Executive."" She added: ""I intend, therefore, to introduce primary legislation in October to set aside for a limited and prescribed period the legal requirement to propose a date for a further election."" Northern Ireland's system of government, where power was shared between the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in, collapsed after a row over a flawed green energy scheme. DUP leader Arlene Foster was the minister at Stormont's Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (DETI) when it set upthe Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) schemein 2012, and in that role she signed off on the project. Critical flaws in the scheme meant that claimants of the scheme could earn substantial returns at the taxpayer's expense. The most recent estimate put the projected overspend at Â£700m over 20 years, up from an original figure of Â£490m. That led to a snap assembly election on 2 March 2017, which saw theDUP and Sinn FÃ©in re-emerge as the largest parties, but so far they have been unable to reach a deal to restore the institutions. Sinn FÃ©in wants an Irish language act but the DUP is opposed to that demand A big sticking point isSinn FÃ©in's demand for legislation to give official status to the Irish languagein Northern Ireland. The party has been frank and forthright in its insistence that Stormont will not get up and running again until a standalone act is agreed. Other issues, includingrights for same-sex couples to marryalso feature high on the agenda. Mrs Bradley is to have discussions with the local parties and the Irish government in the weeks ahead about political talks aimed at restoring devolution. The secretary of state said she would also seek the parties' views ""on when and how external facilitation"" should be used. There have been a number of calls for an independent talks chairperson to be appointed. Mrs Bradley said ""a functioning North-South Ministerial Council is vital to ensure NI makes the most of its unique position within the UK and in relation to Ireland.""

"This is the first time soldiers have been sentenced for committing atrocities in South Sudan A military court in South Sudan has sentenced 10 soldiers to jail terms ranging from seven years to life for a rampage in which a journalist was killed and foreign aid workers raped. The court also ordered South Sudan's government to pay each rape survivor $4,000 (Â£3,000) in compensation. The crimes were committed during an attack in the Terrain Hotel in the capital Juba in 2016. A UN report accused peacekeepers of failing to respond to pleas for help. South Sudan's military and rebel forces have been accused of committing numerous atrocities since the outbreak of a civil war in 2013, but this was the worst attack against foreigners. This is the first time soldiers have been sentenced for committing atrocities in South Sudan, the world's youngest nation, which only gained independence in 2011. Africa Live: More updates on this and other stories 'Soldiers will kill you for no reason' 'I spent days hiding in a swamp' The court ordered the government to give the family of local community radio journalist John Gatluak 51 cows as compensation. He was taking shelter in the hotel compound when he was killed. Two soldiers were convicted of his murder and sentenced to life. Three others were found guilty of raping aid workers, four of sexual harassment, and one of theft and armed robbery. They have been sentenced to between seven and 14 years in jail. A South Sudanese soldier is checked as he arrives for sentencing Thursday's judgment was delivered in a military courtroom packed with diplomats, aid workers and officials. One accused soldier was acquitted. Another died in detention of natural causes. The attack took place during heavy fighting in Juba between government and rebel forces. More than 70 people, including two UN peacekeepers, were killed in three days of fighting. Five foreign aid workers were raped when troops stormed the hotel compound. A lawyer representing the rape survivors, Issa Muzamil Sebit, said his clients were not ""relieved"" by the ruling. The compensation offered to them was ""very embarrassing and it is an insult to the victims"", he added. In his reaction, the defendants' lawyer, Peter Malual Deng, said he was shocked by the verdict, and would appeal against it. The military court was packed when the sentences were handed down Human rights group Amnesty International welcomed the convictions. ""After much foot dragging, today's convictions and sentences represent a first step towards ending chronic impunity in South Sudan, where both government forces and the armed opposition have committed human rights violations and crimes under international law, with complete disregard for human life,"" it said in a statement. By Tomi Oladipo, BBC Africa security correspondent South Sudan's government will use this trial to claim that it is tackling abuses carried out by soldiers. But this was a high-profile case and it is difficult to see soldiers being put on trial for atrocities committed against locals. The military top brass on both sides of the conflict seem to be struggling to rein in their troops. The UN and human rights groups have repeatedly accused them of committing war crimes. In 2015, the African Union called for a special court to be set up to try war crimes suspects. However, this has not yet happened. Conflict broke out two years after South Sudan gained independence from Sudan Meanwhile, humanitarian groups continue to complain of the security risk. About 100 aid workers, mostly locals, have been killed in the conflict. This makes it more difficult to get food and medicine to the millions of people affected by the conflict. In his evidence during the trial, British hotel manager Mike Woodward said between 50 and 100 soldiers had entered the compound, looted it and raped five women. ""One group proceeded straight to the bar and restaurant while another group  continued to the residential area,"" he was quoted as saying in court. The rampage lasted for several hours, and included beatings, torture and mock executions, Mr Woodward said. The UN ordered an investigation after aid workers accused its peacekeepers of failing to come their rescue, despite the fact that they were based near the hotel. The investigation found that there had been ""a chaotic and ineffective response to the violence"" by UN troops. The findings led to the sacking of the force commander, Kenya's Lt Gen Johnson Mogoa Kimani Ondieki. The UN has about 13,000 troops in South Sudan. This video can not be played Inside south Sudan's civil war President Salva Kiir and rebel leader Rieck Machar signed a peace deal in August. The agreement stated that Mr Machar will return to government as one of five vice-presidents. However, this has not yet happened and several previous peace deals have collapsed. The conflict started after Mr Kiir sacked Mr Machar as his deputy, and accused him of plotting a coup in 2013. Mr Machar denied the allegation, and accused Mr Kiir of being an authoritarian ruler who had invented the charges against him to avoid a leadership contest. The dispute led to troops loyal to the two men clashing in Juba, and the fighting then spread to other parts of the country. It has created one of the worst humanitarian disasters in Africa, with tens of thousands of people killed and millions forced to flee their homes.

"An energy bill price cap of Â£1,136 a year for ""typical usage"" has been proposed by the regulator, Ofgem. It says the move will mean 11 million households on default deals will save about Â£75 on average, although the amount households could save will depend on their usage and supplier. The planned cap will be confirmed in November, take effect at the end of December and stay in place until 2023. Ofgem said,externalit was a ""tough"" cap which would give a fairer deal to consumers. The plan is that when the price cap is introduced at the end of the year, gas and electricity suppliers will have to cut their prices to the level of or below the cap. The Â£1,136 a year cap is based on a typical dual fuel customer paying by direct debit and the aim is to force energy companies to scrap excess charges for people on poor value default deals. The 11 million households in England, Scotland and Wales on default tariffs should be better off after the cap is introduced. Consumers in Northern Ireland have a separate energy regulator and already have a price cap. More than half of all households in Britain are on default tariffs - normally a standard variable deal - because they have never switched or have not done so recently. Even those that have switched in the past are often automatically put on more expensive default deals when they come to end of fixed-term contract deals. A typical dual fuel customer who buys their gas and electricity from the same supplier and is on a standard variable tariff is set to save about Â£75 on average. That's assuming you keep to average usage - leave the heating on all day and you'll still see your bills get more expensive. Someone on the most expensive tariff could save more than Â£120, Ofgem has calculated. But the saving depends on which supplier you are with and whether you pay by direct debit or not. A British Gas customer, for instance, would save about Â£69, according to Ofgem figures. But someone with Scottish Power, which currently has the most expensive default tariff, would save about Â£121. Are you a typical customer? According to Ofgem's definition a typical customer uses 3,100 kWH of electricity and 12,000 kWH of gas in a year. Far from it. Stephen Murray, energy expert at MoneySuperMarket, warned consumers not to be complacent about saving money on energy. ""You might think Christmas has come early with the savings mooted in today's announcement of the price cap level, but you'd be missing the bigger picture,"" he said. ""There are more than 100 tariffs available right now which are cheaper than the proposed level of the price cap at Â£1,136. That means switching today could save you Â£250 or more, and there's no need to wait for a price cap that would actually save you on average Â£75."" Martin Lewis, founder of MoneySavingExpert, added: ""The savings [from the energy cap] are still pitiful compared to the amount people would get if they switched and went to the market's cheapest providers - yet there is a real concern the imposition of a cap will give people a false sense of security that doing nothing is fine."" The regulator was given powers by the government in July to introduce the cap, in the latest attempt to help consumers struggling with the increasing costs of heating and lighting their homes. The Domestic Gas and Electricity (Tariff Cap) Act became law on 19 July and gave Ofgem a duty and the powers to put the price cap in place. The law was needed to stop loyal customers ""being exploited"", according to the Business Secretary Greg Clark. Ofgem chief executive Dermot Nolan said: ""Once the price cap is in place, all households in Great Britain covered by the cap will be protected from being overcharged for their energy."" Peter Earl, head of energy at Compare the Market, warned that energy companies could raise the prices of their best value tariffs in order to offset the impact of the price cap. ""We are concerned that engaged energy shoppers will suffer, paying an inertia tax to subsidise households stuck on standard variable tariffs. This may be the great unintended consequence of the price cap,"" he said. MoneySavingExpert's Mr Lewis said: ""Already in the run up to the price cap we've seen prices concertina - diminishing choice and savings for those who do switch. Two years ago four of the big six firms offered fixed tariffs less than 10% more expensive than the market's cheapest. Now even the best from the big six is nearly 20% more."" This video can not be played The chief executive of Energy UK tells Today companies should improve their services Energy UK is the industry body which represent gas and electricity firms. Its chief executive Lawrence Slade warned that the cap ""will pose a significant challenge"" for the more than 70 suppliers operating in the domestic energy market. ""It is crucial that the cap ensures we have an investible energy sector where efficient and financially robust companies can trade, and innovation and engagement can continue to flourish and deliver benefits for consumers."" However, he added: ""Energy efficiency is the most effective way to help customers save money on their energy bills for the long term.""

"Roy Moore (L) says he was tricked into appearing on Sacha Baron Cohen's show Former US Senate candidate Roy Moore is suing the British comedian Sacha Baron Cohen for defamation after falling victim to a TV show prank. In a sketch for his series Who Is America?, Baron Cohen pretends to be an Israeli anti-terrorism expert demonstrating a ""paedophile detector"". When the ""device"" is waved near Mr Moore, it beeps. In last year's Senate campaign,Mr Moore was dogged by allegations of sexual misconduct, which he denies. His lawyers say the satirist falsely accused their client of being a sex offender. They are seeking $95m (Â£73m) in damages from Baron Cohen and from the Showtime and CBS networks. Sacha Baron Cohen ridicule prompts Georgia lawmaker to quit Sarah Palin 'duped' for Baron Cohen TV series Mixed reviews for Baron Cohen show Representatives for Baron Cohen have not responded to the lawsuit, filed in a federal court in Washington. A spokeswoman for Showtime said it did not comment on pending litigation. Mr Moore, 71, stood as a Republican candidate in last year's Senate race in his home state of Alabama, but lost to Democratic opponent Doug Jones. He had been expected to win in the conservative state, but his campaign was dogged by allegations of sexual misconduct with teenagers. He denies any wrongdoing. In May,Mr Moore filed a defamation lawsuit against women who made allegations against him, saying they were part of a ""political conspiracy"" to undermine his campaign. Mr Moore said he had travelled to Washington to appear on what he thought was an Israeli TV show in the belief that he was to receive an award for his pro-Israel stance. The complaint says: ""Defendant Cohen's character falsely and fraudulently introduced a false and fraudulent 'device' supposedly invented by the Israeli Army to detect paedophiles. ""During the segment, Defendant Cohen's 'device' - as part of the false and fraudulent routine - purports to detect Judge Moore as a sex offender, thus defaming him."" The complaint says Mr Moore, his wife and their whole family suffered ""severe emotional distress and pain... especially given his status as a prominent conservative and God fearing person of faith"". In the show broadcast in the US in July, when the beep sounds, Mr Moore tells Baron Cohen: ""I support Israel. I don't support this kind of stuff."" He then walks out. Mr Moore was not the first public figure duped into a fake interview in a Baron Cohen show. In July,Georgia lawmaker Jason Spencer, ridiculed for dropping his trousers and using racial slurson Who Is America?, said he would resign. The Republican state representative initially refused to quit after the show aired.

More than half of all households in Britain are on default tariffs - normally a standard variable deal - because they have never switched or have not done so recently. Even those that have switched in the past are often automatically put on more expensive default deals when they come to end of fixed-term contract deals. A typical dual fuel customer who buys their gas and electricity from the same supplier and is on a standard variable tariff is set to save about Â£75 on average. That's assuming you keep to average usage - leave the heating on all day and you'll still see your bills get more expensive. Someone on the most expensive tariff could save more than Â£120, Ofgem has calculated. But the saving depends on which supplier you are with and whether you pay by direct debit or not. A British Gas customer, for instance, would save about Â£69, according to Ofgem figures. But someone with Scottish Power, which currently has the most expensive default tariff, would save about Â£121. Are you a typical customer? According to Ofgem's definition a typical customer uses 3,100 kWH of electricity and 12,000 kWH of gas in a year. Far from it. Stephen Murray, energy expert at MoneySuperMarket, warned consumers not to be complacent about saving money on energy. ""You might think Christmas has come early with the savings mooted in today's announcement of the price cap level, but you'd be missing the bigger picture,"" he said. ""There are more than 100 tariffs available right now which are cheaper than the proposed level of the price cap at Â£1,136. That means switching today could save you Â£250 or more, and there's no need to wait for a price cap that would actually save you on average Â£75."" Martin Lewis, founder of MoneySavingExpert, added: ""The savings [from the energy cap] are still pitiful compared to the amount people would get if they switched and went to the market's cheapest providers - yet there is a real concern the imposition of a cap will give people a false sense of security that doing nothing is fine."" The regulator was given powers by the government in July to introduce the cap, in the latest attempt to help consumers struggling with the increasing costs of heating and lighting their homes. The Domestic Gas and Electricity (Tariff Cap) Act became law on 19 July and gave Ofgem a duty and the powers to put the price cap in place. The law was needed to stop loyal customers ""being exploited"", according to the Business Secretary Greg Clark. Ofgem chief executive Dermot Nolan said: ""Once the price cap is in place, all households in Great Britain covered by the cap will be protected from being overcharged for their energy."" Peter Earl, head of energy at Compare the Market, warned that energy companies could raise the prices of their best value tariffs in order to offset the impact of the price cap. ""We are concerned that engaged energy shoppers will suffer, paying an inertia tax to subsidise households stuck on standard variable tariffs. This may be the great unintended consequence of the price cap,"" he said. MoneySavingExpert's Mr Lewis said: ""Already in the run up to the price cap we've seen prices concertina - diminishing choice and savings for those who do switch. Two years ago four of the big six firms offered fixed tariffs less than 10% more expensive than the market's cheapest. Now even the best from the big six is nearly 20% more."" This video can not be played The chief executive of Energy UK tells Today companies should improve their services Energy UK is the industry body which represent gas and electricity firms. Its chief executive Lawrence Slade warned that the cap ""will pose a significant challenge"" for the more than 70 suppliers operating in the domestic energy market. ""It is crucial that the cap ensures we have an investible energy sector where efficient and financially robust companies can trade, and innovation and engagement can continue to flourish and deliver benefits for consumers."" However, he added: ""Energy efficiency is the most effective way to help customers save money on their energy bills for the long term.""

"Spacey was also replaced by another actor in the film All the Money in the World Frank Underwood is officially dead, a trailer for the sixth and final series of House of Cards has revealed. The Netflix trailer shows Robin Wright, who plays Spacey's screen wife Claire, speaking at Frank's grave. ""I'll tell you this though, Francis. When they bury me, it won't be in my backyard. When they pay their respects, they'll have to wait in line."" Spacey was dropped from the show following sexual assault allegations, which he denies. Allow YouTube content?

The trailer gave no details of how Underwood dies in the show but Netflix has said the final series will focus on Wright's devious character, who became US president at the end of season five after Spacey's character quit the Oval Office. Last year, Spacey was accused by actor Anthony Rapp of trying to seduce him in 1986 when Rapp was 14. Spacey claimed to have no memory of the events but publicly apologised. Power couple Claire and Frank Underwood ruled the White House He has since issued an ""absolute"" denial of the other allegations that later emerged. On Wednesday,it was announced that Spacey will not be prosecutedover an accusation of sexual assault that allegedly took place in 1992. The Los Angeles County District Attorney's office said the alleged incident was outside California's statute of limitations. Officials confirmed in April that an allegation involving Spacey and an incident with a man in West Hollywood in 1992 was being investigated. Another case concerning an alleged incident in 2016 remains under review. Robin Wright said: ""Every human being has the ability to reform."" Police in London are investigating six criminal cases against him. The final season of House of Cards will drop on Netflix on 2 November with eight episodes rather than the usual 13. In an interview with Net-A-Porter's digital magazine, Wright said the show came ""very, very close"" to being cancelled after its fifth season, ""because of the climate at that time"". ""The air was thick, you know. Harvey Weinstein... People were [saying], 'We have to shut everything down or otherwise it will look like we are glorifying and honouring this thing that's dirty',"" she said. Wright said the political thriller itself ""is not dirty"" and that she believed it should be finished for the ""people that loved the show"". She said it would not have been fair on all the people who worked on the show if it had been cancelled. Asked if she thinks Spacey deserves a career reprieve, she said: ""I don't know how to comment on that, I really don't... I believe every human being has the ability to reform. ""In that sense, second chances, or whatever you are going to call it - absolutely, I believe in that. It's called growth.""

"Burberry said it would expand efforts to donate or recycle unsold stock British luxury goods maker Burberryhas announced,externalthat it will stop the practice of burning unsold goods, with immediate effect. The fashion label also said it would stop using real fur in its products, and would phase out existing fur items. In July, an earnings report revealed thatBurberry destroyed unsold clothes, accessories and perfume worth Â£28.6m in 2017 to protect its brand. The news had led to an angry response from environmental campaigners. At the time, the retailer said that 2017 had been unusual as it had to destroy Â£10m worth of old perfume products after signing a new deal with US firm Coty. Fashion firms including Burberry destroy unwanted items to prevent them being stolen or sold cheaply. The fight to end fashion's silence on its waste problem Stella McCartney: Fashion is swamping our planet Global demand for old clothes declines Burberry said it already reused, repaired, donated or recycled unsold products, but it would continue to increase these efforts. Environmental campaigning group Greenpeace told the BBC: ""Burberry's decision to stop incinerating its overstock is a much-needed sign of a change of mind in the fashion industry. ""Because fashion is a high-volume business with more than 100 billion garments produced each year, consumers' closets are already overflowing with unworn clothes - creating an overstock problem for many companies. ""It's high time for the whole fashion industry to start dealing with overstock at its source: by slowing down production and re-thinking the way it does business."" Burberry has started a partnership with sustainable luxury company Elvis & Kresse in the past year that will see 120 tonnes of leather off-cuts transformed into new products over the next five years. At the same time, the fashion label has also established the Burberry Material Futures Research Group with the Royal College of Art to invent new sustainable materials. ""Modern luxury means being socially and environmentally responsible,"" said Burberry's chief executive Marco Gobbetti. ""This belief is core to us at Burberry and key to our long-term success. We are committed to applying the same creativity to all parts of Burberry as we do to our products."" The Ellen Macarthur Foundation - which aims to eradicate waste in a host of sectors -  said ina report published in 2015,externalthat nearly three quarters (73%) of the 53 million tonnes of textiles and fibres produced globally every year end up either in landfill or incinerated. Burberry currently uses rabbit, fox, mink and Asiatic racoon fur in its collections, but will stop using them in the future. The People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) foundation, which has long campaigned against the company, told the BBC it welcomed Burberry's decision. ""The few fashion houses refusing to modernise and listen to the overwhelming public opinion against fur are now sticking out like a sore thumb,"" Peta said. ""If they want to stay relevant in a changing industry, they have no choice but to stop using fur stolen from animals for their coats, collars, and cuffs."" Safia Minney, founder of sustainable clothing brand People Tree and managing director of ethical footwear brand Po-Zu, welcomed Burberry's move, but said both the industry and consumers could still to do more. ""We really need to be consuming way less. We need to be loving and treating our clothes better,"" she said. ""Fashion has become faster and faster and more and more disposable, with products actually not at all covering the true cost of their manufacture in terms of the environmental costs and human rights costs.""

"Three passengers and seven crew members were taken to hospital, Emirates said Health officials in New York are awaiting the outcome of tests after 10 passengers on an Emirates flight from Dubai were taken to hospital. Acting health commissioner Dr Oxiris Barbot said their symptoms - fever, coughing and vomiting - suggested flu. Flight 203 was quarantined at JFK airport on Wednesday after more than 100 passengers and crew complained of feeling unwell during the flight. All those on board were screened by health officials on arrival. Three passengers and seven crew members were assessed as needing care in hospital. Dr Barbot said she hoped the laboratory results from respiratory samples would be released on Thursday. Flight 203 was travelling with 521 passengers on board when a pilot reported a number were coughing and experiencing high temperatures. Rapper Vanilla Ice was on the plane and posted a video of the emergency response when the plane landed on Wednesday morning. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"One of the UK's leading female astronomers is to donate her Â£2.3m winnings from a major science prize she was awarded. The sum will go to fund women, under-represented ethnic minority and refugee students to become physics researchers. Prof Dame Jocelyn Bell Burnell has been awarded a Breakthrough Prize for the discovery of radio pulsars. This was also the subject of the physics Nobel in 1974, but her male collaborators received the award. The Breakthrough award also recognises her scientific leadership. Prof Bell Burnell believes that under-represented groups - who will benefit from the donation - will bring new ideas to the field. ""I don't want or need the money myself and it seemed to me that this was perhaps the best use I could put to it,"" she told BBC News. Prof Bell Burnell's story has been both an inspiration and motivation for many female scientists. As a research student when pulsars were discovered, she was not included in the Nobel prize citation - despite having been the first to observe and analyse the astronomical objects (a type of neutron star that emits a beam of radiation). She now says she wants to use her prize money to counter what she describes as the ""unconscious bias"" that she believes still occurs in physics research jobs. The former president of the Institute of Physics (IOP) believes that it was because she was from a minority group herself that she had the fresh ideas required to make her discovery as a young student at Cambridge University more than 50 years ago. ""I found pulsars because I was a minority person and feeling a bit overawed at Cambridge. I was both female but also from the north-west of the country and I think everybody else around me was southern English,"" she said. ""So I have this hunch that minority folk bring a fresh angle on things and that is often a very productive thing. In general, a lot of breakthroughs come from left field."" Professor Dame Julia Higgins, president of the Institute of Physics, said: ""This is an excellent and hugely appropriate acknowledgement of Jocelyn's work. Her discovery of pulsars still stands as one of the most significant discoveries in physics and inspires scientists the world over. ""Her example of using insight and tenacity to make a discovery that rings through the ages stands her alongside the greatest of scientists. ""Alongside her scientific achievement, Jocelyn has become a hugely respected leader in the scientific community. She has been instrumental in making sure the issue of access to science by people from under-represented groups is at the very top of the science community's agenda."" The fine detail of the scholarship have yet to be decided. In addition to women and under-represented ethnic minorities, refugee applicants will also be eligible for a slice of the funding. She said of these groups: ""Those are the people that tend to be discriminated against through unconscious bias so I think that's maybe one of the reasons why there aren't so many. And so if they come with some funding with them then they look much more attractive"". Prof Bell Burnell has been diplomatic when asked about the Nobel Prize controversy. But she hopes that her scheme will play a part in changing the current disparity. ""There certainly has been a notable lack of women Nobel Prize winners, except maybe in areas like literature where you know there are women,"" she said. ""I think in part that's to do with the age profile of the women that there are in the subject at the moment.

And her message to those thinking of applying for her scholarship? ""I'd say go for it if you're at all interested.

"Eight fire engines were called to the scene in Centurion Square A woman has died in a ""suspicious"" fire which ripped through a south London townhouse. Residents in Centurion Square, Woolwich, were woken by a loud bang at about 01:00 BST before flames took hold. The victim, in her late 40s, was found dead inside the three-storey property. A man in his 60s was seen jumping to safety from a second-floor window. He and a woman in her 50s both sustained non-life threatening injuries. Up to 60 firefighters tackled the blaze, which prompted more than 20 emergency calls. A Scotland Yard spokesman said the fire was ""being treated as suspicious"". A neighbour, who did not want to be named, said she heard a loud bang which she thought might have been some sort of gas explosion. ""I heard the boom so when I came out I just saw the flame and people were screaming. ""When I came there the old man was jumping from the top. He was just on the floor, it was horrible, I didn't want to watch."" The woman was found dead inside the house after the fire was brought under control It is the third fatal fire in London in a week. One woman died at the scene of a flat fire in Chalfont Road, Edmonton, on Sunday while another woman died in hospital following a flat fire in Chalk Farm, Camden, on Monday.

"The Walney wind farm cost Â£1bn to build The world's largest working offshore wind farm - covering an area equal to 20,000 football pitches - has opened off the coast of Cumbria. The Â£1bn Walney facility already had 102 turbines before the completion of a further 87 earlier this year - dubbed the Walney Extension. Each turbine stands 623ft (190m) high, with the wind farm covering an area of 55 sq miles (145 sq km). It can generate 659 megawatts - enough power for 600,000 homes. Sitting in the Irish Sea 12 miles (19km) off Barrow-in-Furness, the wind farm overtakes the current largest operational facility,  London Array, in the Thames Estuary. Danish owner Orsted began onshore construction of the project in 2015. Each turbine stands 623ft (190m) high - about twice the height of Big Ben Matthew Wright, UK managing director, said: ""The north west region plays an important role in our UK offshore wind operations and our aim is to make a lasting and positive impact here."" Energy Minister Claire Perry, said: ""Record-breaking engineering landmarks like this help us consolidate our global leadership position, break records for generating renewable energy, and create thousands of high quality jobs."" About 250 people will be employed in the operation and maintenance of the wind farm. The turbine blades were manufactured in Hull and the Isle of Wight. Orsted has pledged aCommunity Benefit Fund worth up to Â£600,000for each of the wind farm's 25-year expected lifespan. It will support community and environmental projects in coastal areas of Cumbria and Lancashire.

"One of the UK's leading female astronomers is to donate her Â£2.3m winnings from a major science prize she was awarded. The sum will go to fund women, under-represented ethnic minority and refugee students to become physics researchers. Prof Dame Jocelyn Bell Burnell has been awarded a Breakthrough Prize for the discovery of radio pulsars. This was also the subject of the physics Nobel in 1974, but her male collaborators received the award. The Breakthrough award also recognises her scientific leadership. Prof Bell Burnell believes that under-represented groups - who will benefit from the donation - will bring new ideas to the field. ""I don't want or need the money myself and it seemed to me that this was perhaps the best use I could put to it,"" she told BBC News. Prof Bell Burnell's story has been both an inspiration and motivation for many female scientists. As a research student when pulsars were discovered, she was not included in the Nobel prize citation - despite having been the first to observe and analyse the astronomical objects (a type of neutron star that emits a beam of radiation). She now says she wants to use her prize money to counter what she describes as the ""unconscious bias"" that she believes still occurs in physics research jobs. The former president of the Institute of Physics (IOP) believes that it was because she was from a minority group herself that she had the fresh ideas required to make her discovery as a young student at Cambridge University more than 50 years ago. ""I found pulsars because I was a minority person and feeling a bit overawed at Cambridge. I was both female but also from the north-west of the country and I think everybody else around me was southern English,"" she said. ""So I have this hunch that minority folk bring a fresh angle on things and that is often a very productive thing. In general, a lot of breakthroughs come from left field."" Professor Dame Julia Higgins, president of the Institute of Physics, said: ""This is an excellent and hugely appropriate acknowledgement of Jocelyn's work. Her discovery of pulsars still stands as one of the most significant discoveries in physics and inspires scientists the world over. ""Her example of using insight and tenacity to make a discovery that rings through the ages stands her alongside the greatest of scientists. ""Alongside her scientific achievement, Jocelyn has become a hugely respected leader in the scientific community. She has been instrumental in making sure the issue of access to science by people from under-represented groups is at the very top of the science community's agenda."" The fine detail of the scholarship have yet to be decided. In addition to women and under-represented ethnic minorities, refugee applicants will also be eligible for a slice of the funding. She said of these groups: ""Those are the people that tend to be discriminated against through unconscious bias so I think that's maybe one of the reasons why there aren't so many. And so if they come with some funding with them then they look much more attractive"". Prof Bell Burnell has been diplomatic when asked about the Nobel Prize controversy. But she hopes that her scheme will play a part in changing the current disparity. ""There certainly has been a notable lack of women Nobel Prize winners, except maybe in areas like literature where you know there are women,"" she said. ""I think in part that's to do with the age profile of the women that there are in the subject at the moment. Nobel Prizes rarely go to young people; they more often go to established people and it's at that level that there are fewer women in physics."" And her message to those thinking of applying for her scholarship? ""I'd say go for it if you're at all interested. I think physics is immense fun... and if you don't want to continue in it forever you're very well equipped to do all sorts of things afterwards,"" she explained.

"UK fruit and vegetable growers will be able to recruit non-EU migrants as seasonal workers after Brexit under a new pilot scheme. Ministers say the initiative between spring 2019 and December 2020 will help tackle labour shortages during peak production periods. The visas for up to 2,500 workers a year will last for six months. The National Farmers' Union had expressed fears staff shortages could hamper the harvesting of produce. Farms have been reporting a slowdown in EU labour since the referendum. Kuenssberg: What's the Brexiteers' alternative plan? EU banking on last minute Brexit deal Brexit: Key dates and potential hurdles The future of farming after Brexit The scheme, which would run during a transition period after the UK leaves the EU, was announced by the Home Office and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. Ministers stressed that the pilot will be closely monitored and could close if there is evidence migrant workers were not returning to their home countries when their visas expire. The government said that more automated harvesting solutions will be used on British farms in the future. But it said the industry needed to remain competitive, and almost all OECD countries currently use seasonal workers to pick fruit and vegetables. Environment Secretary Michael Gove said the pilot's operation will be reviewed to see how best to support the longer-term needs of the farming industry. ""We have listened to the powerful arguments from farmers about the need for seasonal labour to keep the horticulture industry productive and profitable,"" he said. Home Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""This pilot will ensure farmers have access to the seasonal labour they need to remain productive and profitable during busy times of the year."" Minette Batters, president of the National Farmers' Union, said growers will take great confidence in knowing that they will have access to workers next year after ""extremely testing and uncertain times"". She said the scheme was a ""recognition from the government that British horticulture is a successful, thriving sector which faces some unique challenges but is capable of producing more great, healthy British fruit and vegetables"". The UK's first seasonal agricultural workers scheme was introduced following labour shortages after World War Two. The most recent version covered workers from Romania and Bulgaria but ended five years ago when when restrictions on nationals of the two countries working in the UK stopped.

"Chadwick Boseman and Chris Hemsworth Chadwick Boseman took one of the main prizes at the 2018 GQ Men Of The Year Awards. The Black Panther actor took International man, while Olly Alexander from Years and Years was awarded with the live act award. The prizes recognise men and woman across sport, politics, entertainment and of course style. Dua Lipa also won best solo artist with Jorja Smith named breakthrough solo artist. Speaking after his win, Chadwick spoke about how he's dealing with the increased profile. ""Day to day, it's a different experience. You try to keep things the same and they are, you're still living, breathing, eating, loving your family and friends but it is a little bit different when you go outside."" Rose McGowan became the first woman to win the Inspiration prize, for her role in the MeToo movement, since making claims against the disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, which he denies. The actress said it had been a ""fight"" since coming forward, and that she felt ""emotionally, I was a bit more like a man"". ""The weight is very heavy,"" she said. ""It's been a fight. It's been a fight every goddamned day. Some fights, and justice, that's worth it. ""You cry a couple of tears, you pull up your bootstraps and you march on and that's what I did."" McMafia star James Norton said the Time's Up and Me Too movements have shown the need for a ""recalibration"" in gender relations. Off the back of Rose McGowan's recognition, actor James Norton said there also needs to be a conversation about how young men think about masculinity. ""There has to be a recalibration,"" he said. ""And I think people who are going to pay that cost are white men, like myself. ""You occasionally hear people who just go: 'It's not my fault, I didn't cause this, I'm a modern man, I stand for progress etc', but I think at the end of the day if it's going to happen, a cost is going to have to be paid and someone is going to pay it.""

"This is the first time soldiers have been sentenced for committing atrocities in South Sudan A military court in South Sudan has sentenced 10 soldiers to jail terms ranging from seven years to life for a rampage in which a journalist was killed and foreign aid workers raped. The court also ordered South Sudan's government to pay each rape survivor $4,000 (Â£3,000) in compensation. The crimes were committed during an attack in the Terrain Hotel in the capital Juba in 2016. A UN report accused peacekeepers of failing to respond to pleas for help. South Sudan's military and rebel forces have been accused of committing numerous atrocities since the outbreak of a civil war in 2013, but this was the worst attack against foreigners. This is the first time soldiers have been sentenced for committing atrocities in South Sudan, the world's youngest nation, which only gained independence in 2011. Africa Live: More updates on this and other stories 'Soldiers will kill you for no reason' 'I spent days hiding in a swamp' The court ordered the government to give the family of local community radio journalist John Gatluak 51 cows as compensation. He was taking shelter in the hotel compound when he was killed. Two soldiers were convicted of his murder and sentenced to life. Three others were found guilty of raping aid workers, four of sexual harassment, and one of theft and armed robbery. They have been sentenced to between seven and 14 years in jail. A South Sudanese soldier is checked as he arrives for sentencing Thursday's judgment was delivered in a military courtroom packed with diplomats, aid workers and officials. One accused soldier was acquitted. Another died in detention of natural causes. The attack took place during heavy fighting in Juba between government and rebel forces. More than 70 people, including two UN peacekeepers, were killed in three days of fighting. Five foreign aid workers were raped when troops stormed the hotel compound. A lawyer representing the rape survivors, Issa Muzamil Sebit, said his clients were not ""relieved"" by the ruling. The compensation offered to them was ""very embarrassing and it is an insult to the victims"", he added. In his reaction, the defendants' lawyer, Peter Malual Deng, said he was shocked by the verdict, and would appeal against it. The military court was packed when the sentences were handed down Human rights group Amnesty International welcomed the convictions. ""After much foot dragging, today's convictions and sentences represent a first step towards ending chronic impunity in South Sudan, where both government forces and the armed opposition have committed human rights violations and crimes under international law, with complete disregard for human life,"" it said in a statement. By Tomi Oladipo, BBC Africa security correspondent South Sudan's government will use this trial to claim that it is tackling abuses carried out by soldiers. But this was a high-profile case and it is difficult to see soldiers being put on trial for atrocities committed against locals. The military top brass on both sides of the conflict seem to be struggling to rein in their troops. The UN and human rights groups have repeatedly accused them of committing war crimes. In 2015, the African Union called for a special court to be set up to try war crimes suspects. However, this has not yet happened. Conflict broke out two years after South Sudan gained independence from Sudan Meanwhile, humanitarian groups continue to complain of the security risk. About 100 aid workers, mostly locals, have been killed in the conflict. This makes it more difficult to get food and medicine to the millions of people affected by the conflict. In his evidence during the trial, British hotel manager Mike Woodward said between 50 and 100 soldiers had entered the compound, looted it and raped five women. ""One group proceeded straight to the bar and restaurant while another group  continued to the residential area,"" he was quoted as saying in court. The rampage lasted for several hours, and included beatings, torture and mock executions, Mr Woodward said. The UN ordered an investigation after aid workers accused its peacekeepers of failing to come their rescue, despite the fact that they were based near the hotel. The investigation found that there had been ""a chaotic and ineffective response to the violence"" by UN troops. The findings led to the sacking of the force commander, Kenya's Lt Gen Johnson Mogoa Kimani Ondieki. The UN has about 13,000 troops in South Sudan. This video can not be played Inside south Sudan's civil war President Salva Kiir and rebel leader Rieck Machar signed a peace deal in August. The agreement stated that Mr Machar will return to government as one of five vice-presidents. However, this has not yet happened and several previous peace deals have collapsed. The conflict started after Mr Kiir sacked Mr Machar as his deputy, and accused him of plotting a coup in 2013. Mr Machar denied the allegation, and accused Mr Kiir of being an authoritarian ruler who had invented the charges against him to avoid a leadership contest. The dispute led to troops loyal to the two men clashing in Juba, and the fighting then spread to other parts of the country. It has created one of the worst humanitarian disasters in Africa, with tens of thousands of people killed and millions forced to flee their homes.

"The risk of exposure is ""low"", according to the HSE The Health and Safety Executive (HSENI) is trying to establish whether pupils in Northern Ireland have been affected by asbestos in science classrooms. Its action comes after the HSE in England warned that some metal gauze mats used with Bunsen burners contained asbestos. The risk of exposure is ""low"", according to the HSE. It has told two UK companies to stop supplying the affected gauze mats to schools. But the NASUWT teaching union has written to the Department of Education (DE) to make the names of the two suppliers public. In a letter to the DE permanent secretary Derek Baker, the NASUWT's general secretary Chris Keates said the HSE's announcement would cause ""deep concern."" As well as calling for the names of the two firms to be revealed, she called for more advice to be issued to schools. ""The NASUWT believes that it is essential the government investigates why it has taken so long for it to be identified that these suppliers are using hazardous materials,"" she wrote. ""Thousands of pupils and school staff could have been exposed to this."" In response a DE spokesperson said the department is ""working with the Education Authority and the Health and Safety Executive NI to establish the position in Northern Ireland."" A spokesperson for Education Authority said: ""The Education Authority is aware of ongoing investigations by Health & Safety Executive GB and Health & Safety Executive NI around metal gauze mats containing asbestos."" ""We continue to work with HSENI in establishing any issues affecting Northern Ireland as part of the UK-wide review and we will keep schools updated.""

""Mercedes were very helpful in the end, they sent me an email on Monday saying not to worry and the money was back in the account. ""They said they were more than willing to pay us for the extra charges we incurred as well. ""I think we were the only people to spend that much on that day, it was bad luck.""

"Eight fire engines were called to the scene in Centurion Square A woman has died in a ""suspicious"" fire which ripped through a south London townhouse. Residents in Centurion Square, Woolwich, were woken by a loud bang at about 01:00 BST before flames took hold. The victim, in her late 40s, was found dead inside the three-storey property. A man in his 60s was seen jumping to safety from a second-floor window. He and a woman in her 50s both sustained non-life threatening injuries. Up to 60 firefighters tackled the blaze, which prompted more than 20 emergency calls. A Scotland Yard spokesman said the fire was ""being treated as suspicious"". A neighbour, who did not want to be named, said she heard a loud bang which she thought might have been some sort of gas explosion. ""I heard the boom so when I came out I just saw the flame and people were screaming. ""When I came there the old man was jumping from the top. He was just on the floor, it was horrible, I didn't want to watch."" The woman was found dead inside the house after the fire was brought under control It is the third fatal fire in London in a week. One woman died at the scene of a flat fire in Chalfont Road, Edmonton, on Sunday while another woman died in hospital following a flat fire in Chalk Farm, Camden, on Monday. An investigation has begun into the cause of the Woolwich blaze, which was brought under control by 03:15, LFB said. ""Sadly one woman was found dead at the scene by crews wearing breathing apparatus,"" the brigade added.

"This video can not be played ""I'm finally glad I can say I'm not a criminal in this country anymore"" In a historic decision, India's Supreme Court has ruled that gay sex is no longer a criminal offence. The ruling overturns a 2013 judgement that upheld a colonial-era law, known as section 377, under which gay sex is categorised as an ""unnatural offence"". The court has now ruled discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is a fundamental violation of rights. Campaigners outside the court cheered and some broke down in tears as the ruling was handed down. Although public opinion in India's biggest cities has been in favour of scrapping the law, there remains strong opposition among religious groups and in conservative rural communities. Joy in India as gay sex legalised The privacy case that paved the way How previous ruling shocked the gay community Where is gay sex still against the law? But this ruling, from the top court, is the final say in the matter and represents a huge victory for India's LGBT community. One activist outside the court told the BBC: ""I hadn't come out to my parents until now. But today, I guess I have."" Thursday's decision was delivered by a five-judge bench headed by India's outgoing chief justice Dipak Misra and was unanimous. Reading out the judgement, he said: ""Criminalising carnal intercourse is irrational, arbitrary and manifestly unconstitutional."" Another judge, Indu Malhotra, said she believed ""history owes an apology"" to LGBT people for ostracising them. Justice DY Chandrachud said the state had no right to control the private lives of LGBT community members and that the denial of the right to sexual orientation was the same as denying the right to privacy. The ruling effectively allows gay sex among consenting adults in private. It is a 157-year-old colonial-era law which criminalises certain sexual acts as ""unnatural offences"" that are punishable by a 10-year jail term. A joyful reaction to the ruling at an NGO in Mumbai The law punishes, in its own words, ""carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man, woman or animal"". While the statute criminalises all anal and oral sex, it has largely affected same-sex relationships. Human rights groups say police have used the statute to harass and abuse members of the LGBT community. Geeta Pandey, BBC News, Delhi Even though it was rarely invoked when it involved consenting adults, section 377 could be - and was sometimes - used as a tool for harassment. It is not surprising then that campaigners are describing the verdict as a ""new dawn for personal liberty"". But in a largely conservative India, where leaders of all religions have consistently opposed gay sex, it will still be a while before attitudes change and the community finds full acceptance. But laws almost always play an important role in changing mindsets, and by recognising the community's right to love, the Supreme Court has restored the dignity denied to them for a very long time. It's been a tortuous route. A bid to repeal section 377 was initiated in 2001 and was batted between court and government until 2009, when the Delhi High Court ruled in favour of decriminalisation.

"Captain Nikesh Rastogi said he was ready to breathe a huge sigh of relief at the prospect of going back home to India An Indian-registered ship impounded in an English port for more than two years is finally on the verge of being sold. The Malaviya Twenty has been stuck in Great Yarmouth in Norfolk since June 2016 due to legal wrangles and is now being sold by the Admiralty Marshal. Bids for the ship will open on Tuesday, with the proceeds going to pay debts including crew wages and port fees. Captain Nikesh Rastogi said he would breathe a ""huge sigh of relief"" at the prospect of going home to Mumbai. Captain Nikesh Rastogi said he and his crewmates had not been paid since the end of last year Capt Rastogi joined the already-marooned boat 18 months ago but has not been paid since late last year, along with his three crew members. They have been stuck aboard the boat, a supply vessel, in the town's port in the meantime. The Malaviya Twenty - estimated to be worth between Â£700,000 and Â£800,000 - was ""arrested"" by the Admiralty Marshalwhen the crew's lawyers secured a High Court order last month. The boat's owners went into liquidation in January. Capt Rastogi said the ""worst was over"" after being stuck on the boat for 18 months ""There has to be a certain amount of resilience and fortitude,"" said Capt Rastogi. ""We hope there's a suitable quote by the 11th when the tenders open and on the 12th we could be enjoying in-flight meals. ""It would be a huge sigh of relief. The worst is over... the Marshal has been kind enough to arrest the vessel. ""Once you leave this location... it will hit you that you are finally free."" Stranded sailor can finally return home Sailor stranded on ship for 15 months End in sight for stranded sailors Capt Rastogi joked he had been away from India for so long he would have to read up on what his home country was like. He said he and the crew had stayed on the boat as they feared it could be deemed a derelict and taken over, meaning they would go unpaid. The Malaviya Twenty ship was impounded in Great Yarmouth in June 2016 after bills went unpaid The International Transport Workers' Federation (ITF) has said 33 crew members had been on and off the vessel since October 2015 and not received wages. The vessel, serving the town's oil and gas industry, was originally detained after theMaritime and Coastguard Agency found the crew and port had not been paid. Jim Buck, from Great Yarmouth harbour owner Peel Ports, said the crew would be be paid ahead of the port because the Marshal had seized the vessel on their behalf. ""It should work through quite quickly and then the crew can go home as they deserve to do and get the pay they deserve too,"" he said. ""There should be more than enough money to pay everybody."" Its sister boat, Malaviya Seven,was sold last year after being stranded with a crew for more than a yearin Scotland.

"Ed Sheeran had the biggest-selling album of 2017 Ed Sheeran, Sam Smith and Dua Lipa helped the British record industry earn Â£408m overseas last year, the highest figure on record. Export revenues from recorded music grew by 12% compared with 2016, fuelled by ""phenomenal global demand"" for Ed Sheeran's Divide, said the BPI. The record sold 6.1 million copies last year, beating releases by Drake, Kendrick Lamar and Taylor Swift. But the BPI warned a ""bad Brexit deal"" could harm British music's profits. ""With Brexit approaching, music can help to showcase what is exciting about the UK as we forge new trading relationships,"" said chief executive Geoff Taylor. ""But only if our government supports us by ensuring a strong Brexit deal that enables artists to tour freely, robustly protects music rights, and prevents physical music products being impeded in transit."" The BPI said the value of British music exports - sales of CDs, vinyl, streaming and downloads of singles and albums - has brought in more than Â£5bn since it started tracking revenues in 2000. Europe is currently the record industry's biggest overseas market, generating Â£165m in revenues last year. It is closely followed by the US, which accounts for 35% of the UK's music earnings - but the industry is also seeing rapid growth in new markets including China, India and Brazil. In total, UK artists accounted for one in every eight albums consumed globally in 2017, the BPI said, with British artists creating four of the year's top 10 best-sellers. Once overseas payments were taken into account, the industry contributed Â£200m to the UK economy last year. According to UK Music, the industry's total export revenues are roughly Â£2.5bn, with live music, publishing and royalties also contributing to the coffers.

"An energy bill price cap of Â£1,136 a year for ""typical usage"" has been proposed by the regulator, Ofgem. It says the move will mean 11 million households on default deals will save about Â£75 on average, although the amount households could save will depend on their usage and supplier. The planned cap will be confirmed in November, take effect at the end of December and stay in place until 2023. Ofgem said,externalit was a ""tough"" cap which would give a fairer deal to consumers. The plan is that when the price cap is introduced at the end of the year, gas and electricity suppliers will have to cut their prices to the level of or below the cap. The Â£1,136 a year cap is based on a typical dual fuel customer paying by direct debit and the aim is to force energy companies to scrap excess charges for people on poor value default deals. The 11 million households in England, Scotland and Wales on default tariffs should be better off after the cap is introduced. Consumers in Northern Ireland have a separate energy regulator and already have a price cap. More than half of all households in Britain are on default tariffs - normally a standard variable deal - because they have never switched or have not done so recently. Even those that have switched in the past are often automatically put on more expensive default deals when they come to end of fixed-term contract deals. A typical dual fuel customer who buys their gas and electricity from the same supplier and is on a standard variable tariff is set to save about Â£75 on average. That's assuming you keep to average usage - leave the heating on all day and you'll still see your bills get more expensive. Someone on the most expensive tariff could save more than Â£120, Ofgem has calculated. But the saving depends on which supplier you are with and whether you pay by direct debit or not. A British Gas customer, for instance, would save about Â£69, according to Ofgem figures. But someone with Scottish Power, which currently has the most expensive default tariff, would save about Â£121. Are you a typical customer? According to Ofgem's definition a typical customer uses 3,100 kWH of electricity and 12,000 kWH of gas in a year. Far from it. Stephen Murray, energy expert at MoneySuperMarket, warned consumers not to be complacent about saving money on energy. ""You might think Christmas has come early with the savings mooted in today's announcement of the price cap level, but you'd be missing the bigger picture,"" he said. ""There are more than 100 tariffs available right now which are cheaper than the proposed level of the price cap at Â£1,136. That means switching today could save you Â£250 or more, and there's no need to wait for a price cap that would actually save you on average Â£75."" Martin Lewis, founder of MoneySavingExpert, added: ""The savings [from the energy cap] are still pitiful compared to the amount people would get if they switched and went to the market's cheapest providers - yet there is a real concern the imposition of a cap will give people a false sense of security that doing nothing is fine."" The regulator was given powers by the government in July to introduce the cap, in the latest attempt to help consumers struggling with the increasing costs of heating and lighting their homes. The Domestic Gas and Electricity (Tariff Cap) Act became law on 19 July and gave Ofgem a duty and the powers to put the price cap in place. The law was needed to stop loyal customers ""being exploited"", according to the Business Secretary Greg Clark.

"An energy bill price cap of Â£1,136 a year for ""typical usage"" has been proposed by the regulator, Ofgem. It says the move will mean 11 million households on default deals will save about Â£75 on average, although the amount households could save will depend on their usage and supplier. The planned cap will be confirmed in November, take effect at the end of December and stay in place until 2023. Ofgem said,externalit was a ""tough"" cap which would give a fairer deal to consumers. The plan is that when the price cap is introduced at the end of the year, gas and electricity suppliers will have to cut their prices to the level of or below the cap. The Â£1,136 a year cap is based on a typical dual fuel customer paying by direct debit and the aim is to force energy companies to scrap excess charges for people on poor value default deals. The 11 million households in England, Scotland and Wales on default tariffs should be better off after the cap is introduced. Consumers in Northern Ireland have a separate energy regulator and already have a price cap. More than half of all households in Britain are on default tariffs - normally a standard variable deal - because they have never switched or have not done so recently. Even those that have switched in the past are often automatically put on more expensive default deals when they come to end of fixed-term contract deals. A typical dual fuel customer who buys their gas and electricity from the same supplier and is on a standard variable tariff is set to save about Â£75 on average. That's assuming you keep to average usage - leave the heating on all day and you'll still see your bills get more expensive. Someone on the most expensive tariff could save more than Â£120, Ofgem has calculated. But the saving depends on which supplier you are with and whether you pay by direct debit or not. A British Gas customer, for instance, would save about Â£69, according to Ofgem figures. But someone with Scottish Power, which currently has the most expensive default tariff, would save about Â£121. Are you a typical customer? According to Ofgem's definition a typical customer uses 3,100 kWH of electricity and 12,000 kWH of gas in a year. Far from it. Stephen Murray, energy expert at MoneySuperMarket, warned consumers not to be complacent about saving money on energy. ""You might think Christmas has come early with the savings mooted in today's announcement of the price cap level, but you'd be missing the bigger picture,"" he said. ""There are more than 100 tariffs available right now which are cheaper than the proposed level of the price cap at Â£1,136. That means switching today could save you Â£250 or more, and there's no need to wait for a price cap that would actually save you on average Â£75."" Martin Lewis, founder of MoneySavingExpert, added: ""The savings [from the energy cap] are still pitiful compared to the amount people would get if they switched and went to the market's cheapest providers - yet there is a real concern the imposition of a cap will give people a false sense of security that doing nothing is fine."" The regulator was given powers by the government in July to introduce the cap, in the latest attempt to help consumers struggling with the increasing costs of heating and lighting their homes. The Domestic Gas and Electricity (Tariff Cap) Act became law on 19 July and gave Ofgem a duty and the powers to put the price cap in place. The law was needed to stop loyal customers ""being exploited"", according to the Business Secretary Greg Clark. Ofgem chief executive Dermot Nolan said: ""Once the price cap is in place, all households in Great Britain covered by the cap will be protected from being overcharged for their energy."" Peter Earl, head of energy at Compare the Market, warned that energy companies could raise the prices of their best value tariffs in order to offset the impact of the price cap.

"The Walney wind farm cost Â£1bn to build The world's largest working offshore wind farm - covering an area equal to 20,000 football pitches - has opened off the coast of Cumbria. The Â£1bn Walney facility already had 102 turbines before the completion of a further 87 earlier this year - dubbed the Walney Extension. Each turbine stands 623ft (190m) high, with the wind farm covering an area of 55 sq miles (145 sq km). It can generate 659 megawatts - enough power for 600,000 homes. Sitting in the Irish Sea 12 miles (19km) off Barrow-in-Furness, the wind farm overtakes the current largest operational facility,  London Array, in the Thames Estuary. Danish owner Orsted began onshore construction of the project in 2015. Each turbine stands 623ft (190m) high - about twice the height of Big Ben Matthew Wright, UK managing director, said: ""The north west region plays an important role in our UK offshore wind operations and our aim is to make a lasting and positive impact here."" Energy Minister Claire Perry, said: ""Record-breaking engineering landmarks like this help us consolidate our global leadership position, break records for generating renewable energy, and create thousands of high quality jobs."" About 250 people will be employed in the operation and maintenance of the wind farm. The turbine blades were manufactured in Hull and the Isle of Wight. Orsted has pledged aCommunity Benefit Fund worth up to Â£600,000for each of the wind farm's 25-year expected lifespan. It will support community and environmental projects in coastal areas of Cumbria and Lancashire.

"Distress over problem debts can lead to mental health problems Weaknesses in the government's strategy for managing personal debt is raising costs to the taxpayer, according to the National Audit Office. Struggling to pay debts makes people more likely to end up in state-subsidised housing, the body says. It also leads to anxiety and depression, which adds to NHS costs. But the government has a ""limited"" understanding of the impact of debt, and there was a lack of co-ordination between departments, the NAO said. ""Problem debt has significant consequences both for individuals and the taxpayer,"" said Amyas Morse, the head of the NAO. The government's attempts to address the issue so far had been ""insufficient"", he added. Funding pressures might also be leading to debts being pursued ""too quickly and aggressively"" the NAO said, thus exacerbating their impact. How much debt do UK households have? The NAO said its modelling estimates suggested that ""intimidating actions and additional charges"" for those in debt increased the likelihood of mental health problems. There are 8.3 million people struggling with personal debt in the UK, it said. Problem debts to government, largely over council tax or benefits, have become the biggest issue reported to Citizens Advice in the last five years. The NAO estimates the cost of problem debts to the taxpayer as follows: Increased use of social housing - Â£225m Increased use of NHS services - Â£24m But it adds that the wider costs to the economy of problem debts, such as increased dependency on a wide range of public services, informal care, and lost employment, run to Â£900m. Frank Field MP, chairman of the Work and Pensions Select Committee, said the level of private debt owed to government was ""a sorry indictment of the benefits policy"". Lower earning families are being locked ""into a miserable cycle of debt and hunger, easy prey to loan sharks and forced to resort to food banks"", he added. An HM Treasury Spokesperson said it was taking action on problem debt: ""We're increasing funding for the Money Advice Service to over Â£56m enough to help over 530,000 people get the debt advice they need. ""We're also introducing a breathing space from problem debt to give people time to get their lives back on track."" HM Treasury has formal responsibility for managing these debts, but the NAO says it has limited information, does not fully understand the problem, and cannot respond effectively. Amyas Morse, the head of the NAO, said: ""The Treasury needs a better understanding of the scale of people's debt problems and how it is impacting their lives and the taxpayer so it can effectively resolve the problem."" Joanna Elson OBE, chief executive of the Money Advice Trust, the charity that runs National Debtline, said: ""We need to see a new cross-government strategy to tackle problem debt - which brings together the work of government departments, agencies and regulators into a single, coherent approach. The NAO says the way government bodies try to collect debts can end up being counter-productive. It said its analysis had found that ""intimidating actions and additional charges"" were 15% to 29% ""more likely to make debts harder to manage and increase levels of anxiety or depression."" ""We found examples of good practice, but it is not adopted consistently. ""For example, established best practice in how to assess the affordability of repayments, promoted by The Money Advice Service, is used by only 19% of local authorities and is not used as standard by government departments,"" it added. Research by the debt charity StepChange,externalfound that more people felt they were treated unfairly by local authorities than by payday lenders. Treating debtors fairly, it estimated, could lead to creditors saving an average of Â£730 per person. StepChange CEO Phil Andrew said: ""The National Audit Office hits the nail on the head. ""Poor debt collection practices that fixate only on getting as much money back as quickly as possible are counter-productive and ultimately harmful. ""The government is simply robbing Peter to pay Paul, as the wider implications of government debt collection practices are costing taxpayers almost a quarter of a billion pounds every year.""

"A nurse and a staff sister on the terrace at Wrest Park in Silsoe A rare collection of photos of ""forgotten"" World War One nurses have been transformed into colour in an effort to trace their identities. They were taken at Wrest Park in Silsoe, Bedfordshire, which is thought to have been the first wartime country house hospital. English Heritage, which now owns the building, said the women were the ""backbone"" of the military hospital and ""deserve to be known as individuals"". It ran as a hospital from 1914 to 1916. A fire forced it to close on 14 September 1916. A group of soldiers and nurses on the terrace at Wrest Park in 1915 A nurse with one of the hospital patients dressed up as a nurse As no formal records exist of the hundreds of nurses who worked and volunteered there, the pictures have been colourised by Marina Amaral and historian Dan Jones. Andrew Hann, English Heritage lead properties historian, said: ""These women were the backbone of the hospital, and indeed the war effort, providing much needed treatment to the wounded, but also acting as a comfort to those soldiers traumatised by the horrors of war. ""They worked tirelessly and deserve to be known as individuals, just as the soldiers they cared for do."" Wrest Park Hospitalâs operating theatre was housed in the first floor bedroom Mr Hann said volunteer historians have been working to piece together information about the staff, but have now ""hit a brick wall"". ""It would be wonderful if the public could help us identify these forgotten women,"" he added.

""These women did remarkable jobs during the First World War and if my coloured images help people recognise their family members then that would be an amazing outcome.""

"Captain Nikesh Rastogi said he was ready to breathe a huge sigh of relief at the prospect of going back home to India An Indian-registered ship impounded in an English port for more than two years is finally on the verge of being sold. The Malaviya Twenty has been stuck in Great Yarmouth in Norfolk since June 2016 due to legal wrangles and is now being sold by the Admiralty Marshal. Bids for the ship will open on Tuesday, with the proceeds going to pay debts including crew wages and port fees. Captain Nikesh Rastogi said he would breathe a ""huge sigh of relief"" at the prospect of going home to Mumbai. Captain Nikesh Rastogi said he and his crewmates had not been paid since the end of last year Capt Rastogi joined the already-marooned boat 18 months ago but has not been paid since late last year, along with his three crew members. They have been stuck aboard the boat, a supply vessel, in the town's port in the meantime. The Malaviya Twenty - estimated to be worth between Â£700,000 and Â£800,000 - was ""arrested"" by the Admiralty Marshalwhen the crew's lawyers secured a High Court order last month. The boat's owners went into liquidation in January. Capt Rastogi said the ""worst was over"" after being stuck on the boat for 18 months ""There has to be a certain amount of resilience and fortitude,"" said Capt Rastogi. ""We hope there's a suitable quote by the 11th when the tenders open and on the 12th we could be enjoying in-flight meals. ""It would be a huge sigh of relief. The worst is over... the Marshal has been kind enough to arrest the vessel. ""Once you leave this location... it will hit you that you are finally free."" Stranded sailor can finally return home Sailor stranded on ship for 15 months End in sight for stranded sailors Capt Rastogi joked he had been away from India for so long he would have to read up on what his home country was like. He said he and the crew had stayed on the boat as they feared it could be deemed a derelict and taken over, meaning they would go unpaid. The Malaviya Twenty ship was impounded in Great Yarmouth in June 2016 after bills went unpaid The International Transport Workers' Federation (ITF) has said 33 crew members had been on and off the vessel since October 2015 and not received wages. The vessel, serving the town's oil and gas industry, was originally detained after theMaritime and Coastguard Agency found the crew and port had not been paid. Jim Buck, from Great Yarmouth harbour owner Peel Ports, said the crew would be be paid ahead of the port because the Marshal had seized the vessel on their behalf. ""It should work through quite quickly and then the crew can go home as they deserve to do and get the pay they deserve too,"" he said. ""There should be more than enough money to pay everybody.""

"Mum-of-two Kate Hitchens was forced to stand up and breastfeed on a train after no-one offered her a seat A mother says she was forced to stand while breastfeeding her son on a train because no-one offered her a seat. Kate Hitchens, 32, was travelling home to Wickford from London during the rush hour on Tuesday. Commuters saw she was nursing six-month-old Charlie but failed to offer assistance until the very end of her 35-minute journey, she said. The blogger, who is also mum to three-year-old Oliver, urged people to ""be kinder"" if they saw others struggling. In angry posts on Facebook and Instagram, Mrs Hitchens said she could have asked for a seat, but ""shouldn't have to"". She wrote: ""What has the world come to that a mother has to stand up on a moving train breastfeeding a wriggling and writhing six-month-old, 20lb baby? ""The point here isn't just that I found it difficult because I was nursing, but that not one person offered a mother carrying a small child a seat for three stops. I shouldn't have to ask."" Mrs Hitchens with her sons Oliver, three, and six-month-old Charlie Mrs Hitchens, who writes about baby-led weaning on her blog, Hitchen's Kitchen, said the journey on the packed commuter train left her feeling ""embarrassed and flustered"". ""I had planned to be home for dinner time but the train I wanted to get was cancelled,"" she said. ""I don't make a big deal of breastfeeding and try to be discreet but everyone could see what I was doing. ""Physically, I felt quite uncomfortable as I didn't have much to hold on to and Charlie was jiggling around as the train moved so it hurt. ""When a lovely lady did get up to offer me her seat, another sat in it, put her headphones in and closed her eyes."" She added: ""This isn't about breast v bottle-feeding - it's about being kind and showing common courtesy.

Amyas Morse, the head of the NAO, said: ""The Treasury needs a better understanding of the scale of people's debt problems and how it is impacting their lives and the taxpayer so it can effectively resolve the problem."" Joanna Elson OBE, chief executive of the Money Advice Trust, the charity that runs National Debtline, said: ""We need to see a new cross-government strategy to tackle problem debt - which brings together the work of government departments, agencies and regulators into a single, coherent approach. The NAO says the way government bodies try to collect debts can end up being counter-productive. It said its analysis had found that ""intimidating actions and additional charges"" were 15% to 29% ""more likely to make debts harder to manage and increase levels of anxiety or depression."" ""We found examples of good practice, but it is not adopted consistently. ""For example, established best practice in how to assess the affordability of repayments, promoted by The Money Advice Service, is used by only 19% of local authorities and is not used as standard by government departments,"" it added. Research by the debt charity StepChange,externalfound that more people felt they were treated unfairly by local authorities than by payday lenders. Treating debtors fairly, it estimated, could lead to creditors saving an average of Â£730 per person. StepChange CEO Phil Andrew said: ""The National Audit Office hits the nail on the head. ""Poor debt collection practices that fixate only on getting as much money back as quickly as possible are counter-productive and ultimately harmful. ""The government is simply robbing Peter to pay Paul, as the wider implications of government debt collection practices are costing taxpayers almost a quarter of a billion pounds every year.""

"Mum-of-two Kate Hitchens was forced to stand up and breastfeed on a train after no-one offered her a seat A mother says she was forced to stand while breastfeeding her son on a train because no-one offered her a seat. Kate Hitchens, 32, was travelling home to Wickford from London during the rush hour on Tuesday. Commuters saw she was nursing six-month-old Charlie but failed to offer assistance until the very end of her 35-minute journey, she said. The blogger, who is also mum to three-year-old Oliver, urged people to ""be kinder"" if they saw others struggling. In angry posts on Facebook and Instagram, Mrs Hitchens said she could have asked for a seat, but ""shouldn't have to"". She wrote: ""What has the world come to that a mother has to stand up on a moving train breastfeeding a wriggling and writhing six-month-old, 20lb baby? ""The point here isn't just that I found it difficult because I was nursing, but that not one person offered a mother carrying a small child a seat for three stops. I shouldn't have to ask."" Mrs Hitchens with her sons Oliver, three, and six-month-old Charlie Mrs Hitchens, who writes about baby-led weaning on her blog, Hitchen's Kitchen, said the journey on the packed commuter train left her feeling ""embarrassed and flustered"". ""I had planned to be home for dinner time but the train I wanted to get was cancelled,"" she said. ""I don't make a big deal of breastfeeding and try to be discreet but everyone could see what I was doing. ""Physically, I felt quite uncomfortable as I didn't have much to hold on to and Charlie was jiggling around as the train moved so it hurt. ""When a lovely lady did get up to offer me her seat, another sat in it, put her headphones in and closed her eyes."" She added: ""This isn't about breast v bottle-feeding - it's about being kind and showing common courtesy. ""If I saw someone struggling, whether it was with a baby, some heavy bags or a pile of books, I would give them my seat."" Why breastfeed a child until the age of five?

"One of the UK's leading female astronomers is to donate her Â£2.3m winnings from a major science prize she was awarded. The sum will go to fund women, under-represented ethnic minority and refugee students to become physics researchers. Prof Dame Jocelyn Bell Burnell has been awarded a Breakthrough Prize for the discovery of radio pulsars. This was also the subject of the physics Nobel in 1974, but her male collaborators received the award. The Breakthrough award also recognises her scientific leadership. Prof Bell Burnell believes that under-represented groups - who will benefit from the donation - will bring new ideas to the field. ""I don't want or need the money myself and it seemed to me that this was perhaps the best use I could put to it,"" she told BBC News. Prof Bell Burnell's story has been both an inspiration and motivation for many female scientists. As a research student when pulsars were discovered, she was not included in the Nobel prize citation - despite having been the first to observe and analyse the astronomical objects (a type of neutron star that emits a beam of radiation). She now says she wants to use her prize money to counter what she describes as the ""unconscious bias"" that she believes still occurs in physics research jobs. The former president of the Institute of Physics (IOP) believes that it was because she was from a minority group herself that she had the fresh ideas required to make her discovery as a young student at Cambridge University more than 50 years ago. ""I found pulsars because I was a minority person and feeling a bit overawed at Cambridge. I was both female but also from the north-west of the country and I think everybody else around me was southern English,"" she said. ""So I have this hunch that minority folk bring a fresh angle on things and that is often a very productive thing. In general, a lot of breakthroughs come from left field."" Professor Dame Julia Higgins, president of the Institute of Physics, said: ""This is an excellent and hugely appropriate acknowledgement of Jocelyn's work. Her discovery of pulsars still stands as one of the most significant discoveries in physics and inspires scientists the world over. ""Her example of using insight and tenacity to make a discovery that rings through the ages stands her alongside the greatest of scientists. ""Alongside her scientific achievement, Jocelyn has become a hugely respected leader in the scientific community. She has been instrumental in making sure the issue of access to science by people from under-represented groups is at the very top of the science community's agenda."" The fine detail of the scholarship have yet to be decided. In addition to women and under-represented ethnic minorities, refugee applicants will also be eligible for a slice of the funding. She said of these groups: ""Those are the people that tend to be discriminated against through unconscious bias so I think that's maybe one of the reasons why there aren't so many. And so if they come with some funding with them then they look much more attractive"". Prof Bell Burnell has been diplomatic when asked about the Nobel Prize controversy. But she hopes that her scheme will play a part in changing the current disparity. ""There certainly has been a notable lack of women Nobel Prize winners, except maybe in areas like literature where you know there are women,"" she said. ""I think in part that's to do with the age profile of the women that there are in the subject at the moment. Nobel Prizes rarely go to young people; they more often go to established people and it's at that level that there are fewer women in physics."" And her message to those thinking of applying for her scholarship? ""I'd say go for it if you're at all interested. I think physics is immense fun... and if you don't want to continue in it forever you're very well equipped to do all sorts of things afterwards,"" she explained.

"Gwyneth Paltrow has been accused of using pseudoscience to sell products on her lifestyle website Goop The lifestyle website founded by actress Gwyneth Paltrow has agreed to pay $145,000 (Â£112,000) for making unscientific claims about vaginal eggs. The settlement also applies to a ""flower essence"", which Goop said could cure depression. Goop claimed its jade and rose quartz eggs, which are inserted vaginally, could balance hormones and regulate menstrual cycles, among other things. The lawsuit was brought by California's consumer protection office. ""The health and money of Santa Clara County residents should never be put at risk by misleading advertising,"" District Attorney Jeff Rosen said in a written statement. ""We will vigilantly protect consumers against companies that promise health benefits without the support of good scienceâ¦or any science."" The scientists calling Tom Brady and Gwyneth Paltrow's bluff Goop said in a statement that while it ""believes there is an honest disagreement about these claims, the company wanted to settle this matter quickly and amicably. This settlement does not indicate any liability on Goop's part"". Both the jade and rose quartz eggs, which are sold for $66 and $55 respectively, are still for sale, but Goop is prohibited from making further health claims that are not backed up by science. Goop also will be banned from selling medical devices that are falsely advertised or unapproved. The company agreed to pay $145,000 in civil penalties, and is also offering a refund for customers who purchased the eggs or the flower essence under false claims. It said it has not received any complaints about the product claims. Paltrow has increasingly come under scrutiny from scientists and doctors who say the actress uses pseudoscience to sell products on her website Goop.

"This video can not be played Police are appealing for information on Alexander Petrov (left) and Ruslan Boshirov Two Russian nationals have been named as suspects in the attempted murder of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia. The men, using the names Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, are thought to be officers from Russia's military intelligence service, the PM said. Scotland Yard and the CPS say there is enough evidence to charge the men. Mr Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, werepoisoned with the nerve agent Novichokin March. Det Sgt Nick Bailey also fell ill after responding to the incident in Salisbury. Police are linking the attack to a separate Novichok poisoning on 30 June, when Dawn Sturgess and Charlie Rowley became unwell at a house in Amesbury, about eight miles from Salisbury. Ms Sturgess died in hospital on 8 July. Mr Rowley was discharged from hospital on 20 July. Speaking to ITV News on Wednesday, he said he wanted to see the suspects ""brought to justice"". Salisbury poisoning suspects: Latest updates What happened to the Skripals? Why Novichok stays deadly for so long Speaking in the Commons, Prime Minister Theresa May said the government had concluded, from intelligence provided by UK agencies, that the men were part of the GRU intelligence service. The poisoning was ""not a rogue operation"" and was ""almost certainly"" approved at a senior level of the Russian state, she said. The two suspects, believed to have been using aliases, travelled on Russian passports and are thought to be aged about 40. The BBC's security correspondent Gordon Corera said he understood the authorities identified the pair ""a while back"" and ""may also know their real names"" and had hoped by not making this information public, they could intercept them should they continue to travel. He said there was little expectation that the pair would end up in a British court, but releasing the evidence would instead add pressure with the intention of ""deterring Russia from doing something similar again"". Police released CCTV showing the two men at Gatwick Airport They were then seen in Salisbury on 4 March, having visited for reconnaissance the previous day ""We must now step up our collective efforts specifically against the GRU,"" Mrs May said on Wednesday. She condemned the ""despicable attack"" and promised ""the full range of tools from across our national security apparatus"" would be used to ""counter the threat"" caused by Russia. Responding in a statement, Russia's London embassy called on the British government to ""give up politicised public accusations"". The embassy statement accused the UK authorities of being unwilling to engage with them, by providing additional information about the suspects such as their passport numbers. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the use of military-grade nerve agent on the streets of Britain was an ""outrage and beyond reckless"". This video can not be played Theresa May gave a statement at Prime Minister's Questions The CPS is not applying to Russia for the extradition of the two men, as Russia does not extradite its own nationals. But a European Arrest Warrant has been obtained in case they travel to the EU. Could suspects be returned to the UK? Russian President Vladimir Putin's foreign policy adviser Yuri Ushakov told reporters the names of the Russian suspects ""do not mean anything to me"". The UK will meet the UN security council to discuss the case on Thursday. Mrs May also said Britain would push for the EU to agree new sanctions against Russia. But BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale said many European countries would be ""reluctant to tighten the screw on Russia"", fearing a loss of trade and energy. Yulia and Sergei Skripal fell ill after Mr Skripal's front door was sprayed with Novichok Sue Hemming, CPS director of legal services, said there was enough evidence ""to provide a realistic prospect of conviction"" and that it was ""clearly in the public interest"" to bring charges. The offences include conspiracy to murder Sergei Skripal; the attempted murder of Sergei Skripal, Yulia Skripal and Nick Bailey; the use and possession of Novichok contrary to the Chemical Weapons Act; and causing grievous bodily harm with intent to Yulia Skripal and Nick Bailey. Scotland Yard's Neil Basu, the head of UK counter-terrorism policing, said that Det Sgt Bailey ""continues to make good progress but remains off work"". Analysis by BBC diplomatic correspondent Jonathan Marcus The decision to identify two named Russian individuals in the Skripal case as agents of the Military Intelligence Service - the GRU -  is a significant development. It raises the level of evidence on which the UK government's charges are based and potentially gives added weight to calls for additional international sanctions against Moscow. This evidence will be presented to the UN Security Council later this week. Already messages have been exchanged between London and Moscow; the British Ambassador there seeing a senior Russian official and a Russian diplomat going into the foreign office here in London. But given that it is highly unlikely that these men will ever face trial, what happens now? The prime minister put her emphasis upon bolstering western democracies' defences - not just in purely military terms, but specifically in countering the powerful intelligence arm of the Russian armed forces, the GRU. Analysis by BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner Less famous than the KGB - or its successor, the FSB - the GRU plays a shadowy but important role in Moscow's strategic plans. It is Russia's military intelligence arm, reporting directly to the defence minister. It has extensive cyber and signals operations and has been accused of hacking and online sabotage. GRU officers are often stationed in embassies around the world and many were expelled after the Salisbury attack in March. Since 2013 Russia's elite Spetznaz (Special Purpose) Special Forces have been part of the GRU's command structure and are believed to have played a part in the annexation of Crimea in 2014. British government officials maintain that the GRU's operations include assassinations both inside Russia and overseas. Sergei Skripal served in the GRU as a military intelligence officer in Afghanistan in the 1980s. In 2006 he was arrested and jailed after reportedly betraying the names of his GRU colleagues to Britain's MI6. In 2010 he was allowed to leave for Britain as part of a prisoner swap, but in the Kremlin's eyes he will always be seen as a traitor. The Metropolitan Police said the two men arrived at Gatwick Airport from Moscow on 2 March and stayed at the City Stay Hotel in Bow Road, east London. On 4 March they travelled to Salisbury - having also visited for reconnaissance the previous day - where Mr Skripal's front door was contaminated with Novichok. Officers believe a modified perfume bottle was used to spray the door. The pair flew from Heathrow to Moscow later that night. While traces of Novichok were found in the London hotel room, there is no risk to other guests who were staying at the hotel at the time, police said. They now want to hear from anyone who was a guest there from 4 March to 4 May. London Mayor Sadiq Khan said he had been assured there was no risk to public health in London. The hotel in east London, where police say Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov stayed before they travelled to Salisbury, is 'open for business as usual' Police said Ms Sturgess and Mr Rowley were later exposed to Novichokafter handling a contaminated container, labelled as Nina Ricci Premier Jour perfume. Mr Rowley told police he found the box containing the small bottle and an applicator - all found to be counterfeit - in a charity bin. He tried to put the two parts together and got some of the contents on himself. His partner Ms Sturgess applied some of the contents to her wrists and became unwell. The counterfeit perfume bottle recovered from Mr Rowley's home and the box police say it came in. The bottle, with a modified nozzle, had contained a ""significant amount"" of Novichok, Scotland Yard said. Mr Basu said: ""We don't yet know where the suspects disposed of the Novichok they used to attack the door, where Dawn and Charlie got the bottle that poisoned them, or if it is the same bottle used in both poisonings."" But he added that the adapted bottle and packaging made it ""a perfect cover for smuggling the weapon into the country, and a perfect delivery method for the attack against the Skripal's front door"". Dawn Sturgess and Charlie Rowley were also poisoned by Novichok Mr Basu confirmed the two poisoning cases were related. ""It now forms one investigation,"" he said. ""We do not believe Dawn and Charlie were deliberately targeted, but became victims as a result of the recklessness in which such a toxic nerve agent was disposed of.""

"This video can not be played On the trail of Russians Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, who UK police carried out a nerve agent attack in Salisbury in March 2018 Vladimir Putin must take responsibility for the Salisbury Novichok attack, UK security minister Ben Wallace has said. Mr Wallace told the BBC ""ultimately, of course"", Russia's president was behind the poisoning of Russian ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in March. The Kremlin, which denies involvement, said it was ""unacceptable"" to make accusations against the leadership. The UK has named two men believed to be from Russia's military intelligence service, the GRU, as the main suspects. Theresa May told the Commons on Wednesday that the suspects had entered the UK on Russian passports using the names Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov. She said the poisoning was ""not a rogue operation"" and was ""almost certainly"" approved at a senior level of the Russian state. Russian spy: What we know so far What happened to the Skripals? Why Novichok stays deadly for so long Mr Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, werepoisoned with Novichokon 4 March. Det Sgt Nick Bailey also fell ill after responding to the incident in Salisbury. Prosecutors say there is sufficient evidence to charge the two men, and UK officials are due to brief the UN Security Council on the investigation on Thursday. Police have also linked the attack to a separate Novichok poisoning on 30 June in Amesbury, that led to the death of 44-year-old mother-of-three Dawn Sturgess. Britain called Thursday's meeting of the UN Security Council, of which Russia is a permanent member, along with China and UK allies the US and France. Mr Wallace said the UK must use the meeting to ""maintain the pressure, to say the behaviour we have seen is totally unacceptable"". He said Mr Putin's government ""controls, funds and directs the military intelligence - that's the GRU"", adding that nobody could say the Russian leader was ""not in control of his state"". BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera said that alongside the meeting, it was thought there would be less visible activity including covert work by British intelligence to disrupt the GRU. Mrs May has also said Britain will push for the EU to agree new sanctions against Russia. Ahead of the UN meeting, Australia said it was ""in lock step with the UK on the importance of holding Russia to account"" over the ""dangerous and deliberate act"". Analysis by BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera The most effective measure, officials claim, may have already been taken in expelling suspected Russian intelligence officers in the UK and from allied countries. Names will also be shared to prevent them being posted to each other's nations. There will be the attempt to use publicity and exposure to make it harder for its officers to travel and operate. Other measures against Russia more generally, it is hoped, might also push the Kremlin to restrain the GRU. Finally, there will be a more clandestine element. This is unlikely to mean ""cyber-war"", rather it will be attempts to disrupt the GRU's own cyber-operations to try to make its life harder. In the evening of 4 March, CCTV showed the pair at Heathrow Airport, where they were to board a flight to Moscow Police are asking the public for information about a suitcase seen in the CCTV image of the two suspects at Heathrow Airport on Sunday 4 March, before they flew to Moscow. In the image, Mr Petrov can be seen pushing a hard dark-coloured wheelie suitcase with a green stripe of the size that can fit into hand luggage lockers. It does not appear that he arrived in the country with the suitcase. The pair are seen in the centre of Salisbury heading towards the train station Counter terrorism officers are also interested in any information the public can give them about the grey and olive backpack that Mr Petrov and Mr Boshirov were both seen wearing at different times on the Sunday. By BBC Monitoring Responding to the fresh accusations, the Kremlin's media machine resorted to its usual tactic: a combination of denials and sarcasm. ""Don't laugh,"" said a talk-show host on state TV, delivering the latest news from London. The foreign ministry's spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, put in an appearance herself to accuse the UK of fabricating the Skripal case. ""This whole story was created to punish Russia... to introduce sanctions,"" she said on Rossiya 1 TV. ""A detective story"" and ""an absurd political thriller"" were some of the epithets used by Russian news bulletins, which also claimed that Britain's allegations were not backed up by a shred of evidence. At the same time, they dismissed the suspects' photographs released by London as crude fakery. ""Put evidence on the table or go to hell,"" said one commentator on Russian state TV. Police released CCTV showing the two men arriving at Gatwick Airport on 2 March They were seen arriving at Salisbury station the following day for what officers said was reconnaissance The Metropolitan Police said the two men arrived at Gatwick Airport from Moscow on 2 March and stayed at the City Stay Hotel in Bow Road, east London.

Officers want to hear from anyone who was a guest there from 4 March to 4 May. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said Petrov and Boshirov should be charged with offences including conspiracy to murder; attempted murder and the use and possession of Novichok contrary to the Chemical Weapons Act. However, it is not applying to Russia for the extradition of the two men, because Russia does not extradite its nationals. But a European Arrest Warrant has been obtained in case the pair travel to the EU. Could suspects be returned to the UK?

Simon Stevens described gambling addiction as one of the ""new threats"" facing the NHS and said reports that foreign betting companies weren't ""co-funding help"" for addicts were ""deeply concerning"". Independent charity, Gamble Aware, said the relationship between sport and gambling had ""reached a tipping point"". The Premier League declined to comment. Mr Stevens said the NHS would be contacting the Premier League to ensure companies that sponsor top clubs ""do the right thing"". Nine Premier League teams are sponsored by betting companies. An estimated 430,000 people in the UK have a gambling problem. Betting companies who profit from the industry in Britain have been encouraged to donate money to the charity Gamble Aware, with a total target of Â£10m a year to help to treat addicts. However, a number of foreign gambling companies that sponsor Premier League clubs have not donated this financial year,The Sunday Times reported in July,external. These included Fun88 (Newcastle) and SportPesa (Everton). Gambling 'rife in football' Speaking at the Health and Care Innovation Expo in Manchester, Mr Stevens said: ""There is an increasing link between problem gambling and stress, depression and other mental health problems. ""Doctors report that two thirds of problem gamblers get worse without help and the NHS does offer specialist treatment. ""But reports that foreign gambling companies are failing to play their part in co-funding help for addicts are deeply concerning. ""Taxpayers and the NHS should not be left to pick up the pieces - the health of the nation is everyone's responsibility. ""The NHS will now work with the Premier League on how we persuade these foreign gambling companies to do the right thing."" This season, ManBetX - an online betting site in Malta - is the official shirt sponsor of Crystal Palace, while Phillipines-based Dafabet is Fulham's official team sponsor. Why are most problem gamblers men? Reality Check: How much of a problem is problem gambling? Betting machine stakes cut to Â£2 Mr Stevens said the NHS needs to get ""more serious about aspects of prevention in public health, including what you might call 'the new public health""'. Around 370,000 11 to 16-year-olds spent money on gambling in the course of one week in England, Scotland and Wales, according to a report published by the Gambling Commission last year. The regulator estimated that 25,000 of them were problem gamblers. A spokeswoman for Gamble Aware said it welcomed the speech by Mr Stevens. ""With nearly half the clubs in the Premier League, and over two thirds of the Championship League sponsored by gambling companies, we are seriously concerned the relationship between sport and gambling has reached a tipping point. ""We would like to see all clubs, leagues, and broadcasters who profit from gambling work with us to help fund treatment for this hidden addiction."" Dr Henrietta Bowden-Jones, spokesman for the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said: ""We certainly want gambling companies to do more to help people with gambling problems. ""The fact is addiction is a severe mental illness and, while some pioneering services like the National Problem Gambling Clinic have been set up, generally addiction services in this country have been stripped to the bare bones. She added: ""We urgently need to find ways for people with gambling and substance use disorders to get access to high-quality treatment.""

"This video can not be played Emlyn Morris was surprised and moved by the choir's performance When 92-year-old Emlyn Morris was given just months to live because of a brain tumour, he never thought he would watch a male voice choir perform again. But, thanks to his carer and family, his dying wish came true when Aber Valley choir made a surprise appearance at his Cardiff home. The terminally ill pensioner got even more than he hoped for when singer Katherine Jenkins sent a message. A tearful Emlyn told family: ""I can't believe it, thank you so much."" More than 20 members of Aber Valley Male Voice Choir snuck into Emlyn's garden The emotional surprise was the idea of Claire James, who cares for Emlyn, a retired steam engine operator, at his home in Llanrumney. ""I said it would be lovely if he saw a choir, but he said it was 'never going to happen', because he knows his fate,"" said Claire. ""So I began contacting every male voice choir in Wales I could think of, to ask if they would come and sing for my boy."" This video can not be played Singer Katherine Jenkins delivered the news of the surprise performance in a video First to respond was Aber Valley Male Voice Choir who, by a wonderful coincidence, are based in Emlyn's childhood village of Senghenydd, Caerphilly. ""We've done more than 1,400 performances all over the world but never anything like this,"" said choir master Geraint Evans. ""But we were more than happy, especially when I found out Emlyn had been a neighbour of my parents and grandparents in Senghenydd."" The people who make last wishes come true Girl's last wish to swim comes true Rugby legends join choir in festival However Claire did not stop there. Buoyed by the response, she set her sights higher. ""I thought, 'If I can get a choir, maybe I can get some stars'. So I contacted Katherine Jenkins and [Opera star] Sir Bryn Terfel,"" she said. ""They couldn't make it on the day but Sir Bryn is arranging to either meet or call Emlyn on the phone and Katherine recorded a beautiful personal message."" Emlyn is a retired steam engine operator In the message, classical music star Jenkins tells Emlyn she was ""sending lots of love."" ""I'll be there in spirit and I very much hope to get to see you very soon,"" she added, before blowing a kiss. Claire and Emlyn's family's plan almost backfired when he began to fear they were arranging his funeral. ""He saw us tidying up the garden and when I asked him about his favourite songs, he got a bit tearful,"" said Claire. ""I had to say we were just arranging a small party, but he still had no idea and it was a great surprise. ""Emlyn is wonderful, the kind of person you'd move the world for. He's so positive and loving even when in agony. ""His mouth fell open when he watched the message from Katherine Jenkins and was very emotional when the choir began to sing. But it didn't stop him joining in."" Dying dog lover granted final wish. Video, 00:00:43Dying dog lover granted final wish Dying mum's wish list.

"Senior ethnic minority doctors in the NHS are paid less than their white counterparts, research suggests. A study in theBritish Medical Journal,externalfound black and minority ethnic (BME) consultants on average earned 4.9% less than white colleagues in basic pay - roughly Â£4,600 a year. The gap was much smaller across other types of doctors and grades. Researchers said the causes of the pay gap for consultants needed to be further explored. NHS groups welcome immigration change Is there institutional racism in mental health care? The report found a small difference in basic pay - which does not include extra pay for over-time and working anti-social hours - between white doctors and those from other ethnic backgrounds across all types and grades. While the the lack of a significant pay gap for most doctor grades was encouraging, the differences at consultant level warranted further investigation and explanation, said report author John Appleby, chief economist at the Nuffield Trust think tank. Average basic pay for white consultants was higher than all other ethnic groups - varying from about 3.5% higher than black consultants, to more than 6% higher than mixed or dual-heritage consultants. Mr Appleby said one possible reason for this was that white consultants tended to be older, which suggested they might be better paid because they were more experienced. But he added: ""However, there will be other explanations too - some warranted, others not so much. These, as with the gender pay gap, are worth investigating further."" However, Dr Chaand Nagpaul, from the British Medical Association, said the study showed that BME doctors faced ""unacceptable barriers, penalties and discrimination in the NHS"". He said: ""It cannot be right that in 21st-Century Britain there are such wide gaps in pay between white and BME doctors in senior posts when, irrespective of their background, they hold positions to deliver the same care to patients. ""The government and the NHS must take this issue seriously and tackle all forms of discrimination within the health service."" The study's findings are based on basic pay data from the NHS electronic staff record for the month of December 2017, for doctors in England directly employed by the NHS. This was combined with doctors' self-identified ethnicity category. A Department of Health and Social Care spokeswoman said: ""The prime minister launched the Race Disparity Audit last October for this very reason -  to examine how people of different backgrounds are treated across all areas of life, and to tackle the injustices that hold people back. ""We have commissioned our own data on ethnicity pay, to identify where the biggest gaps lie in the workforce, and will shortly announce robust plans to tackle these challenges head on, and as part of our long-term plan for the NHS to support the workforce to progress their careers.""

"Ed Sheeran had the biggest-selling album of 2017 Ed Sheeran, Sam Smith and Dua Lipa helped the British record industry earn Â£408m overseas last year, the highest figure on record. Export revenues from recorded music grew by 12% compared with 2016, fuelled by ""phenomenal global demand"" for Ed Sheeran's Divide, said the BPI. The record sold 6.1 million copies last year, beating releases by Drake, Kendrick Lamar and Taylor Swift. But the BPI warned a ""bad Brexit deal"" could harm British music's profits. ""With Brexit approaching, music can help to showcase what is exciting about the UK as we forge new trading relationships,"" said chief executive Geoff Taylor. ""But only if our government supports us by ensuring a strong Brexit deal that enables artists to tour freely, robustly protects music rights, and prevents physical music products being impeded in transit."" The BPI said the value of British music exports - sales of CDs, vinyl, streaming and downloads of singles and albums - has brought in more than Â£5bn since it started tracking revenues in 2000. Europe is currently the record industry's biggest overseas market, generating Â£165m in revenues last year. It is closely followed by the US, which accounts for 35% of the UK's music earnings - but the industry is also seeing rapid growth in new markets including China, India and Brazil. In total, UK artists accounted for one in every eight albums consumed globally in 2017, the BPI said, with British artists creating four of the year's top 10 best-sellers. Once overseas payments were taken into account, the industry contributed Â£200m to the UK economy last year. According to UK Music, the industry's total export revenues are roughly Â£2.5bn, with live music, publishing and royalties also contributing to the coffers.

"The pound has gained strongly against both the dollar and the euro following reports that the UK and Germany have made progress towards a Brexit deal. Sterling rose nearly 1% against the US currency and 0.5% against the euro after the reports on Bloomberg News. However, the pound later gave up some of its gains after London and Berlin both denied there had been any change. The agency said the German government was ready to accept a less detailed agreement on future UK-EU trade ties. The UK and Germany both denied any movement, while analysts warned the EU's stance was not decided by Berlin. ""Germany does not - despite its clear dominance of the bloc economically - actually speak for the EU position,"" said Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, ""[Chief EU negotiator] Michel Barnier may well have something to say about this report. As might Theresa May,"" he added. Mrs May's official spokesman later responded by saying there was no change in the UK's position that ""proper"" information about the future UK-EU relationship had to be available by the time Parliament voted on the withdrawal deal. ""We have always set out that when Parliament votes on this, it needs to be a meaningful vote based on proper information,"" he said. ""We have always been clear that Parliament needs to be able to make an informed decision, and Parliament has also been clear on that. There is no change in that position."" A German government spokesman said: ""The government's position is unchanged. The federal government has full trust in the leadership of Michel Barnier."" Mr Barnier has not yet commented on the report. In late afternoon trading, the pound was worth $1.2902, having earlier traded closer to the $1.30 mark. Against the euro, it fell below â¬1.11, having earlier reached â¬1.1155. ""The ease with which sterling has recently spiked on slim pieces of news tells us a lot about how quickly the pound is likely to rally in the event of any type of Brexit deal,"" said Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at Monex Europe. ""Any deal that avoids the worst-case scenario of a no-deal exit is likely to cause significant sterling strength, even if it is no more than a can-kicking exercise in the classic Brussels style.""
