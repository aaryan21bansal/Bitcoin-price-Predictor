"Lizzie Purbrick entered the south London home of Conservative peer David Prior as a response to seeing him ""in the arms of another woman"" A former Olympic show jumper used pig's blood to daub lewd messages inside a Tory peer's house after he cheated on her, a court has heard. Lizzie Purbrick, 63, entered Conservative peer David Prior's home after seeing him ""in the arms of another woman"". She used a garden sprayer and litres of pig's blood to cover walls with phrases such as ""whore"" and ""lady slut"". She admitted one charge of criminal damage. Camberwell Magistrates' Court heard Purbrick, of West Acre, King's Lynn, Norfolk, also drew a penis on the floor and left a cheque for Â£1,000 at Lord Prior's home in Kennington, south London. Simon Nicholls, defending, told the court the pair, both estranged from their spouses, had been in a relationship for several years, adding that his client felt her affair with Lord Prior ""had longevity"" But, he said: ""To put this delicately, this comes to an end when she discovers him in the arms of another woman who is married to another member of the House of Lords. ""The whole incident she describes as cathartic and she's now moved on. ""This was a one-off offence caused by the breakdown of a relationship."" Mr Nicholls told the court: ""This whole case has the feel of something lifted straight out of the pages of a Jilly Cooper novel."" Purbrick used a garden sprayer and litres of pig's blood to cover walls with phrases such as ""whore"" on 9 May The court heard Purbrick, who handed herself into police straight afterwards, played loud music as she carried out the act - selecting pig blood because the victim ""liked pigs"". A neighbour raised the alarm when blood was seen seeping underneath the door. Mr Nicholls said: ""At 63, she accepts in a way that (the incident) is completely out of character."" District judge Susan Green described the ""series of highly abusive slogans"" as ""quite appalling"". She also sentenced Purbrick to 120 hours' community service and imposed a restraining order. Earlier, Mr Nicholls apologised on behalf of his client after she arrived at court wearing a white t-shirt and pink shorts. Her counsel said she was let down by transport links from nearby Oval station and was in such a rush she did not have time to change into more suitable attire. Speaking after she left the court, and having changed into a grey and yellow dress, Purbrick said she was ""relieved not to go to prison"". ""She was a very nice judge. A sweetheart,"" she said. Purbrick said she was due to catch a flight to South Africa, where members of her family live and where she plans to spend much of her time. Asked about what that meant for her impending community service, she joked: ""I think I've got two years to do 20 hours - I didn't listen to be honest."" Lord Prior, son of former Conservative cabinet minister Jim Prior, was MP for North Norfolk from 1997 to 2001. He was chairman of the Care Quality Commission from 2013 until 2015. Purbrick competed for Great Britain in the 1980 Olympic Games.

"It's time to tackle over-eating from birth to make sure children get the best start in life, according to Public Health England. It comes as government advisers publishnew guidance,external- the first in more than 20 years - on feeding babies. That report suggests three-quarters of UK babies and toddlers may be eating more calories than they should. The same proportion weighed more than the ideal weight for their age, when plotted on growth charts. The data comes from theInfant Feeding Survey,externaland theDiet and Nutrition Survey of Infants and Young Children,externalcarried out in 2010 and 2011. Public Health England says more up-to-date statistics are needed and is recommending the Department of Health and Social Care considers this. Experts know that people who are overweight as children are more likely to be overweight as adults. A link with diet in early infancy is less clear. Nearly a quarter of children in England are obese or overweight at four to five years old. Part of thenext phase of the government's plan to tackle childhood obesity,externalincludes examining whether baby food is healthy enough and whether it contains too much sugar. The new infant feeding guidelines from the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN) recommend: Babies should be exclusively breastfed for around the first six months of life Solid foods can be introduced at around six months Cows' milk should not be given until 12 months Avoid high sugar or high salt foods Foods containing peanut and hens' eggs can be introduced at six months because delaying this might increase the risk of food allergy (but seek advice if there is a strong family history of food allergy) Prof Mary Fewtrell, from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said they noted the concerns raised and said the prevalence of overfeeding and overweight infants should be monitored and addressed. Prof Louis Levy, head of nutrition science at PHE, said ""exclusive breastfeeding until six months of age and not introducing solid foods until around this time"" would help avoid infants becoming ""too heavy"". ""Further consideration is needed on ways to monitor overfeeding and overweight prevalence in infants, to help give them the best start in life,"" Dr Levy said. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""Children aged up to 2.5 years are assessed for healthy weight and nutrition during universal visits - delivered locally by health visitors - who are responsible for measuring and recording weight where there may be a concern. ""While there are currently no plans to reinstate the Infant Feeding Survey, we will consider the SACN report's findings."" Does your baby weigh more than the ideal weight for their age?

"Farmer Sandy Tulloch's local burn is about a foot lower than normal and his spring is running dry Help is being offered to people on private water supplies whose springs and wells are drying up because of the warm weather. About 4% of Scotland's population is ""off-mains"" and the Scottish government says there is a growing risk of them running dry. Ministers will make funds available to local authorities to provide emergency water to affected communities. Solutions range from bottled water to temporary connection to water mains. Finance Secretary Derek Mackay said: ""An adequate supply of drinking water is something that most of us take for granted. However, for those who are not connected to the public supply, this is not the case particularly in prolonged dry periods. ""We are determined to ensure that no one goes without drinking water because of the current dry spell. For this reason, I have confirmed to local authorities and Scottish Water that the Scottish government will cover the additional costs incurred where emergency supplies need to be provided."" Finance Secretary Derek Mackay says no-one should go without drinking water because of the current dry spell Most of those with private water supplies live in rural areas in the north-east and south-west of Scotland. Warnings have already been issued in some areas for residents to use water wisely by, for example, using a watering can instead of a hose in the garden. No plans for Scottish hosepipe ban Millions to face hosepipe ban in north-west England What are the effects of a heatwave? Aberdeenshire farmer Sandy Tulloch has seen his supply drop significantly in recent weeks and is having to ration water use. He told BBC Scotland: ""The water is in dire straits really, we need to get rain pretty quickly and we need to get some heavy rain. ""We have to be very careful with the toilet which is flushed just when you have to. The dishwasher is on every second day on an eco-cycle, which is ten litres, the washing machine is on every second or third day and you just have to be very, very careful."" Pumps which extract 200 litres per second have been installed on the River Spey Mr Tulloch's supply comes from a spring and he believes it will run completely dry within a week. That has not happened on his farm at Lumphanan since 1976. Efforts are underway to keep mains supplies topped up across Scotland by moving water around in tankers and extracting extra water from rivers. Three new pumps, which extract 200 litres per second, have been installed on the River Spey near Fochabers. It is then pumped to a water treatment facility which supplies 20,000 properties in Moray. Scottish Water operations manager Kes Juskowiak said: ""The river levels are low and if you go back to the gauging stations, using Sepa information, you go back to 1954 before you see the river at comparable levels."" Unlike Moray, most of the country is supplied by upland reservoirs and Scottish Water says it has no immediate concerns about security of supply. Residents who think they might be affected are asked to contact their local authority to seek assistance.

"Taking omega-3 fish oil supplements is often touted as a simple way to protect your heart - but experts say the evidence that it does any good is flimsy at best. Cochrane researchers,externallooked at trials in over 100,000 people and found little proof that it prevented heart disease. They say the chance of getting any meaningful benefit from taking omega-3 is one in 1,000. Eating oily fish, however, can still be recommended as part of a healthy diet. The review mainly looked at supplements rather than omega-3 from eating fish. Experts still believe the latter is good for the heart as well as general health. The NHS says people should try to eat two portions of fish per week, one of which should be oily fish, such as salmon, fresh tuna or mackerel, to get enough ""good"" fats. Omega-3 is a family of fats that includes: ALA (alpha-linolenic acid) - which the body can't make for itself but is found in vegetable oils,  nuts and seeds EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) - which the body can make from ALA but are also present in oily fish and fish oils, including cod liver oil Some brands of milk, yoghurt, bread and spreads have extra omega-3 (usually ALA) added to them. But when it comes to fish oil supplements, Cochrane lead author, Dr Lee Hooper, from the University of East Anglia, said: ""We can be confident in the findings of this review which go against the popular belief that long-chain omega-3 supplements protect the heart. ""This large systematic review included information from many thousands of people over long periods. ""Despite all this information, we don't see protective effects. ""The review provides good evidence that taking long-chain omega-3 [fish oil, EPA or DHA] supplements does not benefit heart health or reduce our risk of stroke or death from any cause. ""The most trustworthy studies consistently showed little or no effect of long-chain omega-3 fats on cardiovascular health."" Some fish contain small amounts of chemicals that may be harmful if eaten in large amounts. Shark, marlin and swordfish may contain small amounts of mercury and should be avoided by women who are pregnant or planning a baby and by all children under 16. Other groups should eat no more than one portion of these fish each week. Prof Tom Sanders, a nutrition expert at King's College London and honorary director of Heart UK, said: ""Current dietary guidelines to prevent cardiovascular disease encourage fish consumption, rather than taking supplements. ""This study provides no evidence to suggest that this dietary advice should change."" Prof Tim Chico, a cardiologist from Sheffield University, said: ""There was a period where people who had suffered a heart attack were prescribed these on the NHS. This stopped some years ago. ""Such supplements come with a significant cost, so my advice to anyone buying them in the hope that they reduce the risk of heart disease, I'd advise them to spend their money on vegetables instead."" Dr Carrie Ruxton, from the Health and Food Supplements Information Service, said early studies of omega-3 fats had found a protective benefit for the heart, but it wasn't always easy to pick up the modest effects of dietary change, particularly in older people on medication. ""For those who won't eat mackerel, salmon or herring, a daily fish oil supplement is a useful way of meeting recommendations,"" she said. ""Omega-3s are also used by the body to maintain the health of the eyes, immune function and brain so it's not all about the heart.""

"L-R: Robbie Williams, Ayda Field, Louis Tomlinson and Simon Cowell Robbie Williams is to join the X Factor judging panel when the show returns to screens this summer, ITV has announced. The former Take That singer, 44, fills the vacancy left by long-standing judge Louis Walsh,who quit the show last monthafter 13 years. Louis Tomlinson will join the panel along with Robbie's wife Ayda Field, and long-term judge Simon Cowell. Sharon Osbourne will also be a judge - but only on the live shows that follow the pre-filmed auditions. The new judging panel was unveiled in central London on Tuesday ahead of the auditions, which are set to begin later this week. One Direction's Louis Tomlinson, 26, will take up his position after finding fame on the show in 2010. The Back to You singer appeared as a guest judge at judges' houses in 2015, helping Simon Cowell select which of his acts he would take through to the live shows. Robbie's appointment, meanwhile, sees him emulate his former Take That bandmate Gary Barlow, who was head judge on the ITV show from 2011 to 2013. The star will be forced to miss a number of live shows because he is already double-booked with tour dates in South America. His new role follows his contentious appearance at the World Cup opening ceremony, during which he was seen to ""flip the bird"" on live television. Fox apologises for Williams gesture Williams, whose hits include Angels, Millennium and Rock DJ, holds the record for themost number one albums by a British solo artist. The new foursome have been unveiled as part of a series of changes introduced ahead of the upcoming 15th season, made in a bid toreverse falling ratings. The departing Louis Walsh said the show ""needed a change"" Williams married Field, a US actress and model, in 2010 - she has since found fame in the UK on ITV daytime show Loose Women.

"DC Comics reintroduced Batwoman as a gay character in 2006 A TV adaptation of Batwoman is to become the first live-action superhero series with an openly gay lead character. The show is being developed for the US channel, the CW, adding to the network's collection of shows based on DC comics characters. Batwoman was introduced in the 1950s as a love interest for Batman to dispel rumours of his own homosexuality. The character was reintroduced in 2006 as a gay woman called Kate Kane. She has since become the highest-profile openly gay character of any DC comic.

"Shows like The Crown have helped Netflix woo potential subscribers Video streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime now have more subscribers than traditional pay TV services in the UK, new data from Ofcom has revealed. The media regulator says British TV will have to change the way it operates if it wants to compete with the internet giants. Sharon White, Ofcom's chief executive, says: ""We'd love to see broadcasters such as the BBC work collaboratively with ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 so that they have got that scale to compete globally, making shows together, co-producing great shows that all of us can watch. ""I think it would be great to see a British Netflix."" 7 shows that made Netflix so popular The BBC, ITV and Channel Four have already held preliminary talks looking at the idea of creating a joint streaming service to compete with Netflix and Amazon. The BBC said in its recent annual report that it is facing rapidly rising costs in producing drama and comedy because of the financial power of its new internet rivals. Nearly 40% of UK households now subscribe to Netflix, Amazon Prime or Now TV. The 15.4 million subscriptions have now passed the 15.1 million who pay for Sky, BT, Virgin and other satellite/cable providers. Yet subscriber growth has disappointed recently, prompting a fall in the company's share price Ofcom has also revealed that spending on TV by the BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 has dropped by nearly Â£1 billion over the last 20 years. The decrease from Â£3.4 billion to Â£2.5 billion represents a 28% drop in spending. The new data shows that the long growth of traditional pay TV services stopped last year with a revenue decline of 2.4%. Advertising revenue was also down by 7%. However, Sky and other similar pay TV services made much more money than their new online rivals, with revenues of Â£6.4 billion versus Â£895 million for subscription video on demand services. The number of hours spent watching traditional TV schedules also continued to drop. Teenagers and young people now watch around 40% less than they did seven years ago. Viewing among five to 15-year-olds dropped by 15% in 2017 and by 12% for 16 to 24-year-olds. These figures also include TV that is recorded and watched within seven days after broadcast. YouTube was bought by Google in 2006 Online video continues to grow. Those aged between 16 and 34 now watch around an hour a day of material on YouTube on phones, tablets or computers. TV viewing by people over the age of 65 is unchanged at more than five-and-a-half hours a day - 343 minutes to be precise. That figure is one minute more than what it was seven years ago and is now almost four times the amount watched by children. The median average age of viewers for BBC One, BBC Two and ITV is now over 60. Follow us onFacebook,external, on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external, or on Instagram atbbcnewsents,external.

"TV news footage showing Grenfell Tower in flames led to the fire service abandoning its ""stay put"" advice to residents, a senior officer has said. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Adrian Fenton told the inquiry into the June 2017 blaze that seeing the ""visual overview"" saw him discuss the policy with the control room manager. The standard advice was abandoned two hours after the fire's start. Mr Fenton agreed the images were the ""influencing factor"" for his actions. He was being questioned by counsel to the inquiry, Richard Millett QC, about the scenes in the fire service's incident co-ordination centre and the upstairs control room, where operators were speaking to residents trapped in Grenfell Tower. Grenfell Inquiry: What five reports reveal Why was 'stay put' Grenfell advice so disastrous? Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? Thepublic inquiry into the disasterwhich killed 72 people had previously heard that a television in the control room had been left switched off so as not to further distress the operators. Mr Fenton said he left the control room to look at a TV and saw the side of Grenfell Tower was ""fully engulfed in fire"". He said: ""I was after a visual picture of what was happening on the incident ground, so that's why I went down to look at the monitor screen... to get that visual overview of what was happening."" Mr Fenton told the inquiry he then went ""straight upstairs"" to discuss changing the advice with senior operations manager Jo Smith, whomade the decision to abandon the ""stay put"" policy. The new advice to evacuate was then passed to fire service colleagues on the ground and residents on emergency calls. A ""stay put"" policy is based on the theory that buildings can be designed to prevent fire spreading, so a blaze in one flat should not be able to spread to another. But expert reports submitted to the inquiry suggest that, since 1974, major changes to Grenfell Tower destroyed that protection.

However, it could easily afford the fine if required - its cash reservestotalled nearly $103bn at the end of March,external. This video can not be played WATCH: Margrethe Vestager says the record-sized fine is a result of Google's illegal behaviour At a press conference in Brussels, Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said consumers needed choice. And she suggested the ruling could lead manufacturers to sell smart devices using different versions of the Android operating system to Google's, such as Amazon's Fire OS, which she said they had been prevented from doing. ""This will change the market place,"" she said. Google's chief executive Sundar Pichai has blogged in response. ""Rapid innovation, wide choice, and falling prices are classic hallmarks of robust competition and Android has enabled all of them,""he wrote,external. ""Today's decision rejects the business model that supports Android, which has created more choice for everyone, not less."" Sundar Pichai also released a video clip saying the ruling could ""upset the careful balance of the Android ecosystem"" Ms Vestager previously fined Google â¬2.4bn ($2.8bn; Â£2.1bn) over a separate probe into its shopping comparison service -a ruling the tech firm is in the process of appealing,externalagainst. In addition, her team has a third investigation underway into Google's advert-placing business AdSense. The Dane targeting multinationals Google adds jobs to UK search results Google fined over Shopping service Ms Vestager alleges that there are three ways that Google has acted illegally: it required Android handset and tablet manufacturers to pre-install the Google Search app and its own web browser Chrome as a condition for allowing them to offer access to its Play app store it made payments to large manufacturers and mobile network operators that agreed to exclusively pre-install the Google Search app on their devices it prevented manufacturers from selling any smart devices powered by alternative ""forked"" versions of Android by threatening to refuse them permission to pre-install its apps Ms Vestager acknowledged that Google's version of Android does not prevent device owners downloading alternative web browsers or using other search engines. Google is accused of forcing manufactures to pre-install Chrome by refusing to license its Play Store alone But she said that only 1% of users downloaded a competing search app, and 10% a different browser. ""Once you have it, it is working, very few are curious enough to look for another search app or browser,"" she said. The Competition Commissioner said that Google carried out its abuse at a time when the mobile internet was growing quickly, helping it ensure that its advertising-supported search service repeated the success it had already found on desktop computers. She cannot turn the clock back, but said the size of the fine had been based on the firm's search-related earnings from Android devices in Europe since 2011. She has, however, said the firm must now stop all of the practices outlined above and refrain from any measures with a similar goal. Russia may give one example of how this could be achieved. After similar complaints by the country's regulator, Google now offers Android users a choice between Google, Yandex and Mail.ru as the default search engine the first time they use the Chrome browser. Yandex has seen gained market share on Android phones since Google changed its behaviour in Russia Yandex in particular has benefited from this. Since the change in June 2017, the Moscow-based firm has seen its share of mobile search rise from about 34% to 46%,according to Statcounter,external. The European Commission first began scrutinisingAndroid in April 2015,external, after a complaint by Fairsearch -  a trade group that originally included Microsoft, Nokia and Oracle among its members. It claims the case has dragged on for so long because Google had used ""every trick in its book to delay action"". But the group welcomed the commissioner's intervention. ""This is an important step in disciplining Google's abusive behaviour in relation to Android"", said spokesman Thomas Vinje. ""It means that Google should cease its anti-competitive practices regarding smartphones, but also in other areas - smart TVs in particular - where it is foreclosing competition by using the same practices."" A trade body representing mobile operators has also greeted the development. ""This will enable consumers to benefit from a greater choice of mobile services, and allow more players to innovate and offer new services in the market,"" said the GSMA's chief regulatory officer John Giusti. The European Commission had the power to fine Google up to 10% of its annual revenue.Based on its last annual report,external, that would have amounted to a maximum of $11.1bn (Â£8.5bn). The â¬4.3bn figure is, however, a record-sized sum for the commission. Earlier punishments include: fines totalling  â¬3.8bn against several truck-makers accused of price collusion, which were imposed in July 2016 and September 2017 the â¬2.24bn fine against Google for promoting its own shopping comparison service at the top of its search results, which was announced in June 2017 two fines totalling  â¬1.46bn against Microsoft related to the bundling of its Explorer browser with Windows, and failing to keep a pledge to provide users with a choice of other browsers. The two penalties were announced in February 2008 and March 2013 a â¬1.35bn collective fine against several car glass producers, which had been accused of illegally sharing commercially sensitive information. This was made in November 2008 a â¬1.06bn fine against Intel, which was accused of offering discounts to computer-makers that avoided rivals' computer chips. It was announced in May 2009 a â¬997m fine against Qualcomm, which was penalised over claims it had paid Apple to use its chips. This was announced in January 2018 Depending on your point of view, Margarethe Vestager is either the only global regulator really standing up to arrogant American tech giants - or a busybody trying to hobble innovative businesses because Europe can't build its own. But today's ruling shows the gulf that has opened up between US and European competition policies. In the States the focus is on real and obvious harm to consumers in the form of higher prices or less choice. They also seem more sympathetic to the tech giants' argument that they can be easily toppled from their perches by feisty start-ups. European regulators tend to take a wider view of markets, worrying about a ""winner takes it all"" world, where a few mighty platforms appear to offer consumers a shiny world of free or very cheap goodies, but in reality are devoted to crushing any competition. This culture clash isn't going to fade away any time soon. Cheered on by many who are concerned about Silicon Valley's dominance, Ms Vestager will not abandon her mission to tame the tech giants - and the likes of Google, Apple and Amazon will fiercely resist any regulation that they see as a threat to their lucrative business models.

"The video has racked up millions of views A Canadian scientist's Youtube video about an all natural cancer-curing moss is a social media hit. But it comes with a twist: the health claims in the video are revealed as completely false. Jonathan Jarry, its creator, is a science communicator whose career focuses on debunking misinformation like the claims found in his viral video. The video on the value of scepticism has racked up over nine million views. Mr Jarry, with McGill University's Office for Science and Society (OSS) in Montreal, said he was inspired to make the video when a former co-worker sent him a Facebook post that claimed cancer could be cured by radio waves. It was ""rife with inaccuracies and omissions"" and had been viewed online a whopping six million times, he said. Evidence-based efforts by OSS,  a venture dedicated to promoting critical thinking and the presentation of scientific information to the public, to debunk claims like the radio waves cancer cure theory get barely a fraction of those numbers. ""My idea was let's see if we can build a sort of a Trojan horse,"" Mr Jarry told the BBC. ""And make a video that looks on the outside superficially like one of these easily shareable videos."" He set about cobbling together a video with claims of an ""amazing cancer cure"" discovered by a Dr Johan R Tarjany in the 1800s that has long been suppressed by the pharmaceutical industry - a unique moss that can alter cancer's DNA. Iceman's last meal was high fat feast Cuddly koala's genes could halt sex disease When school science gets 'real' With upbeat music, savvy editing and claims that sound like they have some scientific basis, he mimicked many viral health videos currently spreading misinformation online. But halfway through Mr Jarry's video comes the big reveal: there is no Dr Johan R Tarjany and no cancer-curing moss. It goes on to warn the viewer about how easy it is to get roped into false claims. Jonathan Jarry is a biological scientist who helps debunk false health claims ""The point is, be sceptical. Ask questions,"" it warns. Health misinformation is a serious concern for public health agencies worldwide. In April,Cancer Research UK warned,externalthat belief in fake causes of cancer is rife among the public. In the US, the Food and Drug Administration offersonline guides,externalto protect consumers from products claiming to cure cancer online and on social media. Mr Jarry sees many of the health hoax videos like the one he parodied online and ""they spread like wildfire."" ""We do have to learn to recognise these bad arguments for what they are,"" he said. ""They're an appeal to our emotions, to our superficial level of thinking, but they are empty on the inside."" He sees a danger in people potentially delaying medical treatment in favour of the alternative cures on the belief they will work better than modern medicine, or simply spending money on unhelpful treatments. And he says he is ""flabbergasted"" at how popular his video turned out to be. He had hoped for a meagre 10,000 shares.

"Mr Carr became emotional when he was honoured on Monday A US company owner gave an employee a new car after he went the extra mile - 20 miles (32km) in fact, walking all night to make his first day at work. After his own car broke down, Walter Carr made the long commute by foot through the suburbs of Birmingham, Alabama, to his new job in removals. A police officer spoke to Mr Carr en route and, impressed by his grit, took him to get some breakfast. Praise for Mr Carr has flooded social media since his story was shared. Jenny Lamey, a customer of the moving firm, wrote on Facebook that she and her husband had awoken early last Friday to prepare for movers who were due to arrive at around 08:00.

While helping her with the kitchen, she said, he told her of his childhood in New Orleans, Louisiana, and how his family had moved to Houston, Texas, after their home was destroyed by Hurricane Katrina. ""I just can't tell you how touched I was by Walter and his journey,"" Ms Lamey wrote. ""Seriously?"" he said as he was handed the car keys ""I can't imagine how many times on that lonely walk... in the middle of the night did he want to turn back. How many times did he wonder if this was the best idea."" ""But he walked until he got here! I am in total awe of this young man!"" she continued.

"This video can not be played Listen: Leighanne Bromley has shared the voicemail left by Three Spires Academy School staff unwittingly left an expletive-laden voicemail about an autistic pupil on his ""gobsmacked"" mum's phone. Leighanne Bromley, 29, said Three Spires Academy in Coventry called after Harley, 10, was off sick. But the member of staff who made the call failed to disconnect, and went on to make abusive comments about the schoolboy which were recorded. The school has apologised and launched an investigation. At the start of the 36-second audio clip, a female staff member can be heard asking how Harley is after his absence. A click is heard when she finishes speaking, but the call remains connected. Midlands live: Huge fire at beauty spot; Beggars face town centre ban The woman then strikes up a conversation with a male staff member, saying: ""Make sure he's off all week."" She can also be heard to say she doesn't want to see Harley back ""until the end of the year"". The male voice then says: ""Tell you what - don't bring him back until 22 July... because that's after we break up."" Laughter and swearing can be heard throughout the recording, which has been heard more than 117,000 times since Ms Bromley shared it on Facebook. She held a meeting with headteacher Rob Jones, but fears the school is trying to ""sweep it under the carpet"". Ms Bromley told the BBC: ""I was just gobsmacked and could not quite believe what I was hearing. ""I had to listen to it a number of times as I just couldn't believe it. ""I was horrified and felt like my son wasn't really welcome after hearing that. ""I think both staff members should be fired, but at the very least suspended while an investigation takes place."" A spokesman for the school, which caters for primary-aged pupils with significant learning disabilities, said: ""We offer a full and sincere apology to Leighanne Bromley.

"Dr Denis Furtado has nearly 650,000 followers on Instagram A celebrity Brazilian cosmetic surgeon known as Dr Bumbum has gone on the run after a woman died following injections he gave her to enlarge her buttocks. Investigators say Dr Denis Furtado carried out the procedure on Lilian Calixto at his home in Rio de Janeiro but she fell ill during the procedure. Dr Furtado took her to a hospital where her condition worsened and she died some hours later, police said. He then disappeared and a judge has issued a warrant for his arrest. Dr Furtado, 45, has appeared on Brazilian television and has nearly 650,000 followers on his Instagram account. Ms Calixto, a 46-year-old married mother of two who worked in banking, had travelled from her home in CuiabÃ¡, central Brazil, to undergo buttock enhancement by Dr Furtado on Saturday evening, reports said. The procedure, believed to involve the injection of acrylic glass filler, took place at his apartment in the upmarket district of Barra de Tijuca. Lilian Calixto went to Dr Furtado's apartment for the procedure to enhance her buttocks The Hospital Barra D'Or in Rio de Janeiro said that, despite efforts to save her, Ms Calixto was ""unresponsive to manoeuvres"" and died early on Sunday morning. The exact reason for her death has not been confirmed. Police said Dr Furtado's girlfriend has been arrested on suspicion of taking part in the procedure.

The Regional Medical Council of the State of Rio de Janeiro (Cremerj) said it had opened an investigation into Ms Calixto's death. Niveo Steffen, president of the Brazilian Plastic Surgery Society, said there was a ""growing invasion of non-specialists"" in the industry. ""You cannot perform plastic surgery inside an apartment,"" he told AFP news agency. ""Many people are selling a dream, a fantasy to patients in an unethical way and people, weakened, are often attracted to low prices, without considering whether or not the conditions are adequate."" Dr Furtado has built up a large online following through various social media accounts. Aside from his popular Instagram page, he is also very active on Facebook - filling his page with before-and-after shots of buttocks procedures - and on YouTube, where he presents advice on everything from endometriosis to low-carb diets. In one social media post, he said he was given the name Dr Bumbum by his clients and had embraced it as a term of affection.

"This video can not be played Disabled comedian Tanyalee Davis 'humiliated' on train A comedian has hit out at a train operator after she was ""harassed and humiliated"" for using a disabled space for her mobility scooter. Tanyalee Davis said a guard on a Great Western Railway (GWR) service threatened to call the police if she did not leave the space. Ms Davis said the guard then made an announcement that she was ""causing problems"" which had delayed the train. GWR said staff who saw the video were ""collectively horrified"". Canadian-born Ms Davis, 47, who has a form of dwarfism, was travelling on the 11:00 service from Plymouth to London on Sunday with her partner, Kevin Bolden, who filmed the incident on a mobile phone. She was told to move from the unreserved space after a young mother asked to use it for a pram. Ms Davis, who lives in Norwich, said she felt ""personally and publicly humiliated"" after the guard threatened to call the police. ""He made an announcement... saying that it was 'the woman with the mobility scooter' that was causing problems and that the train would be delayed indefinitely,"" she said. ""It was humiliating and I cried for most of the journey home,"" she said.

"This video can not be played Barack Obama: ""You have to believe in facts"" Barack Obama has used his first high-profile speech since stepping down as US president to take swipes at ""strongman politics"" and politicians' disregard for the facts. His comments are seen as thinly veiled criticism ofthe current US administration's use of what has been described as ""alternative facts"". Here are five key points from his Nelson Mandela lecture, made to the world's media and an audience of some 15,000 people in South Africa's main city, Johannesburg. Obama's speech as it happened ""You have to believe in facts,"" said Mr Obama, ""without facts there is no basis for cooperation. ""If I say this is a podium and you say this is an elephant, it is going to be hard for us to cooperate."" Mr Obama said that he could find common ground with people who disagreed with the Paris accord on climate change - which Donald Trump wants to pull the US out of - if they had an argument based on fact. The term ""alternative facts"" was used by a Trump aide in relation to attendance at his inauguration But, Mr Obama added: ""I can't find common ground if someone says climate change is not happening when almost all the world's scientists say it is. If you start saying it is an elaborate hoax, where do we start?"" Mr Trump has said he thinks climate change is not happening. A moment later, Mr Obama told the audience: ""It used to be if you caught them [politicians] lying, they said: 'Oh man'. Now they just keep on lying."" Barack Obama said striving towards equality ensures a society can draw on the talents and the energy of all of its people. ""Just look at the French football team,"" he said to wild cheers, referring to France's World Cup win days before. ""Not all of those folks looked like Gauls to me, but they are French - they are French."" Fourteen of France's 23-member squad would be eligible to play for African teams It is a ""plain fact"" that racial discrimination still exists in the US and South Africa, Mr Obama said. Analysis by BBC North America reporter Anthony Zurcher Barack Obama offered what some of his supporters will see as not-so-veiled references to his successor in his speech honouring Nelson Mandela's legacy, defending democratic institutions and a free press, and condemning ""strongman politics"" and shameless leaders who ""double down"" when caught lying. The former president also offered a commodity he always seems to have in ready supply - hope. ""Things may go backwards for a while, but ultimately, right makes might,"" Mr Obama said. ""Not the other way around."" It's a riff on the Theodore Parker line he frequently quotes, about the arc of history being long but bending toward justice. If Mr Obama had a message for the world - and particularly for Americans unsure about the course their nation is on - it's that the struggle is real, but the ending is a happy one. There are probably more than a few on the left, however, who wish Mr Obama would give more than a few speeches and carefully worded statements. With mid-term elections that will determine control of Congress just four months away, they want him to step away from the podium and fully join the fight.

Viewpoint: What 'Madiba magic' means to me Barack Obama said the world's elite were out of touch with the lives of the poor. ""In their business dealings, many titans of industry... are increasingly detached from any nation state"" and they ""live lives more and more isolated from ordinary people"", he said. As a result, their decisions to ""shut down a factory"" were seen as simply a ""rational response"" to shareholders' demands. Politicians using ""politics of fear, resentment, retrenchment"" were rising ""at a pace unimaginable just a few years ago,"" Barack Obama warned. Democracy is messy, he said, ""but the efficiency of an autocrat is a false promise"".

That is where democracy comes from,"" he added. Warning against creeping populism and ""strongman politics"", he made the case for liberal democracy, saying that he believed it offered the better future for humanity. ""I believe in Nelson Mandela's vision"" for the world's future, he said, ""I believe that a world governed by such principles is possible"". ""It can achieve more peace and more cooperation in pursuit of a common good,"" he added. ""I believe we have no choice but to move forward... I believe it is based on hard evidence. The fact that the world's most prosperous and successful societies happen to be those which have most closely approximated the liberal progressive ideal that we talk about."" Things may go backwards for a while, but - ultimately - right makes might,"" Mr Obama said. ""Not the other way around."" ""Keep believing. Keep marching. Keep building. Keep raising your voice. Every generation has the opportunity to remake the world,"" Mr Obama said, ending his speech on a positive note. To loud cheers, he called on young people listening to him to get ""fired up"". ""We don't just need one leader... what we badly need is that collective spirit,"" he added. ""Mandela said young people are capable when aroused of bringing down the towers of oppression and raising the banners of freedom,"" he said. ""Now is a good time to be aroused.""

"The Helsinki summit between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump is over, and after nearly two hours behind closed doors and another hour in front of the press, there's plenty of material to sort through. Leading into the meeting, Democrats were warning Mr Trump to be careful in dealing with his Russian counterpart - with some suggesting that it was unwise for the US president to even hold such an event, given Friday's indictments of 12 Russian military officers for conducting cyber-warfare against the US during the 2016 elections. Trump under fire after Putin meeting Russian praise for Putin after Trump summit Trump-Putin: Toolkit to help understand the story Many Republicans, on the other hand, were cautiously optimistic that the president would push back against Mr Putin on a range of issues. Congressman Steve Scalise, a Republican house leader,said,externalthat Mr Trump entered into the negotiations ""from a position of American strength to combat Russian aggression"". Things went â¦ a bit differently. Here are some key takeaways. Mr Trump, in his first question from an American reporter, was pressed to explain why earlier in the dayhe had tweeted out,externalthat US was to blame for the current tense state of US-Russia relations. In his answer, he stood by his earlier comments and said he held ""both countries responsible"". He said both sides had ""made some mistakes"" - but declined to specifically mention items like the Russian military involvement in Ukraine and its annexation of Crimea, the Novichok chemical attack in southern England and the indictment of Russians for meddling in the US election. This video can not be played The ways Trump and Putin see eye to eye Instead, he insisted there was ""no collusion at all"" between his campaign and Russia, conflating charges of election meddling - for which there have been indictments of Russian nationals - with evidence of collusion, which the Mueller probe has not yet alleged. When asked if he would directly condemn Russia and Mr Putin on election meddling, Mr Trump said his intelligence officials - including Director of Intelligence Dan Coats - have told him ""they think it's Russia"". Mr Putin, he continued, just told him it's not Russia. ""I don't see any reason why it would be,"" Mr Trump concluded, apparently leaning toward the Russian professions of innocence over the conclusions of his own government. This has put the US intelligence community in a familiar bind, given Mr Trump's past criticisms. It's a bind, however, for which Trump-appointed leaders, in office for more than a year, are now accountable. Mr Coats has issued a statement saying his intelligence community stands by its ""fact-based assessments"" of Russian meddling and their ""ongoing, pervasive efforts to undermine our democracy"". Later on Monday, the president made an effort, via Twitter, to smooth over ruffled feathers. Mr Mueller has indicted more than two dozen Russians, but Mr Trump still isn't convinced that they're to blame - raising instead questions about the security of Democratic computer servers and FBI bias. The Trump Justice Department, and Mr Mueller's special counsel team, will grind on - Monday afternoon'sannouncement of a Russian woman indicted for being an undisclosed foreign operativeis evidence of that. But Mr Trump's campaign to discredit their work will also continue undeterred. Not surprisingly, Mr Trump's performance was greeted with a mix of condemnation and derision from the left. Senate Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called it a ""shameful performance"" that was ""thoughtless, dangerous and weak"". John Brennan, director of the CIA under Barack Obama, said Mr Trump was guilty of treason. Meanwhile, never-Trump conservatives were quick with ""I told you so-s"". Political consultant (and Jeb Bush advisor) Mike Murphycalled it,externala ""dark day"", after tweeting a string of invective. Former 2008 Republican presidential candidate John McCain said it was ""one of the most disgraceful performances by an American president in memory"". ""The damage inflicted by President Trump's naivete, egotism, false equivalence, and sympathy for autocrats is difficult to calculate,"" the Arizona Republican senator, and chair of the Armed Services committee, wrote in a statement. ""But it is clear that the summit in Helsinki was a tragic mistake."" Perhaps most noteworthy is how Mr Trump is being seen among Republicans who are - or were becoming - more sympathetic to Mr Trump. Abby Huntsman, a conservative commentator and daughter of US ambassador to Russia Jon Huntsman,tweeted,externalthat ""no negotiation is worth throwing your own people and country under the bus"". Newt Gingrich called Mr Trump's statements on intelligence agencies ""the most serious mistake of his presidency"". Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who swings between Trump critic and Trump confidante, was back in the former camp,calling the summit,externala ""missed opportunity"", a ""bad day for the US"" that will be sign of weakness to Russia. New York Post columnist Karol Markowicz, who several months ago had written about how pro- and anti-Trump conservatives had to dial back their rhetoric, was blunt. ""You can love Trump, you can be thrilled he vanquished Hillary, you can be right that Obama's foreign policy was clownish, but call it here: this was atrocious and no American president should ever behave this way."" The Drudge Report had a headline blaring that ""Putin dominates"" the summit. Even on the Fox News cable networks, which are normally Trump's biggest defender and echo chamber, commentators appeared uneasy. Neil Cavuto called the president's performance ""disgraceful"" and said it ""sets us back a lot"". ""There is a growing consensus across the land tonight ... that the president threw the United States under the bus,"" said Fox News White House correspondent John Roberts. Mary Kissel, a member of the Wall Street Journal editorial board, told Fox News audience that ""nothing was achieved"" from the summit. ""The president came off as wanting to have more meetings and going to Putin and asking for Putin's help, when we should be in the position of Putin coming to us and asking us to ease up on him,"" she said. ""Unfortunately, President Putin scored a great propaganda victory."" This could all blow over, of course. With domestic political battles on the horizon - a Supreme Court confirmation and mid-term election contests - the partisan battle lines could quickly re-form. For a moment, however, there was a hint of doubt and concern and the possibility that, at some point in the future, when political expediency is no longer paramount, Mr Trump could face more significant dissention within his ranks. This isn't how Mr Trump and his supporters see it. For them, the summit should be framed as the beginning of a larger effort to repair relations between the world's two largest nuclear powers. ""From the earliest days of our republic, American leaders have understood that diplomacy and engagement is preferable to conflict and hostility,"" he said. Mr Putin echoed those sentiments, calling the summit the ""first important step"". With no tangible results from the summit, the two leaders are framing this as the first of many meetings to come Given the American reaction from across the political spectrum, however, future meetings may be difficult to pull off. After a week abroad, Mr Trump on Monday delivered the coup de grace for what has been a highly disruptive week in US foreign affairs. European allies are uneasy. US-Russia relations are uncertain. And the US political world - and even the White House's own communications team - is unsettled. What comes next? That's unknown.

"This video can not be played The moment President Trump meets counterpart Vladimir Putin. Donald Trump is facing a storm of criticism in America for his performance in Helsinki. His Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin is faring rather better. Back home in Russia, political figures have been lining up to praise the results of the Helsinki summit. ""This is the first important step towards establishing a political dialogue,"" concluded Valentina Matvienko, speaker of the Upper House of the Russian parliament. ""We saw two leaders who wanted to come together to find common ground,"" noted senior Russian senator Konstantin Kosachev. Trump under fire after meeting Schwarzenegger: 'You stood there like a little wet noodle' Trump's 'most serious mistake' The pro-Kremlin newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda consulted a body language expert in an effort to portray President Putin as the stronger leader. ""When he shakes hands, Donald Trump normally extends an open palm to trick his opponent into believing he is open for contact. Then he drags his opponent's hand towards him to put them off balance. ""But in Helsinki he shook Putin's hand quite normally, without any cunning moves. It reflects the results of the meeting and what has happened over the last year: Trump has failed to dominate Putin."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The tabloid Moskovsky Komsomolets claimed that ""a quiet, modest Trump had paled in comparison with Vladimir Putin. It's clear that Putin outmanoeuvred the US president. That is cause for pride, but also for alarm. Because outmanoeuvring Trump does not mean he outmanoeuvred the US political class. I fear it won't be long before Washington responds"". That highlights a potential problem for the Kremlin post-Helsinki. Mr Trump may, on paper, be the perfect American president for Moscow. At the news conference in Helsinki, he may have sided with the Kremlin over his own intelligence agencies on the issue of Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election. He may have declined to blame Moscow alone for the poor state of US-Russian relations. He may have pledged that his administration will work with Russia to resolve all their differences. But will Mr Trump be in a position to deliver? His comments in Helsinki have sparked such anger in America that the US political elite is likely to view any attempt by the Trump administration to mend fences with Moscow with the deepest suspicion.

Republican Senator John McCain described Donald Trump's performance in Helsinki as ""disgraceful"". Add to that the ongoing investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller into Russian interference in the US election, and it becomes clear that, in this febrile atmosphere, an American president who wants to ""get along with Russia"" has little room for manoeuvre.

"An MP who is on maternity leave has accused the government of a breach of trust over a key House of Commons vote on Brexit. Lib Dem Jo Swinson was ""paired"" with Tory chairman Brandon Lewis so she could be at home with her baby son during the Trade Bill vote. This should mean neither MP votes so their absences cancel each other out. But Mr Lewis did vote with the government - he has since apologised for an ""honest mistake"" by whips. Cabinet Office minister David Lidington, a key ally of Theresa May, also apologised, telling BBC Radio 4's Today that it was a ""genuine mess-up"" on his party's behalf which ""clearly should not have happened"". Government survives key Brexit trade vote Proxy voting by MPs 'good for democracy' Lib Dem whip 'messed up' over Brexit vote The row blew up after voting had taken place on the Trade Bill, where the main battleground was an amendment to do with staying in the customs union if the UK fails to agree a trade deal with the EU. The Lib Dems voted against the government alongside Labour, the SNP and some pro-EU Tories, but the government won by 307 to 301. Pairing is an informal arrangement between two MPs of opposing parties that allows them, with the agreement of the Whips (Whips are the MPs responsible for discipline in each party), to miss occasional votes in the House. If two members from opposite sides of the House both agree to miss a vote, then by agreeing to differ they would cancel out each other's vote, so neither member need turn up. Ms Swinson, the deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats and MP for East Dunbartonshire, gave birth to her second son Gabriel on 29 June. She said she had been told Mr Lewis would be her ""pair"" for the votes on the Trade Bill. Mr Lewis did not take part in most of the day's Trade Bill votes, but did take part in the two closest divisions - the one on customs and another on medicine regulation, which the government lost.

On Twitter, Ms Swinson accused the government of ""desperate stuff"" and a ""calculated, deliberate breaking of trust"" by Tory whips. Labour's shadow equalities minister Dawn Butler accused Mr Lewis of ""making politics even more inaccessible for new mums"". In a tweet to Ms Swinson, Mr Lewis said: ""I'm sorry Jo. I think it was an honest mistake made by the whips in fast-moving circumstances. I know how important the pair is to everyone, especially new parents, and I apologise."" In his apology, Conservative chief whip Julian Smith said Mr Lewis had been ""asked to vote in error"". Labour's Harriet Harman said the episode highlighted the need to allow MPs on parenting leave to nominate a proxy on their behalf. The Commons backed this principle earlier this year and a committee of MPs has put forward recommendations for how it might work. Ms Swinson said Parliament should now make a binding decision on introducing proxy voting before it breaks up for its summer recess on Tuesday. In an urgent question in the House of Commons, Lib Dem chief whip Alistair Carmichael said there had been a ""very serious breach of the convention"" and that while he accepted the apology, it was ""less than clear"" to him how it had happened. He described pairing as a ""19th century practice"" trying to cover for ""21st century employment law"" on baby leave. Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom said the incident involving Ms Swinson's vote had happened ""entirely in error"" and ""will not be repeated"". MPs will consider the issue of proxy voting ""at the earliest opportunity"", she added. Speaker John Bercow warned of ""endless procrastination"" over the issue, and said a decision must be made soon. Labour's shadow Commons leader Valerie Vaz said Parliament should agree immediately to ""nod through"" MPs on baby leave. ""It's vital we are a modern workplace and that those on baby leave can have their vote recorded.""

"The homeowner said the house was full of smoke and exploding glass A home has been gutted by a fire started by sunlight shining through a glass ornament in a living room window. The blaze caused extensive damage when it ripped through the bungalow in Bognor Regis, West Sussex. Firefighters said the windowsill trinket had concentrated the sun's rays, producing a magnifying glass effect. West Sussex Fire and Rescue Service warned homeowners to be aware of the dangers of glass on windowsills. It was called house at 18:00 BST on Saturday after being alerted by an automatic fire alarm. The owner of the house, who did not wish to be named, said: ""Within minutes the house was full of smoke with glass exploding."" She said her whole house was fire and smoke damaged. The glass object was on a window sill The homeowner was in the garden when the fire alarm went off. ""It was the scariest situation that I have ever been in - the fire started and grew so quickly,"" she said. ""My whole house is fire and smoke damaged and at the present time, we are unable to live in the property,"" she added.

"Jeremy Corbyn has previously said he is ""sincerely sorry"" for the pain caused by ""pockets of anti-Semitism"" in the Labour Party Labour's ruling National Executive has approved a new code of conduct on anti-Semitism, which has been criticised by Jewish leaders and some of its own MPs. The document was drawn up after protests by Jewish groups against Labour's handling of the issue. It states ""anti-Semitism is racism. It is unacceptable in our party and in wider society"". But it does not fully repeat the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's definition of anti-Semitism. On Monday evening, the Parliamentary Labour Party - MPs and peers - voted overwhelmingly for the full IHRA definition to be adopted. Labour's code, which was approved by a sub-committee of its National Executive Committee (NEC) earlier this month, was drawn up following the 2016 Chakrabarti inquiry into anti-Semitism. The NEC rubber-stamped the new code when it met on Tuesday. But a Labour spokesperson added: ""In recognition of the serious concerns expressed, the NEC agreed to re-open the development of the code, in consultation with Jewish community organisations and groups, in order to better reflect their views."" The code does endorse the IHRA's working definition of anti-Semitism and includes behaviours it lists as likely to be regarded as anti-Semitic - but critics point out that it leaves out four examples from that definition: Accusing Jewish people of being more loyal to Israel than their home country Claiming that Israel's existence as a state is a racist endeavour Requiring higher standards of behaviour from Israel than other nations Comparing contemporary Israeli policies to those of the Nazis The chief rabbi said Labour would be ""on the wrong side"" of the fight against racism unless it toughened up its stance. Labour MP Wes Streeting, co-chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group on British Jews, said the message the new code sends to Britain's Jewish community was ""utterly contemptible"". ""The damage it will inflict on our credibility as an anti-racist political party is the leadership's responsibility - and theirs alone,"" he added. He said he would be ""meeting urgently with our friends in the Jewish Labour Movement to discuss next steps, as this decision cannot go unchallenged"".

"Members of Parliament will not vote on whether to start their summer recess this Thursday, despite the government tabling a motion to do so. A motion to bring forward the summer break by five days was not moved when called by Speaker John Bercow on Tuesday, meaning no vote will happen. It had been tabled amid debates on the prime minister's Brexit plans. Tory MP Nicolas Soames said he was glad the ""idiotic proposal,external"" had been dropped. The government could have been defeated, as a number of Conservative backbenchers were against the motion, as well as Labour and the SNP.

"The government won the vote by 307 to 301 The government has survived an attempt by pro-EU Conservative MPs to change its post-Brexit trade strategy. The MPs wanted the UK to join a customs union if it does not agree a free-trade deal with the EU. But the government, which says a customs union would stop it striking new trade deals, won by 307 to 301. Ahead of the vote, Tory MPs were told a defeat would lead to a vote of no confidence in the government, sources told the BBC's John Pienaar. The government did, however, lose a separate vote on its Trade Bill on the regulation of medicines after Brexit. MPs backed an amendment by 305 votes to 301 that would keep the UK in the European medicines regulatory network. There were 12 Tory rebels in both the customs and medicines votes - but the government's total was boosted by four Labour MPs in the customs vote. At-a-glance: The UK's four Brexit options Brexit: All you need to know Plan 'delivers the Brexit UK voted for' Maternity leave MP accuses Tories over vote The customs union allows for tariff-free trading between members with a common tariff set for imports from the rest of the world. Please upgrade your browser The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019 but the two sides have yet to agree how their final trading relationship will work. The Commons has been debating two pieces of legislation - on customs and trade - and there have been several attempts to change them by both pro-Brexit and pro-EU MPs. The latest key vote was on customs, with a debate sparked by Tory MP Stephen Hammond's amendment to the Trade Bill. It stated that if a free trade area had not been negotiated by 21 January, ministers must change tack and start discussions on joining a customs union. Labour backs the idea of a customs union with the EU after Brexit - but the government says this would mean the UK is unable to strike its own international trade deals. During the debate on the Trade Bill, a minister tried to persuade Mr Hammond and his supporters to back down, promising to deal with the ""essence"" of their concerns when the bill goes to the House of Lords. Although this was rejected by Mr Hammond, the government won the vote and the bill was later approved by the House of Commons. The 12 MPs that voted against the government on customs and trade were: Heidi Allan, Guto Bebb, Ken Clarke, Jonathan Djanogly, Dominic Grieve, Stephen Hammond, Philip Lee, Nicky Morgan, Bob Neill, Antoinette Sandbach, Anna Soubry and Sarah Wollaston. On the other side, four Labour MPs voted with the government: Frank Field, Kate Hoey, John Mann, and Graham Stringer. Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable and his predecessor Tim Farron - who were criticised after missing Monday night's knife-edge Brexit votes - were back at Westminster and voted against the government. But a former Lib Dem minister, Jo Swinson, complained that Tory MP Brandon Lewis participated in the votes despite having agreed to abstain. Ms Swinson, a Remain supporter who has recently given birth and was unable to vote,tweeted,externalMr Lewis did not keep to their arrangement to balance out her effective abstention - known as ""pairing"" - and accused the government of ""desperate stuff"". They didn't escape defeat for long. Having squeaked through last night the government was beaten for only the second time ever in the Commons on key Brexit legislation. And guess what, it was on a vote they didn't expect to lose - Dr Phillip Lee, who quit the government to speak out on Brexit, put forward his own amendment to protect the links between the UK and the European Medicines Agency to ensure the smooth flow of medicines and new drugs for British patients after Brexit. And he had enough to support to win it, just. An embarrassment for the government certainly. It is another reminder of how difficult it is for Theresa May to get her way in the House of Commons where she doesn't have her own majority. It is serious. A defeat is a problem. But it wasn't a complete disaster tonight for two reasons. First, the amendment isn't a million miles away from the government's own policy. While not straightforward, the vote hasn't forced a screeching U-turn. The more important reason is that the vote that followed, on keeping the UK in a customs union, went the other way. Read Laura's blog The vote on medicine regulation was only the government's second defeat on Brexit in the House of Commons. MPs voted for the UK to take ""all necessary steps"" to participate in the regulatory network operated by the European Medicines Agency after it leaves the EU. The agency, which evaluates and supervises medicines and helps national authorities authorise the sale of drugs across the EU, is currently based in London but is moving to Amsterdam after Brexit. There have been warnings that Brexit may cause delays in UK patients getting new drugs. The government says it is ""seeking participation"" in the agency after Brexit and would make an ""appropriate financial contribution"" in return. But it has not agreed to take ""all necessary steps"" to secure this. Responding to the defeat, the government said: ""We will now reflect on this amendment and seek to revisit in the Lords.""

"This video can not be played Trump says he ""misspoke"" at Putin summit, but is it too late? Anthony Zurcher explains US President Donald Trump has said he accepts US intelligence agencies' conclusion that Russia interfered in the 2016 election - despite declining to do so just a day ago. He said he had misspoken on Monday and had meant to say he saw no reason why it was not Russia that meddled. The original comments, after he met Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, drew a barrage of criticism. Even some of Mr Trump's allies had urged him to clarify his stance. Your toolkit to help understand the story Trump's 'most serious mistake' In his latest remarks, he added that he had ""full faith and support"" in US intelligence agencies. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is to appear before Congress next week to answer questions on what happened during Mr Trump's two-hour meeting with President Putin on Monday. Analysis by the BBC's Anthony Zurcher in Washington Does Donald Trump believe in ominous metaphors? As he affirmed his support for US intelligence agencies, the lights went to black in the White House conference room. Once order was restored, he said he had been in the dark as to why a storm had swirled around his presidency since his Helsinki summit with Vladimir Putin. It was, he said, because he had misspoken. That is going to be hard for many of the president's critics to swallow, however. Even if he did mean to say, ""I don't see a reason why it wouldn't be Russia"", it is a pretty weak way to confront the head of a nation accused of targeting the heart of American democracy. What is more, the context of the president's comments make a simple slip of the tongue seem less likely. At the very least, the president gave his supporters some material to rally around. The damage, however, has been done. Mr Trump can give as many White House statements as he likes, but on the biggest stage - standing beside the Russian president - he fumbled. All the explanations cannot change that. The controversy centres on a response he gave to a question at a news conference on Monday following the summit with Mr Putin. This is an extract fromthe transcript posted by the White House,external. REPORTER: President Putin denied having anything to do with the election interference in 2016. Every US intelligence agency has concluded that Russia did. My first question for you, sir, is, who do you believe? Schwarzenegger calls Trump a 'wet noodle' 'Double negative' is not not trending TRUMP: My people came to me... they said they think it's Russia.  I have President Putin; he just said it's not Russia. I will say this: I don't see any reason why it would be. Mr Trump said he had reviewed the transcript and realised he needed to clarify. ""In a key sentence in my remarks, I said the word 'would' instead of 'wouldn't,"" he said. ""The sentence should have been: 'I don't see any reason why I wouldn't' or 'why it wouldn't be Russia'. Sort of a double negative."" The US president added: ""I accept our intelligence community's conclusion that Russia's meddling in the 2016 election took place. Could be other people also. A lot of people out there."" This video can not be played The ways Trump and Putin see eye to eye Mr Trump said that the interference had had no impact on the election, in which he defeated Hillary Clinton. However, he did not respond when reporters asked him if he would condemn Mr Putin. During the press conference with President Putin - in the same answer as the transcript above - Mr Trump went on to say: ""President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today. And what he did is an incredible offer; he offered to have the people working on the case come and work with their investigators with respect to the 12 people. I think that's an incredible offer."" On Wednesday,Mr Trump said in a tweet that Russia had ""agreed to help with North Korea"",external, adding that ""the process is moving along"". ""There is no rush, the sanctions remain! Big benefits and exciting future for North Korea at end of process!"" the president wrote. He said that his meeting with Mr Putin was ""positive"" and ""may prove to be, in the long run... a success"". He added that because he ""got along"" with the Russian leader, it ""bothered many haters"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Republicans and Democrats alike were dumbfounded that Mr Trump had sided with Russia over his own intelligence officials after Monday's summit. The US and Russia have been long-term adversaries and remain far apart on major issues. Some lawmakers were also upset that Mr Trump had refused to offer specific criticisms of Russia and Mr Putin, instead saying both countries were responsible for poor relations. Even one of his most loyal Republican supporters, Newt Gingrich, said the comments were the ""most serious mistake of his presidency"". House Republican Mike Turner accused Mr Trump of having damaged American foreign policy by failing to take Russia to task.

"With the UK on course to leave the European Union in March next year, the country faces four possible scenarios. The UK and the EU both insist they want as amicable a divorce as possible, with a legal agreement setting out the kind of relationship they will have when the UK is no longer a member of the club. MP quits as minister over Brexit vote Reality Check: What does the Brexit White Paper reveal? Brexit: All you need to know Prime Minister Theresa May wants to keep close ties with the EU in certain areas, such as trade in agricultural products and allowing skilled migrants access to jobs in the UK. She saysher plan,externalwill allow Britain to take back control of its laws, money and borders, just like people voted for in the 2016 EU referendum, while also allowing as ""frictionless"" trade as possible and avoiding a physical border for Northern Ireland. But it has been attacked as an unworkable compromise by people from both the Remain and Leave ends of the debate. The EU may also decide to reject it, but the two sides are still hoping to strike some kind of deal by the autumn and, despite criticism and ministerial resignations, Mrs May believes this is the best option. A clean break with the EU. The UK would fall back on its membership of the World Trade Organization (WTO), the global body governing international trade. UK exports to the EU would be subject to the same customs checks and taxes the EU currently imposes on countries like the United States. Those arguing for this option - the so-called ""hard Brexiteers"" - say it would create a truly independent nation able to strike its own beneficial trade deals around the world. But opponents say it would be catastrophic for British business and have warned about chaos at the borders, higher food prices and shortages in the shops. The UK has formally triggered the mechanism to leave the EU at 23:00 GMT on 29 March, 2019. To reverse that at this late stage would mean a huge loss of political face, and probably require a new prime minister, with the backing of voters in a general election. European Council President Donald Tusk has said he believes Brexit can be halted - but there is some debate about whether the Article 50 process, the two-year legal mechanism taking the UK out of the EU, is reversible. (You can read a fullBBC Reality Check on the debate here.) If the UK did leave and wanted to immediately rejoin, it would need all the other EU member states to agree. A less formal version of staying in the EU would be if the UK strikes a deal that keeps it in the EU's trade arrangements - the customs union and the single market - and agrees to free movement of people and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. This would amount to staying in the EU, Brexiteers argue. The UK government has ruled this out but there have been a number of people calling for a fresh vote - includingJustine Greening. Reality Check: How would the UK hold a second EU referendum? With Parliament apparently split over what kind of Brexit it wants, a referendum on the final deal agreed by Theresa May in Brussels might yet end up being the only way to break the deadlock. Those campaigning for another referendum say voters should get the final say, including the option of staying in. Labour's leadership say a general election should be held rather than another referendum.

"Brexit campaign group Vote Leave has been fined Â£61,000 and referred to the police after an Electoral Commission probe said it broke electoral law. The watchdog said it exceeded its Â£7m spending limit by funnelling Â£675,315 through pro-Brexit youth group BeLeave. The founder of BeLeave, Darren Grimes, has been fined Â£20,000 and referred to the police, along with Vote Leave official David Halsall. Vote Leave said the ""wholly inaccurate"" report was politically motivated. The Vote Leave campaign, which was fronted by Boris Johnson and Michael Gove, won the contest to be the official Leave campaign in the 2016 referendum on whether Britain should stay in the European Union. Parliament Live: MPs debate post-Brexit trade plans Leave.EU fined Â£70,000 over Brexit spending Call for 'clarity' on referendum cash rules Brexit: All you need to know The result of the referendum was 51.9% for Leave and 48.1% for Remain. The UK is due to officially leave the European Union at 23:00 GMT on 29 March, 2019. The referendum was not legally binding, merely ""advisory,""according to a Supreme Court judgement in December 2016, so it can't be ordered to be re-run by a court - any decision to have a fresh referendum would have to be made by the government and Parliament would have to pass a referendum act. Reality Check: How would the UK hold a second EU referendum? The Electoral Commission has referred Mr Grimes and Mr Halsall to the Metropolitan Police in relation to false declarations of campaign spending, and handed over files ""in relation to whether any persons have committed related offences"" that fall outside the watchdog's remit. Darren Grimes founded youth group BeLeave Vote Leave and the official Remain campaign Britain Stronger in Europe were allowed to spend Â£7m each on campaigning in the run up to the referendum. Vote Leave spent nearly Â£2.7m of its Â£7m budget on the services of a Canadian digital marketing firm, Aggregate IQ. A further Â£675,315 was sent to Aggregate IQ by BeLeave, a group set up by Mr Grimes, then a fashion student at Brighton university. The money came from Vote Leave which has said in the past it was told by the Electoral Commission it was allowed to do this because BeLeave was a separate campaign group. But the Electoral Commission - which is the watchdog overseeing elections in the UK and ensuring that UK laws on spending by political parties are followed - has ruled that the two groups were working together and Mr Grimes had ""wrongly"" reported the spending as his own. This meant that, including this amount, the Electoral Commission says Vote Leave spent Â£7,449,079, breaching its Â£7m spending limit. Darren Grimes is also said to have exceeded the Â£10,000 he was allowed to spend as a non-registered campaigner, the watchdog said. Bob Posner, from the Electoral Commission, said: ""We found substantial evidence that the two groups worked to a common plan, did not declare their joint working and did not adhere to the legal spending limits. These are serious breaches of the laws put in place by Parliament to ensure fairness and transparency at elections and referendums."" He added: ""Vote Leave has resisted our investigation from the start, including contesting our right as the statutory regulator to open the investigation. It has refused to cooperate, refused our requests to put forward a representative for interview, and forced us to use our legal powers to compel it to provide evidence. ""Nevertheless, the evidence we have found is clear and substantial, and can now be seen in our report."" It is impossible to say how overspending by the Vote Leave campaign affected the referendum result. It all went to one marketing firm, which developed highly-targeted Facebook advertising. In a quote since removed from the Aggregate IQ website, Vote Leave campaign director Dominic Cummings said: ""We couldn't have done it without them."" Former Vote Leave activist Shahmir Sanni, who went public with allegations about overspending earlier this year, told BBC Radio 4's The World at One the extra cash spent by BeLeave had affected the referendum outcome - saying such a sum ""can make all the difference"". Anti-Brexit Labour peer Lord Adonis said Vote Leave's overspending ""could have been decisive"" in the 2016 referendum because it was a close result but he did not want to re-run that campaign. Instead, he said ""all of those responsible for this breach of the law"" should be ""barred"" from playing any part in any future referendum, such as the one he is calling for on the final Brexit deal. This video can not be played MPs expressed their anger at Vote Leave Labour is calling for Tory ministers who were key figures in Vote Leave to be referred to the cabinet secretary to determine whether they had broken the ministerial code. In a statement on Twitter, Mr Grimes said it was ""incredible"" that he had been fined Â£20,000 ""on the basis of the wrong box being ticked on an application form"". He said he had been interviewed by the Electoral Commission during two previous investigations and had never been ""provided with particulars"" of the allegation that he had worked on a ""common plan"" with Vote Leave so that he could ""make representations about it"". ""Politicians say they want young people to engage with politics. I was 22 when I got involved in a referendum I felt passionately about. I did nothing wrong,"" he added. ""I have been persecuted for over two years by powerful people for nothing more than engaging in the democratic process and having the temerity to be on the winning side. It has been appalling for my family."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Electoral Commission cleared Vote Leave of breaking spending limits in March last year but re-opened its investigation in October, saying new evidence had come to light from its own investigations, media reports, academics and whistleblowers. Third Vote Leave whistleblower revealed Another pro-Brexit group, Veterans for Britain, was also found to have inaccurately reported a donation it received from Vote Leave and has been fined Â£250. Vote Leave also returned an ""incomplete and inaccurate spending report"", with almost Â£234,501 reported incorrectly, and invoices missing for Â£12,849.99 of spending, the watchdog said. A Vote Leave spokesman said: ""The Electoral Commission's report contains a number of false accusations and incorrect assertions that are wholly inaccurate and do not stand up to scrutiny. ""It is astonishing that nobody from Vote Leave has been interviewed by the commission in the production of this report, nor indeed at any point in the past two years. Yet the commission has interviewed the so-called 'whistleblowers' who have no knowledge of how Vote Leave operated and whose credibility has been seriously called into question. ""Vote Leave has provided evidence to the Electoral Commission proving there was no wrongdoing. And yet despite clear evidence of wrongdoing by the Remain campaign, the commission has chosen to ignore this and refused to launch an investigation. ""All this suggests that the supposedly impartial commission is motivated by a political agenda rather than uncovering the facts. ""The commission has failed to follow due process, and in doing so has based its conclusions on unfounded claims and conspiracy theories. ""We will consider the options available to us, but are confident that these findings will be overturned."" This video can not be played Former Vote Leave chief Matthew Elliott defended his group's actions The Electoral Commission hit back at allegations of political bias, saying: ""We open investigations where the evidence justifies it, irrespective of the political views of the party or campaigner concerned."" It also insisted it had followed ""due process"" and had spent three months and made five attempts to interview Vote Leave representatives. Months into the investigation, ""certain Vote Leave staff members came to us separately and offered to be interviewed"", an Electoral Commission source said, but by that point it had gathered enough evidence to conclude that an offence had occurred. Asked whether it believed the referendum result was still valid, No 10 said the public delivered a ""clear verdict"" which the government was in the process of implementing. But speaking in the Commons, former Tory home secretary Amber Rudd said ministers should not use this to ""obfuscate"" from its duty to protect the electoral system from abuses. And Tory MP Sarah Wollaston, who voted to remain, called for the referendum to be re-run. A separate Brexit campaign, Leave.EU, was fined Â£70,000 in March for failing to declare ""at least"" Â£77,380 it spent on referendum campaigning. Leave.EU chief executive Liz Bilney was referred to the police following the commission's investigation. Leave.EU co-founder Arron Banks called it a ""politically motivated attack"" and said he would take the watchdog to court. Leave.EU, which was fronted by then-UKIP leader Nigel Farage, was only allowed to spend Â£700,000 in the run up to the referendum, after losing out to Vote Leave in the battle to designated the official Leave campaign. The official Remain campaign Britain Stronger in Europe, was fined Â£1,250 in December last year for not providing invoices and for declaring some spending in aggregate rather than individual payments.

"This video can not be played Holiday credit card charges - and how to avoid them UK holidaymakers are being collectively charged Â£1bn a year by their banks for paying by credit or debit card while they are abroad. Standard credit and debit cards slap fees of nearly 3% on all spending, plus extra costs for using cash machines. Customers are being encouraged to apply for cards with zero charges to make their holiday money go further. But banks say using cards overseas is a safe, flexible and cost-effective way of paying. Tourists warned over exchange rate costs Staycation trend cuts use of cards abroad Holidaymakers we spoke to in Malaga were shocked to be told about the billion pound figure, which has been calculated exclusively for BBC News. ""That is outrageous! They are surcharging us for going on our holidays,"" said Val Pollard who was sunning herself on the beach. ""You are likely to be spending â¬500-â¬800 a week. 3% of that is a lot of money."" For those using a standard credit card, the average ""non-sterling transaction fee"" is 2.8%, added to the amount you have spent, with some banks charging 2.99%. The average fee on standard debit cards is nearly as much. And there are multiple charges if you use a debit card to withdraw cash: an average of 2.5% on the whole amount, plus an extra fee of Â£1.39 on average just for using a foreign cash machine. The charges appear on your bank statements when you return home. Alan and Marie Carman from King's Lynn, taking Malaga's open-top bus tour, told me that banks are ""on to a winner"" because people use their cards without thinking. ""I don't think they should do that charge,"" says Marie, ""I don't think they should rip people off, because nowadays everybody uses cards."" Even the proprietor of the Shakespeare Pub, a British outpost in the centre of Malaga, believes he is affected. ""It has a knock-on effect on me,"" explained Peter Edgerton, ""The customer is less likely to spend here if they know they're likely to be charged 3% every time they use their card."" The most recent figures from the banks themselves show that UK holidaymakers are spending a total of more than Â£32bn a year on their cards while overseas. The charges on that spending are having a ""huge impact on consumers' pockets"", according to the foreign exchange specialists, FairFX, which analysed the charges for BBC News. ""When we're on holiday it's easy to turn a blind eye to what we think is just a few quid,"" said Ian Strafford-Taylor, FairFX's chief executive. Cards do have advantages. A spokeswoman for UK Finance, the body which represents banks, describes them as an ""extremely safe, flexible and cost-effective way to pay"". ""If you do not get what you paid for, if the goods or services turn out to be faulty or you are a victim of card fraud, you will get your money back"". UK Finance points out that some banks offer alternative credit cards which have no fees when you spend overseas. Among them are cards from Halifax, Santander, Nationwide and Barclays, though there is no guarantee that you will be accepted for one of these if you apply. You can also buy pre-paid currency cards which have zero charges, though the exchange rates they use can vary. Joanna Styles, who runs a tourist website guidetomalaga.com, wants banks to be forced to text customers whenever they levy a foreign currency charge, to encourage them to shop around. ""I know for a fact that in Malaga you could have several good meals out for the amount that you have effectively given to the bank,"" she said. Most people do not shop around. They obtain their credit cards from the bank which handles their current accounts. So FairFX also looked at what annual charges would be if all customers at least switched to the lowest-cost card which their own bank had on offer. The result? Charges for foreign spending would be lower, by nearly Â£300m. But the total would still add up to Â£738m a year.

"There were 9,115 children's books printed in the UK in 2017 Children's books should feature more ethnic minority characters in central roles, a literacy charity has said. The Centre for Literacy and Primary Education also said black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) characters should not be mainly defined by their struggle, suffering or ""otherness"". It saidmore than half the 400 books,externalit looked at featuring BAME characters covered issues such as war and racism. The Publishers Association said diversity issues were being worked on. In the study, funded by Arts Council England, 40 publishers submitted 587 books from 2017, of which 391 met CLPE's criteria of being written for children aged between three and 11 and featuring at least one BAME character. Of those, 56% involved ""contemporary realism"" issues such as war, refugees and racism, compared to just 0.6% being classed as a comedy. Other categories included fantasy (20%), historical fiction (9%) and science fiction (4%). CPLE is recommending that: Representation of BAME characters should be ""meaningful and accurate"" thereby ""better reflecting the UK population"" Stories should allow for cultural details ""without reducing characterisations to derogatory stereotypes"" BAME characters should be central and not only predominantly feature in the margins Non-fiction needs to be ""more representative"" BAME characters should ""exist across a range of genres"" to ""allow readers to experience the full spectrum of emotions"" Project leader Farrah Serroukh said: ""If young readers are only experiencing characters from certain backgrounds in certain contexts, it tends to skew their perspective on those people. ""If you only see them in a social justice context or as struggling, being oppressed or on a quest for liberation, then the understanding can be diminished for both BAME and non-BAME children."" CLPE also said only 4% of the 9,115 children's books published in the UK in 2017 had a BAME character, although the data on how many publishers of those books submitted their work for the survey has not been made available. Ms Serroukh said: ""The findings are not particularly surprising, this has been a gut instinct for those working in the children's books industry for some time. ""Ultimately what we want to see is a balanced diet of books on the shelf. ""Children have to have access to a wide and varied range of literature."" She said the industry should ""invest in both established and new authors"" and stories should be ""thoroughly researched"" and all characters should be ""respectful, nuanced and layered"". This is the first survey of its kind to be carried out in the UK and Ms Serroukh hopes it will become an annual investigation. She said: ""In time, what we want is there to not be a need for this survey."" Sonal Sachdev Patel and Jemma Wayne-Kattan have written GITA: The Battle of the Worlds Author Sonal Sachdev Patel said she wanted to write her book GITA: The Battle of the Worlds, co-authored with Jemma Wayne-Kattan, because there was a lack of books for her children. She said: ""I think it's really important we talk about BAME communities in a representative way so readers do not see them only associated with these issues. ""I want my children to be able to know about their culture but also embrace what the best of British is. ""Until we increase the representation of BAME characters in our books we can never build the understanding we need of each other. ""Respect comes from understanding and exposure."" Stephen Lotinga, chief executive of the Publishers Association, said CLPE's figures are ""sobering"" and publishers are ""genuinely working to try and address representation in their books"". He said: ""There is a real will for change, these figures show that there is still a huge amount of work to be done."" Mr Lotinga also said many publishers are ""making significant efforts"" to make their workforces more diverse which, in time, is ""likely to help in terms of the books that are published"". Francesca Dow, managing director of Penguin Random House Children's, said the company was ""already very much aware that there are still too many stories which are not being told and too many voices being overlooked"". She said the firm runs several schemes to increase diversity of authors. Ms Dow said: ""We want to give every child the opportunity to be able to see themselves in books and to see their experiences, cultures and communities reflected and also for books to be their window on to other cultures.""

"This video can not be played Holiday credit card charges - and how to avoid them UK holidaymakers are being collectively charged Â£1bn a year by their banks for paying by credit or debit card while they are abroad. Standard credit and debit cards slap fees of nearly 3% on all spending, plus extra costs for using cash machines. Customers are being encouraged to apply for cards with zero charges to make their holiday money go further. But banks say using cards overseas is a safe, flexible and cost-effective way of paying. Tourists warned over exchange rate costs Staycation trend cuts use of cards abroad Holidaymakers we spoke to in Malaga were shocked to be told about the billion pound figure, which has been calculated exclusively for BBC News. ""That is outrageous! They are surcharging us for going on our holidays,"" said Val Pollard who was sunning herself on the beach. ""You are likely to be spending â¬500-â¬800 a week. 3% of that is a lot of money."" For those using a standard credit card, the average ""non-sterling transaction fee"" is 2.8%, added to the amount you have spent, with some banks charging 2.99%. The average fee on standard debit cards is nearly as much. And there are multiple charges if you use a debit card to withdraw cash: an average of 2.5% on the whole amount, plus an extra fee of Â£1.39 on average just for using a foreign cash machine. The charges appear on your bank statements when you return home. Alan and Marie Carman from King's Lynn, taking Malaga's open-top bus tour, told me that banks are ""on to a winner"" because people use their cards without thinking. ""I don't think they should do that charge,"" says Marie, ""I don't think they should rip people off, because nowadays everybody uses cards."" Even the proprietor of the Shakespeare Pub, a British outpost in the centre of Malaga, believes he is affected. ""It has a knock-on effect on me,"" explained Peter Edgerton, ""The customer is less likely to spend here if they know they're likely to be charged 3% every time they use their card."" The most recent figures from the banks themselves show that UK holidaymakers are spending a total of more than Â£32bn a year on their cards while overseas. The charges on that spending are having a ""huge impact on consumers' pockets"", according to the foreign exchange specialists, FairFX, which analysed the charges for BBC News. ""When we're on holiday it's easy to turn a blind eye to what we think is just a few quid,"" said Ian Strafford-Taylor, FairFX's chief executive. Cards do have advantages.

"The government has urged pro-EU Conservative MPs to ""work with us"" as it seeks to avoid a Commons defeat on post-Brexit customs. Several Tories have expressed support for a call for the UK to stay in a customs union if there is no trade agreement by 21 January 2019. The government says joining a customs union would prevent it from striking trade deals with other countries. MPs have started voting on suggested changes to the Trade Bill. The government has already lost one vote, with MPs backing an amendment that would keep the UK in the European medicines regulatory network. MPs are now voting on the customs union amendment tabled by pro-EU Stephen Hammond. Live: MPs debate Trade Bill At-a-glance: The UK's four Brexit options I had no choice but to quit, says Bebb Cable Brexit vote absence 'unfortunate' Mr Hammond said his amendment was ""exactly in line"" with the negotiating position set out by the government last week. It supports the government's aim of negotiating a free trade area for goods but states if this has not happened by 21 January, ministers must change tack and start discussions on joining a customs union. Trying to avoid a rebellion, International Trade Minister George Hollingbery offered to make new changes to the bill when it reaches the House of Lords. ""Let's do this the other way round,"" Mr Hammond replied, urging the government to accept his amendment instead. The motion on joining a customs union is being backed by Labour, making the risk of defeat more likely. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019 but has yet to agree how its final relationship with the bloc will work. The government, which does not have a Commons majority, has been under pressure from MPs on both sides of the Brexit debate. The Trade Bill would create new structures for dealing with trade disputes after Brexit and carry over up to 40 existing EU trade agreements with other countries that the UK wishes to stick with until new deals are struck. The government twice survived by just three votes on Monday after a backlash from pro-European Tories who accused the prime minister of ""caving in"" to the party's Eurosceptic MPs.

"The House of Lords debates private members' bills Richard Morris, Lucy Webster and Robbie Hawkins Profiles of eight people who will work out the detail of the exit deal. The UK and EU agree there should be no hard border post-Brexit, but are at odds on how to achieve it. That's where we leave our coverage of the week in Parliament. We'll be back on Monday at 2.30pm for more from the Commons and the Lords. European Union (Information) Bill House of LordsParliament Peers have debated the European Union (Information, etc.) Bill, introduced by crossbench peer, Lord Dykes. The bill would require the government to provide information relating to the EU in written and electronic forms; and local authorities would be required to distribute the information free of charge in public buildings. The bill defines information as the purpose, scope and effect of the EU's activities and how it is organised, while another section of the bill would require information on the EU's town twinning scheme to be made available. The bill was given second reading and will now be considered at committee stage. Children Act (Amendment) Bill House of LordsParliament Peers give the bill a second reading, and it will now proceed to committee stage, where it will be examined in greater depth. The government is heading towards the summer break, wracked by infighting among Tory MPs. Children Act (Amendment) Bill House of LordsParliament You can read moreabout the bill here,external. Currently, Female Genital Mutilation Protection Orders safeguard victims under the Female Genital Mutilation Act. This bill would allow courts to make interim care orders under the Children Act 1989 in cases relating to FGM. The interim order would mean local authorities would have shared parental responsibility for the child. Children Act (Amendment) Bill House of LordsParliament Peers now listen to Lord Berkeley of Knighton introducing a bill which would amend the Children Act of 1989, to protect girls at risk of female genital mutilation. Crossbencher Lord Berkeley says the 1989 act does not currently protect girls at risk of this specific offence, and this amendment bill would do that. He says he was horrified to learn about FGM when he attended a debate led by the late Lady Rendell, and he says that there is no basis for the practice in religion. Education is the best way to stop FGM, as it is often a practice passed from grandmother to mother, he says, and it is often done for the supposed benefit of men. Civil Partnership Act 2004 (Amendment) Bill House of LordsParliament The bill passes its second reading and moves to committee stage. Civil Partnership Act 2004 (Amendment) Bill House of LordsParliament Minister Baroness Williams sums up for the government, but says that while she has listened carefully to the arguments, she is unconvinced that the bill offers a solution to the problems explained by campaigners. In his speech, Lord Lexden refers to a campaigner on the issue, Olivia Utley, who wrote an article about the issue for The Times. You canread it here,external. She says: I was brought up by my mother and her sister in as a stable a unit as one could possibly imagine. Iâve never considered my aunt as anything other than a parent, and to anyone who knows us, the idea that we âarenât a familyâ would seem absurd.  But the law says otherwise.  The sisters who raised me have no legal means by which to make their relationship official, meaning that they are exempt from the rights afforded to civil partners and married couples; most importantly the right to inherit a joint tenancy, and the right to pass on a jointly owned home to each other free of inheritance tax.  Civil Partnership Act 2004 (Amendment) Bill House of LordsParliament You can read more about the billhere,external. It is being proposed by Conservative Lord Lexden Lord Lexden says his bill would ""extend new rights"" and confer on thousands of men and women the legal status which ""they have hoped for"". Sibling couples may have decided to spend their lives together in homes until their death and ""special recognition should be given to them"" he says. House of LordsParliament The first bill for consideration today is the Civil Partnership Act 2004 (Amendment) (Sibling Couples) Bill. This bill would amend the Civil Partnership Act 2004 to include sibling couples. Welcome to coverage of today's events in Westminster - we'll be covering the House of Lords today, as peers debate private members' bills. Dominic Raab meets the EU's chief negotiator, as the IMF warns Ireland will be hit hard by a no deal Brexit. What happened? House of CommonsParliament The Commons agreed on a new code of practice for dealing with complaints and grievances for staff working in the Commons. The decision made today will be subject to a review in six and 18 months' time, and is the result of a cross-party effort to standardise practices for dealing with complaints. The government confirmed that it would be updating and changing mandatory sex and relationships education in schools, and MPs heard an urgent question from Labour on ESA underpayments. The Commons returns at 2:30pm on Monday with Housing, Communities and Local Government questions. Tobacco Control Plan House of CommonsParliament Wrapping up the debate on the Tobacco Control Plan, Health Minister Steve Brine thanks MPs for their remarks on smoking. He says local authorities are not the only ones responsible for helping quitting smoking as some suggests, and that there are new grants available for others to provide the services. Asked whether there are plans for ""vaping areas in hospitals"", he says it is for NHS Trusts to introduce their own policies. ""Ultimately we are judged on our record,"" he says, ""we want to make the smoke free generation a reality."" ""Tobacco control is a key priority for us."" Tobacco Control Plan House of CommonsParliament DUP MP Jim Shannon says that there is a serious problem in Northern Ireland of illegal tobacco smuggling involving paramilitaries, and HMRC needs to do more to combat this. He encourages English HMRC officers to talk more with their opposite numbers in Northern Ireland and Scotlandto improve approaches. ""We can look at these things collectively and establish a policy that will help us all."" The EU has issued a 16-page document outlining the preparations for deal or no deal. Tobacco Control Plan House of CommonsParliament The chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Smoking, Bob Blackman, says there is definitely a case for further tobacco control measures. ""The industry has money to pay for the measures that we need to control tobacco, to mitigate the harm that is causes."" ""Let us make the manufacturers pay,"" he says. He says there is a need for ""mass media campaigns"" to shock people into realising how dangerous smoking is for people's health. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Guto Bebb warned the Tories could end up handing power to Jeremy Corbyn A Welsh Conservative MP has said he had no choice but to resign over Theresa May's concessions to Brexiteers. Guto Bebbresigned as minister for defence procurementto vote against the government on amendments it accepted to its Brexit Customs Bill on Monday. He told BBC Wales the ""wrecking amendments"" had undermined Mrs May's position in negotiations with Brussels. Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns said he was ""very sorry"" the Aberconwy MP felt he had to quit over the issue. Government scrapes through EU customs votes Airbus Brexit remarks criticised Brexit: All you need to know The government avoided defeat by three votes on two amendments, and was accused of ""caving in"" to the Tory party's Eurosceptic MPs. Downing Street accepted four amendments altogether, saying they were ""consistent"" with the government's position on how it wanted to trade with the EU in years to come. On Tuesday, Mr Bebb said Brexiteer's ""wrecking amendments"" had been put forward ""with a simple intention of damaging the Chequers agreement"", the blueprint for future relations with the EU the prime minister agreed with cabinet earlier this month. ""When the government were not willing to compromise on this issue I felt that I had no choice because ultimately I wanted to send the prime minister to talk to the European Commission, to negotiate with the European Commission, from a position of strength with the party united behind her,"" he said. ""I think the ERG [pro-Brexit Conservative European Research Group] amendments yesterday have absolutely undermined the negotiating position that the prime minister had and I felt duty bound to try and vote to highlight the fact that the Conservative Party should be led by the prime minister not by the leadership of the ERG group. ""I'm disappointed that that point wasn't made last night with a victory in the vote in question."" Alun Cairns and Guto Bebb had served together in the Wales Office MPs backed an amendment preventing the UK collecting taxes on behalf of the EU unless the rest of the EU does the same for the UK. Applying EU tariffs to products destined for the EU is part of Mrs May's plan to avoid friction at UK borders after Brexit. Another amendment, to ensure the UK is out of the EU's VAT regime, was backed by 303 to 300. Mr Bebb was appointed minister for defence procurement in January 2018 after serving as parliamentary under secretary of state at the Wales Office and a government whip from March 2016. Following his departure from government, he warned his whole party could go the same way if its divisions continued. ""I think the Conservative Party needs to think very carefully as to what will be the impact on the United Kingdom if we ended up with a Marxist Labour government intent upon some of the policies which are being supported by Jeremy Corbyn and his Labour leadership,"" he said. ""There are some in the party who are more intent on the concept of ideological purity on a Brexit which most people didn't vote for. ""Most people voted to leave the European Union not for a termination of our relationship with the EU."" This video can not be played David Jones said ""a lot more listening"" needed to be done by ministers Mr Bebb had staunchly defended the prime minister amid the turmoil which has followed the Chequers agreement, brandingBoris Johnson's resignation as foreign secretary ""a selfish act""andattacking former Brexit Minister David Jonesfor criticising Mrs May's plan. Earlier on Tuesday Mr Cairns told BBC Radio Wales he was ""going to miss"" Mr Bebb, who had served under him as a junior Wales Office minister. Speaking onGood Morning Wales, he said: ""Guto was an excellent minister and a close colleague and a good friend. ""I'm very sorry that he felt in order to vote last night that he needed to leave the government."" Clwyd West MP David Jones - a former Brexit minister and Welsh secretary who led the Vote Leave campaign in Wales - said the government was right to listen to its Brexiteer critics but believed ""a lot more listening"" needed to be done. Guto Bebb told me he was increasingly concerned about the power of Brexiteers over the prime minister. He believes the government bowed to pressure when it didn't necessarily need to, which leads him to question who actually leads the party now, Theresa May or a hard-core group of Brexit supporters. The government insists that the amendments change nothing, but Mr Bebb told me that was ""nonsense"" and he now had real concerns about Mrs May's ability to negotiate a deal with the European Union. The party's internal feud over Europe is worrying the former minister, who has serious concerns about the party's future if members don't become more pragmatic in their outlook about Brexit.

"With the UK on course to leave the European Union in March next year, the country faces four possible scenarios. The UK and the EU both insist they want as amicable a divorce as possible, with a legal agreement setting out the kind of relationship they will have when the UK is no longer a member of the club. MP quits as minister over Brexit vote Reality Check: What does the Brexit White Paper reveal? Brexit: All you need to know Prime Minister Theresa May wants to keep close ties with the EU in certain areas, such as trade in agricultural products and allowing skilled migrants access to jobs in the UK. She saysher plan,externalwill allow Britain to take back control of its laws, money and borders, just like people voted for in the 2016 EU referendum, while also allowing as ""frictionless"" trade as possible and avoiding a physical border for Northern Ireland. But it has been attacked as an unworkable compromise by people from both the Remain and Leave ends of the debate. The EU may also decide to reject it, but the two sides are still hoping to strike some kind of deal by the autumn and, despite criticism and ministerial resignations, Mrs May believes this is the best option. A clean break with the EU. The UK would fall back on its membership of the World Trade Organization (WTO), the global body governing international trade. UK exports to the EU would be subject to the same customs checks and taxes the EU currently imposes on countries like the United States. Those arguing for this option - the so-called ""hard Brexiteers"" - say it would create a truly independent nation able to strike its own beneficial trade deals around the world. But opponents say it would be catastrophic for British business and have warned about chaos at the borders, higher food prices and shortages in the shops. The UK has formally triggered the mechanism to leave the EU at 23:00 GMT on 29 March, 2019. To reverse that at this late stage would mean a huge loss of political face, and probably require a new prime minister, with the backing of voters in a general election. European Council President Donald Tusk has said he believes Brexit can be halted - but there is some debate about whether the Article 50 process, the two-year legal mechanism taking the UK out of the EU, is reversible. (You can read a fullBBC Reality Check on the debate here.) If the UK did leave and wanted to immediately rejoin, it would need all the other EU member states to agree. A less formal version of staying in the EU would be if the UK strikes a deal that keeps it in the EU's trade arrangements - the customs union and the single market - and agrees to free movement of people and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. This would amount to staying in the EU, Brexiteers argue. The UK government has ruled this out but there have been a number of people calling for a fresh vote - includingJustine Greening. Reality Check: How would the UK hold a second EU referendum? With Parliament apparently split over what kind of Brexit it wants, a referendum on the final deal agreed by Theresa May in Brussels might yet end up being the only way to break the deadlock. Those campaigning for another referendum say voters should get the final say, including the option of staying in. Labour's leadership say a general election should be held rather than another referendum.

"This video can not be played Barack Obama: ""You have to believe in facts"" Barack Obama has used his first high-profile speech since stepping down as US president to take swipes at ""strongman politics"" and politicians' disregard for the facts. His comments are seen as thinly veiled criticism ofthe current US administration's use of what has been described as ""alternative facts"". Here are five key points from his Nelson Mandela lecture, made to the world's media and an audience of some 15,000 people in South Africa's main city, Johannesburg. Obama's speech as it happened ""You have to believe in facts,"" said Mr Obama, ""without facts there is no basis for cooperation. ""If I say this is a podium and you say this is an elephant, it is going to be hard for us to cooperate."" Mr Obama said that he could find common ground with people who disagreed with the Paris accord on climate change - which Donald Trump wants to pull the US out of - if they had an argument based on fact. The term ""alternative facts"" was used by a Trump aide in relation to attendance at his inauguration But, Mr Obama added: ""I can't find common ground if someone says climate change is not happening when almost all the world's scientists say it is. If you start saying it is an elaborate hoax, where do we start?"" Mr Trump has said he thinks climate change is not happening. A moment later, Mr Obama told the audience: ""It used to be if you caught them [politicians] lying, they said: 'Oh man'. Now they just keep on lying."" Barack Obama said striving towards equality ensures a society can draw on the talents and the energy of all of its people. ""Just look at the French football team,"" he said to wild cheers, referring to France's World Cup win days before. ""Not all of those folks looked like Gauls to me, but they are French - they are French."" Fourteen of France's 23-member squad would be eligible to play for African teams It is a ""plain fact"" that racial discrimination still exists in the US and South Africa, Mr Obama said. Analysis by BBC North America reporter Anthony Zurcher Barack Obama offered what some of his supporters will see as not-so-veiled references to his successor in his speech honouring Nelson Mandela's legacy, defending democratic institutions and a free press, and condemning ""strongman politics"" and shameless leaders who ""double down"" when caught lying. The former president also offered a commodity he always seems to have in ready supply - hope. ""Things may go backwards for a while, but ultimately, right makes might,"" Mr Obama said. ""Not the other way around."" It's a riff on the Theodore Parker line he frequently quotes, about the arc of history being long but bending toward justice. If Mr Obama had a message for the world - and particularly for Americans unsure about the course their nation is on - it's that the struggle is real, but the ending is a happy one. There are probably more than a few on the left, however, who wish Mr Obama would give more than a few speeches and carefully worded statements. With mid-term elections that will determine control of Congress just four months away, they want him to step away from the podium and fully join the fight.

Viewpoint: What 'Madiba magic' means to me Barack Obama said the world's elite were out of touch with the lives of the poor. ""In their business dealings, many titans of industry... are increasingly detached from any nation state"" and they ""live lives more and more isolated from ordinary people"", he said. As a result, their decisions to ""shut down a factory"" were seen as simply a ""rational response"" to shareholders' demands. Politicians using ""politics of fear, resentment, retrenchment"" were rising ""at a pace unimaginable just a few years ago,"" Barack Obama warned. Democracy is messy, he said, ""but the efficiency of an autocrat is a false promise"". This video can not be played South African President Cyril Ramaphosa says Mr Obama cannot dance as well as Mandela ""It is time for us to stop paying all of our attention to the world's capitals... and focus on the world's grassroots. That is where democracy comes from,"" he added. Warning against creeping populism and ""strongman politics"", he made the case for liberal democracy, saying that he believed it offered the better future for humanity. ""I believe in Nelson Mandela's vision"" for the world's future, he said, ""I believe that a world governed by such principles is possible"". ""It can achieve more peace and more cooperation in pursuit of a common good,"" he added. ""I believe we have no choice but to move forward... I believe it is based on hard evidence. The fact that the world's most prosperous and successful societies happen to be those which have most closely approximated the liberal progressive ideal that we talk about."" Things may go backwards for a while, but - ultimately - right makes might,"" Mr Obama said. ""Not the other way around."" ""Keep believing. Keep marching. Keep building. Keep raising your voice. Every generation has the opportunity to remake the world,"" Mr Obama said, ending his speech on a positive note. To loud cheers, he called on young people listening to him to get ""fired up"". ""We don't just need one leader... what we badly need is that collective spirit,"" he added. ""Mandela said young people are capable when aroused of bringing down the towers of oppression and raising the banners of freedom,"" he said. ""Now is a good time to be aroused."" Around 15,000 people are reported to have attended this year's Nelson Mandela lecture Barack Obama's speech was part of events to mark 100 years since the birth of former South Africa President Nelson Mandela, who died in 2013 aged 95. Both men were the first black presidents of their countries. Mr Obama has said he was ""one of the countless millions who drew inspiration from Nelson Mandela's life"". Mandela led the fight against white minority rule in South Africa. He was imprisoned for 27 years before he became the country's first democratically elected president in 1994. As a student, Mr Obama called the fight against apartheid ""a struggle that touches each and every one of us"", andencouraged his university to drop its investments in South Africa.,external Since its beginning in 2003, global leaders have used the lecture to speak about issues affecting South Africa, the continent and the world.

"The Conservative MP who attempted to block a ban on upskirting is under fire again - for stopping the Commons being used for a women's conference. Sir Christopher Chope said he would not be intimidated by ""lies"" about him being a ""misogynist"". He said his sole aim was to prevent badly thought-out legislation. And he said he had been ""vindicated"" over his objection to the upskirting bill because the government was now facing calls to make changes to it. ,external'Pants protest' against Commons row MP 'Pants protest' against Commons row MP May 'disappointed' at upskirting law block On Monday evening, Sir Christopher blocked a motion by Conservative MP Mims Davies calling for the Commons chamber to be used for a Women MPs of the World Conference on a day in November when MPs were not sitting. The plan for a Women MPs of the World conference is backed by Commons leader Andrea Leadsom, but she had decided to allow MPs to have the final say on it. The prime minister's official spokesman said: ""The government is supportive of holding the conference and will seek to find time for it to be debated."" Sir Christopher has tabled an amendment to the motion saying that the conference must be for parliamentarians only - and that they must hold a debate while using the chamber. He told BBC News the Commons chamber was the ""fulcrum"" of British democracy and should only ever be used by elected parliamentarians. ""Even if you are a member of the House of Lords, you cannot sit on our green benches at any time,"" Sir Christopher told the BBC. The one exception to this rule was the Youth Parliament, he added, which is allowed to use the chamber for debates one day a year because its members are elected. He was criticised by shadow women and equalities minister Dawn Butler who said Theresa May needed to ""to call out this sexist behaviour in her own party"". Labour MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle said on Twitter: ""Once with upskirting is foolish but twice might lead to accusations of him being a misogynist!"" Sir Christopher's office door was decorated with underwear after his previous intervention Sir Christopher said claims of misogyny levelled at him were ""all lies"" and he would not be deterred from holding the government to account for ""lazy"" and poorly thought-out laws. ""I have always been keen to ask questions - that is a key part of our democracy,"" he said. He said he had been through a ""torrid period trying to get to the truth"" about the upskirting bill but had now been ""fully vindicated"" because MPs had tabled a string of amendments to the government's bill over fears it will not be effective. The government said it would give top priority to creating a new criminal offence of taking a photograph underneath a person's skirt after Sir Christopher blocked a bill by Lib Dem MP Wera Hobhouse. Maria Miller, chairwoman of the Women and Equalities Committee, last weekwarned against rushing the Voyeurism (Offences) (No. 2) Bill,externalthrough parliament because ""we could end up with a piece of legislation that is not doing what the government set out for it to do, which is to close a loophole in the law"". ""What really concerns me is that perpetrators could easily plead that they were taking images not for sexual gratification, but anonymously for sale to a third party,"" she told MPs. ""That could actually give perpetrators a very big loophole to climb through.""

"This video can not be played Widow Jemma Neilson said nobody should have to tell an eight-year-old that 'daddy is never coming home' A tank explosion which killed two British Army soldiers was caused by a design flaw, a coroner has found. Royal Tank Regiment corporals Matthew Hatfield, 27, and Darren Neilson, 31, died during a live firing exercise at Castlemartin Range in Pembrokeshire. A seal stopping explosive gases escaping into a tank crew's turret was not in place before the lethal blast. The widow of one of those killed said ""lessons must be learned from the deadly incident"". Cpl Neilson, 31, from Preston, Lancashire, was the tank commander and was thrown from the turret in the blast on 14 June 2017. Cpl Hatfield, 27, and a father of one, from Amesbury, Wiltshire, was loading ammunition. Both men were taken to hospital but died of their injuries the following day. Two other soldiers, Warrant Officer Stuart Lawson and Trooper Michael Warren, were also injured but survived. The Castlemartin base covers 2,400 hectares of land on the Pembrokeshire coast The airtight seal, a bolt vent axial (BVA), that would have prevented explosive gases being released into the tank's turret was not in place when the men fired on 14 June 2017. Senior coroner for Birmingham and Solihull Louise Hunt said the ""hazard"" had not been adequately tested by the gun designers or the Ministry of Defence (MoD) in manufacture. The tank chassis and turret is built by BAE Systems, while the gun itself was made by Royal Ordnance. There was no written process to check the presence of the airtight seal and the soldiers were unaware it had been removed on a prior exercise. 'No written consent' for fatal blast tank Castlemartin inquest: Tank blast soldiers 'not showing off' Fatal tank blast 'was first in history' Ms Hunt said: ""The main cause of this incident was the tank being able to fire without the BVA assembly being present. ""During production and manufacture of the gun, this hazard was not adequately considered or investigated and therefore the ability of the gun to fire without the BVA present went undetected."" The inquest also revealed that a second blast in the tank was caused when incorrectly stowed ammunition bags exploded during the incident. The coroner has written to military chiefs and tank designers about the deaths The coroner heard a succession of troopers give evidence that the charges were sometimes stored out of heat-proof storage bins within the turret, including an occasion where one was ""on a soldier's lap"". After the inquest, Cpl Neilson's widow, Jemma Neilson, said health and safety should have been ""world class"" and called for immediate changes by the MoD and Army. She said: ""No soldier should ever be killed in training. ""Lessons must be learned, cultures must change and the MoD must accept failings and implement change immediately. ""An incident of this nature must never happen again."" The coroner has sent a report to the MoD and the gun designers to prevent future deaths. The Army said it had already improved training, weapons drills, and procedures.

The referendum was not legally binding, merely ""advisory,""according to a Supreme Court judgement in December 2016, so it can't be ordered to be re-run by a court - any decision to have a fresh referendum would have to be made by the government and Parliament would have to pass a referendum act. Reality Check: How would the UK hold a second EU referendum? The Electoral Commission has referred Mr Grimes and Mr Halsall to the Metropolitan Police in relation to false declarations of campaign spending, and handed over files ""in relation to whether any persons have committed related offences"" that fall outside the watchdog's remit. Darren Grimes founded youth group BeLeave Vote Leave and the official Remain campaign Britain Stronger in Europe were allowed to spend Â£7m each on campaigning in the run up to the referendum. Vote Leave spent nearly Â£2.7m of its Â£7m budget on the services of a Canadian digital marketing firm, Aggregate IQ. A further Â£675,315 was sent to Aggregate IQ by BeLeave, a group set up by Mr Grimes, then a fashion student at Brighton university. The money came from Vote Leave which has said in the past it was told by the Electoral Commission it was allowed to do this because BeLeave was a separate campaign group. But the Electoral Commission - which is the watchdog overseeing elections in the UK and ensuring that UK laws on spending by political parties are followed - has ruled that the two groups were working together and Mr Grimes had ""wrongly"" reported the spending as his own. This meant that, including this amount, the Electoral Commission says Vote Leave spent Â£7,449,079, breaching its Â£7m spending limit. Darren Grimes is also said to have exceeded the Â£10,000 he was allowed to spend as a non-registered campaigner, the watchdog said. Bob Posner, from the Electoral Commission, said: ""We found substantial evidence that the two groups worked to a common plan, did not declare their joint working and did not adhere to the legal spending limits. These are serious breaches of the laws put in place by Parliament to ensure fairness and transparency at elections and referendums."" He added: ""Vote Leave has resisted our investigation from the start, including contesting our right as the statutory regulator to open the investigation. It has refused to cooperate, refused our requests to put forward a representative for interview, and forced us to use our legal powers to compel it to provide evidence. ""Nevertheless, the evidence we have found is clear and substantial, and can now be seen in our report."" It is impossible to say how overspending by the Vote Leave campaign affected the referendum result. It all went to one marketing firm, which developed highly-targeted Facebook advertising. In a quote since removed from the Aggregate IQ website, Vote Leave campaign director Dominic Cummings said: ""We couldn't have done it without them."" Former Vote Leave activist Shahmir Sanni, who went public with allegations about overspending earlier this year, told BBC Radio 4's The World at One the extra cash spent by BeLeave had affected the referendum outcome - saying such a sum ""can make all the difference"". Anti-Brexit Labour peer Lord Adonis said Vote Leave's overspending ""could have been decisive"" in the 2016 referendum because it was a close result but he did not want to re-run that campaign. Instead, he said ""all of those responsible for this breach of the law"" should be ""barred"" from playing any part in any future referendum, such as the one he is calling for on the final Brexit deal. This video can not be played MPs expressed their anger at Vote Leave Labour is calling for Tory ministers who were key figures in Vote Leave to be referred to the cabinet secretary to determine whether they had broken the ministerial code. In a statement on Twitter, Mr Grimes said it was ""incredible"" that he had been fined Â£20,000 ""on the basis of the wrong box being ticked on an application form"". He said he had been interviewed by the Electoral Commission during two previous investigations and had never been ""provided with particulars"" of the allegation that he had worked on a ""common plan"" with Vote Leave so that he could ""make representations about it"". ""Politicians say they want young people to engage with politics. I was 22 when I got involved in a referendum I felt passionately about. I did nothing wrong,"" he added. ""I have been persecuted for over two years by powerful people for nothing more than engaging in the democratic process and having the temerity to be on the winning side. It has been appalling for my family."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Electoral Commission cleared Vote Leave of breaking spending limits in March last year but re-opened its investigation in October, saying new evidence had come to light from its own investigations, media reports, academics and whistleblowers. Third Vote Leave whistleblower revealed Another pro-Brexit group, Veterans for Britain, was also found to have inaccurately reported a donation it received from Vote Leave and has been fined Â£250. Vote Leave also returned an ""incomplete and inaccurate spending report"", with almost Â£234,501 reported incorrectly, and invoices missing for Â£12,849.99 of spending, the watchdog said. A Vote Leave spokesman said: ""The Electoral Commission's report contains a number of false accusations and incorrect assertions that are wholly inaccurate and do not stand up to scrutiny. ""It is astonishing that nobody from Vote Leave has been interviewed by the commission in the production of this report, nor indeed at any point in the past two years. Yet the commission has interviewed the so-called 'whistleblowers' who have no knowledge of how Vote Leave operated and whose credibility has been seriously called into question. ""Vote Leave has provided evidence to the Electoral Commission proving there was no wrongdoing. And yet despite clear evidence of wrongdoing by the Remain campaign, the commission has chosen to ignore this and refused to launch an investigation. ""All this suggests that the supposedly impartial commission is motivated by a political agenda rather than uncovering the facts. ""The commission has failed to follow due process, and in doing so has based its conclusions on unfounded claims and conspiracy theories. ""We will consider the options available to us, but are confident that these findings will be overturned."" This video can not be played Former Vote Leave chief Matthew Elliott defended his group's actions The Electoral Commission hit back at allegations of political bias, saying: ""We open investigations where the evidence justifies it, irrespective of the political views of the party or campaigner concerned."" It also insisted it had followed ""due process"" and had spent three months and made five attempts to interview Vote Leave representatives. Months into the investigation, ""certain Vote Leave staff members came to us separately and offered to be interviewed"", an Electoral Commission source said, but by that point it had gathered enough evidence to conclude that an offence had occurred. Asked whether it believed the referendum result was still valid, No 10 said the public delivered a ""clear verdict"" which the government was in the process of implementing. But speaking in the Commons, former Tory home secretary Amber Rudd said ministers should not use this to ""obfuscate"" from its duty to protect the electoral system from abuses. And Tory MP Sarah Wollaston, who voted to remain, called for the referendum to be re-run. A separate Brexit campaign, Leave.EU, was fined Â£70,000 in March for failing to declare ""at least"" Â£77,380 it spent on referendum campaigning. Leave.EU chief executive Liz Bilney was referred to the police following the commission's investigation. Leave.EU co-founder Arron Banks called it a ""politically motivated attack"" and said he would take the watchdog to court. Leave.EU, which was fronted by then-UKIP leader Nigel Farage, was only allowed to spend Â£700,000 in the run up to the referendum, after losing out to Vote Leave in the battle to designated the official Leave campaign. The official Remain campaign Britain Stronger in Europe, was fined Â£1,250 in December last year for not providing invoices and for declaring some spending in aggregate rather than individual payments.

"Poundworld has said it will close a further 40 stores, resulting in 531 more job losses. The discount goods retailer, which went into administration in June, said the stores would close on 24 July. Poundworld had already announced plans to close 105 of its 335 stores, having failed to strike a rescue deal. Its administrators, Deloitte, said they were still looking for buyers for all, or parts, of the remaining business. Clare Boardman, joint administrator, said: ""We would like to thank all the employees for their continued support and commitment during this difficult time. We are keeping staff appraised of developments as they happen."" Full list of the latest Poundworld closures The death of a Poundworld What's eating the pound shops? At least two potential rescue deals have failed so far, including one from the chain's founder Chris Edwards, who was offering to buy around half of the stores. Mr Edwards, who founded Poundworld in 1974, was critical of how his offer was received by Deloitte, and said he was ""shocked and surprised"" that he was turned away. In June, Alteri investors, which specialises in buying struggling retailers, also pulled out of takeover talks. Poundworld went bust in early June after struggling with tough competition on the High Street from rivals including Poundland and Poundstretcher. It was also hit by the fall in the value of the pound after the 2016 Brexit referendum, which has pushed up the price of imported goods. Poundworld employed about 5,100 people before it went into administration and around 1,800 redundancies have been announced since then. Deloitte has also made 100 people redundant at Poundworld's head office in Normanton, West Yorkshire.

"This video can not be played Barack Obama: ""You have to believe in facts"" Barack Obama has used his first high-profile speech since stepping down as US president to take swipes at ""strongman politics"" and politicians' disregard for the facts. His comments are seen as thinly veiled criticism ofthe current US administration's use of what has been described as ""alternative facts"". Here are five key points from his Nelson Mandela lecture, made to the world's media and an audience of some 15,000 people in South Africa's main city, Johannesburg. Obama's speech as it happened ""You have to believe in facts,"" said Mr Obama, ""without facts there is no basis for cooperation. ""If I say this is a podium and you say this is an elephant, it is going to be hard for us to cooperate."" Mr Obama said that he could find common ground with people who disagreed with the Paris accord on climate change - which Donald Trump wants to pull the US out of - if they had an argument based on fact. The term ""alternative facts"" was used by a Trump aide in relation to attendance at his inauguration But, Mr Obama added: ""I can't find common ground if someone says climate change is not happening when almost all the world's scientists say it is. If you start saying it is an elaborate hoax, where do we start?"" Mr Trump has said he thinks climate change is not happening. A moment later, Mr Obama told the audience: ""It used to be if you caught them [politicians] lying, they said: 'Oh man'. Now they just keep on lying."" Barack Obama said striving towards equality ensures a society can draw on the talents and the energy of all of its people. ""Just look at the French football team,"" he said to wild cheers, referring to France's World Cup win days before. ""Not all of those folks looked like Gauls to me, but they are French - they are French."" Fourteen of France's 23-member squad would be eligible to play for African teams It is a ""plain fact"" that racial discrimination still exists in the US and South Africa, Mr Obama said. Analysis by BBC North America reporter Anthony Zurcher Barack Obama offered what some of his supporters will see as not-so-veiled references to his successor in his speech honouring Nelson Mandela's legacy, defending democratic institutions and a free press, and condemning ""strongman politics"" and shameless leaders who ""double down"" when caught lying. The former president also offered a commodity he always seems to have in ready supply - hope. ""Things may go backwards for a while, but ultimately, right makes might,"" Mr Obama said. ""Not the other way around."" It's a riff on the Theodore Parker line he frequently quotes, about the arc of history being long but bending toward justice. If Mr Obama had a message for the world - and particularly for Americans unsure about the course their nation is on - it's that the struggle is real, but the ending is a happy one. There are probably more than a few on the left, however, who wish Mr Obama would give more than a few speeches and carefully worded statements. With mid-term elections that will determine control of Congress just four months away, they want him to step away from the podium and fully join the fight. You may also like: Harry and Meghan visit Mandela exhibition Did Obama improve US race relations? Viewpoint: What 'Madiba magic' means to me Barack Obama said the world's elite were out of touch with the lives of the poor. ""In their business dealings, many titans of industry... are increasingly detached from any nation state"" and they ""live lives more and more isolated from ordinary people"", he said. As a result, their decisions to ""shut down a factory"" were seen as simply a ""rational response"" to shareholders' demands. Politicians using ""politics of fear, resentment, retrenchment"" were rising ""at a pace unimaginable just a few years ago,"" Barack Obama warned. Democracy is messy, he said, ""but the efficiency of an autocrat is a false promise"". This video can not be played South African President Cyril Ramaphosa says Mr Obama cannot dance as well as Mandela ""It is time for us to stop paying all of our attention to the world's capitals... and focus on the world's grassroots. That is where democracy comes from,"" he added. Warning against creeping populism and ""strongman politics"", he made the case for liberal democracy, saying that he believed it offered the better future for humanity. ""I believe in Nelson Mandela's vision"" for the world's future, he said, ""I believe that a world governed by such principles is possible"". ""It can achieve more peace and more cooperation in pursuit of a common good,"" he added. ""I believe we have no choice but to move forward... I believe it is based on hard evidence. The fact that the world's most prosperous and successful societies happen to be those which have most closely approximated the liberal progressive ideal that we talk about."" Things may go backwards for a while, but - ultimately - right makes might,"" Mr Obama said. ""Not the other way around."" ""Keep believing. Keep marching. Keep building. Keep raising your voice. Every generation has the opportunity to remake the world,"" Mr Obama said, ending his speech on a positive note. To loud cheers, he called on young people listening to him to get ""fired up"". ""We don't just need one leader... what we badly need is that collective spirit,"" he added. ""Mandela said young people are capable when aroused of bringing down the towers of oppression and raising the banners of freedom,"" he said. ""Now is a good time to be aroused."" Around 15,000 people are reported to have attended this year's Nelson Mandela lecture Barack Obama's speech was part of events to mark 100 years since the birth of former South Africa President Nelson Mandela, who died in 2013 aged 95. Both men were the first black presidents of their countries. Mr Obama has said he was ""one of the countless millions who drew inspiration from Nelson Mandela's life"". Mandela led the fight against white minority rule in South Africa. He was imprisoned for 27 years before he became the country's first democratically elected president in 1994. As a student, Mr Obama called the fight against apartheid ""a struggle that touches each and every one of us"", andencouraged his university to drop its investments in South Africa.,external Since its beginning in 2003, global leaders have used the lecture to speak about issues affecting South Africa, the continent and the world.

"This video can not be played The ways Trump and Putin see eye to eye There has been a barrage of criticism in the US after President Donald Trump defended Russia over claims of interference in the 2016 elections. At a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Finland, Mr Trump contradicted US intelligence agencies, saying Russia had no reason to meddle. The top Republican in Congress, House Speaker Paul Ryan, said Mr Trump must see that ""Russia is not our ally"". The president's own intelligence chief publicly broke with him. Russia is responsible for ""ongoing, pervasive attempts"" to undermine US democracy, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats said in a statement. Mr Putin denied the claim. On Monday the US and Russian presidents held nearly two hours of one-on-one talks without their advisers in the Finnish capital Helsinki .

In a later interview with Fox News, Mr Putin said it was ""ridiculous"" that some people thought Russia could have influenced the US elections. He said US-Russian relations should not be ""held hostage"" to an internal political struggle in America. Mr Putin also dismissed longstanding reports that Russian intelligence may hold compromising material on Mr Trump. The Russian president said that before the election Mr Trump was just a ""rich person"" and ""of no interest for us"".

Analysis by BBC North America reporter Anthony Zurcher With no tangible results from the summit, the two leaders are framing this as the first of many meetings to come.

After a week abroad, Mr Trump on Monday delivered the coup de grace for what has been a highly disruptive week in US foreign affairs. European allies are uneasy. US-Russia relations are uncertain. And the US political world - and even the White House's own communications team - is unsettled. Mr Putin described the Helsinki meeting as ""candid and useful"" while Mr Trump said there had been ""deeply productive dialogue"". Mr Trump said US-Russia relations had ""never been worse"" than before they met, but that had now changed.

"This video can not be played Trump says he ""misspoke"" at Putin summit, but is it too late? Anthony Zurcher explains US President Donald Trump has said he accepts US intelligence agencies' conclusion that Russia interfered in the 2016 election - despite declining to do so just a day ago. He said he had misspoken on Monday and had meant to say he saw no reason why it was not Russia that meddled. The original comments, after he met Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, drew a barrage of criticism. Even some of Mr Trump's allies had urged him to clarify his stance. Your toolkit to help understand the story Trump's 'most serious mistake' In his latest remarks, he added that he had ""full faith and support"" in US intelligence agencies. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is to appear before Congress next week to answer questions on what happened during Mr Trump's two-hour meeting with President Putin on Monday. Analysis by the BBC's Anthony Zurcher in Washington Does Donald Trump believe in ominous metaphors? As he affirmed his support for US intelligence agencies, the lights went to black in the White House conference room. Once order was restored, he said he had been in the dark as to why a storm had swirled around his presidency since his Helsinki summit with Vladimir Putin. It was, he said, because he had misspoken. That is going to be hard for many of the president's critics to swallow, however. Even if he did mean to say, ""I don't see a reason why it wouldn't be Russia"", it is a pretty weak way to confront the head of a nation accused of targeting the heart of American democracy. What is more, the context of the president's comments make a simple slip of the tongue seem less likely. At the very least, the president gave his supporters some material to rally around. The damage, however, has been done. Mr Trump can give as many White House statements as he likes, but on the biggest stage - standing beside the Russian president - he fumbled. All the explanations cannot change that. The controversy centres on a response he gave to a question at a news conference on Monday following the summit with Mr Putin. This is an extract fromthe transcript posted by the White House,external. REPORTER: President Putin denied having anything to do with the election interference in 2016. Every US intelligence agency has concluded that Russia did. My first question for you, sir, is, who do you believe? Schwarzenegger calls Trump a 'wet noodle' 'Double negative' is not not trending TRUMP: My people came to me... they said they think it's Russia.  I have President Putin; he just said it's not Russia. I will say this: I don't see any reason why it would be. Mr Trump said he had reviewed the transcript and realised he needed to clarify. ""In a key sentence in my remarks, I said the word 'would' instead of 'wouldn't,"" he said. ""The sentence should have been: 'I don't see any reason why I wouldn't' or 'why it wouldn't be Russia'. Sort of a double negative."" The US president added: ""I accept our intelligence community's conclusion that Russia's meddling in the 2016 election took place. Could be other people also. A lot of people out there."" This video can not be played The ways Trump and Putin see eye to eye Mr Trump said that the interference had had no impact on the election, in which he defeated Hillary Clinton. However, he did not respond when reporters asked him if he would condemn Mr Putin. During the press conference with President Putin - in the same answer as the transcript above - Mr Trump went on to say: ""President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today. And what he did is an incredible offer; he offered to have the people working on the case come and work with their investigators with respect to the 12 people. I think that's an incredible offer."" On Wednesday,Mr Trump said in a tweet that Russia had ""agreed to help with North Korea"",external, adding that ""the process is moving along"". ""There is no rush, the sanctions remain! Big benefits and exciting future for North Korea at end of process!"" the president wrote. He said that his meeting with Mr Putin was ""positive"" and ""may prove to be, in the long run... a success"". He added that because he ""got along"" with the Russian leader, it ""bothered many haters"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Republicans and Democrats alike were dumbfounded that Mr Trump had sided with Russia over his own intelligence officials after Monday's summit. The US and Russia have been long-term adversaries and remain far apart on major issues. Some lawmakers were also upset that Mr Trump had refused to offer specific criticisms of Russia and Mr Putin, instead saying both countries were responsible for poor relations. Even one of his most loyal Republican supporters, Newt Gingrich, said the comments were the ""most serious mistake of his presidency"". House Republican Mike Turner accused Mr Trump of having damaged American foreign policy by failing to take Russia to task. ""He's given them a pass and is certainly not holding them accountable for what they're doing,"" he added. Even Trump allies shocked by Putin summit How Trump and Putin see eye to eye.

"This video can not be played Barack Obama: ""You have to believe in facts"" Barack Obama has used his first high-profile speech since stepping down as US president to take swipes at ""strongman politics"" and politicians' disregard for the facts. His comments are seen as thinly veiled criticism ofthe current US administration's use of what has been described as ""alternative facts"". Here are five key points from his Nelson Mandela lecture, made to the world's media and an audience of some 15,000 people in South Africa's main city, Johannesburg. Obama's speech as it happened ""You have to believe in facts,"" said Mr Obama, ""without facts there is no basis for cooperation. ""If I say this is a podium and you say this is an elephant, it is going to be hard for us to cooperate."" Mr Obama said that he could find common ground with people who disagreed with the Paris accord on climate change - which Donald Trump wants to pull the US out of - if they had an argument based on fact. The term ""alternative facts"" was used by a Trump aide in relation to attendance at his inauguration But, Mr Obama added: ""I can't find common ground if someone says climate change is not happening when almost all the world's scientists say it is. If you start saying it is an elaborate hoax, where do we start?"" Mr Trump has said he thinks climate change is not happening. A moment later, Mr Obama told the audience: ""It used to be if you caught them [politicians] lying, they said: 'Oh man'. Now they just keep on lying."" Barack Obama said striving towards equality ensures a society can draw on the talents and the energy of all of its people. ""Just look at the French football team,"" he said to wild cheers, referring to France's World Cup win days before. ""Not all of those folks looked like Gauls to me, but they are French - they are French."" Fourteen of France's 23-member squad would be eligible to play for African teams It is a ""plain fact"" that racial discrimination still exists in the US and South Africa, Mr Obama said. Analysis by BBC North America reporter Anthony Zurcher Barack Obama offered what some of his supporters will see as not-so-veiled references to his successor in his speech honouring Nelson Mandela's legacy, defending democratic institutions and a free press, and condemning ""strongman politics"" and shameless leaders who ""double down"" when caught lying. The former president also offered a commodity he always seems to have in ready supply - hope. ""Things may go backwards for a while, but ultimately, right makes might,"" Mr Obama said. ""Not the other way around."" It's a riff on the Theodore Parker line he frequently quotes, about the arc of history being long but bending toward justice. If Mr Obama had a message for the world - and particularly for Americans unsure about the course their nation is on - it's that the struggle is real, but the ending is a happy one. There are probably more than a few on the left, however, who wish Mr Obama would give more than a few speeches and carefully worded statements. With mid-term elections that will determine control of Congress just four months away, they want him to step away from the podium and fully join the fight.

Viewpoint: What 'Madiba magic' means to me Barack Obama said the world's elite were out of touch with the lives of the poor. ""In their business dealings, many titans of industry... are increasingly detached from any nation state"" and they ""live lives more and more isolated from ordinary people"", he said. As a result, their decisions to ""shut down a factory"" were seen as simply a ""rational response"" to shareholders' demands. Politicians using ""politics of fear, resentment, retrenchment"" were rising ""at a pace unimaginable just a few years ago,"" Barack Obama warned. Democracy is messy, he said, ""but the efficiency of an autocrat is a false promise"". This video can not be played South African President Cyril Ramaphosa says Mr Obama cannot dance as well as Mandela ""It is time for us to stop paying all of our attention to the world's capitals... and focus on the world's grassroots. That is where democracy comes from,"" he added. Warning against creeping populism and ""strongman politics"", he made the case for liberal democracy, saying that he believed it offered the better future for humanity. ""I believe in Nelson Mandela's vision"" for the world's future, he said, ""I believe that a world governed by such principles is possible"". ""It can achieve more peace and more cooperation in pursuit of a common good,"" he added. ""I believe we have no choice but to move forward... I believe it is based on hard evidence. The fact that the world's most prosperous and successful societies happen to be those which have most closely approximated the liberal progressive ideal that we talk about."" Things may go backwards for a while, but - ultimately - right makes might,"" Mr Obama said. ""Not the other way around."" ""Keep believing. Keep marching. Keep building. Keep raising your voice. Every generation has the opportunity to remake the world,"" Mr Obama said, ending his speech on a positive note. To loud cheers, he called on young people listening to him to get ""fired up"". ""We don't just need one leader... what we badly need is that collective spirit,"" he added. ""Mandela said young people are capable when aroused of bringing down the towers of oppression and raising the banners of freedom,"" he said. ""Now is a good time to be aroused."" Around 15,000 people are reported to have attended this year's Nelson Mandela lecture Barack Obama's speech was part of events to mark 100 years since the birth of former South Africa President Nelson Mandela, who died in 2013 aged 95. Both men were the first black presidents of their countries. Mr Obama has said he was ""one of the countless millions who drew inspiration from Nelson Mandela's life"". Mandela led the fight against white minority rule in South Africa. He was imprisoned for 27 years before he became the country's first democratically elected president in 1994. As a student, Mr Obama called the fight against apartheid ""a struggle that touches each and every one of us"", andencouraged his university to drop its investments in South Africa.,external Since its beginning in 2003, global leaders have used the lecture to speak about issues affecting South Africa, the continent and the world.

"Stephen Searle was elected to Suffolk County Council in 2013 A former UKIP councillor has been found guilty of murdering his wife, after he had an affair with their son's partner. Stephen Searle, 64, strangled his wife Anne at their home in Stowmarket, Suffolk, on 30 December. The ex-Royal Marine had denied killing Mrs Searle, 62, after she found out about the affair with Anastasia Pomiateeva. He was found guilty by a jury at Ipswich Crown Court and will be sentenced on Wednesday. Judge Mr Justice Green said Searle's ""act of infidelity in one way or another led to this"". It took the jury three-and-a-half hours to find him guilty of murder, after a six-day trial. Anne Searle was found dead at the couple's home on 30 December Searle had previously told a jury his wife had uncovered his affair with Ms Pomiateeva, who is the mother to at least one of their grandchildren, months before she died. He claimed that on the day of her death, his wife of 45 years had attacked him with a knife following an argument and was killed in the struggle that ensued. He had told the court he did not intend to murder her, failed to call an ambulance after the attack and instead ""sat there like a bloody idiot"". But in a 999 call that was played to jurors, Searle could be heard telling police: ""I've just killed my wife."" This video can not be played Murderer made 999 call after killing wife Prosecutor Andrew Jackson said Searle had probably placed his wife in a choke hold he had knowledge of from his military training following ""yet another row"". He also told the court that the discovery of the affair ""would have put considerable strain on the marriage"". A post-mortem examination recorded that Mrs Searle died of compression of the neck. Searle used to be in the Royal Marines and had military training Forensic pathologist Dr Benjamin Swift said she would have lost consciousness after about eight to 15 seconds of pressure to the neck, and death required further sustained pressure for a period of minutes. Days before her death, Mrs Searle had posted a message on Facebook saying: ""Happy Christmas... I hope I will still be here in 2018. We will see."" In a victim impact statement, one of Searle's sons, also called Stephen, said: ""Not only have I lost my mum, but because of what he's done I've lost my dad too."" Det Ch Supt Eamonn Bridger said: ""Anne Searle's death was a tragic crime and our sympathies remain with her family and friends."" Nigel Farage, the former UKIP leader, had met Searle on the campaign trail when he was a councillor Following the verdict, former politician Bill Mountford told BBC Suffolk he still considered Searle ""a friend"", adding ""these things happen"". Mr Mountford, who was leader of UKIP at Suffolk County Council when Searle was a councillor, said: ""I still regard Steve as fundamentally a decent man who has found himself in circumstances beyond his control. ""I'm not condoning it in any way but I was very, very sad to hear of Steve's conviction. ""I'm well aware domestic disputes can get out of hand but I feel equally sorry for both Steve and his now deceased wife.""

When times are tougher, you can't leave. And, when times are better, you don't want to leave."" Simon Jack: How Lloyd Blankfein changed Goldman Sachs He also thanked his wife Laura and their three children, saying: ""It may be hard for some of you to believe, but I'm told that sometimes I'm not the easiest person to live with. Lloyd Blankfein has led Goldman Sachs for 12 years ""I could not have gone through the ups and downs of the last 12 years without their patience, love and constant support."" Mr Blankfein will step down as chief executive on 30 September and will remain as chairman until the end of the year. Following his retirement, Mr Blankfein will be senior chairman of the firm.

The two-week-oldMandarin duckling,externalwas introduced to the public on Monday, but police said they believe it was stolen between 13:00 and 15:00 BST that day. The East Asian species is very valuable and can be sold at a high price, according to the bird sanctuary.

""As a team, we are extremely saddened that someone had decided to take one of our Mandarin ducklings.""

"The government has urged pro-EU Conservative MPs to ""work with us"" as it seeks to avoid a Commons defeat on post-Brexit customs. Several Tories have expressed support for a call for the UK to stay in a customs union if there is no trade agreement by 21 January 2019. The government says joining a customs union would prevent it from striking trade deals with other countries. MPs have started voting on suggested changes to the Trade Bill. The government has already lost one vote, with MPs backing an amendment that would keep the UK in the European medicines regulatory network. MPs are now voting on the customs union amendment tabled by pro-EU Stephen Hammond. Live: MPs debate Trade Bill At-a-glance: The UK's four Brexit options I had no choice but to quit, says Bebb Cable Brexit vote absence 'unfortunate' Mr Hammond said his amendment was ""exactly in line"" with the negotiating position set out by the government last week. It supports the government's aim of negotiating a free trade area for goods but states if this has not happened by 21 January, ministers must change tack and start discussions on joining a customs union. Trying to avoid a rebellion, International Trade Minister George Hollingbery offered to make new changes to the bill when it reaches the House of Lords. ""Let's do this the other way round,"" Mr Hammond replied, urging the government to accept his amendment instead. The motion on joining a customs union is being backed by Labour, making the risk of defeat more likely. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019 but has yet to agree how its final relationship with the bloc will work. The government, which does not have a Commons majority, has been under pressure from MPs on both sides of the Brexit debate. The Trade Bill would create new structures for dealing with trade disputes after Brexit and carry over up to 40 existing EU trade agreements with other countries that the UK wishes to stick with until new deals are struck. The government twice survived by just three votes on Monday after a backlash from pro-European Tories who accused the prime minister of ""caving in"" to the party's Eurosceptic MPs.

"With the UK on course to leave the European Union in March next year, the country faces four possible scenarios. The UK and the EU both insist they want as amicable a divorce as possible, with a legal agreement setting out the kind of relationship they will have when the UK is no longer a member of the club. MP quits as minister over Brexit vote Reality Check: What does the Brexit White Paper reveal? Brexit: All you need to know Prime Minister Theresa May wants to keep close ties with the EU in certain areas, such as trade in agricultural products and allowing skilled migrants access to jobs in the UK. She saysher plan,externalwill allow Britain to take back control of its laws, money and borders, just like people voted for in the 2016 EU referendum, while also allowing as ""frictionless"" trade as possible and avoiding a physical border for Northern Ireland. But it has been attacked as an unworkable compromise by people from both the Remain and Leave ends of the debate. The EU may also decide to reject it, but the two sides are still hoping to strike some kind of deal by the autumn and, despite criticism and ministerial resignations, Mrs May believes this is the best option. A clean break with the EU. The UK would fall back on its membership of the World Trade Organization (WTO), the global body governing international trade. UK exports to the EU would be subject to the same customs checks and taxes the EU currently imposes on countries like the United States. Those arguing for this option - the so-called ""hard Brexiteers"" - say it would create a truly independent nation able to strike its own beneficial trade deals around the world. But opponents say it would be catastrophic for British business and have warned about chaos at the borders, higher food prices and shortages in the shops. The UK has formally triggered the mechanism to leave the EU at 23:00 GMT on 29 March, 2019. To reverse that at this late stage would mean a huge loss of political face, and probably require a new prime minister, with the backing of voters in a general election. European Council President Donald Tusk has said he believes Brexit can be halted - but there is some debate about whether the Article 50 process, the two-year legal mechanism taking the UK out of the EU, is reversible. (You can read a fullBBC Reality Check on the debate here.) If the UK did leave and wanted to immediately rejoin, it would need all the other EU member states to agree. A less formal version of staying in the EU would be if the UK strikes a deal that keeps it in the EU's trade arrangements - the customs union and the single market - and agrees to free movement of people and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. This would amount to staying in the EU, Brexiteers argue. The UK government has ruled this out but there have been a number of people calling for a fresh vote - includingJustine Greening. Reality Check: How would the UK hold a second EU referendum? With Parliament apparently split over what kind of Brexit it wants, a referendum on the final deal agreed by Theresa May in Brussels might yet end up being the only way to break the deadlock. Those campaigning for another referendum say voters should get the final say, including the option of staying in. Labour's leadership say a general election should be held rather than another referendum.

"Remain campaigners suffered a defeat in last year's EU referendum More clarity is needed in rules aimed at stopping campaigners bypassing spending limits during a referendum, the Electoral Commission says. It said campaigners should have to provide more information to show they were not using multiple groups to avoid hitting spending limits. The watchdog says it will ""review"" new claims that the rules were breached by the EU Remain campaign last year. Britain Stronger in Europe said it had always complied with the rules. Electoral Commission reopens probe into Vote Leave Momentum spending investigated The Electoral Commission is already formally investigating the Leave campaign. Now the Guido Fawkes websiteis calling for,externala similar probe into the other side. It used information published by the commission to suggest that ""co-ordinated"" spending had been spread between various Remain-backing groups which were set up in the run-up to the referendum. More than Â£1m was donated to these new campaigns, it says. In response, a Britain Stronger in Europe spokesman said it had ""always complied fully with Electoral Commission rules on working together and included any instances of it happening in our return to the Electoral Commission"". The commission said: ""We consider and assess possible breaches of the rules consistent with our published enforcement policy and will review the Guido Fawkes articles before deciding whether any action is required."" The key question is whether the different groups were ""working together"" with the official Remain campaign on a ""coordinated plan or arrangement"". If they were, their spending would count towards its Â£7m spending limit. The commission has previously said it might be difficult for campaigners to know whether this rule applies. For example, they are able to ""liaise and discuss campaigning approaches"" but not to spend money on joint advertising campaigns. The commission called on the government to provide legal clarification of what represents ""joint spending"". It also said campaigners should have to specify who they worked with and how much they each spent on their spending returns. There have already been several investigations into the way campaign money was spent during the EU referendum, which Leave won in June 2016. Last month the Electoral Commission said it would reopen a probe into more than Â£600,000 spent by a campaign run by university student Darren Grimes, days ahead of the vote.

And chief whip Alistair Carmichael said he had expected the vote to be ""lost by hundreds"".

"This video can not be played Disabled comedian Tanyalee Davis 'humiliated' on train A comedian has hit out at a train operator after she was ""harassed and humiliated"" for using a disabled space for her mobility scooter. Tanyalee Davis said a guard on a Great Western Railway (GWR) service threatened to call the police if she did not leave the space. Ms Davis said the guard then made an announcement that she was ""causing problems"" which had delayed the train. GWR said staff who saw the video were ""collectively horrified"". Canadian-born Ms Davis, 47, who has a form of dwarfism, was travelling on the 11:00 service from Plymouth to London on Sunday with her partner, Kevin Bolden, who filmed the incident on a mobile phone. She was told to move from the unreserved space after a young mother asked to use it for a pram. Ms Davis, who lives in Norwich, said she felt ""personally and publicly humiliated"" after the guard threatened to call the police. ""He made an announcement... saying that it was 'the woman with the mobility scooter' that was causing problems and that the train would be delayed indefinitely,"" she said. ""It was humiliating and I cried for most of the journey home,"" she said.

"Water levels are low at Wayoh Reservoir near Bolton Millions of people will be affected by the first hosepipe ban of the summer in England. United Utilities (UU) said a temporary ban affecting seven million people in the north-west of England from 5 August would ""safeguard essential supplies"". It said reservoir levels were already low and hot weather was forecast for the rest of July. Other water companies across England said they had adequate supplies and had no plans to impose similar bans. Carlisle and north Eden Valley are exempt from the ban as they receive water from local sources - not the network which serves the rest of the region - and have not been as badly affected by the lack of rainfall, the firm said. Eastern parts of Cheshire are affected, but Chester and West Cheshire are not as they are covered by Severn Trent Water. This video can not be played Millions will be affected by the hosepipe ban Earlier this month UU, which supplies about 3.2 million properties, said it wasmoving water from Wales to boost depleted suppliesacross north-west England. A hosepipe ban was introduced in Northern Irelandat the end of June. People on the Isles of Scilly have also been asked to stop using hosepipes and sprinklers, and to keep ""water usage to an absolute minimum"". The Council of the Isles of Scilly said St Mary's and Bryher's groundwater supply was ""critically low"", and without it the authority would not be able to meet the islands' demand for water. Martin Padley, from UU, said the ""temporary use ban"" came during what was believed to be the longest heatwave since 1976. He said: ""Despite some recent rainfall, reservoir levels are still lower than we would expect at this time of year and, with forecasters predicting a return to hot dry weather for the rest of July, we will need to impose some temporary restrictions on customers. ""Unless we get a period of sustained rainfall before 5 August these restrictions will help us safeguard essential water supplies for longer."" Reality Check: Do hosepipe bans work? What are the effects of a heatwave? How to keep your plants alive in a heatwave The firm said the ban was alongside its other efforts to maintain essential supplies, including maximising water abstraction from ground water supplies; moving water around its regional integrated network of pipes; and running a campaign to encourage customers to use water wisely. UU added it had the power to impose fines of up to Â£1,000 for people who flouted the new restriction. Allotment owners have criticised the ban, claiming they should be excluded. UU has told the BBC allotment owners growing produce for their own consumption are banned from using hosepipes while those who grow fruit and vegetables commercially are exempt. Aimie Ellis says there should be exemptions for allotments Andy Percival, of the Blackpool Federation of Allotments Associations, said the restrictions would have a ""massive impact... putting all their hard work at risk"". He said: ""A lot of produce will fail or be destroyedâ¦ and there is no way of saving crops. ""A lot of retired people, young families or those on low incomes use allotments to supplement their incomes and eat fresh fruit and veg."" Aimie Ellis, who has an allotment in Lawson Road, Blackpool added: ""It would be a shame to see all the year's hard work ruined on account of this ban."" Janette Woodward, from Middlewich, Cheshire, said: ""I don't think it is necessary for it. ""If we all look after water properly, don't waste it, put a bowl underneath your tap if you have got a [dripping] tap and use all that."" Although water companies in other regions of England urged customers to continue to be ""water wise"" in the hot weather, they said they had no plans to impose similar bans. Janette Woodward from Middlewich says the ban is not necessary Jim Ratcliffe, drought manager for the Environment Agency, said the ban was ""a responsible measure"" that will help ""balance the need of people through public water supplies, whilst protecting the sensitive natural environment"". But people in the region questioned the decision on social media, asking why it was necessary and highlighting the water company's profits. Shaun Austin tweeted to the company that the ban ""will reduce water usage by 5-10%"" but ""fixing leaks will reduce water usage by over 20%"". Allow Twitter content?

Bosses of England's nine privatised water companies banked Â£58m in pay and benefits over the past five years, according to research by the GMB union published in June. Privatised water firms in England typically lose between 20% and 22% of supply due to leakage, according to figures from Ofwat, the water industry regulator. Professor David Hall, from the University of Greenwich and an expert on the water industry, said privatised water firms had an incentive not to fix too many leaks as the cost of work would bite into profits and become uneconomic. Water companies in other regions are still urging customers to continue to be ""water wise"" ""They can't recoup the cost of making reductions in leakage levels except by reducing profits, that's not what they want to do,"" he said. ""If the leakage levels were not so high, the daily volume of water delivered would be higher, therefore we would reach the point of hosepipe bans much later. ""Any restriction on water use is a restriction on people's quality of life."" United Utilities' own drought plan says its ""minimum level of service""permits bans no more than once in 20 years, on average,external. It last imposed a ban in 2010 and the current ban will be the third in the company's 23-year history. Last year, the water regulator handed the company an Â£8m ""underperformance"" penalty. Hosepipes or sprinklers for watering private gardens and washing private cars are banned Watering private gardens with a watering can and washing vehicles using a bucket and sponge, which uses a fraction of the amount of water a hosepipe or sprinkler uses, are permitted According to UU, a hosepipe uses 540 litres an hour, as much as an average family-of-four would use in one day, while a sprinkler left running overnight uses as much water as a family-of-four would use in one week The ban can reduce water usage by 5-10%, according to research by United Kingdom Water Industry Research, which would amount to more than 100 million litres per day in the North West Unlike many other areas of the UK, the North West's water supply relies heavily on open water sources (reservoirs), rather than large reserves of ground water from boreholes. And it has experienced some the country's most prolonged dry periods this year. It has been the driest June in the North West and north Wales since 1976,according to Met Office data,external. Dr Neil Macdonald, an expert in water management from the University of Liverpool, said much higher temperatures and ""half the region's normal rainfall in the past two months"" had resulted in high demand and led to a considerable depletion in resources. ""You just have to look around to see everyone using sprinklers"", he said. In 2016-17, United Utilities was one of five companies in England and Wales losing more water than the national average of 121 litres per property per day from leakage. It is losing about 25% through leakage but has made an improvement on the previous year, with leaks down 2.8%. United Utilities lost 439.2 mega litres (439.2 million litres) per day. Per property that works out at 133.4 litres every day. That's more than one-and-a-half bath tubs (a standard bath tub is 80 litres) for every property, every day, lost in the United Utilities area. As of 8 July 2018 United Utilities reservoirs were about two-thirds full (67.1%), down from 84.1% last year. The average through the year is about 81.7% full. There are a range of exemptions to the ban, including for: Blue Badge holders and customers on the company's Priority Services Register Health and safety reasons and medical treatment Watering grass on some parts of sports recreation grounds Filling or maintaining a domestic fish-pond - or an ornamental fountain feeding such a fish-pond Source:United Utilities,external What does the hosepipe ban mean for you?

"Members of Parliament will not vote on whether to start their summer recess this Thursday, despite the government tabling a motion to do so. A motion to bring forward the summer break by five days was not moved when called by Speaker John Bercow on Tuesday, meaning no vote will happen. It had been tabled amid debates on the prime minister's Brexit plans. Tory MP Nicolas Soames said he was glad the ""idiotic proposal,external"" had been dropped. The government could have been defeated, as a number of Conservative backbenchers were against the motion, as well as Labour and the SNP. Speaking in the Commons, Mr Bercow said his ""strong sense"" was that ""the status quo applies"" and that Parliament would sit next Monday and Tuesday ""as had always been the intention"". ""We were always expecting to sit until next Tuesday, that's what our electors would have expected,"" he added.

"Stephen Searle was elected to Suffolk County Council in 2013 A former UKIP councillor has been found guilty of murdering his wife, after he had an affair with their son's partner. Stephen Searle, 64, strangled his wife Anne at their home in Stowmarket, Suffolk, on 30 December. The ex-Royal Marine had denied killing Mrs Searle, 62, after she found out about the affair with Anastasia Pomiateeva. He was found guilty by a jury at Ipswich Crown Court and will be sentenced on Wednesday. Judge Mr Justice Green said Searle's ""act of infidelity in one way or another led to this"". It took the jury three-and-a-half hours to find him guilty of murder, after a six-day trial. Anne Searle was found dead at the couple's home on 30 December Searle had previously told a jury his wife had uncovered his affair with Ms Pomiateeva, who is the mother to at least one of their grandchildren, months before she died. He claimed that on the day of her death, his wife of 45 years had attacked him with a knife following an argument and was killed in the struggle that ensued. He had told the court he did not intend to murder her, failed to call an ambulance after the attack and instead ""sat there like a bloody idiot"". But in a 999 call that was played to jurors, Searle could be heard telling police: ""I've just killed my wife."" This video can not be played Murderer made 999 call after killing wife Prosecutor Andrew Jackson said Searle had probably placed his wife in a choke hold he had knowledge of from his military training following ""yet another row"". He also told the court that the discovery of the affair ""would have put considerable strain on the marriage"". A post-mortem examination recorded that Mrs Searle died of compression of the neck. Searle used to be in the Royal Marines and had military training Forensic pathologist Dr Benjamin Swift said she would have lost consciousness after about eight to 15 seconds of pressure to the neck, and death required further sustained pressure for a period of minutes. Days before her death, Mrs Searle had posted a message on Facebook saying: ""Happy Christmas... I hope I will still be here in 2018. We will see."" In a victim impact statement, one of Searle's sons, also called Stephen, said: ""Not only have I lost my mum, but because of what he's done I've lost my dad too."" Det Ch Supt Eamonn Bridger said: ""Anne Searle's death was a tragic crime and our sympathies remain with her family and friends."" Nigel Farage, the former UKIP leader, had met Searle on the campaign trail when he was a councillor Following the verdict, former politician Bill Mountford told BBC Suffolk he still considered Searle ""a friend"", adding ""these things happen"". Mr Mountford, who was leader of UKIP at Suffolk County Council when Searle was a councillor, said: ""I still regard Steve as fundamentally a decent man who has found himself in circumstances beyond his control. ""I'm not condoning it in any way but I was very, very sad to hear of Steve's conviction.

"A transgender woman who worked as a van driver in the gig economy is bringing a discrimination claim against courier company Gnewt Cargo. Hayley, formerly Stanley, from London, claims she was bullied and harassed on the basis of her gender reassignment. The debate around employment rights in the gig economy usually focuses on monetary benefits like holiday pay. London-based Gnewt Cargo says it ended its relationship with Hayley after she deliberately damaged a roller door. The so-called gig economy is characterised by short-term and zero-hours contracts, and freelance work rather than permanent jobs. What is the gig economy? Gig economy: Workers rights to be enforced Fresh call for crackdown on gig economy This video can not be played Hayley described the harassment to BBC Legal Correspondent Clive Coleman Hayley's case is thought to be the first to test LGBT+ rights and discrimination in the gig economy. This case focuses on dignity at work - a critical issue for those working for both established businesses and new gig economy companies. In her flat in Bermondsey, south-east London, Hayley - whose full name is Stanley Hayley but she has adopted her surname as her first name - takes me through her preparations for her day's work as a van driver. She puts on eyeliner, mascara and nail polish, and picks a pair of flat shoes from a sparkling range, which includes diamante wedges and six-inch heels. It had been a daily routine for 12 years and only stopped in January when she was dismissed by Gnewt Cargo. Hayley is not the kind of person most people would envisage driving a commercial van. ""Generally people are fine with me,"" she says. ""They are more interested than anything. You get a few looks.  It can start a conversation. ""Sometimes you can even get a few phone numbers,"" she jokes. Until January, Hayley worked at Gnewt Cargo where her duties were to load parcels onto her van and deliver them across central London. The company classed her as an independent contractor running her own business. She disputes that classification, arguing that she was either a ""worker"" or ""employee"" and so was entitled to the rights and benefits they receive. Hayley worked at Gnewt Cargo until January 2018 She also claims she encountered problems while working for the company. ""They would constantly leave things in my bay where I would load up in the morning,"" she says. ""One time I had 70 boxes I had to physically move by hand out of my bay before I could start work. ""It just used to get me down.  It upset me.  Sometimes when workers would come in they'd point and laugh and snigger. ""The front wheel of my bike was loosened and I came off it going home. ""You complain about it and they just ignore it.  You just start to feel helpless."" Hayley was dismissed when Gnewt Cargo alleged that she had deliberately damaged a roller shutter, which she denies. She is now bringing a discrimination claim for bullying and harassment, based on her gender reassignment. To do that she has to establish that she was a ""worker"" or an ""employee"", and not an independent contractor running her own courier business. Earlier this year, a survey for the government suggested that in the past 12 months 4.4% of the population of Great Britain, amounting to 2.8 million people, had worked in the gig economy. Companies argue that it gives those working flexibility, but it also means they receive far less in the way of rights and benefits than those classed as ""workers"" or ""employees"". Unions and some of those working in the gig economy argue that people are being bogusly classified as independent contractors by companies that want to save on the payment of benefits and deny rights. In a string of recent legal cases different groups, including Uber drivers, plumbers and bicycle couriers, have been recognised as ""workers"" by the courts and tribunals. Plumber wins workers' rights battle Bike courier wins employment rights case Uber loses court appeal over drivers' rights So far, the debate on the status of those working in gig jobs has focused on the monetary rights to benefits such as holiday pay, pension and the national minimum wage. However, the other thing denied to those who are bogusly classified as independent contractors is protection against discrimination. Without that, employers have free rein to treat women, ethnic and other minorities less fairly. Hayley's case is being supported by the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain. Its general secretary, Jason Moyer-Lee, says the reason the union has to bring cases like this ""is that the government is not enforcing the law"". He said: ""It should be protecting those working in the so-called gig economy by ensuring they are correctly classified and receiving the rights and benefits they deserve."" In a statement Gnewt Cargo told the BBC: ""We ended the relationship with Ms Stanley Hayley after an incident, captured on CCTV, in which she purposefully damaged the main roller shutter door of our premises by ramming it with a loaded pallet truck. ""The decision to terminate her contract was purely due to this incident. ""Any other self-employed contractor would have been treated in the same way."" For Hayley, the case is a point of principle. ""It's wrong,"" she says. ""If you are being discriminated against in any form, you should be able to bring some sort of justice to bear on these people. ""They can't get away with treating people like they are commodities."" Last year a tribunal ruled taxi-hailing app firm Uber should treat its drivers as workers Employeesbenefit from the highest level of employment protection. There must be a contract between the employee and employer requiring the employee to carry out duties personally, meaning they cannot send someone else to carry out their work. The employee must also be under the control of the employer in terms of hours, working practices and workplace rules, and be sufficiently integrated into the workplace. Rights and benefits include holiday pay, national minimum wage, rest breaks, discrimination protection, whistleblowing, deduction from wages, pension contribution from an employer under auto-enrolment, a written contract of employment, unfair dismissal protection, redundancy payment, statutory minimum notice pay, maternity/paternity pay, paid time off for antenatal appointments and a right to request flexible working. Workershold an intermediate position between employees and independent contractors. A sub-set of the self-employed, they do their own taxes and tend to work flexibly. However, they are contracted to work personally and they carry out their work as part of someone else's business, rather than their own. For this reason they are entitled to most, but not all, of the employment rights that employees have. Rights and benefits include holiday pay, national minimum wage, rest breaks, discrimination protection, whistleblowing, deduction from wages and pension contribution from employer under auto-enrolment. Independent contractorshave the least legal protection. There will be a contract but there is no requirement that the independent contractor carries out the service personally. Independent contractors are sole traders, freelancers or professionals - in business on their own account and contracting with clients or customers. They have no boss or employer and for this reason have no employment rights. Plumber wins workers' rights battle What is the 'gig' economy?

"Parents need to be confident the toys they buy will not harm their children, Which? said Some children's slime toys contain potentially unsafe levels of a chemical which can cause vomiting and impair fertility, according to Which?. An investigation by the consumer group into 11 popular slime products found eight contained higher than recommended levels of a chemical called boron. One product had more than four times the EU safety limit, the tests found. Which? is advising parents to ""approach slime with caution"" and said retailers and the government must do more. It also urged parents to be careful when choosing to make ""homemade slime"", adding that some ingredients used to make slime - such as some contact lens solutions - contain borax, which is made up of boron. Slime became one of 2017's biggest crazes, with millions of people sharing pictures on Instagram and watching DIY slime-making videos on YouTube. The slime crafter with 850,000 fans on Instagram How slime turned around the fate of a glue factory Slime takes over at the toy fair Inside the highly charged scooter craze Which? tested some of the popular slime products on sale for the chemical boron, an ingredient which is often used to make the products sticky. Excessive levels of boron can cause irritation, diarrhoea, vomiting and cramps, it said. High levels may also impair fertility or cause harm to an unborn child in pregnancy, according to the European Commission. Eight out of the 11 slime products tested contained boron levels which exceeded the European Union safety limit of 300mg/kg. Which? warned parents that many slimes have minimal safety labelling and some are even marked with a CE, suggesting they are safe - despite boron levels being above the EU safety limit. Liquid or sticky toys should contain no more than 300mg/kg of boron, according to an EU safety directive The eight slime toys which did not meet the EU safety directive were all purchased on Amazon, Which? said. Amazon has removed the products identified from its website. In a statement, the web giant said all sellers ""must follow our selling guidelines and those who don't will be subject to action including potential removal of their account"". Which? said anyone who owns any of the slimes which failed the test should be able to return it to the retailer and get a refund. The highest level of boron was Toysmith Jupiter Juice which had 1,400mg/kg of boron - more than four times the permitted level. CCINEE Pink Fluffy Slime was found to contain 1,000mg/kg and Cosoro Dodolu Crystal Slime Magic Clay was tested to have 980mg/kg, Which? said. Slime bought from both The Works and Smyths were tested to be within the safety limit. One product purchased on Amazon, Hulk Green Halloween Slime, met the standard. Eve Squires's daughter Tilly was given slime for her birthday Eve Squires's daughter Tilly, 10, was given slime as a birthday gift and opened it last Wednesday. But on the Thursday, she was sent home from school after being sick in the classroom, having also experienced stomach cramps and a high temperature. Eve, from Wimborne, Dorset, said: ""It didn't present like a normal fever because she wasn't pale and was very much normal self between vomiting. She also still had an appetite. As a mum of four, I've dealt with a lot of bugs. ""Interestingly Fin, her eight-year-old brother, complained of stomach cramps on Monday and is off school today. Fin has had less time playing with the slime kit because it is Tilly's favourite present. ""They're the only two children to play with the slime and my other two children are not unwell."" But she adds: ""It could be a bug, I don't know."" Nikki Stopford, director of research and publishing at Which?, called for ""fundamental changes"" and said: ""Manufacturers must stop making unsafe products and the government and retailers simply have to do a far better job of getting anything identified as a risk off the shelves and out of people's homes."" A Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy spokesman said: ""The government's top priority is to keep people safe, which is why goods being sold in the UK must meet some of the strictest safety laws in the world. ""The evidence provided by Which? will be considered by the Office for Product Safety and Standards and [it can] take any appropriate action."" The British Toy and Hobby Association (BTHA) spokeswoman Natasha Crookes said: ""There are a large number of substances that are restricted from being used in toys for safety reasons. ""Borax is one of those and it is worrying to see so many failing safety tests. Our advice would be to look for reputable toy makers and retailers. ""Members of the BTHA can be found on our website and when looking for toy retailers, try to visit retailers you recognise or look for the name behind the online brand - look at the reviews of sellers, do they have a track record in selling toys and if something looks too good to be true (particularly on price), it probably is."" None of the slime toys that failed to meet the EU safety directive was made by BTHA members, she added. Inside the highly charged scooter craze Slime takes over at the toy fair.

"Plant roots were ground to add to the bread Scientists have discovered the earliest known evidence of bread-making, from a 14,000-year-old dig site. The bake would have looked like a flatbread and tasted a bit like today's multi-grain varieties, they say. Our ancestors may have used the bread as a wrap for roasted meat. Thus, as well as being the oldest bread, it may also have been the oldest sandwich. The find, from the Black Desert in Jordan, pushes back the first evidence for bread by more than 5,000 years. The stone age bread-makers took flour made from wild wheat and barley, mixed it with the pulverised roots of plants, added water, and then baked it. ""This is the earliest evidence we have for what we could really call a cuisine, in that it's a mixed food product,""  Prof Dorian Fuller of University College London told BBC News. ""They've got flatbreads, and they've got roasted gazelle and so forth, and that's something they are then using to make a meal."" Ali Shakaiteer and Dr Amaia Arranz-Otaegui sampling cereals in the area where the bread was discovered Bread has long been part of our staple diet. But little is known about the origins of bread-making. Until now, the oldest evidence of bread came from Turkey; those finds are 9,000 years old. Scientists uncovered two buildings, each containing a large circular stone fireplace within which charred bread crumbs were found. Iceman's last meal was high fat feast Why we may soon have no bananas (again) Separating plant remains from excavated soil Analysed under the microscope, the bread samples showed tell-tale signs of grinding, sieving and kneading. Dr Amaia Arranz-Otaegui of the University of Copenhagen, who discovered the remains of the bread, said it was the last thing they expected to find at the site. ""Bread is a powerful link between our past and present food cultures,"" she said. ""It connects us with our prehistoric ancestors."" The bread would have been made in several stages, including ""grinding cereals and club-rush tubers to obtain fine flour, mixing of flour with water to produce dough, and baking the dough in the hot ashes of a fireplace or in a hot flat-stone"", she explained. Make flour from wild wheat and wild barley Pound tubers (roots) of wild plants that grow in water (sedges or club- or bull-rushes) to a dry pulp Mix together with water to make a batter or dough Bake on hot stones around a fire. The people living in the area at the time were hunter-gatherers. They would have hunted gazelle and trapped smaller animals such as hares and birds. They also foraged for plant foods such as nuts, fruits and wild cereals. The researchers think the bread was made when people gathered together for a celebration or feast. This happened before the advent of farming, when people started growing cereal crops and keeping animals. The fireplace where the bread was found at an archaeological site known as Shubayqa 1 This raises the intriguing possibility that growing cereals for bread may have been the driving force behind farming. ""The significance of this bread is that it shows investment of extra effort into making food that has mixed ingredients,"" said Prof Fuller. ""So, making some sort of a recipe, and that implies that bread played a special role for special occasions. ""That in turn suggests one of the possible motivations as to why people later chose to cultivate and domesticate wheat and barley, because wheat and barley were species that already had a special place in terms of special foods."" The crumbs were 5.7mm long by 4.4mm wide and 2.5mm thick The bread was unleavened and would have resembled a wrap, pitta bread or chapatti. Researchers have tried to reconstruct the recipe in the lab. They say the mixed grains gave the bread a nutty flavour, much like today's multi-grain loaves. Lara GonzÃ¡lez Carretero, from the UCL Institute of Archaeology, who is an expert on prehistoric bread, examined the 24 crumbs under an electron microscope. ""This would be a bread made of wild wheat and wild barley flour, mixed with water, and cooked on a hearth on a fireplace,"" she said. ""There's also the addition of wild tuber flour into it which gives a slightly nutty, bitter flavour to it."" Make flour from domesticated wheat and barley Add ground beans such as chick peas and lentils Mix with water Cook in an oven. The discovery is reported in the journalPNAS,external.

"Parents need to be confident the toys they buy will not harm their children, Which? said Some children's slime toys contain potentially unsafe levels of a chemical which can cause vomiting and impair fertility, according to Which?. An investigation by the consumer group into 11 popular slime products found eight contained higher than recommended levels of a chemical called boron. One product had more than four times the EU safety limit, the tests found. Which? is advising parents to ""approach slime with caution"" and said retailers and the government must do more. It also urged parents to be careful when choosing to make ""homemade slime"", adding that some ingredients used to make slime - such as some contact lens solutions - contain borax, which is made up of boron. Slime became one of 2017's biggest crazes, with millions of people sharing pictures on Instagram and watching DIY slime-making videos on YouTube. The slime crafter with 850,000 fans on Instagram How slime turned around the fate of a glue factory Slime takes over at the toy fair Inside the highly charged scooter craze Which? tested some of the popular slime products on sale for the chemical boron, an ingredient which is often used to make the products sticky. Excessive levels of boron can cause irritation, diarrhoea, vomiting and cramps, it said. High levels may also impair fertility or cause harm to an unborn child in pregnancy, according to the European Commission. Eight out of the 11 slime products tested contained boron levels which exceeded the European Union safety limit of 300mg/kg. Which? warned parents that many slimes have minimal safety labelling and some are even marked with a CE, suggesting they are safe - despite boron levels being above the EU safety limit. Liquid or sticky toys should contain no more than 300mg/kg of boron, according to an EU safety directive The eight slime toys which did not meet the EU safety directive were all purchased on Amazon, Which? said. Amazon has removed the products identified from its website. In a statement, the web giant said all sellers ""must follow our selling guidelines and those who don't will be subject to action including potential removal of their account"". Which? said anyone who owns any of the slimes which failed the test should be able to return it to the retailer and get a refund. The highest level of boron was Toysmith Jupiter Juice which had 1,400mg/kg of boron - more than four times the permitted level. CCINEE Pink Fluffy Slime was found to contain 1,000mg/kg and Cosoro Dodolu Crystal Slime Magic Clay was tested to have 980mg/kg, Which? said. Slime bought from both The Works and Smyths were tested to be within the safety limit. One product purchased on Amazon, Hulk Green Halloween Slime, met the standard. Eve Squires's daughter Tilly was given slime for her birthday Eve Squires's daughter Tilly, 10, was given slime as a birthday gift and opened it last Wednesday. But on the Thursday, she was sent home from school after being sick in the classroom, having also experienced stomach cramps and a high temperature. Eve, from Wimborne, Dorset, said: ""It didn't present like a normal fever because she wasn't pale and was very much normal self between vomiting. She also still had an appetite. As a mum of four, I've dealt with a lot of bugs. ""Interestingly Fin, her eight-year-old brother, complained of stomach cramps on Monday and is off school today. Fin has had less time playing with the slime kit because it is Tilly's favourite present. ""They're the only two children to play with the slime and my other two children are not unwell."" But she adds: ""It could be a bug, I don't know."" Nikki Stopford, director of research and publishing at Which?, called for ""fundamental changes"" and said: ""Manufacturers must stop making unsafe products and the government and retailers simply have to do a far better job of getting anything identified as a risk off the shelves and out of people's homes."" A Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy spokesman said: ""The government's top priority is to keep people safe, which is why goods being sold in the UK must meet some of the strictest safety laws in the world. ""The evidence provided by Which? will be considered by the Office for Product Safety and Standards and [it can] take any appropriate action."" The British Toy and Hobby Association (BTHA) spokeswoman Natasha Crookes said: ""There are a large number of substances that are restricted from being used in toys for safety reasons. ""Borax is one of those and it is worrying to see so many failing safety tests. Our advice would be to look for reputable toy makers and retailers. ""Members of the BTHA can be found on our website and when looking for toy retailers, try to visit retailers you recognise or look for the name behind the online brand - look at the reviews of sellers, do they have a track record in selling toys and if something looks too good to be true (particularly on price), it probably is."" None of the slime toys that failed to meet the EU safety directive was made by BTHA members, she added. Inside the highly charged scooter craze Slime takes over at the toy fair.

"UK wages rose more slowly in the three months to May, despite a further fall in unemployment, official figures show. Wage growth slipped to 2.7% from 2.8% in the three months to May, while unemployment fell by 12,000 to 1.41 million,the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.,external The unemployment rate remained at its joint lowest since 1975 at 4.2%. Some analysts said the slowdown in wage growth could dampen expectations of an interest rate rise next month. Wage growth is one of the key figures that the Bank of England monitors to assess the health of the UK economy. Including bonuses, wage growth fell to 2.5% from 2.6% over the same period, the ONS said. The proportion of people in work rose to a record high of 75.7%. ""We've had yet another record employment rate, while the number of job vacancies is also a new record,"" said ONS statistician Matt Hughes. ""From this, it's clear that the labour market is still growing strongly."" What would an interest rate rise mean for you? Productivity puzzle weighs on UK growth The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee meets on 2 August to decide whether to raise interest rates from their current level of 0.5%. At their last meeting in June, the nine-member MPC was split 6-3, with dissenters calling for a quarter-point rise to 0.75%. Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, called the latest figures on wages and jobs ""mildly disappointing"". ""All in all, these numbers don't alter the economic picture of anaemic growth, a relatively tight labour market and under-control inflation,"" he said. ""Markets are still expecting the Bank of England to raise interest rates in August. But given the increasingly uncertain climate, I think there's a real chance policymakers will sit on their hands and wait for firmer signals the economy is on the right track before risking raising borrowing costs."" However, Andrew Wishart, UK economist at Capital Economics, said he did not think the latest data would deter the Bank from raising rates. ""The recent easing in wage growth looks unlikely to be sustained,"" he said. ""Leading indicators of pay suggest that it is on track to at least meet the Bank of England's forecast for underlying wage growth of 2.75% y/y in Q4. As such, we continue to expect the MPC to vote to raise interest rates next month."" Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), said the latest slowdown in pay growth was ""disappointing"". ""This means that earnings growth in real terms remains in positive territory by just a small margin and so is unlikely to provide much of a boost to consumer spending power,"" he said. ""While we expect that interest rates will rise sooner rather than later, with earnings growth underwhelming, there remains sufficient scope for the MPC to keep a rates hike on hold for longer, particularly given the current economic and political uncertainty."" Tej Parikh, senior economist at the Institute of Directors, said: ""Clamour for an August interest rate rise has been building, but the sluggish pay growth should give pause for thought. The Bank should pay heed to the array of obstacles standing in the way of firms, from the burden of business rates to Brexit uncertainty, when it comes to making its decision.""

"Three of the band members were arrested and convicted for the cathedral performance in 2012 The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has condemned Russia for its handling of two high-profile cases. It said Russia had violated five articles of the human rights convention in its arrest and conviction of Pussy Riot members in 2012. Three women from the activist group were arrested after performing a protest song in a Moscow cathedral. Separately, the ECHR also heavily criticised the investigation into journalist Anna Politkovskaya's murder. Politkovskaya was shot dead in a lift in her block of flats in 2006.Five men were found guilty of her murder in 2014, although it is still not known who commissioned the assassination. The investigative reporter was a vocal critic of Russia's war in Chechnya, and of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Russia had failed to ""take adequate investigatory steps"" to find who commissioned the murder,external, violating Article 2 of the convention, the court said. In 2015,Russia's parliament passed a law allowing it to overrule judgements from the ECHRafter the court ruled against the country for state spying. In the Pussy Riot case, two band members served 16 months in prison after their conviction. Formed in 2011, the group has a varying membership of women who support feminism and agitate against President Putin and the state. On Monday,Russia jailed four members of the band for disrupting the World Cup Finalwith a pitch invasion. One of the pitch invaders high-fived France's MbappÃ© The court ruled that Russia had committed ""multiple violations"" of the European Convention,externalduring the three band members' arrests and sentencing in 2012. The ECHR highlighted the band's ""overcrowded conditions"" when being transported to and from court, and the ""humiliation"" of their exposure in a glass dock during the trial as a breach of Article 3 of the convention. What is the European Court of Human Rights? Pussy Riot's extended detention before trial and lack of access to their lawyers also broke the convention, it added. Moreover, the ECHR said the Russian court twice violated Article 10 - freedom of expression - by banning access to the group's videos online and for condemning the group's conduct and clothing, rather than examining the content of their protest song, during the trial. This video can not be played Judge Marina Syrova: ""These three plus others... plotted together to undermine civil order, motivated by religious hatred"" Russia arrested Maria Alyokhina, Nadezhda Tolokonnikova and Yekaterina Samutsevich in February 2012 after they performed their song Punk Prayer - Virgin Mary, Drive Putin Away in Moscow's Christ the Saviour Cathedral. Guards managed to remove the band after only about a minute of the song. During their conviction,the judge said the three had committed ""hooliganism"" and showed ""a complete lack of respect""for Orthodox believers. All three were sentenced to two years in prison. Ms Alyokhina and Ms Tolokonnikova served 16 months, while Ms Samutsevich was released and had her sentence suspended after seven months in prison. After their release,Pussy Riot publicly disowned Ms Alyokhina and Ms Tolokonnikova, saying the pair had forgotten the ""aspirations and ideals of our group"".

Its spending return also did not include services Leave.EU had received from a US campaign strategy firm, Goddard Gunster, and the group ""inaccurately reported"" three loans totalling Â£6m from Mr Banks - including who had provided them - and did not provide invoices or receipts for 97 separate payments, totalling Â£80,224.

Bob Posner, the Commission's director of political finance and regulation, said spending rules were in place to ensure public confidence in democracy and it was ""disappointing that Leave.EU, a key player in the EU referendum, was unable to abide by these rules"". ""These are serious offences. The level of fine we have imposed has been constrained by the cap on the Commission's fines,"" he added. But Mr Banks told the BBC's Daily Politics that Leave.EU had responded to the Commission with a 20-page report from an independent accountant which, he said, the watchdog had ""ignored completely"". He described the disputed amount as ""an internal management charge which our lawyers have told us wasn't reportable"" and claimed the Commission was staffed by pro-Remainers and the ruling was politically motivated. ""Effectively what they have done is, they started off their investigation with a remit of investigating Cambridge Analytica and dark Russian money - they have found no evidence of any of those things and they have fined us on a technical accounting issue which is heavily in dispute."" Mr Banks said they intended to challenge the finding in court. Electoral Commission chief executive Claire Bassett denied claims of bias made by Mr Banks. She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""The decisions were made by directors of the Electoral Commission, they were made based on robust evidence we had gathered, and indeed you can see that in the 30-page report that we published.""

"The government has urged pro-EU Conservative MPs to ""work with us"" as it seeks to avoid a Commons defeat on post-Brexit customs. Several Tories have expressed support for a call for the UK to stay in a customs union if there is no trade agreement by 21 January 2019. The government says joining a customs union would prevent it from striking trade deals with other countries. MPs have started voting on suggested changes to the Trade Bill. The government has already lost one vote, with MPs backing an amendment that would keep the UK in the European medicines regulatory network. MPs are now voting on the customs union amendment tabled by pro-EU Stephen Hammond. Live: MPs debate Trade Bill At-a-glance: The UK's four Brexit options I had no choice but to quit, says Bebb Cable Brexit vote absence 'unfortunate' Mr Hammond said his amendment was ""exactly in line"" with the negotiating position set out by the government last week. It supports the government's aim of negotiating a free trade area for goods but states if this has not happened by 21 January, ministers must change tack and start discussions on joining a customs union. Trying to avoid a rebellion, International Trade Minister George Hollingbery offered to make new changes to the bill when it reaches the House of Lords. ""Let's do this the other way round,"" Mr Hammond replied, urging the government to accept his amendment instead. The motion on joining a customs union is being backed by Labour, making the risk of defeat more likely. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019 but has yet to agree how its final relationship with the bloc will work. The government, which does not have a Commons majority, has been under pressure from MPs on both sides of the Brexit debate. The Trade Bill would create new structures for dealing with trade disputes after Brexit and carry over up to 40 existing EU trade agreements with other countries that the UK wishes to stick with until new deals are struck. The government twice survived by just three votes on Monday after a backlash from pro-European Tories who accused the prime minister of ""caving in"" to the party's Eurosceptic MPs.

At their last meeting in June, the nine-member MPC was split 6-3, with dissenters calling for a quarter-point rise to 0.75%. Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, called the latest figures on wages and jobs ""mildly disappointing"". ""All in all, these numbers don't alter the economic picture of anaemic growth, a relatively tight labour market and under-control inflation,"" he said. ""Markets are still expecting the Bank of England to raise interest rates in August. But given the increasingly uncertain climate, I think there's a real chance policymakers will sit on their hands and wait for firmer signals the economy is on the right track before risking raising borrowing costs."" However, Andrew Wishart, UK economist at Capital Economics, said he did not think the latest data would deter the Bank from raising rates. ""The recent easing in wage growth looks unlikely to be sustained,"" he said. ""Leading indicators of pay suggest that it is on track to at least meet the Bank of England's forecast for underlying wage growth of 2.75% y/y in Q4. As such, we continue to expect the MPC to vote to raise interest rates next month."" Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), said the latest slowdown in pay growth was ""disappointing"". ""This means that earnings growth in real terms remains in positive territory by just a small margin and so is unlikely to provide much of a boost to consumer spending power,"" he said. ""While we expect that interest rates will rise sooner rather than later, with earnings growth underwhelming, there remains sufficient scope for the MPC to keep a rates hike on hold for longer, particularly given the current economic and political uncertainty."" Tej Parikh, senior economist at the Institute of Directors, said: ""Clamour for an August interest rate rise has been building, but the sluggish pay growth should give pause for thought. The Bank should pay heed to the array of obstacles standing in the way of firms, from the burden of business rates to Brexit uncertainty, when it comes to making its decision.""

"There are an estimated 100,000 full time private tutors working in the UK, according to the Tutors' Association The UK's biggest teaching union has called for all private home tutors to face criminal record checks before being allowed to work with children. The National Education Union (NEU) said teachers barred from classrooms may try to work as private tutors. Research by the Sutton Trust charity suggests the number of children in England and Wales who received tuition has doubled in a decade. The government said parents could carry out a range of checks on tutors. A minister said families could check the outcome of misconduct panel hearings. It is estimated more than 350,000 secondary-aged school children have received private tuition in 2018, according to a survey commissioned by the Sutton Trust, up from about 160,000 in 2009. One in three children said the extra private tuition - where a parent has paid for the child to have additional academic teaching on top of their lessons at school - was to help with their GSCE exams. It is thought there are up to 100,000 full-time tutors in the UK, according to the Tutors' Association. Unlike classroom teachers, tutors do not have to undergo aDisclosure and Barring Service (DBS) check,externalbefore working with children. Teachers are subjected to an enhanced DBS check, which determines whether they have any previous criminal convictions or have been barred from working with children. In May, 49-year-old Sanjeev Mittal, from Birmingham,was jailed for five years for abusing two girls during home school lessons. Parent Aliceson O'Beirne, from Leeds, said she was shocked to discover tutors were not regulated like classroom teachers. ""I employ a tutor to help my daughter Eve and I think it's incredibly important that everybody working with children should have the appropriate checks."" Parent Aliceson O'Beirne said she was shocked tutors are not regulated like classroom teachers Ian March, from the NEU, said: ""It's important that tuition is not an unregulated industry. ""It's absolutely vital that the government makes sure everyone who works as a tutor has a DBS check as people may work as a private tutor when they've been barred from working in other teaching environments."" Tube station named Gareth Southgate Cliff crash paraglider rescued from ledge Caving: 'The last true UK wilderness' Labour MP Rachael Maskell said she was alerted to the legal loophole after a teenage constituent said she had been groomed for abuse by a private tutor. The York Central MP said: ""There is a real concern that anybody could turn up as a tutor and enter somebody's own home, or be in a one-to-one relationship, with a vulnerable young person. ""I think the risks are enormous and we now need a proper process around this."" Under the law all classroom teachers face criminal record checks, but private tutors do not face the same checks Adam Muckle, president of The Tutors' Association, the UK's only professional body for tutors and tuition companies, backed the call for a change in the law. ""The Tutors' Association asks all its members to have DBS checks as well as checking their academic qualifications,"" he said. ""Our tutors also have references and testimonials as well as being signed up to a code of conduct."" Minister for Children and Families Nadhim Zahawi said: ""Nothing is more important than the safety of children and if parents decide to employ a private tutor for their children they should assure themselves of a tutor's suitability beforehand. ""There are a range of checks parents can carry out, including checking the outcomes of the teacher misconduct panel hearings to see if a private tutor has been prohibited from teaching.""

"Three of the band members were arrested and convicted for the cathedral performance in 2012 The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has condemned Russia for its handling of two high-profile cases. It said Russia had violated five articles of the human rights convention in its arrest and conviction of Pussy Riot members in 2012. Three women from the activist group were arrested after performing a protest song in a Moscow cathedral. Separately, the ECHR also heavily criticised the investigation into journalist Anna Politkovskaya's murder. Politkovskaya was shot dead in a lift in her block of flats in 2006.Five men were found guilty of her murder in 2014, although it is still not known who commissioned the assassination. The investigative reporter was a vocal critic of Russia's war in Chechnya, and of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Russia had failed to ""take adequate investigatory steps"" to find who commissioned the murder,external, violating Article 2 of the convention, the court said. In 2015,Russia's parliament passed a law allowing it to overrule judgements from the ECHRafter the court ruled against the country for state spying. In the Pussy Riot case, two band members served 16 months in prison after their conviction. Formed in 2011, the group has a varying membership of women who support feminism and agitate against President Putin and the state. On Monday,Russia jailed four members of the band for disrupting the World Cup Finalwith a pitch invasion.

What is the European Court of Human Rights? Pussy Riot's extended detention before trial and lack of access to their lawyers also broke the convention, it added. Moreover, the ECHR said the Russian court twice violated Article 10 - freedom of expression - by banning access to the group's videos online and for condemning the group's conduct and clothing, rather than examining the content of their protest song, during the trial.

"Members of Parliament will not vote on whether to start their summer recess this Thursday, despite the government tabling a motion to do so. A motion to bring forward the summer break by five days was not moved when called by Speaker John Bercow on Tuesday, meaning no vote will happen.

The government could have been defeated, as a number of Conservative backbenchers were against the motion, as well as Labour and the SNP.

"The lessons want to reduce the risk of teenagers getting involved in knife crime during the summer holidays Teenagers in England are being given lessons in school to reduce the risk of knife violence in the summer holidays. End-of-term activities might be expected to be sports days, school trips and concerts, but the Home Office is providing anti-knife lessons. They are telling young people not to believe the ""myth"" that it is safer for them to carry a knife. Crime Minister Victoria Atkins said young people need to be kept safe from the ""rise in serious violence"". With the end of term approaching, secondary schools are giving safety lessons from the Home Office designed to reduce the risk of stabbings during the long hot summer holidays. The lessons, for 11 to 16-year-olds, warn young people not to believe everything they see on social media, and that it is false to believe most other youngsters have knives or that carrying a knife is a form of self-defence. There have been many high-profile incidents involving young people and knife crime Teenagers are being told about how a culture of gangs, knives and violence could ruin their future, and how to resist peer pressure. The anti-knife lessons are being taught through personal, health and social education classes, with the Home Office providing information to 50,000 subject specialists. Knife crime increased by 22% last year in England and Wales, according to the Office for National Statistics, with almost 40,000 offences involving a knife or sharp instrument - and there has been a series of high-profile fatal stabbings involving young people, particularly in London. The House of Commons library published figures from hospitals last month showing more than 4,400 injuries from sharp objects last year needing to be treated by consultants - up by almost 22% compared with two years before. The lessons are meant to prevent the harm caused by knife violence The knife crime lessons are part of a wider Home Office strategy to deter young people from carrying knives, and to reduce acts of serious violence. ""The summer holidays can pose additional dangers to young people, which is why we are determined to do everything we can to keep them safe and give them the tools and resilience they need to enjoy the summer break,"" said Ms Atkins. Children's Minister Nadhim Zahawi backed the lessons, saying ""knife crime has devastating consequences"" and that children and families need to be protected from its threat.

"Netflix's The Crown received 13 Emmy nominations this year Netflix shares plunged by more than 14% in after-hours trade on Monday, after the firm reported disappointing subscriber growth. Netflix said it added 5.2 million subscribers in the three months to the end of June, the same number it did during the period last year. The streaming service had forecast growth of 6.2 million. The decline in share price follows a successful run for the stock, which had roughly doubled so far this year. The firm's shares ended Monday's trading session at about $400, but tumbled by 14% after the market closed as investors digested the firm's quarterly results. Investors are worried about Netflix's growth potential in the face of increased competition from tech giants such as Apple, YouTube and Amazon, as well as traditional firms, which have started to invest more in online streaming. Disney, for example, plans to launch its own streaming service and stop licensing some of its material to Netflix. Why is Disney buying Fox? 6 Things we learned from the Emmy nominations Netflix acknowledged the challenges, but said its strategy is to ""keep improving"". ""We believe that consumer appetite for great content is broad and that there is room for multiple parties to have attractive offerings,"" it said. In a letter to investors, Netflix called it a ""strong but not stellar quarter"", ending with about 130 million subscribers globally. The firm added just 670,000 subscribers in the US - far short of the more than one million it added in the second quarter of 2017. It added 4.5 million subscribers internationally, fewer than the two most recent quarters but up 8% year-on-year. However, it said its finances were strong. The company reported $3.9bn in quarterly revenue, up 40% compared to the second quarter of 2017. Profits totalled $384.3m, almost six times the figure during the same period a year ago. Dave Lee, BBC North America technology reporter, San Francisco In its note to investors, Netflix pointed out a landmark achievement ahead of this year's Emmy's - it had, for the first time, earned more nominations than rival HBO. A huge stamp of approval for the firm's original content. But critical acclaim is worthless to Netflix unless it translates into booming business. Growth is the only metric that really matters to the firm's investors, and so this is a big miss - reflected in the stock price tanking on Monday. However, investors might be wise to not lose their heads - this disappointing earnings report comes off the back of two extremely strong quarters of comfortably beating expectations on adding subscribers. Netflix said its strategy will be to ""simply keep improving"" as more players start to step up their efforts to muscle in on its turf.

"Liz Bilney (left) has been referred to the police Campaign group Leave.EU has been fined Â£70,000 for breaches of election law in the 2016 EU referendum. The Electoral Commission said the group - which was separate from the official pro-Brexit group Vote Leave - failed to report ""at least"" Â£77,380 it spent. It has also referred Leave.EU chief executive Liz Bilney to the police following its investigation into what it calls ""serious offences"". Leave.EU co-founder Arron Banks called it a ""politically motivated attack"". Responding to theElectoral Commission's findings,external, he said: ""What a shambles, we will see them in court."" All you need to know about Brexit Brexit: Your guide to EU jargon EU referendum: The result in maps The investigation also looked into whether Leave.EU had received any services from Cambridge Analytica which should have been declared on its spending return but found no evidence that the group received donations or paid for services from the political consultancy. Leave.EU's relationship with the controversial firm ""did not develop beyond initial scoping work"", according to the Commission. The UK voted by 52% to 48% to leave the European Union in a referendum in June 2016. All groups had to ensure they met campaign spending rules and filed accurate returns under the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000.

Its spending return also did not include services Leave.EU had received from a US campaign strategy firm, Goddard Gunster, and the group ""inaccurately reported"" three loans totalling Â£6m from Mr Banks - including who had provided them - and did not provide invoices or receipts for 97 separate payments, totalling Â£80,224. The Commission has referred Leave.EU chief executive Liz Bilney to the police, saying it had reasonable grounds to suspect she had committed criminal offences over campaign spending. Bob Posner, the Commission's director of political finance and regulation, said spending rules were in place to ensure public confidence in democracy and it was ""disappointing that Leave.EU, a key player in the EU referendum, was unable to abide by these rules"". ""These are serious offences. The level of fine we have imposed has been constrained by the cap on the Commission's fines,"" he added. But Mr Banks told the BBC's Daily Politics that Leave.EU had responded to the Commission with a 20-page report from an independent accountant which, he said, the watchdog had ""ignored completely"". He described the disputed amount as ""an internal management charge which our lawyers have told us wasn't reportable"" and claimed the Commission was staffed by pro-Remainers and the ruling was politically motivated. ""Effectively what they have done is, they started off their investigation with a remit of investigating Cambridge Analytica and dark Russian money - they have found no evidence of any of those things and they have fined us on a technical accounting issue which is heavily in dispute."" Mr Banks said they intended to challenge the finding in court. Electoral Commission chief executive Claire Bassett denied claims of bias made by Mr Banks. She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""The decisions were made by directors of the Electoral Commission, they were made based on robust evidence we had gathered, and indeed you can see that in the 30-page report that we published."" Leave.EU is not the only group to fall foul of spending rules in the EU Referendum campaign. TheLib Dems were fined Â£18,000and the official Remain campaign was fined Â£1,250 by the Commission last year. The official Vote Leave group - that was backed by cabinet ministers Boris Johnson and Michael Gove - isstill under investigation. Thepro-EU European Movement UK and UKIP have also been finedover their referendum spending. The maximum fine is Â£20,000 per offence - Leave.EU was fined for four separate offences.

"This video can not be played Flying lava hits a tour boat A ""lava bomb"" has struck a tour boat in Hawaii, injuring 23 people, officials in the US state say. An explosion sent rocks and debris hurtling through the air and through the roof of the tourist vessel. One passenger broke a leg while others suffered burns. The authorities are investigating. The lava is from Hawaii's Kilauea volcano, which erupted in May and has been spewing out gas and molten rock ever since. Volcano's dramatic images explained The explosion left a gaping hole in the roof of the tour boat, which had been taking visitors out to view lava plunging into the sea. Hawaii County fire department battalion chief Darwin Okinaka told Reuters the boat had returned to port under its own power, and three of the injured were taken away by ambulance. Authorities said the boat was operated by Lava Ocean Tours, which charges about $250 (Â£188) a head to watch lava flow into the sea from a tour boat. The explosion ripped a hole in the top of the boat Will Bryan, who was on the boat with his girlfriend Erin, described the terrifying moment when the vessel was hit. ""As soon as you saw it coming there was no time to move and the worst part was you're in a small boat,"" Mr Bryan told the BBC. ""So as you're getting pelted with this lava there is nowhere to go. You only have like 20 feet [6m], and everyone is trying to hide at the same spot. It was actually rather terrifying. ""For a little bit afterwards there was just chaos, and the captain tried to do what he could to keep everyone calm but you can't. Erin's face was covered in soot and my back was hot. It was just scary."" Some passengers told Hawaii's Department of Land and Natural Resources thatthe boat was outside a safety zone established by the coastguard,external. Rules prohibit ships from getting any closer than 300m to a lava flow entering the sea, although a coastguard spokesperson told Reuters news agency that experienced boat operators had received special permissions to get far closer. Officials have warned of the dangers of toxic fumes, created when molten rock hits the sea and forms hazardous clouds containing hydrochloric acid and glass particles. Kilauea is one of the world's most active volcanoes, and its eruption has destroyed hundreds of homes and forced thousands to evacuate. But until now there had only been one serious injury,a man whose leg was hit by a projectile of molten rock as he sat on a balcony. Last week, scientists at the US Geological Survey said the flow of lava had created a new small  island.

"Netflix's The Crown received 13 Emmy nominations this year Netflix shares plunged by more than 14% in after-hours trade on Monday, after the firm reported disappointing subscriber growth. Netflix said it added 5.2 million subscribers in the three months to the end of June, the same number it did during the period last year. The streaming service had forecast growth of 6.2 million. The decline in share price follows a successful run for the stock, which had roughly doubled so far this year. The firm's shares ended Monday's trading session at about $400, but tumbled by 14% after the market closed as investors digested the firm's quarterly results. Investors are worried about Netflix's growth potential in the face of increased competition from tech giants such as Apple, YouTube and Amazon, as well as traditional firms, which have started to invest more in online streaming. Disney, for example, plans to launch its own streaming service and stop licensing some of its material to Netflix. Why is Disney buying Fox? 6 Things we learned from the Emmy nominations Netflix acknowledged the challenges, but said its strategy is to ""keep improving"". ""We believe that consumer appetite for great content is broad and that there is room for multiple parties to have attractive offerings,"" it said. In a letter to investors, Netflix called it a ""strong but not stellar quarter"", ending with about 130 million subscribers globally. The firm added just 670,000 subscribers in the US - far short of the more than one million it added in the second quarter of 2017. It added 4.5 million subscribers internationally, fewer than the two most recent quarters but up 8% year-on-year. However, it said its finances were strong. The company reported $3.9bn in quarterly revenue, up 40% compared to the second quarter of 2017. Profits totalled $384.3m, almost six times the figure during the same period a year ago. Dave Lee, BBC North America technology reporter, San Francisco In its note to investors, Netflix pointed out a landmark achievement ahead of this year's Emmy's - it had, for the first time, earned more nominations than rival HBO. A huge stamp of approval for the firm's original content. But critical acclaim is worthless to Netflix unless it translates into booming business. Growth is the only metric that really matters to the firm's investors, and so this is a big miss - reflected in the stock price tanking on Monday. However, investors might be wise to not lose their heads - this disappointing earnings report comes off the back of two extremely strong quarters of comfortably beating expectations on adding subscribers. Netflix said its strategy will be to ""simply keep improving"" as more players start to step up their efforts to muscle in on its turf.

"The lessons want to reduce the risk of teenagers getting involved in knife crime during the summer holidays Teenagers in England are being given lessons in school to reduce the risk of knife violence in the summer holidays. End-of-term activities might be expected to be sports days, school trips and concerts, but the Home Office is providing anti-knife lessons. They are telling young people not to believe the ""myth"" that it is safer for them to carry a knife. Crime Minister Victoria Atkins said young people need to be kept safe from the ""rise in serious violence"". With the end of term approaching, secondary schools are giving safety lessons from the Home Office designed to reduce the risk of stabbings during the long hot summer holidays. The lessons, for 11 to 16-year-olds, warn young people not to believe everything they see on social media, and that it is false to believe most other youngsters have knives or that carrying a knife is a form of self-defence. There have been many high-profile incidents involving young people and knife crime Teenagers are being told about how a culture of gangs, knives and violence could ruin their future, and how to resist peer pressure. The anti-knife lessons are being taught through personal, health and social education classes, with the Home Office providing information to 50,000 subject specialists. Knife crime increased by 22% last year in England and Wales, according to the Office for National Statistics, with almost 40,000 offences involving a knife or sharp instrument - and there has been a series of high-profile fatal stabbings involving young people, particularly in London. The House of Commons library published figures from hospitals last month showing more than 4,400 injuries from sharp objects last year needing to be treated by consultants - up by almost 22% compared with two years before. The lessons are meant to prevent the harm caused by knife violence The knife crime lessons are part of a wider Home Office strategy to deter young people from carrying knives, and to reduce acts of serious violence. ""The summer holidays can pose additional dangers to young people, which is why we are determined to do everything we can to keep them safe and give them the tools and resilience they need to enjoy the summer break,"" said Ms Atkins. Children's Minister Nadhim Zahawi backed the lessons, saying ""knife crime has devastating consequences"" and that children and families need to be protected from its threat.

"Brexit campaign group Vote Leave has been fined Â£61,000 and referred to the police after an Electoral Commission probe said it broke electoral law. The watchdog said it exceeded its Â£7m spending limit by funnelling Â£675,315 through pro-Brexit youth group BeLeave. The founder of BeLeave, Darren Grimes, has been fined Â£20,000 and referred to the police, along with Vote Leave official David Halsall. Vote Leave said the ""wholly inaccurate"" report was politically motivated. The Vote Leave campaign, which was fronted by Boris Johnson and Michael Gove, won the contest to be the official Leave campaign in the 2016 referendum on whether Britain should stay in the European Union. Parliament Live: MPs debate post-Brexit trade plans Leave.EU fined Â£70,000 over Brexit spending Call for 'clarity' on referendum cash rules Brexit: All you need to know The result of the referendum was 51.9% for Leave and 48.1% for Remain. The UK is due to officially leave the European Union at 23:00 GMT on 29 March, 2019. The referendum was not legally binding, merely ""advisory,""according to a Supreme Court judgement in December 2016, so it can't be ordered to be re-run by a court - any decision to have a fresh referendum would have to be made by the government and Parliament would have to pass a referendum act. Reality Check: How would the UK hold a second EU referendum? The Electoral Commission has referred Mr Grimes and Mr Halsall to the Metropolitan Police in relation to false declarations of campaign spending, and handed over files ""in relation to whether any persons have committed related offences"" that fall outside the watchdog's remit. Darren Grimes founded youth group BeLeave Vote Leave and the official Remain campaign Britain Stronger in Europe were allowed to spend Â£7m each on campaigning in the run up to the referendum. Vote Leave spent nearly Â£2.7m of its Â£7m budget on the services of a Canadian digital marketing firm, Aggregate IQ. A further Â£675,315 was sent to Aggregate IQ by BeLeave, a group set up by Mr Grimes, then a fashion student at Brighton university. The money came from Vote Leave which has said in the past it was told by the Electoral Commission it was allowed to do this because BeLeave was a separate campaign group. But the Electoral Commission - which is the watchdog overseeing elections in the UK and ensuring that UK laws on spending by political parties are followed - has ruled that the two groups were working together and Mr Grimes had ""wrongly"" reported the spending as his own. This meant that, including this amount, the Electoral Commission says Vote Leave spent Â£7,449,079, breaching its Â£7m spending limit. Darren Grimes is also said to have exceeded the Â£10,000 he was allowed to spend as a non-registered campaigner, the watchdog said. Bob Posner, from the Electoral Commission, said: ""We found substantial evidence that the two groups worked to a common plan, did not declare their joint working and did not adhere to the legal spending limits. These are serious breaches of the laws put in place by Parliament to ensure fairness and transparency at elections and referendums."" He added: ""Vote Leave has resisted our investigation from the start, including contesting our right as the statutory regulator to open the investigation. It has refused to cooperate, refused our requests to put forward a representative for interview, and forced us to use our legal powers to compel it to provide evidence. ""Nevertheless, the evidence we have found is clear and substantial, and can now be seen in our report."" It is impossible to say how overspending by the Vote Leave campaign affected the referendum result. It all went to one marketing firm, which developed highly-targeted Facebook advertising. In a quote since removed from the Aggregate IQ website, Vote Leave campaign director Dominic Cummings said: ""We couldn't have done it without them."" Former Vote Leave activist Shahmir Sanni, who went public with allegations about overspending earlier this year, told BBC Radio 4's The World at One the extra cash spent by BeLeave had affected the referendum outcome - saying such a sum ""can make all the difference"". Anti-Brexit Labour peer Lord Adonis said Vote Leave's overspending ""could have been decisive"" in the 2016 referendum because it was a close result but he did not want to re-run that campaign. Instead, he said ""all of those responsible for this breach of the law"" should be ""barred"" from playing any part in any future referendum, such as the one he is calling for on the final Brexit deal. This video can not be played MPs expressed their anger at Vote Leave Labour is calling for Tory ministers who were key figures in Vote Leave to be referred to the cabinet secretary to determine whether they had broken the ministerial code. In a statement on Twitter, Mr Grimes said it was ""incredible"" that he had been fined Â£20,000 ""on the basis of the wrong box being ticked on an application form"". He said he had been interviewed by the Electoral Commission during two previous investigations and had never been ""provided with particulars"" of the allegation that he had worked on a ""common plan"" with Vote Leave so that he could ""make representations about it"". ""Politicians say they want young people to engage with politics. I was 22 when I got involved in a referendum I felt passionately about. I did nothing wrong,"" he added. ""I have been persecuted for over two years by powerful people for nothing more than engaging in the democratic process and having the temerity to be on the winning side. It has been appalling for my family."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Electoral Commission cleared Vote Leave of breaking spending limits in March last year but re-opened its investigation in October, saying new evidence had come to light from its own investigations, media reports, academics and whistleblowers. Third Vote Leave whistleblower revealed Another pro-Brexit group, Veterans for Britain, was also found to have inaccurately reported a donation it received from Vote Leave and has been fined Â£250. Vote Leave also returned an ""incomplete and inaccurate spending report"", with almost Â£234,501 reported incorrectly, and invoices missing for Â£12,849.99 of spending, the watchdog said. A Vote Leave spokesman said: ""The Electoral Commission's report contains a number of false accusations and incorrect assertions that are wholly inaccurate and do not stand up to scrutiny. ""It is astonishing that nobody from Vote Leave has been interviewed by the commission in the production of this report, nor indeed at any point in the past two years. Yet the commission has interviewed the so-called 'whistleblowers' who have no knowledge of how Vote Leave operated and whose credibility has been seriously called into question. ""Vote Leave has provided evidence to the Electoral Commission proving there was no wrongdoing. And yet despite clear evidence of wrongdoing by the Remain campaign, the commission has chosen to ignore this and refused to launch an investigation. ""All this suggests that the supposedly impartial commission is motivated by a political agenda rather than uncovering the facts. ""The commission has failed to follow due process, and in doing so has based its conclusions on unfounded claims and conspiracy theories. ""We will consider the options available to us, but are confident that these findings will be overturned."" This video can not be played Former Vote Leave chief Matthew Elliott defended his group's actions The Electoral Commission hit back at allegations of political bias, saying: ""We open investigations where the evidence justifies it, irrespective of the political views of the party or campaigner concerned."" It also insisted it had followed ""due process"" and had spent three months and made five attempts to interview Vote Leave representatives. Months into the investigation, ""certain Vote Leave staff members came to us separately and offered to be interviewed"", an Electoral Commission source said, but by that point it had gathered enough evidence to conclude that an offence had occurred. Asked whether it believed the referendum result was still valid, No 10 said the public delivered a ""clear verdict"" which the government was in the process of implementing. But speaking in the Commons, former Tory home secretary Amber Rudd said ministers should not use this to ""obfuscate"" from its duty to protect the electoral system from abuses. And Tory MP Sarah Wollaston, who voted to remain, called for the referendum to be re-run. A separate Brexit campaign, Leave.EU, was fined Â£70,000 in March for failing to declare ""at least"" Â£77,380 it spent on referendum campaigning. Leave.EU chief executive Liz Bilney was referred to the police following the commission's investigation. Leave.EU co-founder Arron Banks called it a ""politically motivated attack"" and said he would take the watchdog to court. Leave.EU, which was fronted by then-UKIP leader Nigel Farage, was only allowed to spend Â£700,000 in the run up to the referendum, after losing out to Vote Leave in the battle to designated the official Leave campaign. The official Remain campaign Britain Stronger in Europe, was fined Â£1,250 in December last year for not providing invoices and for declaring some spending in aggregate rather than individual payments.

"The UK heatwave has led to much talk of whether there will be hosepipe bans, although so far onlyNorthern Ireland Waterhas introduced one. But do they work? The answer is that they probably do, although the reductions in water demand tend not to be huge. There's been some research into the effectiveness of hosepipe bans, particularly looking at the widespread bans in 2006 and 2012. The problem with 2012 was that the restrictions were introduced in early April - but almost immediately heavy rain set in, which led to extensive flooding. The problems with enforcing a ban when there are flood warnings in place, together with the fact that people would be considerably less likely to use hosepipes to water their gardens or fill swimming pools during a period of heavy rain, mean that 2012 was not really a representative example. Incidentally, the water companies no longer call them hosepipe bans - they were replaced in 2010 bytemporary use bans (Tubs),external, which cover almost anything you might consider doing at home with a hosepipe, such as cleaning a patio, washing a car, filling an ornamental fountain and even cleaning a private leisure boat. The idea of a hosepipe ban is to reduce the level of water consumption to winter levels. Joint research by the universities ofManchester, Edinburgh, Southampton and Lancaster,externalin 2014 suggested that fewer than 20% of people with gardens ever used a hosepipe to water it. The Energy Saving Trust estimates that of the average 142 litres (284 pints) of water used per person per day,only about 1% goes on the garden and 1% on the car,external. On the other hand, running a hosepipe for an hour uses about 1,000 litres of water, so it doesn't take many people watering the garden every day with a hose to add up to a considerable amount of water. A report by UK Water Industry Research,externalfound an 18% fall in consumption in 2012, although that did not take into account the impact of the weather. As mentioned, you would expect people to use less water, especially outdoors, if it's raining. A report prepared for the Environment Agency,externaldid take account of the wet weather when it looked at the impact of the restrictions. It found that in 2012 there was not a statistically significant reduction in water usage after the introduction of the Tub. But it also looked at 2006 when, it found, there had been a fall of about 10% in usage, which was statistically significant, although it was not possible to demonstrate conclusively that this was due to the restrictions. Rob Lawson, from Artesia Consulting, told BBC Reality Check that water consumption in a dry summer typically increased by about 10%-25% compared with winter but this could be as high as 40%-50% in specific areas for short periods during heatwaves such as the one we are experiencing at the moment. A hosepipe ban is not the first measure taken by water companies - their first step is to call for restraint in the use of water. Severn Trent, United Utilities and Southern Waterare currently encouraging their customers to take steps such as taking shorter showers and not using unattended hosepipes. If a Tub does not save enough water, then further restrictions may be imposed such as non-essential use drought orders, which restrict non-domestic water use, preventing companies and local authorities from using hoses to clean windows, water plants and fill fountains and swimming pools, for example. A drought order would also stop golf courses using mains water to keep their grass green, although it would not prevent them using water from lakes or boreholes on the courses. Water companies have to produce drought plans, which outline what steps they would take to deal with water shortages, some of which include estimates for how much water would be saved. Thames Water's drought plan,externalincludes estimates of how much water each step it takes will save. It predicts the biggest savings (between 7% and 10% in summer) will come from a media campaign together with a ban on unattended hoses and sprinklers, which could be imposed before a Tub, although other water companies consider it as part of a Tub. A full hosepipe ban would then save another 3%-4%, the company predicts. United Utilities' drought plan,externalsays: ""The savings associated with a campaign for voluntary water use restraint has been estimated to be 3%-5% of the average dry weather demand expected during the drought period. This is based on the experience of hosepipe bans introduced by us in 1995-96 and 2010."" Anglian Water estimates,externalthe savings from just hosepipe restrictions at between 5% and 7%. Southern Water says,externalthat a ban on unattended hosepipes and sprinklers would reduce demand by about 2.5% while a full hosepipe ban would save another 5%.

"Parts of Wayoh Reservoir, at Edgworth near Bolton, have dried up Water is being moved from Wales to boost depleted supplies across north-west England, amid warnings of an ""imminent"" hosepipe ban in the region. Reservoir levels have dropped during the heatwave, with those in Greater Manchester particularly affected, United Utilities (UU) said. The company said there had been a ""massive increase"" in demand for water. Supplies from the Lake District and Pennines are also being drawn upon to help ease the shortage. UU said it was struggling to process water quickly enough to meet high demand, while parts of Wayoh Reservoir, at Edgworth near Bolton, have completely dried up. The company said it was providing an additional half a billion litres of water a day above what it normally supplies to customers. A fuller Wayoh Reservoir While Greater Manchester has been a particular problem area, UU said the whole region was now at risk of a hosepipe ban ""in days rather than weeks"" if things did not improve. A spokesman said: ""Wayoh tells the story of the prolonged heatwave. ""Greater Manchester is served from various water sources, at present we are using our integrated regional water network moving water from North Wales, the Lakes and the Pennines to keep taps flowing. ""The prolonged hot weather means the region's reservoir stores have decreased since last week, with some reservoirs looking more dramatic than others. ""We are still encouraging our customers to voluntarily use water efficiently, by avoiding the use of water-hungry devices, particularly outside in the garden. ""A hosepipe ban could be imminent. If we can't bring the demand down for water, that would be the next logical step, and that could be in days rather than weeks.""

"Brexit campaign group Vote Leave has been fined Â£61,000 and referred to the police after an Electoral Commission probe said it broke electoral law. The watchdog said it exceeded its Â£7m spending limit by funnelling Â£675,315 through pro-Brexit youth group BeLeave. The founder of BeLeave, Darren Grimes, has been fined Â£20,000 and referred to the police, along with Vote Leave official David Halsall. Vote Leave said the ""wholly inaccurate"" report was politically motivated. The Vote Leave campaign, which was fronted by Boris Johnson and Michael Gove, won the contest to be the official Leave campaign in the 2016 referendum on whether Britain should stay in the European Union. Parliament Live: MPs debate post-Brexit trade plans Leave.EU fined Â£70,000 over Brexit spending Call for 'clarity' on referendum cash rules Brexit: All you need to know The result of the referendum was 51.9% for Leave and 48.1% for Remain. The UK is due to officially leave the European Union at 23:00 GMT on 29 March, 2019. The referendum was not legally binding, merely ""advisory,""according to a Supreme Court judgement in December 2016, so it can't be ordered to be re-run by a court - any decision to have a fresh referendum would have to be made by the government and Parliament would have to pass a referendum act. Reality Check: How would the UK hold a second EU referendum? The Electoral Commission has referred Mr Grimes and Mr Halsall to the Metropolitan Police in relation to false declarations of campaign spending, and handed over files ""in relation to whether any persons have committed related offences"" that fall outside the watchdog's remit. Darren Grimes founded youth group BeLeave Vote Leave and the official Remain campaign Britain Stronger in Europe were allowed to spend Â£7m each on campaigning in the run up to the referendum. Vote Leave spent nearly Â£2.7m of its Â£7m budget on the services of a Canadian digital marketing firm, Aggregate IQ. A further Â£675,315 was sent to Aggregate IQ by BeLeave, a group set up by Mr Grimes, then a fashion student at Brighton university. The money came from Vote Leave which has said in the past it was told by the Electoral Commission it was allowed to do this because BeLeave was a separate campaign group. But the Electoral Commission - which is the watchdog overseeing elections in the UK and ensuring that UK laws on spending by political parties are followed - has ruled that the two groups were working together and Mr Grimes had ""wrongly"" reported the spending as his own. This meant that, including this amount, the Electoral Commission says Vote Leave spent Â£7,449,079, breaching its Â£7m spending limit. Darren Grimes is also said to have exceeded the Â£10,000 he was allowed to spend as a non-registered campaigner, the watchdog said. Bob Posner, from the Electoral Commission, said: ""We found substantial evidence that the two groups worked to a common plan, did not declare their joint working and did not adhere to the legal spending limits. These are serious breaches of the laws put in place by Parliament to ensure fairness and transparency at elections and referendums."" He added: ""Vote Leave has resisted our investigation from the start, including contesting our right as the statutory regulator to open the investigation. It has refused to cooperate, refused our requests to put forward a representative for interview, and forced us to use our legal powers to compel it to provide evidence. ""Nevertheless, the evidence we have found is clear and substantial, and can now be seen in our report."" It is impossible to say how overspending by the Vote Leave campaign affected the referendum result. It all went to one marketing firm, which developed highly-targeted Facebook advertising. In a quote since removed from the Aggregate IQ website, Vote Leave campaign director Dominic Cummings said: ""We couldn't have done it without them."" Former Vote Leave activist Shahmir Sanni, who went public with allegations about overspending earlier this year, told BBC Radio 4's The World at One the extra cash spent by BeLeave had affected the referendum outcome - saying such a sum ""can make all the difference"". Anti-Brexit Labour peer Lord Adonis said Vote Leave's overspending ""could have been decisive"" in the 2016 referendum because it was a close result but he did not want to re-run that campaign. Instead, he said ""all of those responsible for this breach of the law"" should be ""barred"" from playing any part in any future referendum, such as the one he is calling for on the final Brexit deal. This video can not be played MPs expressed their anger at Vote Leave Labour is calling for Tory ministers who were key figures in Vote Leave to be referred to the cabinet secretary to determine whether they had broken the ministerial code. In a statement on Twitter, Mr Grimes said it was ""incredible"" that he had been fined Â£20,000 ""on the basis of the wrong box being ticked on an application form"". He said he had been interviewed by the Electoral Commission during two previous investigations and had never been ""provided with particulars"" of the allegation that he had worked on a ""common plan"" with Vote Leave so that he could ""make representations about it"". ""Politicians say they want young people to engage with politics. I was 22 when I got involved in a referendum I felt passionately about. I did nothing wrong,"" he added. ""I have been persecuted for over two years by powerful people for nothing more than engaging in the democratic process and having the temerity to be on the winning side. It has been appalling for my family."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Electoral Commission cleared Vote Leave of breaking spending limits in March last year but re-opened its investigation in October, saying new evidence had come to light from its own investigations, media reports, academics and whistleblowers. Third Vote Leave whistleblower revealed Another pro-Brexit group, Veterans for Britain, was also found to have inaccurately reported a donation it received from Vote Leave and has been fined Â£250. Vote Leave also returned an ""incomplete and inaccurate spending report"", with almost Â£234,501 reported incorrectly, and invoices missing for Â£12,849.99 of spending, the watchdog said. A Vote Leave spokesman said: ""The Electoral Commission's report contains a number of false accusations and incorrect assertions that are wholly inaccurate and do not stand up to scrutiny. ""It is astonishing that nobody from Vote Leave has been interviewed by the commission in the production of this report, nor indeed at any point in the past two years. Yet the commission has interviewed the so-called 'whistleblowers' who have no knowledge of how Vote Leave operated and whose credibility has been seriously called into question. ""Vote Leave has provided evidence to the Electoral Commission proving there was no wrongdoing. And yet despite clear evidence of wrongdoing by the Remain campaign, the commission has chosen to ignore this and refused to launch an investigation. ""All this suggests that the supposedly impartial commission is motivated by a political agenda rather than uncovering the facts. ""The commission has failed to follow due process, and in doing so has based its conclusions on unfounded claims and conspiracy theories. ""We will consider the options available to us, but are confident that these findings will be overturned."" This video can not be played Former Vote Leave chief Matthew Elliott defended his group's actions The Electoral Commission hit back at allegations of political bias, saying: ""We open investigations where the evidence justifies it, irrespective of the political views of the party or campaigner concerned."" It also insisted it had followed ""due process"" and had spent three months and made five attempts to interview Vote Leave representatives. Months into the investigation, ""certain Vote Leave staff members came to us separately and offered to be interviewed"", an Electoral Commission source said, but by that point it had gathered enough evidence to conclude that an offence had occurred. Asked whether it believed the referendum result was still valid, No 10 said the public delivered a ""clear verdict"" which the government was in the process of implementing. But speaking in the Commons, former Tory home secretary Amber Rudd said ministers should not use this to ""obfuscate"" from its duty to protect the electoral system from abuses. And Tory MP Sarah Wollaston, who voted to remain, called for the referendum to be re-run. A separate Brexit campaign, Leave.EU, was fined Â£70,000 in March for failing to declare ""at least"" Â£77,380 it spent on referendum campaigning. Leave.EU chief executive Liz Bilney was referred to the police following the commission's investigation. Leave.EU co-founder Arron Banks called it a ""politically motivated attack"" and said he would take the watchdog to court. Leave.EU, which was fronted by then-UKIP leader Nigel Farage, was only allowed to spend Â£700,000 in the run up to the referendum, after losing out to Vote Leave in the battle to designated the official Leave campaign. The official Remain campaign Britain Stronger in Europe, was fined Â£1,250 in December last year for not providing invoices and for declaring some spending in aggregate rather than individual payments.

"Plant roots were ground to add to the bread Scientists have discovered the earliest known evidence of bread-making, from a 14,000-year-old dig site. The bake would have looked like a flatbread and tasted a bit like today's multi-grain varieties, they say. Our ancestors may have used the bread as a wrap for roasted meat. Thus, as well as being the oldest bread, it may also have been the oldest sandwich. The find, from the Black Desert in Jordan, pushes back the first evidence for bread by more than 5,000 years. The stone age bread-makers took flour made from wild wheat and barley, mixed it with the pulverised roots of plants, added water, and then baked it. ""This is the earliest evidence we have for what we could really call a cuisine, in that it's a mixed food product,""  Prof Dorian Fuller of University College London told BBC News. ""They've got flatbreads, and they've got roasted gazelle and so forth, and that's something they are then using to make a meal."" Ali Shakaiteer and Dr Amaia Arranz-Otaegui sampling cereals in the area where the bread was discovered Bread has long been part of our staple diet. But little is known about the origins of bread-making. Until now, the oldest evidence of bread came from Turkey; those finds are 9,000 years old. Scientists uncovered two buildings, each containing a large circular stone fireplace within which charred bread crumbs were found. Iceman's last meal was high fat feast Why we may soon have no bananas (again) Separating plant remains from excavated soil Analysed under the microscope, the bread samples showed tell-tale signs of grinding, sieving and kneading. Dr Amaia Arranz-Otaegui of the University of Copenhagen, who discovered the remains of the bread, said it was the last thing they expected to find at the site. ""Bread is a powerful link between our past and present food cultures,"" she said. ""It connects us with our prehistoric ancestors."" The bread would have been made in several stages, including ""grinding cereals and club-rush tubers to obtain fine flour, mixing of flour with water to produce dough, and baking the dough in the hot ashes of a fireplace or in a hot flat-stone"", she explained. Make flour from wild wheat and wild barley Pound tubers (roots) of wild plants that grow in water (sedges or club- or bull-rushes) to a dry pulp Mix together with water to make a batter or dough Bake on hot stones around a fire. The people living in the area at the time were hunter-gatherers. They would have hunted gazelle and trapped smaller animals such as hares and birds. They also foraged for plant foods such as nuts, fruits and wild cereals. The researchers think the bread was made when people gathered together for a celebration or feast. This happened before the advent of farming, when people started growing cereal crops and keeping animals. The fireplace where the bread was found at an archaeological site known as Shubayqa 1 This raises the intriguing possibility that growing cereals for bread may have been the driving force behind farming. ""The significance of this bread is that it shows investment of extra effort into making food that has mixed ingredients,"" said Prof Fuller. ""So, making some sort of a recipe, and that implies that bread played a special role for special occasions. ""That in turn suggests one of the possible motivations as to why people later chose to cultivate and domesticate wheat and barley, because wheat and barley were species that already had a special place in terms of special foods."" The crumbs were 5.7mm long by 4.4mm wide and 2.5mm thick The bread was unleavened and would have resembled a wrap, pitta bread or chapatti. Researchers have tried to reconstruct the recipe in the lab. They say the mixed grains gave the bread a nutty flavour, much like today's multi-grain loaves. Lara GonzÃ¡lez Carretero, from the UCL Institute of Archaeology, who is an expert on prehistoric bread, examined the 24 crumbs under an electron microscope. ""This would be a bread made of wild wheat and wild barley flour, mixed with water, and cooked on a hearth on a fireplace,"" she said.

"Jeremy Corbyn has previously said he is ""sincerely sorry"" for the pain caused by ""pockets of anti-Semitism"" in the Labour Party The chief rabbi has said Labour will be ""on the wrong side"" of the fight against racism unless it toughens up its anti-Semitism code of conduct. Ephraim Mirvis said Labour's anti-Semitism definition sent ""an unprecedented message of contempt to the Jewish community"". Labour has defended its new code as the most ""comprehensive"" of any party. However, Labour MPs have overwhelmingly backed calls to broaden their party's definition of anti-Semitism. The MPs backed a motion to adopt in full the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's (IHRA) working definition of anti-Semitism. MPs criticise Labour's anti-Semitism code Labour's code, which was approved by a sub-committee of its National Executive Committee (NEC) earlier this month, was drawn up following the 2016Chakrabarti inquiry,externalinto anti-Semitism. The NEC rubber-stamped the new code when it met on Tuesday, but a Labour spokesperson added: ""In recognition of the serious concerns expressed, agreed to re-open the development of the code, in consultation with Jewish community organisations and groups, in order to better reflect their views."" The code does endorse the IHRA's working definition of anti-Semitism and includes behaviours it lists as likely to be regarded as anti-Semitic - but critics point out that it leaves out four examples from that definition: Accusing Jewish people of being more loyal to Israel than their home country Claiming that Israel's existence as a state is a racist endeavour Requiring higher standards of behaviour from Israel than other nations Comparing contemporary Israeli policies to those of the Nazis Chief rabbi Ephraim Mirvis attacked the omission of these examples and said it was ""astonishing that the Labour Party presumes it is more qualified"" to define anti-Semitism than the Jewish community. ""Adoption of Labour's new alternative to the internationally accepted IHRA definition will send an unprecedented message of contempt to the Jewish community,"" he added. In a letter to members of Labour's ruling committee he said this was ""a watershed moment"" for the party and urged them to ""make the right decision for Britain"". Ephraim Mirvis said Labour risked being on the ""wrong side of the fight"" against racism and intolerance However, Labour insists the four examples are addressed in their guidelines. ""These are the most detailed and comprehensive guidelines on anti-Semitism adopted by any political party in this country,"" the party said. ""They adopt the IHRA definition and contextualise and add to the working examples to produce a practical code of conduct that a political party can apply in disciplinary cases.""

"This video can not be played Flying lava hits a tour boat A ""lava bomb"" has struck a tour boat in Hawaii, injuring 23 people, officials in the US state say. An explosion sent rocks and debris hurtling through the air and through the roof of the tourist vessel. One passenger broke a leg while others suffered burns. The authorities are investigating. The lava is from Hawaii's Kilauea volcano, which erupted in May and has been spewing out gas and molten rock ever since. Volcano's dramatic images explained The explosion left a gaping hole in the roof of the tour boat, which had been taking visitors out to view lava plunging into the sea. Hawaii County fire department battalion chief Darwin Okinaka told Reuters the boat had returned to port under its own power, and three of the injured were taken away by ambulance. Authorities said the boat was operated by Lava Ocean Tours, which charges about $250 (Â£188) a head to watch lava flow into the sea from a tour boat. The explosion ripped a hole in the top of the boat Will Bryan, who was on the boat with his girlfriend Erin, described the terrifying moment when the vessel was hit. ""As soon as you saw it coming there was no time to move and the worst part was you're in a small boat,"" Mr Bryan told the BBC. ""So as you're getting pelted with this lava there is nowhere to go. You only have like 20 feet [6m], and everyone is trying to hide at the same spot. It was actually rather terrifying. ""For a little bit afterwards there was just chaos, and the captain tried to do what he could to keep everyone calm but you can't. Erin's face was covered in soot and my back was hot. It was just scary."" Some passengers told Hawaii's Department of Land and Natural Resources thatthe boat was outside a safety zone established by the coastguard,external. Rules prohibit ships from getting any closer than 300m to a lava flow entering the sea, although a coastguard spokesperson told Reuters news agency that experienced boat operators had received special permissions to get far closer. Officials have warned of the dangers of toxic fumes, created when molten rock hits the sea and forms hazardous clouds containing hydrochloric acid and glass particles. Kilauea is one of the world's most active volcanoes, and its eruption has destroyed hundreds of homes and forced thousands to evacuate. But until now there had only been one serious injury,a man whose leg was hit by a projectile of molten rock as he sat on a balcony. Last week, scientists at the US Geological Survey said the flow of lava had created a new small  island.

"The lessons want to reduce the risk of teenagers getting involved in knife crime during the summer holidays Teenagers in England are being given lessons in school to reduce the risk of knife violence in the summer holidays. End-of-term activities might be expected to be sports days, school trips and concerts, but the Home Office is providing anti-knife lessons. They are telling young people not to believe the ""myth"" that it is safer for them to carry a knife. Crime Minister Victoria Atkins said young people need to be kept safe from the ""rise in serious violence"". With the end of term approaching, secondary schools are giving safety lessons from the Home Office designed to reduce the risk of stabbings during the long hot summer holidays. The lessons, for 11 to 16-year-olds, warn young people not to believe everything they see on social media, and that it is false to believe most other youngsters have knives or that carrying a knife is a form of self-defence. There have been many high-profile incidents involving young people and knife crime Teenagers are being told about how a culture of gangs, knives and violence could ruin their future, and how to resist peer pressure. The anti-knife lessons are being taught through personal, health and social education classes, with the Home Office providing information to 50,000 subject specialists. Knife crime increased by 22% last year in England and Wales, according to the Office for National Statistics, with almost 40,000 offences involving a knife or sharp instrument - and there has been a series of high-profile fatal stabbings involving young people, particularly in London. The House of Commons library published figures from hospitals last month showing more than 4,400 injuries from sharp objects last year needing to be treated by consultants - up by almost 22% compared with two years before. The lessons are meant to prevent the harm caused by knife violence The knife crime lessons are part of a wider Home Office strategy to deter young people from carrying knives, and to reduce acts of serious violence. ""The summer holidays can pose additional dangers to young people, which is why we are determined to do everything we can to keep them safe and give them the tools and resilience they need to enjoy the summer break,"" said Ms Atkins. Children's Minister Nadhim Zahawi backed the lessons, saying ""knife crime has devastating consequences"" and that children and families need to be protected from its threat.

"Usain Bolt has played in a number of exhibition matches this year Eight-time Olympic champion Usain Bolt is in talks for a trial to play football in Australia, a club says. The Jamaican former sprinter, 31, is negotiating a six-week stint with the Central Coast Mariners, a team in the country's A-League competition. Mariners chief executive Shaun Mielekamp said the club had spent four months pursuing Bolt, and a season-long deal could follow. Football agent Tony Rallis said a deal had been agreed ""in principle"". Mr Rallis, who has been involved in the deal, told local Sky Sports Radio that negotiations continued over Bolt's pay. ""The owner of Central Coast Mariners has put his hand deep in his pocket and guaranteed 70% of the salary,"" Mr Rallis said. News Corp Australia reported that a ""multi-million dollar"" deal had been proposed. Bolt has previously trained with clubs in Germany, Norway and South Africa. The 100m and 200m world record holder, who retired from athletics last year, has previously spoken about his interest in becoming a professional footballer. Bolt is a fan of Manchester United and one of its former assistant managers, Mike Phelan, is now at the Mariners. This video can not be played Usain Bolt trains with German side Borussia Dortmund A Football Federal Australia spokesman told the BBC that it would not assist in funding Bolt's trial. Mr Mielekamp said the club was optimistic that the trial could be extended. ""If all goes well, who knows? He may be lighting up the A-League this season,"" he told the local Seven Network on Tuesday. Mr Mielekamp said the club had received positive reports about Bolt's performance when he trained with German club Borussia Dortmund and Norwegian side Stromsgodset. Bolt trains with Norwegian side Usain Bolt in 9.58 charts Sprint star in Old Trafford debut ""The most important thing is we wait to find out and see how good a footballer he is first,"" Mr Mielekamp said.

"Guto Bebb was elected MP for Aberconwy in May 2010 A Welsh Conservative MP has quit as a minister in anger at concessions being given to Brexiteers by Theresa May. Guto Bebb resigned as minister for defence procurement in order to vote against the government on amendments it accepted to its Brexit Customs Bill. MPs voted 305 to 302 on Monday to back a changeRemainers said would undermine Mrs May's negotiating position. Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns said he was ""very sorry"" the Aberconwy MP felt he had to resign over the issue. Mr Bebb had staunchly defended the prime minister amid the turmoil which has followed the unveiling of her blueprint for post-Brexit relations with the EU. He brandedBoris Johnson's resignation as foreign secretary ""a selfish act""andattacked former Brexit Minister David Jonesfor criticising Mrs May's plan. Government scrapes through EU customs votes Airbus Brexit remarks criticised Brexit: All you need to know Mr Cairns told BBC Radio Wales he was ""going to miss"" Mr Bebb, who had served under him as a junior Wales Office minister. Speaking onGood Morning Wales, he said: ""Guto was an excellent minister and a close colleague and a good friend. ""I'm very sorry that he felt in order to vote last night that he needed to leave the government."" Alun Cairns and Guto Bebb had served together in the Wales Office Glyn Davies, Conservative MP for Montgomeryshire, said: ""I am very upset that Guto has felt the need to resign from the government. He is a good friend and was an outstanding minister. ""Guto is a man of deep principle. He is such a talented politician that I cannot believe he will not find another important role in the future."" Leave campaigner and Monmouth Conservative MP David Davies said he was ""sad to see him go"", adding: ""He's a friend and he was doing a really good job in the MoD [Ministry of Defence]. ""Guto is strong-minded though and in some ways I'm not surprised."" Mr Bebb was appointed minister for defence procurement in January 2018 after serving as parliamentary under secretary of state at the Wales Office and a government whip from March 2016. He was elected MP for Aberconwy in May 2010 and voted Remain in the 2016 EU referendum. This video can not be played David Jones said ""a lot more listening"" needed to be done by ministers The Customs Bill amendment was tabled by Brexiteer Tories and the government's backing of it sparked a backlash from pro-EU Tory MPs, who said the PM had ""capitulated"". But Downing Street, which agreed to accept the four amendments, said they were ""consistent"" with the White Paper where it sets out how it wants to trade with the EU in years to come. MPs backed the amendment that prevents the UK from collecting taxes on behalf of the EU unless the rest of the EU does the same for the UK. Applying EU tariffs to products destined for the EU is part of Mrs May's plan to avoid friction at UK borders after Brexit. Another amendment, to ensure the UK is out of the EU's VAT regime, was backed by 303 to 300. Clwyd West MP David Jones - a former Brexit minister and Welsh secretary who led the Vote Leave campaign in Wales - said the government was right to listen to its Brexiteer critics but believed ""a lot more listening"" needed to be done. Guto Bebb voted Remain in the Brexit referendum and it was no secret he had become increasingly frustrated by the actions of some of the Brexiteers in his party. He accused former Brexit Minister David Jones of sour grapes after he criticised the prime minister's plan for future trade with the EU. He also attacked senior cabinet ministers for ""inflammatory"" and ""unworthy"" comments after then-Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said threats from business over Brexit were ""inappropriate"". But after a string of resignations by Brexiteers, Guto Bebb's decision to leave a job he obviously enjoyed has surprised many. What may seem strange is that he resigned so he could vote for what was the prime minister's own position a few hours earlier.

"The UK heatwave has led to much talk of whether there will be hosepipe bans, although so far onlyNorthern Ireland Waterhas introduced one. But do they work? The answer is that they probably do, although the reductions in water demand tend not to be huge. There's been some research into the effectiveness of hosepipe bans, particularly looking at the widespread bans in 2006 and 2012. The problem with 2012 was that the restrictions were introduced in early April - but almost immediately heavy rain set in, which led to extensive flooding. The problems with enforcing a ban when there are flood warnings in place, together with the fact that people would be considerably less likely to use hosepipes to water their gardens or fill swimming pools during a period of heavy rain, mean that 2012 was not really a representative example. Incidentally, the water companies no longer call them hosepipe bans - they were replaced in 2010 bytemporary use bans (Tubs),external, which cover almost anything you might consider doing at home with a hosepipe, such as cleaning a patio, washing a car, filling an ornamental fountain and even cleaning a private leisure boat. The idea of a hosepipe ban is to reduce the level of water consumption to winter levels. Joint research by the universities ofManchester, Edinburgh, Southampton and Lancaster,externalin 2014 suggested that fewer than 20% of people with gardens ever used a hosepipe to water it. The Energy Saving Trust estimates that of the average 142 litres (284 pints) of water used per person per day,only about 1% goes on the garden and 1% on the car,external. On the other hand, running a hosepipe for an hour uses about 1,000 litres of water, so it doesn't take many people watering the garden every day with a hose to add up to a considerable amount of water. A report by UK Water Industry Research,externalfound an 18% fall in consumption in 2012, although that did not take into account the impact of the weather. As mentioned, you would expect people to use less water, especially outdoors, if it's raining. A report prepared for the Environment Agency,externaldid take account of the wet weather when it looked at the impact of the restrictions. It found that in 2012 there was not a statistically significant reduction in water usage after the introduction of the Tub. But it also looked at 2006 when, it found, there had been a fall of about 10% in usage, which was statistically significant, although it was not possible to demonstrate conclusively that this was due to the restrictions. Rob Lawson, from Artesia Consulting, told BBC Reality Check that water consumption in a dry summer typically increased by about 10%-25% compared with winter but this could be as high as 40%-50% in specific areas for short periods during heatwaves such as the one we are experiencing at the moment. A hosepipe ban is not the first measure taken by water companies - their first step is to call for restraint in the use of water. Severn Trent, United Utilities and Southern Waterare currently encouraging their customers to take steps such as taking shorter showers and not using unattended hosepipes. If a Tub does not save enough water, then further restrictions may be imposed such as non-essential use drought orders, which restrict non-domestic water use, preventing companies and local authorities from using hoses to clean windows, water plants and fill fountains and swimming pools, for example. A drought order would also stop golf courses using mains water to keep their grass green, although it would not prevent them using water from lakes or boreholes on the courses. Water companies have to produce drought plans, which outline what steps they would take to deal with water shortages, some of which include estimates for how much water would be saved. Thames Water's drought plan,externalincludes estimates of how much water each step it takes will save. It predicts the biggest savings (between 7% and 10% in summer) will come from a media campaign together with a ban on unattended hoses and sprinklers, which could be imposed before a Tub, although other water companies consider it as part of a Tub. A full hosepipe ban would then save another 3%-4%, the company predicts. United Utilities' drought plan,externalsays: ""The savings associated with a campaign for voluntary water use restraint has been estimated to be 3%-5% of the average dry weather demand expected during the drought period. This is based on the experience of hosepipe bans introduced by us in 1995-96 and 2010."" Anglian Water estimates,externalthe savings from just hosepipe restrictions at between 5% and 7%. Southern Water says,externalthat a ban on unattended hosepipes and sprinklers would reduce demand by about 2.5% while a full hosepipe ban would save another 5%.

"Parts of Wayoh Reservoir, at Edgworth near Bolton, have dried up Water is being moved from Wales to boost depleted supplies across north-west England, amid warnings of an ""imminent"" hosepipe ban in the region. Reservoir levels have dropped during the heatwave, with those in Greater Manchester particularly affected, United Utilities (UU) said. The company said there had been a ""massive increase"" in demand for water. Supplies from the Lake District and Pennines are also being drawn upon to help ease the shortage. UU said it was struggling to process water quickly enough to meet high demand, while parts of Wayoh Reservoir, at Edgworth near Bolton, have completely dried up. The company said it was providing an additional half a billion litres of water a day above what it normally supplies to customers. A fuller Wayoh Reservoir While Greater Manchester has been a particular problem area, UU said the whole region was now at risk of a hosepipe ban ""in days rather than weeks"" if things did not improve. A spokesman said: ""Wayoh tells the story of the prolonged heatwave. ""Greater Manchester is served from various water sources, at present we are using our integrated regional water network moving water from North Wales, the Lakes and the Pennines to keep taps flowing. ""The prolonged hot weather means the region's reservoir stores have decreased since last week, with some reservoirs looking more dramatic than others. ""We are still encouraging our customers to voluntarily use water efficiently, by avoiding the use of water-hungry devices, particularly outside in the garden. ""A hosepipe ban could be imminent. If we can't bring the demand down for water, that would be the next logical step, and that could be in days rather than weeks.""
