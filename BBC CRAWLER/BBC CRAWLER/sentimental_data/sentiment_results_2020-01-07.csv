"This video can not be played Derek Mackay says a delay to the UK budget could have ""profound consequences"" for Scotland UK government plans for a March budget are ""disrespectful to devolution"" and could have ""profound consequences"" for Scotland, Derek Mackay has warned. Chancellor Sajid Javid has announced he will set out his tax and spending plans on 11 March. Scottish ministers want to see these plans before drawing up their own, but will now have little time to do so. Mr Mackay, the Scottish finance secretary, said the move was ""really disrespectful"" to Holyrood. Scottish councils need to set their budgets by 11 March, and local government umbrella body Cosla has written to Mr Javid warning of ""catastrophic risks"" to local services. A date for the Scottish budget will be announced in due course, with Mr Mackay in talks with other parties and the Scottish Fiscal Commission about how to respond to these ""exceptional circumstances"". Live: MSPs ask 'urgent questions' on budget row 'Infrastructure revolution' in March Budget Mr Mackay was originally due to set out his budget plans on 12 December, but that wasdelayed because of the snap general electionwhich was held on that date. He wants to see the details of Mr Javid's budget before he sets out his own plans, given the impact of UK finances on the Scottish budget. He told BBC Scotland: ""We may have clarity over a date, but we don't have clarity over the numbers that might compose a budget."" He added: ""This is really disrespectful to devolution, to Scotland's parliament and people, in setting a UK budget so late. ""It shows the UK government hasn't considered devolution, hasn't considered our agreements or the impact on Scotland's public services, not least local government. Those are profound consequences."" Chancellor Sajid Javid will deliver the UK government's Budget on 11 March Mr Mackay added: ""The failure of the UK government to publish its budget at an earlier time means we do not have clarity on the funding available for our schools, hospitals and other vital public services. Despite this, we remain focused on introducing a Scottish budget for 2020-21 at the earliest practical opportunity."" During Treasury questions at Westminster, Mr Javid was accused by SNP Treasury spokeswoman Alison Thewliss of giving ""absolutely no thought to Scotland at all"". The Chancellor replied: ""In the election we've just had we talked time and time again about the need to unleash the entire UK, and of course that includes all of Scotland. ""Where Scotland has been let down time and time again is by the SNP government - which is giving Scottish people the highest taxes in the UK and the worst set of public services."" A Treasury spokesman later added: ""Nothing stops the Scottish Parliament from passing their budget before the UK budget. We are working with the Scottish government as part of an agreed process to provide the information they need to prepare their budget."" Despite fiscal powers including income tax being devolved to Holyrood, the UK budget process still has a huge bearing on the Scottish one. To start with, how much the UK government spends on each department has implications for the block grant - the package of funding allocated to Holyrood via the Barnett Formula. The forecasts of tax revenues from the Office for Budget Responsibility - which come out alongside the budget - also have a bearing on the block grant, as they form part of the calculations underpinning the devolved tax system. There is also the issue of the gap between the Scottish and UK tax systems - if Mr Javid decided, for example, to cut the higher rate of tax, Mr Mackay would have to decide whether to follow suit, or widen the gulf between what higher earners pay north and south of the border. He contends that he cannot make an informed decision until he has seen the full picture. Unlike at Westminster, there is actually a hard deadline on the Scottish budget process - the end of the current financial year. Unless a ""rate resolution"" setting out income tax rates and bands is passed by 1 April, the devolved income tax system ceases to apply. The rulebook as it stands doesn't provide for this happening. The Chartered Institute of Taxation says it would see Scotland ""effectively foregoing its ability to set its own income tax rates"". There are other practical hurdles too, such as drawing up and passing a Budget Bill. Normally this process stretches out over a period of months, with each Holyrood committee carrying out scrutiny of spending on their particular portfolio and MSPs holding debates in the chamber. This year, the parliamentary part of the process might have to be pushed through in a matter of days - leaving little time for scrutiny or deal-making between parties. Mr Javid's chosen date for his budget, 11 March, is also the legal deadline for Scottish councils to set their local tax rates. Council leaders are concerned that they will have to set these rates ""blind"", due to a knock-on effect of MSPs not knowing how much money they can allocate to local authorities, because they don't know how much money they have to work with. Cosla's resources spokeswoman Gail Macgregor - a Conservative councillor - said a March UK budget ""runs the risk of delaying the Scottish government's budget"". She added: ""This significantly impedes the ability for local authorities to formulate their own budgets, meaning Scotland's communities are disadvantaged"". Glasgow City Council leader Susan Aitken said the UK government ""has given not a single passing thought to Scottish public services"", while Dundee's John Alexander said the timing was ""beyond ridiculous"". It is theoretically possible for Mr Mackay to set his budget before the UK government one comes out, although the Fraser of Allander Institute think-tankhas called this approach ""risky"",externalgiven the potential for last-minute changes. The UK government has insisted that it can give Mr Mackay enough information to set his budget any time he likes. He replies that there has been ""absolutely no engagement"" to make this possible. Ultimately the deadline of the tax rate resolution means the matter must be settled by the end of March, but Scottish government officials point to the March 11 deadline for councils as equally important. They are considering a range of possible responses, including potentially changing the law to give councils more time to set budgets. There could be a middle route, where the Treasury gives Scottish officials enough ballpark information to draw up the bulk of their plans. This could in turn be passed on to councils, so they can set their tax rates, with the formal work of actually passing the budget bill at Holyrood put off until after Mr Javid makes everything official in March. However, the truncated timetable will also add extra pressure to the annual issue of whether the minority SNP administration can strike a deal with opposition parties to actually pass a budget bill.

"South Western Railway's auditor said there was ""significant doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern"" A rail firm has said it could lose its franchise after declaring a Â£137m loss. South Western Railway (SWR) said it was in talks with the government over the future of the contract, which is due to expire in 2024. The operator, owned by FirstGroup and Hong Kong-based firm MTR, said it had been affected by issues including strikes and infrastructure reliability. SWR services were disrupted for 27 days in December by the latest in a series of strikes over the future of guards. RMT union members have staged a series of strikes over the future of guards SWR's accounts,external, for the year ending 31 March 2019, showed a loss after tax of Â£136.9m. It said talks with the DfT could lead to a new contract or ""termination of the [current] contract within the next 12 months"". SWR said its owners had set aside funds for the ""maximum unavoidable loss"". A spokesman for the train operating company said: ""SWR's recent performance has been affected by issues including infrastructure reliability, timetabling delays and industrial action. ""We continue to be in ongoing and constructive discussions with the DfT."" The RMT rail union said the firm should be stripped of the franchise immediately to avoid a ""chaotic collapse"". RMT members have been involved in more than two years of strikes over a move by SWR to allow drivers to operate train doors. By Paul Clifton, BBC South transport correspondent SWR has not been balancing the books for some time. After two years of strikes by guards in the RMT union, that isn't a surprise. New trains are late, the infrastructure has been unreliable and performance has been falling for years. This railway is not doing well and most of its promises to passengers have not been met. But here, in black and white for the first time, is an acknowledgment by the new managing director, Mark Hopwood, that the company could fail. Operations could be transferred to a government controlled body. I don't think it's the most likely outcome. A new deal with revised terms is more likely. But what's clear is that the option of last resort is being actively considered. A DfT spokesperson said: ""We monitor the financial health of all our franchises closely and we expect them to meet their contractual obligations. ""The government will shortly bring forward a White Paper containing reforms recommended by the Williams Review that will put passengers first, end the complicated franchising model and simplify fares."" SWR operates routes between London Waterloo, Reading, Bristol, Exeter, Weymouth, and Portsmouth, as well as Island Line on the Isle of Wight. FirstGroup and MTR were awarded the franchise in August 2017, after outbidding previous operator Stagecoach.

"This video can not be played Trump - We took action to stop, not start a war US President Donald Trump's decision to authorise a drone strike that killed Iran's most powerful military commander has seen tensions between the two nations escalate. What's the strategy here, and what might happen next? Mr Trump has long promised to take American troops out of the Middle East. But under his presidency, US relations with Iran have become more tense as he has ramped up sanctions and pulled out of a nuclear deal he viewed as flawed. Here's what US foreign policy experts believe may be behind the decision to kill Qasem Soleimani and what it means for US-Iran relations. PJ Crowley is a former US Assistant Secretary of State and author of Red Line: American Foreign Policy in a Time of Fractured Politics and Failing States. Why now? We had the attack by the Iranian-backed militia and the response against its compounds in Iraq and Syria. The Trump administration was surprised by the magnitude of the attack on the embassy in Baghdad, viewed it as an escalation and believed that Soleimani was behind it. Presented with a target of opportunity, the president authorised the strike. What's Trump's strategy? Donald Trump is not a grand strategist. He lives in the moment and acts by instinct. I would be surprised if he thought through the after-effects. He was presented with the opportunity to take out a ""bad hombre"" that Obama hadn't. That was probably all he needed to hear. What next? Iran has promised to respond and has lots of proxies that will look for targets of opportunity across the region. They understand enough about American politics to know that the key to Trump's re-election campaign is the US economy. If they can disrupt it, they will. In theory, the Trump endgame is forcing Iran back to the bargaining table for a ""better deal"" that takes into account not just Iran's nuclear ambitions, but its missile program and regional behaviour as well. This video can not be played Qasem Soleimani: Who was Iran's 'rock star' general? It's implausible to see how this moves us closer to negotiations. Secretary of State Pompeo is dreaming when he says we are going to be widely applauded across the region. In Jerusalem and Riyadh yes, but the rest of the region is holding its breath. What about his promises to leave the Middle East? The president has never resolved the inherent contradiction within his Iran policy. He wants to exert maximum pressure while attempting to extract the United States from the region. While the president has consistently criticised Middle East wars with nothing to show for them, he has taken an action that at least in the short-term increases the risk that the existing political and economic conflict between Iran and the United States will escalate into a shooting war. 'Sorry Iran', escalation fears and other US reaction Why the US had Soleimani in its sights Why kill Soleimani now and what happens next? William Tobey is a senior fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, and the former Deputy Administrator for Defense Nuclear Non-proliferation at the National Nuclear Security Administration. Why now? The timing is probably reflective of the fact that the maximum pressure campaign has been surprisingly effective. Tehran has chosen to escalate from the economic dimension to the military dimension, first with strikes against oil tankers and facilities and later against contractors. One could see this as an attempt to close off that channel for escalation, to tell Tehran: ""Look, that's not going to work for you."" This video can not be played Feeling the squeeze: Iran sanctions explained What's Trump's strategy? He's pursuing a tricky policy - to apply so much pressure that Iran feels that it has literally no choice but to return to the negotiating table and have a better deal, but not so much pressure that Iran thinks that there's no chance that the US will actually either adhere to a deal or even strike a deal that would be tolerable to them. In some ways, you see the stick - with the attack on the Soleimani convoy -  but a carrot by the president saying: ""Look I don't want to have war with Iran."" He's trying to hold open the possibility that he doesn't see unlimited conflict as a constructive path. What next? Iran has seen staggering inflation rates and devaluation of their currency. Having fought a losing battle on the economic sanctions front, they decided to open a new front - Military strikes. I have a belief that nation states that feel like they're either aggrieved or attacked become more risk-tolerant. Protests have also taken place outside Iran - here in Pakistan We've certainly seen a high risk-tolerance by the government in Tehran...I suspect their willingness to take further risks will increase. So the question is, which will end first - the maximum pressure campaign or Tehran's ability to resist it? Iran's response options for Soleimani's death Iran's network of influence in Mid-East 'growing' Luke Coffey is the Director of the Allison Center for Foreign Policy at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think-tank based in Washington DC, a US Army veteran and a former special adviser at the UK Ministry of Defence. Why now? I think every person has a limit. When you look at everything that Iran has been doing over the past year... I think it's clear that Iran was trying to provoke some sort of response from the US. This video can not be played Gen Soleimani was a popular figure in Iran Trump, because he's not very military interventionist, was trying to avoid this situation. I suspect that he's been presented this option in the past and has rejected it, and then this week he decided enough is enough. He's continued to say he wants to have a negotiated settlement with Iran with no conditions for talks. Trump reached a point where he had to push back. Your questions: Will Soleimani killing spark war? A brief history of US-Iran relations What's Trump's strategy? The maximum pressure campaign is the strategy - the administration has been very consistent on this. Trump's shown he's trying to get the Iranians back to the negotiating table and I think he's trying to do so with the least amount of military kinetic action. I think Trump does see himself as this great negotiator and wanted to be the one to cut the deal, but was painted into this corner because Iran kept ratcheting their side of the pressure. Protests are taking place in Iran - what will the wider repercussions be? You don't just wake up one morning and decide to kill Qasem Soleimani. There had to have been interagency planning in terms of tracking his whereabouts, finding windows of opportunity. We should not forget that Qasem Soleimani [was] a combatant inside a combat zone. No doubt that if the Iranians had the opportunity to take out someone similar in the US, they'd do so. This is part of the drumbeat of conflict that we're stuck with in the Middle East. I don't think this is going to spiral over to become World War Three. What next? Iran's definitely not going to come to the table now. That wasn't a reason not to do the strike - frankly, Soleimani had it coming to him and he got it. He has the blood of American soldiers on his hands and has terrorised huge chunks of the Middle East for more than a decade. Just because Trump wanted to have talks with Iran doesn't mean he shouldn't have taken out Soleimani. This video can not be played Hundreds of US troops arrive in Kuwait - thousands more could be deployed to the region I don't think he did it with politics in mind, I think he wanted to avoid this situation or he would've done it earlier. But politically speaking for him this makes him look like a strong leader among his supporters. What about his promises to leave the Middle East? Trump barely likes US troops in Germany, so the idea that he's going to put US troops in Iran in an election year is, I think, inconceivable. But he has to also show the US is only going to be pushed around so much. Who was Iran's Qasem Soleimani? Why kill Soleimani now and what happens next? How sanctions affect Iran... in five objects.

"President Trump said Soleimani was plotting imminent attacks on American diplomats US President Donald Trump ordered the drone strike that killed Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani in Iraq but what are the legal grounds for this course of action? The US said: ""This strike was aimed at deterring future Iranian attack plans."" So, what are the key issues when considering its legality, according to international law? The relevant law in the UN Charter allows for a state to act in self-defence ""if an armed attack occurs"". But this definition tends to be interpreted by governments, say legal experts. ""In the Soleimani case, the US is claiming it acted in self-defence to prevent imminent attacks, a category of action which, if in fact true, is generally seen as being permissible under the UN Charter,"" says Dapo Akande, professor of public international law at Oxford University and co-director of the Oxford Institute for Ethics, Law and Armed Conflict (ELAC). But Agnes Callamard, UN special rapporteur on extra-judicial killings. has tweeted about the strike saying ""this test is unlikely to be met"". Allow Twitter content?

A2010 UN report on ""targeted killings"",externalsaid there was a weighty body of scholarship that viewed the self-defence argument as having the right to use force ""against a real and imminent threat when the necessity of that self-defence is instant, overwhelming, and leaving no choice of means, and no moment of deliberation."" Who was Iran's Qasem Soleimani? Will his killing spark war and more of your questions Iran's response options for Soleimani's death Does Trump have a strategy? Theinitial US Department of Defense statement,externalomitted the word ""imminent"" and said the strike was aimed at deterring future Iranian attacks and that Iran's top military leader Soleimani was ""actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region"". In later statements, US officials including President Trump said Soleimani had been plotting ""imminent attacks"". Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic Party candidate for the US presidency, said: ""The administration cannot keep its story straight."" The legality of the strike under international law may well depend on the US providing evidence of those future attacks, according to Mr Akande. The US government has not yet shared details publicly, but the administration has said intelligence has been shared with key figures in the US Congress. Asked by a journalist on 7 January for more details about imminent threats, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo notedthe incidents leading up to the strike, but did not provide any evidence of impending attacks. There are other justifications it has used in the past, according to Dr Ralph Wilde, an expert in public international law at University College London. ""Since 9/11 the US has taken a view that self-defence can be justified to prevent more longer-term attacks. When the attack is being planned, but is not imminent. The Obama administration used this argument to justify drone strikes."" Obama defends 'just' drones war This video can not be played Mourners packed the streets in Tehran - and Iran's supreme leader wept as he led prayers The other issue is whether the US had consent from Iraq to carry out the strike there. Iraqi MPs reacted angrily and passed a non-binding resolution calling for US troops to leave the country. The Iraqi government has called it a ""brazen violation of Iraq's sovereignty"". US forces had been invited into Iraq to fight the Islamic State group and to train Iraqi forces. The US might argue this invitation constituted some form of consent, giving them a right to protect their interests and personnel inside Iraq. But Mr Akande argues that, in practice, the terms of the agreement to host US forces would not stretch to carrying out an attack like this. Persepolis is one of Iran's most famous cultural sites On Sunday, Mr Trump tweeted, warning the US would target sites that were ""important to Iran and the Iranian culture"" if American assets were hit. The Iran Foreign Minister, Javad Zarif said an attack on a cultural site would amount to a war crime. Trump's threat ""shows callous disregard for the global rule of law"", said Andrea Prasow of Human Rights Watch. The US government insisted it would behave lawfully. Allow Twitter content?

But an attack on a cultural site would violate several international treaties. The 1954 Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property safeguarded cultural sites in the wake of the destruction of cultural heritage sites during World War Two, and was signed by the US. In 2017, the UN passed a resolution in response to the Islamic State attacks which condemned ""the unlawful destruction of cultural heritage, including the destruction of religious sites and artefacts"". The US was among the harshest critics of the IS destruction of historic site of Palmyra in Syria in 2015, as well as the Taliban's demolition of the Bamiyan Buddhas in Afghanistan in 2001. In 2016, the International Criminal Court (ICC) convicted someone for the destruction of cultural heritage for the first time, after an extremist linked to Al-Qaeda destroyed religious artefacts in Mali. The US is not part of the ICC but it is a signatory of other agreements to protect cultural property and any attack would represent a significant reversal.

"President Trump said Soleimani was plotting imminent attacks on American diplomats US President Donald Trump ordered the drone strike that killed Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani in Iraq but what are the legal grounds for this course of action? The US said: ""This strike was aimed at deterring future Iranian attack plans."" So, what are the key issues when considering its legality, according to international law? The relevant law in the UN Charter allows for a state to act in self-defence ""if an armed attack occurs"". But this definition tends to be interpreted by governments, say legal experts. ""In the Soleimani case, the US is claiming it acted in self-defence to prevent imminent attacks, a category of action which, if in fact true, is generally seen as being permissible under the UN Charter,"" says Dapo Akande, professor of public international law at Oxford University and co-director of the Oxford Institute for Ethics, Law and Armed Conflict (ELAC). But Agnes Callamard, UN special rapporteur on extra-judicial killings. has tweeted about the strike saying ""this test is unlikely to be met"". Allow Twitter content?

A2010 UN report on ""targeted killings"",externalsaid there was a weighty body of scholarship that viewed the self-defence argument as having the right to use force ""against a real and imminent threat when the necessity of that self-defence is instant, overwhelming, and leaving no choice of means, and no moment of deliberation."" Who was Iran's Qasem Soleimani? Will his killing spark war and more of your questions Iran's response options for Soleimani's death Does Trump have a strategy? Theinitial US Department of Defense statement,externalomitted the word ""imminent"" and said the strike was aimed at deterring future Iranian attacks and that Iran's top military leader Soleimani was ""actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region"". In later statements, US officials including President Trump said Soleimani had been plotting ""imminent attacks"". Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic Party candidate for the US presidency, said: ""The administration cannot keep its story straight."" The legality of the strike under international law may well depend on the US providing evidence of those future attacks, according to Mr Akande. The US government has not yet shared details publicly, but the administration has said intelligence has been shared with key figures in the US Congress. Asked by a journalist on 7 January for more details about imminent threats, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo notedthe incidents leading up to the strike, but did not provide any evidence of impending attacks. There are other justifications it has used in the past, according to Dr Ralph Wilde, an expert in public international law at University College London. ""Since 9/11 the US has taken a view that self-defence can be justified to prevent more longer-term attacks. When the attack is being planned, but is not imminent. The Obama administration used this argument to justify drone strikes."" Obama defends 'just' drones war This video can not be played Mourners packed the streets in Tehran - and Iran's supreme leader wept as he led prayers The other issue is whether the US had consent from Iraq to carry out the strike there. Iraqi MPs reacted angrily and passed a non-binding resolution calling for US troops to leave the country. The Iraqi government has called it a ""brazen violation of Iraq's sovereignty"". US forces had been invited into Iraq to fight the Islamic State group and to train Iraqi forces. The US might argue this invitation constituted some form of consent, giving them a right to protect their interests and personnel inside Iraq. But Mr Akande argues that, in practice, the terms of the agreement to host US forces would not stretch to carrying out an attack like this. Persepolis is one of Iran's most famous cultural sites On Sunday, Mr Trump tweeted, warning the US would target sites that were ""important to Iran and the Iranian culture"" if American assets were hit. The Iran Foreign Minister, Javad Zarif said an attack on a cultural site would amount to a war crime. Trump's threat ""shows callous disregard for the global rule of law"", said Andrea Prasow of Human Rights Watch. The US government insisted it would behave lawfully. Allow Twitter content?

But an attack on a cultural site would violate several international treaties. The 1954 Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property safeguarded cultural sites in the wake of the destruction of cultural heritage sites during World War Two, and was signed by the US. In 2017, the UN passed a resolution in response to the Islamic State attacks which condemned ""the unlawful destruction of cultural heritage, including the destruction of religious sites and artefacts"". The US was among the harshest critics of the IS destruction of historic site of Palmyra in Syria in 2015, as well as the Taliban's demolition of the Bamiyan Buddhas in Afghanistan in 2001. In 2016, the International Criminal Court (ICC) convicted someone for the destruction of cultural heritage for the first time, after an extremist linked to Al-Qaeda destroyed religious artefacts in Mali. The US is not part of the ICC but it is a signatory of other agreements to protect cultural property and any attack would represent a significant reversal.

"Further potential victims of ""an evil serial sexual predator who preyed upon young men"" have come forward following his sentencing, police have said. Reynhard Sinaga lured 48 men from outside Manchester clubs to his flat, where he drugged and assaulted them. On Monday, he was jailed for life with a 30-year minimum for 159 sex offences, including 136 rapes. Police said a dedicated incident room for reporting sexual abuse has seen ""a very positive response"". A spokesman for Greater Manchester Police said: ""For operational reasons we are unable to give out specific numbers of calls made to the incident room or information made online via the Major Incident Public Portal at this time. ""However, we can confirm that some of these reports relate to potential further victims of Sinaga."" Police say they have evidence Sinaga assaulted at least 190 victims, but many have not been identified Sinaga would wait for men leaving nightclubs and bars before leading them to his flat in Montana House, Princess Street, often with the offer of somewhere to have a drink or call a taxi. He drugged his victims before assaulting them while they were unconscious, and filmed the attacks. When the victims woke up many of them had no memory of what had happened. This video can not be played ""Talking about male rape will help victims step forward"" Survivors Manchester, a charity that helps male survivors of sexual abuse, said the case ""generates the ability to talk"" about abuse. Chief executive Duncan Craig said: ""There are people ringing up who are not directly affected by this particular case, but are people who have been sexually assaulted, maybe even in childhood that are now feeling like the time is right to step forward and talk. ""It's something that we don't do enough of."" By Judith Moritz, BBC north of England correspondent It was only when I listened to their individual stories in court that I began to understand the trauma experienced by Sinaga's victims. The anguish of a student who'd dropped out of university as a result. Another who'd left his job. A third whose relationship had broken down. One who couldn't bring himself to talk about what happened to his family. And distressingly, another whose pain is so great, it drove him to contemplate suicide. The publicity surrounding the case yesterday has been hard for them to endure. The media jointly agreed not to report it until after the Christmas break so that counselling services were fully in place for victims before it was made public. Helplines set up for people affected have received multiple calls including some from potential victims. Sinaga's convictions relate to crimes he committed from January 2015 to June 2017, but police believe he began offending years earlier. Police say they have evidence the 36-year-old targeted at least 190 victims, but they have been unable to identify a further 70 victims and are now appealing for anyone who believes they may have been abused by Sinaga to come forward. The Crown Prosecution Service said Sinaga was ""the most prolific rapist in British legal history"" ashe was jailed at Manchester Crown Court on Monday.

"The fleet of 44 new trains will run between Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle and Edinburgh TransPennine Express is to give season ticket holders a rebate that cancels out the annual fare increase after disruption to rail services. The firm's managing director, Leo Goodwin, said the firm's performance was ""not up to scratch"". The Department for Transport said the rail firm's performance in recent weeks had been ""completely unacceptable"". Cancellations on routes in the north-east of England will continue until the end of January, the firm has said. The firm has been trying to introduce new trains and implement staff training, but blamed delays to these on maintenance and infrastructure issues. A number of trains between Leeds and Edinburgh, stopping at Chester-le-Street, Durham, Darlington, Morpeth and Newcastle, have been cut. TransPennine Express said on Monday that customers who held a season ticket between 1 October and 31 December 2019 ""will be eligible for a 3% rebate, which will more than cover the 2.8% average increase on regulated fares"". Mr Goodwin said: ""We know that our performance was not up to scratch at the end of last year and for this, we really do apologise.  We have experienced a number of issues following the introduction of our new trains, resulting in disruption to a number of our customers journeys with us. ""I would like to thank our customers for continuing to travel with us and it is only right that we compensate them for the recent disruption."" The Nova fleet promises more luggage storage, extra plug sockets and free wi-fi A spokesperson for the Department for Transport said: ""TransPennine Express' performance in recent weeks has been completely unacceptable. ""We understand how deeply frustrating this is for passengers, who should not have to put up with continued poor performance, and we will not tolerate continued significant reductions to services."" Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has ""demanded immediate explanations from the operator, Network Rail and rolling stock manufacturers, and will be convening an urgent meeting to determine how they will improve services for passengers,"" the spokesperson added. If a rail firm is falling down on its contractual obligations, the Department for Transport can take measures ranging from demanding remedial action to taking the franchise over. ""We have been clear with the operator that they must take urgent steps to address their poor performance problems and, if appropriate, we will take action under the terms set out in the franchise agreement,"" the spokesperson said. ""Trains must run on time"" has been a mantra of the Transport Secretary since he took up his post in the summer. The opposite has been true on parts of the UK's railways so far this winter. It's been chaotic on West Midlands Railway and London North Western Railway - both of which are run by West Midlands Trains. Passengers on that network had a torrid time in the autumn and say things have only slightly improved since then. Season ticket holders there have already been given a rebate so their fares don't increase this year. Andy Street, the West Midlands Mayor, has given the company an ultimatum to get its house in order by the end of this month. South Western Railway is also under pressure to deliver a more punctual service. And then there is the case of Northern. That company's future hangs in the balance. One theme is a tendency by train companies to try and deliver overly-ambitious timetables which they are ultimately unable to deliver. Train companies have to try and live up to commitments they made to government under their franchising agreements. But the franchising system of today is now widely seen as far too rigid and that's why the government's rail review will soon announce deep reform to the structures that underpin our railways today. A number of rail operators have either offered refunds or pledged to improve performance recently. South Western Railway, which like TransPennine Express is owned by transport giant First Group, pledged on Monday to increase the number of trains running on time. Mark Hopwood, managing director of South Western Railway, said: ""I know it's been a very tough couple of years for everyone who uses South Western Railway. ""I also know that the recent strikes have had a very significant impact on our passengers and employees and I am determined to find a resolution."" In December, West Midlands Trains said passengerswould not pay the season ticket fare riseafter a ""drop in performance"". Rail operators have been under pressure from Mr Shapps over their performance since he took over the role in July.

"The teenager had a list of weapons he wanted to buy The youngest person to be convicted of planning a terror attack in the UK has been detained for more than six years. The now 17-year-old wrote about an ""inevitable race war"" in his diary and listed locations from his home city of Durham in a ""guerrilla warfare"" manual. A jury had found the boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, guilty of preparation of terrorist acts between October 2017 and March 2018. He was sentenced to six years and eight months at Manchester Crown Court. Judge David Stockdale QC told the boy: ""These are offences of the utmost seriousness."" The teenager drew up a ""hit list"" of areas he wanted to attack He also ordered the detention be followed by an extension period on licence of five years. Thesix-week trial heard he was an adherent of ""occult neo-Nazism"", and described himself as a ""natural sadist"". His attack preparations included researching explosives and trying to obtain the dangerous chemical ammonium nitrate. He also wrote of planning to carry out an arson spree targeting synagogues in the Durham area using Molotov cocktails. The teenager was flanked by a guard during the hearing Addressing the defendant, the judge described him as a widely-read ""young man of high intellect"", adding this made it a matter of ""infinite regret"" that he had persisted on ""such a twisted and - many would say sick - ideological path"". He said the evidence in the trial ""tells its own macabre story"", and while his young age was a powerful mitigating factor, it was also a ""most disturbing"" aspect of the case. ""You suffer from an autistic spectrum disorder"", he told him, saying it was common ground between experts. The judge also said the teenager had written him a letter expressing ""remorse"". Teen neo-Nazi became 'living dead' As well as being found guilty of preparation of terrorist acts, he was also convicted of disseminating a terrorist publication, possessing an article for a purpose connected with terrorism and three counts of possessing a document or record containing information likely to be useful to a terrorist. His trial heard he had visited websites on firearms and was in communication with a gun auctioneer. After his arrest in March 2019, police found him in possession of instructions showing to make bombs and ricin - and that he had distributed firearms manuals online by uploading them to a neo-Nazi website. The boy had started writing a ""guerrilla warfare"" manual Earlier in the sentencing hearing, prosecutor Michelle Nelson QC described it as ""a gamut of offending across the terrorism legislation"". Mitigating, Nigel Evans QC said the teenager's lack of contrition may be ""interpreted as part of his autism, his ADHD"", and his parents, who previously ""didn't believe anything was wrong"", were ""now fully engaged"". Speaking after sentencing, Det Ch Supt Martin Snowden from Durham Police said: ""It is never an easy decision to investigate, to arrest and prosecute children of this age. ""We only do this when we think it is the last resort for us to go down that line. ""Prevention is always better than prosecution - we would have always preferred to engage earlier and divert him away from these beliefs and this activity.""

"Children living at Quarriers homes were among those abused Children in homes run by Quarriers, Aberlour Child Care Trust, and Barnardo's suffered physical, emotional and sexual abuse, the Scottish Child Abuse Inquiry has concluded. Lady Smith, who is chairing the inquiry, said children who were at the institutions between 1921 and 1991 lived in ""harsh, rigid regimes"". She also said ""scant regard was paid to their dignity"". Quarriers, Aberlour and Barnardo's have apologised for the abuse suffered. In her findings,external, Lady Smith said: ""Many children did not find the warmth, care, and compassionate comfort they needed. ""The previous lives of the children who came into the care of the QAB (Quarriers, Aberlour and Barnardo's) providers had all been blighted in some way, whether by being abused in the family home, the death of one or more parent, parental illness, families who could not cope with caring for them, abandonment, or by other similar circumstances. ""The QAB providers could have made a real and positive difference to every child, but that did not happen. For many, further damage was inflicted upon them."" Quarriers admits child migration was wrong Quarriers 'brothers and sisters' remembered Childhood abuse payouts for 200 survivors The inquiry heard evidence from 110 witnesses during the third phase of the inquiry, which lasted 43 days from October 2018 to February 2019. It considered evidence about the nature and extent of abuse of children in care at institutions run by the QAB providers at locations across Scotland. The inquiry also examined any systems, policies and procedures in place and how they were applied. Lady Smith added: ""The QAB providers now recognise and accept that there was widespread abuse of children in their establishments. They have all apologised for it. ""A particularly frank and clear apology was offered on behalf of Quarriers by their current chief executive. Counsel for Barnardo's and for Aberlour indicated that those providers, having heard evidence in this case study, also tendered their apologies."" Children at the Smyllum Park Orphanage were sexually abused and beaten with leather straps, hairbrushes and crucifixes The first phase of the inquiry looked at children under the care of the Daughters of Charity of St Vincent de Paul between 1917 and 1981, with a particular focus on Smyllum Park Orphanage, Lanark, and Bellevue Children's Home in Rutherglen. It found that children at Smyllum Park orphanage weresexually abused and beaten with leather straps, hairbrushes and crucifixesand that the homes were places of fear, threat, and excessive discipline. Lady Smith said the children found ""no love, no compassion, no dignity and no comfort"". Lady Smith said Nazareth House orphanages were places of fear, hostility and confusion The second phase concentrated on homes run by the Sisters of Nazareth in Aberdeen, Cardonald, Lasswade and Kilmarnock between 1933 and 1984. It concluded that some children at the Nazareth House orphanages in Scotlandwere subjected to sexual abuse of the ""utmost depravity"". Lady Smith said the children's homes were places of fear, hostility and confusion where youngsters were physically abused and emotionally degraded ""with impunity"". The fourth phase findings have not yet been published. David Whelan, spokesman for Former Boys and Girls Abused in Quarriers (FBGA), said the findings ""vindicate"" its campaign for a public investigation. He accepted that the organisation was now ""very different"" but added: ""Lady Smith's findings are unequivocal in their condemnation of the past Quarriers organisation and the effects of this abuse and its impact on those who suffered such abuse in Quarriers past care. ""The extent and nature of the abuse which Lady Smith has found to have occurred in Quarriers is truly shocking."" Lady Smith will take the findings into account when she analyses all the evidence gathered by the inquiry and decides on her final recommendations. The inquiry is now in its fifth phase andis examining the alleged abuse of children who were sent to other countries, mainly Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Lady Smith said the charities did not offer many children the ""warmth, care and compassionate comfort they needed"" Alice Harper, chief executive of Quarriers, said: ""We repeat our unreserved apology to those who suffered abuse while in our care and acknowledge that children were subjected to physical, sexual and emotional abuse."" She added that Quarriers was committed to doing all it could to help survivors and families. ""We understand it may be difficult for former residents and survivors to make contact and our door remains open for anyone who wishes to speak to us and share their experiences, both good and bad,"" she said. Aberlour's chief executive SallyAnn Kelly said: ""We welcome today's interim findings from Lady Smith and wish to again reiterate our unreserved apology to those who suffered abuse while in the care of Aberlour. ""Undoubtedly the report is difficult to read in many places and includes harrowing testimonies from people who suffered great harm as children. We would like to acknowledge the strength and courage of all of those who were able to come forward. ""Aberlour is committed to ensuring that we continue to learn lessons from our past and improve our support to children and their families."" Those who continue to come forward to the inquiry with evidence about the care provided by Quarriers, Aberlour or Barnardo's will still be considered by Lady Smith.

"This video can not be played Derek Mackay says a delay to the UK budget could have ""profound consequences"" for Scotland UK government plans for a March budget are ""disrespectful to devolution"" and could have ""profound consequences"" for Scotland, Derek Mackay has warned. Chancellor Sajid Javid has announced he will set out his tax and spending plans on 11 March. Scottish ministers want to see these plans before drawing up their own, but will now have little time to do so. Mr Mackay, the Scottish finance secretary, said the move was ""really disrespectful"" to Holyrood. Scottish councils need to set their budgets by 11 March, and local government umbrella body Cosla has written to Mr Javid warning of ""catastrophic risks"" to local services. A date for the Scottish budget will be announced in due course, with Mr Mackay in talks with other parties and the Scottish Fiscal Commission about how to respond to these ""exceptional circumstances"". Live: MSPs ask 'urgent questions' on budget row 'Infrastructure revolution' in March Budget Mr Mackay was originally due to set out his budget plans on 12 December, but that wasdelayed because of the snap general electionwhich was held on that date. He wants to see the details of Mr Javid's budget before he sets out his own plans, given the impact of UK finances on the Scottish budget. He told BBC Scotland: ""We may have clarity over a date, but we don't have clarity over the numbers that might compose a budget."" He added: ""This is really disrespectful to devolution, to Scotland's parliament and people, in setting a UK budget so late. ""It shows the UK government hasn't considered devolution, hasn't considered our agreements or the impact on Scotland's public services, not least local government. Those are profound consequences."" Chancellor Sajid Javid will deliver the UK government's Budget on 11 March Mr Mackay added: ""The failure of the UK government to publish its budget at an earlier time means we do not have clarity on the funding available for our schools, hospitals and other vital public services. Despite this, we remain focused on introducing a Scottish budget for 2020-21 at the earliest practical opportunity."" During Treasury questions at Westminster, Mr Javid was accused by SNP Treasury spokeswoman Alison Thewliss of giving ""absolutely no thought to Scotland at all"". The Chancellor replied: ""In the election we've just had we talked time and time again about the need to unleash the entire UK, and of course that includes all of Scotland. ""Where Scotland has been let down time and time again is by the SNP government - which is giving Scottish people the highest taxes in the UK and the worst set of public services."" A Treasury spokesman later added: ""Nothing stops the Scottish Parliament from passing their budget before the UK budget. We are working with the Scottish government as part of an agreed process to provide the information they need to prepare their budget."" Despite fiscal powers including income tax being devolved to Holyrood, the UK budget process still has a huge bearing on the Scottish one. To start with, how much the UK government spends on each department has implications for the block grant - the package of funding allocated to Holyrood via the Barnett Formula. The forecasts of tax revenues from the Office for Budget Responsibility - which come out alongside the budget - also have a bearing on the block grant, as they form part of the calculations underpinning the devolved tax system. There is also the issue of the gap between the Scottish and UK tax systems - if Mr Javid decided, for example, to cut the higher rate of tax, Mr Mackay would have to decide whether to follow suit, or widen the gulf between what higher earners pay north and south of the border. He contends that he cannot make an informed decision until he has seen the full picture. Unlike at Westminster, there is actually a hard deadline on the Scottish budget process - the end of the current financial year. Unless a ""rate resolution"" setting out income tax rates and bands is passed by 1 April, the devolved income tax system ceases to apply. The rulebook as it stands doesn't provide for this happening. The Chartered Institute of Taxation says it would see Scotland ""effectively foregoing its ability to set its own income tax rates"". There are other practical hurdles too, such as drawing up and passing a Budget Bill. Normally this process stretches out over a period of months, with each Holyrood committee carrying out scrutiny of spending on their particular portfolio and MSPs holding debates in the chamber. This year, the parliamentary part of the process might have to be pushed through in a matter of days - leaving little time for scrutiny or deal-making between parties. Mr Javid's chosen date for his budget, 11 March, is also the legal deadline for Scottish councils to set their local tax rates. Council leaders are concerned that they will have to set these rates ""blind"", due to a knock-on effect of MSPs not knowing how much money they can allocate to local authorities, because they don't know how much money they have to work with. Cosla's resources spokeswoman Gail Macgregor - a Conservative councillor - said a March UK budget ""runs the risk of delaying the Scottish government's budget"". She added: ""This significantly impedes the ability for local authorities to formulate their own budgets, meaning Scotland's communities are disadvantaged"". Glasgow City Council leader Susan Aitken said the UK government ""has given not a single passing thought to Scottish public services"", while Dundee's John Alexander said the timing was ""beyond ridiculous"". It is theoretically possible for Mr Mackay to set his budget before the UK government one comes out, although the Fraser of Allander Institute think-tankhas called this approach ""risky"",externalgiven the potential for last-minute changes. The UK government has insisted that it can give Mr Mackay enough information to set his budget any time he likes. He replies that there has been ""absolutely no engagement"" to make this possible. Ultimately the deadline of the tax rate resolution means the matter must be settled by the end of March, but Scottish government officials point to the March 11 deadline for councils as equally important. They are considering a range of possible responses, including potentially changing the law to give councils more time to set budgets. There could be a middle route, where the Treasury gives Scottish officials enough ballpark information to draw up the bulk of their plans. This could in turn be passed on to councils, so they can set their tax rates, with the formal work of actually passing the budget bill at Holyrood put off until after Mr Javid makes everything official in March. However, the truncated timetable will also add extra pressure to the annual issue of whether the minority SNP administration can strike a deal with opposition parties to actually pass a budget bill.

"Children living at Quarriers homes were among those abused Children in homes run by Quarriers, Aberlour Child Care Trust, and Barnardo's suffered physical, emotional and sexual abuse, the Scottish Child Abuse Inquiry has concluded. Lady Smith, who is chairing the inquiry, said children who were at the institutions between 1921 and 1991 lived in ""harsh, rigid regimes"". She also said ""scant regard was paid to their dignity"". Quarriers, Aberlour and Barnardo's have apologised for the abuse suffered. In her findings,external, Lady Smith said: ""Many children did not find the warmth, care, and compassionate comfort they needed.

"Are the days of families tucking into a Christmas pudding after their festive dinner slowly coming to an end? Figures from market research company Kantar suggest they may be, as sales of the traditional dessert fell by 16% in the UK in the run-up to Christmas. There was also an 11% drop in sales of seasonal biscuits in supermarkets, while turkey sales were down by 1%. The figures come as Morrisons said its sales fell over the Christmas period amid ""challenging"" trading conditions. The UK's fourth-largest supermarket group reported a 1.7% fall in like-for-like sales - which strip out the impact of new stores - excluding fuel, for the 22 weeks to 5 January. Morrisons is the first of the big four chains to report Christmas sales, with Sainsbury's and Tesco due to report later this week. On Monday, discount chain Aldi said that its total UK sales in the four weeks to 24 December rose 7.9% from a year before, although it did not give a like-for-like comparison. It also said it sold 55 million mince pies over the festive period. According to Kantar, Aldi's sales over the 12 weeks to 29 December went up by 5.9%. Fellow discount retailer Lidl had the highest percentage increase in sales growth for bricks and mortar supermarkets over the same period, with its sales up 10.8%. Christmas shopping online or in person - who wins? Lidl and Aldi had their highest-ever combined Christmas market share of 13.7% - more than treble the figure in 2009. However, Britain's fastest-growing grocer according to Kantar was online retailer Ocado, where sales rose by 12.5%. This industry data shows that it's been a pretty slow Christmas for the supermarkets, with next to no growth. Households, on average, spent less this festive period than last. The big grocers have been working really hard to get us to part with our cash, with lots of promotions on alcohol and cut-price fuel. The competition has been intense. According to Kantar, the big four grocers have all struggled to increase sales and have lost market share. Once again, Aldi and Lidl have pulled in shoppers, thanks largely to opening dozens of new stores. Retailers will be hoping that consumers will be feeling more confident in 2020, buoyed by wages rising faster than inflation. But the big grocers are likely to remain under pressure. The discounters could reach a combined 17% market share this year and shopper behaviour continues to change. For instance, fast-food operators such as Deliveroo are growing in popularity. Overall, Kantar's figures indicated that in the 12 weeks to 29 December, supermarket sales grew by 0.2% from a year earlier - the slowest rate of growth over the Christmas period since 2015. ""There was no sign of the post-election rush many had hoped for in the final weeks before Christmas, with shoppers carefully watching their budgets,"" said Kantar's Fraser McKevitt. While sales of some foods went down, the fizz also went out of sparkling wine with its sales falling by 8%. Morrisons said recent trading had been ""unusually challenging"" However, beer and wine were more popular than in 2018 with respective rises of 1% and 2% in their sales over the previous year. And instead of Christmas pudding, the desserts that proved most popular were sponge puddings (up 12.4% on 2018), crumble (up 9.4%) and custard to go with them (up 28%). Another data firm - Nielsen - using different methodology to Kantar, said supermarket sales grew by just 0.5% in the last four weeks. It said grocery sales reached a peak of Â£6.2bn over the two weeks to 28 December - but this was down 0.2% compared with the same period in 2018. Reflecting on the Morrisons figures, the company's chief executive, David Potts, said: ""It was encouraging that during an unusually challenging period for sales, our execution was strong and our profitability robust, demonstrating the broad-based progress we have made during the turnaround. ""As always, we will take some learnings into the new year and look forward to 2020 with a strong plan and solid foundations on which to continue to grow."" Morrisons said its key Christmas items were ""once again very competitive"", with most prices the same as or lower than in 2018. Morrisons' vegan 'no pork' pies not stocked in Melton Mowbray Morrisons and Amazon expanding same-day deliveries Richard Lim, chief executive of Retail Economics, said the results suggested that Morrisons had been ""outmanoeuvred"" by its competitors. ""Shrinking sales demonstrate the fiercely competitive food sector,"" he added. ""Shoppers remained fixated on searching for the best value and highly price-sensitive against the backdrop of ongoing uncertainty.""

"The teenager had a list of weapons he wanted to buy The youngest person to be convicted of planning a terror attack in the UK has been detained for more than six years. The now 17-year-old wrote about an ""inevitable race war"" in his diary and listed locations from his home city of Durham in a ""guerrilla warfare"" manual. A jury had found the boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, guilty of preparation of terrorist acts between October 2017 and March 2018. He was sentenced to six years and eight months at Manchester Crown Court. Judge David Stockdale QC told the boy: ""These are offences of the utmost seriousness."" The teenager drew up a ""hit list"" of areas he wanted to attack He also ordered the detention be followed by an extension period on licence of five years. Thesix-week trial heard he was an adherent of ""occult neo-Nazism"", and described himself as a ""natural sadist"". His attack preparations included researching explosives and trying to obtain the dangerous chemical ammonium nitrate. He also wrote of planning to carry out an arson spree targeting synagogues in the Durham area using Molotov cocktails. The teenager was flanked by a guard during the hearing Addressing the defendant, the judge described him as a widely-read ""young man of high intellect"", adding this made it a matter of ""infinite regret"" that he had persisted on ""such a twisted and - many would say sick - ideological path"". He said the evidence in the trial ""tells its own macabre story"", and while his young age was a powerful mitigating factor, it was also a ""most disturbing"" aspect of the case. ""You suffer from an autistic spectrum disorder"", he told him, saying it was common ground between experts. The judge also said the teenager had written him a letter expressing ""remorse"". Teen neo-Nazi became 'living dead' As well as being found guilty of preparation of terrorist acts, he was also convicted of disseminating a terrorist publication, possessing an article for a purpose connected with terrorism and three counts of possessing a document or record containing information likely to be useful to a terrorist. His trial heard he had visited websites on firearms and was in communication with a gun auctioneer. After his arrest in March 2019, police found him in possession of instructions showing to make bombs and ricin - and that he had distributed firearms manuals online by uploading them to a neo-Nazi website. The boy had started writing a ""guerrilla warfare"" manual Earlier in the sentencing hearing, prosecutor Michelle Nelson QC described it as ""a gamut of offending across the terrorism legislation"". Mitigating, Nigel Evans QC said the teenager's lack of contrition may be ""interpreted as part of his autism, his ADHD"", and his parents, who previously ""didn't believe anything was wrong"", were ""now fully engaged"". Speaking after sentencing, Det Ch Supt Martin Snowden from Durham Police said: ""It is never an easy decision to investigate, to arrest and prosecute children of this age. ""We only do this when we think it is the last resort for us to go down that line. ""Prevention is always better than prosecution - we would have always preferred to engage earlier and divert him away from these beliefs and this activity.""

Overall, Kantar's figures indicated that in the 12 weeks to 29 December, supermarket sales grew by 0.2% from a year earlier - the slowest rate of growth over the Christmas period since 2015. ""There was no sign of the post-election rush many had hoped for in the final weeks before Christmas, with shoppers carefully watching their budgets,"" said Kantar's Fraser McKevitt. While sales of some foods went down, the fizz also went out of sparkling wine with its sales falling by 8%. Morrisons said recent trading had been ""unusually challenging"" However, beer and wine were more popular than in 2018 with respective rises of 1% and 2% in their sales over the previous year. And instead of Christmas pudding, the desserts that proved most popular were sponge puddings (up 12.4% on 2018), crumble (up 9.4%) and custard to go with them (up 28%). Another data firm - Nielsen - using different methodology to Kantar, said supermarket sales grew by just 0.5% in the last four weeks. It said grocery sales reached a peak of Â£6.2bn over the two weeks to 28 December - but this was down 0.2% compared with the same period in 2018. Reflecting on the Morrisons figures, the company's chief executive, David Potts, said: ""It was encouraging that during an unusually challenging period for sales, our execution was strong and our profitability robust, demonstrating the broad-based progress we have made during the turnaround. ""As always, we will take some learnings into the new year and look forward to 2020 with a strong plan and solid foundations on which to continue to grow."" Morrisons said its key Christmas items were ""once again very competitive"", with most prices the same as or lower than in 2018. Morrisons' vegan 'no pork' pies not stocked in Melton Mowbray Morrisons and Amazon expanding same-day deliveries Richard Lim, chief executive of Retail Economics, said the results suggested that Morrisons had been ""outmanoeuvred"" by its competitors.

"Drivers are already feeling the effects of climbing oil prices, with growing tensions between the US and Iran set to push them higher, according to the RAC. ""Prices at the pump have already increased by about a penny a litre,"" said Simon Williams, who tracks fuel prices for the company. Petrol is currently Â£1.27 per litre, with diesel costing Â£1.32, he said. But Brian Madderson, the chairman of the Petrol Retailers Association, said: ""Prices were due to rise anyway."" He warned against quickly trying to find a correlation between rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and the recent fuel price increase. However, the RAC's Mr Williams said price increases may become more pronounced if tensions grow between the US and Iran. ""It all depends on what happens between Tehran and Washington,"" he told the Today programme. ""If things get more fraught, then the oil traders will get more concerned and we could see the price rise."" The price of oil has spiked by as much as 6.7% since the US killed Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani in a drone strike ordered by Donald Trump. Who was Iran's Qasem Soleimani? But the cost of oil is not the only factor that affects petrol prices. Mr Williams said: ""There are several things unfortunately conspiring to make the price of fuel go up."" Oil producers' cartel Opec, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, has been limiting the supply of oil with a view to forcing an increase in prices. More than half of the petrol price goes to the Treasury. As a proportion of the petrol price, UK motorists pay the highest taxes in Europe, according to the RAC. Around 82p is added to every litre bought. The rest of the fuel price is determined by what your filling station paid for it. Changes in the value of the pound can have an impact, as oil is priced in dollars. If the pound weakens against the dollar, then it will be more expensive for a UK retailer to buy oil. Not necessarily. There are no rules for how petrol prices should react to changes in the oil price. But the RAC's Mr Williams says what we pay for fuel tends to ""rise like a rocket"" on news of oil price hikes, but then it rarely declines again at the same pace when oil becomes cheaper. ""Everyone talks about a supermarket war, but we could do with one actually,"" he says. Michael Haigh, head of commodities research at Societe Generale, said: ""A political leader killed on January 3 should not theoretically affect what you pay at the pump."" Companies can buy their petrol ahead of time, he explained, and they buy it in bulk directly from the energy companies. Supermarkets such as Morrisons and Tesco tend to work with short contracts that are priced by the oil markets on a bi-weekly basis. Therefore, if supply fears truly hit the market, then the price of those contracts will rise. ""If oil prices go up to $80, $90, or $100 a barrel, everyone is to going feel it at the pump,"" Mr Haigh said.

"Chancellor Sajid Javid has set 11 March as the date for his first Budget - the first since the general election. Mr Javid says billions of pounds will be invested ""across the country"". The Treasury will ""prioritise the environment"", he said and reiterated a plan to make use of low borrowing rates to spend on public services. John McDonnell, Labour's shadow chancellor, said he doubted whether the government would deliver on its investment or climate goals. Mr Javid will update his cabinet colleagues on the performance of the economy before facing MPs later on Tuesday. He told the BBC: ""There will be an infrastructure revolution in our great country. ""We set out in our manifesto during the election how we can afford to invest more and take advantage of the record low interest rates that we are seeing, but do it in a responsible way. ""There will be up to an extra Â£100bn of investment in infrastructure over the next few years that will be transformative for every part of our country,"" He added: ""In the Budget, we will be setting out how we are going to take advantage of all the huge opportunities that Brexit will bring. ""Also, how we are going to help hard-working people in particular - especially with the cost of living - and how we are going to level up across the entire country."" Mr Javid cancelled a 6 November Budget in October to make way for the general election. This means that the Office for Budget Responsibility, which monitors the government's performance on money management, may not be able to comply with its legal requirement of publishing two forecasts in the financial year, which ends on 31 March. Critics say this means less independent scrutiny of the public finances. Why North-South is not England's only divide The Budget is the government's yearly announcement on its plans for tax and spending for the coming financial year, which starts in April. ""After a decade of wrecking the economy, we can have no confidence in a Tory government delivering the scale of investment needed for renewal, especially with a no-deal Brexit still on the table,"" said Mr McDonnell. ""The lack of foresight in not focusing this budget on the threat of climate change is also criminally irresponsible. ""The government has learnt nothing from the fires in Australia and the floods on Indonesia. This will be a budget of climate change recklessness, not renewal."" This is not just about a change of date for a Budget originally postponed because of the Brexit delay and then an election. A rewiring of the Treasury is in the works. First, the Budget to be presented on 11 March will be quite fundamentally different to the Budget that never happened. The election result gives a Commons majority and a mandate to act confidently and decisively, and in a manner that fleshes out the election rhetoric about ""levelling up"" - helping slow-growing regions of the economy. In the intervening two months, the Treasury will have to work up a new national infrastructure strategy that delivers on the plan to rebalance regional inequalities, some of which stem from decisions made nationally on, for example, transport spending. Insiders suggest that the changes could reach into the heart of the Treasury, taking up advice from independent economists and regional mayors to change the way that the government calculates the value for money of public spending on investment projects. The so-called ""Green Book"", used to evaluate big investment projects, could be changed to rectify a formula and a process that biases government investment to where economic growth, high productivity, and high house prices are already concentrated - in and around London.

"Are the days of families tucking into a Christmas pudding after their festive dinner slowly coming to an end? Figures from market research company Kantar suggest they may be, as sales of the traditional dessert fell by 16% in the UK in the run-up to Christmas. There was also an 11% drop in sales of seasonal biscuits in supermarkets, while turkey sales were down by 1%. The figures come as Morrisons said its sales fell over the Christmas period amid ""challenging"" trading conditions. The UK's fourth-largest supermarket group reported a 1.7% fall in like-for-like sales - which strip out the impact of new stores - excluding fuel, for the 22 weeks to 5 January. Morrisons is the first of the big four chains to report Christmas sales, with Sainsbury's and Tesco due to report later this week. On Monday, discount chain Aldi said that its total UK sales in the four weeks to 24 December rose 7.9% from a year before, although it did not give a like-for-like comparison. It also said it sold 55 million mince pies over the festive period. According to Kantar, Aldi's sales over the 12 weeks to 29 December went up by 5.9%. Fellow discount retailer Lidl had the highest percentage increase in sales growth for bricks and mortar supermarkets over the same period, with its sales up 10.8%. Christmas shopping online or in person - who wins? Lidl and Aldi had their highest-ever combined Christmas market share of 13.7% - more than treble the figure in 2009. However, Britain's fastest-growing grocer according to Kantar was online retailer Ocado, where sales rose by 12.5%. This industry data shows that it's been a pretty slow Christmas for the supermarkets, with next to no growth. Households, on average, spent less this festive period than last. The big grocers have been working really hard to get us to part with our cash, with lots of promotions on alcohol and cut-price fuel. The competition has been intense. According to Kantar, the big four grocers have all struggled to increase sales and have lost market share. Once again, Aldi and Lidl have pulled in shoppers, thanks largely to opening dozens of new stores. Retailers will be hoping that consumers will be feeling more confident in 2020, buoyed by wages rising faster than inflation. But the big grocers are likely to remain under pressure. The discounters could reach a combined 17% market share this year and shopper behaviour continues to change. For instance, fast-food operators such as Deliveroo are growing in popularity. Overall, Kantar's figures indicated that in the 12 weeks to 29 December, supermarket sales grew by 0.2% from a year earlier - the slowest rate of growth over the Christmas period since 2015.

Figures from market research company Kantar suggest they may be, as sales of the traditional dessert fell by 16% in the UK in the run-up to Christmas. There was also an 11% drop in sales of seasonal biscuits in supermarkets, while turkey sales were down by 1%. The figures come as Morrisons said its sales fell over the Christmas period amid ""challenging"" trading conditions. The UK's fourth-largest supermarket group reported a 1.7% fall in like-for-like sales - which strip out the impact of new stores - excluding fuel, for the 22 weeks to 5 January. Morrisons is the first of the big four chains to report Christmas sales, with Sainsbury's and Tesco due to report later this week. On Monday, discount chain Aldi said that its total UK sales in the four weeks to 24 December rose 7.9% from a year before, although it did not give a like-for-like comparison. It also said it sold 55 million mince pies over the festive period. According to Kantar, Aldi's sales over the 12 weeks to 29 December went up by 5.9%. Fellow discount retailer Lidl had the highest percentage increase in sales growth for bricks and mortar supermarkets over the same period, with its sales up 10.8%. Christmas shopping online or in person - who wins? Lidl and Aldi had their highest-ever combined Christmas market share of 13.7% - more than treble the figure in 2009. However, Britain's fastest-growing grocer according to Kantar was online retailer Ocado, where sales rose by 12.5%. This industry data shows that it's been a pretty slow Christmas for the supermarkets, with next to no growth. Households, on average, spent less this festive period than last. The big grocers have been working really hard to get us to part with our cash, with lots of promotions on alcohol and cut-price fuel. The competition has been intense. According to Kantar, the big four grocers have all struggled to increase sales and have lost market share. Once again, Aldi and Lidl have pulled in shoppers, thanks largely to opening dozens of new stores. Retailers will be hoping that consumers will be feeling more confident in 2020, buoyed by wages rising faster than inflation. But the big grocers are likely to remain under pressure. The discounters could reach a combined 17% market share this year and shopper behaviour continues to change. For instance, fast-food operators such as Deliveroo are growing in popularity. Overall, Kantar's figures indicated that in the 12 weeks to 29 December, supermarket sales grew by 0.2% from a year earlier - the slowest rate of growth over the Christmas period since 2015. ""There was no sign of the post-election rush many had hoped for in the final weeks before Christmas, with shoppers carefully watching their budgets,"" said Kantar's Fraser McKevitt. While sales of some foods went down, the fizz also went out of sparkling wine with its sales falling by 8%. Morrisons said recent trading had been ""unusually challenging"" However, beer and wine were more popular than in 2018 with respective rises of 1% and 2% in their sales over the previous year. And instead of Christmas pudding, the desserts that proved most popular were sponge puddings (up 12.4% on 2018), crumble (up 9.4%) and custard to go with them (up 28%). Another data firm - Nielsen - using different methodology to Kantar, said supermarket sales grew by just 0.5% in the last four weeks. It said grocery sales reached a peak of Â£6.2bn over the two weeks to 28 December - but this was down 0.2% compared with the same period in 2018. Reflecting on the Morrisons figures, the company's chief executive, David Potts, said: ""It was encouraging that during an unusually challenging period for sales, our execution was strong and our profitability robust, demonstrating the broad-based progress we have made during the turnaround. ""As always, we will take some learnings into the new year and look forward to 2020 with a strong plan and solid foundations on which to continue to grow."" Morrisons said its key Christmas items were ""once again very competitive"", with most prices the same as or lower than in 2018. Morrisons' vegan 'no pork' pies not stocked in Melton Mowbray Morrisons and Amazon expanding same-day deliveries Richard Lim, chief executive of Retail Economics, said the results suggested that Morrisons had been ""outmanoeuvred"" by its competitors. ""Shrinking sales demonstrate the fiercely competitive food sector,"" he added. ""Shoppers remained fixated on searching for the best value and highly price-sensitive against the backdrop of ongoing uncertainty.""

To reinforce these complaints, scientists have been releasing pictures of trains of bright dots passing overhead - reflections from the satellites as they move around the globe.

"Naqsh-e Jahan Square, in the city of Isfahan, is one of two dozen Unesco World Heritage sites in Iran US President Donald Trump has faced growing criticism over his threats to attack Iran's cultural sites. Mr Trump made the threats amid fallout from the US assassination of Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani. The president said cultural sites were among 52 identified Iranian targets that could be attacked if Iranians ""torture, maim and blow up our people"". But the UN's cultural organisation and UK foreign secretary were among those to note that such sites were protected. The US and Iran have signed conventions to protect cultural heritage, including during conflict. Military attacks targeting cultural sites are considered war crimes under international law. Qasem Soleimani was killed in a US drone strike in Baghdad on Friday on the orders of Mr Trump. The killing has sharply increased regional tensions, with Iran threatening ""severe revenge"". The first came in a series of tweets on Saturday. Mr Trump said the US had identified 52 Iranian sites, some ""at a very high level and important to Iran and the Iranian culture"", and warned they would be ""hit very fast and hard"" if Tehran carried out revenge attacks on US interests or personnel. US ready to strike 52 Iranian sites, Trump warns Who was Iran's Qasem Soleimani? In pictures: Iran's sites of cultural importance Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared to try to soften the threat by saying the US would act within international law. But the president later repeated his threat, saying: ""They're allowed to kill our people, they're allowed to torture and maim our people, they're allowed to use roadside bombs and blow up our people - and we're not allowed to touch their cultural site? It doesn't work that way."" On Monday, White House adviser Kellyanne Conway defended the president, saying he had not said he was targeting cultural sites, only ""asking the question"". She also said: ""Iran has many strategic military sites that you may cite are also cultural sites"", before later clarifying her remark to say she was not suggesting Iran had camouflaged military targets as cultural sites. Defence Secretary Mark Esper was later asked if the US would target cultural sites, and said: ""We will follow the laws of armed conflict."" When asked if that meant no, ""because targeting a cultural site is a war crime?"", he responded: ""That's the laws of armed conflict."" The director general of the UN's cultural organisation, Unesco, Audrey Azoulay, said both Iran and the US had signed a1972 convention to protect the world's natural and cultural heritage,external. They have also both signed a1954 convention protecting cultural property in the event of armed conflict,external. Mr Trump withdrew the US from Unesco in 2018, citing alleged anti-Israeli bias. US Democratic senators Elizabeth Warren and Chris Murphy said Mr Trump was ""threatening to commit war crimes"", echoing similar statements by Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif. On Monday, UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said cultural sites were protected by international law, and Britain expected that to be respected. The wider region has suffered many cultural attacks carried out by the Islamic State group, which targeted mosques, shrines, churches and famous sites such as Palmyra in Syria. The Taliban in Afghanistan destroyed the world's tallest Buddha statues, in Bamiyan province. This video can not be played Once destroyed by the Taliban, the Buddha statues live again in Kabul By Sam Farzaneh, BBC Persian As soon as the news of the killing of Qasem Soleimani broke, Iranians were divided. Some were offended and some celebrated it on social media. The division got ugly on Twitter. Some were accused of being victims of ""Stockholm syndrome"" because they were angry about the killing, and others were labelled traitors. But US President Donald Trump's tweet threatening the targeting of Iran's cultural sites united Iranians against him. Some of the sites are religious and some are not, but secular and religious Iranians are proud of their heritage and came together to denounce the president's threats. Nothing could better unite divided Iranians at home and in the diaspora than a hit on their beloved past. Iran's foreign minister seized the opportunity and in several tweets compared President Trump to the Islamic State group, which destroyed many cultural sites in Syria. Iran is home to two dozen Unesco World Heritage sites. These are landmarks the UN body believes need preserving for their cultural, historic or scientific significance.They include:,external Behistun, in Kermanshah province, where there is a bas-relief and cuneiform inscription ordered by Darius I, The Great, in the 6th Century BC Naqsh-e Jahan Square in the city of Isfahan, which was built in the early 17th Century and is one of the largest city squares in the world Golestan Palace in Tehran, the residence and seat of power for the Qajar dynasty which ruled Iran from 1785 to 1925 There are also a number of sites which - while not listed by Unesco - still retain huge cultural importance.

John McDonnell, Labour's shadow chancellor, said he doubted whether the government would deliver on its investment or climate goals. Mr Javid will update his cabinet colleagues on the performance of the economy before facing MPs later on Tuesday. He told the BBC: ""There will be an infrastructure revolution in our great country. ""We set out in our manifesto during the election how we can afford to invest more and take advantage of the record low interest rates that we are seeing, but do it in a responsible way. ""There will be up to an extra Â£100bn of investment in infrastructure over the next few years that will be transformative for every part of our country,"" He added: ""In the Budget, we will be setting out how we are going to take advantage of all the huge opportunities that Brexit will bring. ""Also, how we are going to help hard-working people in particular - especially with the cost of living - and how we are going to level up across the entire country."" Mr Javid cancelled a 6 November Budget in October to make way for the general election. This means that the Office for Budget Responsibility, which monitors the government's performance on money management, may not be able to comply with its legal requirement of publishing two forecasts in the financial year, which ends on 31 March. Critics say this means less independent scrutiny of the public finances. Why North-South is not England's only divide The Budget is the government's yearly announcement on its plans for tax and spending for the coming financial year, which starts in April. ""After a decade of wrecking the economy, we can have no confidence in a Tory government delivering the scale of investment needed for renewal, especially with a no-deal Brexit still on the table,"" said Mr McDonnell. ""The lack of foresight in not focusing this budget on the threat of climate change is also criminally irresponsible. ""The government has learnt nothing from the fires in Australia and the floods on Indonesia. This will be a budget of climate change recklessness, not renewal."" This is not just about a change of date for a Budget originally postponed because of the Brexit delay and then an election. A rewiring of the Treasury is in the works. First, the Budget to be presented on 11 March will be quite fundamentally different to the Budget that never happened. The election result gives a Commons majority and a mandate to act confidently and decisively, and in a manner that fleshes out the election rhetoric about ""levelling up"" - helping slow-growing regions of the economy. In the intervening two months, the Treasury will have to work up a new national infrastructure strategy that delivers on the plan to rebalance regional inequalities, some of which stem from decisions made nationally on, for example, transport spending. Insiders suggest that the changes could reach into the heart of the Treasury, taking up advice from independent economists and regional mayors to change the way that the government calculates the value for money of public spending on investment projects. The so-called ""Green Book"", used to evaluate big investment projects, could be changed to rectify a formula and a process that biases government investment to where economic growth, high productivity, and high house prices are already concentrated - in and around London.

"Russian firm Yandex is hoping to impress CES delegates with its self-driving cars Driverless cars have become a staple of CES but in the past they've generally been kept stationary on the show floor. When Russian tech giant Yandex invited me to go for a ride on the actual streets of Las Vegas in its model - a reworked Toyota Prius loaded with sensors and a big computer in the boot - I was expecting to be underwhelmed. I've seen mini-delivery trucks pootle around at walking speeds on test tracks and I've been in a driverless car with a human very much at the wheel, fingers nervously poised millimetres from the steering wheel ""just in case"". And rightly so - when autonomous car tech goes wrong, as Tesla and Uber can both testify,the results can be catastrophic. With all that in mind, I wasn't expecting there to be no driver at all. Restaurant cat robot meows at dining customers Preview of tomorrow's tech on show in Las Vegas CES chief defends invite for Ivanka Trump It's a disconcerting thing to be sitting in the backseat of a car with nobody between you and the windshield, especially when that vehicle is travelling at 40mph (64km/h) with pedestrians nearby. A man called Alexei, the ""engineer"", was in the front passenger seat - so there was a ""just in case"" of sorts. Alexei had a comically large red button that would have done, well, something dramatic, I suppose. They wouldn't let me press it. But as we hit speeds of 44mph on our 20-minute driverless drive, we changed lanes numerous times and negotiated busy junctions without human input - emergency or otherwise. Allow Twitter content?

Yandex has a surprisingly low profile in the West given that it is often referred to as ""the Russian Google"". Just like Google, it is a tech giant with fingers in many pies. It says most of its revenue still comes from its search engine, which enjoys a 60% market share in Russia. It entered the driverless car game in 2016, and got its vehicle on public roads in December 2017. Since then, it has honed the tech on the streets of Moscow and Tel Aviv. Yandex's fleet has clocked 1.5 million miles (2.4 million km) of autonomous driving so far. That puts it behind the likes of Google's Waymo, which had achieved more than 10 million as of July 2019. ""The robot drivers which we are developing, they cannot get distracted,"" Yulia Shveyko, head of media relations for Yandex driverless cars, tells me. The fleet is already used by Yandex's rideshare service in Moscow. ""So we have passengers who are using our app to order rides. They're going to the university, post office, grocery store, and it's completely integrated into their typical routines,"" she adds. ""And what we've seen is that within a very quick time period, once they feel safe it starts to feel very normal."" I can't vouch for this of course - except to say next time I am in Moscow, I will try to rock up at a supermarket in a driverless car and see if anybody bats an eyelid. I have to admit that after an exhilarating first few minutes, it all felt pretty normal to me too. Later, I decided to take a second driverless ride - this time from rideshare service Lyft, which is offering driverless journeys around Las Vegas in its fleet of adapted BMWs during CES. My colleague Cody and I didn't tell them we were journalists, mainly because we couldn't get a word in edgeways, but this was a far more cautious journey. There were two humans in the front - a driver and a man called Dan who seemed to be a kind of tour guide. The vehicle was actually in manual mode much of the time. Not all of the hotels have agreed to this tech being used on their private property, so getting on and off the strip required human effort. If you want an opinion about anything, ask a cabbie. So, later on, I hopped into yet another car, showed the driver, Steve, a little video I filmed of the Yandex experience and asked him what he thought. ""Driverless cars are scary to me,"" he said. ""I need to be in control or somebody needs to be in control, not the computer-control."" Yandex may well claim everyone is happily hopping into driverless cars in Moscow - but the mood might be colder elsewhere. Will robot drivers rule the road?
