"The US has officially named China as a ""currency manipulator"", a statement which will intensify tensions between the world's two largest economies. The announcement by the US Treasury follows a sharp fall in the value of the Chinese yuan against the dollar. The drop caught markets off-guard as Beijing usually supports the currency. Last week, China pledged to retaliate after US President Donald Trump vowed to impose 10% tariffs on $300bn (Â£246.7bn) of Chinese imports. On Monday, the yuan passed the seven-per-dollar level for the first time since 2008, prompting Mr Trump to accuse China on Twitter of manipulating its currency. Why is China's currency falling? The US Treasury department defines currency manipulation as when countries deliberately influence the exchange rate between their currency and the US dollar to gain ""unfair competitive advantage in international trade"". A weaker yuan makes Chinese exports more competitive, or cheaper to buy with foreign currencies. On Monday, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) said the slump in the yuan was driven by ""unilateralism and trade protectionism measures and the imposition of tariff increases on China"". The US government said,externalTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will now engage with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) ""to eliminate the unfair competitive advantage created by China's latest actions"".

The move is largely symbolic because the US is already engaged in trade discussions with China and has implemented tariffs on the country's imports. However, it fulfils a presidential campaign promise by Mr Trump who pledged to name China a currency manipulator on his first day in office. The decision rattled investors, with Wall Street's main stock market indexesrecording their worst trading day for 2019. Asia markets extended losses on Tuesday, with the Shanghai Composite down 1.3% in afternoon trading. By Michelle Fleury, New York Business Correspondent The move doesn't change much. Not legally speaking. But it is a big deal, accentuating just how fast things have gone south between the world's two largest economies. When the US Treasury labels a country a currency manipulator - as it has done here with China - the next step would normally be for negotiations to begin between the two countries. In this case, trade negotiations have already been going on for more than a year. The process also opens the path for America to introduce tariffs. Again, that's already happening as part of Mr Trump's 'America First' approach to trade. Under the designation, Mr Mnuchin is also expected to work with the IMF to address its concerns. It's not clear yet what that will yield. Still it's worth remembering that while the decision may not change much technically, it will have significant political ramifications. Nobody thinks this will increase the odds of a compromise by the Chinese side when it comes to trade. So don't be surprised if the prospect of a currency war further rattles investors' already frayed nerves. No country has officially been named a currency manipulator by the US since Bill Clinton's administration did so to China in 1994. In its announcement, the US Treasury said: ""China has a long history of facilitating an undervalued currency through protracted, large-scale intervention in the foreign exchange market. ""In recent days, China has taken concrete steps to devalue its currency, while maintaining substantial foreign exchange reserves despite active use of such tools in the past.""

"Supermarket giant Tesco says about 4,500 staff in 153 Tesco Metro stores are set to lose their jobs in the latest round of redundancies. The UK's largest grocer said changes to the way the stores operated would ""serve shoppers better"" and help to ""run our business more sustainably"". It said the stores were operating in an increasingly competitive and challenging retail environment. Tesco boss Jason Tarry said the firm did not take the jobs decision lightly. The company said the Metro format was originally designed for larger, weekly shops, but now nearly 70% of customers used them as convenience stores, buying food for that day. Tesco, which employs about 340,000 people in the UK and Republic of Ireland, said that changes to the stores would now include: ""faster and simpler"" ways of filling shelves, with fewer products stored in the back rooms and more stock going straight to the shop floor staff working ""more flexibly"" across the store to improve customer service at the busiest times of the day and in the right areas of the store ""leaner"" management structure. ""In a challenging, evolving retail environment, with increasing cost pressures, we have to continue to review the way we run our stores to ensure we reflect the way our customers are shopping and do so in the most efficient way,"" Mr Tarry added. Tesco Metro shops are sized between Tesco superstores and Tesco Express shops. They first opened in 1994. Tesco raises prices on 1,000 products Tesco profits jump in uncertain market Tesco counter cost cuts to hit 9,000 jobs It is also making some changes in 134 of its 1,750 Express stores, where customer footfall is lower. Changes in those stores will include ""a slight reduction in opening hours during quieter trading periods at the start and end of the day, and simplifying stock routines"". Tesco is in the midst of trying to save Â£1.5bn as the competition between supermarkets intensifies. It comes as German budget rivals Aldi and Lidl continue to put pressure on the big four supermarkets. In January, Tesco announced it would close food counters in 90 of its stores as part of a wider cost-cutting plan that would affect 9,000 staff. Tesco said then that its remaining fish, meat and deli counters in 700 stores would be run on a full-time or flexible basis. It has also opened a discount chain, Jack's, to take on its German rivals. Pauline Foulkes, Usdaw national officer, said: ""Our members at Tesco are shocked and dismayed by yet another round of potential job losses, coming just months after 9,000 staff were put at risk in stores. ""We will be working hard to make sure that any members potentially affected by these proposals are supported at this difficult time and throughout the consultation period. ""This issue is not confined to Tesco, our High Streets are in crisis, with jobs being lost due to shops closing, retailers folding and businesses engaging in significant restructuring to survive. ""We need the government to address the worries and concerns of shop workers and our members.""

"Jaclene Paolucci, pictured with her husband, John, says she does not know why complete strangers feel they have the right to advise her on her pregnancy Six months into her pregnancy, Jaclene Paolucci has had enough of strangers offering unsolicited advice and thinking it's fine to touch her without permission. The last straw was a stranger interrupting her as she ordered her regular latte at a Starbucks in New York - to suggest she switched to decaf. Jaclene, 36, took to Twitter to tell her more than 3,000 followers what had happened and that her response - telling the woman: ""I'm not pregnant,"" - had led to a spluttered apology. And she was shocked by how many people could relate to her experience. So far, her tweet has received nearly 5,000 responses, 78,000 retweets and close to 700,000 ""likes"". Jaclene Paolucci's tweet resonated with hundreds of thousands of people ""I've discovered that if you want unsolicited advice, then you should get pregnant,"" Jaclene told BBC News. ""It feels like the moment you do get pregnant, then you lose your body's autonomy. ""People start touching you and everybody has an opinion on how you should act, what you should wear - everything. ""The only people who should be able to do that should be you and your doctor."" Jaclene said she limited herself to one coffee a day and had taken medical advice about it. She said: ""What if I hadn't been pregnant? ""And there are many postpartum women who find it hard to get rid of their bellies. ""Comments like this can be hurtful so unless someone is having a baby in front of you, you shouldn't get involved. Jaclene is tired of people having a say about her pregnancy She added: ""People feel entitled and your body becomes a community body. ""We're in an exciting but scary time and there's so much information out there which can often be contradictory. However, I trust my body and I will make the best decisions for it. ""What I did find interesting, though, was after I tweeted, many of those who disagreed with my stance were men."" Are you in your 30s and facing 'the swerve'? Does society still pressure women to have children? Modern mothers 'watched and judged' Dr Tara Chettiar says even with her expertise, she was not immune to unsolicited advice during her two pregnancies Among the thousands of women who responded is Dr Tara Chettiar, of Kansas City, a specialist in obstetrics and gynaecology. ""I was in the hospital doing my patient rounds about six years ago, I was heavily pregnant and I was wearing my scrubs and white coat,"" she said. ""As I stopped to get a coffee, one staff member told me that I shouldn't be drinking coffee at all. ""I was astounded that anyone would say that - let alone to an expert in the field.

""I had to pause and say that a small amount of caffeine had been shown to be safe outside of the first trimester. ""In fact, it's fine in the first trimester, although I was visibly beyond that point."" ""I have so many patients who have told me about their experiences around unsolicited advice and as someone who has gone through this myself twice now, I loved seeing how Jaclene had called it out."" She added: ""A lot of pregnant women find they are constantly being told what to do by others but let's be clear: pregnancy is not a disability."" The advice is largely well intentioned, says Dr Chettiar, because it's about an issue everyone feels they can connect with. ""Family, babies are so much at the heart of the human experience. So many people want to become part of the journey. It's the same reason that people also feel they can ask, 'When will you have children?' ""Because in their minds, this is something that connects us all. But in reality, those questions and 'advice' make women feel separate, different, and as though something is wrong with them."" @ethereumgirl also responded to the thread, highlighting the constant touching she had experienced during her pregnancies. Asked why she had wanted to share her experiences on Twitter, she told BBC News: ""I think what pulled me in is this unwanted expectation when you become pregnant that you belong to 'the collective society', that some others feel more comfortable responding to you in ways that would be otherwise socially unacceptable.""

"An artificial ""tongue"" which can taste subtle differences between whiskies could help tackle the counterfeit alcohol trade, according to engineers. They have built a tiny taster which exploits the properties of gold and aluminium to test differences between the spirits. The technology can pick up on the subtler distinctions between the same whisky aged in different barrels. It can tell the the difference between whiskies aged for 12, 15 and 18 years. Engineers say the tongue ""tasted"" the differences with greater than 99% accuracy. Alasdair Clark, of the University of Glasgow's school of engineering, said: ""We call this an artificial tongue because it acts similarly to a human tongue - like us, it can't identify the individual chemicals which make coffee taste different to apple juice but it can easily tell the difference between these complex chemical mixtures. ""We're not the first researchers to make an artificial tongue, but we're the first to make a single artificial tongue that uses two different types of nanoscale metal 'tastebuds', which provides more information about the 'taste' of each sample and allows a faster and more accurate response."" He said the tongue could be used to ""taste"" virtually any liquid - not just whisky. Dr Alasdair Clark with a scaled-up version of the materials that make up the ""tongue"", which are usually too small to see with the naked eye Dr Clark added: ""In addition to its obvious potential for use in identifying counterfeit alcohols, it could be used in food safety testing, quality control, security - really any area where a portable, reusable method of tasting would be useful."" Whisky was poured over a chequerboard pattern of the two metals - which act as ""tastebuds"" - and researchers then measured how they absorbed light while submerged. Subtle differences which were highlighted on the artificial tongue allowed the team to identify different types of the spirit. The team used the tongue to sample a selection of whiskies from Glenfiddich, Glen Marnoch and Laphroaig. Research was conducted by engineers and chemists from the universities of Glasgow and Strathclyde. Their paper, titled'Whisky tasting using a bimetallic nanoplasmonic tongue',,externalis published in Nanoscale.

"India has deployed tens of thousands of troops to Indian-administered Kashmir in recent days India's government has revoked part of the constitution that gives Indian-administered Kashmir special status, prompting fears of unrest. Article 370 is sensitive because it guarantees significant autonomy for the Muslim-majority state. The measure was accompanied by a telecoms and media blackout which began on Sunday evening. There is a long-running insurgency on the Indian side. India and Pakistan fought several conflicts over Kashmir. For many Kashmiris, Article 370 was the main justification for being a part of India and by revoking it, the BJP has irrevocably changed Delhi's relationship with the region, the BBC's Geeta Pandey reports from Delhi. Meanwhile India's parliament is expected to pass a bill splitting Indian-administered Kashmir into two territories governed directly by Delhi. Pakistan condemned India's decision to revoke the special status of its part of Kashmir as illegal, saying it would ""exercise all possible options"" to counter it. ""India is playing a dangerous game which will have serious consequences for regional peace and stability,"" said Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi. Why India and Pakistan dispute Kashmir Why a special law on Kashmir is controversial Modi's Kashmir move will fuel resentment 'India has betrayed Kashmir' But an Indian government source said there was no external implication as the Line of Control, the de facto border, and boundaries of Kashmir had not been altered. During the partition of the Indian subcontinent in 1947, some expected Jammu and Kashmir, like other Muslim-majority regions, to go to Pakistan. But the ruler of the princely state, who had initially wanted Jammu and Kashmir to become independent, joined India in return for help against an invasion of tribesmen from Pakistan. War broke out between India and Pakistan, and Kashmir effectively became partitioned. The region, which remains one of the most militarised zones in the world, has been a flashpoint between India and Pakistan for more than six decades. By Aamir Peerzada, BBC News, Srinagar By the time we woke up this morning, the internet was gone and we now have no mobile connectivity. If people step out of their homes, they see paramilitary forces on every street. Almost every major road is shut - we are hearing that more troops are being deployed. No-one knows what is happening in other parts of the state - we can't talk to anyone else. People are concerned - they don't know what is happening, they don't know what is going to happen. It's an atmosphere of fear. People are scared to come out, they have stockpiled food for months. Kashmiris have always been willing to defend the state's special status. It looks like a long road ahead, and no-one knows what's next. In 1949, a special provision was added to India's constitution providing autonomy to Jammu and Kashmir. Article 370 allows the state to have its own constitution, a separate flag and independence over all matters except foreign affairs, defence and communications. Another provision later added under Article 370 - 35A - gives special privileges to permanent residents, including state government jobs and the exclusive right to own property in the state. It is seen as protecting the state's distinct demographic character as the only Muslim-majority state in India. The move by the Hindu nationalist BJP government prompted outrage in parliament, and some legal experts have called it an attack on the constitution. Critics fear the move is designed to change the demographic make-up of India-administered Kashmir - by giving people from the rest of the country to right to acquire property and settle there permanently. The state'sformer chief minister, Mehbooba Mufti, told the BBC she felt there was a ""sinister design"" to the decision. ""They just want to occupy our land and want to make this Muslim-majority state like any other state and reduce us to a minority and disempower us totally."" The ruling BJP made revoking Article 370 part of the party's 2019 election manifesto - and it won a landslide victory earlier this year. It has argued that Article 370 has prevented the region's development and its integration with India. Supporters of India's ruling BJP have been celebrating the move An Indian government source told journalists the region's special status had discouraged outside investment and affected its economy, while terrorism and smuggling were rife. ""A set of anachronistic provisions were not allowing the progress of Kashmir,"" the source said. ""The huge sum of money and resources which were going into the state were not being optimised."" India's government announced a presidential order revoking all of Article 370 apart from one clause which says that the state is an integral part of India. The order was met by massive protests from the opposition - but has now been signed into law by President Ram Nath Kovind. Prior to the announcement, a telecoms and media blackout began on Sunday evening in the region. The government explained the move as being aimed at pre-empting any violence that the announcement might trigger. Officials said the restrictions would not be in place for long. Opponents of the move have also been out in the streets of Delhi Parliament is also expected to approve a measure dividing the state into two regions ruled by the central government. One region will combine Muslim-majority Kashmir and Hindu-majority Jammu. The other is Buddhist-majority Ladakh, which is culturally and historically close to Tibet. The forgotten victims of the world's highest war The funerals driving youth to militancy Indian-administered Kashmir is in a state of lockdown. Curfew-like conditions have been imposed, and orders preventing the assembly of more than four people have been introduced. Tens of thousands of Indian troops were deployed to the region ahead of Monday's announcement and tourists were told to leave under warnings of a terror threat. This video can not be played In December Yogita Limaye examined why there had been a rise in violence in Kashmir In the hours before Monday's announcement, two of the state's former chief ministers - Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti - were placed under house arrest.

"Kate Allsop was one of two special advisers hired to help Merthyr Tydfil council An ex-mayor hired to help a troubled council has been sacked after being named as a Brexit Party candidate. Kate Allsop, who served as independent mayor of Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, spent less than a week advising Merthyr Tydfil council. Local government minister Julie James said it would be ""inappropriate"" for Ms Allsop to continue in the role. Ms Allsop said she was ""absolutely gutted"", adding she had not been asked about her political leanings. She was one of two advisers brought in by the Welsh Government last month after the independent-led council appealed to ministers for help. A damning Wales Audit Office report said the authority faced financial challenges, service pressures, leadership and governance issues. Kate Allsop was named as a Brexit Party candidate less than a week into her role with Merthyr On Friday, Ms Allsop was named by Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage as its candidate for Mansfield at the next general election. She told BBC Wales she was called by a Welsh Government official on Saturday who said her contract to work with Merthyr council was being terminated. ""I'd done a huge amount of the work in just three-and-a-half days,"" Ms Allsop said. ""To be forced out because I'm standing up for democracy is an absolute travesty. ""Nothing changed in my views and ability and my skillset. ""I'm absolutely gutted - I loved Merthyr, it's a lovely town, I wanted to help the council get back on the right track, improve relationships with members, officers and the public. ""They never asked me if I had any political leanings, and they didn't say when they appointed me it was on the basis that I don't declare any political allegiance."" Deeply split Merthyr council seeks help Mayoral election campaign probe dropped The Welsh Government said Ms Allsop had been hired because of her ""considerable previous experience as an independent council leader who would be able to work with the range of political interests in Merthyr"". Ms James added: ""I am grateful for the work that Kate had already undertaken as part of our support package with the council. ""However, as she has declared her intention to stand as an MP it would be inappropriate for her to continue in her role as independent adviser.""

"Jaclene Paolucci, pictured with her husband, John, says she does not know why complete strangers feel they have the right to advise her on her pregnancy Six months into her pregnancy, Jaclene Paolucci has had enough of strangers offering unsolicited advice and thinking it's fine to touch her without permission. The last straw was a stranger interrupting her as she ordered her regular latte at a Starbucks in New York - to suggest she switched to decaf. Jaclene, 36, took to Twitter to tell her more than 3,000 followers what had happened and that her response - telling the woman: ""I'm not pregnant,"" - had led to a spluttered apology. And she was shocked by how many people could relate to her experience. So far, her tweet has received nearly 5,000 responses, 78,000 retweets and close to 700,000 ""likes"". Jaclene Paolucci's tweet resonated with hundreds of thousands of people ""I've discovered that if you want unsolicited advice, then you should get pregnant,"" Jaclene told BBC News. ""It feels like the moment you do get pregnant, then you lose your body's autonomy. ""People start touching you and everybody has an opinion on how you should act, what you should wear - everything. ""The only people who should be able to do that should be you and your doctor."" Jaclene said she limited herself to one coffee a day and had taken medical advice about it. She said: ""What if I hadn't been pregnant? ""And there are many postpartum women who find it hard to get rid of their bellies. ""Comments like this can be hurtful so unless someone is having a baby in front of you, you shouldn't get involved. Jaclene is tired of people having a say about her pregnancy She added: ""People feel entitled and your body becomes a community body. ""We're in an exciting but scary time and there's so much information out there which can often be contradictory. However, I trust my body and I will make the best decisions for it. ""What I did find interesting, though, was after I tweeted, many of those who disagreed with my stance were men."" Are you in your 30s and facing 'the swerve'? Does society still pressure women to have children? Modern mothers 'watched and judged' Dr Tara Chettiar says even with her expertise, she was not immune to unsolicited advice during her two pregnancies Among the thousands of women who responded is Dr Tara Chettiar, of Kansas City, a specialist in obstetrics and gynaecology. ""I was in the hospital doing my patient rounds about six years ago, I was heavily pregnant and I was wearing my scrubs and white coat,"" she said. ""As I stopped to get a coffee, one staff member told me that I shouldn't be drinking coffee at all. ""I was astounded that anyone would say that - let alone to an expert in the field.

""I had to pause and say that a small amount of caffeine had been shown to be safe outside of the first trimester. ""In fact, it's fine in the first trimester, although I was visibly beyond that point."" ""I have so many patients who have told me about their experiences around unsolicited advice and as someone who has gone through this myself twice now, I loved seeing how Jaclene had called it out."" She added: ""A lot of pregnant women find they are constantly being told what to do by others but let's be clear: pregnancy is not a disability."" The advice is largely well intentioned, says Dr Chettiar, because it's about an issue everyone feels they can connect with. ""Family, babies are so much at the heart of the human experience. So many people want to become part of the journey. It's the same reason that people also feel they can ask, 'When will you have children?' ""Because in their minds, this is something that connects us all. But in reality, those questions and 'advice' make women feel separate, different, and as though something is wrong with them."" @ethereumgirl also responded to the thread, highlighting the constant touching she had experienced during her pregnancies. Asked why she had wanted to share her experiences on Twitter, she told BBC News: ""I think what pulled me in is this unwanted expectation when you become pregnant that you belong to 'the collective society', that some others feel more comfortable responding to you in ways that would be otherwise socially unacceptable.""

"Boris Johnson is meeting Estonian Prime Minister Juri Ratas in Downing Street The government has rejected claims it is unwilling to negotiate with the EU and wants talks to fail to allow a no-deal Brexit. It comes after the EU said UK demands to remove the Irish backstop from Theresa May's deal were unacceptable. EU negotiators told European diplomats there was currently no basis for ""meaningful discussions"" and talks were back where they were three years ago. Downing Street said the EU needed to ""change its stance"". The European Commission said on Tuesday morning it was willing to hold talks in the coming weeks by phone or in person, ""should the UK wish to clarify its position in more detail"". A spokeswoman added the agreement negotiated by Mrs May - rejected three times by MPs - was the ""best possible deal"", and could not be re-opened. Many opponents of Mrs May's deal cite concerns over the backstop - aninsurance policyto prevent a hard border returning on the island of Ireland - which if implemented, would see Northern Ireland staying aligned to some rules of the EU single market. It would also involve a temporary single customs territory, effectively keeping the whole of the UK in the EU customs union. These arrangements would apply unless and until both the EU and UK agreed they were no longer necessary. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. A No 10 spokesperson said: ""The prime minister wants to meet EU leaders and negotiate a new deal - one that abolishes the anti-democratic backstop. ""We will throw ourselves into the negotiations with the greatest energy and the spirit of friendship and we hope the EU will rethink its current refusal to make any changes to the withdrawal agreement."" New Prime Minister Boris Johnson has pledged to leave the EU by the deadline of 31 October, with or without a deal. No-deal Brexit: What you need to know Extra Â£2.1bn for no-deal Brexit planning 10 ways no-deal Brexit could affect you Is it too late to hold an election before Brexit? BBC Brussels reporter Adam Fleming said the meeting on Sunday between officials and diplomats was a debrief from discussions last week between the EU, UK Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay and Mr Johnson's European envoy, David Frost. A senior EU diplomat told the meeting a no-deal Brexit appeared to be the UK government's ""central scenario"", according to theDaily Telegraph,externaland theGuardian,external. ""It was clear UK does not have another plan. No intention to negotiate, which would require a plan,"" the diplomat is reported to have said. Mr Frost reiterated the prime minister's stance that thebackstop elementof Mrs May's plan must be abolished, and stressed that Mr Johnson's new ministers were not bound by commitments made by the previous government. He also raised concerns about the UK's ""divorce bill"" and the proposed role of the European Court of Justice, the EU's top court, after Brexit. Further talks between the two sides have not been ruled out, and Adam Fleming said the G7 summit in France at the end of August could be the moment of truth - the point at which a no-deal Brexit becomes inevitable. Meanwhile, Mr Johnson is meeting his first foreign leader since entering Downing Street - Estonian Prime Minister Juri Ratas. The country's Foreign Minister, Urmas Reinsalu, said earlier that while the ""reality"" was the withdrawal agreement - including the backstop - had been jointly agreed by EU member states, there was still a need for continued dialogue in the coming weeks to avoid a no-deal Brexit. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme alternatives to the backstop could be discussed after the ratification of the withdrawal deal. The EU is not optimistic about any agreement with the UK. The message they are getting from Boris Johnson's team is that the UK is not going to sign another deal unless it involves getting rid of the backstop. But the EU has been clear time and time again that it isn't going to do that - the backstop is an integral part of any withdrawal agreement and it has to stay. So the conclusion of officials is there is no reason to get back round the table at the moment, for the simple reason that they don't think they can meet the conditions Boris Johnson has set. There are a couple of months to try to eke something out from one of the sides - to see if somebody blinks and there is some room for negotiation either in Brussels or in London. But at the moment, many people think the direction of travel is heading towards a no-deal Brexit. The meeting followsan interview with Health Secretary Matt Hancock, who said he believed Parliament could no longer block the UK from leaving the EU without a deal. In a no-deal scenario, the UK would immediately leave the EU with no agreement about the ""divorce"" process, and would exit overnight from the single market and customs union. Opponents say a no-deal exit would damage the economy and lead to border posts between Northern Ireland and the Republic. Other politicians argue any disruption could be quickly overcome. Prominent pro-EU Conservative Dominic Grieve has insisted there are still a number of options available to MPs to block a no deal - including bringing down the government with a vote of no confidence. He told BBC Radio 5Live the idea that Mr Johnson might refuse to resign even if he lost such a vote and another PM secured the confidence of the Commons was ""breathtaking, stupid, infantile, and it won't work"". ""Quite frankly, I'm astonished to hear these suggestions coming out,"" he added. The foreign secretary is visiting Canada, the US and Mexico this week Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab will begin a tour of North America on Tuesday as part of a bid to ""fire up"" the UK's trade relationships with countries outside the EU. Mr Raab said the foreign ministers he saw at a meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Thailand last week expressed a ""consistent warmth"" for the UK and a ""desire to work more closely with us"". However, the former US treasury secretary, Larry Summers, said the UK was ""delusional"" if it believed it could secure a post-Brexit trade deal with Washington. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Britain has no leverage, Britain is desperate... it needs an agreement very soon. When you have a desperate partner, that's when you strike the hardest bargain.""

"Matt Hancock says he has changed his mind because ""the facts have changed"" Parliament can no longer block a no-deal Brexit, the health secretary has said. During his bid for the Tory leadership, Matt Hancocksaid no deal was ""not an available choice"",externalto the next PM, as MPs ""will never allow it to happen"". He told the BBC he had now changed his mind because they had a chance to block it in a series of votes last month, but failed to muster the numbers. Jeremy Corbyn said Labour would do all it could to stop no deal. But Downing Street insisted the UK would be leaving on 31 October ""whatever the circumstances"", whether a deal had been agreed with the EU or not. ""Politicians cannot choose which votes to respect. They promised to respect the referendum result and we must do,"" No 10 said. Asked whether Mr Johnson would respect the outcome of votes in Parliament - including a vote of no confidence in his government - the spokesman refused to be drawn, calling it a ""hypothetical"" question. MPs have repeatedly rejected the agreement Theresa May reached with Brussels, but have so far failed to coalesce around an alternative. In a no-deal scenario, the UK would immediately leave the EU with no agreement about the ""divorce"" process, overnight exiting the single market and customs union - arrangements designed to help facilitate trade. Opponents say it would damage the economy and lead to border posts between Northern Ireland and the Republic - but other politicians argue any disruption could be quickly overcome. No-deal Brexit: What you need to know Extra Â£2.1bn for no-deal Brexit planning 10 ways a no-deal Brexit could affect you On 12 June, the Commons rejected a motion tabled by Jeremy Corbyn, which would have allowed MPs to take control of the parliamentary timetable in the autumn to stop no deal going through. Mr Hancock told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was that vote which prompted him to change his mind. ""I thought that would go through and in fact, the government won by 11,"" he said. ""I now don't think it can (stop no-deal). I thought that it could and the votes went differently to what I anticipated. When the facts change, sometimes even as a politician you have to change your mind."" Mr Hancock's comments echo a warning reportedly made by the prime minister's senior adviser, Dominic Cummings, that MPs have left it too late to stop no deal. But Dominic Grieve, one of the most prominent pro-European Conservative MPs,told the BBC Mr Cummings was a ""master of misinformation"", and there were a number of options still left for MPs wanting to block no deal. They include bringing down the government, via a vote of no confidence, and setting up a new government in its place, he said. If Mr Johnson loses a vote of no confidence and it becomes clear that another potential prime minister could command the confidence of the Commons, the convention is that he would be obliged to resign. However, Catherine Haddon, from the Institute for Government think tank, said this was ""untested territory"", adding: ""He could say: 'No, I'm staying as prime minister and we're having a general election.'"" The date of an election is set by royal proclamation on the advice of the prime minister, so he could choose a date after 31 October and press on with Brexit in the meantime. Speaking on a visit to Whaley Bridge to seeefforts being made to shore up a damaged dam,Mr Corbyn said Labour would ""do everything to stop no deal, including a no confidence vote at the appropriate, very early, time to do it"". He said Mr Johnson appeared to be ""trying to slip no deal through, slip past Parliament and slip past the British people"", and that was ""not acceptable"".

"This video can not be played 'My heart hurts on every level' The US border city of El Paso is in shock after a gunman apparently drove hundreds of miles to commit an atrocity there. ""I've never been scared of being Hispanic ever before, but now I am,"" says Ivonne Diaz, 31, bursting into tears. ""I can't believe this has happened. El Paso is a city of immigrants and we have always fought for each other."" At 10:30 on a Saturday in August, there is no more ordinary activity than heading to the supermarket. Thousands of people were at the Walmart in El Paso that day. The car park at the border town was full of cars bearing US and Mexican number plates, their drivers and passengers picking up back-to-school supplies or just some bread and milk. Maybe a few beers for the weekend. And then gunshots rang out, killing 20 people. Two more have since died from their injuries. The shockwaves have been reverberating all weekend. â¢Young couple 'gave lives to protect baby son' US stunned by two mass shootings in 24 hours Will anything change this time? ""I'm just worried for the list of names to come out,"" says taxi driver Carla Karam. ""Everyone will have known someone. We all know each other - it's a city of six degrees of separation."" What strikes you here is the friendliness. Strangers are welcomed with open arms - literally in some cases, with hugs being given to journalists along with bottles of water. Memorials have sprung up around the Walmart Cynthia Chavez, 41, says: ""I'm so sad and don't know how we're meant to explain this to our kids. In El Paso, we're the type of people who, if you come to town, we will welcome you with open doors and make you feel part of this town."" Danielle Novoa, 30, who was with her husband, her twin sister and 10-month-old son, says they were heading to the store and were half an hour away when they heard what had happened. ""We knew right away it wouldn't be someone local. There's no way any citizen could live or think that way. ""Being Latina, in a huge Hispanic community, there were times I would think: 'Hey, we could be a target because of how things are now in other states.' But then I never really thought it would happen to us. ""We feel so safe walking out the door in El Paso. But now, we'll be thinking: 'Am I OK to go out and get a gallon of milk? Some diapers for the baby?'"" The Novoa family hold a sign commemorating the victims of the attack Julio Novoa, her husband, says: ""We've always been proud of the fact we accept the diversity of being Mexican-Americans and US citizens. And we all get on so well. ""We were targeted because we're the best of what unity and diversity means. They know we are representative of how America really can be. And because of that, it doesn't surprise me that a white supremacist would want to target us."" Others visit the makeshift memorial behind the Walmart store with their own tributes. There are flowers, teddy bears, and signs proclaiming ""El Paso Strong"". There are tears, too, for those who died and for the shattered innocence of the community. Deena Delgado, 26, who is there with her 10-month-old daughter Aerie, is weeping as she tells how her brother and niece were in Walmart at the time of the shooting. They were contemplating looking for one more item to buy when shots were fired. She fears her niece, seven, will be left traumatised. Everyone speaks of the need for the city to come together. They say they will unite and come back stronger than before. And one of the major talking points is the issue of gun control. Jose Rijos, who has lived in the city for more than 30 years, says: ""As long as we have hatred and we have a way to release that anger through guns, we're not going to have the answer. But we have the combination right now to cause this - we have the hatred and we have guns. And this is the result."" Signs and flowers were left at a roadside near the site of the shooting But Willa Melendez says: ""I know there's going to be a lot of people doing applications for carrying guns after this. I think that's the reality. It shouldn't be that way, but it's got to that."" She says her sister had just left Walmart when the shooting happened. ""We were on the freeway when I found out. I called everybody to check up on them, everybody,"" she says. ""My 26-year-old grandson got stuck at the mall, where he was working. He's not doing so well. He didn't sleep last night. We're so near the border here - we don't consider it two different countries. ""So this hurts. It hurts."" People take part in a rally against hate a day after the shooting Jonas Porras, 19, speaks of the suspected gunman, who is just a few years older than him. ""The thought of coming here, of all places, coming here and disturbing the peaceâ¦ Why not leave alone what's not to be broken? But I think this makes us stronger. It makes us who we are. We're going to pull through."" He had been on his way to Walmart when the cars in front of him started turning around, so he followed suit. ""I feel very blessed at the moment,"" he adds. America's gun culture in 10 charts Four dates that explain the US gun debate As night fell, vigils were held in the city. Thousands turned out at the events to remember those who died and to join together as one community. This video can not be played A soldier and a baseball coach recall how they tried to save children from the El Paso shooting In Ponder Park, a short distance from Walmart, hundreds upon hundreds filled the Little League field. There was a multi-faith procession before people's voices joined together in song, holding phone torches aloft. One of the biggest cheers was for three Walmart employees hailed as the heroes of the community for saving countless lives. They wept on stage as their bravery was applauded. And Democratic presidential candidate and El Paso native Beto O'Rourke was among the speakers at a rally at the city's Las Americas headquarters, following a silent walk of remembrance. He was cheered as he called for an end to gun violence, alongside the parents of Joaquin Oliver, who died in the Parkland shooting in 2018. Today would have been Joaquin's birthday. Vigils were held in El Paso over the weekend As Happy Birthday was sung, people were in tears, the joint tragedies bringing them together. Butterflies were released, flying between and fluttering around people's heads. It was a reminder of the grim list of names this city joins. People held their banners again as they left the rally. One of them read: ""Shaken, not broken."" El Paso is not the kind of place where this happens. That's what its residents repeat, over and over again. The queues to give blood to the injured, with people happily waiting for hours? That's El Paso. Coming out in their thousands at a candlelit vigil to sing Amazing Grace? That's El Paso. A community coming together in one of its darkest moments to vow this can never happen again? That's El Paso.

"The new hospital has yet to open its doors to patients Scotland's health secretary has offered assurances over Edinburgh's problem-hit new Â£150m children's hospital. Jeane Freeman said work to establish the extent of problems with ventilation and drainage were ""on track"". She shared hopes for a phased migration to the new site once safety reports were completed by September. It comes after a senior trade union official warned the building, which has yet to open its doors to patients,might have to be ""ripped down"". Sick Children's Hospital in Edinburgh review ordered Union warns Edinburgh's Â£150m hospital may never open Millions paid out for unused Sick Children's Hospital in Edinburgh The new Royal Hospital for Children and Young People, which will have more than 200 beds, was supposed to open in July, but Ms Freeman overruled NHS Lothian after last-minute inspections found safety concerns over its ventilation system. A full safety review of the new building was commissioned to assess the water, ventilation and drainage systems. The NHS-led review is due to be finished by September but no opening date for the hospital has been given. Following concerns over the site, Ms Freeman insisted ""we need to deal with facts"". She toldBBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotlandprogramme that she ""did not yet know"" whether ventilation in critical care would need to be completely replaced. The minister said she is ""accountable"" for what happens in the health service Ms Freeman explained: ""We're on track with the timetable that I set out [in July]. ""I think the key thing to do at this point is to work our way through, hear what information we get from the reviews and then determine at that stage, most importantly, whether or not there are areas of the hospital where it is safe to migrate services. ""I just want to be absolutely sure before we move on that we are compliant across all those areas in that new site. ""That compliance, with the exception of the ventilation of the critical care area, will help trigger I hope a phased migration of services into the new hospital from the existing site and indeed from the Western General - but I won't know that until I have results of that work from Health Protection Scotland and Health Facilities Scotland."" Last weekBBC Scotland revealedthat NHS Lothian was paying millions of pounds to a private consortium for a hospital it cannot use. And while Ms Freeman said issues on drainage were ""resolved"", Unison Scotland's health committee Tom Waterson said senior staff within NHS Lothian had raised concerns over drainage in the last two or three weeks. He said the problems date back 18 to 36 months when senior staff were ""alerted to shortcomings in the drainage"". But despite that the contractors continued to press ahead with construction. Hazard app 'to save construction workers' lives' Ms Freeman said she had asked for a number of ""other critical areas"" to be double checked to make sure they were compliant with all standards and that would include drainage. She added ""I've been very careful, as I should be, to make sure local MSPs and MPs are kept informed with everything I have done so far and I will inform them as that information becomes available. ""To inform the parliament, I have written to all the staff involved and I have given the staff my absolute personal assurance that when I have the information they will have the information - and of course all of that includes the health and sport committee."" The new hospital will provide care for children and young people It is not yet known whether the ventilation in the critical care unit will need to be improved or completely replaced. However, Ms Freeman said once a cost was established, work would be carried out. She said: ""I don't know the cost just yet because that work I have outlined has to take its course and we have to then deal with facts. ""Once we have the facts about how we replace and improve the existing ventilation then we will have a cost associated with that, and we will do that work. ""Technicians, designers and engineers are working right at this moment to look at what exactly is the right fix for this without unnecessarily disrupting other areas of the build."" Prof Alex McMahon, nurse director at NHS Lothian, said: ""There are a number of independent reviews and investigations under way to verify and provide assurance that all aspects of the Royal Hospital for Children and Young People, the Department of Clinical Neurosciences, and Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services meet the appropriate standards before it becomes operational. ""The decision to delay the move followed the identification of a problem with ventilation in critical care. Given the pause in occupation, the commissioned reviews will focus on ventilation and will also look at drainage and water systems as a priority. ""An Oversight Board, made up of Scottish government, NHS Lothian, National Services Scotland and Scottish Futures Trust, has been established in order to provide co-ordinated advice on the readiness of the hospital to open and on the migration of services to the new facility. ""The reviews and subsequent reports will be provided to the cabinet secretary for health and NHS Lothian.""

"Joy Morgan was a student midwife at the University of Hertfordshire A married father has been jailed for 17 years for murdering a student midwife who went to his church. Shohfah-El Israel, 40, was convicted by a jury at Reading Crown Court of killing 20-year-old Joy Morgan. Ms Morgan was last seen on 26 December at a church event in Ilford. Her body has never been found. Judge Michael Soole said Israel's ""cruel and cowardly"" refusal to reveal her whereabouts caused ""continuing distress and suffering"" to her family. Sentencing Israel to life with a minimum of 17 years, the judge said: ""Only you know the circumstances of your terrible deed and why you did it. ""You are evidently an intelligent man and have said nothing beyond the lies and the explanations which the jury has rejected."" In a victim impact statement read out to the court her mother Carol Morgan described the Hertfordshire University student as her ""shining light and my superstar"". Shohfah-El Israel was convicted by a jury at Reading Crown Court The court heard Israel had spent time alone with Ms Morgan, of Hatfield, Hertfordshire, in December, breaching church rules which banned women from being with men other than their husbands. He initially told police he had dropped off Ms Morgan at her student accommodation in Hatfield after a celebratory dinner at the church, but later admitted she had spent two nights at his flat in Cricklewood in north-west London. A signal from Ms Morgan's phone, which has never been found, was detected in Israel's car in the Stevenage area on 28 December. He was ""most likely looking for somewhere to dispose of the body"", prosecutors told the jury. The keys to the student's accommodation were found in the footwell of Israel's car after his arrest in February. Israel, who denied having sex with Ms Morgan, had sent her messages in March 2018 calling her ""an amazing princess"" and ""a treasure that cannot be measured"". Both were worshippers at the Israel United in Christ Church in Ilford, though Israel claimed Ms Morgan had been thinking of leaving. A signal from Ms Morgan's mobile phone was detected in Shohfah-El Israel's car on 28 December The jury was not told Israel had allegedly had flirtatious exchanges with other church members before and after the student midwife's disappearance, using lines from chat-up manuals. Despite church members saying they were surprised at Ms Morgan's apparent departure, they did not report her missing. It was Ms Morgan's mother, who is not a member of the church, who reported her disappearance to police on 7 February, six weeks after she was last seen. In a victim impact statement her mother described the student midwife as ""such a wonderful person, selfless, caring, loved by so many"" who would have been ""an amazing midwife"". ""She would always look after me when I came home after a long shift, cooking lovely home-cooked meals,"" she added.

"Jaclene Paolucci, pictured with her husband, John, says she does not know why complete strangers feel they have the right to advise her on her pregnancy Six months into her pregnancy, Jaclene Paolucci has had enough of strangers offering unsolicited advice and thinking it's fine to touch her without permission.

"Boris Johnson has given the green light to 20 new building and infrastructure projects in the NHS in England. The Â£850m package will pay for new wards, intensive care units and diagnostic centres as well as refurbishing some existing facilities over the next five years. Mr Johnson also said there would be an extra Â£1bn this year to improve and maintain existing buildings. But doubts have been raised over whether the money really is new. Mr Johnson said the Â£1bn for this year was extra - and would mean ""more beds, new wards, and extra life-saving equipment"". It will bring spending to Â£7bn during 2019-20. Is NHS buildings boost all it seems? When asked about staffing and recruitment problems faced by hospitals, Mr Johnson said the Â£1.8bn was ""on top of the Â£34bn that we're putting into the NHS"". ""But of course the lion's share of that will go on staffing, attracting, retaining, professionally developing the staff in the NHS,"" he said. He previously said he was ""determined to deliver"" on the promises of the 2016 EU referendum, after criticism of the Vote Leave campaign's claim that Â£350m a week was being sent to the EU and could be spent on the NHS instead. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the NHS was ""priority number one"" for the new prime minister. He said money for hospital upgrades was possible because the economy was growing and the funds would be available this year. Analysis by Nick Triggle, health correspondent The government has always promised it would be increasing capital funding in 2019-20. Last year's Budget said spending would rise from Â£5.9bn in 2018-19 to Â£6.7bn in the new financial year. But that was subsequently reduced. By the time Boris Johnson became prime minister, the plan was to spend Â£5.9bn again. After Monday's announcement that now increases to Â£7bn. So is the money new? Well certainly Â£300m of it is - and if you are being generous you could argue Â£1bn of it is from the situation when Mr Johnson took office. But even if we accept that it is all new money it is not a given that it will all end up improving the infrastructure of the health service. During the past five years, about Â£5bn less has been spent on capital than had been planned for. This is because significant sums - about a sixth of the capital budget - have been transferred into the day-to-day running pot to help balance the books. The truth is it will be at the end of the financial year only that we will be able to see whether this promised money has gone where it should - and even if it does, it could be argued it is just reversing the cuts seen in the past few years. Read more from Nick here Responding to the funding announcement, the Health Foundation said ""years of under-investment in the NHS's infrastructure means this extra money risks being little more than a drop in the ocean"". Ben Gershlick, from the charity, added that NHS facilities in England were ""in major disrepair"", with a Â£6bn maintenance backlog. Labour's shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said there was ""huge scepticism"" about whether the funding was new. Meanwhile, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the announcement today on funding for the NHS ""goes nowhere near paying for all the cuts over the past nine years"". Mr Corbyn said ""many hospitals had been left off"" and ""we need something a bit more comprehensive"". But the head of NHS England, Simon Stevens, said the money was a ""significant start"" to ""much needed capital investment"". ""The concrete steps being set out this week will mean investment flows directly to front-line services, providing new clinics and wards,"" he added. The prime minister announced the funding package on a visit to Pilgrim Hospital in Boston, Lincolnshire, which is receiving a Â£21.3m share of the money to improve its A&E department. Andrew Morgan, chief executive of United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust, which runs the hospital, told Radio 4's WATO programme that it was ""a small step, but a very positive one"". ""We have a huge backlog maintenance bill here,"" he said. Mr Morgan explained that staffing was still his top priority. But some hospitals, such as Liverpool Women's Hospital, missed out on funding. Its interim medical director Andrew Loughney said they needed Â£100m to rebuild the hospital, which he called ""a clinical priority"". ""Perhaps if we were in a marginal constituency, we would have been allocated the money,"" he said. The government said other parts of the UK would benefit too. Health is devolved, so Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland make decisions about spending on the NHS. But under funding rules there would be money made available to them, ministers said. Later this week, the government is also expected to announce changes to the NHS pension scheme after senior doctors said new rules meant they could not afford to work extra shifts to tackle waiting lists. One hospital said the rule change, which means ""punitive"" taxes for doctors who take additional shifts and exceed the limit for pensions contributions, wasthe equivalent of losing 60 consultants.

"India has deployed tens of thousands of troops to Indian-administered Kashmir in recent days India's government has revoked part of the constitution that gives Indian-administered Kashmir special status, prompting fears of unrest. Article 370 is sensitive because it guarantees significant autonomy for the Muslim-majority state. The measure was accompanied by a telecoms and media blackout which began on Sunday evening. There is a long-running insurgency on the Indian side. India and Pakistan fought several conflicts over Kashmir. For many Kashmiris, Article 370 was the main justification for being a part of India and by revoking it, the BJP has irrevocably changed Delhi's relationship with the region, the BBC's Geeta Pandey reports from Delhi. Meanwhile India's parliament is expected to pass a bill splitting Indian-administered Kashmir into two territories governed directly by Delhi. Pakistan condemned India's decision to revoke the special status of its part of Kashmir as illegal, saying it would ""exercise all possible options"" to counter it. ""India is playing a dangerous game which will have serious consequences for regional peace and stability,"" said Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi. Why India and Pakistan dispute Kashmir Why a special law on Kashmir is controversial Modi's Kashmir move will fuel resentment 'India has betrayed Kashmir' But an Indian government source said there was no external implication as the Line of Control, the de facto border, and boundaries of Kashmir had not been altered. During the partition of the Indian subcontinent in 1947, some expected Jammu and Kashmir, like other Muslim-majority regions, to go to Pakistan. But the ruler of the princely state, who had initially wanted Jammu and Kashmir to become independent, joined India in return for help against an invasion of tribesmen from Pakistan. War broke out between India and Pakistan, and Kashmir effectively became partitioned. The region, which remains one of the most militarised zones in the world, has been a flashpoint between India and Pakistan for more than six decades. By Aamir Peerzada, BBC News, Srinagar By the time we woke up this morning, the internet was gone and we now have no mobile connectivity. If people step out of their homes, they see paramilitary forces on every street. Almost every major road is shut - we are hearing that more troops are being deployed. No-one knows what is happening in other parts of the state - we can't talk to anyone else. People are concerned - they don't know what is happening, they don't know what is going to happen. It's an atmosphere of fear. People are scared to come out, they have stockpiled food for months. Kashmiris have always been willing to defend the state's special status. It looks like a long road ahead, and no-one knows what's next. In 1949, a special provision was added to India's constitution providing autonomy to Jammu and Kashmir. Article 370 allows the state to have its own constitution, a separate flag and independence over all matters except foreign affairs, defence and communications. Another provision later added under Article 370 - 35A - gives special privileges to permanent residents, including state government jobs and the exclusive right to own property in the state. It is seen as protecting the state's distinct demographic character as the only Muslim-majority state in India. The move by the Hindu nationalist BJP government prompted outrage in parliament, and some legal experts have called it an attack on the constitution. Critics fear the move is designed to change the demographic make-up of India-administered Kashmir - by giving people from the rest of the country to right to acquire property and settle there permanently. The state'sformer chief minister, Mehbooba Mufti, told the BBC she felt there was a ""sinister design"" to the decision. ""They just want to occupy our land and want to make this Muslim-majority state like any other state and reduce us to a minority and disempower us totally."" The ruling BJP made revoking Article 370 part of the party's 2019 election manifesto - and it won a landslide victory earlier this year. It has argued that Article 370 has prevented the region's development and its integration with India. Supporters of India's ruling BJP have been celebrating the move An Indian government source told journalists the region's special status had discouraged outside investment and affected its economy, while terrorism and smuggling were rife. ""A set of anachronistic provisions were not allowing the progress of Kashmir,"" the source said. ""The huge sum of money and resources which were going into the state were not being optimised."" India's government announced a presidential order revoking all of Article 370 apart from one clause which says that the state is an integral part of India. The order was met by massive protests from the opposition - but has now been signed into law by President Ram Nath Kovind. Prior to the announcement, a telecoms and media blackout began on Sunday evening in the region. The government explained the move as being aimed at pre-empting any violence that the announcement might trigger. Officials said the restrictions would not be in place for long. Opponents of the move have also been out in the streets of Delhi Parliament is also expected to approve a measure dividing the state into two regions ruled by the central government. One region will combine Muslim-majority Kashmir and Hindu-majority Jammu. The other is Buddhist-majority Ladakh, which is culturally and historically close to Tibet. The forgotten victims of the world's highest war The funerals driving youth to militancy Indian-administered Kashmir is in a state of lockdown. Curfew-like conditions have been imposed, and orders preventing the assembly of more than four people have been introduced. Tens of thousands of Indian troops were deployed to the region ahead of Monday's announcement and tourists were told to leave under warnings of a terror threat. This video can not be played In December Yogita Limaye examined why there had been a rise in violence in Kashmir In the hours before Monday's announcement, two of the state's former chief ministers - Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti - were placed under house arrest.

"Accountancy firm BDO has been appointed administrators to Harland and Wolff, a spokesman for the Belfast shipyard has said. An insolvency request is expected to be filed at the High Court in Belfast on Tuesday. The move puts 120 jobs at risk and could spell the end of the iconic firm, best known for building the Titanic. Union sources said staff were given redundancy notices saying the business will cease trading on Monday evening. This video can not be played The history of the Belfast shipyard A week ago, workers said they had taken control of the site and established a rota to ensure their protest continued around the clock. After the administrators were appointed on Monday, workers said their protest would continue. At a press conference, trade unionists representing staff warned they will stand against the DUP in a forthcoming general election if the party does not do more to support workers. Unions representing H&W workers held a press conference on Monday Harland and Wolff's best known vessel is the Titanic, which was built at the yard between 1909 and 1911. At its height, Harland and Wolff employed more than 30,000 people. The firm had been up for sale amid serious financial problems at its Norwegian owner. Shipyard crisis 'a commercial issue' Council calls for support for Harland and Wolff Unions representing workers have called for the shipyard to be nationalised, arguing that it would be cheaper for the government to keep the shipyard open. However, the government has said the crisis is ""ultimately a commercial issue"". East Belfast MP Gavin Robinson, from the DUP, said officials had advised against government intervention. ""We've pulled all the political levers that we can,"" he told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme. DUP MP Gavin Robinson said government intervention would conflict with state aid rules The MP said Harland and Wolff had asked the government for shortfall funding of Â£650,000, which would have given the company ""breathing space"" for the month of August ""so that they could explore other options"". But he added: ""The official advice is that it cannot be done for three reasons: there is no order book at present so the money would be going in with no generation of product or profit; and there was no ability to secure the loans or pay them back; and it would also conflict with state aid rules."" Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said Labour would have nationalised the shipyard and he accused the government of betraying the workers. John McDonnell said Harland and Wolff could win future Navy contracts Mr McDonnell, who visited Harland and Wolff staff in Belfast on Monday, said the shipyard has the potential for future work. He said he saw no reason why naval ships could not be built in Belfast in the future, in order to maintain the skills and capacity at Harland and Wolff. The Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU) said the shipyard ""should be returned to the people"". ""The entire trade union movement across these islands stands as one with the workers at the shipyard,"" said ICTU assistant general secretary, Owen Reidy. The HMS Eagle was launched by Princess Elizabeth in March 1946 The shipyard was founded in 1861 by Yorkshireman Edward Harland and a German, Gustav Wolff. By the early 20th Century, it was the world's most prolific builder of ocean liners. It was one of Northern Ireland's key industrial assets during World War Two, producing 140 warships, 123 merchant ships and more than 500 tanks. Its workforce reached a peak in the post-war years when it employed about 35,000 people. By the late 1950s, the yard was facing increased global competition and the impact of the rise of air travel. The Canberra was built for P&O to sail between London and Sydney The launch of the Canberra in 1960 marked the last cruise liner to be built in Belfast. By the mid-1960s the business was in serious decline. At one stage in 1966, the management went to the old Stormont government and pleaded for a subsidy because it did not have enough money to cover the next pay day. That was the start of more than 30 years of subsidies, during which about Â£1bn of taxpayers' money was pumped into Harland and Wolff to keep it afloat. The firm was nationalised in 1975 with the Northern Ireland Office minister, Stan Orme, describing the business as having ""a sorry financial record"". Much of the shipyard's work in recent years has been in the construction of offshore wind turbines By that stage it was still employing about 10,000 people. It returned to private ownership in 1989 through a management-employee buyout, backed by the Norwegian industrialist Fred Olsen. It increasingly focused on the oil and gas sectors, but struggled to compete against major shipbuilders in east Asia. The Anvil Point beneath the Harland and Wolff cranes after it was built in 2003 The yard built its last ship in 2003 - a Ministry of Defence ferry called the Anvil Point. Since then, it has worked on other areas of marine engineering such as oil rig refurbishment and offshore wind turbines. The administrators will try to restart a sales process. There is likely to be some interest. The Newry firm, MJM, that specialises in ship fitout, is a potential bidder. At least one property company is also interested in the business. But the future is not bright for the workforce, even if the business is sold to a new industrial operator. The history of the Belfast shipyard.

"Joy Morgan was a student midwife at the University of Hertfordshire A married father has been jailed for 17 years for murdering a student midwife who went to his church. Shohfah-El Israel, 40, was convicted by a jury at Reading Crown Court of killing 20-year-old Joy Morgan. Ms Morgan was last seen on 26 December at a church event in Ilford. Her body has never been found. Judge Michael Soole said Israel's ""cruel and cowardly"" refusal to reveal her whereabouts caused ""continuing distress and suffering"" to her family. Sentencing Israel to life with a minimum of 17 years, the judge said: ""Only you know the circumstances of your terrible deed and why you did it. ""You are evidently an intelligent man and have said nothing beyond the lies and the explanations which the jury has rejected."" In a victim impact statement read out to the court her mother Carol Morgan described the Hertfordshire University student as her ""shining light and my superstar"". Shohfah-El Israel was convicted by a jury at Reading Crown Court The court heard Israel had spent time alone with Ms Morgan, of Hatfield, Hertfordshire, in December, breaching church rules which banned women from being with men other than their husbands. He initially told police he had dropped off Ms Morgan at her student accommodation in Hatfield after a celebratory dinner at the church, but later admitted she had spent two nights at his flat in Cricklewood in north-west London. A signal from Ms Morgan's phone, which has never been found, was detected in Israel's car in the Stevenage area on 28 December. He was ""most likely looking for somewhere to dispose of the body"", prosecutors told the jury. The keys to the student's accommodation were found in the footwell of Israel's car after his arrest in February. Israel, who denied having sex with Ms Morgan, had sent her messages in March 2018 calling her ""an amazing princess"" and ""a treasure that cannot be measured"". Both were worshippers at the Israel United in Christ Church in Ilford, though Israel claimed Ms Morgan had been thinking of leaving. A signal from Ms Morgan's mobile phone was detected in Shohfah-El Israel's car on 28 December The jury was not told Israel had allegedly had flirtatious exchanges with other church members before and after the student midwife's disappearance, using lines from chat-up manuals. Despite church members saying they were surprised at Ms Morgan's apparent departure, they did not report her missing. It was Ms Morgan's mother, who is not a member of the church, who reported her disappearance to police on 7 February, six weeks after she was last seen. In a victim impact statement her mother described the student midwife as ""such a wonderful person, selfless, caring, loved by so many"" who would have been ""an amazing midwife"". ""She would always look after me when I came home after a long shift, cooking lovely home-cooked meals,"" she added.

"Britain's largest supermarket, Tesco, has increased the price of more than 1,000 products in the past two weeks. The firm raised prices on products including cheese, chocolate and bananas by an average of 11%, according to the Press Association. Tesco says it held off raising prices for as long as it could, and insists it is still competitive when compared to Asda, Sainsbury's and Morrisons. It comes as rivals Aldi and Lidl put pressure on the big four supermarkets. All shops are having to deal with increases in the cost of the goods they sell. The prices of milk powder, potatoes and pork have all risen much faster than the official inflation figure of 2%. ""There's a lot of tension between the need be competitive and the need to boost margins,"" said independent retail expert Richard Hyman. In October 2016, Tesco's chief executive Dave Lewis promised to get profit margins up to 3.5%- 4% by 2020. ""Now it's less than six months away,"" Mr Hyman says, ""the pressure is on."" A weak pound is partly to blame, as it means that it costs more to import goods. ""Over recent months, cost pressures have continued to build and impact the market,"" Tesco said in a statement. ""We've worked hard to offset these pressures, and focused on protecting our customers for as long as possible. But, like the wider market, we have had to reflect these pressures in the price of some products. ""For the majority of products that have increased in price over the last three weeks, we still beat or match the cheapest of the big 4."" The Press Association found that a pack of five bananas is now Â£1, up from 90p, and own-brand pasta rose to 65p from 50p. However, Tesco has also dropped prices on 121 lines during the past three weeks, including some wines and soft drinks.

It increasingly focused on the oil and gas sectors, but struggled to compete against major shipbuilders in east Asia. The Anvil Point beneath the Harland and Wolff cranes after it was built in 2003 The yard built its last ship in 2003 - a Ministry of Defence ferry called the Anvil Point. Since then, it has worked on other areas of marine engineering such as oil rig refurbishment and offshore wind turbines. The administrators will try to restart a sales process. There is likely to be some interest. The Newry firm, MJM, that specialises in ship fitout, is a potential bidder. At least one property company is also interested in the business. But the future is not bright for the workforce, even if the business is sold to a new industrial operator. The history of the Belfast shipyard.

"Supermarket giant Tesco says about 4,500 staff in 153 Tesco Metro stores are set to lose their jobs in the latest round of redundancies. The UK's largest grocer said changes to the way the stores operated would ""serve shoppers better"" and help to ""run our business more sustainably"". It said the stores were operating in an increasingly competitive and challenging retail environment. Tesco boss Jason Tarry said the firm did not take the jobs decision lightly. The company said the Metro format was originally designed for larger, weekly shops, but now nearly 70% of customers used them as convenience stores, buying food for that day. Tesco, which employs about 340,000 people in the UK and Republic of Ireland, said that changes to the stores would now include: ""faster and simpler"" ways of filling shelves, with fewer products stored in the back rooms and more stock going straight to the shop floor staff working ""more flexibly"" across the store to improve customer service at the busiest times of the day and in the right areas of the store ""leaner"" management structure. ""In a challenging, evolving retail environment, with increasing cost pressures, we have to continue to review the way we run our stores to ensure we reflect the way our customers are shopping and do so in the most efficient way,"" Mr Tarry added. Tesco Metro shops are sized between Tesco superstores and Tesco Express shops. They first opened in 1994. Tesco raises prices on 1,000 products Tesco profits jump in uncertain market Tesco counter cost cuts to hit 9,000 jobs It is also making some changes in 134 of its 1,750 Express stores, where customer footfall is lower. Changes in those stores will include ""a slight reduction in opening hours during quieter trading periods at the start and end of the day, and simplifying stock routines"". Tesco is in the midst of trying to save Â£1.5bn as the competition between supermarkets intensifies. It comes as German budget rivals Aldi and Lidl continue to put pressure on the big four supermarkets. In January, Tesco announced it would close food counters in 90 of its stores as part of a wider cost-cutting plan that would affect 9,000 staff. Tesco said then that its remaining fish, meat and deli counters in 700 stores would be run on a full-time or flexible basis. It has also opened a discount chain, Jack's, to take on its German rivals. Pauline Foulkes, Usdaw national officer, said: ""Our members at Tesco are shocked and dismayed by yet another round of potential job losses, coming just months after 9,000 staff were put at risk in stores. ""We will be working hard to make sure that any members potentially affected by these proposals are supported at this difficult time and throughout the consultation period. ""This issue is not confined to Tesco, our High Streets are in crisis, with jobs being lost due to shops closing, retailers folding and businesses engaging in significant restructuring to survive. ""We need the government to address the worries and concerns of shop workers and our members.""

"Joy Morgan was a student midwife at the University of Hertfordshire A married father has been jailed for 17 years for murdering a student midwife who went to his church. Shohfah-El Israel, 40, was convicted by a jury at Reading Crown Court of killing 20-year-old Joy Morgan. Ms Morgan was last seen on 26 December at a church event in Ilford. Her body has never been found. Judge Michael Soole said Israel's ""cruel and cowardly"" refusal to reveal her whereabouts caused ""continuing distress and suffering"" to her family. Sentencing Israel to life with a minimum of 17 years, the judge said: ""Only you know the circumstances of your terrible deed and why you did it. ""You are evidently an intelligent man and have said nothing beyond the lies and the explanations which the jury has rejected."" In a victim impact statement read out to the court her mother Carol Morgan described the Hertfordshire University student as her ""shining light and my superstar"". Shohfah-El Israel was convicted by a jury at Reading Crown Court The court heard Israel had spent time alone with Ms Morgan, of Hatfield, Hertfordshire, in December, breaching church rules which banned women from being with men other than their husbands. He initially told police he had dropped off Ms Morgan at her student accommodation in Hatfield after a celebratory dinner at the church, but later admitted she had spent two nights at his flat in Cricklewood in north-west London. A signal from Ms Morgan's phone, which has never been found, was detected in Israel's car in the Stevenage area on 28 December. He was ""most likely looking for somewhere to dispose of the body"", prosecutors told the jury. The keys to the student's accommodation were found in the footwell of Israel's car after his arrest in February. Israel, who denied having sex with Ms Morgan, had sent her messages in March 2018 calling her ""an amazing princess"" and ""a treasure that cannot be measured"". Both were worshippers at the Israel United in Christ Church in Ilford, though Israel claimed Ms Morgan had been thinking of leaving. A signal from Ms Morgan's mobile phone was detected in Shohfah-El Israel's car on 28 December The jury was not told Israel had allegedly had flirtatious exchanges with other church members before and after the student midwife's disappearance, using lines from chat-up manuals. Despite church members saying they were surprised at Ms Morgan's apparent departure, they did not report her missing. It was Ms Morgan's mother, who is not a member of the church, who reported her disappearance to police on 7 February, six weeks after she was last seen. In a victim impact statement her mother described the student midwife as ""such a wonderful person, selfless, caring, loved by so many"" who would have been ""an amazing midwife"".

"Actress Emma Watson has helped launch afree legal advice phone line for women,externalwho have experienced sexual harassment at work. The Time's Up UK activist said it was ""completely staggering"" the new service was the only one of its kind in England and Wales. The line has been funded by donations from the public, including Watson. Research from the TUC union found as many as one in two women experienced sexual harassment in the workplace. Watson said it ""finally feels like people are realising the scale of the problem"", and she was ""certainly hopeful"" of starting to see ""a new climate of prevention and accountability"" in the UK. Woman who recorded lewd call from boss spared jail 'Abuse and harassment' in Russia evokes #metoo Crackdown on workplace 'gagging clauses' Women who call the line will be able to get specialist legal advice on issues including: What behaviour constitutes sexual harassment How to bring a grievance against an employer How to make a claim in an employment tribunal How to address settlement agreements and non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) The legal advice is provided by Rights of Women - a charity which works to help women through the law. The scheme is backed by the Time's Up UK Justice and Equality Fund, and managed by Rosa - the UK Fund for Women and Girls. Watson said: ""Understanding what your rights are, how you can assert them, and the choices you have if you've experienced harassment is such a vital part of creating safe workplaces for everyone. ""This advice line is such a huge development in ensuring that all women are supported, wherever we work."" The phone line will run on Mondays from 18:00 BST to 20:00, and Tuesdays 17:00 to 19:00. Anyone who experiences sexual harassment at work in the UK is protected by theEquality Act 2010,external. In some cases, telling someone their behaviour is making you uncomfortable may be enough to stop it, and confiding in a colleague at work could also help you to decide what to do. If not, you can: Tell your manager - Citizen's Advice suggests you put this in writing and keep a copy Keep a diary recording the harassment, when it happened and who witnessed it Speak to your HR department or trade union, who can offer advice - you can stay anonymous if you choose Make a formal complaint - all employers are required to have a grievance procedure - where you can set out in writing the ""who"", ""what"", and ""where"" of the harassment and how it made you feel If these options don't work, you can make a claim to an employment tribunal. Source: Slater and Gordon employment solicitors The Government Equalities Office told the BBC it ""welcomed"" the launch of the new phone line. Last month, the governmentset out new plans to protect employees from sexual harassment in the workplace,external. Penny Mordaunt - who was the minister for Women and Equalities until last month - announced measures to strengthen the existing law, giving explicit protections to workers against harassment from third parties.

"About 7,000 litres of water a minute are being pumped from the reservoir Crews need to spend at least two more days pumping water from a reservoir to stop its dam bursting and flooding a town, firefighters have said. Whaley Bridge residents are spending a fifth day out of their homes because of the partial collapse of the dam wall. Toddbrook Reservoir is 46% full but needs to drop to 25% before the 1,500 people evacuated are allowed home. The government said it was considering a national review into the structural safety of dams across the country. The Department for Environmental, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said the focus was on Whaley Bridge but it would be ""following the advice of expert engineers on the best way forward"". Photos show how the water levels at the reservoir have dropped since Friday Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has visited the dam, following Boris Johnson's visit on Friday. Escorted by High Peak's Labour MP Ruth George, Mr Corbyn thanked emergency service workers for their efforts, expressed sympathy to residents and said an inquiry would need to take place. ""Hopefully people will be able to return to their homes but of course there has to be then the question of long-term repair to the dam and the safety of it in the future,"" he said. ""There has to be an inquiry. An inquiry to make sure all the co-ordination worked effectively, and everything I have seen shows it did, but there are always lessons to be learned."" This video can not be played Whaley Bridge: Couple evacuated days before wedding The dam is said to be ""relatively stable"" after four days of efforts to bolster it. But Derbyshire deputy chief fire officer Gavin Tomlinson said the operation would continue ""for a few days yet"". Crews using 23 high-volume pumps have removed more than a third of the reservoir's water since part of its spillway collapsed on Thursday following heavy rainfall. Jeremy Corbyn was given the latest on the operation to pump water from the reservoir Mr Tomlinson said: ""We're now below half the level we want and we're now aiming for about 25%. ""If the calculations are right we should be able to get below the level of the damage on the dam wall which will allow the engineers and the specialists to assess it. ""As soon as we get the water level down to a safe level, then the emergency phase is over and then the contractors can look at the repairing of the dam wall."" This video can not be played Drone footage shows Whaley Bridge's new road RAF Chinooks have dropped more than 500 tonnes of aggregate into the damaged section of the wall to reinforce it. Wing Cdr John Coles said: ""I think the assessment is now that actually the dam is relatively stable."" By Keith Doyle, BBC News Much of the town lies beneath the reservoir's water level A quiet rural field at the edge of the Toddbrook reservoir is now at the centre of a massive engineering operation, with 10 high-volume pumps in a line along a hastily constructed road. In the water there are another 12 pumps submerged, and every so often as the water levels drop they have to be turned off and moved back into the water. Locals have moved cars and livestock and allowed the emergency services to break down walls and fences to get access. They say any inconvenience they are experiencing is nothing compared to what the evacuated residents from the other side of the dam are going through, and in the meantime they are supplying food and drinks to workers from the safe side of the reservoir. While this is not over, there is a feeling among the emergency services - and the locals that have come to watch the operation - that the critical dangerous stage has passed. The Canal and River Trust, which owns the dam,said it carried out an annual inspection of the structure in Novemberand it was ""absolutely fine"". Watersafe UK, a charity specialising in search and rescue operations, said it had 20 teams on standby to assist if the dam burst. RAF Chinooks have dropped more than 500 tonnes of aggregate Rachel Swann said people refusing to leave their homes were putting themselves and officers in danger Police have sharply criticised 20 residents from 16 homes who are refusing to leave. Deputy Chief Constable Rachel Swann said: ""We've evacuated this because there is a real prospect that the dam could fail, and if it fails it is catastrophic. ""People would die if they were in that evacuation zone. So those people who remain in that zone are putting their lives at risk. ""They are also putting the lives of the responders, primarily the police, at risk because we have to keep going in and speaking to them and asking them to leave."" 'We have nothing. No clothes, no toothbrush, nothing' What would you grab in 15 minutes? Twenty-two households stay put despite dam threat Ms Swann said the emergency operation was ""ahead of schedule"" and she was hopeful engineers would be able to assess the dam integrity later so they could potentially begin making plans to allow residents back home. Army troops have also been drafted in to help with the operation to shore up the dam wall The situation at Whaley Bridge has continued to disrupt train services, with East Midlands Trainsreporting delays,externalon a number of routes. TransPennine Express services have alsobeen affected,external. How well was the dam maintained? Whaley Bridge dam emergency in pictures The Canal and River Trust said it was monitoring water levels in the nearby River Goyt, where the water removed from the Toddbrook Reservoir is being taken. Richard Coakley, a former president of the Institution of Civil Engineers, told the BBC it would take years to get the dam back into full operation. He said: ""It's a long haul actually back for a proper dam to provide water supply to the canal system. ""There'll be lots of investigation taking place about how it failed and the reasons for that, and eventually they'll have to take out everything that [the] Chinook has put into that hole and start to reconstruct the spillway in accordance with modern systems and modern techniques to actually make it safe.""

"Matt Hancock says he has changed his mind because ""the facts have changed"" Parliament can no longer block a no-deal Brexit, the health secretary has said. During his bid for the Tory leadership, Matt Hancocksaid no deal was ""not an available choice"",externalto the next PM, as MPs ""will never allow it to happen"". He told the BBC he had now changed his mind because they had a chance to block it in a series of votes last month, but failed to muster the numbers. Jeremy Corbyn said Labour would do all it could to stop no deal. But Downing Street insisted the UK would be leaving on 31 October ""whatever the circumstances"", whether a deal had been agreed with the EU or not. ""Politicians cannot choose which votes to respect. They promised to respect the referendum result and we must do,"" No 10 said. Asked whether Mr Johnson would respect the outcome of votes in Parliament - including a vote of no confidence in his government - the spokesman refused to be drawn, calling it a ""hypothetical"" question. MPs have repeatedly rejected the agreement Theresa May reached with Brussels, but have so far failed to coalesce around an alternative. In a no-deal scenario, the UK would immediately leave the EU with no agreement about the ""divorce"" process, overnight exiting the single market and customs union - arrangements designed to help facilitate trade. Opponents say it would damage the economy and lead to border posts between Northern Ireland and the Republic - but other politicians argue any disruption could be quickly overcome. No-deal Brexit: What you need to know Extra Â£2.1bn for no-deal Brexit planning 10 ways a no-deal Brexit could affect you On 12 June, the Commons rejected a motion tabled by Jeremy Corbyn, which would have allowed MPs to take control of the parliamentary timetable in the autumn to stop no deal going through. Mr Hancock told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was that vote which prompted him to change his mind. ""I thought that would go through and in fact, the government won by 11,"" he said. ""I now don't think it can (stop no-deal). I thought that it could and the votes went differently to what I anticipated. When the facts change, sometimes even as a politician you have to change your mind."" Mr Hancock's comments echo a warning reportedly made by the prime minister's senior adviser, Dominic Cummings, that MPs have left it too late to stop no deal. But Dominic Grieve, one of the most prominent pro-European Conservative MPs,told the BBC Mr Cummings was a ""master of misinformation"", and there were a number of options still left for MPs wanting to block no deal. They include bringing down the government, via a vote of no confidence, and setting up a new government in its place, he said. If Mr Johnson loses a vote of no confidence and it becomes clear that another potential prime minister could command the confidence of the Commons, the convention is that he would be obliged to resign. However, Catherine Haddon, from the Institute for Government think tank, said this was ""untested territory"", adding: ""He could say: 'No, I'm staying as prime minister and we're having a general election.'"" The date of an election is set by royal proclamation on the advice of the prime minister, so he could choose a date after 31 October and press on with Brexit in the meantime. Speaking on a visit to Whaley Bridge to seeefforts being made to shore up a damaged dam,Mr Corbyn said Labour would ""do everything to stop no deal, including a no confidence vote at the appropriate, very early, time to do it"". He said Mr Johnson appeared to be ""trying to slip no deal through, slip past Parliament and slip past the British people"", and that was ""not acceptable"".

"This video can not be played Conjoined twins Marieme and Ndeye continue to surprise doctors Marieme and Ndeye, conjoined twins from Senegal, are preparing to start full-time nursery in their new home of Cardiff. Originally not expected to live for more than a few days, they were brought by their father to the UK in the hope of getting a better life. Now aged three, the girls are continuing to surprise doctors with their progress. But they have discovered the girls' circulatory systems are far more closely linked than previously thought - so it is now impossible to separate them. This also explains why they have continued to thrive for so long. Meet Marieme and Ndeye The battle to separate Safa and Marwa ""Doctors now know that they are a very unique and complex case,"" their father Ibrahima Ndiaye said. ""They are very linked internally and this explains why they have exceeded all expectations. ""They are working together to keep themselves and each other alive and the situation is a little more optimistic."" The new discovery has changed things for the girls. Ibrahima laughing with his children at their Cardiff playgroup Back in January, surgeons at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London were considering attempting separation, something which Ibrahima did not want due to the risks involved. But the new findings show that neither twin could survive without the other and that separation is now impossible. The girls have separate hearts and spines, but share a common liver, bladder and digestive system. Gillian Body, consultant paediatrician at Noah's Ark Children's Hospital for Wales, said: ""The girls are doing very well. ""They are enjoying a period of stability and constantly surprising us with their progress. ""Last year we thought Marieme was very much dependent on Ndeye, but recent CT scans show they are both dependent on each other for staying alive. ""Long term this means they cannot be separated but in many ways it is nice that they are both dependent on each other. ""This is a big turn-around. Previously the ethics were about could we and should we separate them but now we know this decision is no longer on the table. ""They are now looking forward to school placements and I hope they can enjoy being children."" The girls were not expected to live longer than a few days Although the girls' health is still changeable and their condition described as ""life-limiting"", this period of stability is enabling Ibrahima to focus on their future. ""My girls continue to grow and bring me so much joy,"" he said. ""Their speaking is coming along, and they can move with greater independence. ""When Ndeye sees me doing the dishes, she says 'poor daddy', which makes me laugh so hard. ""And when Ndeye is crying, Marieme will turn to her and say, 'Shhh, noisy'."" The twins who are turning a profit My inspirational twin with Down's Syndrome I juggle two sets of twins with work Currently the girls attend a playgroup for a few hours a week, but from September, they will attend nursery five mornings a week. Ibrahima said: ""It's another chapter opening and bringing hope. ""It doesn't let you forget the situation, but I have learnt that when it is time to celebrate, you should celebrate and see a bright future. ""I can imagine it may be an emotional day for me, seeing them in a uniform as so many times I have thought this day might not come. ""I want people to know about this success as, although we are a private family, so many people ask about them and have taken the girls to their hearts."" Ibrahima and his girls in early 2019 - when doctors were considering separation As well as looking after the girls, Ibrahima is hoping to set up a charity to help other children with disabilities. He said: ""With this situation and all we have been through, I can't close my eyes to other children with disabilities and complex needs. ""So I am setting up a foundation for the girls, in conjunction with Ty Hafan children's hospice, called Conjoined Destiny. ""If the situation gets worse and they don't make it, I want to put something in place for them to leave a footprint to the world despite our humble and difficult beginning. ""And if they grow to see it, they will know how useful their lives have been."" The Conjoined Twins: An Impossible Decision is on BBC Two at 21:00 BST on Mondayand on the BBC iPlayer.

"8chan will likely be targeted by cyberattacks seeking to knock it offline The far-right web forum 8chan, used to celebrate mass shootings and spread suspects' so-called âmanifestosâ, has been forced offline after losing its cyber-security protection. Cloudflare, a San Francisco-based firm that provides added security for websites to prevent cyber-attacks, said it would stop protecting 8chan at midnight Pacific Time (08:00 BST) on Monday. The 21-year-old suspect in this weekendâs shooting in El Paso, Texas, is understood to have used 8chan to spread his manifesto. Previously, the site was also used by the suspect in Marchâs shooting in Christchurch, New Zealand, as well as the suspect in April's synagogue shooting in Poway, California. Losing Cloudflareâs protection has made 8chan vulnerable to a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack, whereby a website is bombarded with traffic that overwhelms its servers, rendering it inaccessible. A few minutes after the Cloudflare service was withdrawn, 8chan did indeed become unavailable. What is 8chan? However, 8chan's site administrator says it was moving to another security firm, BitMitigate, based in the US state of Washington. BitMitigate's website says it has ""a proven commitment to liberty"". BitMitigate stepped in to help neo-Nazi site the Daily Stormer when it lost Cloudflare protection in 2017. The BBC has approached BitMitigate for comment. But at this time 8Chan remains offline. Cloudflare chief executive Matthew Prince had said, in the wake of Saturdayâs shootings, that his firm would continue to support 8chan as its policy was to remain neutral over the type of content the service protected. However, on Sunday evening Mr Prince wrote in a blog post,externalthat ""8chan has repeatedly proven itself to be a cesspool of hateâ. âThey have proven themselves to be lawless and that lawlessness has caused multiple tragic deaths,â Mr Prince wrote. ""Even if 8chan may not have violated the letter of the law in refusing to moderate their hate-filled community, they have created an environment that revels in violating its spirit.â Mr Prince warned that while 8chan would be disrupted by Cloudflareâs decision, it would likely be able to rebuild itself - as was the case when Cloudflare stopped providing protection for the Daily Stormer, a neo-Nazi site, in 2017. âThey quickly came back online using a Cloudflare competitor,â Mr Prince wrote. ""That competitor at the time promoted as a feature the fact that they didn't respond to legal process. He added: ""I have little doubt we'll see the same happen with 8chan. While removing 8chan from our network takes heat off of us, it does nothing to address why hateful sites fester online. It does nothing to address why mass shootings occur.

"Boris Johnson has given the green light to 20 new building and infrastructure projects in the NHS in England. The Â£850m package will pay for new wards, intensive care units and diagnostic centres as well as refurbishing some existing facilities over the next five years. Mr Johnson also said there would be an extra Â£1bn this year to improve and maintain existing buildings. But doubts have been raised over whether the money really is new. Mr Johnson said the Â£1bn for this year was extra - and would mean ""more beds, new wards, and extra life-saving equipment"". It will bring spending to Â£7bn during 2019-20. Is NHS buildings boost all it seems? When asked about staffing and recruitment problems faced by hospitals, Mr Johnson said the Â£1.8bn was ""on top of the Â£34bn that we're putting into the NHS"". ""But of course the lion's share of that will go on staffing, attracting, retaining, professionally developing the staff in the NHS,"" he said. He previously said he was ""determined to deliver"" on the promises of the 2016 EU referendum, after criticism of the Vote Leave campaign's claim that Â£350m a week was being sent to the EU and could be spent on the NHS instead. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the NHS was ""priority number one"" for the new prime minister. He said money for hospital upgrades was possible because the economy was growing and the funds would be available this year. Analysis by Nick Triggle, health correspondent The government has always promised it would be increasing capital funding in 2019-20. Last year's Budget said spending would rise from Â£5.9bn in 2018-19 to Â£6.7bn in the new financial year. But that was subsequently reduced. By the time Boris Johnson became prime minister, the plan was to spend Â£5.9bn again. After Monday's announcement that now increases to Â£7bn. So is the money new? Well certainly Â£300m of it is - and if you are being generous you could argue Â£1bn of it is from the situation when Mr Johnson took office. But even if we accept that it is all new money it is not a given that it will all end up improving the infrastructure of the health service. During the past five years, about Â£5bn less has been spent on capital than had been planned for. This is because significant sums - about a sixth of the capital budget - have been transferred into the day-to-day running pot to help balance the books. The truth is it will be at the end of the financial year only that we will be able to see whether this promised money has gone where it should - and even if it does, it could be argued it is just reversing the cuts seen in the past few years. Read more from Nick here Responding to the funding announcement, the Health Foundation said ""years of under-investment in the NHS's infrastructure means this extra money risks being little more than a drop in the ocean"". Ben Gershlick, from the charity, added that NHS facilities in England were ""in major disrepair"", with a Â£6bn maintenance backlog. Labour's shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said there was ""huge scepticism"" about whether the funding was new. Meanwhile, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the announcement today on funding for the NHS ""goes nowhere near paying for all the cuts over the past nine years"". Mr Corbyn said ""many hospitals had been left off"" and ""we need something a bit more comprehensive"". But the head of NHS England, Simon Stevens, said the money was a ""significant start"" to ""much needed capital investment"". ""The concrete steps being set out this week will mean investment flows directly to front-line services, providing new clinics and wards,"" he added. The prime minister announced the funding package on a visit to Pilgrim Hospital in Boston, Lincolnshire, which is receiving a Â£21.3m share of the money to improve its A&E department. Andrew Morgan, chief executive of United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust, which runs the hospital, told Radio 4's WATO programme that it was ""a small step, but a very positive one"". ""We have a huge backlog maintenance bill here,"" he said. Mr Morgan explained that staffing was still his top priority. But some hospitals, such as Liverpool Women's Hospital, missed out on funding. Its interim medical director Andrew Loughney said they needed Â£100m to rebuild the hospital, which he called ""a clinical priority"". ""Perhaps if we were in a marginal constituency, we would have been allocated the money,"" he said. The government said other parts of the UK would benefit too. Health is devolved, so Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland make decisions about spending on the NHS. But under funding rules there would be money made available to them, ministers said. Later this week, the government is also expected to announce changes to the NHS pension scheme after senior doctors said new rules meant they could not afford to work extra shifts to tackle waiting lists. One hospital said the rule change, which means ""punitive"" taxes for doctors who take additional shifts and exceed the limit for pensions contributions, wasthe equivalent of losing 60 consultants. Mr Johnson has previously pledged to resolve the problem. â¢Luton & Dunstable University Hospital- Â£99.5m for a new block in Luton to provide critical and intensive care, as well as a delivery suite and operating theatres â¢Norfolk & Norwich University Hospitals- Â£69.7m to provide diagnostic and assessment centres in Norwich, Great Yarmouth and King's Lynn for cancer and non-cancerous disease â¢Norfolk and Suffolk- Â£40m to build four new hospital wards in Norwich, providing 80 beds â¢South Norfolk Clinical Commissioning Group- Â£25.2m to develop and improve primary care services in South Norfolk. â¢University Hospitals Birmingham- Â£97.1m to provide a new purpose-built hospital facility replacing outdated outpatient, treatment and diagnostic accommodation â¢United Lincolnshire Hospitals- Â£21.3m to develop urgent and emergency care zones in A&E â¢Wye Valley- Â£23.6m to provide new hospital wards in Hereford, providing 72 beds â¢University Hospitals of North Midlands- Â£17.6m to three new modern wards to improve capacity in Stoke, delivering approximately 84 beds for this winter â¢Barking, Havering and Redbridge CCGs and North East London- Â£17m to develop a new health and wellbeing hub in north east London â¢Croydon Health Services- Â£12.7m to extend and refurbish critical care units at the Croydon University Hospital â¢South Yorkshire and Bassetlaw Integrated Care System- Â£57.5m for primary care investment across South Yorkshire and Bassetlaw â¢The Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals- Â£41.7m to improve paediatric cardiac services in the north east â¢Leeds Teaching Hospitals- Â£12m to provide a single laboratory information management system across West Yorkshire and Harrogate, covering all pathology disciplines â¢Greater Manchester Mental Health- Â£72.3m to build a new adult mental health inpatient unit in Manchester â¢Mersey Care- Â£33m to provide a new 40-bed low secure unit for people with learning disabilities â¢Stockport- Â£30.6m to provide a new emergency care campus development at Stepping Hill Hospital in Stockport, incorporating an urgent treatment centre, GP assessment unit and planned investigation unit â¢Wirral Clinical Commissioning Group- Â£18m to improve patient flow by improving access via the urgent treatment centre â¢Tameside and Glossop Integrated Care- Â£16.3m to provide emergency and urgent care facilities at Tameside General Hospital in Ashton-under-Lyne â¢Isle of Wight- Â£48m to redesign acute services for Isle of Wight residents â¢Royal Cornwall Hospitals- Â£99.9m to build a new women and children's hospital in Truro PM pledges Â£1.8bn for hospital upgrades Do Boris Johnson's tax and spending plans add up?

"This video can not be played 'My heart hurts on every level' The US border city of El Paso is in shock after a gunman apparently drove hundreds of miles to commit an atrocity there. ""I've never been scared of being Hispanic ever before, but now I am,"" says Ivonne Diaz, 31, bursting into tears. ""I can't believe this has happened. El Paso is a city of immigrants and we have always fought for each other."" At 10:30 on a Saturday in August, there is no more ordinary activity than heading to the supermarket. Thousands of people were at the Walmart in El Paso that day. The car park at the border town was full of cars bearing US and Mexican number plates, their drivers and passengers picking up back-to-school supplies or just some bread and milk. Maybe a few beers for the weekend. And then gunshots rang out, killing 20 people. Two more have since died from their injuries. The shockwaves have been reverberating all weekend. â¢Young couple 'gave lives to protect baby son' US stunned by two mass shootings in 24 hours Will anything change this time? ""I'm just worried for the list of names to come out,"" says taxi driver Carla Karam. ""Everyone will have known someone. We all know each other - it's a city of six degrees of separation."" What strikes you here is the friendliness. Strangers are welcomed with open arms - literally in some cases, with hugs being given to journalists along with bottles of water. Memorials have sprung up around the Walmart Cynthia Chavez, 41, says: ""I'm so sad and don't know how we're meant to explain this to our kids. In El Paso, we're the type of people who, if you come to town, we will welcome you with open doors and make you feel part of this town."" Danielle Novoa, 30, who was with her husband, her twin sister and 10-month-old son, says they were heading to the store and were half an hour away when they heard what had happened. ""We knew right away it wouldn't be someone local. There's no way any citizen could live or think that way. ""Being Latina, in a huge Hispanic community, there were times I would think: 'Hey, we could be a target because of how things are now in other states.' But then I never really thought it would happen to us. ""We feel so safe walking out the door in El Paso. But now, we'll be thinking: 'Am I OK to go out and get a gallon of milk? Some diapers for the baby?'"" The Novoa family hold a sign commemorating the victims of the attack Julio Novoa, her husband, says: ""We've always been proud of the fact we accept the diversity of being Mexican-Americans and US citizens. And we all get on so well. ""We were targeted because we're the best of what unity and diversity means. They know we are representative of how America really can be. And because of that, it doesn't surprise me that a white supremacist would want to target us."" Others visit the makeshift memorial behind the Walmart store with their own tributes. There are flowers, teddy bears, and signs proclaiming ""El Paso Strong"". There are tears, too, for those who died and for the shattered innocence of the community. Deena Delgado, 26, who is there with her 10-month-old daughter Aerie, is weeping as she tells how her brother and niece were in Walmart at the time of the shooting. They were contemplating looking for one more item to buy when shots were fired. She fears her niece, seven, will be left traumatised. Everyone speaks of the need for the city to come together. They say they will unite and come back stronger than before. And one of the major talking points is the issue of gun control. Jose Rijos, who has lived in the city for more than 30 years, says: ""As long as we have hatred and we have a way to release that anger through guns, we're not going to have the answer. But we have the combination right now to cause this - we have the hatred and we have guns. And this is the result."" Signs and flowers were left at a roadside near the site of the shooting But Willa Melendez says: ""I know there's going to be a lot of people doing applications for carrying guns after this. I think that's the reality. It shouldn't be that way, but it's got to that."" She says her sister had just left Walmart when the shooting happened. ""We were on the freeway when I found out. I called everybody to check up on them, everybody,"" she says. ""My 26-year-old grandson got stuck at the mall, where he was working. He's not doing so well. He didn't sleep last night. We're so near the border here - we don't consider it two different countries. ""So this hurts. It hurts."" People take part in a rally against hate a day after the shooting Jonas Porras, 19, speaks of the suspected gunman, who is just a few years older than him. ""The thought of coming here, of all places, coming here and disturbing the peaceâ¦ Why not leave alone what's not to be broken? But I think this makes us stronger. It makes us who we are. We're going to pull through."" He had been on his way to Walmart when the cars in front of him started turning around, so he followed suit. ""I feel very blessed at the moment,"" he adds. America's gun culture in 10 charts Four dates that explain the US gun debate As night fell, vigils were held in the city. Thousands turned out at the events to remember those who died and to join together as one community. This video can not be played A soldier and a baseball coach recall how they tried to save children from the El Paso shooting In Ponder Park, a short distance from Walmart, hundreds upon hundreds filled the Little League field. There was a multi-faith procession before people's voices joined together in song, holding phone torches aloft. One of the biggest cheers was for three Walmart employees hailed as the heroes of the community for saving countless lives. They wept on stage as their bravery was applauded. And Democratic presidential candidate and El Paso native Beto O'Rourke was among the speakers at a rally at the city's Las Americas headquarters, following a silent walk of remembrance. He was cheered as he called for an end to gun violence, alongside the parents of Joaquin Oliver, who died in the Parkland shooting in 2018. Today would have been Joaquin's birthday. Vigils were held in El Paso over the weekend As Happy Birthday was sung, people were in tears, the joint tragedies bringing them together. Butterflies were released, flying between and fluttering around people's heads. It was a reminder of the grim list of names this city joins. People held their banners again as they left the rally. One of them read: ""Shaken, not broken."" El Paso is not the kind of place where this happens. That's what its residents repeat, over and over again. The queues to give blood to the injured, with people happily waiting for hours? That's El Paso. Coming out in their thousands at a candlelit vigil to sing Amazing Grace? That's El Paso. A community coming together in one of its darkest moments to vow this can never happen again? That's El Paso.

"Brighton Pride has apologised after some disabled people were unable to watch Kylie Minogue's performance. It said its accessibility platform was at ""full capacity"" by the time its main act took to the stage on Saturday. Jenny Skelton says her 22-year-old daughter Charlie - who has severe learning disabilities - was ""crying inconsolably"" when they were told to stay in a tent without a view of Kylie during her performance. She says up to 20 people were involved. Brighton Pride said the platform had a fixed capacity and access was on a ""first come, first serve basis"". ""We had the correct wristbands and then we were told no,"" Jenny tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. ""My issue is just simply that they didn't have sufficient space for disabled people and that's wrong."" Charlie Skelton missed most of Kylie's performance after waiting for ""months and months"" to see her Jenny says that most of the people kept in the tent left Pride before the end of Kylie's performance because their only option was to remain where they were or join the crowd, where they didn't feel safe. But eventually - and after requests from those who remained - security staff were allowed to let disabled guests and their friends and family take empty spaces on a VIP viewing platform. ""Charlie was crying inconsolably for much of it,"" says Jenny, ""but then when we went onto the VIP area, in the end she loved it. ""She was dancing and she had an absolutely fantastic time, it's just such a shame it was spoiled by waiting for an hour and a half trying to explain to her why she wouldn't be able to see Kylie."" Jenny says she had only had positive experiences at Brighton Pride, partly because of the involvement of Brighton and Hove community safety forum, who had in previous years helped with disabled access. Jenny also shared a video of her experience on Twitter. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""My grandma was recently given a terminal diagnosis with cancer and on her bucket list was to come to her first ever Pride. It really meant a lot to us,"" Liam tells Newsbeat.

Brighton Pride said 275 people applied and used its range of access services at Preston Park - where the event was held. It denies claims that any people were prevented from leaving the access tent. Becky Stevens, head of operations said: ""Our aim is that all Pride-goers are able to enjoy what Brighton Pride has to offer. We work hard with our provider Tiger Tea to create safe, accessible spaces throughout the festival. ""Over 100 people with accessibility requirements enjoyed the main stage shows on the accessible viewing platform, on a first-come, first-serve basis. ""We encouraged people with accessibility requirements to contact us after purchasing tickets, so that we could help to make their day as inclusive and enjoyable as possible. ""We are sorry if some Pride-goers were unable to be accommodated at the viewing platform later on Saturday night."" But Liam wants a refund for the cost of tickets for himself, his mum and his gran. ""I think the statement Pride put out was absolutely ridiculous and I haven't seen any ownership,"" he says. ""I think Pride have made a lot of errors in this.""

"India has deployed tens of thousands of troops to Indian-administered Kashmir in recent days India's government has revoked part of the constitution that gives Indian-administered Kashmir special status, prompting fears of unrest. Article 370 is sensitive because it guarantees significant autonomy for the Muslim-majority state. The measure was accompanied by a telecoms and media blackout which began on Sunday evening. There is a long-running insurgency on the Indian side. India and Pakistan fought several conflicts over Kashmir. For many Kashmiris, Article 370 was the main justification for being a part of India and by revoking it, the BJP has irrevocably changed Delhi's relationship with the region, the BBC's Geeta Pandey reports from Delhi. Meanwhile India's parliament is expected to pass a bill splitting Indian-administered Kashmir into two territories governed directly by Delhi. Pakistan condemned India's decision to revoke the special status of its part of Kashmir as illegal, saying it would ""exercise all possible options"" to counter it. ""India is playing a dangerous game which will have serious consequences for regional peace and stability,"" said Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi. Why India and Pakistan dispute Kashmir Why a special law on Kashmir is controversial Modi's Kashmir move will fuel resentment 'India has betrayed Kashmir' But an Indian government source said there was no external implication as the Line of Control, the de facto border, and boundaries of Kashmir had not been altered. During the partition of the Indian subcontinent in 1947, some expected Jammu and Kashmir, like other Muslim-majority regions, to go to Pakistan. But the ruler of the princely state, who had initially wanted Jammu and Kashmir to become independent, joined India in return for help against an invasion of tribesmen from Pakistan. War broke out between India and Pakistan, and Kashmir effectively became partitioned. The region, which remains one of the most militarised zones in the world, has been a flashpoint between India and Pakistan for more than six decades. By Aamir Peerzada, BBC News, Srinagar By the time we woke up this morning, the internet was gone and we now have no mobile connectivity. If people step out of their homes, they see paramilitary forces on every street. Almost every major road is shut - we are hearing that more troops are being deployed. No-one knows what is happening in other parts of the state - we can't talk to anyone else. People are concerned - they don't know what is happening, they don't know what is going to happen. It's an atmosphere of fear. People are scared to come out, they have stockpiled food for months. Kashmiris have always been willing to defend the state's special status. It looks like a long road ahead, and no-one knows what's next. In 1949, a special provision was added to India's constitution providing autonomy to Jammu and Kashmir. Article 370 allows the state to have its own constitution, a separate flag and independence over all matters except foreign affairs, defence and communications. Another provision later added under Article 370 - 35A - gives special privileges to permanent residents, including state government jobs and the exclusive right to own property in the state. It is seen as protecting the state's distinct demographic character as the only Muslim-majority state in India. The move by the Hindu nationalist BJP government prompted outrage in parliament, and some legal experts have called it an attack on the constitution. Critics fear the move is designed to change the demographic make-up of India-administered Kashmir - by giving people from the rest of the country to right to acquire property and settle there permanently. The state'sformer chief minister, Mehbooba Mufti, told the BBC she felt there was a ""sinister design"" to the decision. ""They just want to occupy our land and want to make this Muslim-majority state like any other state and reduce us to a minority and disempower us totally."" The ruling BJP made revoking Article 370 part of the party's 2019 election manifesto - and it won a landslide victory earlier this year. It has argued that Article 370 has prevented the region's development and its integration with India. Supporters of India's ruling BJP have been celebrating the move An Indian government source told journalists the region's special status had discouraged outside investment and affected its economy, while terrorism and smuggling were rife. ""A set of anachronistic provisions were not allowing the progress of Kashmir,"" the source said. ""The huge sum of money and resources which were going into the state were not being optimised."" India's government announced a presidential order revoking all of Article 370 apart from one clause which says that the state is an integral part of India. The order was met by massive protests from the opposition - but has now been signed into law by President Ram Nath Kovind. Prior to the announcement, a telecoms and media blackout began on Sunday evening in the region. The government explained the move as being aimed at pre-empting any violence that the announcement might trigger. Officials said the restrictions would not be in place for long. Opponents of the move have also been out in the streets of Delhi Parliament is also expected to approve a measure dividing the state into two regions ruled by the central government. One region will combine Muslim-majority Kashmir and Hindu-majority Jammu. The other is Buddhist-majority Ladakh, which is culturally and historically close to Tibet. The forgotten victims of the world's highest war The funerals driving youth to militancy Indian-administered Kashmir is in a state of lockdown. Curfew-like conditions have been imposed, and orders preventing the assembly of more than four people have been introduced. Tens of thousands of Indian troops were deployed to the region ahead of Monday's announcement and tourists were told to leave under warnings of a terror threat. This video can not be played In December Yogita Limaye examined why there had been a rise in violence in Kashmir In the hours before Monday's announcement, two of the state's former chief ministers - Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti - were placed under house arrest.

"8chan will likely be targeted by cyberattacks seeking to knock it offline The far-right web forum 8chan, used to celebrate mass shootings and spread suspects' so-called âmanifestosâ, has been forced offline after losing its cyber-security protection. Cloudflare, a San Francisco-based firm that provides added security for websites to prevent cyber-attacks, said it would stop protecting 8chan at midnight Pacific Time (08:00 BST) on Monday. The 21-year-old suspect in this weekendâs shooting in El Paso, Texas, is understood to have used 8chan to spread his manifesto. Previously, the site was also used by the suspect in Marchâs shooting in Christchurch, New Zealand, as well as the suspect in April's synagogue shooting in Poway, California. Losing Cloudflareâs protection has made 8chan vulnerable to a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack, whereby a website is bombarded with traffic that overwhelms its servers, rendering it inaccessible. A few minutes after the Cloudflare service was withdrawn, 8chan did indeed become unavailable. What is 8chan? However, 8chan's site administrator says it was moving to another security firm, BitMitigate, based in the US state of Washington. BitMitigate's website says it has ""a proven commitment to liberty"". BitMitigate stepped in to help neo-Nazi site the Daily Stormer when it lost Cloudflare protection in 2017. The BBC has approached BitMitigate for comment. But at this time 8Chan remains offline. Cloudflare chief executive Matthew Prince had said, in the wake of Saturdayâs shootings, that his firm would continue to support 8chan as its policy was to remain neutral over the type of content the service protected. However, on Sunday evening Mr Prince wrote in a blog post,externalthat ""8chan has repeatedly proven itself to be a cesspool of hateâ. âThey have proven themselves to be lawless and that lawlessness has caused multiple tragic deaths,â Mr Prince wrote. ""Even if 8chan may not have violated the letter of the law in refusing to moderate their hate-filled community, they have created an environment that revels in violating its spirit.â Mr Prince warned that while 8chan would be disrupted by Cloudflareâs decision, it would likely be able to rebuild itself - as was the case when Cloudflare stopped providing protection for the Daily Stormer, a neo-Nazi site, in 2017. âThey quickly came back online using a Cloudflare competitor,â Mr Prince wrote. ""That competitor at the time promoted as a feature the fact that they didn't respond to legal process. He added: ""I have little doubt we'll see the same happen with 8chan. While removing 8chan from our network takes heat off of us, it does nothing to address why hateful sites fester online. It does nothing to address why mass shootings occur. It does nothing to address why portions of the population feel so disenchanted they turn to hate. ""In taking this action we've solved our own problem, but we haven't solved the internetâs.â The two companies protect websites from attacks, as well as making websites load more quickly for legitimate users. They can be thought of as a kind of bouncer or security guard for websites that get a large amount of traffic, or may be a likely target of cyber-attacks. They use technology that can verify where internet traffic is coming from and what it is trying to do. They can distinguish whether the visitor is a genuine person, a network of automated bots that is being used to flood a website or requests that keep servers too busy to handle normal uses. They are meant to block any attempts from ""bad"" traffic getting through. Cloudflare provides protection for more than 12 million websites, and is expected to float on the stock market later this year. Chief executive Matthew Prince has expressed concernat the power his company has to decide whether or not a website is able to exist on the open internet. 8chan is a forum created in 2013 by Fredrick Brennan as an alternative to 4chan, a message board popular with gamers. 8chan promised less moderation of controversial topics and images that were being removed from 4chan. As such, 8chan has hosted far-right extremist views and imagery. Mr Brennan gave up ownership of 8chan in 2015 and has since called for it to be shut down. Following Cloudflareâs announcement, he wrote on Twitter: ""Thank you so much@CloudFlare,externalFinally this nightmare might have an end.â 8chan is now owned and run by Jim Watkins, a former US army veteran, believed to be living in the Philippines.

"John Flint is giving up the role he held for 18 months ""by mutual agreement with the board"" The chief executive of HSBC has stepped down after the bank said it needed a change in leadership to address a ""challenging global environment"". John Flint is giving up the role he has held for a year-and-a-half ""by mutual agreement with the board"". He will immediately cease his day-to-day responsibilities at HSBC, but will help with the transition as Noel Quinn takes over as interim chief executive. Chairman Mark Tucker thanked Mr Flint for his ""commitment"" and ""dedication"". However, he said: ""In the increasingly complex and challenging global environment in which the bank operates, the board believes a change is needed to meet the challenges that we face and to capture the very significant opportunities before us."" HSBC profits hit by China slowdown HSBC sparks controversy with new ad campaign HSBC made the surprise announcement as it reported a 15.8% rise in pre-tax profit to $12.4bn (Â£10.2bn) for the six months to 30 June. Mr Flint, who has worked at HSBC for 30 years, said: ""I have agreed with the board that today's good interim results indicate that this is the right time for change, both for me and the bank."" The 51-year-old ran the bank's retail and wealth management business before taking over as chief executive last year. At that time, Mr Flint was seen as a safe choice for the top job. HSBC portrays itself as a conservative bank.  Unlike some rivals, it has never pursued the wilder excesses of investment banking, and has a proud record of appointing its chief executive and chairman from within. It is part of the establishment in Asia and the West, and makes its money from the giant trade flows between. With a 30-year track record at the bank, John Flint appeared the safest of hands when appointed 18 months ago. The bank's shares have fallen during his tenure, but the increasing trade tensions between America and China explain most of the fall. Mr Flint will be a ""good leaver"" - meaning he keeps his entitlement to most of his share options - and which rules out any idea his departure is linked to misconduct. Mr Flint was regarded as the favourite of his predecessor as chief executive, Stuart Gulliver - so it is possible that Mark Tucker, HSBC's chairman, has simply decided he wants his own man in the job. But the Huawei connection, although not confirmed by HSBC, cannot be discounted. In seeking to keep in the good books of the US authorities - which had a monitor embedded at the bank - HSBC provided the information that allowed America to apply for the extradition of Meng Wanzhou, Huawei's chief financial officer. That cannot have pleased Beijing, and HSBC is reliant on China's goodwill as much as America's. Mr Flint may have been the necessary sacrifice. Commenting on the current environment, HSBC said ""the outlook has changed"". It said that US interest rates were now expected to fall rather than rise and ""geopolitical issues could impact a significant number of our major markets"". It added: ""In the near term, the nature and impact of the UK's departure from the European Union remain highly uncertain."" Mr Flint has a 12-month notice period, but it is not clear when his departure date will be, because he has ""agreed to remain available to HSBC"". HSBC has also granted Mr Flint ""good leaver"" status, which means he will be entitled to any stock options that vest after he exits the bank, provided he does not work at a competitor for two years. The bank said it has begun a search to find a new chief executive and ""will be considering internal and external candidates"".

"Accountancy firm BDO has been appointed administrators to Harland and Wolff, a spokesman for the Belfast shipyard has said. An insolvency request is expected to be filed at the High Court in Belfast on Tuesday. The move puts 120 jobs at risk and could spell the end of the iconic firm, best known for building the Titanic. Union sources said staff were given redundancy notices saying the business will cease trading on Monday evening. This video can not be played The history of the Belfast shipyard A week ago, workers said they had taken control of the site and established a rota to ensure their protest continued around the clock. After the administrators were appointed on Monday, workers said their protest would continue. At a press conference, trade unionists representing staff warned they will stand against the DUP in a forthcoming general election if the party does not do more to support workers. Unions representing H&W workers held a press conference on Monday Harland and Wolff's best known vessel is the Titanic, which was built at the yard between 1909 and 1911. At its height, Harland and Wolff employed more than 30,000 people. The firm had been up for sale amid serious financial problems at its Norwegian owner. Shipyard crisis 'a commercial issue' Council calls for support for Harland and Wolff Unions representing workers have called for the shipyard to be nationalised, arguing that it would be cheaper for the government to keep the shipyard open. However, the government has said the crisis is ""ultimately a commercial issue"". East Belfast MP Gavin Robinson, from the DUP, said officials had advised against government intervention. ""We've pulled all the political levers that we can,"" he told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme. DUP MP Gavin Robinson said government intervention would conflict with state aid rules The MP said Harland and Wolff had asked the government for shortfall funding of Â£650,000, which would have given the company ""breathing space"" for the month of August ""so that they could explore other options"". But he added: ""The official advice is that it cannot be done for three reasons: there is no order book at present so the money would be going in with no generation of product or profit; and there was no ability to secure the loans or pay them back; and it would also conflict with state aid rules."" Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said Labour would have nationalised the shipyard and he accused the government of betraying the workers. John McDonnell said Harland and Wolff could win future Navy contracts Mr McDonnell, who visited Harland and Wolff staff in Belfast on Monday, said the shipyard has the potential for future work. He said he saw no reason why naval ships could not be built in Belfast in the future, in order to maintain the skills and capacity at Harland and Wolff. The Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU) said the shipyard ""should be returned to the people"". ""The entire trade union movement across these islands stands as one with the workers at the shipyard,"" said ICTU assistant general secretary, Owen Reidy. The HMS Eagle was launched by Princess Elizabeth in March 1946 The shipyard was founded in 1861 by Yorkshireman Edward Harland and a German, Gustav Wolff. By the early 20th Century, it was the world's most prolific builder of ocean liners. It was one of Northern Ireland's key industrial assets during World War Two, producing 140 warships, 123 merchant ships and more than 500 tanks. Its workforce reached a peak in the post-war years when it employed about 35,000 people. By the late 1950s, the yard was facing increased global competition and the impact of the rise of air travel. The Canberra was built for P&O to sail between London and Sydney The launch of the Canberra in 1960 marked the last cruise liner to be built in Belfast. By the mid-1960s the business was in serious decline. At one stage in 1966, the management went to the old Stormont government and pleaded for a subsidy because it did not have enough money to cover the next pay day. That was the start of more than 30 years of subsidies, during which about Â£1bn of taxpayers' money was pumped into Harland and Wolff to keep it afloat. The firm was nationalised in 1975 with the Northern Ireland Office minister, Stan Orme, describing the business as having ""a sorry financial record"". Much of the shipyard's work in recent years has been in the construction of offshore wind turbines By that stage it was still employing about 10,000 people. It returned to private ownership in 1989 through a management-employee buyout, backed by the Norwegian industrialist Fred Olsen. It increasingly focused on the oil and gas sectors, but struggled to compete against major shipbuilders in east Asia. The Anvil Point beneath the Harland and Wolff cranes after it was built in 2003 The yard built its last ship in 2003 - a Ministry of Defence ferry called the Anvil Point. Since then, it has worked on other areas of marine engineering such as oil rig refurbishment and offshore wind turbines. The administrators will try to restart a sales process. There is likely to be some interest. The Newry firm, MJM, that specialises in ship fitout, is a potential bidder. At least one property company is also interested in the business. But the future is not bright for the workforce, even if the business is sold to a new industrial operator. The history of the Belfast shipyard.

"8chan will likely be targeted by cyberattacks seeking to knock it offline The far-right web forum 8chan, used to celebrate mass shootings and spread suspects' so-called âmanifestosâ, has been forced offline after losing its cyber-security protection. Cloudflare, a San Francisco-based firm that provides added security for websites to prevent cyber-attacks, said it would stop protecting 8chan at midnight Pacific Time (08:00 BST) on Monday. The 21-year-old suspect in this weekendâs shooting in El Paso, Texas, is understood to have used 8chan to spread his manifesto. Previously, the site was also used by the suspect in Marchâs shooting in Christchurch, New Zealand, as well as the suspect in April's synagogue shooting in Poway, California. Losing Cloudflareâs protection has made 8chan vulnerable to a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack, whereby a website is bombarded with traffic that overwhelms its servers, rendering it inaccessible. A few minutes after the Cloudflare service was withdrawn, 8chan did indeed become unavailable. What is 8chan? However, 8chan's site administrator says it was moving to another security firm, BitMitigate, based in the US state of Washington. BitMitigate's website says it has ""a proven commitment to liberty"". BitMitigate stepped in to help neo-Nazi site the Daily Stormer when it lost Cloudflare protection in 2017. The BBC has approached BitMitigate for comment. But at this time 8Chan remains offline. Cloudflare chief executive Matthew Prince had said, in the wake of Saturdayâs shootings, that his firm would continue to support 8chan as its policy was to remain neutral over the type of content the service protected. However, on Sunday evening Mr Prince wrote in a blog post,externalthat ""8chan has repeatedly proven itself to be a cesspool of hateâ. âThey have proven themselves to be lawless and that lawlessness has caused multiple tragic deaths,â Mr Prince wrote. ""Even if 8chan may not have violated the letter of the law in refusing to moderate their hate-filled community, they have created an environment that revels in violating its spirit.â Mr Prince warned that while 8chan would be disrupted by Cloudflareâs decision, it would likely be able to rebuild itself - as was the case when Cloudflare stopped providing protection for the Daily Stormer, a neo-Nazi site, in 2017. âThey quickly came back online using a Cloudflare competitor,â Mr Prince wrote. ""That competitor at the time promoted as a feature the fact that they didn't respond to legal process. He added: ""I have little doubt we'll see the same happen with 8chan. While removing 8chan from our network takes heat off of us, it does nothing to address why hateful sites fester online. It does nothing to address why mass shootings occur. It does nothing to address why portions of the population feel so disenchanted they turn to hate. ""In taking this action we've solved our own problem, but we haven't solved the internetâs.â The two companies protect websites from attacks, as well as making websites load more quickly for legitimate users. They can be thought of as a kind of bouncer or security guard for websites that get a large amount of traffic, or may be a likely target of cyber-attacks. They use technology that can verify where internet traffic is coming from and what it is trying to do. They can distinguish whether the visitor is a genuine person, a network of automated bots that is being used to flood a website or requests that keep servers too busy to handle normal uses. They are meant to block any attempts from ""bad"" traffic getting through. Cloudflare provides protection for more than 12 million websites, and is expected to float on the stock market later this year. Chief executive Matthew Prince has expressed concernat the power his company has to decide whether or not a website is able to exist on the open internet. 8chan is a forum created in 2013 by Fredrick Brennan as an alternative to 4chan, a message board popular with gamers. 8chan promised less moderation of controversial topics and images that were being removed from 4chan. As such, 8chan has hosted far-right extremist views and imagery. Mr Brennan gave up ownership of 8chan in 2015 and has since called for it to be shut down. Following Cloudflareâs announcement, he wrote on Twitter: ""Thank you so much@CloudFlare,externalFinally this nightmare might have an end.â 8chan is now owned and run by Jim Watkins, a former US army veteran, believed to be living in the Philippines.

"Farm vehicles and livestock theft have both increased, according to NFU Mutual claims data Britain's rolling green pastures and country lanes have witnessed a spike in criminals targeting farms, new data shows. Losses to British farmers from theft hit a seven-year high of Â£50m in 2018, according to rural insurer NFU Mutual. A 26% rise in claims for stolen farm vehicles, such as tractors and quad-bikes, to Â£7.4m last year, was behind the overall increase. Animal theft claims rose 3.7% to Â£2.5m in 2018, the company said. As a result of the crimes, farmers are reporting increased levels of anxiety and isolation to NFU Mutual agents. Tim Price, from the NFU Mutual, said: ""Farmers and country people are suffering from high levels of anxiety due to repeated thefts by gangs who take advantage of  farms' isolated locations to steal machinery, raid tool stores and even butcher sheep in the fields. ""In a single generation, country people have seen rural crime change from the opportunist theft of a single lamb, to brazen heists of tractors worth over Â£100,000 and rustlers stealing hundreds of sheep,"" Mr Price added. Jimmy and Esther Pritt's Leicestershire dairy farm has 17 different entrances, so the thief they believe stole their Collie-x-Huntaway work dog Rabbit had many getaway options to choose from. The couple were on holiday in Cornwall in July last year when a relief worker called to say Rabbit was missing. Rabbit the farm dog is presumed stolen from a dairy farm in Leicestershire Mrs Pritt believes Rabbit - who they valued at between Â£4,000 and Â£5,000 - was likely stolen for sheep rustling work further north. ""Rabbit was a rare dog in that she would work for anybody, rustle sheep or cattle, work day or night. From a commercial point of view, she was very, very valuable"". Mrs Pritt said the loss of their work dog was more than simply a business cost. ""Rabbit was our right-hand-dog. My husband works alone on the farm a lot of the time, so Rabbit was a companion and a friend to him as well. ""It was like a family member was taken,"" Mrs Pritt said. The Pritts have since increased security across their farm following the loss of their farm dog, altering their entrance gates and welcoming a guard dog to their property. NFU Mutual said some rural communities feel ""under siege"" by repeated crime activity, but are turning to technology to increase security in their sometimes-isolated locations. The insurer pointed to innovations such as geo-fencing, which triggers an alarm if tractors go beyond farm boundaries, and livestock marking which puts thousands of micro-dots into their animals' fleeces, as technology which can help farmers. ""While the rise in the cost of rural theft is a huge disappointment, we are convinced it would be much higher without the investment in rural security by thousands of farmers and higher commitment from many police forces to fighting rural crime,"" said Mr Price.

"Ambulance staff dealt with the casualty at the scene A teenager was still being questioned after a six-year-old boy was thrown five floors from the 10th floor of the Tate Modern art gallery in London. The boy, who landed on the fifth floor roof, is in a stable but critical condition following the fall on Sunday. A witness said they heard a ""loud bang"", before seeing a woman scream: ""Where's my son, where's my son?"" A 17-year-old boy arrested on suspicion of attempted murder remains in police custody. The Met Police said the six-year-old was thrown from a viewing platform. The emergency services arrived in force at Tate Modern after the boy's fall ""We treated a person at the scene and took them to hospital as a priority,"" a London Ambulance Service (LAS) spokesman said. The boy was taken to hospital by air ambulance after he fell at about 14:45 BST. A police spokesman said there was ""nothing to suggest [the suspect] is known to the victim"". The teenager had remained on the platform after the boy fell, police said. Visitors were initially locked inside the gallery at Bankside on the South Bank. Admin worker Nancy Barnfield, 47, of Rochdale, was at the 10th floor viewing gallery with a friend and their children when her friend heard a ""loud bang"". Ms Barnfield said she turned around and saw a woman screaming: ""Where's my son, where's my son?"" Members of the public quickly gathered around a man who was nearby, she said. Ms Barnfield said: ""We did not notice the mum before, we noticed her after because she was hysterical by then."" She said the person who was restrained by members of the public before the police arrived ""just stood there and was quite calm"". Olga Malchevska, who was also on the 10th floor, said she heard a scream and then headed to the exit with her child. ""Some people started panicking. We got to the packed lift. People there were saying that one boy threw another one from the balcony. We were all shocked."" A London Air Ambulance helicopter takes off from outside the Tate Modern Stuart Haggas said he saw emergency crews moving along the roof between the gallery's Turbine Hall and its recent extension. ""They were carrying a stretcher with someone on it, plus a second stretcher was waiting by the door,"" he said. BBC correspondent Jonny Dymond, who was also there, said visitors were ""funnelled towards the main Turbine Hall and the exits were all closed"". ""There were quite a lot of families with children, and security guards told us we couldn't leave,"" he said. ""There were at least two fire engines, 10 police cars and an incident control unit. Parts of the exterior of the building were taped off."" The Tate Modern opened in the disused power station on the River Thames in 2000. It was the UK's most popular tourist attraction in 2018 with 5.9 million visitors, according to the Association of Leading Visitor Attractions. Were you in the area when this happened?

"Tens of thousands of troops have been deployed in Kashmir Top politicians in Indian-administered Kashmir have been put under house arrest, days after thousands of troops were deployed to the disputed region. Public meetings have been banned and reports say mobile networks and the internet have been restricted. Last week authorities also ordered tourists and Hindu pilgrims to leave, citing a ""terror threat"" against an annual pilgrimage to a major shrine. It is unclear what is behind the latest moves, which have stoked tensions. No explanation for the government's actions has been given as yet but it comes amid speculation that Delhi might be poised to revoke some of Kashmir's special privileges - specifically Article 35A, a constitutional provision, which among other things, prevents people from outside the state buying land there. A cabinet meeting to discuss the situation has ended and home minister Amit Shah will address parliament. This video can not be played 'We are scared to stay here' - Tourists react to terror threat alert Kashmir has been under governor's rule since June 2018 when the governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) pulled out of a state government coalition with the regional People's Democratic Party (PDP). It was in the early hours of Monday that two former chief ministers of Indian-administered Kashmir, Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti, were placed under house arrest. The two leaders tweeted late on Sunday night about their impending house arrests and the situation there. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The federal government has not made an official statement. But they have cited security concerns while deploying tens of thousands of troops to the Muslim-majority valley in the past week. The influx of troops, the terror warnings and the speculation about Kashmir's status have alarmed residents across the Indian-ruled region, many of whom queued for hours outside petrol stations, supermarkets and cash machines. If Article 35A is indeed revoked, it would spark anger across the valley, and escalate tensions with Pakistan. Pakistan's dilemma over militants Why India and Pakistan fight over Kashmir There have also been reports of skirmishes across the de facto border with Pakistan in recent days. Kashmir has been a flashpoint between the nuclear-armed neighbours for decades. Both countries claim the entire valley, but control only parts of it. They have fought two wars and a limited conflict in the region. India accuses Pakistan of backing militant groups based in Kashmir, which Pakistan denies. Article 35A is a part of Article 370, which allows the state its own constitution, a separate flag and independence over all matters except foreign affairs, defence and communications. This provision guarantees Kashmir a unique status within India. Article 35A itself allows the legislature of Indian-administered Kashmir to define who the state's ""permanent residents"" are, and what distinguishes them. It applies to all of Indian-administered Kashmir, including Jammu and Ladakh. Alarmed residents have queued for hours outside petrol stations All identified residents are issued a permanent resident certificate, which entitles them to special benefits related to employment, as well as scholarships and other privileges. But the biggest advantage for permanent residents is that only they have the right to own and, therefore, buy, property in the state. But Article 35A was introduced by a presidential order in 1954, without seeking the consent of parliament. Some constitutional experts believe this means it can be revoked in the same manner - through a presidential order - while others say such a move could still be challenged in court since it would be unprecedented. Read more about Article 35A here Article 35A is a sensitive law because its restrictions on who can buy or own property protect the state's distinct demographic character. Many Kashmiris have long suspected Hindu nationalist groups are encouraging Hindus to migrate to the state. They see revoking Article 35A as further proof of this. But the ruling BJP has long vowed to revoke the law. Its 2019 election manifesto said it was ""discriminatory against non-permanent residents and women of Kashmir"", adding: ""We believe that Article 35A is an obstacle in the development of the state."" India has been fighting an armed insurgency in Kashmir since 1989. High unemployment and allegations of human rights abuses by Indian security forces have aggravated the problem. Kashmir's special status, experts say, is especially significant given this fraught relationship. Any attempt to dilute the status is seen by many as a violation of Kashmir's autonomy. Schools in the valley have been closed Earlier, the detained politicians and other leaders issued a resolution warning Delhi of ""consequences"" if it ""changed the special status of Kashmir"". The election where no one came to vote The ""studious"" 12-year-old victim of India's Kashmir problem Kashmir profile The BJP has a decisive majority - it won 300 of the 543 seats in the lower house of parliament earlier this year. This will likely help the government weather the political storm that is likely to follow, as revoking the law is expected to lead to constitutional and legal challenges.

"About 7,000 litres of water a minute are being pumped from the reservoir Crews need to spend at least two more days pumping water from a reservoir to stop its dam bursting and flooding a town, firefighters have said. Whaley Bridge residents are spending a fifth day out of their homes because of the partial collapse of the dam wall. Toddbrook Reservoir is 46% full but needs to drop to 25% before the 1,500 people evacuated are allowed home. The government said it was considering a national review into the structural safety of dams across the country. The Department for Environmental, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said the focus was on Whaley Bridge but it would be ""following the advice of expert engineers on the best way forward"". Photos show how the water levels at the reservoir have dropped since Friday Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has visited the dam, following Boris Johnson's visit on Friday. Escorted by High Peak's Labour MP Ruth George, Mr Corbyn thanked emergency service workers for their efforts, expressed sympathy to residents and said an inquiry would need to take place. ""Hopefully people will be able to return to their homes but of course there has to be then the question of long-term repair to the dam and the safety of it in the future,"" he said. ""There has to be an inquiry. An inquiry to make sure all the co-ordination worked effectively, and everything I have seen shows it did, but there are always lessons to be learned."" This video can not be played Whaley Bridge: Couple evacuated days before wedding The dam is said to be ""relatively stable"" after four days of efforts to bolster it. But Derbyshire deputy chief fire officer Gavin Tomlinson said the operation would continue ""for a few days yet"". Crews using 23 high-volume pumps have removed more than a third of the reservoir's water since part of its spillway collapsed on Thursday following heavy rainfall. Jeremy Corbyn was given the latest on the operation to pump water from the reservoir Mr Tomlinson said: ""We're now below half the level we want and we're now aiming for about 25%. ""If the calculations are right we should be able to get below the level of the damage on the dam wall which will allow the engineers and the specialists to assess it. ""As soon as we get the water level down to a safe level, then the emergency phase is over and then the contractors can look at the repairing of the dam wall."" This video can not be played Drone footage shows Whaley Bridge's new road RAF Chinooks have dropped more than 500 tonnes of aggregate into the damaged section of the wall to reinforce it. Wing Cdr John Coles said: ""I think the assessment is now that actually the dam is relatively stable."" By Keith Doyle, BBC News Much of the town lies beneath the reservoir's water level A quiet rural field at the edge of the Toddbrook reservoir is now at the centre of a massive engineering operation, with 10 high-volume pumps in a line along a hastily constructed road. In the water there are another 12 pumps submerged, and every so often as the water levels drop they have to be turned off and moved back into the water. Locals have moved cars and livestock and allowed the emergency services to break down walls and fences to get access. They say any inconvenience they are experiencing is nothing compared to what the evacuated residents from the other side of the dam are going through, and in the meantime they are supplying food and drinks to workers from the safe side of the reservoir. While this is not over, there is a feeling among the emergency services - and the locals that have come to watch the operation - that the critical dangerous stage has passed. The Canal and River Trust, which owns the dam,said it carried out an annual inspection of the structure in Novemberand it was ""absolutely fine"". Watersafe UK, a charity specialising in search and rescue operations, said it had 20 teams on standby to assist if the dam burst. RAF Chinooks have dropped more than 500 tonnes of aggregate Rachel Swann said people refusing to leave their homes were putting themselves and officers in danger Police have sharply criticised 20 residents from 16 homes who are refusing to leave. Deputy Chief Constable Rachel Swann said: ""We've evacuated this because there is a real prospect that the dam could fail, and if it fails it is catastrophic. ""People would die if they were in that evacuation zone. So those people who remain in that zone are putting their lives at risk.

"Tens of thousands of troops have been deployed in Kashmir Top politicians in Indian-administered Kashmir have been put under house arrest, days after thousands of troops were deployed to the disputed region. Public meetings have been banned and reports say mobile networks and the internet have been restricted. Last week authorities also ordered tourists and Hindu pilgrims to leave, citing a ""terror threat"" against an annual pilgrimage to a major shrine. It is unclear what is behind the latest moves, which have stoked tensions. No explanation for the government's actions has been given as yet but it comes amid speculation that Delhi might be poised to revoke some of Kashmir's special privileges - specifically Article 35A, a constitutional provision, which among other things, prevents people from outside the state buying land there. A cabinet meeting to discuss the situation has ended and home minister Amit Shah will address parliament. This video can not be played 'We are scared to stay here' - Tourists react to terror threat alert Kashmir has been under governor's rule since June 2018 when the governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) pulled out of a state government coalition with the regional People's Democratic Party (PDP). It was in the early hours of Monday that two former chief ministers of Indian-administered Kashmir, Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti, were placed under house arrest. The two leaders tweeted late on Sunday night about their impending house arrests and the situation there. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The federal government has not made an official statement. But they have cited security concerns while deploying tens of thousands of troops to the Muslim-majority valley in the past week. The influx of troops, the terror warnings and the speculation about Kashmir's status have alarmed residents across the Indian-ruled region, many of whom queued for hours outside petrol stations, supermarkets and cash machines. If Article 35A is indeed revoked, it would spark anger across the valley, and escalate tensions with Pakistan. Pakistan's dilemma over militants Why India and Pakistan fight over Kashmir There have also been reports of skirmishes across the de facto border with Pakistan in recent days. Kashmir has been a flashpoint between the nuclear-armed neighbours for decades. Both countries claim the entire valley, but control only parts of it. They have fought two wars and a limited conflict in the region. India accuses Pakistan of backing militant groups based in Kashmir, which Pakistan denies. Article 35A is a part of Article 370, which allows the state its own constitution, a separate flag and independence over all matters except foreign affairs, defence and communications. This provision guarantees Kashmir a unique status within India. Article 35A itself allows the legislature of Indian-administered Kashmir to define who the state's ""permanent residents"" are, and what distinguishes them. It applies to all of Indian-administered Kashmir, including Jammu and Ladakh. Alarmed residents have queued for hours outside petrol stations All identified residents are issued a permanent resident certificate, which entitles them to special benefits related to employment, as well as scholarships and other privileges. But the biggest advantage for permanent residents is that only they have the right to own and, therefore, buy, property in the state. But Article 35A was introduced by a presidential order in 1954, without seeking the consent of parliament. Some constitutional experts believe this means it can be revoked in the same manner - through a presidential order - while others say such a move could still be challenged in court since it would be unprecedented. Read more about Article 35A here Article 35A is a sensitive law because its restrictions on who can buy or own property protect the state's distinct demographic character. Many Kashmiris have long suspected Hindu nationalist groups are encouraging Hindus to migrate to the state. They see revoking Article 35A as further proof of this. But the ruling BJP has long vowed to revoke the law. Its 2019 election manifesto said it was ""discriminatory against non-permanent residents and women of Kashmir"", adding: ""We believe that Article 35A is an obstacle in the development of the state."" India has been fighting an armed insurgency in Kashmir since 1989. High unemployment and allegations of human rights abuses by Indian security forces have aggravated the problem. Kashmir's special status, experts say, is especially significant given this fraught relationship. Any attempt to dilute the status is seen by many as a violation of Kashmir's autonomy. Schools in the valley have been closed Earlier, the detained politicians and other leaders issued a resolution warning Delhi of ""consequences"" if it ""changed the special status of Kashmir"". The election where no one came to vote The ""studious"" 12-year-old victim of India's Kashmir problem Kashmir profile The BJP has a decisive majority - it won 300 of the 543 seats in the lower house of parliament earlier this year. This will likely help the government weather the political storm that is likely to follow, as revoking the law is expected to lead to constitutional and legal challenges.

"This video can not be played Donald Trump spoke to reporters before boarding Air Force One A shooting at a supermarket in the US state of Texas that left 20 dead is being investigated as domestic terrorism, officials say. A 21-year-old white man was arrested at the scene of the attack in the city of El Paso, near the US-Mexico border. He is believed to have posted an online document calling the attack a response to ""the Hispanic invasion of Texas"". Police on Sunday said he had been charged with capital murder,  meaning he could face the death penalty. US President Donald Trump has said ""perhaps more has to be done"" to prevent mass shootings following the El Paso attack andanother in Ohio 13 hours later in which nine people, including the gunman's sister, were killed. ""Hate has no place in our country, and we are going to take care of it,"" he told reporters on Sunday. ""This has been going on for years, for years and years in our country and we have to get it stopped."" The president went on to link both attacks to a ""mental illness problem"". ""If you look at both of these cases, this is mental illness. These are people who are very, very seriously mentally ill,"" he said. But critics argue that the roots of the two massacres lie in the president's language about immigrants and Mexicans in particular, and his opposition to gun control. The El Paso gunman opened fire on a crowded Walmart on Saturday with an assault-style rifle and surrendered after being confronted by police officers outside the store. Twenty-six people were injured in the shooting. This video can not be played Police were filmed responding to the shootings ""We're treating this as a domestic terrorist case,"" John Bash, the US Attorney for the Western District of Texas, told a news conference on Sunday. He said the attack appeared ""to be designed to intimidate a civilian population, to say the least"". The suspect has been named by US media as Patrick Crusius, a resident of Allen, in the Dallas area, about 650 miles (1,046km) east of El Paso. It is not yet clear how long before the attack he had gone to the city. US stunned by two mass shootings in 24 hours Will anything change this time? He is believed to be the author of a text posted on 8chan, an online message board frequently used by the far right, which describes a ""cultural and ethnic replacement brought on by an invasion"" in alluding to Hispanic people in the US. The four-page document, reportedly posted some 20 minutes before police received the first emergency call from the Walmart, also expresses support for the gunman who killed 51 people in Christchurch, New Zealand, in March. He has been co-operating with investigators, according to police, and has reportedly told them he acted alone. The shooting, believed to be the eighth deadliest in modern US history, took place in a city where most of the population of 680,000 is of Hispanic descent. The victims have not yet been named but Mexico's President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador said six Mexican nationals were among the dead and seven others were injured. Security camera images said to be of the attacker show an armed man in a dark T-shirt wearing eye glasses and what appear to be ear protectors. Footage of the gunman was filmed by security cameras Reports of an active shooter were received at 10:39 local time (16:39 GMT), and law enforcement officers were on the scene within six minutes, police said. The Walmart, near the Cielo Vista Mall, was full of shoppers buying back-to-school supplies at the time of the shooting, and witnesses described scenes of chaos as customers fled for their lives. #ElPasoStrong trends as city pulls together America's gun culture in 10 charts ""People were panicking and running, saying that there was a shooter,"" Kianna Long told Reuters news agency. ""They were running close to the floor, people were dropping on the floor."" Ms Long said she and her husband ran through a stock room before taking cover with other customers. By Lauren Turner, BBC News, El Paso ""Yesterday I was in shock. Today, my heart is hurting."" Gilda Baeza Ortega is looking at the Walmart building in disbelief from across a car park. She had been on the way to the store, but then decided to go for breakfast with her parents instead. But it is not just that that makes her feel so close to what has happened. ""It's the fact he was targeting us. I'm a Mexican-American and very proud of that. To me that is the biggest wound."" People have been coming here all day to lay flowers, a cross, even a Rubik's cube, in tribute. Some are also asking police when they can retrieve their cars from Walmart's car park. It is a popular place for people to come shopping from Mexico, and many now cannot make the return journey as their passports are locked in their vehicles. Everyone talks of what a friendly place El Paso is, how everyone knows each other. A taxi driver mentions the ""six degrees of separation"" here. She is dreading the list of names coming out, worried she knows one of the victims. Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke, an El Paso native, told CNN that Mr Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric had stoked divisions: ""He's an open avowed racist and is encouraging more racism in this country."" Also on CNN, New Jersey Senator Cory Booker, another Democratic presidential hopeful, said:  ""Donald Trump is responsible for this. He is responsible because he is stoking fears and hatred and bigotry."" But acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney rejected the Democrats' allegations and attributed the attacks to ""sick"" individuals, saying on ABC: ""There's no benefit here in trying to make this a political issue, this is a social issue and we need to address it as that."" This video can not be played After the Las Vegas attack in October 2017 the BBC looked at how US mass shootings are getting worse Mr Trump, who has made curbing illegal immigration one of the key points of his presidency, has previously made derogatory comments about Mexican migrants and has called large groups of migrants trying to reach the US an ""invasion"". In recent weeks, Mr Trump has been accused of racism after his attacks on members of Congress who are members of racial or ethnic minorities. Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard said his government planned to seek legal measures to protect Mexicans and Mexican-Americans in the US. Speaking at a news conference on Sunday, Mr Ebrard said the attorney general was considering litigation claiming that terrorism was committed against Mexicans in the shooting. Such an action could lead to the extradition of the gunman, he said. ""For Mexico, this individual is a terrorist,"" he told reporters. By Gordon Corera, BBC security correspondent The El Paso shooting fits a growing and disturbing trend of far-right violence internationally. Like the attack in Christchurch, the suspected attacker fits a particular profile - an individual who may have acted alone but who inhabited an international online subculture of extremism, one in which others incite and encourage violent acts. A document which authorities have linked to the attacker was posted online and was characteristic in its claims about population replacement (in New Zealand it was Muslims, in El Paso, Hispanics). And again, as in Christchurch, just before he acted the individual allegedly posted his intentions on the online forum 8chan. The pressure may grow now to act against such platforms and also for the authorities to take this growing threat more seriously, especially in the US. Did you witness what happened?

"About 7,000 litres of water a minute are being pumped from the reservoir Crews need to spend at least two more days pumping water from a reservoir to stop its dam bursting and flooding a town, firefighters have said. Whaley Bridge residents are spending a fifth day out of their homes because of the partial collapse of the dam wall. Toddbrook Reservoir is 46% full but needs to drop to 25% before the 1,500 people evacuated are allowed home. The government said it was considering a national review into the structural safety of dams across the country. The Department for Environmental, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said the focus was on Whaley Bridge but it would be ""following the advice of expert engineers on the best way forward"". Photos show how the water levels at the reservoir have dropped since Friday Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has visited the dam, following Boris Johnson's visit on Friday. Escorted by High Peak's Labour MP Ruth George, Mr Corbyn thanked emergency service workers for their efforts, expressed sympathy to residents and said an inquiry would need to take place. ""Hopefully people will be able to return to their homes but of course there has to be then the question of long-term repair to the dam and the safety of it in the future,"" he said. ""There has to be an inquiry. An inquiry to make sure all the co-ordination worked effectively, and everything I have seen shows it did, but there are always lessons to be learned."" This video can not be played Whaley Bridge: Couple evacuated days before wedding The dam is said to be ""relatively stable"" after four days of efforts to bolster it. But Derbyshire deputy chief fire officer Gavin Tomlinson said the operation would continue ""for a few days yet"". Crews using 23 high-volume pumps have removed more than a third of the reservoir's water since part of its spillway collapsed on Thursday following heavy rainfall. Jeremy Corbyn was given the latest on the operation to pump water from the reservoir Mr Tomlinson said: ""We're now below half the level we want and we're now aiming for about 25%. ""If the calculations are right we should be able to get below the level of the damage on the dam wall which will allow the engineers and the specialists to assess it. ""As soon as we get the water level down to a safe level, then the emergency phase is over and then the contractors can look at the repairing of the dam wall."" This video can not be played Drone footage shows Whaley Bridge's new road RAF Chinooks have dropped more than 500 tonnes of aggregate into the damaged section of the wall to reinforce it. Wing Cdr John Coles said: ""I think the assessment is now that actually the dam is relatively stable."" By Keith Doyle, BBC News Much of the town lies beneath the reservoir's water level A quiet rural field at the edge of the Toddbrook reservoir is now at the centre of a massive engineering operation, with 10 high-volume pumps in a line along a hastily constructed road. In the water there are another 12 pumps submerged, and every so often as the water levels drop they have to be turned off and moved back into the water. Locals have moved cars and livestock and allowed the emergency services to break down walls and fences to get access. They say any inconvenience they are experiencing is nothing compared to what the evacuated residents from the other side of the dam are going through, and in the meantime they are supplying food and drinks to workers from the safe side of the reservoir. While this is not over, there is a feeling among the emergency services - and the locals that have come to watch the operation - that the critical dangerous stage has passed. The Canal and River Trust, which owns the dam,said it carried out an annual inspection of the structure in Novemberand it was ""absolutely fine"". Watersafe UK, a charity specialising in search and rescue operations, said it had 20 teams on standby to assist if the dam burst. RAF Chinooks have dropped more than 500 tonnes of aggregate Rachel Swann said people refusing to leave their homes were putting themselves and officers in danger Police have sharply criticised 20 residents from 16 homes who are refusing to leave. Deputy Chief Constable Rachel Swann said: ""We've evacuated this because there is a real prospect that the dam could fail, and if it fails it is catastrophic. ""People would die if they were in that evacuation zone. So those people who remain in that zone are putting their lives at risk. ""They are also putting the lives of the responders, primarily the police, at risk because we have to keep going in and speaking to them and asking them to leave."" 'We have nothing.

"Farm vehicles and livestock theft have both increased, according to NFU Mutual claims data Britain's rolling green pastures and country lanes have witnessed a spike in criminals targeting farms, new data shows. Losses to British farmers from theft hit a seven-year high of Â£50m in 2018, according to rural insurer NFU Mutual. A 26% rise in claims for stolen farm vehicles, such as tractors and quad-bikes, to Â£7.4m last year, was behind the overall increase. Animal theft claims rose 3.7% to Â£2.5m in 2018, the company said. As a result of the crimes, farmers are reporting increased levels of anxiety and isolation to NFU Mutual agents. Tim Price, from the NFU Mutual, said: ""Farmers and country people are suffering from high levels of anxiety due to repeated thefts by gangs who take advantage of  farms' isolated locations to steal machinery, raid tool stores and even butcher sheep in the fields. ""In a single generation, country people have seen rural crime change from the opportunist theft of a single lamb, to brazen heists of tractors worth over Â£100,000 and rustlers stealing hundreds of sheep,"" Mr Price added. Jimmy and Esther Pritt's Leicestershire dairy farm has 17 different entrances, so the thief they believe stole their Collie-x-Huntaway work dog Rabbit had many getaway options to choose from. The couple were on holiday in Cornwall in July last year when a relief worker called to say Rabbit was missing. Rabbit the farm dog is presumed stolen from a dairy farm in Leicestershire Mrs Pritt believes Rabbit - who they valued at between Â£4,000 and Â£5,000 - was likely stolen for sheep rustling work further north. ""Rabbit was a rare dog in that she would work for anybody, rustle sheep or cattle, work day or night. From a commercial point of view, she was very, very valuable"". Mrs Pritt said the loss of their work dog was more than simply a business cost. ""Rabbit was our right-hand-dog. My husband works alone on the farm a lot of the time, so Rabbit was a companion and a friend to him as well. ""It was like a family member was taken,"" Mrs Pritt said. The Pritts have since increased security across their farm following the loss of their farm dog, altering their entrance gates and welcoming a guard dog to their property. NFU Mutual said some rural communities feel ""under siege"" by repeated crime activity, but are turning to technology to increase security in their sometimes-isolated locations. The insurer pointed to innovations such as geo-fencing, which triggers an alarm if tractors go beyond farm boundaries, and livestock marking which puts thousands of micro-dots into their animals' fleeces, as technology which can help farmers. ""While the rise in the cost of rural theft is a huge disappointment, we are convinced it would be much higher without the investment in rural security by thousands of farmers and higher commitment from many police forces to fighting rural crime,"" said Mr Price.

"John Flint is giving up the role he held for 18 months ""by mutual agreement with the board"" The chief executive of HSBC has stepped down after the bank said it needed a change in leadership to address a ""challenging global environment"". John Flint is giving up the role he has held for a year-and-a-half ""by mutual agreement with the board"". He will immediately cease his day-to-day responsibilities at HSBC, but will help with the transition as Noel Quinn takes over as interim chief executive. Chairman Mark Tucker thanked Mr Flint for his ""commitment"" and ""dedication"". However, he said: ""In the increasingly complex and challenging global environment in which the bank operates, the board believes a change is needed to meet the challenges that we face and to capture the very significant opportunities before us."" HSBC profits hit by China slowdown HSBC sparks controversy with new ad campaign HSBC made the surprise announcement as it reported a 15.8% rise in pre-tax profit to $12.4bn (Â£10.2bn) for the six months to 30 June. Mr Flint, who has worked at HSBC for 30 years, said: ""I have agreed with the board that today's good interim results indicate that this is the right time for change, both for me and the bank."" The 51-year-old ran the bank's retail and wealth management business before taking over as chief executive last year. At that time, Mr Flint was seen as a safe choice for the top job. HSBC portrays itself as a conservative bank.  Unlike some rivals, it has never pursued the wilder excesses of investment banking, and has a proud record of appointing its chief executive and chairman from within. It is part of the establishment in Asia and the West, and makes its money from the giant trade flows between. With a 30-year track record at the bank, John Flint appeared the safest of hands when appointed 18 months ago. The bank's shares have fallen during his tenure, but the increasing trade tensions between America and China explain most of the fall. Mr Flint will be a ""good leaver"" - meaning he keeps his entitlement to most of his share options - and which rules out any idea his departure is linked to misconduct. Mr Flint was regarded as the favourite of his predecessor as chief executive, Stuart Gulliver - so it is possible that Mark Tucker, HSBC's chairman, has simply decided he wants his own man in the job. But the Huawei connection, although not confirmed by HSBC, cannot be discounted. In seeking to keep in the good books of the US authorities - which had a monitor embedded at the bank - HSBC provided the information that allowed America to apply for the extradition of Meng Wanzhou, Huawei's chief financial officer. That cannot have pleased Beijing, and HSBC is reliant on China's goodwill as much as America's. Mr Flint may have been the necessary sacrifice. Commenting on the current environment, HSBC said ""the outlook has changed"". It said that US interest rates were now expected to fall rather than rise and ""geopolitical issues could impact a significant number of our major markets"". It added: ""In the near term, the nature and impact of the UK's departure from the European Union remain highly uncertain."" Mr Flint has a 12-month notice period, but it is not clear when his departure date will be, because he has ""agreed to remain available to HSBC"". HSBC has also granted Mr Flint ""good leaver"" status, which means he will be entitled to any stock options that vest after he exits the bank, provided he does not work at a competitor for two years. The bank said it has begun a search to find a new chief executive and ""will be considering internal and external candidates"".

"The British-flagged Stena Impero is still being detained by Iran Iran has seized another foreign tanker in the Gulf, state media reports claim. Iranian forces seized the Iraqi ship for ""smuggling fuel for some Arab countries"" and detained seven sailors, according to the reports. Iraq's oil ministry has said it has no connection to the seized vessel and that it is working to gather information about it. The incident comes amid heightened tensions after the US tightened sanctions on Iran's oil sector. The sanctions were reimposed after Washington's unilateral withdrawal from a landmark 2015 nuclear deal. If confirmed, the Iraqi tanker would be the third foreign vessel to have been seized by Iran in recent weeks. On 13 July, the Iranian coastguard detained the Panama-flagged MT Riah. The Revolutionary Guards' Sepah News site said at the time that the ship was seized during naval patrols aimed at ""discovering and confronting organised smuggling"". Iran and the crisis in the Gulf explained Gulf crisis: Are we heading for a new tanker war? Also last month,Iran seized the British-flagged tanker the Stena Imperoin the Strait of Hormuz, saying it had collided with a fishing vessel. Fars news agency reported that the operation to seize the ship was carried out last Wednesday near the Gulf island of Farsi. The vessel was carrying about 700,000 litres (154,000 gallons) of fuel at the time, according to a Revolutionary Guard Corps commander quoted in state media. The tanker was reported to have been taken to Bushehr Port in south-western Iran and its fuel handed over to the authorities. Iranian reports say the tanker was Iraqi but the nationalities of the seven crew have not been disclosed. In a statement carried by the Iraqi News Agency, Iraq's oil ministry said it had no connection with the ship. ""The ministry does not export diesel to the international market,"" it said, adding that authorities were seeking more information about who the vessel belonged to. Two Iraqi port officials told Reuters news agency that initial information suggested that the ""small ship"" belonged to a private shipping company owned by an Iraqi trader. BBC Arab affairs editor Sebastian Usher says that though the cargo is relatively small, the seizure will inevitably raise tensions further in the region. Tensions have been high in the Gulf since the US tightened oil sanctions against Iran. The US has blamed Iran for two separate attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman in May and June - an allegation Tehran has denied. Iran also shot down a US surveillance drone over the Strait of Hormuz in disputed circumstances. This video can not be played In a previous seizure, Iran took control of a Panama-registered vessel on 13 July UK warships have meanwhile been shadowing British oil tankersin the area since Iran threatened to seize one in response to the impounding of an Iranian tanker off Gibraltar. They were, however, unable to prevent the seizure of the Stena Impero. The UK saidthe tanker impounded off Gibraltar was suspected of breaching EU sanctions against Syria. Iran denied it was heading there. Iran, tankers and the Gulf crisis explained 'Fuel-smuggling' tanker seized by Iran Gulf crisis: Are we heading for a new tanker war?

"Boris Johnson has given the green light to 20 new building and infrastructure projects in the NHS in England. The Â£850m package will pay for new wards, intensive care units and diagnostic centres as well as refurbishing some existing facilities over the next five years. Mr Johnson also said there would be an extra Â£1bn this year to improve and maintain existing buildings. But doubts have been raised over whether the money really is new. Mr Johnson said the Â£1bn for this year was extra - and would mean ""more beds, new wards, and extra life-saving equipment"". It will bring spending to Â£7bn during 2019-20. Is NHS buildings boost all it seems? When asked about staffing and recruitment problems faced by hospitals, Mr Johnson said the Â£1.8bn was ""on top of the Â£34bn that we're putting into the NHS"". ""But of course the lion's share of that will go on staffing, attracting, retaining, professionally developing the staff in the NHS,"" he said. He previously said he was ""determined to deliver"" on the promises of the 2016 EU referendum, after criticism of the Vote Leave campaign's claim that Â£350m a week was being sent to the EU and could be spent on the NHS instead. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the NHS was ""priority number one"" for the new prime minister. He said money for hospital upgrades was possible because the economy was growing and the funds would be available this year. Analysis by Nick Triggle, health correspondent The government has always promised it would be increasing capital funding in 2019-20. Last year's Budget said spending would rise from Â£5.9bn in 2018-19 to Â£6.7bn in the new financial year. But that was subsequently reduced. By the time Boris Johnson became prime minister, the plan was to spend Â£5.9bn again. After Monday's announcement that now increases to Â£7bn. So is the money new? Well certainly Â£300m of it is - and if you are being generous you could argue Â£1bn of it is from the situation when Mr Johnson took office. But even if we accept that it is all new money it is not a given that it will all end up improving the infrastructure of the health service. During the past five years, about Â£5bn less has been spent on capital than had been planned for. This is because significant sums - about a sixth of the capital budget - have been transferred into the day-to-day running pot to help balance the books. The truth is it will be at the end of the financial year only that we will be able to see whether this promised money has gone where it should - and even if it does, it could be argued it is just reversing the cuts seen in the past few years. Read more from Nick here Responding to the funding announcement, the Health Foundation said ""years of under-investment in the NHS's infrastructure means this extra money risks being little more than a drop in the ocean"". Ben Gershlick, from the charity, added that NHS facilities in England were ""in major disrepair"", with a Â£6bn maintenance backlog. Labour's shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said there was ""huge scepticism"" about whether the funding was new. Meanwhile, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the announcement today on funding for the NHS ""goes nowhere near paying for all the cuts over the past nine years"". Mr Corbyn said ""many hospitals had been left off"" and ""we need something a bit more comprehensive"". But the head of NHS England, Simon Stevens, said the money was a ""significant start"" to ""much needed capital investment"". ""The concrete steps being set out this week will mean investment flows directly to front-line services, providing new clinics and wards,"" he added. The prime minister announced the funding package on a visit to Pilgrim Hospital in Boston, Lincolnshire, which is receiving a Â£21.3m share of the money to improve its A&E department. Andrew Morgan, chief executive of United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust, which runs the hospital, told Radio 4's WATO programme that it was ""a small step, but a very positive one"". ""We have a huge backlog maintenance bill here,"" he said. Mr Morgan explained that staffing was still his top priority. But some hospitals, such as Liverpool Women's Hospital, missed out on funding. Its interim medical director Andrew Loughney said they needed Â£100m to rebuild the hospital, which he called ""a clinical priority"". ""Perhaps if we were in a marginal constituency, we would have been allocated the money,"" he said. The government said other parts of the UK would benefit too. Health is devolved, so Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland make decisions about spending on the NHS. But under funding rules there would be money made available to them, ministers said. Later this week, the government is also expected to announce changes to the NHS pension scheme after senior doctors said new rules meant they could not afford to work extra shifts to tackle waiting lists. One hospital said the rule change, which means ""punitive"" taxes for doctors who take additional shifts and exceed the limit for pensions contributions, wasthe equivalent of losing 60 consultants.
