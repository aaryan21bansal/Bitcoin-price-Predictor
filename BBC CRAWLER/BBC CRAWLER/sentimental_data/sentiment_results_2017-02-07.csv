"For the Times,MPs have been given a ""concession"",externalafter they were promised the chance to vote on Theresa May's deal with EU negotiators six months before the UK leaves the EU. The paper says Number 10 was ""forced into the move to avoid defeat"" at the hands of Labour and Tory rebels. Before the government's move to head off a rebellion, there were 20 Conservative MPs who were ready to defy Downing Street and vote against the government on Article 50 amendments, the paper says. According to the Guardian,external, however, the prime minister successfully ""faced down a Conservative rebellion over Brexit"". A potential Tory rebellion was ""virtually cancelled out"" by six pro-Brexit Labour MPs who voted with the government, it says. The government remains relatively confident the Brexit bill will pass its third and final Commons reading on Wednesday without changes, before heading to the Lords, the paper adds. The Daily Telegraph warns,externalthe European Union is facing a new Greek debt crisis. It claims the state of the government finances in Greece could destabilise the whole eurozone, and quotes the International Monetary Fund as saying a new bailout is needed. The paper notes that the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, is unwilling to send funds directly to Athens as she faces a tough re-election battle in the autumn. It predicts the Greek debt problems will come to the fore as soon as July, when the country is due to repay around 7bn euros to its creditors. The Guardian considers the government's white paper on the housing market in England and concludes it does nothing to confront what it callsthe country's ""housing crisis"",external. The paper says the government is not addressing the obsession of buyers in extending themselves to own a home. It says there needs to be an honest admission that there is no chance of building the extra 250,000 new homes a year that the government says are required. The Daily Telegraph reflects on the news that the Institute for Fiscal Studies thinks tax rises and cuts to public services are set to continue well into the next decade. In an editorial,,externalthe paper says the British state has regressed 30 years, threatening to reverse the direction of travel Margaret Thatcher struggled so hard to establish. It says that while it is admirable that the government wants to reduce the deficit, taxes have risen for seven years in a row - and another way of raising cash would be by reducing our foreign aid budget. The Times saysteachers are using police-style body cameras,externalto record misbehaving pupils. The paper says at least two comprehensives in England - both with a history of unruly pupils - are using the cameras to tackle ""constant low level disruption"". The Information Commissioner's Office - which regulates privacy issues - said that schools were free to use the technique as a ""self-reflection"" tool for students. In its editorial, the Times says,externalthat Commons Speaker John Bercow over-reached his office when he tried to pre-emptively bar US President Donald Trump from addressing Parliament. The paper says that while the speaker is entitled to his personal opinions, his comments smell of hypocrisy - having already invited the presidents of China, Kuwait and Indonesia to address MPs and peers. It says that while Mr Bercow has done a reasonable job as speaker, his desire for personal publicity has ""blighted his record"". In his column in the Daily Mail,external, Quentin Letts says Mr Bercow's criticism of the president is all the more surprising given the fact that he is a ""mini"" Trump himself. He says Mr Bercow is as greedy for attention as the president and has the same inflated self-regard. TheGuardian though says Mr Bercow did not over-reach his powers,external. The paper says he was right to intervene because, if Britain is truly pro-American, it cannot want Mr Trump's presidency to succeed. It says the president's temperament does not tolerate ""democratic restraint"" and he wants his whim enacted as law. And finally. They are the photos that show former US President Barack Obama ""as you've never seen him before"",according to the Sun,external. The photographs show Mr Obama learning to kitesurf while on holiday at Sir Richard Branson's luxurious Necker Island in the Caribbean. The ""worries of the White House are clearly far from Obama's mind"",says the Daily Mail,external. TheGuardian says US presidents,external""don't get to have very much fun"", however, ""whatever Barack Obama might be missing about the Oval Office, those restrictions don't appear to be one of them"". ""Branson challenged the ex-president to learn how to kiteboard before Branson himself could learn to foilboard, another young watersport that resembles water skiing. ""According to Branson's post, it was a challenge Obama easily won,"" the paper says.

"Former Football League chairman Greg Clarke was appointed FA chairman in August Football Association chairman Greg Clarke says he will quit if the organisation cannot win government support for its reform plans. A motion of no confidencein the FA is to be debated in the House of Commons on Thursday after five former FA executives said the governing body had failed to ""self-reform"". Clarke ""strongly disputes"" the motion, but accepts FA governance must change. ""I don't believe that the FA is failing football,"" he said. Clarke said the FA had a set of proposals ""to improve our governance"", which it would ratify and then take to sports minister Tracey Crouch for her approval. ""Delivering real change is my responsibility and I firmly believe this is critical for the future of the game,"" Clarke added. ""If the government is not supportive of the changes when they are presented in the coming months, I will take personal responsibility for that. ""I will have failed. I will be accountable for that failure and would in due course step down from my role."" The Commons Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee is leading an inquiry into football governance and as part of that, committee members have secured a debate in the Commons to ask whether the FA can ""comply fully with its duties"". They will also discuss whether reform is impossible within the FA's structure, and whether new laws should be proposed. But Clarke said the FA was ""not sitting idly by"", adding: ""Change won't be easy, but I am confident it will happen - and it will be substantial."" He says the governing body needs to: Be more diverse; Be more open about decision-making; Better represent those playing the game. This video can not be played Damian Collins MP: 'We no longer have any confidence' In July, Crouch said the FA would lose its Â£30m to Â£40m of public funding if it did not reform. Then, in December, she announced the government would bring in legislation to force through reforms if the governing body did not make changes itself. Select committee chairman Damian Collins MP revealed on Friday that the FA had been given six months to meet the government guidance on best practice for sports governance but had failed to do so. However, Clarke said he hoped those attending the debate were aware of ""the FA's duties and the great work we are actually doing"". ""Many people hear talk of an old-fashioned FA, but they don't actually realise how it works or what it does. That's a real shame,"" he said. Clarke said the FA was ""supporting the game from top to bottom"" and: It was investing record amounts into the grassroots game and changing the face of football in England. It had invested over Â£65m into grassroots football last year - more than any governing body in the world invests into a national sport. It was adapting to flexible formats of the game, with 12 million people playing every year. It had a plan in place to double its number of female players by 2020. It provided Â£22m every year for desperately needed new playing facilities. BBC Radio 5 live sports news correspondent Richard Conway Whisper it... but could change within the FA's corridors of power finally happen? The debate around governance reform has been going on for decades. Despite that, not a lot has changed since the FA was founded in the mid-19th Century. Greg Clarke has upped the stakes though. He will resign as chairman if he fails to deliver. It's a noble gesture but one which speaks to the confidence he clearly has in achieving some form of modernisation and gaining government approval. But his statement goes further, and Clarke clearly has the MPs who are staging Thursday's debate in his sights. As I reflected last week,there's growing indignation within Wembley over continually being called a failing organisation. There's a recognition that work needs to be done to increase diversity and to change a board structure whose members have been criticised for representing vested interests. But, as Clarke reflects, the FA's view is that it is very much meeting its role as a governing body. To that extent the statement is indicative of a leadership team determined to fight back against its critics and an attempt to recalibrate opinion, given their belief in the positive role the FA plays in promoting and protecting football.

"Sam Warburton captained Wales for the first time against the Barbarians in June 2011 at the age of just 22 Six Nations: Wales v England Venue:Principality StadiumDate:Saturday, 11 FebruaryKick-off:16:50 GMT Coverage:Live on BBC One Wales, S4C, BBC Radio Wales, BBC Radio Cymru & BBC Sport website and BBC Sport app, plus live text commentary Wales flanker Sam Warburton says Six Nations rivals England are justifiably regarded as being the equal of world champions New Zealand. Eddie Jones' side will arrive in Cardiff seeking a 16th successive win, three away from a world record. The All Blacks and South Africa share the tier-one nations' 18-match winning run record. ""England are deservedly tagged as the best team in the northern hemisphere,"" said Warburton. ""It's a fair judgement to compare them to the All Blacks right now - that's how good they are. ""It is going to take a huge game out of us to get a win, and it will be one of the biggest games of the championship for sure."" Warburton also explained the reasons he believes fire up every opponent England meet in the Six Nations. The ex-Wales captain insists it is down to England's recent successful record. ""Chatting to [different countries'] players, that's how they feel, they really prioritise that and everyone just wants to beat England,"" he said. ""That's due to the success in the past and the success they're going through now. It's always a big scalp."" Never miss a Six Nations story with BBC alerts Preparation time 'no excuse' for Wales Scarlets do expect Wales hooker Owens to join Pau International rugby began with Scotland and England meeting in 1879. Four years later the Home Nations tournament began with Wales and Ireland taking on England and Scotland. Since then, the Celtic nations have traditionally revelled in their rivalries with England. England are unbeaten under Jones, who succeeded Stuart Lancaster after their group-stage exit from the 2015 World Cup. Wales contributed to England's downfall in the tournament they hosted with a win at Twickenham, but lost twice to them in 2016. ""If you're Wales, the biggest game you play in in the Six Nations is England,"" said Warburton. ""If you're Scotland, it's England. If you're Ireland, it's England. Or if you're France or Italy, it's England,"" said Warburton, whose father was born in England. ""We know as players that's the one game the fans look forward to most and you sense that in the build-up. It's a huge occasion for everyone in Wales. ""But for me, I always cherish any win against any opposition in the Six Nations and in the last three years [since Wales' 2013 title win] I've realised how difficult it is to win a championship."" Cardiff Blues' Warburton predicts selection headaches if Bath number eightTaulupe Faletau has recovered from a knee injuryfor Saturday's match. Gloucester's Ross Moriarty played at eightin the opening victory in Italyand could rival Warburton for the blind-side flanker's role if Faletau is risked for a starting place. ""The back-row competition is so fierce at the minute, I don't want to put pressure on him, but Toby [Faletau], when he's playing well, is one of the best players in the world. I think he's fantastic,"" Warburton added. ""If he did come back I'm sure there would be a few selection headaches in the back-row because Ross and Justin [Tipuric] went extremely well against Italy.""

The president hastweeted,externalhis annoyance at what he calls poor reporting: ""The failing @nytimes was forced to apologise to its subscribers for the poor reporting it did on my election win. Now they are worse!"" Unsurprisingly, people have taken to social media to contradict Mr Spicer's bathrobe comment with various hashtags popping up, including #BathRobeGate. Some have even been delving into the presidential bathrobe archives to produce gems such as this from Avi Bueno. Hetweeted,externala photo of Ronald Reagan in a robe, with the caption: 'Weird to see @seanspicer and @realDonaldTrump getting all defensive about a #bathrobe when their hero wasn't shy about it.""

"Rio Ferdinand says he is yet to ""really flush everything out"" following his wife's death in 2015 As former footballer Rio Ferdinand reveals he is yet to ""grieve properly"" for his wife, who died in 2015, three men share their experiences of losing a partner. The football star'scommentscome ahead of a new BBC documentary about parents who lose their partners, after his wife Rebecca Ellison died of breast cancer, aged 34. The ex-Manchester United player's words rang true with Stephen Short, whose wife Verena died of breast cancer, aged 43, in August 2016. He also feels he is yet to grieve properly. ""I basically spent three months caring for my wife full time and then the day after I lost her, I was thrown into organising the funeral and dealing with all the vast amounts of paperwork,"" the aerospace engineer explains. ""It was, and still is, overwhelming. You're not given time to reflect on what happened.""

""I just couldn't afford to fall apart or my children would suffer,"" he says. ""I was amazed how I could put my grief in a box to open later, simply because I had two girls to bring up."" Rob says it took a year or two before he was able to ""fully process"" his wife's death. ""What helped was realising there wasn't a set way of working through it. Just doing it myself allowed me to move on when I was ready."" Rob admits it was the wives of his friends who he spoke to rather than the men - who didn't always ""know how to approach it"". ""Talk to somebody,"" he says, ""but if you think you are coping, don't feel bad about not breaking down and being strong."" Don't avoid the topic of death for fear of upsetting a child - make an environment where they can ask questions, be listened to and can hear answers But remember, children take things literally. Use honest words It's also ok to say ""I can't tell you now, but I will one day"" Accept that children are emotionally and psychologically damaged by bereavement. You can't measure the depth of grief Be aware there are secondary losses - there are often house moves associated with the death,  and fall-outs over money.

""My wife passed away in July 2016, the day before my 53rd birthday, after a very short period of illness,"" he says.

Paul Graves says he has not yet experienced the grief of losing his wife Julie He and his wife Julie, who was 63, had been married for almost 20 years. Paul says he threw himself back into his job at a bank ""to be occupied"" and avoid being home alone. ""The sympathy I got from friends - I found that more difficult.

"This video can not be played Donald Trump: ""All over Europe it's happening. It's gotten to a point where [attacks are] not even being reported."" US President Donald Trump has accused the media of under-reporting terror attacks, and produced a list to back up his claim. Is he right? While on a visit to US Central Command, a wing of the Department of Defense, he warned of the danger posed by the Islamic State group. ""You have seen what happened in Paris and Nice. All over Europe it's happening,"" he said. ""It's gotten to a point where it's not even being reported. And in many cases the very, very dishonest press doesn't want to report it. ""They have their reasons, and you understand that."" Later in the day, the White House published a list of attacks ""executed or inspired"" by IS. Before the list was published, press secretary Sean Spicer said there were ""several instances"" of attacks that had not gained sufficient media coverage (without specifying which fell into that category). We have reproduced the list below, explaining in each case what happened and whether we reported on it. Of the 78 incidents listed by the White House, we did not report only 12 of them - some were so minor they received barely any coverage elsewhere. Just because the BBC covered an attack does not mean that incident was not under-reported, although it is unclear whether Mr Trump was referring to US or global news organisations. And some terrorist incidents do get more coverage than others, a point that has been hotly debated on social media. Most of the atrocities listed by the White House were committed by Islamists, and the killing of nine black worshippers by a self-avowed white supremacist in South Carolina is notably absent. Absent too is the 2016 bombing of a shopping centre in Baghdad that killed some 300 people, and last week's deadly assault on a mosque in Quebec City. What happened: A teenager was shot dead after he stabbed two police officers. He was a ""known terror suspect"" whose passport had been cancelled on security grounds. Did we cover it?Yes.

"This year's Oscars ""class photo"" has been released - and as usual there are several quirks and questionable outfits. The picture sees 163 of this year's nominees gathered together and smiling away, but zoom in and there is a whole lot more going on. Here are just seven of the things we spotted in this year's photo. 1. Pharrell Williams didn't exactly dress for the occasion All of this year's male nominees are dressed smartly in tuxes and suits. Well, almost all. The ""dress code"" memo must have gone into Pharrell's junk email inbox, because he turned up wearing a green baseball cap and grey sweater. To be fair - the sweater does have the Nasa logo on it, a reference to best picture nominee Hidden Figures. Pharrell wrote several songs for the soundtrack to the film, which tells the story of three African-American women who worked behind the scenes at the space agency in the 1960s. 2. Michelle Williams is upstaged by Casey Affleck's facial hair Casey Affleck's facial hair is fast becoming the eighth wonder of the world. It gets longer with every awards ceremony he appears at this season. It's now on the verge of totally eclipsing poor Michelle Williams, Affleck's co-star in Manchester by the Sea, who has to peep out from behind his mane. She must be getting used to Affleck stealing her limelight. The actor appears in nearly every scene in the 137-minute movie, while Williams's screen time clocks in at 11 minutes. 3. The writer of Moonlight wants you to know how many nominations it has Tarell Alvin McCraney brightens up the back row of the photograph with his winning smile. He's the man behind the stage play In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue - which went on to become Moonlight, one of this year's most hotly-tipped Oscars contenders. McCraney is so pleased with the film's success he wants to let you know just how many Oscar nominations the film has received, and he is seen here holding up eight fingers. (There is, of course, another explanation. He could be making the ""305"" hand gesture - which is the area code for Miami-Dade county, his home and the place where Moonlight is set.) Also - hats off to Shawn Levy (who's standing next to Tarell), who wins the award for the most delightfully bright smile of the whole photo. He is the producer of Arrival, which is nominated for best picture. 4. Justin Timberlake needs to sack his tailor ""What's your inside leg measurement, Justin?"" ""I don't know, maybe 32 inches?"" ""Hmmm, I don't have enough material for that. Have a 28-inch pair of trousers instead."" ""Great, that'll do, thanks Derek."" 5. The front row is so where we wanna be Emma Stone, Matt Damon, Natalie Portman, Octavia Spencer are all sitting together in the front row. Can someone please organise for us to join this BFF group, that'd be great, thanks. Extra respect for Octavia Spencer for wearing a pair of white trousers while so many of the other female nominees are in a dress or skirt, and for Natalie Portman, who looks like she's wearing high heels even while pregnant with twins. (She is actually wearing her flat shoes and tipping her heels up. Crafty.) Also - Manchester by the Sea producer Kimberly Steward (far right) is that sweet kid in your class who was accidentally never looking at the camera in the school photo every single year. 6. Ryan Gosling needs to cheer up You're the lead actor in the jointly most-nominated film of all time, pal. Uncross your arms for goodness sake. Slightly happier to be there is the lovely Dev Patel, in the row in front, looking every inch the Hollywood star. He's come a long way from how he looked at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2009 when he was starring in Slumdog Millionaire. He told the BBC: ""I first came to Toronto in my school shoes and I had a blazer and I was with Frida [Pinto, his co-star] and they said 'You can't put this guy next to her because he looks so terrible'. I think I got a free penguin suit that didn't quite fit me and they gave me shoes."" This year, he's nominated for best supporting actor and is seen wearing a burgundy Valentino suit. Nice. 7. Is this gap for Meryl Streep? Missing nominees from the photo include Michael Shannon (nominated for best supporting actor for Nocturnal Animals) and Andrew Garfield (best actor, Hacksaw Ridge). But of course, the most notable absentee is Her Royal Acting Highness, Meryl Streep - who is up for best actress this year for her role in Florence Foster Jenkins. Maybe this gap in the back row behind Denzel Washington was intended for her, and she got held up in traffic. Alternatively, perhaps she's been to so many of these things she's just had enough. Either way, we're pretty sure she'll be at the ceremony. This year's Oscars, which will be hosted by Jimmy Kimmel, will take place in Hollywood, Los Angeles on 26 February.

"Mark Hepburn and his partner Laura bought a house with a 5% deposit Owning a home by the age of 25 has become an unachievable dream for many over the last two decades. Soaring property prices mean justone in five 25-year-olds own a property, compared to nearly half two decades ago, according to one recent study. But as the government unveils itsHousing White Paper,external, there are some young people who have managed to buck the trend - without help from the bank of mum and dad. Here four young homeowners - all couples - who bought properties in 2016 - reveal just how they did it. Name:Mark Hepburn, age 23. A debt collector on Â£18,500 a year Lives with:Partner Laura Starkie, age 25. An accountant on Â£20,000 a year Location:Oldham, Greater Manchester House price:Â£125,000 for a three bedroom semi-detached house Deposit:Â£6,250 (5%) with theHelp to Buy,externalmortgage scheme (which ended in December) Why buy a property? We were sick of living at home with each of our parents and wanted our own space. I'd rather live in a house than just a bedroom. We discussed moving out and renting, but we both agreed it was dead money. How did you do it? There was a lot of budgeting. I literally know where every penny goes. I had to drill it into Laura a little bit, but she got used to it after a while. Like her make-up - she had to go for a cheaper brand. We were both working at McDonald's when we were saving and if there were extra shifts, we would take them. Mark and Laura say they had to change their lifestyle in order to save money to buy their home Did you make any sacrifices? There was definitely a lifestyle change when we were saving. We would buy supermarket budget stuff instead of brands. We didn't go on holiday during the time we were saving up - and that was a massive thing for Laura. How does it feel to be a home owner? I feel ridiculously happy. I feel proud and our friends are too because they know we worked extremely hard for it. Once you get there, you don't need to worry as much. What if you need to move? I recently went for a job in Bolton, which is not that close to where we are now. The salary was Â£27,000 per year, but I wouldn't move house for that. It would have to be significantly higher to consider jobs away from where we are now. Mark says you need to watch your money if you want to save up to buy a home Reaction from friends? I can't count how many times our friends have asked us how we've done it. We just explain you need to save, watch your money and cut back. They're happy for us and we are just trying to get it into them not to leave it too long and to start saving. Should more young people be able to buy a home? I have got mixed opinions. When Laura and I were at McDonald's we were on a combined salary of Â£23,000 and we managed to save up Â£7,000 between us within a year. So I don't see how people can't do it. But then we don't have any kids. The Help to Buy mortgage scheme was a God-send. But if you're stopping something that's so good and helping young people, it's going to cause mayhem. Name:Ruby Willard, age 22. A recruitment consultant on Â£19,000 a year plus commission Lives with:Partner Sam, age 22. An engineer Location:Havant, Hampshire House price:Â£182,200 for a two-bedroom terraced house Deposit:Â£18,220 (10%) with theHelp to Buy Isa,external Why buy a property? It was a case of living at home. I moved back into the box room of my mum's house and I hated it. Sam lived with his parents too so we thought if we can, let's do it - so we decided to save and go for it. We were looking at renting but to us it was like throwing away money. How did you do it? Being quite tight is probably the answer. When we decided we were going to buy, I thought I'm not going to spend money elsewhere when I don't need to. We did still have a nice holiday to Greece. I get commission and Sam gets overtime so we probably earn Â£55,000 overall, which meant we were in a position we could borrow maybe more than people on minimum wage. Did you make any sacrifices? We may have not had such a big social life. We still did things, but we were conscious. What I did was save what I knew I needed to save, and lived on whatever I had left - which was usually about Â£200 a month. I wasn't buying lunch at work, which would save about Â£25 a week. How does it feel to be a home owner? It was weird at first. When we got the keys it was like ""are we on holiday?"" When things started to come together it felt like such an achievement. Everything we had chosen not to do, not going to the cinema one night, helped towards it. What if you need to move? We would be open to the idea, but we would probably look for work closer to where we bought a house, so it probably would affect future decisions. If we did decide we wanted to go somewhere else, we would probably look to sell the house and hopefully we will have made some money on it. Reaction from friends? It's been quite positive. I have got friends that have bought houses, but a lot of them have had big lump sums of money given to them. Should more young people be able to buy a home? Neither of us completed three years at university, so we probably established a career path earlier than those that do go. I speak to a lot of people that have graduated, and they cannot find jobs that will allow them to borrow enough. It takes years to save a deposit, and then house prices go up and they can't borrow enough. I think this is how it is now. You might also like... Skip your avocado brunch - and buy a house? Vent your rent: The campaign laying bare the insides of London homes How to get a Â£20,000 pension by the time you retire Ministers admit the housing system is broken The couple have been told they are ""adulting hard"" because they have bought a home Name:Andrew Douglas, age 23. A social worker on Â£31,000 a year Lives with:Partner Kirsty Lamb, age 24. A pharmacist on Â£35,000 a year Location:Moredun, Edinburgh. House price:Â£145,000 for a two-storey terraced house with two bedrooms Deposit:Â£21,750 (15%) with the Help to Buy Isa Why buy a property? We decided we wanted to get on the property ladder as quickly as possible. If we get on it now, we would be able to buy what we want by the time we are older and looking to have a family. How did you do it? We started saving at the beginning of 2015 and were probably saving between Â£400 and Â£500 a month each. We did go on a couple of holidays, so although we've been saving, we've still been living. We weren't scrimping, but we do only spend about Â£30 a week on food. We check receipts and look for the best deals, so that is more thrifty than most people. Andrew and his partner saved around Â£400 a month each for their deposit Did you make any sacrifices? We spoke about going away for three weeks to somewhere like Australia, but we thought - it's going to cost Â£2,000 each and we can put that towards the house now rather than waiting a few extra months. How does it feel to be a home owner? It feels strange. It does feel like quite a lot of responsibility - I didn't realise how much. Things like taking out mortgage protection. Our friends call it ""adulting hard"". They're renting and not really thinking about owning a place and they're like ""wow, you've bought a house"". Reaction from friends? Lots of people think it's really good, other people say they're nowhere near that stage. I don't know if they're thinking I'm growing up too fast. It's generally been positive.  I don't know anyone who has done it without a partner, so I think it would be difficult to do it on your own. Andrew and Kirsty bought their home with a 15% deposit What if you need to move? With a big move we might give it a trial, and rent out this house while we lived somewhere else. Should more young people be able to buy a home? I do think people complain they can't afford to buy a house but they go out every weekend, they smoke or they eat out all the time. But property prices have also shot up in the last 20 years with more people buying second homes. There are also people who don't want to have the responsibility. I think it's good that the government is helping with Help to Buy schemes and it needs to do more to help first-time buyers.

We lived in a rental flat together for 18 months and realised that the amount we were paying in rent was more or less the same as we would be paying with a mortgage. When we were renting there were a lot of things we couldn't do, like decorate or move anything around. How did you do it? It was difficult. I was working part-time in my final year at university so I saved my entire wage and lived off my student loan, which wasn't much. We didn't go on holiday that year and saved as much as we could. Their home cost Â£126,500 with a 5% deposit Did you make any sacrifices? We came straight from university, where you're living on a bit of a shoe-string anyway, so we probably sacrificed but not realised, because we've not been enjoying the extra income we've had since graduating. We would have probably gone on some more holidays or gone out more and probably bought a few more clothes. How does it feel to be a home owner? It's brilliant. I feel it's a really secure base while I'm going on to develop my career. It's one less thing. A lot of people are aiming towards saving a deposit while I've got past it. What if you need to move? It would be really difficult, and it's definitely an attraction for staying where I am. In my career there are a lot of opportunities down south, but I wouldn't want to entertain it because of the house prices. It would take us five times longer to save up a deposit, and the amount of income you need to get for a mortgage is totally unobtainable for the average graduate. Rebecca says there needs to be more affordable housing Reaction from friends? Some live in a more expensive area and I think they were surprised. It's not something that's on a lot of people's radar, owning a home at this age. Particularly if you're not in a relationship, I don't think it is affordable. Should more young people be able to buy a home? I think cultures have changed a bit. When my parents were growing up, their parents drilled into them 'sort yourself a house, get married and that's when your life begins'. Now there's not as much of an emphasis.  I think homes do need to be more affordable. It's silly that the town where we live in, a lot people can afford to buy - whereas only as far south as Birmingham no-one can afford to buy a house earning what we do. The average age of a first-time buyer in the UK is 30,says lender Halifax The deposit paid by first-time buyers was on average more than 20% of the property price in 2014 The cost of a home for a first-time buyer was 4.5 times their annual income in 2014 The median income for a first-time buyer household in England was Â£43,000 in 2014/15 - Â£16,000 more than all households Nearly a third had help from friends and family for their deposit The average price of a UK home was Â£217,928 in November 2016 - 6.7% higher than the previous year Source:ONS,external,Department for Communities and Local Government,external,Land Registry,external Where can I afford to live?,external Home ownership among 25-year-olds slumps First-time buyers 'need more help' 'Best places' for first-time buyers Help to Buy Department for Communities and Local Government Keir Starmer and Kemi Badenoch clash over a national inquiry into grooming gangs Thousands flee three LA wildfires as forecasters warn worst is yet to come Inside neighbourhood totally lost in LA fires How Canada's immigration debate soured - and helped seal Trudeau's fate 'I can't get divorced as I can't get my pension valued' BBC Sound of 2025: Barry Can't Swim is a new dance music superstar Ros Atkins on...Elon Musk's political interventions A journalist's murder highlights risks of reporting in small-town India Jean-Marie Le Pen - founder of French far right and 'Devil of the Republic' Cases of HMPV are on the rise in China - but what is it?

"This video can not be played Barack Obama is on holiday learning to kitesurf with Richard Branson Whether after four years or eight, all US presidents must eventually confront the question: What happens when I leave the Oval Office? For Barack Obama, the answer was a five-star Caribbean holiday - and a seemingly endless grin. The former commander in chief has been pictured beaming on a beach in a backwards cap, flanked by an equally cheery Michelle. The venue for this masterclass in chilling? Moskito island in the British Virgin Islands, owned by British billionaire Sir Richard Branson. Sir Richardposted pictures on his blog,externalof Mr Obama learning to kite-surf, and engaging in a play-fight with the businessman. Barack Obama has been enjoying his newfound freedom on Sir Richard Branson's private island The airline mogul said he invited the Obamas ""for a complete break"" on his private island after they left the White House. Not every president wants a sunshine stay after the West Wing doors swing shut, however. So which leaders picked elephant hunting, marrying a relative, and a sideline in oil painting...? When the 43rd president left office in January 2009, he ditched Washington for a quiet life between a house in Dallas, Texas, and his 1,500-acre Prairie Chapel Ranch. Keen to enjoy his retirement, the sexagenarian took weekly painting lessons. His subjects included Russian President Vladimir Putin, Tony Blair, and the Dalai Lama - as well as his pets. His inspiration was his great hero Sir Winston Churchill, who turned to art in his forties as a refuge from the tumult of politics. George W Bush paintings go on display Obama asks: What shall I do now? Spotify's job offer for Barack Obama ""When I get to heaven I mean to spend a considerable portion of my first million years in painting, and so get to the bottom of the subject,"" the wartime leader reportedly said. Mr Bush was less patient, telling his art teacher: ""There is a Rembrandt trapped in this body. And your job is to find it."" This video can not be played George W Bush said he could only paint these portraits because he got know the leaders so intimately Despite being nicknamed 'Teddy' and famously refusing to shoot a bear, the 26th president took a year-long African hunting trip with his son, Kermit, in 1909. The duo were accompanied by more than 200 porters, and scientists from the Smithsonian Institution. They made their way round Africa dispatching over 11,000 animals - including elephants, rhinos, hippos, snakes, zebra, and monkeys among others - before shipping the carcasses home for scientific study. Another exotic trip followed for Mr Roosevelt (and Kermit) in late 1913, when they joined Brazil's most famous explorer Candido Rondon to chart the course of the River of Doubt. The 760km (472 mile) stretch was ultimately renamed Roosevelt River in his honour. Theodore Roosevelt visited Africa and South America when his presidency was over The aforementioned Teddy Roosevelt had no time for Benjamin Harrison, president from 1889-93, branding him ""a cold-blooded, narrow-minded, prejudiced, obstinate, timid old psalm-singing Indianapolis politician"". But none of that stopped the 23rd president from wedding a woman 25 years his junior, who also happened to be his niece by marriage. Mr Harrison's first wife, Caroline, had died of tuberculosis in 1892. When he wed Mary Dimmick four years later, his two adult children refused to attend the ceremony. Benjamin Harrison, the 23rd US president, married his widowed niece America's first president lived only two years after leaving the job - and spent them making whiskey. In 1799, the year of his death, his distillery in Mount Vernon, Virginia, produced nearly 11,000 gallons - making it the largest in the US at the time. Also a livestock farmer, the founding father used leftovers from the whiskey-making to fatten his pigs. As for the distillery - it's still going, selling its golden product to tourists at the Mount Vernon Estate and museum.

"Donald Trump is, by sheer force of character, destroying the mainstream media as we know it. His relentless barrage of abuse, not least about ""fake news"", has fatally undermined the trust of the American people in their traditional sources of news; and by denying the Washington press corps access to his administration, he has neutralised a key weapon in the armoury of political journalism. Meanwhile, his use of social media, talk radio and favoured alt-right websites has allowed him to communicate directly to voters, rendering journalists an irrelevant distraction. Andthe Spicer Doctrine- the belief held by the White House press secretary that it is the job of government to hold media to account and not just the other way round - poses a mortal threat to the trade we call reporting. Any combination of the above paragraphs could appear, without much contention, in almost every appraisal of Trump's relationship with the media that I have read in the past year. That it has limited basis in reality, and indeed is contradicted by the vast bulk of available evidence, has been no impediment to its ubiquity. In fact, contrary to the prevailing orthodoxy, Donald Trump is not the man who will kill the mainstream media. He is the man who could save it. Mark Thompson, of the New York Times Company, has seen revenues rise Together with Dominic Hurst, a brilliant producer, I have been looking at Mr Trump's relationship with the media for Radio 4's PM programme. The evidence is emphatic: Trump has given many news organisations the sustainable commercial future they so desperately crave. The New York Times, one of Mr Trump's favourite voodoo dolls,which he has repeatedly admonished on Twitter,externaland in rallies, is doing very well out of the new president. In the three weeks after his election, it sold132,000 digital subscriptions,external- a tenfold increase. That's a lot of revenue with which to fund serious journalism. I spoke to Mark Thompson, the paper's chief executive and a former director general of the BBC. He told me that the president's actions and words ""are causing hundreds of thousands of Americans who've never paid for news before to pay for it for the first time"". And he added: ""It's not a political point, it's purely a commercial point: the Trump era seems to be a very good era for quality journalism."" CNN, the other organisation that Mr Trump has repeatedly labelled as fake news, also has plenty to thank the president for. Thanks to him, 2016 was CNN'smost watched year,external. As for news websites like BuzzFeed News, the Guardian, Mail Online, the Independent and others, Trump has generated phenomenal traffic - which in turn boosts revenues. Two points about Mr Trump's benefit to the mainstream media strike me. The first is that it applies to different platforms and different business models. 2016 brought more viewers than ever to CNN The New York Times is a newspaper and website with a semi-permeable paywall - the so-called free premium, or freemium model. The Independent has a low cost base and is funded by a huge range of advertising revenue streams. CNN is a cable news network. All are thriving just now. Second, Mr Trump has doubtless fortified the differences between the commercial and editorial departments of outlets such as these three. Take the New York Times. Columnists and leader writers on that gloriously high-minded body, the editorial board, are writing about how awful Mr Trump is, a threat to the republic, an American Putin, these are the end days, and so forth. Meanwhile, Mark Thompson is rubbing his hands with glee - not necessarily at the policies of the president, but at the ambient glow of his bottom line. Throughout my journalistic career, there have been serious questions about how journalism is funded. There is no one or easy answer to that. But based on the evidence above, a very good answer has two words - ""Donald"", and ""Trump"". This brash reality TV star has caused no end of discomfort for the mainstream media. But perhaps what should really make them squirm in their lofty op-ed conferences is the fact that he is doing more than any other modern politician to help them pay their mortgages and feed their families.

"Over the last three decades, governments of various stripes have promised radical change to solve England's housing crisis and today'sWhite Paper,externalis no exception. The problem is that so many of the initiatives and ideas sold to the country as ground-breaking prove to be business as usual. So the Communities Secretary Sajid Javid went out of his way to sound no-nonsense and tough today. He accused some English councils of ""fudging"" the numbers on housing need in their area and warned them that he was not going to allow that to happen anymore. But the response to the government's proposals has been decidedly mixed. Labour's shadow housing minister John Healey described them as ""feeble beyond belief"". ""Re-treading old ground"" was how the National Association of Commercial Finance Brokers described the White Paper.  ""Kicking the can down the road,"" one big investment fund said. The chief executive of the housebuilder Inland Homes, Stephen Wicks, bemoaned the failure to relax rules on green belt development. ""Brownfield in itself can't possibly sustain the long-term housing requirements of the UK,"" he said.  ""It can go an awful long way but there needs to be a relaxation of some green belt to enable us to deliver the numbers that we are required to do."" The White Paper does include measures to encourage developers, housing associations and councils to build more affordable homes more quickly, both to rent and to buy. But this government seems to speak with two voices on housing: the communities department wants to shift the balance of power firmly towards new development in places people want to live, but Number 10 and some influential Tory backbenchers are sympathetic to the passionate concerns of those who wish to protect the countryside and particularly the green belt. The real question that lies behind all the rhetoric and policy bullet-points is whether the balance of power between development and local opposition has fundamentally changed. Ministers now accept England needs 250,000 new homes every year, they have described the housing market as ""broken"" and they agree that radical change is the only way to mend it. But many have yet to be convinced that this White Paper amounts to a ""realistic plan"" to achieve that.

"Philip Hammond knows all about the government's attempts to ""get the public finances in order"" following the financial crisis of 2008. He was the man, as shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, credited by many for the tough detail of the austerity plan laid before voters in the run up to the 2010 election. George Osborne was the architect, Mr Hammond the foreman, ensuring there was a plan that might actually have a chance of working, public sector cut by public sector cut. Now Mr Hammond is the man in charge of the public finances - his dream government job and, a relatively rare occurrence for the resident of Number 11, said authoritatively to be the high water mark of his ambitions. Whatever his relations with the Prime Minister, and they are better than often reported, the fact that he doesn't want to move his sofas next door is a useful salve to any scratchiness between Downing Street's most important neighbours. Mr Hammond expected to take a ""steady-as-she-goes"" approach to his first Budget Today sees the publication of the Institute for Fiscal Studies' (IFS) annual Green Budget, its analysis of Mr Hammond's room for manoeuvre as he prepares for the real Budget, on 8 March. There is one clear message. If you thought the era of cuts is over, think again. Day-to-day spending, officially known rather more prosaically as the Resource Departmental Expenditure Limit (which excludes investment spending), is set to fall by 4% over the next three years. The IFS says that a ""particularly sharp cut"" has been loaded onto the last year of the parliament, 2019-20, never a particularly comfortable time for a government to be squeezing the public sector pips even more aggressively. Alongside that, the IFS says the overall tax burden is set to rise as a proportion of national income to the highest level since 1986. That is not a function of actual tax rises - taxes for many millions of people have fallen as income tax thresholds have risen - but a function of a relatively high tax take throughout an era of pretty stagnant growth. Will Mr Hammond change course on 8 March, and further loosen the government's austerity strictures as he did in the Autumn Statement last year - pushing the deficit reduction target into the conveniently indistinct long grass of ""during the next parliament""? The government has, after all, promised an economy that works for all. I am told not - and that Mr Hammond is approaching his first Budget as a ""steady-as-she-goes affair"" with no major yanks on the national rudder, particularly given the economy's robust performance since the Brexit referendum. Servicing the UK's debt costs about Â£34bn a year It has been pointed out to me that, just ahead of the triggering of Article 50 - the official mechanism for leaving the European Union - the last thing Britain needs is a reset of fiscal policy. In 2010, the Conservatives were elected as the party that would bring public income and public expenditure into balance. Mr Hammond still cleaves to that view. ""He is a Conservative,"" as one official close to him says. George Osborne's economic approach is alive and well. Yes, there are criticisms by some economists that there is no need to run a country like a household budget where pennies in and pennies out matter - governments are able to borrow at very cheap rates on the international markets and put that money to economically valuable use. Yes, there are criticisms that debt costs as a percentage of national income are low by historic standards and so the room for manoeuvre is rather greater than the national debt headline figures suggest. But those close to Mr Hammond argue that, OK, borrowing may be cheap now but servicing Britain's Â£1.7 trillion debt is still expensive, costing around Â£34bn a year, or 4.6% of all government spending. Cut out the deficit and start dealing with the debt and those costs can be brought down. Certainly, since the referendum, the cost of government debt has increased as rising inflation risk pushes up yields - the interest rate on government bonds issued to investors. Mr Hammond is briefing the Cabinet for the first time this week on the broad parameters of next month's Budget. He will talk about Britain's historic productivity problem and how to solve it, he will talk about skills, he will talk about research and development support and he will talk about infrastructure spending. Supporting the private economy is his priority, not reversing public sector cuts. Mr Hammond will also say that the new world of work - the gig economy - is affecting the way the Treasury has to approach complicated issues such as tax receipts as the number of self-employed - who tend to pay a lower proportion of their income to the state - grows. A lot of it will be rhetoric at this stage. For Mr Hammond wants to keep his powder dry. Dry for the bigger fiscal event of the year, the autumn Budget (as we should now call it) in November or December. As he said last year, he only wants one major tax and spend ""moment"" a year. And it's not going to be next month.

"This video can not be played The Ocado warehouse run by robots There is growing concern about the impact of automation on employment - or in crude terms - the threat that robots will eat our jobs. But if you want to see how important robotics and artificial intelligence can be to a business Ocado is a good place to start. ""Without it we simply couldn't do what we do at this scale,"" the online retailer's chief technology officer Paul Clarke told me. With margins in the supermarket business wafer thin, continually bearing down on costs and waste has been vital. At its Hatfield distribution centre I got a glimpse of how far the process of automating the sorting of thousands of grocery orders has come. For now, you will struggle to spot a robot - unless you count a machine that inserts plastic shopping bags into crates - but software is doing a very complex job of sending the right goods in the right crates to the right human pickers. Roboticists at Ocado are working on a robotic hand, gentle enough to pick up fruit ""This warehouse is crammed with machine learning and algorithms that are controlling all manner of operations that are invisible to the human eye,"" Mr Clarke explains. But in one corner of the warehouse is the robotics lab where the next stage of automating Ocado is under way. A group of some of the smartest robotic engineers from across Europe are at work on their latest project which could replace human pickers one day. It's a robotic hand sensitive enough to pick up a piece of fruit without damaging it. ""The overall challenge is to develop robotic systems that can pick and pack the full range of items,"" explains head of robotics Alex Harvey. The robot warehouse contains crates containing various goods which the robots select The robot hand won't be ready to start work for a while but at Ocado's newest warehouse in Andover, Hampshire, a robotics project that the company believes is unequalled in its sophistication has already been deployed. Swarms of robots move across a grid, collaborating with each other to collect groceries stored beneath them and then bring them to a human picker. Showing me some video of the warehouse, Paul Clarke explains the technical challenge: ""Controlling thousands of robots in real time has required not only building a very sophisticated AI-based air traffic control system but also we've had to evolve a new communications systems to talk to all those robots 10 times a second."" But seeing all those swarming robots with not a human in sight sparks an obvious thought - what about the impact on jobs? Ocado says despite the onward march of automation its workforce has continued to grow. ""We have no choice both as a company and as UK PLC but to invest in this technology,"" says Mr Clarke.""We are a net employer of 12,000 people, none of whom would have a job at all if it weren't for our use of automation because this has been our differentiator as a business."" Economists disagree on the scale of the threat to employment. An Oxford study which predicted that more than 40% of occupations could be threatened by automation over the next two decades is now seen by many as far too pessimistic. Will human jobs change as robots take on some of the roles we currently fill? That is certainly the view of Laura Gardiner, of the Resolution Foundation, who points out that jobs are becoming more multi-faceted, so that even if one task is taken by a robot, there will still be others left for the humans. But she does accept that for certain categories of worker life may get harder: ""It is right to be concerned about specific occupations - secretarial work, processing jobs in factories - moderately skilled jobs which used to pay quite well."" What is clear is that in an evolving job market, some skills will become redundant, while others will be in higher demand. And the best advice? Train as a robotics engineer.

"The claim:The green belt is safe from an increase in development. Reality Check verdict:The rules for developing green belt previously said that it was allowed only in exceptional circumstances. The government has now specified what would count as exceptional circumstances. It is not clear whether the new rules will be more or less strict than just letting councils decide what counted as exceptional circumstances. The government has described the housing market as broken, promised more affordable homes and said it would help people to buy and rent. A big question in discussions of increasing the supply of homes is whether planning regulations will be changed to make it easier to build on green belt land. Green belts were introduced after World War Two to stop cities from sprawling and countryside being spoilt. About 13% of England is now covered. This covers scenic sites open to the public, such as the Chiltern Hills and North Downs, but it also covers a lot of land that has limited public access and may not be particularly beautiful. In the House of Commons, Communities Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""In 2015, we promised the British people that the green belt was safe in our hands and that is still the case."" So what has changed? There has been little variation in the amount of green belt land since 1997, although data is not available for every year. The Housing White Paper,externalsays the current planning regulations allow building on the green belt only ""in exceptional circumstances"" but that there is no detail given of what would amount to exceptional circumstances. The government has now specified that before allowing development on green belt land, councils would need to rule out options including: using brown field sites or estate regeneration using land that is currently underused, including surplus public sector land other authorities helping to provide land for development The White Paper also says that councils allowing the boundaries of green belt land to be changed would have to make up for it by improving other bits of green belt.

"If BP group chief executive Bob Dudley was paid Â£14m for delivering a $6.5bn (Â£5.3bn)* loss last year, what on earth will he get paid for delivering a profit in 2017? The answer to this will shed a lot of light on the politically current and intense debate around executive pay. A year ago, Mr Dudley became the unwilling poster boy for angry shareholders when, at the BP annual general meeting, 59% of shareholders voted against his Â£14m pay award. He got the money anyway because the vote was not binding, so the board did not have to do what the owners of the company wanted. Under rules introduced by the coalition government and championed by then Business Secretary Vince Cable, shareholders can only reject a pay packet or the formula by which it is calculated every three years. That measure gave them more control than they had previously enjoyed but it clearly did not work or go far enough. Remember, the formula by which Mr Dudley's pay was calculated in 2016 was approved by 95% of shareholders in 2014. Two years later they did not like the answer that formula spat out. In defence of Mr Dudley, it was not his fault that BP's Deepwater Horizon platform exploded in 2010 killing 11 people and pumping millions of barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico (that was on the watch of his predecessor Tony Hayward). The explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig led to an environmental disaster It was not his fault that the price of oil in 2015 came crashing down from more than $100 (Â£81) a barrel to around $30 (Â£24) during that year. Given the hand he was dealt, goes the argument, he did a pretty good job. Some of the arguments will be the same this year. It is not his fault that he had to put another $7bn (Â£5.7bn) in the Deepwater kitty, but it is also not to his credit that the oil price rebounded to its current price of $56 (Â£45). The chairman of BP's pay committee, Dame Ann Dowling, came in for a lot of stick for not using more discretion in adjusting the final pay award down last year and I understand that she has met with dozens of shareholder groups to avoid the same howls of protest this time around. This April's vote on 2016 pay will also be non-binding but there will be a binding vote on the formula used to calculate pay packets for the next three years. It would take a particularly tin ear for BP to settle on a formula that finds it at such odds with its shareholders in the future. Many executives are rewarded with a formula that takes a large account of relative performance. Doing badly - but less badly than the competition - means you did well. Even though the company lost money - you can often take home a hefty bonus. The merits of this approach will be hotly debated this year as around half the companies in the FTSE 100 have binding votes on executive pay formulas. That will add real edge to a debate that has already been politically sharpened by Theresa May's warnings to corporate Britain over the rocketing disparity between bosses and workers' pay. We are expecting new proposals on changing the manner, and in whose interests, UK companies are run when the government publishes its green paper on corporate governance in March. I have presented the economic arguments as towhy high performance-related pay is actually bad for companies and the economy here before.In short, it can prioritise cost cutting over investment which damages productivity and ultimately living standards. They are arguments that are gaining currency in Whitehall and it is not only shareholders who are disgruntled. It may be only February, but this year's shareholder spring promises to be a belter. *the headline loss of $6.5bn includes the compensation paid for the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.

"Kylie Minogue has released fragrances, furniture and clothes with her trademarks on them A trademark battle between Kylie Minogue and Kylie Jenner appears to have come to an end. Jenner, who first shot to fame in the US reality TV show Keeping Up With the Kardashians, has been trying to trademark the name Kylie in the US. But she has been blocked by the veteran Australian pop star Minogue, best known for hits such as I Should Be So Lucky and Can't Get You Out Of My Head. After a long and heated battle, the Kylies may have reached a settlement. According to papers filed with the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), in April 2015 Jenner attempted to register the mark ""KYLIE"" in the US for ""advertising services"" and ""endorsement services"". Ms Jenner is the younger half-sister of Kim Kardashian In response, Minogue's teamfiled their opposition,externalin February 2016, citing possible confusion and ""damage"" to  Minogue's branding. They noted Minogue was an ""internationally renowned performing artist, humanitarian and breast cancer activist"" who already owns Kylie-related trademarks in the US in several industries, as well as the website www.kylie.com. Jenner, on the other hand, was dismissed as a ""secondary reality television personality"" who had drawn criticism for her ""photographic exhibitionism and controversial posts"" on social media. In February 2016 Minogue tweeted this message, shortly after her team filed its opposition The case was suspended at least twice in 2016 for settlement negotiations. On 19 January Minogue's team withdrew its opposition, which means Jenner's application could proceed. This raises the possibility that they agreed to a settlement. The BBC approached both sides, but Jenner's lawyers declined comment, and Minogue's team did not respond. The USPTO does not comment on individual cases. Kylie Jenner, who is known for her full-looking lips, released a range of lip glosses last year But meanwhile Jenner appears to have conclusively lost another battle - to trademark her full name. In November 2015, Jenner's lawyers separatelytried to trademark,externalthe name ""KYLIE JENNER"" for a long list of clothing and accessories. But this was rejected in July last year. On 23 January, Jenner's teamappealed against this decision.,external Flight attendant shares story of saving trafficking victim Why do Germans hate this football club? How to own a home in the UK by the age of 25 Last year, Jenner launched a line of cosmetics called KYLIE. According to her latest appeal, she wants to eventually have ""KYLIE JENNER"" branded clothing as well as loungewear, swimwear, and underwear. Meanwhile, Minogue owns ""KYLIE"" and other similar trademarks in perfumes and toiletries, music and sound recordings, live entertainment, jewellery, dolls and toys, and printed matter such as magazines and books. So far, Minogue has released fragrances, furniture and clothes with her trademarks on them. In 2007 Minogue launched her fragrance line which is registered in the US as Kylie Minogue Darling She also had previously said in interviews she intends to one day produce a musical featuring her greatest hits, and owns the US trademark for ""Lucky: The Kylie Minogue Musical"". But it's more than that. Since the 1980s, Kylie Minogue has never had to go by any other name but Kylie, and her team has argued it's a fundamental part of the pop diva's identity. Even with a possible settlement, what the battle shows is that at the very least brand KYLIE is not won without a fight. Reporting by the BBC's Tessa Wong, Kevin Ponniah and Jay Savage.

"Many children now spend more time online than watching TV Like many parents, I am the unofficial IT manager in my house. And, like many IT managers, my users are never happy with the service they get. The complaints have got louder over the past few months as I have tried to manage how much time two of them (my teenage children) spend online and to restrict what they see. A patchwork of different technologies help me do this. It includes: rules on the router to limit net time apps on tablets to watch content software on PCs to spot malware and filter searches It works, after a fashion, but I know it has holes and that is why I also use a lot of sneakernet. This involves me walking around the house, kicking my kids off the game console, tablet, phone or TV (delete as appropriate) they are using when they should be doing homework, cleaning out the rabbit or getting ready for school. Research suggests I'm not alone in using tech to oversee online time - both to limit it and to help them stay safe. About 44% of parents use apps to oversee online activity, 39% check browser histories and 37% put controls on the router, suggests statistics gathered by security company Symantec. I use all three of those and want to use more. And it looked like technology was going to get even more useful as electronics companies released products with comprehensive parental controls onboard. Talking to children about their online habits can help limit cyber-bullying It's perhaps no surprise that parents are keen to turn to technology to help manage time online, says Nick Shaw, European general manager at security company Norton, because it's one area where they struggle to find help. ""When people have a parenting problem with their children, they might go to their own parents for advice,"" he says, ""but this is the one area where your parents are not as clued up as you are."" And, he says, children are even more clued up and easily capable of running rings around their parents. ""A lot of parents are very naive about this,"" he says. Even I got complacent because none of the tech I had put in place was sending me alerts. I thought it was all working fine and my children were browsing and gaming in an impenetrable bubble of safety. Wrong. Slowly I found out that by fiddling with system clocks, using safe mode and putting home PCs into sleep states, my two teenagers could avoid most of the locks and blocks. My schoolboy error, says Mr Shaw, was to let the hardware do the heavy lifting. ""Technology is going to help you,"" he says, ""but it's not going to get away from the fact that you should be having more conversations about this with your kids."" The parental controls of Norton's futuristic looking Core router are controlled via a smartphone What I should be doing, he says, is helping them to understand why the controls are needed. Explaining the reasons, he says, can help to defuse some of the objections. It is fair to say that my children and I have had some of these conversations. But they have been more of the ""play-less-games-and-do-more-maths"" type rather than the ""anti-virus-stops-your-YouTube-account-being-stolen"" sort. Tony Anscombe, security evangelist at anti-virus company Avast, says talking to children about safe ways to use the web is better than just imposing restrictions. ""Sure,"" he says, ""set some rules about how they should use it, but you should also educate your kids about basic security principles. ""A lot of parents just do not have the conversation, talking to them about what is acceptable and what is not."" This should cover not sharing passwords and thinking before they share personal data such as contact information, images and videos. Naivety puts many children at risk, he says, and it is worth reminding them about what can be done with that information and who might want it. Ofcom suggests UK parents are doing more to protect their children online, but threats remain (stock photo) It might not just fall into the hands of cyber-thieves, he says, it might also expose them to cyber-bullying or just be inappropriate to share. Warnings about the hidden features in popular apps are worth passing on, he says, as they often seek to scoop up more information than they really need. ""The biggest and most important thing that parents can do is run the apps their children do,"" he says. This will help parents understand what information children might share and uncover any hidden features the apps possess. Some, he says, look innocuous but are designed to help children conceal what they are doing. ""Gadgets are only half the story, if that,"" says Dr Sonia Livingstone, from the London School of Economics, who studies how children use the internet, as part of her work with the long-running EU Kids Online project. Companies should concentrate on doing less selling and more on designing services that do not need the protections they peddle, she says. In addition, she says, parents should encourage children to do the right thing by doing it themselves, rather than just by dictating terms. It's about respect too, she says, helping children make good decisions instead of arbitrarily imposing rules. If they can see the benefits of the rules, they are more likely to follow them. ""I am not very keen on the idea that parents have lots of control over their children,"" she says. ""Children have rights too.""

"Former US President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle last visited the Republic of Ireland in 2011 Former US President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle are to be granted the Freedom of the City of Dublin. Dublin City councillors voted to award the honour in recognition of Mr Obama's ""moderating and progressive"" influence on the world stage. They also acknowledged Mrs Obama's work for the education of girls around the world and on behalf of refugees. Lord Mayor Cllr Brendan Carr confirmed the couple had indicated through contacts their happiness to accept. A meeting will be held with US Embassy officials within days and a visit could be organised by the end of the year, he added. He also said the couple saw it as an opportunity for another visit. President Obama and his wife visited the Republic of Ireland in 2011 as part of a tour of Europe. During their stay, the Obamas went to Moneygall, a small village in County Offaly which was home to one of President Obama's ancestors who emigrated to the US in 1850. The motion to grant the honour was carried by 30 votes in favour with 23 against. Cllr Carr, who proposed the motion, told councillors there was precedent for a couple receiving the honour as it was granted to the Crown Prince and Princess of Japan in 1985 for their diplomatic activities. He said Mr Obama had regretted some US actions in the Middle East and the honour was not a ""canonisation"" of the couple. Other international figures to receive the honour include former US President Bill Clinton, former South African President Nelson Mandela and Burmese pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi.

"Albert Morton is looking for someone to carry out the mole catching when he retires An experienced mole catcher is looking for an apprentice willing to take up the traditional trade so he can retire. Albert Morton, 69, from Sowerby Bridge, West Yorkshire, started his business in 1963 and is one of the few remaining mole catchers in the area. Mr Morton said: ""I'd much prefer to get somebody and teach them how to do it, so it carries on."" He said the mechanical spring traps he used were the most humane way of killing the moles. Mr Morton, who works in the areas around Halifax, Sowerby Bridge and Hebden Bridge in Calderdale, said the job would suit someone who liked fresh air. Live updates and more stories from Yorkshire Scientific name is Talpa europaea An industrious digger, it can create about 65ft (20m) of tunnel in a day It feeds mainly on earthworms Has many dialect names including mouldywarp In 1702William III(William of Orange) died days after a fall from a horse caused by a mole hill After the king's death his enemies -Jacobite supporters- would toast ""the little gentleman in the black velvet waistcoat"" He said mole catching was ""just one of those old country crafts and I don't want it to die out"". ""If there was any suffering or cruelty I wouldn't do it."" He has more than 300 customers ranging from farmers to golf course owners. Mr Morton said the job would suit people who like fresh air ""This year it has gone manic but now I'm getting near to my sell-by-date"", he said He started to learn the trade in the 1960s when Mr Morton's father suggested he should help the then mole catcher who was looking to pass his skills on. Mole hills are caused as the mole, which spends most of its time underground, burrows towards the surface and can cause damage to grassed areas. They are particularly prevalent in damp conditions as worms come to the surface and are followed by the moles looking to feed on them.

"This video can not be played The village where Muslims and gays are unwelcome A village in Hungary has banned the wearing of Muslim dress and the call to prayer. By leading what it calls ""the war against Muslim culture"", it hopes to attract other Christian Europeans who object to multiculturalism in their own countries. ""We primarily welcome people from western Europe - people who wouldn't like to live in a multicultural society,"" Laszlo Toroczkai tells theBBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. ""We wouldn't like to attract Muslims to the village."" Mr Toroczkai is mayor of Asotthalom, a remote village in the southern Hungarian plains, situated around two hours from the capital Budapest. ""It's very important for the village to preserve its traditions. If large numbers of Muslims arrived here, they would not be able to integrate into the Christian community. ""We can see large Muslim communities in western Europe that haven't been able to integrate - and we don't want to have the same experience here,"" he says. ""I'd like Europe to belong to Europeans, Asia to belong to Asians and Africa to belong to Africans. Simple as that."" The village of Asotthalom is close to the Hungary-Serbia border The refugee crisis has contributed to a rise in anti-immigrant sentiment across large parts of Europe and Hungary is no exception. At the height of the migrant crisis, as many as 10,000 people crossed the border - just minutes from Asotthalom - from Serbia into Hungary each day. The mayor has capitalised on the anxiety about such an influx and introduced by-laws of questionable legality. The new local legislation bans the wearing of Muslim dress like the hijab and the call to prayer and also outlaws public displays of affection by gay people. Changes are also being brought in to prevent the building of mosques, despite there being only two Muslims living there currently. Many lawyers think the laws contravene the Hungarian constitution and, as part of a general review of new local legislation, the government will rule on them in mid-February. Eniko Undreiner says she felt fearful last year, as migrants crossed the nearby border into Hungary The laws, however, have support among many members of the community. One resident, Eniko Undreiner, said it was ""really scary"" to see ""masses of migrants walking through the village"" last year as they crossed into the country. ""I spend a lot of time at home alone with my young kids - yes, there were times when I was scared,"" she says. The two Muslims living in the village did not want to speak to the BBC for fear of attracting attention to themselves. However, one member of the village said they were ""fully integrated"" within the community. ""They don't provoke anyone. They don't wear the niqab, they don't harass people... I know them personally. We get on just fine."" Migrants enter Hungary in October 2016, at the height of the migrant crisis The mayor hopes the village can be at the forefront of what he calls ""the war against Muslim culture"". He has employed round-the-clock border patrols, which he thinks will attract white Europeans to live there. The Knights Templar International has been advertising homes in Asotthalom on its Facebook page. Its members include Nick Griffin, former leader of the British National Party, and the party's former treasurer Jim Dowson. ""I have been contacted by Jim Dowson,"" Mr Toroczkai explains. ""He came to Asotthalom a few times as a private individual, just to have a look. Nick Griffin also came with him."" Mr Griffin has previously described Hungary as ""a place to get away from the hell that is about to break loose in western Europe"". ""When it all goes terribly wrong in the West, more will move to Hungary and Hungary needs those people."" We have asked Knights Templar International and Nick Griffin for an interview, but neither responded. Mayor Laszlo Toroczkai says Muslims ""would not be able to integrate"" into the village's Christian community Mr Toroczkai says he would be happy to welcome people from England. Asked if he is trying to establish a white supremacist village, Mr Toroczkai replies: ""I didn't use the word white. But because we are a white, European, Christian population, we want to stay [like] this. ""If we were black we'd want to stay a black village. ""But this is a fact and we want to preserve this fact."" TheVictoria Derbyshire programmeis broadcast on weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News channel.

"This video can not be played ""I just think it's got massive amounts of potential,"" says Isabel Ettedgui ""I know I've got to do this. It must be a sickness!"" says Isabel Ettedgui, laughing. It is June 2016, in Mayfair in central London, and she is standing in the middle of a building site. An early 18th Century house is being renovated, ready to be the home of Mrs Ettedgui's latest venture. She is attempting to relaunch a venerable luxury brand: Connolly, a name famous for its leather for over a century. ""I've known this brand for 30-odd years - I still really believe in it. It's got massive amounts of potential,"" she says. Starting any kind of enterprise is challenging, with many businesses failing within their first few years, and relaunching one can be just as hard. ""Reviving a brand that's been silent for a number of years is very difficult indeed,"" says consultant and author Peter York. People actually like to see the owner in a luxury brand store, says Isabel Ettedgui So what's the best way to go about it? Heritage is one factor that certainly seems to be on Mrs Ettedgui's side. Look at the websites of many luxury names, and it is clear that history and tradition are some of the factors that brands are most keen to stress. These are attributes that Connolly has in abundance. The firm, which was family-run for much of its history, began producing leather in the late 19th Century. It soon won favour with a huge range of clients. W Heath Robinson was commissioned to produce illustrations to mark Connolly's 50th anniversary Its leather could be found on the seats of many luxury car marques (including Rolls-Royce), at the Houses of Parliament, on ocean liners such as the Queen Mary, and on supersonic plane Concorde. ""You haven't lived until you have sat your naked butt on Connolly leather,"" actress Joan Collins is reported to have said. In the 1920s, the company asked W Heath Robinson to produce some illustrations to mark its 50th anniversary. The artist, well-known for his drawings of outlandish devices, was astonished by what he found at the factory in Wimbledon. ""I can't improve on that, Mr Connolly,"" was his response to one of the firm's remarkable leather-measuring machines. Decades later, after doing some corporate identity work for the firm, Ms Ettedgui helped the enterprise with a move into retail. ""I just thought, 'this is fantasticâ¦they don't realise what they've got,'"" she remembers. Isabel Ettedgui credits her husband Joseph, famous for building the eponymous fashion chain, for showing her the potential of Connolly The first store opened in 1995, in a mews close to the Lanesborough Hotel in London. Several years later, Mrs Ettedgui's husband Joseph was offered the retail arm of the business, because the Connolly family had decided to concentrate on the motor trade. Joseph Ettedgui had extensive experience of fashion retailing, having built up the Joseph chain of high-end fashion stores, which had branches across the UK. He and Isabel nurtured the retail side of Connolly, opening a bigger store in Conduit Street in Mayfair. ""Joseph brought in clothes,"" Mrs Ettedgui recalls. ""It taught me that Connolly wasn't just a brand of briefcases, it had potential to be a fashion brand as well."" But in the 2000s, Connolly faltered. The family's leather finishing business experienced an unsuccessful expansion into the US. And in 2010, Joseph Ettedgui died. ""After Joe died, I kept renewing these trademarks and thinking what am I going to do?"" says Mrs Ettedgui. She decided to put everything on hold. Connolly was well-known for making the leather seats for many luxury cars, including Ferrari A few years later, she began to get the enterprise going once more. She licensed Jonathan Connolly (a fourth generation member of the family) to start producing leather again, while she began to look for a suitable retail location. Her search led her to a Georgian house just off London's Savile Row. ""It was a little freehold building, which is really rare, and I decided to sell my flat, put everything I could into it and try and launch it without any external backers,"" she says. The house includes several floors of retail space, plus an apartment where Mrs Ettedgui now lives. The new Connolly shop opened in late 2016 For her, this is an essential part of the story. ""There's a desperate need for a different narrative in luxury,"" she says. ""Too many brands are being run in silos by men in suits - what people actually like is to see the owner. ""It's like when you go to a restaurant and the chef [appears] - it's such a joy, you feel connected."" As well as emphasising a personal touch, Mrs Ettedgui has broadened the range of items on sale. In addition to leather goods and clothes, there will be furniture too. ""Beautiful objects, beautiful clothes, well-designed pieces of furniture - it just goes together,"" she says. Reviving a brand, as Mrs Ettedgui is attempting to do, is a tricky thing to pull off. The shop stocks clothing and furniture as well as leather goods ""The things to think about are: how to explain what happened, because people are suspicious of a relaunch. [You need to] say very clearly what it is you're about and reconcile that with the previous back story,"" says Mr York. Mrs Ettedgui is conscious of the challenges she faces - but she is cautiously optimistic. After a hectic period of building and renovation, and working around the clock to get everything ready, the store opened in late 2016. Soon afterwards, a customer came in and showed Mrs Ettedgui a Connolly wallet that he had bought 20 years ago. ""He was really happy that we were back,"" she says. To succeed, she believes, ""you need a dream - you need an obsession really. And you need to believe in something that means you can't not do it.""

"This video can not be played Donald Trump: ""All over Europe it's happening. It's gotten to a point where [attacks are] not even being reported."" US President Donald Trump has accused the media of under-reporting terror attacks, and produced a list to back up his claim. Is he right? While on a visit to US Central Command, a wing of the Department of Defense, he warned of the danger posed by the Islamic State group. ""You have seen what happened in Paris and Nice. All over Europe it's happening,"" he said. ""It's gotten to a point where it's not even being reported. And in many cases the very, very dishonest press doesn't want to report it. ""They have their reasons, and you understand that."" Later in the day, the White House published a list of attacks ""executed or inspired"" by IS. Before the list was published, press secretary Sean Spicer said there were ""several instances"" of attacks that had not gained sufficient media coverage (without specifying which fell into that category). We have reproduced the list below, explaining in each case what happened and whether we reported on it. Of the 78 incidents listed by the White House, we did not report only 12 of them - some were so minor they received barely any coverage elsewhere. Just because the BBC covered an attack does not mean that incident was not under-reported, although it is unclear whether Mr Trump was referring to US or global news organisations. And some terrorist incidents do get more coverage than others, a point that has been hotly debated on social media. Most of the atrocities listed by the White House were committed by Islamists, and the killing of nine black worshippers by a self-avowed white supremacist in South Carolina is notably absent. Absent too is the 2016 bombing of a shopping centre in Baghdad that killed some 300 people, and last week's deadly assault on a mosque in Quebec City. What happened: A teenager was shot dead after he stabbed two police officers. He was a ""known terror suspect"" whose passport had been cancelled on security grounds. Did we cover it?Yes.

"""Speaker silences Trump"", is the i's front page headline, while the Times says ministers are questioning whether John Bercow's decision to oppose President Trump addressing Parliament breached impartiality rules. The Daily Telegraph says those close to the Commons speaker believe he's only required to be politically neutral on domestic issues. But a ministerial source tells the paper Mr Bercow's intervention has ""ramifications"" for the ""special relationship"" with the United States. In an editorial,external, the paper says: ""The contents of Mr Bercow's near-hysterical rant about President Donald Trump's planned state visit to Britain are unacceptable. ""So too is the fact that Mr Bercow has grossly exceeded his authority seemingly believing himself entitled to wade deep into British foreign policy by dint of his office and his bottomless self-importance."" The Sun labels Mr Bercow an ""egomaniac"",external, saying he will have ""lapped up the applause from Labour yesterday as he denounced Donald Trump"". ""Indeed John Bercow will bask in the adulation from the president's haters everywhere. That was the point,"" it says. The Guardiandescribes the intervention as ""extraordinary,external"" and it reports that a senior figure in the government has accused Mr Bercow of ""grandstanding"". However, the paper offers a different verdict on Mr Bercow in itscomment pages,external, saying his stance on President Trump was not a ""party political"" point. It was ""a defence of the everyday decencies that underlie democracy"", the paper says. The Daily Mail's front page lead is that part of the UK's foreign aid budget is being offered to help improve care for the elderly in China. The money would come from the Â£1.3bn Prosperity Fund. The government insists it will be used to help poor people in middle income countries, as well as build post-Brexit trading partnerships. However,the Mail says the idea of sending money to China,external- one of the richest states in the world - ""sticks horribly in the craw"". The paper believes foreign aid must be brought home to help pensioners who deserve decent care. It highlights the case of 89-year-old Iris Sibley, who was kept on a hospital ward in Bristol for six months before a care home was found for her. ""Iris and millions like her paid taxes during their working lives expecting decent care in retirement. They deserve nothing less. Now foreign aid must be brought home to Britain to do precisely that,"" the paper's comment says. The Times understands the energy efficiency ratings,externalof televisions, fridges and dishwashers are to be retested ""in an echo of the Volkswagen-emissions scandal"". ""TV makers kept consumers in dark about running costs,"" it says. According to the paper, there are claims that cheating by manufacturers is costing consumers almost Â£10bn a year in higher electricity bills. The paper says Samsung and LG face allegations that technology helped their products to perform better in energy efficiency tests than in the home. The companies deny this but the European Environmental Bureau has commissioned a British laboratory to examine the claims. The Financial Times leads,externalon the fall of French bond prices to their lowest level in 18 months because of fears about the presidential election. The paper reports the markets are concerned a political scandal engulfing Francois Fillon and his family could bolster the chances of victory for the far-right leader, Marine Le Pen. The FT says traders have been on edge after failing to predict Brexit and President Trump's victory - and that investors are steeling themselves for more jolts. Many of the papers continue to report on the leaking of emails between the former England football captain David Beckham and his public relations team. A spokesman has said the emails about his charity work and his response to not receiving a knighthood have been doctored and are deliberately inaccurate. According to the Daily Mirror,external, a cyber security firm has been called in to try to find the ""mastermind"" behind the theft from servers in Portugal. Contact has been made with British police, it says. TheDaily Telegraph reports that Beckham,externalis frustrated by the lack of progress being made and he fears further damaging material may become public. The Sun says the story is in the public interest because the suggestion that the rich and famous can negotiate their way to an award is another""nail in the coffin for the honours system"",external.

"Dr Cope believes new ways of working have been a success A GP practice in Plymouth has reduced the time it takes to get a routine appointment with a doctor from three-to-four weeks to under seven days. The Beacon Medical Group cares for more than 30,000 patients and was formed in 2014 after three practices merged. Dr Jonathan Cope, GP and managing partner at Plympton Health Centre, one of the Beacon practices which has 10 doctors, says, at present, there are 30 unfilled GP posts in Plymouth. Three years ago, his practice was unable to recruit the equivalent of one-and-a-half full-time GPs. ""We made a conscious decision to look elsewhere, to work differently. So we decided to looks at what skills clinical pharmacists, paramedic practitioners and nurse practitioners could offer. We converted that budget to two-and-a-half full-time equivalents."" Patients registered at Plympton who feel they need same-day care from their family doctor call the reception team at the surgery. Depending on the problem, they will then be called back by an advanced paramedic, pharmacist, nurse practitioner - or a doctor. Beacon Medical Group has started to offer new services Dr Cope said: ""Because of the extra capacity, we have freed up the GPs' time. So we are offering more appointments for routine problems, and the waiting times are now shorter."" The advanced paramedic practitioner, Simon Robinson, responds to any emergency medical problems in the practice, as well as doing, on average, four home visits a day. He says he is often called out to see the more complex cases and his daily schedule allows him to spend more time than the GPs with patients. Simon was keen to point out that if he does have any queries he just has to knock on the GPs' door. Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said while paramedics are highly valued and trusted, they have different skills and training. ""GPs are highly trained to take into account the physical, psychological and social factor - this unique skill set cannot be replaced by another healthcare professional, however well meaning the intention is. ""We do not have enough GPs in the NHS - and actually we don't have enough paramedics either. This transference of workload pressures from one area of the health service to another is not going to benefit our patients in the long term."" In an effort to understand the pressures on the Beacon Medical Group, the 100 most frequent attendees were analysed. Dr Cope expected the list to be dominated by frail, elderly patients but instead the typical patient was a 37-year-old woman, often with mental health problems, multiple prescriptions and referrals to hospital. From March, a psychiatrist will do a weekly clinic from the surgery for these patients and provide additional training on mental health care to staff. It is part of a parallel drive to offer specialised new services more commonly found in a hospital setting. Dr Frow has provided specialist dermatology care Dr Helen Frow, a GP with a special interest in dermatology, has provided care to patients registered to the group in the last two years. ""Onward referrals to the hospital have reduced by 85%,"" she said. A similar scheme for musculoskeletal care resulted in 75% fewer secondary care appointments. The model of working with between 30,000 to 50,000 patients in a multi-specialty community provider model is known as a Primary Care Home. There were 14 other sites working to this structure across England in the last year. The National Association of Primary Care is working closely with NHS England to explore how they can continue to expand working in this way. A BMA spokesperson said: ""Many GP practices are increasingly becoming hubs where nurses and other professionals work together to deliver services to patients.

"There is a simple way to make a job more attractive. Attach more money to it. But, of course, that is not really an option for GPs. Average pay - for those that run practices as partners at least - is already in the six figures so there would be an outcry if pay started going up dramatically when the rest of the public sector is being squeezed. Instead, the government in England is trying to tinker around the edges - offering doctors more training opportunities, making it easier to return to the profession after a break and promoting flexible working. There is even the prospect of a ""golden hello"" for new doctors willing to work in the most deprived areas. But the big question is whether this will be enough. General practice - for a variety of reasons - is not as attractive as it once was. The NHS is in the process of increasing the number of training places to boost numbers. However, over one in 10 went unfilled last year. Coupled to that a recent BMA survey showed the pressures on the profession were prompting large numbers to think about escaping. The poll of 15,000 doctors found a third were thinking of retiring in the next five years and one in 10 was considering moving abroad. If this comes true, it will make it very difficult for the government to achieve its desire to boost the workforce by 5,000 doctors, which in turn will make it difficult to secure the seven-day service ministers are aiming for. But in all this debate it is easy to forget the obvious question. Do we really need GPs available seven days a week? It is something British Medical Association GP leader Dr Chaand Nagpaul raised this morning when he suggested the government would be better focussing its attention on ""supporting practices during the day"". The government, however, is adamant there is a need. But from whom? The biggest users of general practice are the elderly and very young. 32,628 GPs in England 5,000more planned for 2020 1 in 3considering retirement in next five years 13%of GP training places went unfilled last year The average patient sees their doctor six times a year, for the over 75s this tops 20 while for the under-fives it is approaching 15 visits. Neither of these groups tend to have trouble being free to see a doctor during normal hours. It is why those that have tried seven-day opening tend to report that demand is very low, particularly on Sundays (although there does seem to be some appetite for late evening opening and Saturday morning clinics but these were already offered in many places before ministers started pushing for this initiative). Instead, seven-day opening for GPs seems to be more focussed at tackling what is perhaps the Achilles heel of the NHS: Where to go when you need immediate care that does not necessarily need the attention A&E. Estimates suggest as many as four in 10 A&E visits could be dealt with elsewhere. But with the jury still out on the 111 non-emergency phone line and many still suspicious about GP out-of-hours providers, the government seems to be turning to general practice to help it out. But is there a risk the government is using a sledgehammer to crack a nut - albeit a tough nut?

"Andrew Foster is the chief executive of Wrightington, Wigan and Leigh NHS Foundation Trust. It is one of the best performing hospital trusts and up until a year ago it was meeting the four-hour A&E target. But that began to change in 2016. Instead of hitting the 95% target for patients to be seen and treated or admitted, performance dropped to 90% and then 85% in the autumn, before it nosedived following Christmas. ""It started from Boxing Day onwards,"" says Mr Foster. ""We had an outbreak of norovirus which closed three wards and led to 75 staff being off sick. Seven care homes had to shut too. ""It meant our performance dropped to around 60%. It was the worst three weeks I've ever known. Cubicles in A&E were full, we had ambulance staff queuing in the corridors and we could not get patients out of hospital. The whole system backed up."" Since mid-January pressures have eased with four-hour performance back above 80%. But Mr Foster is still worried. ""The problem we have is that we are seeing more and more patients coming to A&E who could be seen by a GP and then we are finding it more difficult to discharge patients. There are simply not the places available any more because of the cuts to social care or we are seeing care homes and families themselves saying that the person's care is too complex. They end up staying in hospital."" Simon Walsh is a consultant in an A&E department in a major trauma centre in London. ""This year things have been closer to breaking point than I've ever known it before,"" he says. ""The set of nights I worked in the period before Christmas were the most difficult I remember working in the last 10 years. ""There was just such pressure on the system and as a result the exit block was so sustained that we had patients stuck for hours on end because there weren't any beds available to admit them on to wards. We had in excess of 20 patients at times for the whole night. And it just paralyses the emergency department."" He says patients and their families were understanding, even though they were frustrated. ""The relatives expressed their frustration but it wasn't anger directed at us - they recognised it was factors out of our control."" But he says morale was low among staff. ""I don't think I've ever seen such tired, exhausted people, they were absolutely dead on their feet. ""People try and keep each other up with as high morale as they can but I think people in that period were close to breaking point. ""I wondered if people would actually come back for the next shift after a couple of the nights we did."" Kimberley Gardner is a nurse at a major trauma centre in the East Midlands working in the critical care department, while her partner is also a nurse in the emergency department. She sayscalling the situation in the NHS a humanitarian crisis,as the Red Cross did in January, ""is not hyperbole, it is the reality"". ""It is the worst I've ever known it. ""During the coalition years we heard the term 'black alert' being thrown around, but it would never actually happen, it seemed as likely as a major disaster or terrorist attack - devastating- but highly unlikely. Now it's a weekly and sometimes daily occurrence and the novelty has worn off. ""Daily we get a phone call from an emergency department begging critical care for equipment to monitor patients as all of their resus bays have been 'doubled up' (where they put two patients in one bay) meaning they need two monitors but only have one. They ask us but we have run out also."" She says another issue is not enough trained paramedics or dispatchers for 111, the NHS non-emergency phoneline. ""The amount of people sent in by 111 to be on the safe side, it's a total failure. ""I saw a woman brought in by ambulance after eating a tin of Quality Street and she was vomiting - why would she ring an ambulance but also why did the crew bring her in? Because a lot of the time they are technicians and not trained paramedics so bring them in to be on the safe side."" Julie Orr is the head of clinical services for Milton Keynes University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust. She oversees the flow of patients through the hospital managing the site team, bed managers and discharge team. ""It's been a challenge this winter. I think the main difference has been that it's been sustained pressure. It's been quite relentless rather than periods of a couple of weeks of pressure. ""I've been in the NHS for 30 years and this is probably one of the most sustained, relentlessly pressured winters that I've seen. ""People don't really have time to catch their breath before the next onslaught of pressures."" Julie Orr with her team A former nursing manager, she says all her team are senior clinicians and move around the site ensuring the flow of patients through the hospital. ""We've had some very difficult days, which has meant that not only the site team but the managers on call and the executive on call have been on site for many, many hours into the night to make sure the patients are safe and that the staff are supported."" But she says her teams have coped ""remarkably well"" despite the pressure. ""Obviously it's very difficult. We all want to do the best for our patients and want to get them home wherever possible or on to the next stage of their journey - I think  sometimes there's not an understanding of why that can't happen. My discharge team along with the ward nursing teams spend a lot of time with patients trying to explain why there might be a delay in that happening."" Grainne Siggins is director of adult social care for the London Borough of Newham. ""Our staff and our staff within the NHS have worked incredibly hard this winter, it's been really difficult. But in December working positively with our colleagues we didn't have any delayed transfers (out of hospital) at all due to social care."" She knows from speaking to her local peers within London they are an ""outlier"" to be in this situation. Because of the borough's diverse population and high levels of deprivation and health issues they bring, the team has had to ""proactively plan"" - but she says ""it's becoming increasingly difficult going forward"". She says they have been heavily supported by their clinical commissioning group. ""Councils are currently prioritising adults and children's services above other areas of spending, but that will only go so far and we do feel we are at a tipping point and that's been borne out this winter - it's difficult to see how the whole system will be able to be sustained next year."" And she says the ageing population means assessments are taking much longer. ""People have got much more complex needs, multiple long term conditions, so we've got that added level of complexity. ""We've seen a significant increase in the level of support we then have to provide to people to make sure they can go home safely and that they are appropriately supported."" Dr Olivia Hum has been a GP since 2007. She works in a surgery in Lewes, east Sussex. ""The intensity of the work in 2017 is really bad. We work 10-12 hours a day without a break,"" she says. She says the demand on GPs has increased ""because of the pressure on hospitals"". ""A&E is too crowded which means that people are not diagnosed properly and they come to the GP for the rest of their health problems. They then bounce back to the hospital. ""The local hospital has seen a huge decline in funding, so people are on six to nine-month waiting lists. This has a huge impact on GPs who are dealing with the deteriorating symptoms of people waiting for tests or treatment, including patients who have symptoms of cancer. This waiting also has huge personal impact on patients, it increases their worry and stress."" She adds: ""There is a real crisis in GP staffing. Lots of practices are closing, so patients try to register at the practice next door which has no space. GPs are burning out, they are overworked and many are retiring early. The system is unsustainable now. ""It is just impossible to provide extra appointments in practices. I know GPs with almost twice as many patients as I have and they can only provide care at a very basic level. It is not safe - the brain can't make these decisions properly in less than 10 minutes. In these cases, quality of care and patient safety is compromised.""

"The NHS has come under intense pressure this winter, with record numbers of patients facing long waits in accident and emergency units among other challenges. We asked some of those who have fallen ill, and the families of others, to share their experiences of winter 2016-17. Sue'sfather's life changed dramatically after he fell out of bed while in hospital in December 2016. Bryan, 84, had been admitted to hospital near their house in Cornwall for a hip operation. Sue says she was not told about his fall for several days, eventually she was told he would not walk again and possibly had only six months left to live. ""I am devastated - six weeks ago everything was fine, now this is not the world I imagined I'd be in. ""In December he was walking into town, doing gardening, he loved mechanics and tinkering. ""Now in hospital his mental health has really deteriorated, he does not speak and strips naked in public. ""I blame the trauma of the fall and the time he's been forced to spend in hospital. ""I'm really on edge, I feel like I'm about to fall off a cliff. ""I break down in tears at least once a day. ""He's had his life taken away too soon. ""Are we saying that because he's too complicated, our society can't care for him? ""It seems like such a big fight to just find out from the hospital what is going on. ""I just hope to God that he doesn't understand what is happening to him. ""I feel like he'll never come home again, he seems lost to us."" John Perrinswas on the M6 motorway, driving home from Cambridge, when he realised he was having a heart attack. An ambulance driver himself, he had feared he would never see his wife again - so intense was the pain. But a paramedic saved his life at the side of the road. ""I was vomiting and felt like a horse was kicking me in the chest. ""My wife called an ambulance, which arrived within 10 minutes - seeing the blue lights was the most wonderful thing I've ever seen. ""I passed out, but apparently they performed three lots of heart massage - 90 compressions. ""When I came round they spoke to me and, although I was scared, the way that the paramedic spoke to me made me feel safe. ""The ambulance crew were absolutely phenomenal. ""A friend who is a paramedic came to see me and he told me that the last six heart attack patients he worked on had died - I felt so lucky that I had this particular ambulance crew. ""They have given me my life back. ""The paramedic was treating me, teaching a trainee and looking after my wife in the ambulance - I could not have asked for a better person. ""I am trying to find out the names of the ambulance crew - I want to find them so I can say thank you."" Trevor, 58, says that the NHS has treated his diabetes and depression ""brilliantly"" Trevor Dallimore-Wrightsays his local GP and hospital are ""like a family"" to him, regularly providing life-saving care for his complex health conditions. ""The NHS has been absolutely brilliant,"" says Trevor, from London, who has diabetes and depression. ""My GP keeps me sane and out of hospital - I would give her 10 out of 10. ""I've had emergency admittance twice recently with sepsis - I went to A&E and was treated very quickly. ""They've had a great impact on my life. ""NHS treatment has helped me during the times that I could not get out of bed. ""My GP is extremely kind and patient. They are so patient-centred, I would put them in the luxury bracket. ""All the hospital staff are extraordinarily friendly. ""They are there despite the infrastructure problems in the NHS, and the care could not be better. ""From the moment I walk in, I know I'm being looked after. ""My only problem is that the NHS won't pay for immunotherapy drugs which are at the front line of treatment but are expensive."" Nikki, 36, had her scheduled operation cancelled twice and she is still waiting Thirty six-year-oldNikki Alldis'satisfaction levels are at the other end of the spectrum, however, despite also living London. She says she has waited 15 months for a bowel operation, which has been twice cancelled. When the procedure was scheduled for early January, she mentally prepared her young children and rearranged her work. But Nikki has twice received a last-minute call telling her there is no bed space. She is still waiting. ""I'd prepared mentally - I planned my whole Christmas around the operation and recovery. I prepared frozen dinners for my kids, they are seven and 13, and I said a farewell goodbye. ""Then in the morning the nurse called me and said, 'We have no bed for you.' ""I was gutted. The kids were so confused when they came home and I was still there. ""I've been waiting for 15 months now - it's hanging over me. ""I did not believe the second appointment would happen, but I packed my bags anyway. ""We didn't even bother to rearrange my husband's work that time, if he's not working we're not earning, so we can't afford these cancellations. ""I put things in place with my work for people to cover me. ""I'm still waiting, hopefully it's third time lucky."" When 29-year-oldPaulwas feeling suicidal in January, the NHS crisis care team in west London gave him 24-hour care to keep him safe. He has received treatment for bipolar disorder for four years and says his consultant and crisis team are outstanding. ""They helped me in my darkest and most depressive hours,"" says Paul, who asked for his surname not to be revealed. ""I came back home after New Year and went back to day-to-day life, but it kicked off a hefty depression and I was left feeling really low and suicidal. ""My partner called the crisis team, and they came to our house three or four times a day. ""They come at 02:00 or 03:00, they are really responsive. ""I don't feel like they are just doing their jobs, they have genuine care for me. ""They take away my medication to make sure I will not overdose and when they visit, they make me take the medication. ""Sometimes they just spend time with me. ""They ask how I am, what did you eat and sometimes they make me do things like go and buy some milk, which I don't always feel able to do. ""I would not be alive without them. ""But one problem I have with NHS mental health care is that they medicate but do not do counselling, there is a massive waiting list, so now I have to get counselling privately."" ""Before she was diagnosed with cancer, my mum could run a marathon,"" saysRichard Taylor, 55 from Liverpool. He was devastated after watching her ""undignified"" death last month. The local cancer centre did not have the capacity to give her end-of-life care. ""After she received the second diagnosis, she was sent home and we got caught in a communication loop between three hospitals. It was an emotional rollercoaster. ""Eventually I had to take her to A&E  - she could not eat or drink. ""She spent 13 hours on a trolley, behind a curtain in a noisy and busy ward. ""I stayed on a chair beside her and slept on the floor - she died a week later. ""My gripe is with the lack of communication and the delays in my mum's treatment. ""The nursing staff were fantastic, but there is only so much they can do - they could not give my mum 24-hour attention. ""She was a very proud and dignified woman - but in the end she was simply scared to be alone. ""It was awful watching someone die in this extremely undignified way. ""If she was an animal, they would have put her down - she was starving and dehydrated. ""The nurses were lovely and compassionate, but they offered me no support.

"Many children now spend more time online than watching TV Like many parents, I am the unofficial IT manager in my house. And, like many IT managers, my users are never happy with the service they get. The complaints have got louder over the past few months as I have tried to manage how much time two of them (my teenage children) spend online and to restrict what they see. A patchwork of different technologies help me do this. It includes: rules on the router to limit net time apps on tablets to watch content software on PCs to spot malware and filter searches It works, after a fashion, but I know it has holes and that is why I also use a lot of sneakernet. This involves me walking around the house, kicking my kids off the game console, tablet, phone or TV (delete as appropriate) they are using when they should be doing homework, cleaning out the rabbit or getting ready for school. Research suggests I'm not alone in using tech to oversee online time - both to limit it and to help them stay safe. About 44% of parents use apps to oversee online activity, 39% check browser histories and 37% put controls on the router, suggests statistics gathered by security company Symantec. I use all three of those and want to use more. And it looked like technology was going to get even more useful as electronics companies released products with comprehensive parental controls onboard. Talking to children about their online habits can help limit cyber-bullying It's perhaps no surprise that parents are keen to turn to technology to help manage time online, says Nick Shaw, European general manager at security company Norton, because it's one area where they struggle to find help. ""When people have a parenting problem with their children, they might go to their own parents for advice,"" he says, ""but this is the one area where your parents are not as clued up as you are."" And, he says, children are even more clued up and easily capable of running rings around their parents. ""A lot of parents are very naive about this,"" he says. Even I got complacent because none of the tech I had put in place was sending me alerts. I thought it was all working fine and my children were browsing and gaming in an impenetrable bubble of safety. Wrong. Slowly I found out that by fiddling with system clocks, using safe mode and putting home PCs into sleep states, my two teenagers could avoid most of the locks and blocks. My schoolboy error, says Mr Shaw, was to let the hardware do the heavy lifting. ""Technology is going to help you,"" he says, ""but it's not going to get away from the fact that you should be having more conversations about this with your kids."" The parental controls of Norton's futuristic looking Core router are controlled via a smartphone What I should be doing, he says, is helping them to understand why the controls are needed. Explaining the reasons, he says, can help to defuse some of the objections. It is fair to say that my children and I have had some of these conversations. But they have been more of the ""play-less-games-and-do-more-maths"" type rather than the ""anti-virus-stops-your-YouTube-account-being-stolen"" sort. Tony Anscombe, security evangelist at anti-virus company Avast, says talking to children about safe ways to use the web is better than just imposing restrictions. ""Sure,"" he says, ""set some rules about how they should use it, but you should also educate your kids about basic security principles. ""A lot of parents just do not have the conversation, talking to them about what is acceptable and what is not."" This should cover not sharing passwords and thinking before they share personal data such as contact information, images and videos. Naivety puts many children at risk, he says, and it is worth reminding them about what can be done with that information and who might want it. Ofcom suggests UK parents are doing more to protect their children online, but threats remain (stock photo) It might not just fall into the hands of cyber-thieves, he says, it might also expose them to cyber-bullying or just be inappropriate to share. Warnings about the hidden features in popular apps are worth passing on, he says, as they often seek to scoop up more information than they really need. ""The biggest and most important thing that parents can do is run the apps their children do,"" he says. This will help parents understand what information children might share and uncover any hidden features the apps possess. Some, he says, look innocuous but are designed to help children conceal what they are doing. ""Gadgets are only half the story, if that,"" says Dr Sonia Livingstone, from the London School of Economics, who studies how children use the internet, as part of her work with the long-running EU Kids Online project. Companies should concentrate on doing less selling and more on designing services that do not need the protections they peddle, she says. In addition, she says, parents should encourage children to do the right thing by doing it themselves, rather than just by dictating terms. It's about respect too, she says, helping children make good decisions instead of arbitrarily imposing rules. If they can see the benefits of the rules, they are more likely to follow them. ""I am not very keen on the idea that parents have lots of control over their children,"" she says. ""Children have rights too.""

"Sgt David Evans has offered to buy Ivy and cover the cost of replacing her More than 15,000 people have signed a petition to allow a police dog to retire with her handler. Sgt David Evans, from Shropshire, is ""heartbroken"" at the prospect of not being able to keep four-year-old Ivy when he retires, his daughter said. She set up an online petition to gather support for her father, who is stepping down in April after 34 years' service. The chief constable has ""made a direct offer"" to speak to Sgt Evans. Police dogs normally retire about age eight. Latest reaction to the petition Sgt Evans, 59, has been told he will have to pass the animal - a Malinois cross German Shepherd - on to another handler to continue working, the family said. It takes about 13 weeks to train a police dog Purchase and initial training costs about Â£24,000 The dogs usually retire around the age of eight, depending on fitness If the dog is approaching retirement at the same time as its handler, it would be considered for retirement. In cases where dogs are still young, they will often be re-handled Source: West Mercia Police The petition calling for Ivy to be allowed to retire with her handler has been signed by people from as far afield as Canada and New Zealand West Mercia Police's chief constable has offered to speak to the officer personally about Ivy's future The petition has been signed by people from as far afield as Canada and New Zealand.  Daughter Jennie said the response was ""incredible"". She said Sgt Evans, of Market Drayton, had offered to buy Ivy and cover the cost of replacing her. Ms Evans said: ""Dad sacrificed many family moments with the support of his wife to enable him to undergo months of training with his police dogs. ""West Mercia need to show they appreciate these efforts and do not treat dogs as dispensable equipment that can be 'handed down' to other people.""

"Andrew Foster is the chief executive of Wrightington, Wigan and Leigh NHS Foundation Trust. It is one of the best performing hospital trusts and up until a year ago it was meeting the four-hour A&E target. But that began to change in 2016. Instead of hitting the 95% target for patients to be seen and treated or admitted, performance dropped to 90% and then 85% in the autumn, before it nosedived following Christmas. ""It started from Boxing Day onwards,"" says Mr Foster. ""We had an outbreak of norovirus which closed three wards and led to 75 staff being off sick. Seven care homes had to shut too. ""It meant our performance dropped to around 60%. It was the worst three weeks I've ever known. Cubicles in A&E were full, we had ambulance staff queuing in the corridors and we could not get patients out of hospital. The whole system backed up."" Since mid-January pressures have eased with four-hour performance back above 80%. But Mr Foster is still worried. ""The problem we have is that we are seeing more and more patients coming to A&E who could be seen by a GP and then we are finding it more difficult to discharge patients. There are simply not the places available any more because of the cuts to social care or we are seeing care homes and families themselves saying that the person's care is too complex. They end up staying in hospital."" Simon Walsh is a consultant in an A&E department in a major trauma centre in London. ""This year things have been closer to breaking point than I've ever known it before,"" he says. ""The set of nights I worked in the period before Christmas were the most difficult I remember working in the last 10 years. ""There was just such pressure on the system and as a result the exit block was so sustained that we had patients stuck for hours on end because there weren't any beds available to admit them on to wards. We had in excess of 20 patients at times for the whole night. And it just paralyses the emergency department."" He says patients and their families were understanding, even though they were frustrated. ""The relatives expressed their frustration but it wasn't anger directed at us - they recognised it was factors out of our control."" But he says morale was low among staff. ""I don't think I've ever seen such tired, exhausted people, they were absolutely dead on their feet. ""People try and keep each other up with as high morale as they can but I think people in that period were close to breaking point. ""I wondered if people would actually come back for the next shift after a couple of the nights we did."" Kimberley Gardner is a nurse at a major trauma centre in the East Midlands working in the critical care department, while her partner is also a nurse in the emergency department. She sayscalling the situation in the NHS a humanitarian crisis,as the Red Cross did in January, ""is not hyperbole, it is the reality"". ""It is the worst I've ever known it. ""During the coalition years we heard the term 'black alert' being thrown around, but it would never actually happen, it seemed as likely as a major disaster or terrorist attack - devastating- but highly unlikely. Now it's a weekly and sometimes daily occurrence and the novelty has worn off. ""Daily we get a phone call from an emergency department begging critical care for equipment to monitor patients as all of their resus bays have been 'doubled up' (where they put two patients in one bay) meaning they need two monitors but only have one. They ask us but we have run out also."" She says another issue is not enough trained paramedics or dispatchers for 111, the NHS non-emergency phoneline. ""The amount of people sent in by 111 to be on the safe side, it's a total failure. ""I saw a woman brought in by ambulance after eating a tin of Quality Street and she was vomiting - why would she ring an ambulance but also why did the crew bring her in? Because a lot of the time they are technicians and not trained paramedics so bring them in to be on the safe side."" Julie Orr is the head of clinical services for Milton Keynes University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust. She oversees the flow of patients through the hospital managing the site team, bed managers and discharge team. ""It's been a challenge this winter. I think the main difference has been that it's been sustained pressure. It's been quite relentless rather than periods of a couple of weeks of pressure. ""I've been in the NHS for 30 years and this is probably one of the most sustained, relentlessly pressured winters that I've seen. ""People don't really have time to catch their breath before the next onslaught of pressures."" Julie Orr with her team A former nursing manager, she says all her team are senior clinicians and move around the site ensuring the flow of patients through the hospital. ""We've had some very difficult days, which has meant that not only the site team but the managers on call and the executive on call have been on site for many, many hours into the night to make sure the patients are safe and that the staff are supported."" But she says her teams have coped ""remarkably well"" despite the pressure. ""Obviously it's very difficult. We all want to do the best for our patients and want to get them home wherever possible or on to the next stage of their journey - I think  sometimes there's not an understanding of why that can't happen. My discharge team along with the ward nursing teams spend a lot of time with patients trying to explain why there might be a delay in that happening."" Grainne Siggins is director of adult social care for the London Borough of Newham. ""Our staff and our staff within the NHS have worked incredibly hard this winter, it's been really difficult. But in December working positively with our colleagues we didn't have any delayed transfers (out of hospital) at all due to social care."" She knows from speaking to her local peers within London they are an ""outlier"" to be in this situation. Because of the borough's diverse population and high levels of deprivation and health issues they bring, the team has had to ""proactively plan"" - but she says ""it's becoming increasingly difficult going forward"". She says they have been heavily supported by their clinical commissioning group. ""Councils are currently prioritising adults and children's services above other areas of spending, but that will only go so far and we do feel we are at a tipping point and that's been borne out this winter - it's difficult to see how the whole system will be able to be sustained next year."" And she says the ageing population means assessments are taking much longer. ""People have got much more complex needs, multiple long term conditions, so we've got that added level of complexity. ""We've seen a significant increase in the level of support we then have to provide to people to make sure they can go home safely and that they are appropriately supported."" Dr Olivia Hum has been a GP since 2007. She works in a surgery in Lewes, east Sussex. ""The intensity of the work in 2017 is really bad. We work 10-12 hours a day without a break,"" she says. She says the demand on GPs has increased ""because of the pressure on hospitals"". ""A&E is too crowded which means that people are not diagnosed properly and they come to the GP for the rest of their health problems. They then bounce back to the hospital. ""The local hospital has seen a huge decline in funding, so people are on six to nine-month waiting lists. This has a huge impact on GPs who are dealing with the deteriorating symptoms of people waiting for tests or treatment, including patients who have symptoms of cancer. This waiting also has huge personal impact on patients, it increases their worry and stress."" She adds: ""There is a real crisis in GP staffing. Lots of practices are closing, so patients try to register at the practice next door which has no space. GPs are burning out, they are overworked and many are retiring early. The system is unsustainable now. ""It is just impossible to provide extra appointments in practices. I know GPs with almost twice as many patients as I have and they can only provide care at a very basic level. It is not safe - the brain can't make these decisions properly in less than 10 minutes. In these cases, quality of care and patient safety is compromised.""

"The NHS has come under intense pressure this winter, with record numbers of patients facing long waits in accident and emergency units among other challenges. We asked some of those who have fallen ill, and the families of others, to share their experiences of winter 2016-17. Sue'sfather's life changed dramatically after he fell out of bed while in hospital in December 2016. Bryan, 84, had been admitted to hospital near their house in Cornwall for a hip operation. Sue says she was not told about his fall for several days, eventually she was told he would not walk again and possibly had only six months left to live. ""I am devastated - six weeks ago everything was fine, now this is not the world I imagined I'd be in. ""In December he was walking into town, doing gardening, he loved mechanics and tinkering. ""Now in hospital his mental health has really deteriorated, he does not speak and strips naked in public. ""I blame the trauma of the fall and the time he's been forced to spend in hospital. ""I'm really on edge, I feel like I'm about to fall off a cliff. ""I break down in tears at least once a day. ""He's had his life taken away too soon. ""Are we saying that because he's too complicated, our society can't care for him? ""It seems like such a big fight to just find out from the hospital what is going on. ""I just hope to God that he doesn't understand what is happening to him. ""I feel like he'll never come home again, he seems lost to us."" John Perrinswas on the M6 motorway, driving home from Cambridge, when he realised he was having a heart attack. An ambulance driver himself, he had feared he would never see his wife again - so intense was the pain. But a paramedic saved his life at the side of the road. ""I was vomiting and felt like a horse was kicking me in the chest. ""My wife called an ambulance, which arrived within 10 minutes - seeing the blue lights was the most wonderful thing I've ever seen. ""I passed out, but apparently they performed three lots of heart massage - 90 compressions. ""When I came round they spoke to me and, although I was scared, the way that the paramedic spoke to me made me feel safe. ""The ambulance crew were absolutely phenomenal. ""A friend who is a paramedic came to see me and he told me that the last six heart attack patients he worked on had died - I felt so lucky that I had this particular ambulance crew. ""They have given me my life back. ""The paramedic was treating me, teaching a trainee and looking after my wife in the ambulance - I could not have asked for a better person. ""I am trying to find out the names of the ambulance crew - I want to find them so I can say thank you."" Trevor, 58, says that the NHS has treated his diabetes and depression ""brilliantly"" Trevor Dallimore-Wrightsays his local GP and hospital are ""like a family"" to him, regularly providing life-saving care for his complex health conditions. ""The NHS has been absolutely brilliant,"" says Trevor, from London, who has diabetes and depression. ""My GP keeps me sane and out of hospital - I would give her 10 out of 10. ""I've had emergency admittance twice recently with sepsis - I went to A&E and was treated very quickly. ""They've had a great impact on my life. ""NHS treatment has helped me during the times that I could not get out of bed. ""My GP is extremely kind and patient. They are so patient-centred, I would put them in the luxury bracket. ""All the hospital staff are extraordinarily friendly. ""They are there despite the infrastructure problems in the NHS, and the care could not be better. ""From the moment I walk in, I know I'm being looked after. ""My only problem is that the NHS won't pay for immunotherapy drugs which are at the front line of treatment but are expensive."" Nikki, 36, had her scheduled operation cancelled twice and she is still waiting Thirty six-year-oldNikki Alldis'satisfaction levels are at the other end of the spectrum, however, despite also living London. She says she has waited 15 months for a bowel operation, which has been twice cancelled. When the procedure was scheduled for early January, she mentally prepared her young children and rearranged her work. But Nikki has twice received a last-minute call telling her there is no bed space. She is still waiting. ""I'd prepared mentally - I planned my whole Christmas around the operation and recovery. I prepared frozen dinners for my kids, they are seven and 13, and I said a farewell goodbye. ""Then in the morning the nurse called me and said, 'We have no bed for you.' ""I was gutted. The kids were so confused when they came home and I was still there. ""I've been waiting for 15 months now - it's hanging over me. ""I did not believe the second appointment would happen, but I packed my bags anyway. ""We didn't even bother to rearrange my husband's work that time, if he's not working we're not earning, so we can't afford these cancellations. ""I put things in place with my work for people to cover me. ""I'm still waiting, hopefully it's third time lucky."" When 29-year-oldPaulwas feeling suicidal in January, the NHS crisis care team in west London gave him 24-hour care to keep him safe. He has received treatment for bipolar disorder for four years and says his consultant and crisis team are outstanding. ""They helped me in my darkest and most depressive hours,"" says Paul, who asked for his surname not to be revealed. ""I came back home after New Year and went back to day-to-day life, but it kicked off a hefty depression and I was left feeling really low and suicidal. ""My partner called the crisis team, and they came to our house three or four times a day. ""They come at 02:00 or 03:00, they are really responsive. ""I don't feel like they are just doing their jobs, they have genuine care for me. ""They take away my medication to make sure I will not overdose and when they visit, they make me take the medication. ""Sometimes they just spend time with me. ""They ask how I am, what did you eat and sometimes they make me do things like go and buy some milk, which I don't always feel able to do. ""I would not be alive without them. ""But one problem I have with NHS mental health care is that they medicate but do not do counselling, there is a massive waiting list, so now I have to get counselling privately."" ""Before she was diagnosed with cancer, my mum could run a marathon,"" saysRichard Taylor, 55 from Liverpool. He was devastated after watching her ""undignified"" death last month. The local cancer centre did not have the capacity to give her end-of-life care. ""After she received the second diagnosis, she was sent home and we got caught in a communication loop between three hospitals. It was an emotional rollercoaster. ""Eventually I had to take her to A&E  - she could not eat or drink. ""She spent 13 hours on a trolley, behind a curtain in a noisy and busy ward. ""I stayed on a chair beside her and slept on the floor - she died a week later. ""My gripe is with the lack of communication and the delays in my mum's treatment. ""The nursing staff were fantastic, but there is only so much they can do - they could not give my mum 24-hour attention. ""She was a very proud and dignified woman - but in the end she was simply scared to be alone. ""It was awful watching someone die in this extremely undignified way. ""If she was an animal, they would have put her down - she was starving and dehydrated. ""The nurses were lovely and compassionate, but they offered me no support.

"""Slaughter bulls"" and other banners appeared during Saturday's game in Dortmund Football hooliganism is nothing new in Germany, but when violence broke out before a Bundesliga match between two of the top clubs, this was something different. The stones and bottles thrown and the hate banners displayed by Borussia Dortmund supporters on Saturday exposed a widespread loathing in Germany for a team seen as upstarts, RB Leipzig. The club is challenging for Champions League football in its first ever season in the top flight. The hatred is because of the way they are wholly owned by one company, Red Bull. A wall of hatred was on view: ""Slaughter the bulls"", ""Red Bull, enemy of football"" were some of the milder slogans used. Families came under attack, and six fans and four police were hurt. One top football official Max Eberl said the violence was sick: ""Whether you like RB Leipzig or not, it shouldn't get out of hand."" Dortmund's fans are not alone. One tabloid newspaper, the Berliner Kurier, even refused to print the club's name a few weeks ago, using the insulting term""Dosenverkauf""(Can-sellers) in their Bundesliga table. Selling drinks is the core business of RB's owner, Red Bull, and there have been plenty more insults since the company bought a team in the Leipzig suburbs in 2009 and oversaw four promotions in seven seasons. Listen to Tim's BBC World Service programme here:The Rise of RB Leipzig The vitriol derives from RB's ownership model. Traditionally German football clubs are run without a single, rich investor. It is the members who must control a majority of the shares in the entity that owns the team. But RB Leipzig has only 17 members. It follows the letter of this law, but not its spirit. RB Leipzig have risen to the top flight in seven seasons Among the club's biggest critics is the chief executive at Borussia Dortmund, Hans-Joachim Watzke. ""It's a club built to push up the revenues for Red Bull and nothing else,"" he says. Read more on RB Leipzig here:RB Leipzig's rapid rise 'no fairytale' Andreas Bischof, whose blog in Leipzig pokes fun at the new club, goes further. ""This club is not owned or sponsored by a company, this club is like an outlet of a company,"" he says. ""It's a whole new level of using sports as a marketing vehicle."" But others argue that RB Leipzig is just what the city and surrounding region need. There has been little Bundesliga football in the former East Germany since unification in 1990. ""Football is a business that needs an enormous amount of money,"" says Martin Machowecz from weekly newspaper Die Zeit. ""And here's someone who's come along, got involved and made sure that we've now reached the same standard as in West Germany in an area of society that's important."" What RB as a club lacks in sporting history, its home city and its stadium provide. Lokomotive Leipzig beat Bordeaux on penalties in the 1987 Uefa Cup Winners' Cup semi-final but lost to Ajax in the final The German Football Association, the DFB, was founded there In 1903 VfB Leipzig became the first German champions The stadium was built in the 1950s partly from World War Two rubble With seating for 100,000 the Zentralstadion was the largest in the whole of Germany East Germany played many international matches, there as did Lokomotive Leipzig Lokomotive Leipzig became a household name when they beat Bordeaux in a penalty shoot-out to qualify for the final of the Uefa Cup Winners' Cup in 1987. The goalkeeper saved two penalties before stepping up to score the winner. Gerlinde Rohr looks back fondly on Lokomotive Leipzig's biggest moment in 1987 Gerlinde Rohr, now director of the Leipzig Sports Museum, was among the reported 110,000 in the stadium that night. ""I was there with a school mate and after Rene Mueller scored his goal I jumped on the seat and we embraced each other,"" she remembers. The Zentralstadion fell into disuse after unification but was given a new lease of life by the 2006 World Cup. The oval embankment of the old stadium was retained and a new stadium built inside it. It's now called the Red Bull Arena. Many see the appointment of Ralf Rangnick as the turning point for RBL, who had spent two frustrating seasons in the fourth tier before his arrival in 2012.  As sports director and, for a brief period, trainer, he oversaw three promotions in four seasons. Ralf Rangnick's key to success is youth. Timo Werner, 20 (R), is RBL's top scorer this season He likes to buy players who may never previously have had a professional contract and his squad is the youngest in the Bundesliga, with an average age of a little over 23. In his eyes, young players are hungrier for success and fit his playing philosophy. In Leipzig they place huge emphasis on pressing the other team high up the pitch and winning the ball in the opponent's half. ""Even if you're the best player in the world and you're being attacked by three players, you lose the ball,"" he says. Ralf Rangnick (C) watched Saturday's match at Dortmund with the club's supporters Ralf Rangnick also believes in the club's controversial ownership model. ""What do you need members for? I'm more interested in the number of supporters we have,"" he says. As for suggestions that Red Bull's owner Dietrich Mateschitz plays a big role in the way the club is run, the sports director says they meet and speak on the phone a handful of times every year. But what of the complaint that RB Leipzig is merely a vehicle for selling cans of energy drinks? ""For us it is completely unimportant,"" he says. ""It's got nothing to do with what we do.""

"The claim:The NHS could recover between Â£200m and Â£500m annually from foreign patients if a system of charging them in advance for non-emergency care worked perfectly. Reality Check verdict:The NHS recovered Â£358m in 2016-17 and Â£500m is the government's target for 2017-18. The NHS may struggle to meet that target, but it is not unreasonable to suggest that amount could be recouped by a perfect system. NHS hospitals in England now have tocharge patients from overseas up front for non-emergency careif they are not entitled to free treatment. Dr Mark Porter, from the British Medical Association, toldBBC Radio 5 livein February 2017 that the amount that could be recovered if the charging system worked perfectly was between Â£200m and Â£500m a year. He went on to say that was not very much money in the context of NHS spending and deficits, bearing in mind that the NHS budget in England was Â£116.4bn in 2015-16. A report,external- based on 2013 figures - estimates that treating all visitors and migrants in England (not only in hospitals) costs the NHS about Â£2bn, although it warns there is considerable uncertainty about that figure. That includes treating tourists who become ill while on holiday and longer-term migrants who have paid surcharges on their visas to be entitled to NHS care. Not all of that Â£2bn could be recovered. Treatment in A&E, for example, is free for everyone up to the point when a patient is either admitted to hospital or given an outpatient appointment. The government does recoup some of the Â£2bn, although not as much as it would like. It has a target to recoup Â£500m of the cost of treating overseas visitors by 2017-18. It has made considerable progress towards that goal, increasing the amount recouped from Â£97m in 2013-14 to Â£358m in 2016-17. A big proportion of that increase, Â£210m of it, has come from a health surcharge that must be paid by most students and temporary migrants from outside the European Economic Area (EEA) applying for visas to come to the UK for more than six months. Patients from inside the EEA with EHIC cards are generally treated free, with the government applying to their home countries to cover the cost. Those from elsewhere in the world who are not covered by the health surcharge will be charged for the cost of their treatment. Trusts are now allowed to charge 150% of the cost of treatment to patients from outside the EEA. The NHS has not been particularly good at recouping the costs in the past because trusts have not been good at identifying which patients should be charged for their treatment and it is difficult to collect money from patients living outside the EEA once they have returned home. The authorities have also not been particularly good at recouping the costs of treating people from EEA countries. This report from the National Audit Office,externalfrom October 2016 said that on current trends the NHS would not manage to recover Â£500m a year by 2017-18, although that was before the announcement of the change to the rules so that non-urgent care must be paid for upfront. The NAO estimated that trusts only manage to recover about half of the amount they invoiced overseas patients. The Department of Health estimated that in 2012-13 the potentially recoverable amount was Â£367m, but it excluded from that figure the estimated cost of between Â£100m and Â£300m for a combination of people who had travelled to England purely to receive urgent treatment and regular visitors who are described as ""taking advantage"" of the system by registering for GP services and other NHS services to which they are not entitled. All of these figures are estimates. Looking at the bottom end of the range, Â£200m is too low a figure as it is considerably less than is currently being collected. At the top end, Â£500m is the government's target - it is not unreasonable to suggest that amount could be collected by a perfect system. This article was originally published on 6 February 2017 and updated on 23 October 2017 with the 2016-17 figures for the amount recouped.

"Andrew Foster is the chief executive of Wrightington, Wigan and Leigh NHS Foundation Trust. It is one of the best performing hospital trusts and up until a year ago it was meeting the four-hour A&E target. But that began to change in 2016. Instead of hitting the 95% target for patients to be seen and treated or admitted, performance dropped to 90% and then 85% in the autumn, before it nosedived following Christmas. ""It started from Boxing Day onwards,"" says Mr Foster. ""We had an outbreak of norovirus which closed three wards and led to 75 staff being off sick. Seven care homes had to shut too. ""It meant our performance dropped to around 60%. It was the worst three weeks I've ever known. Cubicles in A&E were full, we had ambulance staff queuing in the corridors and we could not get patients out of hospital. The whole system backed up."" Since mid-January pressures have eased with four-hour performance back above 80%. But Mr Foster is still worried. ""The problem we have is that we are seeing more and more patients coming to A&E who could be seen by a GP and then we are finding it more difficult to discharge patients. There are simply not the places available any more because of the cuts to social care or we are seeing care homes and families themselves saying that the person's care is too complex. They end up staying in hospital."" Simon Walsh is a consultant in an A&E department in a major trauma centre in London. ""This year things have been closer to breaking point than I've ever known it before,"" he says. ""The set of nights I worked in the period before Christmas were the most difficult I remember working in the last 10 years. ""There was just such pressure on the system and as a result the exit block was so sustained that we had patients stuck for hours on end because there weren't any beds available to admit them on to wards. We had in excess of 20 patients at times for the whole night. And it just paralyses the emergency department."" He says patients and their families were understanding, even though they were frustrated. ""The relatives expressed their frustration but it wasn't anger directed at us - they recognised it was factors out of our control."" But he says morale was low among staff. ""I don't think I've ever seen such tired, exhausted people, they were absolutely dead on their feet. ""People try and keep each other up with as high morale as they can but I think people in that period were close to breaking point. ""I wondered if people would actually come back for the next shift after a couple of the nights we did."" Kimberley Gardner is a nurse at a major trauma centre in the East Midlands working in the critical care department, while her partner is also a nurse in the emergency department. She sayscalling the situation in the NHS a humanitarian crisis,as the Red Cross did in January, ""is not hyperbole, it is the reality"". ""It is the worst I've ever known it. ""During the coalition years we heard the term 'black alert' being thrown around, but it would never actually happen, it seemed as likely as a major disaster or terrorist attack - devastating- but highly unlikely. Now it's a weekly and sometimes daily occurrence and the novelty has worn off. ""Daily we get a phone call from an emergency department begging critical care for equipment to monitor patients as all of their resus bays have been 'doubled up' (where they put two patients in one bay) meaning they need two monitors but only have one. They ask us but we have run out also."" She says another issue is not enough trained paramedics or dispatchers for 111, the NHS non-emergency phoneline. ""The amount of people sent in by 111 to be on the safe side, it's a total failure. ""I saw a woman brought in by ambulance after eating a tin of Quality Street and she was vomiting - why would she ring an ambulance but also why did the crew bring her in? Because a lot of the time they are technicians and not trained paramedics so bring them in to be on the safe side."" Julie Orr is the head of clinical services for Milton Keynes University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust. She oversees the flow of patients through the hospital managing the site team, bed managers and discharge team. ""It's been a challenge this winter. I think the main difference has been that it's been sustained pressure. It's been quite relentless rather than periods of a couple of weeks of pressure. ""I've been in the NHS for 30 years and this is probably one of the most sustained, relentlessly pressured winters that I've seen. ""People don't really have time to catch their breath before the next onslaught of pressures."" Julie Orr with her team A former nursing manager, she says all her team are senior clinicians and move around the site ensuring the flow of patients through the hospital. ""We've had some very difficult days, which has meant that not only the site team but the managers on call and the executive on call have been on site for many, many hours into the night to make sure the patients are safe and that the staff are supported."" But she says her teams have coped ""remarkably well"" despite the pressure. ""Obviously it's very difficult. We all want to do the best for our patients and want to get them home wherever possible or on to the next stage of their journey - I think  sometimes there's not an understanding of why that can't happen. My discharge team along with the ward nursing teams spend a lot of time with patients trying to explain why there might be a delay in that happening."" Grainne Siggins is director of adult social care for the London Borough of Newham. ""Our staff and our staff within the NHS have worked incredibly hard this winter, it's been really difficult. But in December working positively with our colleagues we didn't have any delayed transfers (out of hospital) at all due to social care."" She knows from speaking to her local peers within London they are an ""outlier"" to be in this situation. Because of the borough's diverse population and high levels of deprivation and health issues they bring, the team has had to ""proactively plan"" - but she says ""it's becoming increasingly difficult going forward"". She says they have been heavily supported by their clinical commissioning group. ""Councils are currently prioritising adults and children's services above other areas of spending, but that will only go so far and we do feel we are at a tipping point and that's been borne out this winter - it's difficult to see how the whole system will be able to be sustained next year."" And she says the ageing population means assessments are taking much longer. ""People have got much more complex needs, multiple long term conditions, so we've got that added level of complexity. ""We've seen a significant increase in the level of support we then have to provide to people to make sure they can go home safely and that they are appropriately supported."" Dr Olivia Hum has been a GP since 2007. She works in a surgery in Lewes, east Sussex. ""The intensity of the work in 2017 is really bad. We work 10-12 hours a day without a break,"" she says. She says the demand on GPs has increased ""because of the pressure on hospitals"". ""A&E is too crowded which means that people are not diagnosed properly and they come to the GP for the rest of their health problems. They then bounce back to the hospital. ""The local hospital has seen a huge decline in funding, so people are on six to nine-month waiting lists. This has a huge impact on GPs who are dealing with the deteriorating symptoms of people waiting for tests or treatment, including patients who have symptoms of cancer. This waiting also has huge personal impact on patients, it increases their worry and stress."" She adds: ""There is a real crisis in GP staffing. Lots of practices are closing, so patients try to register at the practice next door which has no space. GPs are burning out, they are overworked and many are retiring early. The system is unsustainable now. ""It is just impossible to provide extra appointments in practices. I know GPs with almost twice as many patients as I have and they can only provide care at a very basic level. It is not safe - the brain can't make these decisions properly in less than 10 minutes. In these cases, quality of care and patient safety is compromised.""

"The NHS has come under intense pressure this winter, with record numbers of patients facing long waits in accident and emergency units among other challenges. We asked some of those who have fallen ill, and the families of others, to share their experiences of winter 2016-17. Sue'sfather's life changed dramatically after he fell out of bed while in hospital in December 2016. Bryan, 84, had been admitted to hospital near their house in Cornwall for a hip operation. Sue says she was not told about his fall for several days, eventually she was told he would not walk again and possibly had only six months left to live. ""I am devastated - six weeks ago everything was fine, now this is not the world I imagined I'd be in. ""In December he was walking into town, doing gardening, he loved mechanics and tinkering. ""Now in hospital his mental health has really deteriorated, he does not speak and strips naked in public. ""I blame the trauma of the fall and the time he's been forced to spend in hospital. ""I'm really on edge, I feel like I'm about to fall off a cliff. ""I break down in tears at least once a day. ""He's had his life taken away too soon. ""Are we saying that because he's too complicated, our society can't care for him? ""It seems like such a big fight to just find out from the hospital what is going on. ""I just hope to God that he doesn't understand what is happening to him. ""I feel like he'll never come home again, he seems lost to us."" John Perrinswas on the M6 motorway, driving home from Cambridge, when he realised he was having a heart attack. An ambulance driver himself, he had feared he would never see his wife again - so intense was the pain. But a paramedic saved his life at the side of the road. ""I was vomiting and felt like a horse was kicking me in the chest. ""My wife called an ambulance, which arrived within 10 minutes - seeing the blue lights was the most wonderful thing I've ever seen. ""I passed out, but apparently they performed three lots of heart massage - 90 compressions. ""When I came round they spoke to me and, although I was scared, the way that the paramedic spoke to me made me feel safe. ""The ambulance crew were absolutely phenomenal. ""A friend who is a paramedic came to see me and he told me that the last six heart attack patients he worked on had died - I felt so lucky that I had this particular ambulance crew. ""They have given me my life back. ""The paramedic was treating me, teaching a trainee and looking after my wife in the ambulance - I could not have asked for a better person. ""I am trying to find out the names of the ambulance crew - I want to find them so I can say thank you."" Trevor, 58, says that the NHS has treated his diabetes and depression ""brilliantly"" Trevor Dallimore-Wrightsays his local GP and hospital are ""like a family"" to him, regularly providing life-saving care for his complex health conditions. ""The NHS has been absolutely brilliant,"" says Trevor, from London, who has diabetes and depression. ""My GP keeps me sane and out of hospital - I would give her 10 out of 10. ""I've had emergency admittance twice recently with sepsis - I went to A&E and was treated very quickly. ""They've had a great impact on my life. ""NHS treatment has helped me during the times that I could not get out of bed. ""My GP is extremely kind and patient. They are so patient-centred, I would put them in the luxury bracket. ""All the hospital staff are extraordinarily friendly. ""They are there despite the infrastructure problems in the NHS, and the care could not be better. ""From the moment I walk in, I know I'm being looked after. ""My only problem is that the NHS won't pay for immunotherapy drugs which are at the front line of treatment but are expensive."" Nikki, 36, had her scheduled operation cancelled twice and she is still waiting Thirty six-year-oldNikki Alldis'satisfaction levels are at the other end of the spectrum, however, despite also living London. She says she has waited 15 months for a bowel operation, which has been twice cancelled. When the procedure was scheduled for early January, she mentally prepared her young children and rearranged her work. But Nikki has twice received a last-minute call telling her there is no bed space. She is still waiting. ""I'd prepared mentally - I planned my whole Christmas around the operation and recovery. I prepared frozen dinners for my kids, they are seven and 13, and I said a farewell goodbye. ""Then in the morning the nurse called me and said, 'We have no bed for you.' ""I was gutted. The kids were so confused when they came home and I was still there. ""I've been waiting for 15 months now - it's hanging over me. ""I did not believe the second appointment would happen, but I packed my bags anyway. ""We didn't even bother to rearrange my husband's work that time, if he's not working we're not earning, so we can't afford these cancellations. ""I put things in place with my work for people to cover me. ""I'm still waiting, hopefully it's third time lucky."" When 29-year-oldPaulwas feeling suicidal in January, the NHS crisis care team in west London gave him 24-hour care to keep him safe. He has received treatment for bipolar disorder for four years and says his consultant and crisis team are outstanding. ""They helped me in my darkest and most depressive hours,"" says Paul, who asked for his surname not to be revealed. ""I came back home after New Year and went back to day-to-day life, but it kicked off a hefty depression and I was left feeling really low and suicidal. ""My partner called the crisis team, and they came to our house three or four times a day. ""They come at 02:00 or 03:00, they are really responsive. ""I don't feel like they are just doing their jobs, they have genuine care for me. ""They take away my medication to make sure I will not overdose and when they visit, they make me take the medication. ""Sometimes they just spend time with me. ""They ask how I am, what did you eat and sometimes they make me do things like go and buy some milk, which I don't always feel able to do. ""I would not be alive without them. ""But one problem I have with NHS mental health care is that they medicate but do not do counselling, there is a massive waiting list, so now I have to get counselling privately."" ""Before she was diagnosed with cancer, my mum could run a marathon,"" saysRichard Taylor, 55 from Liverpool. He was devastated after watching her ""undignified"" death last month. The local cancer centre did not have the capacity to give her end-of-life care. ""After she received the second diagnosis, she was sent home and we got caught in a communication loop between three hospitals. It was an emotional rollercoaster. ""Eventually I had to take her to A&E  - she could not eat or drink. ""She spent 13 hours on a trolley, behind a curtain in a noisy and busy ward. ""I stayed on a chair beside her and slept on the floor - she died a week later. ""My gripe is with the lack of communication and the delays in my mum's treatment. ""The nursing staff were fantastic, but there is only so much they can do - they could not give my mum 24-hour attention. ""She was a very proud and dignified woman - but in the end she was simply scared to be alone. ""It was awful watching someone die in this extremely undignified way. ""If she was an animal, they would have put her down - she was starving and dehydrated. ""The nurses were lovely and compassionate, but they offered me no support. ""The NHS is a great thing, but it is under the hammer.""
