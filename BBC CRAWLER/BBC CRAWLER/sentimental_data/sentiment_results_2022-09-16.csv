"A planned meeting between Liz Truss and US President Joe Biden before the Queen's funeral has been cancelled, Downing Street has said. No 10 said a ""full bilateral meeting"" between the PM and Mr Biden would instead take place at the UN General Assembly on Wednesday. It is thought holding the talks after the period of national mourning would allow more wide-ranging discussions. Ms Truss met her counterparts from New Zealand and Australia on Saturday. The prime minister held informal talks with Jacinda Ardern and Australian premier Anthony Albanese at Chevening House in Kent. And Number 10 confirmed Ms Truss will see Irish Taoiseach [prime minister] MicheÃ¡l Martin, Canadian PM Justin Trudeau, and Polish President Andrzej Duda at Downing Street on Sunday. Although she met Mr Biden when she was foreign secretary, next week's UN meeting with him in New York will be Ms Truss's first as UK prime minister. How the Queen's funeral day will unfold Who's invited to the Queen's funeral - and who's not? Mammoth task of organising '100 state visits at once' Monday's funeral will be one of the biggest diplomatic events of recent years, with some 500 heads of state and foreign dignitaries expected to attend. It is providing Ms Truss with an opportunity to meet foreign counterparts less than two weeks after taking office. But Downing Street had stressed that talks this weekend would not be formal bilateral meetings because of the official 10-day mourning period following the death of the Queen. It would not be issuing summaries of the discussions as would normally happen after the PM's meetings with foreign leaders, No 10 added. As a former foreign secretary, Liz Truss is not exactly new to rubbing shoulders with world leaders. She'll see a lot of them over this weekend. Meeting them as prime minister, though, is different and the first meeting with the US president is always the biggest for a new PM. When Liz Truss and Joe Biden do sit down, it will be closely scrutinised for any indications of the health, or otherwise, of the ""special relationship"". I'm told that holding it after the official mourning period means it can be much more focused on business rather than reflecting on the Queen. There is a lot of business to tackle. Joe Biden is no fan of Liz Truss's approach to the Northern Ireland Protocol, for a start. The US has suggested it is ""not conducive"" to the other not-so-small matter of a trade deal. All this will have to wait though, until later in the week. In advance of her talks with Ms Truss, Ms Ardern said the death of the Queen would be the ""focus of conversation"", and they were also likely to discuss Ukraine and the UK'sfree trade agreement with New Zealand.announced last October. It was thought the meeting between Ms Truss and Mr Albanese focused on trade, after thesigning of a deal between the UK and Australia in December. Ms Truss also held a phone call with the President of the UAE, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al Nahyan, on Saturday in which he expressed his condolences on the death of the Queen. The meeting with the Irish Republic's prime minister comes at a time of strained relations with the EU over post-Brexit checks in Northern Ireland. The UK is refusing to apply some of the checks it signed up to in the Brexit withdrawal deal, prompting aseries of lawsuits from the EU. Liz Truss met Joe Biden in Glasgow last November, when he attended the COP 26 climate summit Mr Martin has expressed concern about legislation Ms Truss introduced as foreign secretary enabling the UK to alter the legal commitments it signed up to in the exit treaty in 2019. Ms Truss is expected to meet European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen for talks at the UN meeting in New York next week. The state funeral service in Westminster Abbey on Monday is expected to be attended by hundreds of foreign dignitaries, including politicians and royalty. Syria, Venezuela, Afghanistan, Myanmar, Russia and Belarus have not been invited - whilst Iran, North Korea and Nicaragua have been asked to only send a senior diplomat. China's President Xi Jinping is on the guest list for the funeral ceremony but is not thought likely to attend. A Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman said on Friday that no decision had been made on whether they would be sending a delegation, although press reports have suggested China's vice-president will attend. Ms Truss is expected to have a phone call with the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed Bin Salman on Saturday evening. The de factoruler's invitation to the Queen's funeral has sparked protestsfrom human rights campaigners. A declassified CIA report concluded that he had authorised the murder and dismemberment of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi - allegations denied by the crown prince.

"A still from a video released by Kyrgyz border guards, which they said showed fighting on the border Almost 30 people have been reported killed and dozens injured in clashes on the Kyrgyzstan-Tajikistan border. Fighting regularly flares up between the two former Soviet states, whose border has been disputed since the collapse of the USSR. A fresh skirmish which began earlier in the week continued on Friday, despite the two countries agreeing a ceasefire. Both sides blame the other for beginning the violence and breaching the ceasefire. Some 24 people in Kyrgyzstan have so far been killed, the Kyrgyz health ministry said on Friday. Earlier reports from Tajikistan said at least three people had been killed there. Almost 20,000 people have fled their homes to avoid the violence, a regional branch of the Red Cross reported. The conflict has renewed fears of an all-out war between the two countries. In 2021,unprecedented fighting killed almost 50 people. The dispute flared up on Wednesday with at least two people killed in three separate incidents. Kyrgyz border guards accused Tajikistan of taking positions on part of the border that has not been demarcated, while Tajikistan said Kyrgyz guards had opened fire without provocation. The countries share a 1,000-km (600-mile) border, more than a third of which is disputed. Russia - which has close ties with both countries - has offered to mediate, calling for ""urgent"" measures to stop the violence on Friday. A ceasefire took effect from 16:00 local time (10:00 GMT), but Kyrgyzstan said two of its villages were later shelled. It accused its neighbour of using tanks and armoured personnel carriers. In turn, Tajikistan accused Kyrgyz forces of shelling an outpost and seven villages with ""heavy weaponry"".

"This video can not be played King Charles III speaks in Welsh in a historic moment for a monarch King Charles III said Wales held a ""special place"" in the Queen's heart as he gave a speech in Welsh on his first visit as the new monarch. He addressed members of the Welsh Parliament in a remembrance event at the Senedd as part of the King and Queen Consort's tour of the UK nations. In a bilingual speech, King Charles gave the Senedd his ""heartfelt thanks for your kind words"". He added that it had been a ""privilege to be Prince of Wales for so long"". The King said Prince William, who was appointed Prince of Wales last week, had a ""deep love"" for the nation. He said the ""ancient title"" dated to the time ""of those great Welsh rulers likeLlywelyn ap Gruffydd, whose memory is still rightly honoured"". Live: Thousands queue to pay respects to Queen In pictures: King's first Wales visit as monarch The Wales-loving prince who is now King ThankingMembers of the Seneddfor their condolences followingthe death of the Queenat the age of 96 last week, the King said that ""through all the years of her reign the land of Wales could not have been closer to my mother's heart"". King Charles III meets schoolchildren and the rest of the crowds outside Llandaff Cathedral on his first visit to Wales as a monarch ""Roedd lle arbenig i Gymru yn ei chalon,"" he said, which translates as ""Wales had a special place in her heart"". ""Fel fy mam annwyl o'm blaen, rwy'n gwybod ein bod ni oll yn caru'r wlad arbennig hon,"" he added, which translates as ""like my beloved mother before me, I know we all share a love for this special land"". As Prince of Wales, Charles often delivered passages of speeches in Welsh - including at the first official opening of what was then called the assembly, in 1999. He told the Senedd it had been a ""privilege to be Prince of Wales for so long"" He added in English: ""I know she took immense pride in your many great achievements, even as she also felt with you deeply in time of sorrow. ""It must surely be counted the greatest privilege to belong to a land that could inspire such devotion. King Charles III and the Queen Consort received a posy of flowers from a five-year-old Keira Hillebert as they left Llandaff Cathedral ""Having visited the Senedd regularly since it was founded, and having heard your heartfelt words today, I know we all share the deepest commitment to the welfare of the people of this land, and that we will all continue to work together to that end."" First Minister Mark Drakeford said in his audience with the King on Friday, King Charles spoke of his concern about how people in Wales would cope in the coming months with the cost of living crisis. Mr Drakeford told Talk TV: ""He is concerned as to how people will manage through what is going to be a difficult winter. ""He was interested to tell me about some of the projects that he has heard of, or become involved in dealing, for example, with food waste, making sure that we don't waste a precious resource when some people might be going without."" Hundreds of well wishers greeted the royal couple in Cardiff Bay, where they also met Welsh Youth Parliament members who told them about their work The last reigning monarch to visit Wales was Queen Elizabeth II when she officially opened the sixth Senedd term in October 2021 King Charles had Welsh lessons at Aberystwyth University beforehis investiture at Caernarfon Castle in 1969. His tutor was the academic Tedi Millward, a Welsh nationalist campaigner. After Dr Millward's death in 2020, the then-Prince Charles paid tribute to him, but admitted he may not have been his finest pupil. Elin Jones, the presiding officer of the Welsh Parliament, said the use of Welsh in the King's speech to the Senedd, was ""hugely significant"". The Llywydd said it ""shows the world that Wales has two languages"". ""It's used by the King and used by the people on the streets as well, and that's a significant moment,"" she told BBC Wales. This video can not be played The King went to Llandaff Cathedral, the Senedd and a reception at Cardiff Castle Analysis by David Deans, BBC Wales political reporter King Charles III's speech in the Senedd was a historic step for a British monarch. While his mother Elizabeth spoke small phrases in the Welsh language, the King's speech on Friday was bilingual, switched from English to Welsh throughout. It was a mark of respect by the monarch for the culture of Wales, in the similar way that the entire visit was recognition of the place the Welsh Parliament and government have in the UK constitution. This video can not be played King Charles III was the longest serving Prince of Wales before he became monarch Both are important in the context of a language which activists had fought in the past to protect, and institutions that had a rocky few early years at the dawn of devolution 23 years ago. It is unlikely to be enough to change views on the monarchy, like those held by the protesters outside Cardiff Castle on Friday. However, there have been few expressions of republicanism in this period of mourning from senior figures in Welsh public life. That is despite the personal views of First Minister Mark Drakeford and Senedd Presiding Officer Elin Jones - both republicans who have taken a full part in this week's proceedings. King Charles arrived in Cardiff via helicopter from his Gloucestershire home of Highgrove following a day of rest after a week of duties since the death of the Queen.

King Charles III and the Queen Consort sang a number of hymns during the service, including traditional Welsh song Cwm Rhondda Archbishop of Wales, the Most Rev Andrew John, delivered an address to the congregation - which included Prime Minister Liz Truss in her first visit to Wales as prime minister - in both English and Welsh. Paying tribute to her ""extraordinary legacy of service and devotion"", the archbishop said the Queen had transformed the monarchy and provided a reassuring constancy through the decades. Prime Minister Liz Truss is greeted by Dean of Llandaff Cathedral Michael Komor on her arrival The archbishop said the late Queen's skilful use of ""soft power"" came to the fore during her visits to Aberfan after the disaster there in 1966 when the community found her presence ""deeply consoling"". The hour-long service included hymns Pantyfedwen (Tydi A Wnaeth Y Wyrth), God is Love Let Heaven Adore Him and Cwm Rhondda and their visit to Llandaff ended with King Charles and the Queen Consort meeting schoolchildren in the crowd as they left the cathedral.

Ms Morgan said she believed the King would ""continue that bond with Aberfan and the people of Aberfan"". The Band of the Royal Welsh played the national anthem as the royal couple made their way to the front of the castle, with military goat Lance Corporal Shenkin IV stationed at the front.

"The stabbing took place on Great Windmill Street A police officer has been left with a potentially life-changing injury in a central London attack that also saw her colleague stabbed in the neck. The stabbing near Leicester Square at 06:00 BST is not related to the Queen's death or terror-related, police say. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan branded the incident ""utterly appalling"" at a ""momentous time for our country"". A man in his 20s has been arrested on suspicion of grievous bodily harm and assaulting an emergency worker. The Met described the stab wounds as ""significant"" The female officer was stabbed in the arm before her male colleague ran after the ""frenzied"" suspect and a tussle ensued, Met Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley said. The male officer was ""very seriously injured"" after being stabbed three times in the neck and once in the chest but should make a full recovery, he added. Other colleagues joined and fired a Taser at the suspect during the ""violent struggle"" on Great Windmill Street, near Shaftesbury Avenue. He was subdued then arrested, Sir Mark said. He has since been discharged from hospital into police custody. There is a large police presence on Haymarket Forensic teams have been sent to the scene The officers' families have been told about the ""very concerning"" attack, Scotland Yard said. Praising the officers' bravery, Sir Mark said: ""It's a reminder to me that with all the calls for reforming the Metropolitan Police, which are absolutely necessary, we should never forget that we've got thousands of dedicated men and women going out every day who are prepared to be brave for Londoners."" The stabbing took place close to Haymarket, between Leicester Square and Piccadilly Circus, which is home to many of London's theatres and Chinatown. By Jay Gardner, BBC London Leicester Square, an area usually bustling with commuters and tourists, is almost completely inaccessible to the public. Police lines stretch from Haymarket south to Leicester Place, with the northern half of the square completely shut off. Several police officers are patrolling the cordon, with the strongest presence on Coventry Street, near the junction with Haymarket. In the no man's land between the police tape, there are a few police cars and vans. I also spotted an incident response vehicle left nearby. There is a sense of confusion among those in area. Shop owners tell me they came to work and saw the police setting up the cordon, but eyewitnesses are hard to come by as it seems the attacks happened too early for anyone to see in an area famed for its nightlife. Overnight, two other officers were injured, including one who was driven into by a car in south London, according to London's mayor. Mr Khan said: ""These brave officers were doing their duty and assisting the public at this momentous time for our country. ""My thoughts and prayers are with them, their loved ones and police colleagues following this disgraceful attack."" Home Secretary Suella Braverman said she was ""concerned"" about the attack and praised the bravery of police officers. Martin Hewitt, the chair of police chiefs, described the attack as ""terrible news"".

"Police denied eyewitness reports that Mahsa Amini had been beaten A 22-year-old Iranian woman has died days after being arrested by morality police for allegedly not complying with strict rules on head coverings. Eyewitnesses said Mahsa Amini was beaten while inside a police van when she was picked up in Tehran on Tuesday. Police have denied the allegations, saying Ms Amini had ""suddenly suffered a heart problem"". It is the latest in a series of reports of brutality against women by authorities in Iran in recent weeks. Ms Amini's family say that she was a healthy young woman with no medical conditions that would explain a sudden heart problem. However, they were informed she had been taken to hospital a few hours after her arrest and the family said she had been in a coma before she died on Friday. Tehran police said Ms Amini had been arrested for ""justification and education"" about the hijab, the headscarf which is mandatory for all women to wear. Her death comes in the wake of growing reports of repressive acts against women, including those judged not to be complying with Islamic dress code being barred from entering government offices and banks. Many Iranians, including pro-government individuals, are expressing their outrage on social media platforms regarding the very existence of the morality police, also known as Guidance Patrols, and are using hashtags that translate as Murder Patrols. Videos have emerged on social media appearing to show officers detaining women, dragging them on the ground, and forcefully whisking them away. Many Iranians blame the Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, directly.  An old speech of his is being reshared on social media in which he justifies the role of the morality police and insists that under Islamic rule, women must be forced to observe the Islamic dress code. The latest episode will only deepen the divide between a large part of Iran's young and vibrant society and its radical rulers, a rift that seems ever harder to mend. Iran's headscarf video sparks mixed reaction Iranian women threw off the hijab - then what? The Girls of Revolution Street.

"The queue to see the Queen lying in state at Westminster Hall has reopened after entry was officially paused for seven hours, the government has said. But mourners have been warned to expect waiting times of at least 19-and-a-half hours and cold overnight temperatures. Despite the official statement people told the BBC they had managed to join the queue throughout the day. The line is now about five miles (8km) long, stretching to Southwark Park in south-east London. Thousands have paid their respects to the Queen, who is lying in state at Westminster until 06:30 BST on Monday. A separate queue for people with accessibility needs has been paused until midday on Saturday, the government said. The Department for Digital, Media, Culture and Sport (DCMS) had said entrance to the main queue had been paused around 10:00 this morning after it had grown on Thursday and overnight into Friday. However, people locally said the park and entrance to the line were only closed for around 30 minutes, with another queue then forming outside the park before the gates were soon reopened. At 17:05 the government announced that entry to the queue, at Southwark Park, had been resumed. The government has said entry could be closed again should capacity be reached once more. Regular updates arebeing published on Twitter,external, with a live queue trackeralso available on YouTube,external. The Met Office has said overnight temperatures were expected to be as low as 8C (46F) and the government has said warm clothing is recommended. On Friday evening all entry slots had been allocated for the queue for people with accessibility needs, the DCMS said. ""For everyone's comfort, please do not attempt to join the accessible queue before midday tomorrow,"" the department said. Earlier, Andrea, who is disabled and joined the queue with her mother, told BBC Radio 5 Live they had been abruptly told to ""go home because we're not going to let anybody else through"". ""We tried to speak to some of the stewards, and they were very nice but they just kept repeating the mantra that we had to return home and that they weren't going to let anybody else come in to get a timed slot,"" she said - adding she thought people had joined the line for people with accessibility needs after the closure of the main queue. ""I find it a bit ironic that the main queue is allowed to go on, it's just been temporarily suspended, but we've been told to go home and come back the next day - when we're disabled,"" she said. This video can not be played Queen Elizabeth II: The six mile queue to see the Queen lying in state The queue follows the south bank of the River Thames from the Palace of Westminster, through Lambeth, Southwark, and into Bermondsey. One of those who did manage to make it onto it was former England footballer David Beckham who told the BBC he had waited for more than 12 hours to ""celebrate the amazing life of our Queen"". He shared doughnuts and crisps with fellow mourners and posed for photographs while waiting in line, before bowing before the Queen's coffin once he had entered the hall. London Ambulance Service said it had treated 435 members of the public along the queue route over the past two days, with 42 of those requiring hospital treatment. The majority of incidents were faints and collapses resulting in head injuries, the service said. Meanwhile, a man has appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Courtafter two women were allegedly sexually assaultedin the queue to attend the Queen's lying-in-state.

"The Queen's grandchildren, including the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Sussex, will observe a 15-minute vigil on Saturday at her lying-in-state. At King Charles' request, Princes William and Harry will both wear military uniform for the occasion. The brothers will be joined by Peter Phillips, Zara Tindall, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, Lady Louise Windsor, and James, Viscount Severn. Prince Harry has worn a morning suit at public events since the Queen's death. It means the vigil will be the first time he has been seen in military uniform since stepping back as a senior royal in 2020. Queen Elizabeth II will lie in state at Westminster Hall until Monday, the day of her funeral, with the lying-in-state queue stretching as far as Southwark Park. Prince Harry, who served two tours in Afghanistan as part of the Army, now lives in California with his wife Meghan and their two children. Prince Harry's spokesperson previously said he would ""wear a morning suit throughout events honouring his grandmother"". The spokesperson added: ""His decade of military service is not determined by the uniform he wears and we respectfully ask that focus remain on the life and legacy of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II."" The Prince of Wales will stand at the head of the Queen's coffin, while the Duke of Sussex will stand at the foot, Buckingham Palace said. The King's request now means Prince Harry will wear military uniform for the vigil, in line with an exception already given to the Duke of York. Prince Andrew will be allowed to wear his own military uniform at a vigil observed by the Queen's children later on Friday, despitestepping back from royal dutiesin 2019. King Charles and his three siblings, Princess Anne, the Duke of York and Earl of Wessex, will stand in a vigil at the lying-in-state in Westminster Hall. They previously did so as the Queen lay at rest in St Giles' Cathedral in Edinburgh. In a statement released on Friday, Prince Edward thanked the public for their support. He said: ""We have been overwhelmed by the tide of emotion that has engulfed us and the sheer number of people who have gone out of their way to express their own love, admiration and respect to such a very special and unique person who was always there for us. ""And now, we are there for her, united in grief."" On Monday, Prince Harrywrote of his grandmother's ""infectious smile"" as he paid tribute to her. He described the ""special moments"" they had shared, including his memories of the Queen attending his passing-out parade in 2006 when he became an officer in the British Army.

"The alleged victims were among thousands who have been lining the banks of the Thames to view the Queen's coffin Two women were allegedly sexually assaulted in the queue to attend the Queen's lying-in-state, a court heard. Adio Adeshine is accused of exposing himself and pushing into the mourners from behind as they waited in line at Victoria Tower Gardens on Wednesday. He is charged with two counts of sexual assault and two counts of breaching a sexual harm prevention order. The 19-year-old appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Friday. Outlining the allegations, prosecutor Alex Adowale, said: ""The defendant was part of the queue to see the resting in state of Queen Elizabeth II."" His alleged victims are said to have been among the thousands of people who have been lining the banks of the River Thames to view the Queen's coffin. The court heard the first complainant allegedly noticed Mr Adeshine because she had not previously seen him, despite having waited in the queue with the same people for hours. She is said to have noticed him getting closer to her before feeling something touching her back, then turned to see he had exposed himself. The woman later allegedly saw Mr Adeshine acting in a similar way towards another woman, before security were alerted and police called. He is said to have thrown his phone into the River Thames before entering the water himself. But the court heard Mr Adeshine was arrested shortly after coming out of the river. Deputy Chief Magistrate refused to grant Mr Adeshine bail, remanding him in custody ahead of his next appearance at Southwark Crown Court on 14 October.

"Chris Kaba, who was due to become a father, died in the early hours of 6 September about two hours after he was shot The police watchdog will examine whether race was a factor in the fatal shooting of a black man by an officer. Chris Kaba, who was unarmed, was shot on 5 September after a pursuit that ended in south London. His family has accused the Met Police of racism. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) is conducting an investigation into the shooting. Mr Kaba's family criticised how long the investigation may take to give answers. In a statement the family's lawyer Daniel Machover said: ""Six to nine months for this investigation is unacceptably long and lacks urgency. ""It indicates insufficient resources to do the job."" The IOPC said it ""will examine whether or not Mr Kaba's race influenced any actions taken by the police"". In a statement, it added: ""We must explore all of the circumstances surrounding Mr Kaba's death including: how the officers came to be aware of the vehicle Mr Kaba was driving; if they had any prior knowledge of Mr Kaba; and their decision-making and actions on 5 September."" The Metropolitan Police firearms officer who shot the 24-year-old is suspended from duty. Man shot dead by police after pursuit Chris Kaba family says officer suspension too slow Police concern over shooting death suspension Met Police Assistant Commissioner Amanda Pearson said: ""We continue to fully support the IOPC investigation as they work to establish the facts and try to answer the many questions Mr Kaba's family and others have around his tragic death. ""We've been spending this week speaking with local communities across London, including our Independent Advisory Groups - we know how important it is we listen to their views and concerns and explain as far as we can what is happening. We welcome more of these important conversations."" The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said the IOPC ""must go wherever the evidence takes them"". He added: ""I fully understand the grave concerns and impact of Chris Kaba's death on black Londoners across our city and the anger, pain and fear it has caused across our communities - as well as the desire for justice and change. ""The IOPC have confirmed to me that they are fully committed to carrying out a thorough and comprehensive investigation to establish all of the facts - with all key findings made public. I'm clear that the independent investigation must be fearless and leave no stone unturned."" The IPOC said it had been in contact with Mr Kaba's family regarding the investigation, which is expected to take six to nine months to complete.

"This BeReally familiar: TikTok Now is billed as a ""new way to connect"" but people are pointing out the idea isn't completely original TikTok users have noticed a new feature promising ""a whole new creative experience"" - but they've been quick to question how new it really is. The addition, called TikTok Now, released in the UK this week, asks users to take a photo or video from their phone's front and back cameras at a random time of day. TikTok hasencouraged people,externalto ""share their most authentic moments"". But many have pointed out that it looks pretty similar to BeReal. That app, seen as an alternative to the filtered and curated feeds often associated with social media, has grown rapidly since it was launched by a small French company. It's currently ninth in Apple's overall UK App Store downloads chart, compared with TikTok's 14th place. But it has got some catching up to do, with some reports putting its total downloads at about 27 million againstTikTok's estimated three billion,external. There are some subtle differences between TikTok's offering and BeReal's. Both will send users a notification at a random time of day, after which they'll have a limited time to snap a photo. TikTok Now also allows for 10-second videos. BeReal prompts you with the message ""It's time to BeReal"", whereas TikTok has settled on ""It's Time to Now"" for its daily countdown launch. As for sharing your posts, BeReal is restricted by design - photos are only meant to be seen by a small circle of close friends, in line with the app's low-key attitude. TikTok Now offers users the ability to share their posts with the wider world, although it will be limited to friends by default. And younger users will have automatic restrictions placed on their posts. Following TikTok's announcementearlier this year,external, people were quick to point out that the concept behind TikTok Now looked very familiar. Others were more direct, accusing it of ""blatantly copying"" its smaller competitor. Tech experts leapt on the fact that Instagram had been beaten to the launch, afterthe company confirmed last month,externalthat it was testing Candid Challenges, its own BeReal-style feature. And industry analyst Matt Navarra said the announcement by ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, was ""shameless and ferociously fast"". Could my BeReal get me sacked?

For example, Instagram recently rolled back an unpopularTikTok-style revampthat filled people's feeds with videos. Even celebrities like Kim Kardashian and Kylie Jenner weighed in, accusing the app of trying to imitate its rival and urging it to ""make Instagram Instagram again"". And you might remember Fleets - Twitter's ill-fated attempt to introduce disappearing tweets similar to Instagram's Stories features. Or you might not.After a backlash, the company quietly retired the feature after just a few months, saying it hadn't ""seen an increase in the number of new people joining the conversation with Fleets like we hoped"". As for TikTok Now, users in the USA got it first, with the button for the feature replacing the current Friends tab. There are plans to release it as a separate app in some countries.

Turnbull, who hosted BBC Breakfast for 15 years and was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2018,died on 31 August, aged 66. His funeral service was held at the Holy Trinity Church in Blythburgh in Suffolk, where he had lived. His BBC Breakfast co-host Sian Williams said he was ""an extraordinary man"". Turnbull's two sons and son-in-law were among the six pallbearers carrying his oak coffin into the church, which is just off the A12 near Southwold Susanna Reid (left) arrived at the church with Sian Williams, who said it was ""a day of sadness and reflection"" Other broadcasters, including Charlie Stayt, Susanna Reid and Naga Munchetty, were among those at the service. Turnbull's two sons and son-in-law were among the six pallbearers carrying his oak coffin, adorned with a red rose and purple bouquet, into the church. Other famous names who attended included Martha Kearney, Mike Bushell, Louise Minchin, Charlotte Hawkins and Nick Robinson. Turnbull (far left) presented BBC Breakfast with (left to right) Sian Williams, Susanna Reid and Charlie Stayt Naga Munchetty said Turnbull was ""passionate about the audience"" Williams, his friend of 30 years and BBC Breakfast co-host for more than a decade, said: ""Bill was an extraordinary man and I don't think he quite ever realised the impact he had on other people. ""I met somebody just yesterday at the hospital where I work - he was a porter and he said 'I went to get checked [for prostate cancer] because Bill told me to' and that impact has been felt throughout the UK. ""He was a mate, he was a very loyal friend, and he was great to sit next to for 11 years. We trusted one another and respected one another... I'll remember him with a smile, he made me laugh."" Football gantry named after broadcaster Turnbull Bill Turnbull was 'a fan with the mic' Turnbull saved lives, says prostate cancer charity Turnbull hosted BBC Breakfast for 15 years and also fronted Songs of Praise and game show Think Tank. After leaving the BBC in 2016, he joined Classic FM and continued presenting shows on the network until recently.

Broadcasters Martha Kearney and Charlie Stayt were among the former colleagues who also attended Williams added: ""I wish he were able to understand how much he was valued, and I think it is incredible the number of people here who just wanted to come and celebrate and pay their respects to him. ""I think the reason that so many people have turned out today to pay their respects - to think about him and share memories of him and to celebrate him - is because he was a good man."" Robinson, presenter of theToday programme on BBC Radio 4, said he was ""going to miss him terribly"". ""People sometimes say people who present TV shows get paid a vast amount of money, they get a lot of praise and it's easy. And it is easy, but the funny thing is hardly anybody can do it well,"" he said. ""Bill Turnbull did it brilliantly because he was a seriously good journalist, but he also was a human being who could reach out, empathise and be warm with people, from presidents, kings and queens down to people talking about their pets."" Nick Robinson said people may say TV presenting is easy ""but funnily enough I do not know anybody else as good as Bill Turnbull at doing it"" David Kogan, one of Turnbull's former editors, said he was ""as close to me as a brother could be"". ""As a friend he was a very funny companion with whom I went on long trips, we listened to music, we went to football, he was a man who had great depth of personality and character, great depth of friendship and family. He was a great guy,"" he said. ""I've witnessed Bill for the last five years fighting this illness with incredible strength of will, and his family also fighting it with their incredible levels of support, and in the last few weeks of his life, when the battle was clearly being lost, he was a man who was not going to give up life easily.

"Queues are likely at London Underground and train stations on Monday as people travel to see the Queen's funeral. Monday will see one of the UK's biggest transport operations with more than a million people expected to travel to the capital, Transport for London said. Major London train stations are staying open all night, with extra services being put on - some through the night. However, railway lines between Slough and Paddington have been blockeddue to overhead wire damage. The problem is affecting services run by Great Western Railway, Heathrow Express and the Elizabeth Line, and is disrupting travel from Heathrow Airport and Reading into London. Network Rail chairman Sir Peter Hendy has warned that trains will be ""extremely busy"", particularly in London on Monday afternoon and evening following Queen Elizabeth II's state funeral. ""To help us provide the best possible experience and avoid lengthy queues at stations we're asking people not to rush home after the funeral and the processions, but to take their time and experience London on this memorable day,"" he said. Transport staff will be around to help elderly or vulnerable passengers and are advising people to keep an eye on the most up-to-date travel information. On Sunday, footfall at London stations was up 10% from a week earlier, but some stations saw even bigger rises with Waterloo and Charing Cross up by more than 20%. Watch live: Queen Elizabeth II's lying-in-state Heathrow cancels flights on Monday for funeral Andy Byford, commissioner of Transport for London (TfL) said: ""The day of the funeral will be one of the busiest, biggest, challenges TfL has ever faced,"" He said the capital had seen ""huge numbers of additional passengers"" since the Queen died at Balmoral on 8 September, but demand will ""reach a climax"" on Monday. He said: ""We're ready for probably one of the busiest days Transport for London has ever faced...we're preparing for potentially a million people just within the footprint of the royal palaces and Hyde Park."" London train stations including Victoria, Waterloo, Charing Cross and Euston will be open throughout the night across the Bank Holiday weekend. Three Tube stations - Westminster, St James's Park and Hyde Park Corner - will be closed for most of Monday morning to avoid being overcrowded. Some stations will also have stationary ""welfare trains"" so people have somewhere to shelter at all hours. Many shops, restaurants and toilets will remain open in train stations as well. LNER, which is not running ""night trains"", has already announced an Azuma train will be stationed at London King's Cross station all night, with staff on-hand to assist. Avanti is also putting on extra charter services to help ease congestion between Manchester and London. Four extra services will run on Monday. Transport for London has set up a special control centre in Southwark TfL says it will invite customers on its services to observe the two-minute silence at around 11:55 on Monday. TfL says buses will pull over for it, if it is safe and practical to do so, and switch their engines off. The Underground, Overground and other rail services in London will also invite passengers to take part but services will continue to run. As it will be a bank holiday, peak travel restrictions have been lifted. What will be open on the day of the Queen's funeral? Day-by-day guide from now to the funeral Although trains and Tubes have been busy in the past few days, particularly in central London around mourning events, overall passenger usage remains below pre-Covid levels. Many commuters and business people are thought to have stayed away from the city centre. Anyone who bought Anytime, Off-Peak, or Super Off-Peak train tickets can get full refunds during the mourning period if the tickets were bought before the Queen's death was announced. Road closures and diversions are expected to continue for several days after Monday, as event infrastructure is removed, TfL said. National Highways is also warning people to allow extra time travelling in out of London, as motorways and major roads will be very busy. Motorists are advised to avoid central London because of road closures. Motorway service stations will remain open, although there might be reduced levels of services at some locations on Monday. Heathrow Airport has also warned people to take public transport instead of driving to the airport on Monday because of road closures around Windsor. What is open on the day of the Queen's funeral?

"The pound has fallen to a new 37-year low against the US dollar after figures showed UK retail sales fell sharply in August as the rise in the cost of living continued to hit households. The larger-than-expected drop in sales volumes of 1.6% prompted fresh concerns over the state of the economy. Sales across all retail sectors fell in August as households cut back in the face of rising prices. One analyst suggested the figures showed the UK is already in recession. Sterling fell more than 1% against the dollar to $1.1351 at one point, its lowest since 1985, following the release of the retail sales figures. The pound recovered later to climb above $1.14. The pound has been falling against the US currency for most of the year, partly due to the strength of the dollar. A weak pound means Brits travelling overseas will find their spending money will not stretch as far. This comes at a time when UK inflation, which is the rate at which prices rise, is running at a near 40-year high, despite slipping to 9.9% from July's 10.1%. The Bank of England has predicted the UK will fall into recession towards the end of this year and it is expected to keep increasing interest rates in a bid to curb inflation. Tax-cutting mini Budget on Friday next week What is inflation and why are living costs rising? What the new energy plan means for you Olivia Cross, assistant economist at Capital Economics, said August's retail sales figures backed up the consultancy's view that the UK economy is ""already in recession"". A recession is defined by the economy getting smaller for two consecutive three-month periods. ""Retail sales will probably continue to struggle as the cost of living crisis hits harder in the coming months,"" Ms Cross said. ""But nonetheless the Bank of England will still have to raise interest rates aggressively."" Higher prices, along with upcoming energy bill rises in October, have led households to tighten their belts when it comes to spending. The government announced the Energy Price Guarantee last week to help people with energy bills. The support will see annual energy bill for a typical household capped at Â£2,500 for two years. Typical energy bills were set to rise to Â£3,549 a year and even higher in 2023, before the government intervened. Ms Cross, of Capital Economics, said that because of the intervention, any recession would be ""smaller and shorter"" than it had expected previously. Martyn Beck, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said the government support  ""should ease both the income squeeze and lift consumers' sentiment, suggesting the outlook for retailers isn't as gloomy as could have been the case"". ""However, real household incomes are still on course for a significant fall over the next 12 months or so,"" he added. The government is expected to set out the estimated cost of plans to cap energy prices in a ""mini-Budget"" next Friday, as well as tax cuts pledged by Prime Minister Liz Truss in a bid to boost the economy. Sterling's fall to a fresh 37-year low against the dollar today is not isolated. The pound also hit its weakest level against the euro for nearly a year and a half. So while the big picture movement is strength in the US dollar, there continues to be specific additional pressure on the pound sterling in international markets. This morning's trigger was far weaker than expected retail sales figures. But markets await next Friday and the extent of borrowing required for the government's energy plan and tax cuts. The eurozone too is heading for recession, but there is little comfort in such company. The risk is that a weaker currency, makes imports of essentials, from energy to food, more expensive, prolonging the period of high inflation. And if the UK's nearest trading partners are also in recession, exporters will not see significant benefit from a weaker pound. The fall in retail sales continues the slide since the summer of 2021, when all Covid restrictions were removed,the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said,external. The drop seen in August was the largest month-on-month fall since December 2021. Sales of food, online, non-food and fuel all fell in the month, the ONS said. Supermarkets' sales volumes also fell by 0.9% in August, but alcohol and tobacco sales rose by 6.3%. ""Feedback from retailers suggests that consumers are cutting back on spending because of increased prices and affordability concerns,"" the ONS said. Danni Hewson, AJ Bell financial analyst, said people were ""clearly thinking hard about what they spend their money on"". ""It's just not stretching as far as it used to, and essentials have to come first. But even essentials are costing more and with the spectre of unmanageable fuel bills looming large people did the only thing they could, cut back,"" she said. Shoppers are shunning ""big ticket"" purchases, such as washing machines According to the ONS, department stores saw a large drop in sales in August - 2.7% - while sales in clothing shops fell by 0.6%. ""Big ticket purchases are being put off and that's unlikely to change in the coming months,"" said AJ Bell's Ms Hewson. On Thursday, John Lewis revealed that while its shopper numbers were higher than last year,customers were spending less and avoiding buying as many ""big ticket"" items. The department store and its supermarket chain Waitrose reported a loss of Â£99m for the first half of its trading year. Waitrose said it sales were down 5% on last year, with basket sizes shrinking by ""nearly a fifth"". Food prices have been increasing around the world following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which has been one of the main factors pushing up prices at supermarket tills. Meanwhile, the proportion of retail sales online fell to 25.7% in August from 26.3% in July, but the figure remains significantly above pre-pandemic levels.

"Train drivers are set to stage more strikes in October as part of a long-running dispute over pay, the BBC understands. Drivers at 12 train companies are expected to strike on 1 and 5 October. Aslef, the train drivers' union, has not commented on the proposed industrial action out of respect ahead of Queen Elizabeth II's funeral. A strike had been planned for 15 September, but was postponed following the announcement of the Queen's death. Aslef will not be making any public statements or comments on further strike action until Tuesday. But the managing director of rail operator LNER, David Horne,tweeted,externalthat the trade union Aslef had indeed notified it of strike action on Saturday 1 October and Wednesday 5 October. Mr Horne said LNER had already suspended ticket sales for these dates and it would confirm as soon as possible which services will be running. A rail industry source told the BBC that they found it ""incredible"" and ""utterly disrespectful"" that the Aslef leadership announced fresh strike action on Friday. ""This a time when the entire rail family is working hard to support the hundreds of thousands of people who wish to pay their respects to Her Majesty the Queen during this time of national mourning,"" they said. Are we set for a general strike? How the Queen's funeral day will unfold A series of large-scale rail strikes has already happened in recent months, causing disruption for millions, with unions wanting pay increases in line with the rising cost of living. Rail bosses say they want to give workers a pay rise. But they and the government insist changes are needed to ""modernise"" the railway, end some outdated working practices and save money. They argue that with passenger revenue lower than before the pandemic, and after billions of public money kept services going, neither taxpayers nor passengers should have to pay more to cover the funding gap. So higher wages must be funded by reforms. They have also accused unions of a ""total disregard"" for passengers. The latest strike action is expected to affect travel to and from the Conservative party conference, which is due to take place in Birmingham between 2 and 5 October. The London Marathon is also taking place on 2 October. During her campaign, Prime Minister Liz Truss pledged to introduce new restrictions on trade unions, which drew severe criticism from the likes of the Trade Unions' Congress as an ""attack on fundamental British liberty"". One of her proposals included ensuring that a minimum level of service is provided in some sectors, including the railways. Unions currently have to give two weeks' notice of planned strike action.

"The queue to see the Queen lying in state at Westminster Hall is at capacity and has been paused for new joiners, the government has said. But there was confusion as some people said security staff had let them join the line since entry had been stopped. The line is now about five miles (8km) long, stretching to Southwark Park in south-east London. Thousands have paid their respects to the Queen, who is lying in state at Westminster until 06:30 BST on Monday. After the queue grew overnight, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport said at 09:50 that entry to Southwark Park, where the queue officially ends, would be paused for ""at least six hours"". At one stage electronic signs along the route warned those in line that they would be queuing for at least 14 hours. Regular updates on the queue arebeing published on Twitter,external, with a live queue trackeralso available on YouTube,external. A separate queue for people with accessibility needs is also at capacity, the department said. BBC correspondent Frank Gardner said a police inspector has told people waiting to join that queue there would be no wristbands granting entry until at least noon on Saturday. At Southwark Park, some of those initially turned away said they had travelled hundreds of miles and were on their second attempts to access the queue. In a moment of confusion, stewards at the park appeared to allow about 100 people into the park after the pause was announced. This video can not be played Watch: David Beckham's 12-hour wait to see the Queen Jane Sebutinde said she was on her way when she heard the queue would be paused. ""Currently with my health I can't queue for 14 hours, I thought it would be four hours,"" she said. For many of those currently in the main queue, latest estimates suggest they will not enter Westminster Hall until after midnight. The Met Office advised those in the queue to be prepared for ""cool evenings"" with overnight temperatures expected to be as low as 8C (46F). Among those waiting to pay their respects to Her Majesty was former England footballer David Beckham, who was seen queuing in Victoria Tower Gardens. He told the BBC he had been queuing for about 12 hours, having joined at about 02:00, and had been sharing food with those around him. ""We all want to be here together, we all want to experience something where we celebrate the amazing life of our Queen and I think something like this today is meant to be shared together,"" he said. ""So the fact we've been here, we're eating Pringles, sherbet lemons, sandwiches, having coffee, donuts as well."" When asked how he was managing, the ex-England captain said his knees were okay but ""it's the back and the feet"" that were feeling the effects of 12 hours of queuing. One woman who was queuing behind him spoke of her shock at seeing the former Manchester United and Real Madrid star waiting alongside members of the public. ""Big respect to him, he's stood with us and he's paid his respects how he wants to and I think that's amazing."" Later, Beckham appeared solemn as he entered Westminster Hall to pay his respects. He had to wait for the changing of the guard to take place before he filed past the Queen's coffin and bowed.

Ambulance teams have treated 435 members of the public along the route of the queue over the past two days, London Ambulance Service said, with 42 of those requiring hospital treatment. The majority of incidents were faints and collapses resulting in head injuries, the service said. A man has appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Courtafter two women were allegedly sexually assaultedin the queue to attend the Queen's lying-in-state. Meanwhile,a row has broken out over who is allowed to skip the queueto pay their respects to the late Queen after it emerged MPs and Lords had special access. The announcement of the queue's pause came shortly after it was confirmed Queen Elizabeth II's grandchildren would holda 15-minute vigil at Westminster Hall on Saturday evening. The Prince of Wales and the Duke of Sussex will observe the vigil alongside six of their cousins. The royal brothers will both wear military attire for the occasion, after a request from their father, King Charles. The King and his siblings, the Princess Royal, the Duke of York and the Earl of Wessex, will hold a similar vigil on Friday evening. King Charles is in Wales forhis first official visit as monarch. The former Prince of Wales and Camilla, the new Queen Consort, attended a prayer and reflection service for the Queen at Cardiff's Llandaff Cathedral and met members of the public at Cardiff Castle.

"The queue to see the Queen lying in state at Westminster Hall has reopened after entry was officially paused for seven hours, the government has said. But mourners have been warned to expect waiting times of at least 19-and-a-half hours and cold overnight temperatures. Despite the official statement people told the BBC they had managed to join the queue throughout the day. The line is now about five miles (8km) long, stretching to Southwark Park in south-east London. Thousands have paid their respects to the Queen, who is lying in state at Westminster until 06:30 BST on Monday. A separate queue for people with accessibility needs has been paused until midday on Saturday, the government said. The Department for Digital, Media, Culture and Sport (DCMS) had said entrance to the main queue had been paused around 10:00 this morning after it had grown on Thursday and overnight into Friday. However, people locally said the park and entrance to the line were only closed for around 30 minutes, with another queue then forming outside the park before the gates were soon reopened. At 17:05 the government announced that entry to the queue, at Southwark Park, had been resumed. The government has said entry could be closed again should capacity be reached once more. Regular updates arebeing published on Twitter,external, with a live queue trackeralso available on YouTube,external. The Met Office has said overnight temperatures were expected to be as low as 8C (46F) and the government has said warm clothing is recommended. On Friday evening all entry slots had been allocated for the queue for people with accessibility needs, the DCMS said. ""For everyone's comfort, please do not attempt to join the accessible queue before midday tomorrow,"" the department said. Earlier, Andrea, who is disabled and joined the queue with her mother, told BBC Radio 5 Live they had been abruptly told to ""go home because we're not going to let anybody else through"". ""We tried to speak to some of the stewards, and they were very nice but they just kept repeating the mantra that we had to return home and that they weren't going to let anybody else come in to get a timed slot,"" she said - adding she thought people had joined the line for people with accessibility needs after the closure of the main queue. ""I find it a bit ironic that the main queue is allowed to go on, it's just been temporarily suspended, but we've been told to go home and come back the next day - when we're disabled,"" she said.

"Facebook groups are using the carrot emoji to hide anti-vax content from automated moderation tools. The BBC has seen several groups, one with hundreds of thousands of members, in which the emoji appears in place of the word ""vaccine"". Facebook's algorithms tend to focus on words rather than images. The groups are being used to share unverified claims of people being either injured or killed by vaccines. Once the BBC alerted Facebook's parent company, Meta, the groups were removed. ""We have removed this group for violating our harmful misinformation policies and will review any other similar content in line with this policy. We continue to work closely with public health experts and the UK government to further tackle Covid vaccine misinformation,"" the firm said in a statement. However, the groups have since re-appeared in our searches. One group we saw has been around for three years but rebranded itself to focus on vaccine stories, from being a group for sharing ""banter, bets and funny videos"" in August 2022. The rules of the very large group state: ""Use code words for everything"". It adds: ""Do not use the c word, v word or b word ever"" (covid, vaccine, booster). It was created more than a year ago and has more than 250,000 members. Marc Owen-Jones, a disinformation researcher, and associate professor at Hamad Bin Khalifa University in Qatar, was invited to join it. ""It was people giving accounts of relatives who had died shortly after having the Covid-19 vaccine"", he said. ""But instead of using the words ""Covid-19"" or ""vaccine"", they were using emojis of carrots. ""Initially I was a little confused. And then it clicked - that it was being used as a way of evading, or apparently evading, Facebook's fake news detection algorithms."" Allow Twitter content?

"Turnbull presented BBC Breakfast for 15 years, and later moved to the commercial radio station Classic FM Friends and colleagues of former BBC broadcaster Bill Turnbull have paid tribute to him at his funeral service. Turnbull, who hosted BBC Breakfast for 15 years and was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2018,died on 31 August, aged 66. His funeral service was held at the Holy Trinity Church in Blythburgh in Suffolk, where he had lived. His BBC Breakfast co-host Sian Williams said he was ""an extraordinary man"". Turnbull's two sons and son-in-law were among the six pallbearers carrying his oak coffin into the church, which is just off the A12 near Southwold Susanna Reid (left) arrived at the church with Sian Williams, who said it was ""a day of sadness and reflection"" Other broadcasters, including Charlie Stayt, Susanna Reid and Naga Munchetty, were among those at the service. Turnbull's two sons and son-in-law were among the six pallbearers carrying his oak coffin, adorned with a red rose and purple bouquet, into the church. Other famous names who attended included Martha Kearney, Mike Bushell, Louise Minchin, Charlotte Hawkins and Nick Robinson. Turnbull (far left) presented BBC Breakfast with (left to right) Sian Williams, Susanna Reid and Charlie Stayt Naga Munchetty said Turnbull was ""passionate about the audience"" Williams, his friend of 30 years and BBC Breakfast co-host for more than a decade, said: ""Bill was an extraordinary man and I don't think he quite ever realised the impact he had on other people. ""I met somebody just yesterday at the hospital where I work - he was a porter and he said 'I went to get checked [for prostate cancer] because Bill told me to' and that impact has been felt throughout the UK. ""He was a mate, he was a very loyal friend, and he was great to sit next to for 11 years. We trusted one another and respected one another... I'll remember him with a smile, he made me laugh."" Football gantry named after broadcaster Turnbull Bill Turnbull was 'a fan with the mic' Turnbull saved lives, says prostate cancer charity Turnbull hosted BBC Breakfast for 15 years and also fronted Songs of Praise and game show Think Tank. After leaving the BBC in 2016, he joined Classic FM and continued presenting shows on the network until recently. Bill Turnbull was a regular fixture at Adams Park where he had been a fan of Wycombe Wanderers for more than 20 years Wycombe Wanderers' manager Gareth Ainsworth attended the funeral A signed Wycombe Wanderers shirt with the number 60 had been placed on a bench outside the church to mark Turnbull's support for the football club. Current BBC Breakfast presenter Naga Munchetty, who shared the red sofa with Turnbull for several years, said: ""He was passionate about the job and passionate about the journalism and passionate about the audience.

She added that she would remember Turnbull as a ""funny, charming, cheeky guy"". Broadcasters Martha Kearney and Charlie Stayt were among the former colleagues who also attended Williams added: ""I wish he were able to understand how much he was valued, and I think it is incredible the number of people here who just wanted to come and celebrate and pay their respects to him. ""I think the reason that so many people have turned out today to pay their respects - to think about him and share memories of him and to celebrate him - is because he was a good man."" Robinson, presenter of theToday programme on BBC Radio 4, said he was ""going to miss him terribly"". ""People sometimes say people who present TV shows get paid a vast amount of money, they get a lot of praise and it's easy. And it is easy, but the funny thing is hardly anybody can do it well,"" he said. ""Bill Turnbull did it brilliantly because he was a seriously good journalist, but he also was a human being who could reach out, empathise and be warm with people, from presidents, kings and queens down to people talking about their pets."" Nick Robinson said people may say TV presenting is easy ""but funnily enough I do not know anybody else as good as Bill Turnbull at doing it"" David Kogan, one of Turnbull's former editors, said he was ""as close to me as a brother could be"". ""As a friend he was a very funny companion with whom I went on long trips, we listened to music, we went to football, he was a man who had great depth of personality and character, great depth of friendship and family. He was a great guy,"" he said. ""I've witnessed Bill for the last five years fighting this illness with incredible strength of will, and his family also fighting it with their incredible levels of support, and in the last few weeks of his life, when the battle was clearly being lost, he was a man who was not going to give up life easily.

"This BeReally familiar: TikTok Now is billed as a ""new way to connect"" but people are pointing out the idea isn't completely original TikTok users have noticed a new feature promising ""a whole new creative experience"" - but they've been quick to question how new it really is. The addition, called TikTok Now, released in the UK this week, asks users to take a photo or video from their phone's front and back cameras at a random time of day. TikTok hasencouraged people,externalto ""share their most authentic moments"". But many have pointed out that it looks pretty similar to BeReal. That app, seen as an alternative to the filtered and curated feeds often associated with social media, has grown rapidly since it was launched by a small French company. It's currently ninth in Apple's overall UK App Store downloads chart, compared with TikTok's 14th place. But it has got some catching up to do, with some reports putting its total downloads at about 27 million againstTikTok's estimated three billion,external. There are some subtle differences between TikTok's offering and BeReal's. Both will send users a notification at a random time of day, after which they'll have a limited time to snap a photo. TikTok Now also allows for 10-second videos. BeReal prompts you with the message ""It's time to BeReal"", whereas TikTok has settled on ""It's Time to Now"" for its daily countdown launch. As for sharing your posts, BeReal is restricted by design - photos are only meant to be seen by a small circle of close friends, in line with the app's low-key attitude. TikTok Now offers users the ability to share their posts with the wider world, although it will be limited to friends by default. And younger users will have automatic restrictions placed on their posts. Following TikTok's announcementearlier this year,external, people were quick to point out that the concept behind TikTok Now looked very familiar. Others were more direct, accusing it of ""blatantly copying"" its smaller competitor. Tech experts leapt on the fact that Instagram had been beaten to the launch, afterthe company confirmed last month,externalthat it was testing Candid Challenges, its own BeReal-style feature. And industry analyst Matt Navarra said the announcement by ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, was ""shameless and ferociously fast"". Could my BeReal get me sacked?

For example, Instagram recently rolled back an unpopularTikTok-style revampthat filled people's feeds with videos. Even celebrities like Kim Kardashian and Kylie Jenner weighed in, accusing the app of trying to imitate its rival and urging it to ""make Instagram Instagram again"". And you might remember Fleets - Twitter's ill-fated attempt to introduce disappearing tweets similar to Instagram's Stories features. Or you might not.After a backlash, the company quietly retired the feature after just a few months, saying it hadn't ""seen an increase in the number of new people joining the conversation with Fleets like we hoped"". As for TikTok Now, users in the USA got it first, with the button for the feature replacing the current Friends tab. There are plans to release it as a separate app in some countries.

"Alex Belfield was convicted of four charges following a trial at Nottingham Crown Court A former BBC radio presenter found guilty of stalking four people including broadcaster Jeremy Vine has been jailed for five and a half years. Alex Belfield, who now runs a YouTube channel, stalked his victims by harassing them online. His trial heard he made YouTube videos about them, posted messages on social media, sent emails, and also encouraged his followers to target them. The judge said one of his victims came close to killing himself. Belfield had harassed this victim, BBC Radio Northampton presenter Bernard Spedding, for nine years and some of his followers had sent him death threats. ""He was seconds away from taking his own life as a result of your conduct,"" the judge, Mr Justice Saini, told Belfield. ""You made this highly successful and confident radio presenter lose all joy in life and turned him into a shell."" The judge said that while Belfield did not physically approach or watch his victims, the effects were just as damaging. ""The stalking you committed was not the conventional type which is popularised in the press,"" he said. ""Your methods were, however, just as effective as a way of intimidating your victims, and were in many ways much harder to deal with."" The judge said he agreed with some of the witnesses in the case, who said Belfield had ""weaponised the internet"". Belfield was found guilty of ""simple"" stalking in relation to BBC presenter Jeremy Vine Belfield, who is 42 and from Nottingham, was originally charged with stalking eight different people, who were mostly current or former BBC staff. The full wording of the charges stated he ""pursued a course of conduct that amounted to harassment"" of the complainants, which ""amounted to stalking"" and caused them ""serious alarm or distress"". He was found guilty of this offence in relation to two of the complainants - Mr Spedding, who is known as Bernie Keith, and videographer Ben Hewis. For each of these charges he was sentenced to two and a half years in prison, to run consecutively. The judge said Belfield ""bombarded"" Mr Spedding - who had previously been friends with Belfield - with Facebook messages and emails, and made ""highly abusive"" YouTube videos containing false allegations. ""He had no escape from you,"" the judge told Belfield. The judge said it was an aggravating factor that Belfield's harassment was public, as this caused his social media followers to also abuse Mr Spedding over a ""lengthy period"". ""In some cases this has extended to death threats,"" he said. Belfield was previously a presenter at BBC Radio Leeds Victim personal statements were not read out in court, but Mr Hewis tweeted his after the sentencing. ""From his very first email and in the majority of communications thereafter, he used my wife and children as his main weapon to terrify, intimidate and blackmail me,"" he wrote. ""Blocking was also a futile exercise as Belfield continued to seek out new ways to get to me when others failed. When blocked on Twitter he used other accounts to see what I was tweeting and routinely publicly mocked me to his social media followers, posting screengrabs he could only have obtained by using an account that I hadn't blocked."" In relation to Jeremy Vine and theatre blogger Philip Dehany, Belfield was found guilty of two lesser offences of ""simple"" stalking, which does not require serious alarm or distress to be proved. For each of these offences he was sentenced to 13 weeks, also to run consecutively. The judge said Belfield had made ""wholly false"" allegations about Mr Vine stealing Â£1,000 of BBC licence payers' money, in a video which was viewed by more than 400,000 people. ""You were not a whistleblower in any sense but developed a fixation with pursuing Mr Vine with a campaign of abuse,"" the judge said. Belfield also published Mr Vine's address to a ""mass audience"", the judge said. ""Although you at no stage committed any physical acts, Mr Vine considered himself and his family to be at risk from you and his followers,"" the judge told Belfield. ""He had to ask his family to watch out for you and to take care in and around their home address."" Belfield made videos throughout his trial and posted them on YouTube Belfield was found not guilty of stalking Rozina Breen, Liz Green, Helen Thomas and Stephanie Hirst. Ms Breen had been his boss at BBC Radio Leeds, Ms Green had been a fellow radio presenter, Ms Thomas had been Ms Breen's boss, and Ms Hirst joined BBC Radio Leeds as a presenter after Belfield left. The judge made restraining orders in relation to all of the complainants, including those Belfield was not convicted of stalking. In relation to the women, the judge said: ""Each of them suffered a campaign of harassment by email and social media communications. Each of them suffered serious mental health problems arising from Mr Belfield's conduct."" The judge explained he did not question the verdicts of the jurors, but was applying the civil standard of proof when making the restraining orders. Ms Breen tweeted that she was glad to finally have justice after 10 years. ""Despite four women not securing guilty verdicts, today's custodial sentences are a welcome relief,"" she wrote. ""Stalking is a crime. Horrific, vicious, cowardly."" The verdicts in relation to each complainant, in the order they appeared on the indictment, were: Rozina Breen - not guilty Liz Green - not guilty Helen Thomas - not guilty Stephanie Hirst - not guilty Bernard Spedding - guilty (majority verdict) Ben Hewis - guilty (unanimous verdict) Philip Dehany - not guilty to the charge on the indictment but guilty of the alternative charge of ""simple"" stalking (majority verdict) Jeremy Vine - not guilty to the charge on the indictment but guilty of the alternative charge of ""simple"" stalking (unanimous verdict) In mitigation, barrister David Aubrey KC said Belfield had not intended to cause his victims distress, but could now see that he had. ""He now has developed the insight that he didn't have before,"" Mr Aubrey said. ""He said he could see their distress in court and feels deeply sorry for what he did."" The judge told Belfield he will serve up to half of his sentence in prison and the remainder on licence. He warned him he could then be recalled to prison if he commits a further offence.

"A planned meeting between Liz Truss and US President Joe Biden before the Queen's funeral has been cancelled, Downing Street has said. No 10 said a ""full bilateral meeting"" between the PM and Mr Biden would instead take place at the UN General Assembly on Wednesday. It is thought holding the talks after the period of national mourning would allow more wide-ranging discussions. Ms Truss met her counterparts from New Zealand and Australia on Saturday. The prime minister held informal talks with Jacinda Ardern and Australian premier Anthony Albanese at Chevening House in Kent. And Number 10 confirmed Ms Truss will see Irish Taoiseach [prime minister] MicheÃ¡l Martin, Canadian PM Justin Trudeau, and Polish President Andrzej Duda at Downing Street on Sunday. Although she met Mr Biden when she was foreign secretary, next week's UN meeting with him in New York will be Ms Truss's first as UK prime minister. How the Queen's funeral day will unfold Who's invited to the Queen's funeral - and who's not? Mammoth task of organising '100 state visits at once' Monday's funeral will be one of the biggest diplomatic events of recent years, with some 500 heads of state and foreign dignitaries expected to attend. It is providing Ms Truss with an opportunity to meet foreign counterparts less than two weeks after taking office. But Downing Street had stressed that talks this weekend would not be formal bilateral meetings because of the official 10-day mourning period following the death of the Queen. It would not be issuing summaries of the discussions as would normally happen after the PM's meetings with foreign leaders, No 10 added. As a former foreign secretary, Liz Truss is not exactly new to rubbing shoulders with world leaders. She'll see a lot of them over this weekend. Meeting them as prime minister, though, is different and the first meeting with the US president is always the biggest for a new PM. When Liz Truss and Joe Biden do sit down, it will be closely scrutinised for any indications of the health, or otherwise, of the ""special relationship"". I'm told that holding it after the official mourning period means it can be much more focused on business rather than reflecting on the Queen. There is a lot of business to tackle. Joe Biden is no fan of Liz Truss's approach to the Northern Ireland Protocol, for a start. The US has suggested it is ""not conducive"" to the other not-so-small matter of a trade deal. All this will have to wait though, until later in the week. In advance of her talks with Ms Truss, Ms Ardern said the death of the Queen would be the ""focus of conversation"", and they were also likely to discuss Ukraine and the UK'sfree trade agreement with New Zealand.announced last October. It was thought the meeting between Ms Truss and Mr Albanese focused on trade, after thesigning of a deal between the UK and Australia in December. Ms Truss also held a phone call with the President of the UAE, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al Nahyan, on Saturday in which he expressed his condolences on the death of the Queen. The meeting with the Irish Republic's prime minister comes at a time of strained relations with the EU over post-Brexit checks in Northern Ireland. The UK is refusing to apply some of the checks it signed up to in the Brexit withdrawal deal, prompting aseries of lawsuits from the EU. Liz Truss met Joe Biden in Glasgow last November, when he attended the COP 26 climate summit Mr Martin has expressed concern about legislation Ms Truss introduced as foreign secretary enabling the UK to alter the legal commitments it signed up to in the exit treaty in 2019. Ms Truss is expected to meet European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen for talks at the UN meeting in New York next week. The state funeral service in Westminster Abbey on Monday is expected to be attended by hundreds of foreign dignitaries, including politicians and royalty. Syria, Venezuela, Afghanistan, Myanmar, Russia and Belarus have not been invited - whilst Iran, North Korea and Nicaragua have been asked to only send a senior diplomat. China's President Xi Jinping is on the guest list for the funeral ceremony but is not thought likely to attend. A Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman said on Friday that no decision had been made on whether they would be sending a delegation, although press reports have suggested China's vice-president will attend. Ms Truss is expected to have a phone call with the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed Bin Salman on Saturday evening. The de factoruler's invitation to the Queen's funeral has sparked protestsfrom human rights campaigners. A declassified CIA report concluded that he had authorised the murder and dismemberment of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi - allegations denied by the crown prince.

"Police denied eyewitness reports that Mahsa Amini had been beaten A 22-year-old Iranian woman has died days after being arrested by morality police for allegedly not complying with strict rules on head coverings. Eyewitnesses said Mahsa Amini was beaten while inside a police van when she was picked up in Tehran on Tuesday. Police have denied the allegations, saying Ms Amini had ""suddenly suffered a heart problem"". It is the latest in a series of reports of brutality against women by authorities in Iran in recent weeks. Ms Amini's family say that she was a healthy young woman with no medical conditions that would explain a sudden heart problem. However, they were informed she had been taken to hospital a few hours after her arrest and the family said she had been in a coma before she died on Friday. Tehran police said Ms Amini had been arrested for ""justification and education"" about the hijab, the headscarf which is mandatory for all women to wear. Her death comes in the wake of growing reports of repressive acts against women, including those judged not to be complying with Islamic dress code being barred from entering government offices and banks. Many Iranians, including pro-government individuals, are expressing their outrage on social media platforms regarding the very existence of the morality police, also known as Guidance Patrols, and are using hashtags that translate as Murder Patrols. Videos have emerged on social media appearing to show officers detaining women, dragging them on the ground, and forcefully whisking them away. Many Iranians blame the Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, directly.  An old speech of his is being reshared on social media in which he justifies the role of the morality police and insists that under Islamic rule, women must be forced to observe the Islamic dress code. The latest episode will only deepen the divide between a large part of Iran's young and vibrant society and its radical rulers, a rift that seems ever harder to mend. Iran's headscarf video sparks mixed reaction Iranian women threw off the hijab - then what? The Girls of Revolution Street.

Paul Bone said there remained a hole in his heart over his daughter's death ""which you can never actually fill"". The unarmed officers were shot and attacked with a grenade while responding to what was believed to be a routine burglary report in Mottram, Tameside. Dale Cregan, who lured them to their deaths while on the run from police for previous killings,received a whole life jail termin June 2013 after admitting their murders. Both fathers toldBBC North West Tonightthat they still struggled to come to terms with what happened. ""A hole in your heart is there,"" Mr Bone said. ""You can never actually fill it but you sort of get used to it."" ""[There's] no way you can forget what happened and forget your own daughter. ""You always miss her."" Mr Hughes added that ""as a family, there is no moving on"", adding: ""But I don't think you want to move on."" Bryn Hughes and Paul Bone have opened up about the grief they shared Since their daughters' deaths, the fathers have campaigned for their sacrifice to be officially recognised and Mr Hughes has launched a bid for the Elizabeth Cross medal to be given posthumously to emergency services workers killed in the line of duty. The medal, first awarded in 2009, is currently given to relatives of members of the armed forces who have been killed in action since the end of World War Two or as a result of a terrorist attack. Mr Hughes, who set up the PC Nicola Hughes Memorial Fund to help those dealing with grief due to violent crime, said it ""keeps her legacy alive"". ""I don't need anything to keep her memory alive as her memories are with me,"" he said. ""But it keeps her legacy and Fiona's. It's important we don't forget the sacrifice they made.""

""You could quite easily withdraw into yourself and become a recluse and I know for a fact Nicola wouldn't want that,"" he said. A service will be held at the Nicola and Fiona memorial garden at Hyde Police Station at 10:40 BST on Sunday, which will include a minute's silence. Ch Supt Phil Davies said although 10 years had passed since the officers' deaths, the ""emotion and grief is still felt on anniversaries such as this and reminds us of the dangerous situations officers face on a daily basis"". ""On Sunday, we will come together with Nicola and Fiona's families and honoured guests, to reflect on the passing of a decade since they made the ultimate sacrifice for the oath they took as police officers,"" he added.

"This video can not be played King Charles III speaks in Welsh in a historic moment for a monarch King Charles III said Wales held a ""special place"" in the Queen's heart as he gave a speech in Welsh on his first visit as the new monarch. He addressed members of the Welsh Parliament in a remembrance event at the Senedd as part of the King and Queen Consort's tour of the UK nations. In a bilingual speech, King Charles gave the Senedd his ""heartfelt thanks for your kind words"". He added that it had been a ""privilege to be Prince of Wales for so long"". The King said Prince William, who was appointed Prince of Wales last week, had a ""deep love"" for the nation. He said the ""ancient title"" dated to the time ""of those great Welsh rulers likeLlywelyn ap Gruffydd, whose memory is still rightly honoured"". Live: Thousands queue to pay respects to Queen In pictures: King's first Wales visit as monarch The Wales-loving prince who is now King ThankingMembers of the Seneddfor their condolences followingthe death of the Queenat the age of 96 last week, the King said that ""through all the years of her reign the land of Wales could not have been closer to my mother's heart"". King Charles III meets schoolchildren and the rest of the crowds outside Llandaff Cathedral on his first visit to Wales as a monarch ""Roedd lle arbenig i Gymru yn ei chalon,"" he said, which translates as ""Wales had a special place in her heart"". ""Fel fy mam annwyl o'm blaen, rwy'n gwybod ein bod ni oll yn caru'r wlad arbennig hon,"" he added, which translates as ""like my beloved mother before me, I know we all share a love for this special land"". As Prince of Wales, Charles often delivered passages of speeches in Welsh - including at the first official opening of what was then called the assembly, in 1999. He told the Senedd it had been a ""privilege to be Prince of Wales for so long"" He added in English: ""I know she took immense pride in your many great achievements, even as she also felt with you deeply in time of sorrow. ""It must surely be counted the greatest privilege to belong to a land that could inspire such devotion.

First Minister Mark Drakeford said in his audience with the King on Friday, King Charles spoke of his concern about how people in Wales would cope in the coming months with the cost of living crisis. Mr Drakeford told Talk TV: ""He is concerned as to how people will manage through what is going to be a difficult winter. ""He was interested to tell me about some of the projects that he has heard of, or become involved in dealing, for example, with food waste, making sure that we don't waste a precious resource when some people might be going without."" Hundreds of well wishers greeted the royal couple in Cardiff Bay, where they also met Welsh Youth Parliament members who told them about their work The last reigning monarch to visit Wales was Queen Elizabeth II when she officially opened the sixth Senedd term in October 2021 King Charles had Welsh lessons at Aberystwyth University beforehis investiture at Caernarfon Castle in 1969. His tutor was the academic Tedi Millward, a Welsh nationalist campaigner. After Dr Millward's death in 2020, the then-Prince Charles paid tribute to him, but admitted he may not have been his finest pupil. Elin Jones, the presiding officer of the Welsh Parliament, said the use of Welsh in the King's speech to the Senedd, was ""hugely significant"". The Llywydd said it ""shows the world that Wales has two languages"". ""It's used by the King and used by the people on the streets as well, and that's a significant moment,"" she told BBC Wales. This video can not be played The King went to Llandaff Cathedral, the Senedd and a reception at Cardiff Castle Analysis by David Deans, BBC Wales political reporter King Charles III's speech in the Senedd was a historic step for a British monarch. While his mother Elizabeth spoke small phrases in the Welsh language, the King's speech on Friday was bilingual, switched from English to Welsh throughout. It was a mark of respect by the monarch for the culture of Wales, in the similar way that the entire visit was recognition of the place the Welsh Parliament and government have in the UK constitution. This video can not be played King Charles III was the longest serving Prince of Wales before he became monarch Both are important in the context of a language which activists had fought in the past to protect, and institutions that had a rocky few early years at the dawn of devolution 23 years ago. It is unlikely to be enough to change views on the monarchy, like those held by the protesters outside Cardiff Castle on Friday. However, there have been few expressions of republicanism in this period of mourning from senior figures in Welsh public life. That is despite the personal views of First Minister Mark Drakeford and Senedd Presiding Officer Elin Jones - both republicans who have taken a full part in this week's proceedings. King Charles arrived in Cardiff via helicopter from his Gloucestershire home of Highgrove following a day of rest after a week of duties since the death of the Queen. He and the Queen Consort were greeted by a gun salute at Cardiff Castle as they set foot on to Welsh soil. This video can not be played A gun salute takes place at Cardiff Castle to honour new king Hundreds of people lined the streets of Llandaff to greet the King and Queen Consort with cheers and flag waving on their way to a prayer and reflection service for the Queen at the Llandaf Cathedral. A fanfare of trumpeters from the Regimental Band of the Royal Welsh greeted the King at the cathedral's west door before Mr Drakeford gave a reading from the Old Testament. King Charles III and the Queen Consort sang a number of hymns during the service, including traditional Welsh song Cwm Rhondda Archbishop of Wales, the Most Rev Andrew John, delivered an address to the congregation - which included Prime Minister Liz Truss in her first visit to Wales as prime minister - in both English and Welsh. Paying tribute to her ""extraordinary legacy of service and devotion"", the archbishop said the Queen had transformed the monarchy and provided a reassuring constancy through the decades. Prime Minister Liz Truss is greeted by Dean of Llandaff Cathedral Michael Komor on her arrival The archbishop said the late Queen's skilful use of ""soft power"" came to the fore during her visits to Aberfan after the disaster there in 1966 when the community found her presence ""deeply consoling"". The hour-long service included hymns Pantyfedwen (Tydi A Wnaeth Y Wyrth), God is Love Let Heaven Adore Him and Cwm Rhondda and their visit to Llandaff ended with King Charles and the Queen Consort meeting schoolchildren in the crowd as they left the cathedral.

The royal couple met military personnel and faith leaders there, while Aberfan Wives group were also among those invited. Denise Morgan and Gloria Davies said the Queen had made a ""bond"" with the mining village after the disaster, when116 children and 28 adults killedwhere killed when a colliery spoil tip collapsed, catastrophically engulfing a primary school and surrounding houses. The Band of the Royal Welsh, joined by military goat Lance Corporal Shenkin IV, played the national anthem Ms Morgan said the Queen's visit to the village eight days after the tragedy was ""at the right time"", adding: ""I don't think she came as the Queen, I think she came as a mother too. ""Because she looked around and she could see the devastation and the look on people's faces."" Ms Morgan said she believed the King would ""continue that bond with Aberfan and the people of Aberfan"". The Band of the Royal Welsh played the national anthem as the royal couple made their way to the front of the castle, with military goat Lance Corporal Shenkin IV stationed at the front. After cries of ""God save the King"", the King smiled and waved before heading into the castle for an audience with Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford.

"A row has broken out over who is allowed to skip the queue to pay their respects to the late Queen. MPs and members of the House of Lords do not have to queue and can take four guests each to the lying-in-state. The majority of Parliamentary staff can also avoid the queues - but people working for MPs must stand in line. Cleaners and security guards employed by contractors in Parliament must also queue - prompting claims they are being treated as ""second class citizens"". There are hundreds of cleaners working across the Parliamentary estate. An estimated 160 of their jobs have been outsourced. Because they don't work directly for the parliamentary administration, they will not be entitled to gain access to the fast track queue. The PCS trade union said it was ""time for them to be treated as equals"". Shortly before 10:00 on Friday, the government announced the public queue was being paused for at least six hours after reaching capacity. Watch: Queen Elizabeth II's lying-in-state Follow latest developments as queue paused Chinese delegation banned from lying-in-state My 30-hour wait to see Queen's coffin The official estimate for queuing time had risen to at least 14 hours. At 17:05, the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said entry to the queue in Southwark Park had reopened. But it addedin a tweet,externalthat the expected queueing time for mourners was now over 24 hours and that temperatures overnight were likely to be cold. Former prime minister Theresa May, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace and deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner are among the MPs who have attended the lying-in-state at Westminster Hall. Members of the public are able to attend 24-hours a day until 06:30 BST on Monday - the day of the Queen's funeral - but the queue will close before then to ensure as many people as possible can get in. Many have waited more than eight hours for the opportunity to pay their respects. Mark Serwotka, general secretary of the PCS union, which represents civil and public servants as well as private sector workers on government contracts, said: ""It's symbolic that hard-working security guards, cleaners and catering staff in Parliament are treated as second-class citizens. ""As we usher in a new era, it's time for them to be treated as equals and at least given a pay rise to help them through the cost-of-living crisis and beyond."" Those who work for MPs or peers must also queue with the public to attend the lying-in-state. One MP staff member said many were upset by this, adding: ""We've seen in the parliamentary response to a succession of scandals involving the bullying and sexual harassment of MPs' staff that we are treated as an after-thought, and this is yet another example.'' According to an internal House of Commons memo,leaked to The Spectator,external, MPs' staff have been told that ""it is not possible to open up access further without the risk of impacting access for queuing members of the public"". Some of the members of the public who had waited for several hours to pay their respects were infuriated by the fact MPs and peers were allowed to take four guests with them when they skipped the public queue. ""Personally, I think it's outrageous,"" said Christina from Balham in south London. ''I can understand that for security reasons MPs might not want to stand in the public queue but they shouldn't be able to take four guests in and neither should the peers."" Louise, from Keston in south-east London, also said she felt this was unfair, adding: ""This day is supposed to be for the people."" But other people who had just emerged from Westminster Hall did not mind. ""I'm not bothered, it's one of the perks of their job,'' said Alan, from Kent. He and his wife Sue were pleased to have progressed along the queue in five hours. Alan and Sally Prince from London also said they ''weren't fussed'', in part because they had really enjoyed being in the queue. ""The atmosphere was fun. It felt like the nation was coming together,"" they said. Former England football captain David Beckham arrived at Westminster Hall on Friday afternoon after queuing for more than 12 hours. Speaking outside, he said: ""It is emotional for everybody involved. Her Majesty was someone special and will be missed just by everyone."" Figures from the London Ambulance Service (LAS) show 435 members of the public were treated along the route of the queue on Wednesday and Thursday. A total of 42 were taken to hospital. The LAS said the majority of people involved had fainted or collapsed, resulting in head injuries. The BBC is live streaming as people file pastso that those unable to make it to London are able to pay their respects at home. How long was the queue to see the Queen's coffin?

"Tens of thousands of passengers are set to be affected by a French air traffic control strike on Friday. Ryanair has cancelled 420 flights, most of which were scheduled to fly over France, affecting 80,000 passengers. EasyJet has cut 76 flights, British Airways has cancelled 22, while Air France said it would only run 45% of its short-haul flights. Separately, on Monday 15% of Heathrow Airport's schedule will be altered during Queen Elizabeth's state funeral. To ensure the skies over London fall quiet during the events, there will be flight cancellations, including 100 British Airways flights and four Virgin Atlantic flights. The strike action in France is being taken by the SNCTA air traffic control union in a row over wages, as inflation soars, and recruitment. Ryanair says all passengers affected have been notified. The low-cost carrier normally operates more than 3,000 flights per day. Neal McMahon, Ryanair operations director, said it was ""inexplicable"" that thousands of European citizens and visitors ""will have their travel plans unfairly disrupted"". ""It is inexcusable that passengers who are not even flying to or from France are disrupted,"" he said. He said French laws protect French domestic flights, but not ones flying over the country. ""It is time that the European Union step in and protect overflights so that European passengers are not repeatedly held to ransom by a tiny French air traffic control union,"" he said. Budget rival EasyJet said it had cancelled flights at the request of French authorities. EasyJet said: ""While this is outside of our control, we would like to apologise to our customers for any inconvenience they may experience."" British Airways said along with the 22 cancelled flights to and from Heathrow, there could be some extra delays on Friday. Air France is only running 45% of its short and medium-haul flights, and 90% of long-haul. It has also warned that delays and last-minute cancellations cannot be ruled out. The flight cuts affect the whole of France, the French civil aviation authority DGAC said. It added that it was currently working with the European air travel regulator Eurocontrol to help airlines avoid the country's air space. Strikes across the aviation industry caused severe disruption to Europe's summer traffic, including ground and cabin personnel, who are seeking pay rises to cope with increased living costs amid high inflation. In July, several strikes by firefighters and staff at Paris's Charles De Gaulle airport led to cancellations and delays. Separately, Heathrow Airport said Monday's flight schedule would change during the Queen's funeral. Heathrow said that all take-offs and landings on Monday will be delayed for 15 minutes before and after the two-minute silence at the end of the funeral. Bus strikes called off after Queen's death Strike action cancelled after the Queen's death Following that, there will be no arrivals between 13:45 and 14:20 during the procession of the hearse, and no departures between 15:03 and 16:45 for the ceremonial procession via the Long Walk to Windsor Castle. Between 16:45 and 21:00, departures will be reduced to support the committal service at St George's Chapel. Flights will also be diverted around Windsor Castle ""to minimise noise during the private family service and interment"", it said. The Civil Aviation Authority has issued guidance which means that air passengers whose flights are cancelled or badly delayed on Monday because of Heathrow's changes will not legally be entitled to financial compensation. That is because these are likely to be deemed extraordinary circumstances. However, airlines are offering customers refunds or re-bookings.

"A Chinese government delegation has been banned from attending the lying-in-state of Queen Elizabeth II, according to parliamentary sources. Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle is understood to have refused a request for access over Chinese sanctions against five MPs and two peers. Queen Elizabeth will lie in state in Westminster Hall until she is buried on Monday. China says it is still considering whether to attend the funeral. A high-ranking official from Beijing had been expected to be amongst the guests, but a Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman said earlier on Friday that no decision had been made. Who's invited to the Queen's funeral - and who's not? Mammoth task of organising '100 state visits at once' What time is the Queen's funeral? And other questions Who are the Uyghurs? The spokeswoman, Mao Ning, said they had not seen reports about the Westminster Hall ban, which first emerged onthe Politico website.,external But she added: ""As a host, the UK is certainly familiar with diplomatic protocols and proper manners of receiving guests."" Sir Lindsay told the BBC: ""It's better I don't comment because everything has security implications. It would be wrong of me to do so."" Downing Street declined to comment, with a spokesperson saying ""admission to Parliament is a matter for Parliament"". Last year,China imposed travel bans and asset freezes on nine Britons- including seven parliamentarians - for accusing Beijing of mistreating Uyghur Muslims. That led to China's ambassador to the UK being banned from Parliament - a move which has now been extended to a delegation that wanted to pay their respects at Queen Elizabeth's lying-in-state. UK-China relations are already strained and this ban is unlikely to help. The Queen's coffin is currently lying in state in Westminster Hall, part of the parliamentary estate, before Monday's state funeral at nearby Westminster Abbey. The funeral will be one of the biggest diplomatic events of recent years, with some 500 heads of state and foreign dignitaries expected to attend, including US President Joe Biden. A Downing Street spokesman said it was a convention that countries with which the UK has diplomatic relations should be invited to state funerals. Syria, Venezuela, Afghanistan, Myanmar, Russia and Belarus have not been invited - whilst Iran, North Korea and Nicaragua have been asked to only send a senior diplomat. China's President Xi Jinping is on the guest list but is not thought likely to attend. Former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith is among UK parliamentarians to be sanctioned by China According to the parliamentary rule book Erskine May, control of Westminster Hall is shared between the Lord Great Chamberlain - who is appointed by the monarch - and the speakers of both the Commons and the Lords. There is no specific mention regarding control of access for an occasion such as a lying-in-state, but when it comes to ""invitations to foreign dignitaries to address both Houses in Westminster Hall"" these are ""ordinarily"" issued by the agreement of all three. Last September, Sir Lindsay and House of Lords Speaker Lord McFall told China's ambassador to the UK he could not come to Parliament because of Beijing's sanctions. At the time, that ban was criticised by the Chinese government as ""despicable and cowardly"". On Thursday, the group of seven MPs and peers, including former Tory ministers Sir Iain Duncan Smith and Tim Loughton, urged theForeign Secretary to withdraw an invitation to President Xi of Chinato attend the Queen's funeral. In a letter, they said it would be ""wholly inappropriate"" for the Chinese government to be represented, given its human rights record. Sir Iain, one of thefive MPs placed under Chinese sanctions last year, said he would like to ""applaud"" the Commons Speaker for banning the Chinese delegation from Parliament. ""He's standing firm, and I think the government should have stood firm as well,"" he told BBC News. Several Western countries have imposed sanctions on officials in China following rights abuse allegationsagainst the mostly Muslim Uyghur minority group. China has detained Uyghurs at camps in the north-west region of Xinjiang, where allegations of torture, forced labour and sexual abuse have emerged. It has denied the allegations of abuse, claiming the camps are ""re-education"" facilities used to combat terrorism.

Mr Drakeford told Talk TV: ""He is concerned as to how people will manage through what is going to be a difficult winter. ""He was interested to tell me about some of the projects that he has heard of, or become involved in dealing, for example, with food waste, making sure that we don't waste a precious resource when some people might be going without.""

Sales across all retail sectors fell in August as households cut back in the face of rising prices. One analyst suggested the figures showed the UK is already in recession. Sterling fell more than 1% against the dollar to $1.1351 at one point, its lowest since 1985, following the release of the retail sales figures. The pound recovered later to climb above $1.14. The pound has been falling against the US currency for most of the year, partly due to the strength of the dollar. A weak pound means Brits travelling overseas will find their spending money will not stretch as far. This comes at a time when UK inflation, which is the rate at which prices rise, is running at a near 40-year high, despite slipping to 9.9% from July's 10.1%. The Bank of England has predicted the UK will fall into recession towards the end of this year and it is expected to keep increasing interest rates in a bid to curb inflation. Tax-cutting mini Budget on Friday next week What is inflation and why are living costs rising? What the new energy plan means for you Olivia Cross, assistant economist at Capital Economics, said August's retail sales figures backed up the consultancy's view that the UK economy is ""already in recession"". A recession is defined by the economy getting smaller for two consecutive three-month periods. ""Retail sales will probably continue to struggle as the cost of living crisis hits harder in the coming months,"" Ms Cross said. ""But nonetheless the Bank of England will still have to raise interest rates aggressively."" Higher prices, along with upcoming energy bill rises in October, have led households to tighten their belts when it comes to spending. The government announced the Energy Price Guarantee last week to help people with energy bills. The support will see annual energy bill for a typical household capped at Â£2,500 for two years. Typical energy bills were set to rise to Â£3,549 a year and even higher in 2023, before the government intervened. Ms Cross, of Capital Economics, said that because of the intervention, any recession would be ""smaller and shorter"" than it had expected previously. Martyn Beck, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said the government support  ""should ease both the income squeeze and lift consumers' sentiment, suggesting the outlook for retailers isn't as gloomy as could have been the case"". ""However, real household incomes are still on course for a significant fall over the next 12 months or so,"" he added. The government is expected to set out the estimated cost of plans to cap energy prices in a ""mini-Budget"" next Friday, as well as tax cuts pledged by Prime Minister Liz Truss in a bid to boost the economy. Sterling's fall to a fresh 37-year low against the dollar today is not isolated. The pound also hit its weakest level against the euro for nearly a year and a half. So while the big picture movement is strength in the US dollar, there continues to be specific additional pressure on the pound sterling in international markets. This morning's trigger was far weaker than expected retail sales figures. But markets await next Friday and the extent of borrowing required for the government's energy plan and tax cuts. The eurozone too is heading for recession, but there is little comfort in such company. The risk is that a weaker currency, makes imports of essentials, from energy to food, more expensive, prolonging the period of high inflation. And if the UK's nearest trading partners are also in recession, exporters will not see significant benefit from a weaker pound. The fall in retail sales continues the slide since the summer of 2021, when all Covid restrictions were removed,the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said,external. The drop seen in August was the largest month-on-month fall since December 2021. Sales of food, online, non-food and fuel all fell in the month, the ONS said. Supermarkets' sales volumes also fell by 0.9% in August, but alcohol and tobacco sales rose by 6.3%. ""Feedback from retailers suggests that consumers are cutting back on spending because of increased prices and affordability concerns,"" the ONS said. Danni Hewson, AJ Bell financial analyst, said people were ""clearly thinking hard about what they spend their money on"". ""It's just not stretching as far as it used to, and essentials have to come first. But even essentials are costing more and with the spectre of unmanageable fuel bills looming large people did the only thing they could, cut back,"" she said. Shoppers are shunning ""big ticket"" purchases, such as washing machines According to the ONS, department stores saw a large drop in sales in August - 2.7% - while sales in clothing shops fell by 0.6%. ""Big ticket purchases are being put off and that's unlikely to change in the coming months,"" said AJ Bell's Ms Hewson. On Thursday, John Lewis revealed that while its shopper numbers were higher than last year,customers were spending less and avoiding buying as many ""big ticket"" items. The department store and its supermarket chain Waitrose reported a loss of Â£99m for the first half of its trading year. Waitrose said it sales were down 5% on last year, with basket sizes shrinking by ""nearly a fifth"". Food prices have been increasing around the world following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which has been one of the main factors pushing up prices at supermarket tills. Meanwhile, the proportion of retail sales online fell to 25.7% in August from 26.3% in July, but the figure remains significantly above pre-pandemic levels.

"Police in Bucha examine a body unearthed in a field. At least 500 dead have been found since the Russians left. When the Russians retreated from Bucha, a massive operation began to find and document the dead. BBC News joined the local police officers and bereaved families as they carried out their grim task. Warning: This article contains graphic images. Police Chief Vitaliy Lobas was sitting at a child's desk in an abandoned school in Bucha, collecting the details of the bodies. Every few minutes, Chief Lobas, who has broad shoulders and short dark hair, and rarely uses an unnecessary word, received a call on his mobile phone, and the brief conversations went the same: a location, a few details, a phone number of a relative or friend. Before the Russians came, Lobas was an ordinary local police chief, the head of Buchanksy District 1, who spent his days dealing with ordinary local crime and the occasional murder. Since the liberation of Bucha, he has spent his days in this abandoned school classroom, where school posters still hang on the walls, coordinating the massive operation to find the dead. In front of Lobas on the school desk there was a map of Bucha, a once peaceful and little-known suburb of Kyiv that is now a sprawling crime scene. The area was occupied by Russian forces for a month as they attempted to assault Kyiv, and its liberation a little over a week ago has begun a slow and painful process of uncovering horrors. Each time the phone rang, Lobas consulted the map in front of him, and on a plain piece of paper he wrote down the necessary information in neat handwriting, one line per body. By mid-morning, he had filled one side of A4 and moved on to the reverse. The previous day there had been 64 bodies, he said. The day before, 37. He did not know how many there would be that day, but he was expecting the number to jump by around 40 because a mass grave was being dug up nearby. Lobas is only in charge of one part of this region, and many more bodies are being found outside his jurisdiction. Vitaliy Lobas, the head of Buchansky District 1 police department, takes a call in his command post in a school classroom. Lobas paused occasionally to go to the school playground for a cigarette, but even these moments were interrupted by calls about bodies or problems relating to the collection of bodies. It was raining in Bucha, and one of the vans that ferried corpses to the morgue had become stuck in the mud. A tractor needed to be found quickly, because there was a limited number of vans and a large number of bodies. Lobas generally delegates the field work to his deputies, but in cases of particularly grave crimes he goes himself. ""When people have been shot in the head with their hands tied behind their back, for example, I will go,"" he said. ""When the bodies have been burned I also go."" About mid-morning, a call came in from Dmytro Kushnir, a 24-year-old police deputy in one of Lobas's units, to log a body that had been reported behind an apartment building on the outskirts of Bucha. When Kushnir arrived at the building, which stood alone on an otherwise undeveloped green area on the edge of woodland, he found two men behind the building at the place where the property line met the woods. They were wearing blue surgical gloves and standing over the partially decomposed body of a man who appeared to have been shot in the back of the head. The body lay on a stained white duvet decorated with red flowers and was surrounded by empty bottles of beer and spirits. The blue surgical gloves initially gave the men the appearance of medical officials, but they introduced themselves as Volodymyr and Serhiy Brezhnev, the dead man's father and brother. Lying on the blanket was Vitaliy Brezhnev, a 30-year-old former cook who, until the Russians arrived, lived a peaceful life with his girlfriend on the sixth floor of the apartment building that now towered over his corpse. Serhiy Brezhnev stands over his brother's body. ""He was a kind-hearted man, he gave his all,"" Serhiy said. A passport picture of Vitaliy that Serhiy carried while he searched for his brother Volodymyr and Serhiy had lost contact with Vitaliy a month earlier, when the Russians seized control of Bucha and communications went down. It was impossible to enter the suburb to check his building, so they searched for him for a month online, scouring social media in vain for evidence that he was alive. When the Russians finally retreated, a little over a week ago, Serhiy got a call from Vitaliy's girlfriend and she told them the story. The Russians had assaulted the apartment building and blasted their way into every apartment with a shotgun, she said, demanding people handed over their SIM cards and keys. They interrogated her and Vitaliy in separate rooms, beat them, and shot their dog, she said. Then they took her down to the basement with a group of other residents and bolted the door, but took Vitaliy away separately and told her she wouldn't see him again, and she didn't. As soon as the Ukrainian army declared Bucha safe to re-enter, Volodymyr and Serhiy set out for the apartment building. Inside, they found blood smeared on the floor in the stairwells and personal photographs from people's apartments strewn around. On every door you could see the holes from the shotgun blasts - sometimes one, sometimes four or five. Doors with steel plates had been crowbarred. On one wooden door, where the lock hadn't given way to repeated shots, the Russian soldiers appeared to have become frustrated and blown a hole right through the middle of the door into the apartment. Behind another door, it was clear the homeowners had pushed a heavy table up against the frame in a failed attempt to keep the invaders out. Every door in Vitaliy Brezhnev's apartment building had been blown open with a shotgun. When Volodymyr and Serhiy reached the sixth floor they saw that the shotgun had been used on the door of Apartment 83. A rank odour came from inside. The Russians had trashed the apartment and pried open the air vents and even the bathroom drain, looking for money, Serhiy guessed. When he entered Vitaliy's bedroom he suffered the first of several blows to his hopes of finding his brother alive. On the pillow there was a deep blood stain and blood was sprayed up the walls behind the bed. Among the mess on the floor there were two 7.62mm bullet casings - the calibre used by the Russian army in their rifles. ""You could see that a man had been killed here,"" Serhiy said. ""But there was no body."" So Volodymyr and Serhiy began to search for Vitaliy, knowing that their search was now probably for a body and not a son and brother they could hold again in their arms. Serhiy was carrying a passport photograph of Vitaliy. ""We searched and searched,"" he said, ""and at first we were looking for his face."" Warning: Readers may find some of the following images distressing The scene inside Vitaliy's bedroom. ""You could see a man had been killed here,"" Serhiy said. Vitaliy Brezhnev's body was found behind his apartment, where the property line met the woods. Behind the building, next to the woods, they found what appeared to be a shallow grave, and they began to dig. It took time to exhume the remains there. First they saw a flower-patterned duvet they didn't recognise and their hearts found some hope. But when they brought the body up they saw that inside the duvet there was a curtain from Vitaliy's apartment. Then they saw the dead man's shoes and thought they recognised them. The light was fading by that point and they had to be home before curfew, so they covered the body with the sheet. Embers of hope remained. ""Today was the final touch,"" Serhiy said, the following day, looking down at the body. ""Today we took his shoes off and we saw his feet."" Because Vitaliy's feet had been inside socks and shoes they were better preserved than the rest of his body after a month in the earth. ""We saw the shape of his feet,"" Volodymyr said. ""Then we looked at the shape of the nose and the hands,"" Serhiy said. ""And we knew it was our bloodline."" Volodymyr replaces the thin sheet that covered the body where it lay Volodymyr and Serhiy waiting for the van that collects the bodies. Eventually they gave up. Volodymyr had purchased the small apartment in Bucha two years earlier - an investment in his son's future. Vitaliy had been a cook in a restaurant in Kyiv, until the pandemic hit and he was laid off. He did some work in construction and was looking for something more stable, but he had a girlfriend he loved and a dog, and now an apartment in a nice neighbourhood. He loved to fish and hunt, and forage for mushrooms in his spare time, and cook. ""He was living a peaceful life here,"" Serhiy said. ""He was a normal guy, that's all, a kind-hearted man. He gave his all."" ""He was a son and a brother,"" Volodymyr said, trying to hold back his tears. At the front of the apartment building, Officer Kushnir was filling out his police report. Volodymyr went to his car and took two small pieces of cardboard and wrote his name and phone number and Vitaliy's name and address on each. Then he asked some neighbours for clear tape to cover the ink, because the rain was beginning to fall harder on Bucha, and he went back to the body, without surgical gloves this time, to tie one piece of card to Vitaliy's ankle and one to his wrist. ""I do not want to lose my son,"" he said. Officer Kushnir finished his report and called it in. Chief Lobas would arrange for the van that collected the bodies to stop by. Volodymyr and Serhiy took shelter from the rain and waited for the van to arrive. Families in Bucha attached tags to their loved ones or put passports in their pockets, so as not to lose them again. As the day wore on, Chief Lobas's classroom command post got busier. Officers came and went, filing crime scene reports. The list on Lobas's desk got longer and his phone kept ringing. A dead woman had been found in a well next to a destroyed column of Russian tanks. There was a body on the ninth floor of an apartment building. A driver of one of the vans called to say he couldn't find the body he had been sent to collect. A woman came in to the classroom in person to report that her neighbour was dead. ""I understand everything,"" Lobas told her, keen to move on. ""We will try to collect him today."" Lobas's father called. ""Dad, I am too busy,"" he said. ""Everything is OK."" Two of Bucha district's police departments had been destroyed in the Russian assault and Lobas was struggling for resources. There were not enough body bags. His team had also been whittled down over the preceding days to those who had shown themselves capable of withstanding this new work. ""Those who were weak went at the very beginning,"" he said. There was little room for sentiment amid the scale of the task. Lobas received another call. ""Nine?"" he said. ""Where?"" The call was coming from a unit in a neighbouring police department. Nine bodies were buried in a field nearby. Lobas hung up and dialled one of his mobile units. ""The team there is exhausted and they have no body bags left,"" he said. ""They have been collecting bodies all day. Please go and help them now. Find body bags and help them to pack the bodies."" Nine graves, dug by neighbours behind apartment buildings in Bucha. The nine graves were laid out neatly in a row at the edge of the field, behind a corrugated fence at the end of a dirt track. The dead had been buried by their neighbours during the Russian occupation and now they were being exhumed by their neighbours, with the help of the police. ""Some of these people died because they could not get medicine and some were killed by Russians,"" said Gennadiy, a 45-year-old Ukrainian from one of the buildings by the field, who had helped to bury the the bodies and was doing the most work now to bring them up. ""These were our neighbours,"" Gennadiy said, a look of deep anger set in his face. ""Here is Uncle Tolya from the building next door and a neighbour of his. Here is another person I knew from the next building. This man has a bullet wound, we didn't know him but we found a passport on his body. This elderly woman had severe diabetes and we tried to take her out of Bucha but there was no green corridor, so she died. This man went for a walk with his dog and didn't come back. We are not pathologists but it looks like he was shot."" Gennadiy, a resident who buried his neighbours, helps to bring them up from their graves. The work to remove the bodies was hard. They had been buried well in deep graves, and the rain was soaking into the mud and making it slippery. Gennadiy, in a green plastic rain cape, climbed into each grave, one after the other, and shovelled the earth from around the bodies so that thick straps could be tied around them to hoist them up. Each body had been wrapped in whatever was at hand - curtains, blankets of different colours and patterns. They were examined by the police and any obvious wounds photographed with an iPhone. Enough body bags had been found, and after a while the van arrived. In the dirt on its back doors, someone had scrawled '200' - the military identifier for the transport of the dead. The bodies were loaded inside. The sky was grey and the rain kept falling. At Vitaliy's apartment building, Volodymyr and Serhiy had waited as long as they could for the van to arrive. It was getting dark and they needed to get home. Vitaliy's body would have to spend another night on the ground. They were too late now to make the 9pm curfew in Kyiv, but at the military checkpoints along the route they showed the death report and were waved through. At sunrise the next morning, the father and son got up and began the drive back to Bucha. They could not wait for the van any longer, and they loaded Vitaliy's body into the back of their car and set out for a morgue in the town of Boyarka, about an hour's drive south. Before the invasion, the staff at the Boyarka morgue were used to handling about three bodies a day, the vast majority of them deaths from natural causes. Since Bucha was liberated, they have been autopsying about 50 bodies a day, 80% of which were violent deaths, said Semen Petrovych, 39, who has been the forensic expert there for 16 years. The Boyarka morgue used to receive three bodies a day. Now it is autopsying about 50. The morgue, a small outbuilding at the back of a hospital on the edge of town, where Boyarka meets the forest, had just acquired two rented refrigerator trucks and both were full of bodies. Body bags lay on the floor by the trucks and against the fence nearby and either side of the entrance to the morgue. ""There are not enough staff and there is not enough room,"" said Petrovych, the forensic expert. ""Even if we had more people, where would we put the bodies?"" Normally he would do a careful autopsy on every body and print a death certificate. ""Now we just dissect them quickly and write something simple by hand,"" he said. Volodymyr and Serhiy were not alone in bringing a body themselves. Private cars pulled up to the morgue and bodies were brought out wrapped in blankets and rugs. Relatives and friends came searching. Tatiana Zhylenko was looking for the body of the father of a friend who was abroad. ""He had his passport on his chest,"" she told the staff. Oleksander Zakovorotnyi came for his father-in-law, who, when the Russians cut the gas supply in the depth of winter, rigged up a makeshift heater using a gas cylinder, but fell asleep and was poisoned when the flame went out. Serhiy Brezhnev helps carry Vitaliy's body bag out from the morgue, to await fingerprinting. Volodymyr and Serhiy waited outside until they were called in to identify Vitaliy. They stood inside the cramped, low-ceilinged morgue, where there were bodies on the floor and on every gurney and the smell was overpowering. They had to squeeze between two gurneys, beside an open corpse, to get close to Vitaliy's body, and they searched it for scars they could remember. They repeated to the pathologist that they thought they recognised his feet. Volodymyr looked away and looked back. He was wrestling with doubt and hope. Afterwards, he walked behind the refrigerator truck and stood alone sobbing, his chest heaving with his tears. Vitaliy was brought out, his body bag tagged number 552 - the 552nd body processed by this small morgue since the beginning of the year, nearly double the figure in a normal year, the extra hundreds all condensed into one week. The police took fingerprints and told Volodymyr and Serhiy that the formal identification would take around a month, because of the backlog, but otherwise they were free to take him to the cemetery to be buried. The line of body bags at the Bucha cemetery, waiting to be processed and buried. Because Vitaliy was already identified, he was placed by his family straight into a casket. Rather than wait for the body van, Volodymyr and Serhiy lifted Vitaliy carefully again into the back of their car and drove him the hour or so back to Bucha, past the rows of destroyed homes and places where bodies had laid in the streets for weeks. At the cemetery, which was already full, new graves were being dug outside the boundary fence on a thin strip of earth along the side of the road. A priest intoned the funeral rites over a coffin. The mother of the dead man wailed. In the near distance, past the line of the forest, enormous booms sounded as unexploded ordnance was detonated. Volodymyr and Serhiy drove into the cemetery and unloaded Vitaliy next to a long line of body bags arrayed on the ground. Because Vitaliy had already been identified and would be buried here in Bucha, he was placed into a simple wooden casket with maroon fabric and afforded the small dignity of resting inside a brick building on the cemetery grounds. He would be buried in two days' time. Volodymyr and Serhiy left the cemetery and Volodymyr decided that, even though it was far from their home in Kyiv, he would buy a plot there for his wife Lily, Vitaliy's mother, who was suffering from end-stage cancer, so that when the time came she would be near to her son. Two days later, on a bright, cold morning in Bucha, the family gathered at the cemetery. Once again, Volodymyr and Serhiy took the lead and went inside the brick building to prepare to carry the casket. Lily sat outside on a bench, smoking a cigarette, alone among the body bags. The casket was carried to a stone plinth and the family gathered around it while the priest read the funeral rites and two elderly women from the church held the incense burner and sang. Then Vitaliy was taken by the van marked 200 to one of the fresh graves along the roadside outside the cemetery and laid to rest. Volodymyr was still wrestling with doubt. ""I am still hoping that the fingerprints will show this was not my son,"" he said. The family gathers for a small funeral service for Vitaliy Vitaliy Brezhnev was buried on Monday 11 April, in a fresh grave by the road Later that day, back at the abandoned school in Bucha, Chief Lobas was sitting at his schooldesk, listening carefully to a man who had come in person to ask for help finding a relative he had heard was in a mass grave. The man had been to the large mass grave by the church, he said, but they redirected him to the police. He wanted to give Chief Lobas a picture, but Lobas explained that this was not the way things were done. ""We cannot go around opening all the body bags holding this picture,"" he said. ""Do you understand? It will waste too much time."" Lobas explained that they had to begin burying the unidentified bodies because there was not enough space at the morgues. But he assured the man that fingerprints and photographs were being taken and would be kept. ""Even though the people themselves are buried the information remains,"" he said. ""The photographs remain."" The calls kept coming in - a body on Yablunska Street, another body next to a school. ""We have cleared these two addresses already, give us more to collect,"" Lobas said. He saw a window for a cigarette and went to the playground. The number of bodies each day was already beginning to fall, and he thought the job might be finished soon. ""There are no weekends here now, we will keep working until the collection of the bodies is complete,"" he said. He flicked his cigarette away. His phone was ringing.

"A jersey worn by basketball icon Michael Jordan during the opening game of the 1998 NBA Finals has been sold for a record $10.1m (Â£8.8m). It is the most a piece of sporting memorabilia worn during play has fetched in history. Auction house Sotheby's says it drew ""palpable excitement"" from collectors. It was reminiscent of a sporting season - chronicled in Netflix documentary The Last Dance - which saw Jordan winning his sixth and final NBA title. On Thursday, Sotheby's said Jordan's Chicago Bulls jersey attracted a total of 20 bids. Sotheby's head of streetwear and modern collectables, Brahm Wachter, said bidders were ""eager to own a rarefied piece of history"". ""Today's record-breaking result... solidifies Michael Jordan as the undisputed G.O.A.T, proving his name and incomparable legacy is just as relevant as it was nearly 25 years ago,"" Wachter said. G.O.A.T is an acronym for ""greatest of all time"". The jersey outstripped a previous record of $9.28m, paid for a shirt worn by football star Diego Maradona at the 1986 World Cup. It was auctioned with a June 1998 Sports Illustrated magazine, which features Jordan on the cover. The Chicago Bulls trailed Utah Jazz 85-88 in the opening game Jordan is seen by many as the best player in the history of basketball. He spent most of his career with the Chicago Bulls, became a global icon and helped raise the NBA's profile around the world. Although the Chicago Bulls lost the opening game of the NBA Finals against Utah Jazz, it won the next three games. Then Utah Jazz took the next game by two points. In the sixth game, Jordan put the Bulls up 87-86 with just 5.2 seconds left on the clock, and secured his final NBA title. The comeback was cheered by basketball fans around the world. Jordan had abruptly retired from basketball in October 1993, following the murder of his father in North Carolina. The star had won seven scoring titles and led the Chicago Bulls to three straight championships. ""I have always stressed... that when I lose the sense of motivation and the sense to prove something as a basketball player, it's time to leave,"" Jordan said.

"There were huge queues along the banks of the River Thames, where people waited to pay their respects to the Queen. People were told not to set off to see the lying-in-state on Sunday, as the queue reached full capacity. Just after 22:40, the queue was closed to new entrants. At 06:30 BST on Monday the lying-in-state ended. Here's what else you need you to know about the queue. At its longest, the wait time was more than 24 hours. The queue's maximum length was 10 miles - with 6.9 miles from Westminster to Southwark, and a three-mile zigzag queue in Southwark Park. For updates, the government published alive queue tracker for people to follow on YouTube,external. YouTube: DCMS,external Twitter: DCMS,external Facebook: DCMS,external People were warned they would need to stand for many hours with little opportunity to sit down, as the queue is constantly moving. On Sunday morning, thegovernment tracker,externaladvised people not to set off to join the queue as the entry point might soon close. The queue finally closed late on Sunday evening. People in the queue received coloured wristbands so they could leave for a drink, or go to the toilet, and then return. Those in the queue were asked not to attempt to save a place for someone else, or leave personal items unattended, or put up tents. Watch live: The Queen's lying-in-state What is lying in state? As people passed through Albert Embankment they were directed across Lambeth Bridge, into Victoria Tower Gardens, towards Parliament. They went through airport-style security before entering Westminster Hall, inside the Palace of Westminster. There were more than 500 portable toilets at various points along the route. Local venues and museums - including the Southbank Centre, the National Theatre, BFI Southbank and Shakespeare's Globe - stayed open for extended hours and in some cases for 24 hours, for people to use their facilities. This video can not be played People have queued through the night for the chance to pay their respects to the Queen lying in state Anyone hoping to pay their respects had until 06:30 BST on Monday when the lying-in-state ended. But organisers warned the queue would be closed well before this so that people did not join the line and fail to reach Westminster Hall in time. The announcement was published on government social media accounts at 22:41 on Sunday. What's a state funeral? Will shops close? And other questions How can I pay my respects to the Queen? What next?

The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said that all time slots for the accessible queue had been allocated and it was permanently shut. It also asked people not to attempt to join it. The accessible queue had already been paused on on Friday evening, due to high demand, but entry resumed for several hours from midday on Saturday.

"Queen Elizabeth II was the first reigning British monarch to visit New Zealand Sir Tipene O'Regan has dedicated his life to battling the Crown as a leader of the NgÄi Tahu tribe, trying to redress the horrors of New Zealand's colonial past. And yet he holds a deep affection for Queen Elizabeth II, a respect he believes she earned. ""She had a huge sense of probity and what was right. And she also understood very much the mixed history of colonialism,"" says the 83-year-old, who has been named New Zealander of the Year for 2022, and is known to be a shrewd negotiator on behalf of his MÄori tribe. He is speaking to the BBC at a MÄori heritage centre in Christchurch. He walks to a plaque on the wall, stops and points at it with his elaborately carved tokotoko or ceremonial walking stick, a symbol of his authority and status. ""A lot of people ask me: what are some of the greatest achievements in your lifetime O'Regan - well that there is one of them."" The plaque contains an extraordinary apology from the Crown written in both English and MÄori. It expresses ""profound regret"" for the illegal seizure of MÄori land by British colonisers. This particular document on the wall in Christchurch is specific to the Ngai Tahu tribe. But the first apology was enshrined in law and signed personally by the Queen in 1995. The original document also returned 39,000 acres of land the British had forcibly taken in the Waikato region - this was the first major settlement of historical confiscation claims, and the only New Zealand law to be given royal assent in person by the Queen. ""That had a profound impact on our whole conversation in this country. And she knew precisely what she was doing as she framed those words,"" Mr  O'Regan says. ""That has always impressed me about both her and those of her children that I've engaged with. They are very literate in the nuances of our political and cultural evolution."" Sir Tipene O'Regan, a senior representative of his MÄori tribe, holds a deep affection for Queen Elizabeth II New Zealand's relationship with the Queen started well. It's thought that three out of every four people lined the streets to see the royal couple when she became the first reigning monarch to visit the country in 1953. She was 26 and became the Queen just the year before. Her tour schedule had her meeting Maori leaders for a matter of minutes. But she tossed that notion aside after the MÄori Princess Piki invited her to talk over a cup of tea. The bonds deepened after Princess Piki became the MÄori Queen of Waikato-Tainuiregion. The two met many times. But not every visit was so cordial. One of the most heated was in 1990. She was there to celebrate the 150th anniversary of New Zealand's founding document - the Treaty of Waitangi. It was signed by Queen Victoria in 1840 and contains a solemn promise by the Crown to protect MÄori culture and lands. What the Queen's death means to Malaysia This is the moment history stops One protester, angry at protracted treaty settlements, flung a wet black T-shirt at her. The Queen responded in her speech: ""We are strong enough and honest enough to learn the lessons of the last 150 years and to admit that the Treaty has been imperfectly observed."" Mr O'Regan described this as ""the epitome of British understatement"". But it was, at the very least, an acknowledgment that the relationship between monarch and MÄori needed work. Maori say Queen Elizabeth's efforts don't mean they have ""moved on"" from their colonial past ""The wrongs were more institutional, but Queen Elizabeth was very quick to be there in person to do all she could do to right that wrong,"" says Ngira Simmonds, chief of staff to MÄori King TÅ«heitia. ""But this is hard. I don't want to give the impression that we've all just moved on. We've not."" There has been an evolution in MÄori culture and heritage during Queen Elizabeth's lifetime. At a Te Pa o Rakaihautu MÄori school in Christchurch, the long hallway between classrooms is adorned with hundreds of pupil portraits - all with traditional TÄ moko or facial tattoos painted on. Rangimarie Parata-Takuru, the school chair, is moved to tears as she tries to explain what this means to her. ""This would not have been possible in school when I was growing up. You had to leave your MÄori heritage at the school gates if you wanted to succeed,"" she says. ""These children here get to be themselves. They get to be MÄori and they get a chance to succeed."" Some of the girls at the school are organising a fundraiser to go horse riding. All thoughts of the British monarchy are far from their minds. But when asked about it, they all have an answer. ""I did hear she was a very lovely Queen to all of us and she did respect our MÄori culture,"" said 12-year-old Maisha. The school's hallway is lined with portraits of Maori children ""She's a big part of New Zealand and she will have a big legacy,"" she added. Several of them talked about how some people were ""mean"" to them because of their darker skin colour. ""Some people look down on us MÄori,"" said 11-year-old Kourage. ""If they get to know us more - they will see that we are nice."" Mr O'Regan had spoken of his dream to pursue ""a healthy bicultural society"". But these comments suggest that there is still a lot of work to be done. The death of the Queen will certainly give many in New Zealand pause for thought about what the future holds. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said earlier this week that her government will not pursue any moves to change the country into a republic for now, but she did say a referendum could happen in her lifetime. New Zealanders don't get up in the morning and discuss the constitution over coffee. But it may become a part of the country's conversation in the future. When Maisha was asked what she thought of King Charles III,  she said that the MÄori people already have a King. But, she added, ""it's alright to have another one"". What next?

"This video can not be played The Queen: Welsh playhouse amuses generations of royals A playhouse fit for a future Queen was the gift given by the people of Wales to a young Princess Elizabeth in 1932. The miniature two-storey thatched cottage - called Y Bwthyn Bach - was built in Cardiff and presented to her parents, the then-Duke and Duchess of York, who travelled to the city to accept the gift for their daughter's sixth birthday. It was later installed in the grounds at the family's home, Royal Lodge in Windsor, where it was enjoyed by Princess Elizabeth and her younger sister Princess Margaret. The Queen's regret after the Aberfan disaster The Queen 'admired and respected' Welsh culture Welsh breeder's dog fathered the Queen's corgi It still stands today and has become a favourite for generations of royal children for decades. For the little Cardiff girl who handed over the keys of the house to the Royal Family while dressed in traditional Welsh costume, it was a playhouse she could only admire from afar. Jean Sharman with the Duchess of York during the royal visit to Cardiff to see the playhouse Previously speaking to the BBC, Jean Sharman, whose father had helped make the miniature cottage, said: ""Princess Elizabeth must have been thrilled to have had it. ""I think it was charming and inside you wanted to touch everything because it was so small, in miniature, lovely china. ""[I thought] 'Oh, isn't she lucky', then I probably went home discontented because I didn't have it. I'm sure I felt that."" Princess Elizabeth was the first of many royal children to enjoy playing in Y Bwthyn Bach Princess Elizabeth with her sister and parents outside Y Bwthyn Bach at Royal Lodge However, the playhouse nearly did not make it to Windsor. ""It was twice dispatched on a lorry,"" according to Olwen Hedley, in her book Round and About Windsor and District. ""For the first time, the journey was only half accomplished when an accident occurred and the cottage was found to be on fire. ""It was taken back, the slight damage quickly repaired and soon Y Bwthyn Bach arrived without further mishap at the Royal Lodge, where a charming setting had been prepared for it on the south side of the garden."" What happens next after the Queen's death? How titles and the line of succession have changed Y Bwthyn Bach - Welsh for The Little Cottage - was a carefully planned miniature version of a real-life home. Designed by architect Edmund Willmott, the house was built by Welsh craftsmen from materials left over from the construction of Llandough Hospital in Vale of Glamorgan, which opened in 1933. With four, 5ft-high rooms - two upstairs and two downstairs - the playhouse was the perfect place for the future Queen and her sister to play and entertain members of the Royal Family. In the cream-walled parlour, Welsh dolls shared an armchair, while a small Welsh dresser displayed blue and gold china and a bookcase containing Beatrix Potter books. The playhouse helped create special memories for the young princess With a working electric cooker, fridge and running water in the kitchen - as well as tiny pots and pans, food cans and brooms - they could bake cakes and ""play house"". While upstairs, a bathroom had a towel with an ""E"" embroidered in pastel pink and the bedroom had a bed and cradle. For a home in the 1930s, it was very modern and even had its own working miniature telephone. Hospital appointments cancelled on Queen's funeral Preparations begin for King's first Wales visit Ms Hedley, writing in her book, which was first printed in 1948, said Y Bwthyn Bach had played ""a special part in the childhood of both Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret"". ""Right up to the time when state duties claimed first place in their lives, no-one else was responsible for the care of the cottage, which now remains a treasured possession telling unmistakably of the joy it has given,"" she added. Since then, the cottage has been enjoyed by the Queen's children and grandchildren. Princess Beatrice showed Andrew Marr around Y Bwthyn Bach for a BBC series Princess Beatrice updated Y Bwthyn Bach with some input from her grandmother The Queen's granddaughter, Princess Beatrice, oversaw a refurbishment of the cottage and gave former BBC presenter Andrew Marr a tour of it as part of The Diamond Queen series, which was broadcast in 2012 to celebrate Elizabeth II's 60 years on the throne. New curtains and upholstery were added, the paintwork was refreshed, the roof was rethatched and the cottage was rewired. The original blue colour scheme was replaced by pale green sofa coverings and cream curtains with tiny dark pink flowers. ""Granny was very clear that for all the fabric she wanted very little designs. It's such a little house that she wanted little flowers and patterns,"" she said. ""Granny and her sister played here growing up. And we have been lucky enough to play here and cousins and second cousins. It's a real family treat. ""It's the most glamorous Wendy house ever.""

"The pound has fallen to a new 37-year low against the US dollar after figures showed UK retail sales fell sharply in August as the rise in the cost of living continued to hit households. The larger-than-expected drop in sales volumes of 1.6% prompted fresh concerns over the state of the economy. Sales across all retail sectors fell in August as households cut back in the face of rising prices. One analyst suggested the figures showed the UK is already in recession. Sterling fell more than 1% against the dollar to $1.1351 at one point, its lowest since 1985, following the release of the retail sales figures. The pound recovered later to climb above $1.14. The pound has been falling against the US currency for most of the year, partly due to the strength of the dollar. A weak pound means Brits travelling overseas will find their spending money will not stretch as far. This comes at a time when UK inflation, which is the rate at which prices rise, is running at a near 40-year high, despite slipping to 9.9% from July's 10.1%. The Bank of England has predicted the UK will fall into recession towards the end of this year and it is expected to keep increasing interest rates in a bid to curb inflation. Tax-cutting mini Budget on Friday next week What is inflation and why are living costs rising? What the new energy plan means for you Olivia Cross, assistant economist at Capital Economics, said August's retail sales figures backed up the consultancy's view that the UK economy is ""already in recession"". A recession is defined by the economy getting smaller for two consecutive three-month periods. ""Retail sales will probably continue to struggle as the cost of living crisis hits harder in the coming months,"" Ms Cross said. ""But nonetheless the Bank of England will still have to raise interest rates aggressively."" Higher prices, along with upcoming energy bill rises in October, have led households to tighten their belts when it comes to spending. The government announced the Energy Price Guarantee last week to help people with energy bills. The support will see annual energy bill for a typical household capped at Â£2,500 for two years. Typical energy bills were set to rise to Â£3,549 a year and even higher in 2023, before the government intervened. Ms Cross, of Capital Economics, said that because of the intervention, any recession would be ""smaller and shorter"" than it had expected previously. Martyn Beck, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said the government support  ""should ease both the income squeeze and lift consumers' sentiment, suggesting the outlook for retailers isn't as gloomy as could have been the case"". ""However, real household incomes are still on course for a significant fall over the next 12 months or so,"" he added. The government is expected to set out the estimated cost of plans to cap energy prices in a ""mini-Budget"" next Friday, as well as tax cuts pledged by Prime Minister Liz Truss in a bid to boost the economy. Sterling's fall to a fresh 37-year low against the dollar today is not isolated. The pound also hit its weakest level against the euro for nearly a year and a half. So while the big picture movement is strength in the US dollar, there continues to be specific additional pressure on the pound sterling in international markets. This morning's trigger was far weaker than expected retail sales figures. But markets await next Friday and the extent of borrowing required for the government's energy plan and tax cuts. The eurozone too is heading for recession, but there is little comfort in such company. The risk is that a weaker currency, makes imports of essentials, from energy to food, more expensive, prolonging the period of high inflation. And if the UK's nearest trading partners are also in recession, exporters will not see significant benefit from a weaker pound. The fall in retail sales continues the slide since the summer of 2021, when all Covid restrictions were removed,the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said,external. The drop seen in August was the largest month-on-month fall since December 2021. Sales of food, online, non-food and fuel all fell in the month, the ONS said. Supermarkets' sales volumes also fell by 0.9% in August, but alcohol and tobacco sales rose by 6.3%. ""Feedback from retailers suggests that consumers are cutting back on spending because of increased prices and affordability concerns,"" the ONS said. Danni Hewson, AJ Bell financial analyst, said people were ""clearly thinking hard about what they spend their money on"". ""It's just not stretching as far as it used to, and essentials have to come first. But even essentials are costing more and with the spectre of unmanageable fuel bills looming large people did the only thing they could, cut back,"" she said. Shoppers are shunning ""big ticket"" purchases, such as washing machines According to the ONS, department stores saw a large drop in sales in August - 2.7% - while sales in clothing shops fell by 0.6%. ""Big ticket purchases are being put off and that's unlikely to change in the coming months,"" said AJ Bell's Ms Hewson. On Thursday, John Lewis revealed that while its shopper numbers were higher than last year,customers were spending less and avoiding buying as many ""big ticket"" items. The department store and its supermarket chain Waitrose reported a loss of Â£99m for the first half of its trading year. Waitrose said it sales were down 5% on last year, with basket sizes shrinking by ""nearly a fifth"". Food prices have been increasing around the world following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which has been one of the main factors pushing up prices at supermarket tills. Meanwhile, the proportion of retail sales online fell to 25.7% in August from 26.3% in July, but the figure remains significantly above pre-pandemic levels.

"Tens of thousands of passengers are set to be affected by a French air traffic control strike on Friday. Ryanair has cancelled 420 flights, most of which were scheduled to fly over France, affecting 80,000 passengers. EasyJet has cut 76 flights, British Airways has cancelled 22, while Air France said it would only run 45% of its short-haul flights. Separately, on Monday 15% of Heathrow Airport's schedule will be altered during Queen Elizabeth's state funeral. To ensure the skies over London fall quiet during the events, there will be flight cancellations, including 100 British Airways flights and four Virgin Atlantic flights. The strike action in France is being taken by the SNCTA air traffic control union in a row over wages, as inflation soars, and recruitment. Ryanair says all passengers affected have been notified. The low-cost carrier normally operates more than 3,000 flights per day. Neal McMahon, Ryanair operations director, said it was ""inexplicable"" that thousands of European citizens and visitors ""will have their travel plans unfairly disrupted"". ""It is inexcusable that passengers who are not even flying to or from France are disrupted,"" he said. He said French laws protect French domestic flights, but not ones flying over the country. ""It is time that the European Union step in and protect overflights so that European passengers are not repeatedly held to ransom by a tiny French air traffic control union,"" he said. Budget rival EasyJet said it had cancelled flights at the request of French authorities. EasyJet said: ""While this is outside of our control, we would like to apologise to our customers for any inconvenience they may experience."" British Airways said along with the 22 cancelled flights to and from Heathrow, there could be some extra delays on Friday. Air France is only running 45% of its short and medium-haul flights, and 90% of long-haul. It has also warned that delays and last-minute cancellations cannot be ruled out. The flight cuts affect the whole of France, the French civil aviation authority DGAC said. It added that it was currently working with the European air travel regulator Eurocontrol to help airlines avoid the country's air space. Strikes across the aviation industry caused severe disruption to Europe's summer traffic, including ground and cabin personnel, who are seeking pay rises to cope with increased living costs amid high inflation. In July, several strikes by firefighters and staff at Paris's Charles De Gaulle airport led to cancellations and delays. Separately, Heathrow Airport said Monday's flight schedule would change during the Queen's funeral. Heathrow said that all take-offs and landings on Monday will be delayed for 15 minutes before and after the two-minute silence at the end of the funeral. Bus strikes called off after Queen's death Strike action cancelled after the Queen's death Following that, there will be no arrivals between 13:45 and 14:20 during the procession of the hearse, and no departures between 15:03 and 16:45 for the ceremonial procession via the Long Walk to Windsor Castle. Between 16:45 and 21:00, departures will be reduced to support the committal service at St George's Chapel. Flights will also be diverted around Windsor Castle ""to minimise noise during the private family service and interment"", it said. The Civil Aviation Authority has issued guidance which means that air passengers whose flights are cancelled or badly delayed on Monday because of Heathrow's changes will not legally be entitled to financial compensation. That is because these are likely to be deemed extraordinary circumstances. However, airlines are offering customers refunds or re-bookings.

"Interest rate hikes by central banks around the world could trigger a global recession in 2023, the World Bank has said. Central banks have raised rates ""with a degree of synchronicity not seen over the past five decades"" to tackle soaring prices, it said. Raising rates makes borrowing more expensive to try to bring down the pace of price rises. But it also makes loans more costly, which can slow economic growth. The warning from the World Bank comes ahead of monetary policy meetings by the US Federal Reserve and Bank of England, which are expected to increase key interest rates next week. US mortgage rates hit 14-year high as inflation soars World Bank boss warns of global recession threat On Thursday, the World Bank said the global economy was in its steepest slowdown following a post-recession recovery since 1970. It saida study found that,external""the world's three largest economies - the US, China and the euro area - have been slowing sharply"". ""Under the circumstances, even a moderate hit to the global economy over the next year could tip it into recession,"" it said. Signs of economic difficulties are already emerging. On Thursday, delivery giant FedEx warned investors that a sharp and unexpected slowdown in activity, especially in Asia and Europe, would cause revenue to be hundreds of millions of dollars short of forecasts. The firm said it planned to close dozens of offices and reduce service in response to the drop in demand. The news sparked a widespread sell-off of FedEx shares, sending them down more than 20%. Shares in other delivery firms, including Amazon, Deutsche Post and Royal Mail, also fell. In the face of recession risk, the World Bank called on central banks to coordinate their actions and ""communicate policy decisions clearly"" to ""reduce the degree of tightening needed"". Inflation, which is the rate at which prices rise, hit a 40-year-high in the US and UK in recent months. This was driven by higher demand as pandemic restrictions eased, and as the war in Ukraine boosted energy, fuel and food prices. In response, central bank policymakers have raised interest rates to cool demand from households and businesses. However, big rate increases increase the risk of recession as it can cause an economy to slow. Employees look out of the now defunct Lehman Brothers building in New York Central banks do not typically run policy decisions by their counterparts. They have in the past, however, coordinated their actions to support the global economy. In 2007, a global financial crisis was precipitated by a subprime mortgage crisis in the US. This developed into a full-blown crash after the collapse of the Lehman Brothers investment bank in September 2008. A month later, the Fed, along with the European Central Bank and central banks in Canada, Sweden and Switzerland, jointly lowered their key interest rates. They said in a statement,externalthat the ""intensification of the financial crisis has augmented the downside risks to growth and thus has diminished further the upside risks to price stability"".

"A Chinese government delegation has been banned from attending the lying-in-state of Queen Elizabeth II, according to parliamentary sources. Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle is understood to have refused a request for access over Chinese sanctions against five MPs and two peers. Queen Elizabeth will lie in state in Westminster Hall until she is buried on Monday. China says it is still considering whether to attend the funeral. A high-ranking official from Beijing had been expected to be amongst the guests, but a Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman said earlier on Friday that no decision had been made. Who's invited to the Queen's funeral - and who's not? Mammoth task of organising '100 state visits at once' What time is the Queen's funeral? And other questions Who are the Uyghurs? The spokeswoman, Mao Ning, said they had not seen reports about the Westminster Hall ban, which first emerged onthe Politico website.,external But she added: ""As a host, the UK is certainly familiar with diplomatic protocols and proper manners of receiving guests."" Sir Lindsay told the BBC: ""It's better I don't comment because everything has security implications. It would be wrong of me to do so."" Downing Street declined to comment, with a spokesperson saying ""admission to Parliament is a matter for Parliament"". Last year,China imposed travel bans and asset freezes on nine Britons- including seven parliamentarians - for accusing Beijing of mistreating Uyghur Muslims. That led to China's ambassador to the UK being banned from Parliament - a move which has now been extended to a delegation that wanted to pay their respects at Queen Elizabeth's lying-in-state. UK-China relations are already strained and this ban is unlikely to help. The Queen's coffin is currently lying in state in Westminster Hall, part of the parliamentary estate, before Monday's state funeral at nearby Westminster Abbey. The funeral will be one of the biggest diplomatic events of recent years, with some 500 heads of state and foreign dignitaries expected to attend, including US President Joe Biden. A Downing Street spokesman said it was a convention that countries with which the UK has diplomatic relations should be invited to state funerals. Syria, Venezuela, Afghanistan, Myanmar, Russia and Belarus have not been invited - whilst Iran, North Korea and Nicaragua have been asked to only send a senior diplomat. China's President Xi Jinping is on the guest list but is not thought likely to attend. Former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith is among UK parliamentarians to be sanctioned by China According to the parliamentary rule book Erskine May, control of Westminster Hall is shared between the Lord Great Chamberlain - who is appointed by the monarch - and the speakers of both the Commons and the Lords. There is no specific mention regarding control of access for an occasion such as a lying-in-state, but when it comes to ""invitations to foreign dignitaries to address both Houses in Westminster Hall"" these are ""ordinarily"" issued by the agreement of all three. Last September, Sir Lindsay and House of Lords Speaker Lord McFall told China's ambassador to the UK he could not come to Parliament because of Beijing's sanctions. At the time, that ban was criticised by the Chinese government as ""despicable and cowardly"". On Thursday, the group of seven MPs and peers, including former Tory ministers Sir Iain Duncan Smith and Tim Loughton, urged theForeign Secretary to withdraw an invitation to President Xi of Chinato attend the Queen's funeral. In a letter, they said it would be ""wholly inappropriate"" for the Chinese government to be represented, given its human rights record. Sir Iain, one of thefive MPs placed under Chinese sanctions last year, said he would like to ""applaud"" the Commons Speaker for banning the Chinese delegation from Parliament. ""He's standing firm, and I think the government should have stood firm as well,"" he told BBC News. Several Western countries have imposed sanctions on officials in China following rights abuse allegationsagainst the mostly Muslim Uyghur minority group. China has detained Uyghurs at camps in the north-west region of Xinjiang, where allegations of torture, forced labour and sexual abuse have emerged. It has denied the allegations of abuse, claiming the camps are ""re-education"" facilities used to combat terrorism.

"We've been sharing your tributes to Queen Elizabeth II following her death aged 96 You've told us what she meant to you, moments you remember from her life and your stories of meeting the UK's longest-reigning monarch On Monday, the nation paid a final farewell to the Queen, with a state funeral and military procession Our tributes page has been a reminder that hundreds of thousands of us felt a personal connection with the Queen, says BBC Media and Arts Correspondent David Sillito ""She made you feel as if you were important at that moment in her life,"" says Simone Kennett, who was head teacher of a school when it was visited by the Queen We'll be preserving this page so people in the UK and around the world can continue to read the tributes so many of you have left for the Queen Deborah TurnessCEO, BBC News and Current Affairs As the Chief Executive of BBC News I
have the honour to write the closing message on this page of thousands of
tributes to Queen Elizabeth II. And itâs a message of thanks to every single
person who has taken the time to share their story. When the death of Queen Elizabeth was
announced, we at the BBC wanted to create a place where people could come
together to share their tributes, their photos and recollections. The
response has been incredible. We have received thousands of touching stories of
meeting the Queen, special moments, memories and messages of condolence. Thank you to everyone - from all
over the world - for coming together here in this virtual space for very real
acts a of remembrance. Looking at the contributions, the
common theme that emerges is that the Queen had a way of making each person she
met feel like the most important person in that moment. Thank you again for helping us remember
a woman whose promise to serve her people was fulfilled through a life of duty,
which touched so many people. Over the past 10 days, we've been asking you to share your memories of seeing and meeting Queen Elizabeth II or to send in your personal tributes. Thousands of people have sent their own messages of condolence. ""The stories speak to how many people felt a personal connection to Her Majesty,"" says BBC Media and Arts Correspondent David Sillito. ""It reminds us that, while the official record of the life of the Queen will be a series of great moments of national pageantry, those were rare special occasions. ""Her life was much more about handshakes, birthday cards and meeting ordinary, but often remarkable, people. ""No-one forgets a conversation with the Queen. And our tributes page has been a little reminder that for hundreds of thousands of us, the Queen was more than a distant figure in a palace. She was someone with whom they felt a personal connection."" You can read more from David on the tributes here. Sibella Laing went to Cambridge University with King Charles III, has known the Royal Family since she was a child and has met the Queen. She was, is, and always has been, incredibly kind to everybody, always anxious to put people at their ease, always anxious to make you feel you are the only person in the room.  Iâm sure this huge support across the country that Charles must have been seeing will have been really inspirational and uplifting for him. He has had the Queen as a wonderful role model all his life and I think in a sense his whole life has been preparation for this, so I think he is ready for it.""

On Saturday I got on a plane from Verona to come especially to leave the portrait before the funeral. Yesterday I took the 5.20am train from Havant to London and I left his portrait in Green Park. The policemen were very kind to take it for me as the park had already closed for laying flowers."" Frances King Simone Kennett was head teacher of Jersey College for Girls when the Queen visited to open a new building in 2001. The Queen said we had a beautiful school and that she had really enjoyed this visit. She made you feel as if you were important at that moment in her life. The students did the college proud and it was a successful visit.  We also had a light-hearted moment during the her visit. The Queen stamped her foot on the school's front terrace and said: 'This is hollow.' I said, 'Yes, Your Majesty, and if Your Majesty continues to bounce up and down she will find herself sitting in Home Economics,' and she absolutely roared with laughter!"" Simone Kennett, Former head of Jersey College for Girls Glyn Sherman, from Coventry, was serving in the Royal Horse Artillery in 1984 when as a guard of honour he met the Queen at a birthday parade. When she came along I said 'all right, Liz'? The top brass went to come down and she put her hand up to stop them, so I was lucky. I felt bad about it but had to explain to her that I've got a daughter called Elizabeth and it just came out like that.  She turned around and said 'I like to be unofficial sometimes'. It was brilliant. The memory will never go out of me.  Her death has left me heartbroken. I don't look at her as being Her Majesty. We call her our boss. Glyn Sherman I was born in 1926, a Londoner, and saw the Queen on the balcony with her parents on the day her father was crowned George VI. That memory is still very vivid in my mind. Beryl Smith Alicia Finn-OâShea, who is 10, met the Queen as a four-month-old baby. The family were so impressed by that encounter they named Alicia's little sister Elizabeth. She's now aged seven and prefers to be called Eliza, but they came to the Mall on Monday to watch the funeral procession with their mum Claire. It was really magical and amazing but also upsetting. The nice thought is the Queen is having marmalade sandwiches and tea with her family in heaven."" Alicia Finn-OâShea We arrived early from Birmingham to secure our place opposite Buckingham Palace gates to bid farewell to Her Majesty. We are really tired today but so happy we made it. It was an absolutely amazing day."" Claire Finn-O'Shea I used to make cakes and pastries for Her Majesty when I worked at Buckingham Palace from 2001 to 2002 and Sandringham from 2005 to 2006. I got really lucky. I did a modern apprenticeship under the patronage of the now King Charles III... On my days off I went and worked at Buckingham Palace two days a week. Over time I ended up working in the pastry kitchen and had the privilege of making some of the cakes and pastries that used to go out to the Queen during her teatime.  When I heard the news of the Queen's death I stepped outside for a good 10 minutes and really cried, I needed to get away from everyone. There are no Brits near me [in America] and so it's more of a challenge for people to understand what's going on.  It feels like more of a part of you has gone rather than a parent or relative. It feels a little bit of your identity has been lost. Kieron Hales Peter John Wailes, who served in the RAF for 25 years, met the Queen many times and headed to Windsor on the day of her funeral to pay his respects. The 63-year-old recalls how once at Buckingham Palace during a VJ Day parade the Queen noticed a veteran was struggling in the heat and ordered an officer to get them some water. âShe was fantastic and in charge of everything,â he says. Iâm here to pay respects to my ex-boss, I feel great respect for her and want to say thanks for everything - I enjoyed working for her and meeting her.â Peter John Wailes Paul Hayden and his sister handing flowers to the Queen during her visit to Essex My memory is a rather distant one: I think I was about five, and the Queen visited the Essex county show. I was photographed handing a bouquet of flowers to the Queen with my younger sister. Prince Phillip stood alongside the Queen. The photo ended up on the front page of the local newspaper and a framed photo was proudly displayed by my parents in their hallway for at least 20 years.  You can imagine the enjoyment all my friends (and my sister) have had over the years making fun of their once angelic mate and his little sister giving flowers to the Queen but I must admit to being rather proud of the occasion, particularly now.  Rest in Peace HRH Queen Elizabeth II."" Paul Hayden The Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell shared a jigsaw puzzle and watched TV with the Queen at Sandringham. It was a great privilege to be alongside her. We sat down after dinner and did a jigsaw and the television was on.  It's a bereavement, and with every bereavement there is shock, there is loss but there is also thankfulness for a life lived well. A life of astonishing service. She was a person of simple but profound faith, and it was that faith that shaped her."" Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell Raven Harlow Aspenwood is severely visually impaired and has channeled her grief into her portrait of the young Queen Elizabeth II I am registered severely visually impaired, but I felt compelled to do something to channel my overwhelming and surprising level of grief following the sad passing of HRH, Queen Elizabeth II. I think my strongest memory of the queen is how comforting her presence has been during every stage of my 28 years of life, when something difficult has happened she has comforted us with her words, when something wonderful has happened she has filled our hearts with joy, with her wonderful smile and calming presence. She has been the grandmother of our nation, the matriarch we all need in times of hardship and times of joy. Her dignity, strength and consistency has been a great comfort and I thank her for her seventy years of steadfast service. Raven Harlow Aspenwood from East Yorkshire What a smile. She could lift a room with that wonderful smile and that genuine interest that she has in the people of this country."" Warwickshire County Council Leader, Izzi Seccombe I do remember her smile, I experienced that myself. It not only lit up a room, it lit up a nation - and she had the capacity to make us smile too."" Bishop of Coventry, Reverend Christopher Cocksworth Zara Umar gave flowers to the Queen in 2002 My daughter Zara and I went down to the City Square in Dundee to see the Queen in 2002. We waited for a long time. Soon the time came and the Queen was walking towards us. She was about five or six steps away from us when one of her security personnel guided the Queen away to the car to leave. Zara was so disappointed and my heart sank. Just then a plain clothes man came and asked me if he could lift Zara over the barrier. Much to my delight, Zara presented the flowers to the Queen and said 'here you are then, take your flowers.' I couldnt believe it! The Queen must have found it funny though and watched Zara return to me with a big smile on her face. I will treasure this memory forever."" Ishrat Umar, Dundee Three army veterans from Worcestershire pay tribute to the Queen... She was our head, she was our leader, she was the person we were serving and she's the one that we would follow. It hits you, it hits your heart."" Eric Braithwaite, who served for 23 years with the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers Everyone called her the boss in one way or another. I've actually guarded the Queen and Prince Philip on other duties. A big lump in the throat, lost the boss, getting a new one."" Dave Sandy, who served in the territorial army from the late 1970s until the 1990s I've done a lot of parades for the Queen, she was a lovely lady and worked so hard for the country. I was in tears, I will be honest. It was an honour to be with her and be a soldier for her."" Anthony Goodway, who spent two years in national service from 1958 until 1960 I met the Queen when she visited the Isle of Skye as part of her Golden Jubilee tour. As a nurse then at the local care home, myself and other staff members were invited to bring some of our residents to meet Her Majesty. The great day came, our ladies looking beautiful, wheelchairs polished. One of our residents had worked at the palace as a younger woman and had photos of the Queen all around her room in the care home, so, if any one was to be there that day, it was her.  As the Queen approached our little group that day she asked me: âAre these the ladies from the care home?' I replied in the positive and then said this resident had worked in the palace. The Queen looked down a little and asked her: âWhen did you work at the palace?â To which, the lady looked up and and replied, in a rather gruff voice: âAnd who are you?â What a moment. I apologised. The Queen just smiled and moved on.  I was quite overwhelmed, I donât have photos of the Queen all over the house, but Iâve always respected her, especially as a Christian woman. She had a real true faith, so meeting her was very special. I didnât expect to be so overcome by the moment. Her demeanour was that of interest and she handled the situation really well. She left us all feeling very special and honoured. Barbara Matheson from Glasgow Barbara Matheson has recalled the moment she met the Queen during Her Majesty's Golden Jubilee tour Â© 2025 BBC.

"Queen Elizabeth II was the first reigning British monarch to visit New Zealand Sir Tipene O'Regan has dedicated his life to battling the Crown as a leader of the NgÄi Tahu tribe, trying to redress the horrors of New Zealand's colonial past. And yet he holds a deep affection for Queen Elizabeth II, a respect he believes she earned. ""She had a huge sense of probity and what was right. And she also understood very much the mixed history of colonialism,"" says the 83-year-old, who has been named New Zealander of the Year for 2022, and is known to be a shrewd negotiator on behalf of his MÄori tribe. He is speaking to the BBC at a MÄori heritage centre in Christchurch. He walks to a plaque on the wall, stops and points at it with his elaborately carved tokotoko or ceremonial walking stick, a symbol of his authority and status. ""A lot of people ask me: what are some of the greatest achievements in your lifetime O'Regan - well that there is one of them."" The plaque contains an extraordinary apology from the Crown written in both English and MÄori. It expresses ""profound regret"" for the illegal seizure of MÄori land by British colonisers. This particular document on the wall in Christchurch is specific to the Ngai Tahu tribe. But the first apology was enshrined in law and signed personally by the Queen in 1995. The original document also returned 39,000 acres of land the British had forcibly taken in the Waikato region - this was the first major settlement of historical confiscation claims, and the only New Zealand law to be given royal assent in person by the Queen. ""That had a profound impact on our whole conversation in this country. And she knew precisely what she was doing as she framed those words,"" Mr  O'Regan says. ""That has always impressed me about both her and those of her children that I've engaged with. They are very literate in the nuances of our political and cultural evolution."" Sir Tipene O'Regan, a senior representative of his MÄori tribe, holds a deep affection for Queen Elizabeth II New Zealand's relationship with the Queen started well. It's thought that three out of every four people lined the streets to see the royal couple when she became the first reigning monarch to visit the country in 1953. She was 26 and became the Queen just the year before. Her tour schedule had her meeting Maori leaders for a matter of minutes. But she tossed that notion aside after the MÄori Princess Piki invited her to talk over a cup of tea. The bonds deepened after Princess Piki became the MÄori Queen of Waikato-Tainuiregion. The two met many times. But not every visit was so cordial. One of the most heated was in 1990. She was there to celebrate the 150th anniversary of New Zealand's founding document - the Treaty of Waitangi. It was signed by Queen Victoria in 1840 and contains a solemn promise by the Crown to protect MÄori culture and lands. What the Queen's death means to Malaysia This is the moment history stops One protester, angry at protracted treaty settlements, flung a wet black T-shirt at her. The Queen responded in her speech: ""We are strong enough and honest enough to learn the lessons of the last 150 years and to admit that the Treaty has been imperfectly observed."" Mr O'Regan described this as ""the epitome of British understatement"". But it was, at the very least, an acknowledgment that the relationship between monarch and MÄori needed work. Maori say Queen Elizabeth's efforts don't mean they have ""moved on"" from their colonial past ""The wrongs were more institutional, but Queen Elizabeth was very quick to be there in person to do all she could do to right that wrong,"" says Ngira Simmonds, chief of staff to MÄori King TÅ«heitia. ""But this is hard. I don't want to give the impression that we've all just moved on. We've not."" There has been an evolution in MÄori culture and heritage during Queen Elizabeth's lifetime. At a Te Pa o Rakaihautu MÄori school in Christchurch, the long hallway between classrooms is adorned with hundreds of pupil portraits - all with traditional TÄ moko or facial tattoos painted on. Rangimarie Parata-Takuru, the school chair, is moved to tears as she tries to explain what this means to her. ""This would not have been possible in school when I was growing up. You had to leave your MÄori heritage at the school gates if you wanted to succeed,"" she says. ""These children here get to be themselves. They get to be MÄori and they get a chance to succeed."" Some of the girls at the school are organising a fundraiser to go horse riding. All thoughts of the British monarchy are far from their minds. But when asked about it, they all have an answer. ""I did hear she was a very lovely Queen to all of us and she did respect our MÄori culture,"" said 12-year-old Maisha. The school's hallway is lined with portraits of Maori children ""She's a big part of New Zealand and she will have a big legacy,"" she added. Several of them talked about how some people were ""mean"" to them because of their darker skin colour. ""Some people look down on us MÄori,"" said 11-year-old Kourage. ""If they get to know us more - they will see that we are nice."" Mr O'Regan had spoken of his dream to pursue ""a healthy bicultural society"". But these comments suggest that there is still a lot of work to be done. The death of the Queen will certainly give many in New Zealand pause for thought about what the future holds. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said earlier this week that her government will not pursue any moves to change the country into a republic for now, but she did say a referendum could happen in her lifetime. New Zealanders don't get up in the morning and discuss the constitution over coffee. But it may become a part of the country's conversation in the future. When Maisha was asked what she thought of King Charles III,  she said that the MÄori people already have a King. But, she added, ""it's alright to have another one"". What next?
