"Police could not find any suspects after the intruder alarm went off at the Santander bank, but a thermal imaging drone found three people on the roof Three suspected burglars who tried to hide from police on the roof of a bank were foiled by a thermal imaging drone. Nottinghamshire Police attended the Santander bank in Stockwell Gate, Mansfield, at 01:10 BST after the intruder alarm was activated. Officers could not find any suspects until the force's drone spotted three people on the roof. Two men, aged 25 and 40, and a 31-year-old woman, were arrested on suspicion of burglary and remain in custody. Police said Nottinghamshire Fire and Rescue Service was also in attendance to help officers search the roof. Fire crews helped police search the roof of the bank in Mansfield It is unclear whether anything was taken from the bank. Det Sgt Lauren Morgan said: ""This is a great example of how multiple departments from the force can work together to achieve good results and I would like to thank everyone who was involved in the arrests.""

"Liverpool are unbeaten in their last 15 Premier League matches against Norwich Mohamed Salah scored one and provided two assists as Liverpool got their Premier League title bid off to a winning start with a comfortable victory at newly promoted Norwich City. Salah got his side's third to become the first player to score on the opening weekend in five consecutive Premier League campaigns and cap a fine display after earlier setting up Diogo Jota and Roberto Firmino. The Reds were boosted before kick off by the return of talismanic defender Virgil van Dijk after 10 months out through injury and their day got even better when they took the lead midway through the first half. Trent Alexander-Arnold found Salah inside the box and the Egypt forward's touch fell into the path of Jota for the Portugal forward to finish clinically. Van Dijk relief at return after ""mentally tough"" 10 months out It was a little harsh on Norwich, who had made a spirited start to the game as they were roared on by a buoyant home crowd making the most of their return to Carrow Road and the top flight. Teemu Pukki, who scored 11 goals in the Premier League two seasons ago, drew an early save out of Alisson after getting in behind the visitors' defence. But once Liverpool went in front they rarely looked in danger of letting their lead slip as Norwich struggled to rediscover their early rhythm. Max Aarons cleared a goal-bound effort from Sadio Mane six minutes after the break but a second goal duly arrived shortly after the hour mark when substitute Firmino struck. The Brazil forward had only been on the pitch for four minutes when he tapped in from close range after unselfish work from Salah, who opted to pass to his team-mate when he had the chance to shoot from a tighter angle. Salah then wrapped up the perfect opening day for the Reds when he collected the ball after a corner had only been half cleared and curled a fine strike into the back of the net. Reaction to Liverpool's win at Norwich in the Premier League This video can not be played Norwich 0-3 Liverpool: Jurgen Klopp delighted to have football back Liverpool finished third in the Premier League last season, 17 points behind champions Manchester City after their campaign was derailed by a shocking slump as they struggled to cope with their defensive injuries. But the signs are good that they will be well stocked in that area this campaign. Van Dijk made his first league appearance since October last year and he was joined in the centre of defence by Joel Matip, who is back after seven months out. Joe Gomez, who was also missing for most of the second part of last season, and new signing Ibrahima Konate were on the bench at Norwich as suddenly Liverpool appear well stocked in an area that looked threadbare in the last campaign. There were elements of rustiness to the play from Van Dijk and Matip, particularly early on as Norwich got in behind the visitors' defence on a couple of occasions. But they grew into the game and by the second half were repelling the Canaries' attacks comfortably - although they did require a brilliant close-range stop from Alisson at the end to secure a clean sheet. Bigger tests will come for the Reds this season but with the defence now having depth to it and three of their four attacking players scoring against Norwich, they look in good shape to make a more extended run at the title this term. This video can not be played Norwich City 0-3 Liverpool: Daniel Farke praises Norwich despite 'tricky' Liverpool game Norwich are back in the Premier League after one season in the Championship, which they comfortably won to return to the top flight. Their last stint at this level saw them finish bottom of the table and be relegated with just 21 points, their season characterised by spells of good play in the majority of their games only to fail to capitalise on those. Making the most of their return to Carrow Road and the Premier League, Norwich fans were in buoyant mood before kick off and those good vibes continued as the home side made a bright start. They were the better side for the opening 25 minutes, attacking with pace and a directness that unsettled the returning Liverpool defence. But it soon became an all-too-familiar story as, despite their good play, they were unable to take advantage before their opponents went ahead. From then on they were second best, improving slightly towards the end as Alisson denied Ben Gibson a consolation. An opening-day defeat against Liverpool is not going to be a result that defines their season and historically they have struggled against the Reds, who have now won 13 of their last 15 encounters. But with reigning champions Manchester City up next followed by games against Leicester City and Arsenal it is a reminder of just how tough life in the Premier League is.

"Families are staying at makeshift camps in Kabul after fleeing the violence Taliban fighters have captured Mazar-i-Sharif, the last major city in northern Afghanistan which was still under government control. The fall of the traditional anti-Taliban bastion marked a major gain for the militants, who have been advancing at speed as US-led forces withdraw. President Ashraf Ghani travelled to the city just days ago to rally troops. The Taliban are now in control of much of the country and are edging closer to the capital Kabul. More than a quarter of a million people have been displaced by the violence, and many have fled to Kabul in the hope of finding safety. Women in areas captured by the Taliban have described being forced to wear burkas and the militants are also reported to have beaten and lashed people for breaking social rules. Western countries are scrambling to evacuate their citizens. Local officials said Mazar-i-Sharif - the capital of Balkh province and fourth-largest city in Afghanistan - fell largely without a fight. Abas Ebrahimzada, a lawmaker from Balkh, told the Associated Press news agency that the national army were the first to surrender, which then prompted pro-government forces and other militia to give up. Mazar-i-Sharif is a major economic centre that lies close to the borders with Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. The last time the Taliban took the city was in the 1990s. Ethnic Uzbek warlord Abdul Rashid Dostum and prominent ethnic Tajik leader Atta Mohammad Noor are reported to have fled the province. Footage shared on social media appeared to show Taliban militants inside Mr Dostum's empty house. Following crisis talks with Mr Ghani earlier this week, Mr Dostum struck a defiant tone, saying: ""The Taliban have come to the north several times but they were always trapped."" In a Facebook post on Saturday, Mr Noor blamed government forces for the defeat, saying they handed their weapons and equipment to the Taliban. He said he and Mr Dostum were in a ""safe place"". One resident of Mazar-i-Sharif spoke to the BBC of his fear as the Taliban made their way through the city. ""They are going door to door and we are at home and unfortunately we can't do anything,"" he said. ""We are very afraid. My child is very afraid and my wife is crying now. What should we do tomorrow?"" EXPLAINER:Why the Taliban is gaining ground so quickly FEATURE:Afghans living under Taliban lament loss of freedoms PROFILE:Who are the Taliban? Other areas also fell to the Taliban on Saturday, including the capitals of Paktika and Kunar provinces. Then on Sunday morning, the insurgents took Afghanistan's fifth-largest city Jalalabad, the capital of Nangrahar province, without resistance. A local official said it was the only way to save civilian lives. The Taliban now control more than half the country's provincial capitals. Kabul is the only major city still under government control. People there who had fled the Taliban offensive could do little but wait with apprehension to see what comes next. Some reported that militant commanders elsewhere were demanding families hand over unmarried girls and women to become wives for their fighters. Muzhda, 35, a single woman who fled from Parwan to Kabul with her two sisters, said she would take her own life rather than let the Taliban force her to marry. ""I am crying day and night,"" she told AFP news agency. Also in the capital, residents formed long queues at banks trying to withdraw their savings. Some branches had reportedly already run out of money. There were also reports of a riot at Pul-e-Charkhi prison on the outskirts of the city, with local residents saying gunfire was heard from the facility. In a pre-recorded TV address earlier on Saturday, President Ashraf Ghani said a top priority was the remobilisation of the Afghan armed forces to prevent further destruction and displacement of people. Mr Ghani said he would not let a war that was ""imposed"" on people cause more deaths, as he praised the ""courageous"" security forces. This video can not be played President Ashraf Ghani: ''The reintegration of the security and defence forces is our priority'' The speech came amid speculation by some that Mr Ghani may have been about to announce his resignation. The UN has appealed to neighbouring countries to keep their borders open so that displaced Afghans can reach safety. UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres said the situation was spinning out of control. Violence in the country has escalated in recent weeks now that US-led forces have all but withdrawn following 20 years of military operations. US President Joe Biden said some 5,000 American troops were being deployed ""to make sure we can have an orderly and safe drawdown of US personnel and other allied personnel, and an orderly and safe evacuation of Afghans who helped our troops during our mission and those at special risk from the Taliban."" About 600 British troops are due to arrive in the city this weekend to help with the withdrawal of UK citizens. They will also assist the relocation of Afghans who helped British forces and now risk reprisals from the Taliban. Other Western countries are also evacuating their nationals, scaling back their presence in Afghanistan and in some cases closing their embassies altogether. From 9/11, to intense fighting on the ground, and now full withdrawal of US-led forces, hereâs what happened. 11 September 2001 Al-Qaeda, led by Osama Bin Laden in Afghanistan, carries out the largest terror attack ever conducted on US soil. Four commercial airliners are hijacked. Two are flown into the World Trade Centre in New York, which collapses. One hits the Pentagon building in Washington, and one crashes into a field in Pennsylvania. Nearly 3,000 people are killed. 7 October 2001 A US-led coalition bombs Taliban and al-Qaeda facilities in Afghanistan. Targets include Kabul, Kandahar and Jalalabad. The Taliban, who took power after a decade-long Soviet occupation was followed by civil war, refuse to hand over Bin Laden. Their air defences and small fleet of fighter aircraft are destroyed. 13 November 2001 The Northern Alliance, a group of anti-Taliban rebels backed by coalition forces, enters Kabul as the Taliban flee the city. By the 13 November 2001, all Taliban have either fled or been neutralised. Other cities quickly fall. 26 January 2004 After protracted negotiations at a “loya jirga” or grand assembly, the new Afghan constitution is signed into law. The constitution paves the way for presidential elections in October 2004. 7 December 2004 Hamid Karzai, the leader of the Popalzai Durrani tribe, becomes the first president under the new constitution. He serves two five-year terms as president. May 2006 British troops arrive in Helmand province, a Taliban stronghold in the south of the country. Their initial mission is to support reconstruction projects, but they are quickly drawn into combat operations. More than 450 British troops lose their lives in Afghanistan over the course of the conflict. 17 February 2009 US President Barack Obama approves a major increase in the number of troops sent to Afghanistan. At their peak, they number about 140,000. The so-called “surge” is modelled on US strategy in Iraq where US forces focussed on protecting the civilian population as well as killing insurgent fighters. 2 May 2011 The leader of al-Qaeda is killed in an assault by US Navy Seals on a compound in Abbottabad in Pakistan. Bin Ladenâs body is removed and buried at sea. The operation ends a 10-year hunt led by the CIA. Â The confirmation that Bin Laden had been living on Pakistani soil fuels accusations in the US that Pakistan is an unreliable ally in the war on terror. 23 April 2013 The founder of the Taliban, Mullah Mohammed Omar, dies. His death is kept secret for more than two years. According to Afghan intelligence, Mullah Omar dies of health problems at a hospital in the Pakistani city of Karachi. Pakistan denies that he was in the country. 28 December 2014 At a ceremony in Kabul, Nato ends its combat operations in Afghanistan. With the surge now over, the US withdraws thousands of troops. Â Most of those who remain focus on training and supporting the Afghan security forces. 2015 The Taliban launch a series of suicide attacks, car bombings and other assaults. The parliament building in Kabul, and the city of Kunduz are attacked. Islamic State militants begin operations in Afghanistan. 25 January 2019 Afghan President Ashraf Ghani says more than 45,000 members of his countryâs security forces have been killed since he became leader in 2014. The figure is far higher than previously thought. 29 February 2020 The US and the Taliban sign an “agreement for bringing peace” to Afghanistan, in Doha, Qatar. The US and Nato allies agree to withdraw all troops within 14 months if the militants uphold the deal. 13 April 2021 US president Joe Biden announces that all US troops will leave Afghanistan by 11 September 2021. 16 August 2021 In just over a month, the Taliban sweep across Afghanistan, taking control of towns and cities all over the country, including Kabul. Afghan security forces collapse in the face of the Taliban advance. Why the Taliban is gaining ground so quickly Will Biden's biggest call yet also be his most calamitous?

"This video can not be played 'Spitting at train staff has become a new trait for some because of the coronavirus' Some passengers have complained of being crammed into carriages with strangers refusing to wear masks on Welsh trains, despite Covid laws. In Wales face masks remain a legal requirement on public transport, while in England they are only advised. A number of passengers told BBC Wales people were ignoring calls to put on masks, leaving them feeling unsafe. Transport for Wales (TfW) said it was urging travellers to wear masks on all services. Since the start of the pandemic, 8,800 people have been barred from getting on a TfW train for not wearing a mask - with 2,047 people refused travel since the start of this year. 'Urgent change' to get people back on trains Shoppers not wearing face masks 'scare' staff Lauren Elizabeth said she felt ""very unsafe"" standing on a train from Newport to Manchester While most Covid restrictions were relaxed in Wales on 7 August, the wearing of face masks remains a legal requirement in most public places, including on buses and trains, unless you are exempt. This is stricter than in England where face-mask laws ended on 19 July, with the UK government advising people to wear masks in crowded places. Scientists have said the risk of transmissiondepends on how crowded a train is, and how far away you can stay from other people,external. Passengers cram on to a train from Crewe to Bangor In recent weeks commuters have tweeted photos of packed carriages, with some people not wearing masks, as passengers travelled after Covid restrictions eased. Some passengers said while there were announcements telling people to put masks on, including as they crossed the border from England into Wales, many were ignoring them. TfW said it was continuing to ask passengers to wear face masks on services which have part, or all, of their journey in England After using the train for the first time since the pandemic started, Maria Palmizi said she felt uneasy because she had to share a carriage with people not wearing masks. The teacher, who was travelling back home to Barry after a day out in Cardiff on Saturday with her three-year-old, said a group of young men boarded the train, many of them not wearing masks. ""We purposely went on a different carriage to them,"" she said. ""Unfortunately, there were also over 12 people on our carriage who did not put masks on."" She said while a message was played a number of times, and the conductor told people to put on masks, people ignored them and no extra security was in place. What are the rules on face coverings in the UK Ms Palmizi said she felt lucky people sat nearby were wearing masks, but felt ""fobbed off"" after complaining to TfW, who said British Transport Police were putting on patrols. ""I was just shocked passengers were wilfully ignoring legal requirements and, in my opinion, nothing was done to enforce the requirement,"" she said. Lauren shared a video of her trip on a packed train on social media When Lauren Elizabeth boarded a train from her home city of Newport to Manchester, she said she ""didn't expect to be standing face-to-face with a stranger"" for more than three hours. She said she was left feeling ""very unsafe"" standing on the train on 23 July, when social distancing laws were still in place in Wales. ""It was just an awful experience... we couldn't move, you just felt trapped on a train,"" she said. She added that while most were wearing masks, there was no enforcement and, after complaining to TfW, who apologised for her discomfort, said it felt like ""they didn't care"". Callum Littlemore, who travels regularly from his London workplace to his home in Cardiff, said there had been a marked decrease in people wearing masks on the route after English laws on them ended. He said as he left Paddington station on 23 July about 50% of passengers were wearing masks. Despite an announcement asking people to put them on as they approached the border, the 25-year-old said barely anyone did and no-one challenged rule breakers. ""At the time it made me feel rather anxious,"" he said, adding that while fully vaccinated he would continue to wear a mask in England. ""Wearing a mask is a small sacrifice to keep people safe... it annoyed me that other people weren't thinking of that,"" he said. While official social distancing laws have ended in Wales, people are being urged to keep doing it and transport providers still have a duty to take ""reasonable measures"" to keep people safe. Sociologist Simon Williams said overcrowded trains took away people's choice to try and follow advice, and many people would feel worried. ""Many people may need to use public transport, such as to travel to work, they want to do so as safely as possible,"" the Swansea University lecturer in people and organisations said. However, he said many people had ""alert fatigue"", with people being confused, tired or even switching off to Covid rules, exasperated by the different laws across the UK. This video can not be played Unite Wales had said drivers were at a ""mighty low"" at the peak of Covid restrictions Meanwhile, with nightclubs able to open from last Saturday, taxi drivers said they had seen an increase in custom but many customers were refusing to wear masks. Evan Shepard, owner of Evans Taxis, in Merthyr Tydfil, said many drivers had not returned to work late shifts because of fears over their safety while picking people up from bars and pubs. ""It's very difficult to make people who are intoxicated... wear a mask,"" he told BBC Radio Wales. ""They seem to forget they have to wear one when they are in a taxi after spending hours in pubs and clubs with no masks."" He said some passengers where putting him and other drivers in a ""vulnerable position"", as many had been dancing and hugging in crowded places all night before they got in the car. ""It only takes one or two people to test positive in that crowd of 500 to 600 people, to spread it about... you don't know who you are picking up,"" he said. ""It's a bit disrespectful."" Mr Shepard said the onus on businesses to enforce rules was putting drivers in a ""difficult situation"", trying to challenge people who are drunk. ""We are now faced with this dilemma, do we go back to work, or do we protect our health and stay at home?"" he said. Figures on Transport for Wales services 8,800passengers refused tavel for not wearing masks since start of Covid-19 2,047stopped from getting into carriages after refusing to wear masks so far this year 29,916passengers claimed they had exemptions for not wearing masks in 2021 TfW said between 88.3% and 93.3% of passengers were still abiding by face mask rules, and added that with most stations unmanned it was difficult to limit numbers on trains. They said they were working with BTP to enforce rules, and safety measures - such as a capacity checker - were in place. ""We're also continuing to ask passengers to wear face coverings on services which have part, or all, of their journey in England,"" they said. Great Western Railway said it expected customers to wear masks on board ""as per government guidelines"". And BTP said officers were continuing to engage with passengers, and enforcement was a ""last resort"".

"This video can not be played Buildings in Les Cayes were destroyed by the 7.2-magnitude earthquake A powerful earthquake has struck the Caribbean nation of Haiti, killing at least 304 people and injuring more than 1,800. The 7.2-magnitude quake hit the west of the country on Saturday morning, toppling and damaging buildings including churches and hotels. The prime minister said there was ""extensive damage"" and declared a month-long state of emergency. Haiti is still recovering from a devastating 2010 earthquake. The epicentre of Saturday's quake was about 12km (7.5 miles) from the town of Saint-Louis du Sud, the US Geological Survey (USGS) said. At least 304 people have died and many more are injured The tremor was felt in the densely-populated capital of Port-au-Prince, some 125km away, and in neighbouring countries. ""Lots of homes are destroyed, people are dead and some are at the hospital,"" Christella Saint Hilaire, who lives near the epicentre, told AFP news agency. Prime Minister Ariel Henry said he had mobilised a team to work on the relief effort. ""The most important thing is to recover as many survivors as possible under the rubble,"" he said. ""We have learned that the local hospitals, in particular that of Les Cayes, are overwhelmed with wounded, fractured people."" Mr Henry later revealed he had flown in a plane over the city of Cayes.

US President Joe Biden has authorised an ""immediate US response"" to help Haiti and said USAID would work to support efforts to ""assess the damage and assist efforts to recover those who were injured and those who must now rebuild"". ""In what is already a challenging time for the people of Haiti, I am saddened by the devastating earthquake,"" he said. The USGS earlier warned that the earthquake could result in thousands of fatalities and injuries. It also said several aftershocks had been felt in the region, including one measuring 5.8 magnitude. Buildings were damaged and reduced to rubble in the town of Les Cayes Frantz Duval, editor-in-chief of Haiti's Le Nouvelliste newspaper, tweeted that two hotels were among the buildings destroyed in the town of Les Cayes. He said the local hospital was overwhelmed. ""Slowly, strongly and for very long seconds the earth shook in Haiti on 14 August, 2021 around 8:30 am,"" he wrote. Reporters at Le Nouvelliste later said the majority of churches and hotels on the south coast had collapsed or suffered major damage. Archdeacon Abiade Lozama, head of an Episcopal church in Les Cayes, told the New York Times: ""The streets are filled with screaming.,externalPeople are searching, for loved ones or resources, medical help, water."" The president has mobilised a team to work on relief efforts Photos shared on social media showed damaged buildings and piles of rubble after the quake. Leila Bourahla, Haiti director of Save the Children, told the New York Times it would take days to assess the damage but ""it is clear that this is a massive humanitarian emergency"".

Naomi Verneus, a 34-year-old resident of the capital Port-au-Prince, told the Associated Press news agency she was woken up by the earthquake and that her bed was shaking. ""I woke up and didn't have time to put my shoes on. We lived [through] the 2010 earthquake and all I could do was run. I later remembered my two kids and my mother were still inside. My neighbour went in and told them to get out. We ran to the street,"" she said. The 2010 earthquake in Haiti killed more than 200,000 people and caused extensive damage to infrastructure and the economy. Saturday's earthquake comes amid a political crisis in the country, following theassassination of its president last month.

The 7.2-magnitude quake hit the west of the country on Saturday morning, toppling and damaging buildings including churches and hotels. The prime minister said there was ""extensive damage"" and declared a month-long state of emergency. Haiti is still recovering from a devastating 2010 earthquake. The epicentre of Saturday's quake was about 12km (7.5 miles) from the town of Saint-Louis du Sud, the US Geological Survey (USGS) said. At least 304 people have died and many more are injured The tremor was felt in the densely-populated capital of Port-au-Prince, some 125km away, and in neighbouring countries. ""Lots of homes are destroyed, people are dead and some are at the hospital,"" Christella Saint Hilaire, who lives near the epicentre, told AFP news agency. Prime Minister Ariel Henry said he had mobilised a team to work on the relief effort. ""The most important thing is to recover as many survivors as possible under the rubble,"" he said.

American forces have carried out air strikes on Kandahar airport,according to local journalist Bilil Sarwary,external. ""Scores of Taliban fighters"" have been killed, he says, quoting security sources and a doctor at a local hospital. The militant group took control of Kandahar, Afghanistan's second-largest city, on Friday. It is major prize for the Taliban because of its international airport, agricultural and industrial output. Rhodri Davies and the BBC investigations team Work days for midwife Nooria Haya regularly included meetings and discussions with male doctors. They decided on treatments for locals and the priorities for the public clinic she works in. But recently, the 29-year-old found out that meetings between male and female staff were prohibited. It was the first order the Taliban gave them when the group took control of Ishkamish, in Takhar province. ""Suddenly most freedoms have been taken away from us,"" Haya. ""It is so hard. But we have no other option. They are brutal. We have to do whatever they say. They are using Islam for their own purposes. We are Muslims ourselves, but their beliefs are different.""

In it, he reflects on 20 years of war - including his own time spent covering the War on Terror. Twenty years on and so many lives lost, and so many billions of dollars spent, what was it for? What's been achieved? What do you say to the families of all those servicemen killed by the Taliban now that the US is giving up? Jon Sopel, BBC North America Editor   Our North America editor (right)  travelled to Afghanistan after the 11 September 2001 attacks The Taliban have seized control of the capital cities of Patika and Kunar provinces. Sharan, in Paktika province, was captured on Saturday morning, the head of the region's council confirmed. He said that the intelligence department, governor's office, police headquarters and local jail are now under Taliban control. Sharan is 200km (124 miles) south of the nation's capital Kabul. Asadabad, the capital of Kunar province, also fell to the Taliban on Saturday, a local MP told the BBC. Unverified footage posted to twitter shows people waving the Taliban flag and walking through the streets. Asadabad is 235km (146 miles) east of Kabul. The Taliban are now in control of more than half of the country's provincial capitals.   BBC MonitoringThe world through its media As the Taliban continue to make sweeping territorial gains in Afghanistan, the message from their officials and social media activists is that a sense of normality is now returning to the provinces in the group's control. Taliban messaging regularly conveys to Afghans that the militants do not harm security personnel if they voluntarily surrender and that the movement works for all people irrespective of their ethnicity. This messaging seems to be aimed at encouraging soldiers to surrender ahead of a Taliban assault. It also appears to be attempting to dispel reports that the group executes captives and that girls have been taken away for marriage to Taliban fighters. The group has not been observed to say much about its stance on women's education, work or dress code, nor any mention of election as a means of a future government.

Lord Dannatt said the country was facing a ""tragedy in the making"" with a growing humanitarian crisis centred on the capital, Kabul. ""It is okay to extract our British citizens. What about mounting a humanitarian operation in Kabul to look after some of the refugees, to build some camps, bring in some humanitarian supplies?"" he told BBC Breakfast. ""At least let's show to the Afghan government we are not completely abandoning them and that we still stand side by side with them. It is quite possible to do that,"" he said. In case you're just joining us, here are some of today's biggest developments: This video can not be played The Taliban have taken control of half of the country's regional capital cities The Taliban have made rapid territorial gains in Afghanistan the past few weeks, and there are increasing concerns about what this means for those under their rule. BBC Afghanistan Correspondent Secunder Kermani was given rare access to newly captured Taliban territory in the north of the country â where militants are fighting with security forces in the city of Mazar-e-Sharif - previously an anti-Taliban stronghold. Yalda HakimBBC World News presenter I've been reporting from Afghanistan for more than a decade. Over the years, I've spent time with journalists, female judges, female members of parliament, human rights activists and university students. Many have become good friends. Every night terrified young men and women across the city send me desperate messages begging for help. The only response from the Americans and their Western allies to these pleas for help, for the moment, has been silence. You can read my full articlehere. A local lawmaker has told AP news agency that the Taliban have reached Char Asyab district, just seven miles (11km) south of the capital, Kabul. The BBC has not been able to independently verify this. If confirmed by the government, it is the closest they have advanced so far, and is another blow to Afghan forces, who are fighting to keep the Taliban away from Kabul. Here's a map of the areas currently held by government and Taliban forces: In 1996, Kabul was a city already battered by years of conflict The last time the Taliban took control of Kabul was in 1996. It came after four years of civil war in Afghanistan. Insurgents seized control of the city, with Taliban flags flown from government offices. One of their first moves was to publicly execute former President Mohammad Najibullah. Under the insurgentsâ rule, women were banned from work and girls were not allowed to attend school. Women had to cover their face and be accompanied by a male relative outside their homes. Punishments such as stoning to death and amputations were introduced. Images showing members of the British armed forces heading to Kabul to help evacuate UK nationals and other eligible staff have been released by the Ministry of Defence (MoD). Some 600 troops are being deployed to help as part of Operation Pitting. The UK is urging all citizens to leave the country immediately due to the ""deteriorating security situation"" and is offering assistance. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani gave a brief and sombre public address a short time ago. ""As your president, my focus is on preventing further
instability, violence and displacement of my people,"" he told the Afghan people. ""In the current situation, the remobilisation of our security and defence forces is our top priority, and serious steps are being taken in this regard,"" he added. Mr Ghani said he would not let a war that was ""imposed"" on people ""cause more deaths,"" and praised the ""courageous"" security forces who have been trying to defend the cities from the Taliban. The speech came amid speculation by some that Mr Ghani may have been about to announce his resignation. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Thousands of civilians fled to the relative safety of Kabul, Afghanistan's capital, as the Taliban took control of city after city.Now the militants are closing in there, too, and there have been reports of US airstrikes on Taliban positions at the gates of Kabul province. The latest US intelligence assessment suggests they could try to advance onthe city within 30 days. Their string of captures across the country over the past week have been lightening fast. Yesterday the Taliban captured Pul-e-Alam, capital of Loghar province, 80km (50 miles) from Kabul. Even closer - violent clashes have broken out in Maidan Shar, a provincial capital just 40km (25 miles) from Kabul. The Taliban now control about half of Afghanistan's regional capitals after seizing some of its most important centres, including the country's second-largest city Kandahar. The UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres says the situation in Afghanistan is spinning out of control and civilians would pay the highest price if the conflict continued. Taliban frontline commanders and foot soldierstold the BBC they were determined to re-impose their version of Sharia law, which would include stoning for adultery, amputation of limbs for theft and preventing girls from going to school beyond the age of 12.

"Families are staying at makeshift camps in Kabul after fleeing the violence Taliban fighters have captured Mazar-i-Sharif, the last major city in northern Afghanistan which was still under government control. The fall of the traditional anti-Taliban bastion marked a major gain for the militants, who have been advancing at speed as US-led forces withdraw. President Ashraf Ghani travelled to the city just days ago to rally troops. The Taliban are now in control of much of the country and are edging closer to the capital Kabul. More than a quarter of a million people have been displaced by the violence, and many have fled to Kabul in the hope of finding safety. Women in areas captured by the Taliban have described being forced to wear burkas and the militants are also reported to have beaten and lashed people for breaking social rules. Western countries are scrambling to evacuate their citizens. Local officials said Mazar-i-Sharif - the capital of Balkh province and fourth-largest city in Afghanistan - fell largely without a fight. Abas Ebrahimzada, a lawmaker from Balkh, told the Associated Press news agency that the national army were the first to surrender, which then prompted pro-government forces and other militia to give up. Mazar-i-Sharif is a major economic centre that lies close to the borders with Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. The last time the Taliban took the city was in the 1990s. Ethnic Uzbek warlord Abdul Rashid Dostum and prominent ethnic Tajik leader Atta Mohammad Noor are reported to have fled the province. Footage shared on social media appeared to show Taliban militants inside Mr Dostum's empty house. Following crisis talks with Mr Ghani earlier this week, Mr Dostum struck a defiant tone, saying: ""The Taliban have come to the north several times but they were always trapped."" In a Facebook post on Saturday, Mr Noor blamed government forces for the defeat, saying they handed their weapons and equipment to the Taliban. He said he and Mr Dostum were in a ""safe place"". One resident of Mazar-i-Sharif spoke to the BBC of his fear as the Taliban made their way through the city. ""They are going door to door and we are at home and unfortunately we can't do anything,"" he said. ""We are very afraid. My child is very afraid and my wife is crying now. What should we do tomorrow?"" EXPLAINER:Why the Taliban is gaining ground so quickly FEATURE:Afghans living under Taliban lament loss of freedoms PROFILE:Who are the Taliban? Other areas also fell to the Taliban on Saturday, including the capitals of Paktika and Kunar provinces. Then on Sunday morning, the insurgents took Afghanistan's fifth-largest city Jalalabad, the capital of Nangrahar province, without resistance. A local official said it was the only way to save civilian lives. The Taliban now control more than half the country's provincial capitals. Kabul is the only major city still under government control. People there who had fled the Taliban offensive could do little but wait with apprehension to see what comes next. Some reported that militant commanders elsewhere were demanding families hand over unmarried girls and women to become wives for their fighters. Muzhda, 35, a single woman who fled from Parwan to Kabul with her two sisters, said she would take her own life rather than let the Taliban force her to marry. ""I am crying day and night,"" she told AFP news agency. Also in the capital, residents formed long queues at banks trying to withdraw their savings. Some branches had reportedly already run out of money. There were also reports of a riot at Pul-e-Charkhi prison on the outskirts of the city, with local residents saying gunfire was heard from the facility. In a pre-recorded TV address earlier on Saturday, President Ashraf Ghani said a top priority was the remobilisation of the Afghan armed forces to prevent further destruction and displacement of people. Mr Ghani said he would not let a war that was ""imposed"" on people cause more deaths, as he praised the ""courageous"" security forces. This video can not be played President Ashraf Ghani: ''The reintegration of the security and defence forces is our priority'' The speech came amid speculation by some that Mr Ghani may have been about to announce his resignation. The UN has appealed to neighbouring countries to keep their borders open so that displaced Afghans can reach safety. UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres said the situation was spinning out of control. Violence in the country has escalated in recent weeks now that US-led forces have all but withdrawn following 20 years of military operations. US President Joe Biden said some 5,000 American troops were being deployed ""to make sure we can have an orderly and safe drawdown of US personnel and other allied personnel, and an orderly and safe evacuation of Afghans who helped our troops during our mission and those at special risk from the Taliban."" About 600 British troops are due to arrive in the city this weekend to help with the withdrawal of UK citizens. They will also assist the relocation of Afghans who helped British forces and now risk reprisals from the Taliban. Other Western countries are also evacuating their nationals, scaling back their presence in Afghanistan and in some cases closing their embassies altogether. From 9/11, to intense fighting on the ground, and now full withdrawal of US-led forces, hereâs what happened. 11 September 2001 Al-Qaeda, led by Osama Bin Laden in Afghanistan, carries out the largest terror attack ever conducted on US soil. Four commercial airliners are hijacked. Two are flown into the World Trade Centre in New York, which collapses. One hits the Pentagon building in Washington, and one crashes into a field in Pennsylvania. Nearly 3,000 people are killed. 7 October 2001 A US-led coalition bombs Taliban and al-Qaeda facilities in Afghanistan. Targets include Kabul, Kandahar and Jalalabad. The Taliban, who took power after a decade-long Soviet occupation was followed by civil war, refuse to hand over Bin Laden. Their air defences and small fleet of fighter aircraft are destroyed. 13 November 2001 The Northern Alliance, a group of anti-Taliban rebels backed by coalition forces, enters Kabul as the Taliban flee the city. By the 13 November 2001, all Taliban have either fled or been neutralised. Other cities quickly fall. 26 January 2004 After protracted negotiations at a “loya jirga” or grand assembly, the new Afghan constitution is signed into law. The constitution paves the way for presidential elections in October 2004. 7 December 2004 Hamid Karzai, the leader of the Popalzai Durrani tribe, becomes the first president under the new constitution. He serves two five-year terms as president. May 2006 British troops arrive in Helmand province, a Taliban stronghold in the south of the country. Their initial mission is to support reconstruction projects, but they are quickly drawn into combat operations. More than 450 British troops lose their lives in Afghanistan over the course of the conflict. 17 February 2009 US President Barack Obama approves a major increase in the number of troops sent to Afghanistan. At their peak, they number about 140,000. The so-called “surge” is modelled on US strategy in Iraq where US forces focussed on protecting the civilian population as well as killing insurgent fighters. 2 May 2011 The leader of al-Qaeda is killed in an assault by US Navy Seals on a compound in Abbottabad in Pakistan. Bin Ladenâs body is removed and buried at sea. The operation ends a 10-year hunt led by the CIA. Â The confirmation that Bin Laden had been living on Pakistani soil fuels accusations in the US that Pakistan is an unreliable ally in the war on terror. 23 April 2013 The founder of the Taliban, Mullah Mohammed Omar, dies. His death is kept secret for more than two years. According to Afghan intelligence, Mullah Omar dies of health problems at a hospital in the Pakistani city of Karachi. Pakistan denies that he was in the country. 28 December 2014 At a ceremony in Kabul, Nato ends its combat operations in Afghanistan. With the surge now over, the US withdraws thousands of troops. Â Most of those who remain focus on training and supporting the Afghan security forces. 2015 The Taliban launch a series of suicide attacks, car bombings and other assaults. The parliament building in Kabul, and the city of Kunduz are attacked. Islamic State militants begin operations in Afghanistan. 25 January 2019 Afghan President Ashraf Ghani says more than 45,000 members of his countryâs security forces have been killed since he became leader in 2014. The figure is far higher than previously thought. 29 February 2020 The US and the Taliban sign an “agreement for bringing peace” to Afghanistan, in Doha, Qatar. The US and Nato allies agree to withdraw all troops within 14 months if the militants uphold the deal. 13 April 2021 US president Joe Biden announces that all US troops will leave Afghanistan by 11 September 2021. 16 August 2021 In just over a month, the Taliban sweep across Afghanistan, taking control of towns and cities all over the country, including Kabul. Afghan security forces collapse in the face of the Taliban advance. Why the Taliban is gaining ground so quickly Will Biden's biggest call yet also be his most calamitous?

"The artist (pictured in 2004) previously survived cancer in the 1990s Nanci Griffith, a Grammy-winning folk and country music singer-songwriter, has died aged 68. Her death was confirmed by management and her record label on Friday, without a cause of death being given. The genre-straddling artist's best known songs include Love at the Five and Dime and the Outbound Plane, which others saw mainstream success with. She is considered influential and recorded duets with artists like Willie Nelson across her long career. Born in Seguin, Texas in 1953, Griffith began performing and releasing folk music while working as a nursery teacher in Austin in the 1970s. She moved to Nashville in 1985, where she landed her first major record deal. Griffith found country success with her recording of Julie Gold's From a Distance, years before Bette Midler's version became a major hit. Her style of music, which Griffith herself described as ""folkabilly"", was considered unique and blended musical genres. She won a Grammy award in 1994 for her album Other Voices, Other Rooms which was made up of cover songs and musical collaborations. She previously survived two bouts of cancer in the 1990s and continued to tour and produce music - with her final album released in 2012. ""It was Nanci's wish that no further formal statement or press release happen for a week following her passing,"" Gold Mountain Entertainment said in a statement. Artists from the music world paid tribute after news of her death broke on Friday. Country artist Suzy Bogguss shared a photograph of Griffith on Instagram and said her ""heart was aching"" with the loss. Allow Instagram content?

"Recruit Ethan Jones's family said joining the marines fulfilled his dream The Royal Marines have been ordered by a military safety watchdog to check the depth of water before disembarkation training after the death of a recruit. Ethan Jones, 20, drowned after disembarking from a landing craft into deep water at Tregantle beach, Cornwall on 21 January 2020said a report.,external Recruit Jones, of Radstock, Somerset, was one of the last eight recruits who were ""submerged"" during the exercise. He was found ""face down in the water"" and was pronounced dead in hospital. The depth of water at Tregantle increased during the disembarkation said the report The Defence Safety Authority report said there had been no survey of the beach since 2009 and ""therefore no up-to-date beach information was available... in order to aid the beaching on the evening of the accident"". The report recommended that a beach survey ""be conducted at a suitable interval prior to beach landings during amphibious training and exercises in order to enable accurate risk assessment of the beach conditions"". Recruit Jones's ""tragic death"" came as 26 personnel were due to leave the landing craft as part of the final exercise during recruit training, said the report. ""The depth of the water for the first individual to disembark was approximately 0.77m,"" said the report into the single-file disembarkation. ""The depth of water increased during the disembarkation and the last eight recruits (including Recruit Jones) of the 26 individuals to leave the craft were initially submerged."" Two recruits on the starboard side were recovered after a crewman jumped into the water to rescue them. Recruit Jones's rucksack was spotted ""floating in the water"" off the starboard bow. A crewman jumped in, swam back to the landing craft with Recruit Jones, and tried to resuscitate him. Recruit Jones's family said after the incident that he had been ""fulfilling his dream and doing something he loved"". A Royal Navy spokesperson said its thoughts and sympathies ""remain with the family of Marine Recruit Ethan Jones, who continues to be supported by the Royal Navy"". The spokesperson said: ""The safety of our personnel is of the upmost importance and we will now carefully consider the findings of the report, having already implemented a number of the recommendations from the Service Inquiry.""

"This video can not be played Buildings in Les Cayes were destroyed by the 7.2-magnitude earthquake A powerful earthquake has struck the Caribbean nation of Haiti, killing at least 304 people and injuring more than 1,800. The 7.2-magnitude quake hit the west of the country on Saturday morning, toppling and damaging buildings including churches and hotels. The prime minister said there was ""extensive damage"" and declared a month-long state of emergency. Haiti is still recovering from a devastating 2010 earthquake. The epicentre of Saturday's quake was about 12km (7.5 miles) from the town of Saint-Louis du Sud, the US Geological Survey (USGS) said. At least 304 people have died and many more are injured The tremor was felt in the densely-populated capital of Port-au-Prince, some 125km away, and in neighbouring countries. ""Lots of homes are destroyed, people are dead and some are at the hospital,"" Christella Saint Hilaire, who lives near the epicentre, told AFP news agency. Prime Minister Ariel Henry said he had mobilised a team to work on the relief effort. ""The most important thing is to recover as many survivors as possible under the rubble,"" he said. ""We have learned that the local hospitals, in particular that of Les Cayes, are overwhelmed with wounded, fractured people."" Mr Henry later revealed he had flown in a plane over the city of Cayes.

""In what is already a challenging time for the people of Haiti, I am saddened by the devastating earthquake,"" he said. The USGS earlier warned that the earthquake could result in thousands of fatalities and injuries. It also said several aftershocks had been felt in the region, including one measuring 5.8 magnitude. Buildings were damaged and reduced to rubble in the town of Les Cayes Frantz Duval, editor-in-chief of Haiti's Le Nouvelliste newspaper, tweeted that two hotels were among the buildings destroyed in the town of Les Cayes. He said the local hospital was overwhelmed. ""Slowly, strongly and for very long seconds the earth shook in Haiti on 14 August, 2021 around 8:30 am,"" he wrote. Reporters at Le Nouvelliste later said the majority of churches and hotels on the south coast had collapsed or suffered major damage. Archdeacon Abiade Lozama, head of an Episcopal church in Les Cayes, told the New York Times: ""The streets are filled with screaming.,externalPeople are searching, for loved ones or resources, medical help, water."" The president has mobilised a team to work on relief efforts Photos shared on social media showed damaged buildings and piles of rubble after the quake. Leila Bourahla, Haiti director of Save the Children, told the New York Times it would take days to assess the damage but ""it is clear that this is a massive humanitarian emergency"".

"If you like neat lines, tidiness and admire symmetry, what's not to like about the decision of Joe Biden to pull American combat troops out of Afghanistan by 11 September 2021 - exactly 20 years on from 9/11? In modern day America it often feels that all roads lead back to 9/11; the single most defining - and scarring - event since Pearl Harbor: the surprise attack by the Japanese on America's Pacific fleet, which would ultimately bring America into World War Two. And so it was that 9/11 led to this country's longest military encounter. The attack on the Twin Towers, the plane that flew into the Pentagon, and the one that crashed into a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, were initially the spur for a surge of US nationalism. Young people - in fact people of all ages - were going along to armed forces recruitment offices wanting to sign up. America had come under attack; these patriots wanted to fight to defend the country the ""land of the free"", and seek revenge on those who would do the US harm. And don't mistake this for some kind of kneejerk jingoism. It wasn't that. I knew many people - not just Americans - who were of a liberal bent and had been no great fans of all the doings of the US of A but who have a visceral sense this was a moment where you had to pick your team. Were you on the side of the rule of law, free and fair elections, due process, sexual equality, universal education? Or were you on the side of those who would fly planes into buildings, or would stone people to death, or throw homosexuals off of buildings, or deny girls schooling? If that seems a massive over-simplification, maybe it is - but in the devastating aftermath of 9/11, that is how it seemed to many. Biden makes a surprise visit to Afghanistan as vice-president in 2011 But by 2016 it was one of the factors that led to Donald Trump's election: the weariness of the ""endless wars"" as candidate Trump would refer to the quagmires of Afghanistan and Iraq; the wariness of America being able to act as the world's policeman. Americans understandably wanted to pull up the drawbridge, bring the troops home, leave it to the people in those countries to sort out their own problems, and finally give up on the idea that a US model of liberal democracy was an exportable commodity that could be imposed. The liberal interventionist crusade was over. Trump, if he had won last November, would have pulled out US troops, probably quicker. Although Joe Biden inherited Trump's promise to withdraw, in policy terms the easiest thing would have been to continue to sign the cheques to pay for American servicemen and women to stay in Afghanistan for another year. And then another. And another after that. Why the Taliban is gaining ground so quickly Fleeing the Taliban, to sleep on city streets The political pressure was by no means overwhelming. If anything, the reverse. The defence top brass, the foreign policy establishment, America's allies abroad thought anything other than the status quo would be reckless. But one question was gnawing at the new president, and it was the one posed by Hillel the Elder back in biblical times: ""If not now, then when?"" Biden - who advised President Barack Obama not to send more troops in 2009 but lost the argument - went with now, in what could be the most consequential single decision of his presidency. This video can not be played Taliban leaders speak to BBC News about conquer and compromise When 9/11 happened I was the BBC's Paris correspondent, reporting on Eurotunnel's attempt to force the closure of a Red Cross refugee centre called Sangatte  - where many of the world's storm-tossed refugees and migrants congregated before making the final leg of the journey to the UK. I was driving to Calais when I got a call from a colleague telling me to stop at the nearest service station to watch TV, and see what was unfolding. We didn't know what would happen next - or where we would end up. One year into the optimism of a new millennium, there was a narrative and it wasn't a happy one - the war on terror, a clash of civilisations, call it what you will. At the time the two stories could not have been more different, but a lot of the bedraggled people we met on the roads around Calais were from Afghanistan fleeing Taliban rule. It's worth remembering why the US, UK and others went into Afghanistan. The Taliban had - in effect - become a finishing school for Islamist terrorists wanting to wage jihad against the west. Al-Qaeda wannabes were going into the country to train for holy war. The 9/11 terrorists had honed their skills and hatched their plot there. Removing the Taliban and tackling al-Qaeda became critical for global security. Within a few weeks of 9/11, I was in northern Afghanistan, travelling via Delhi and then Dushanbe in Tajikistan to get there. We were moving with the US and UK-backed Northern Alliance troops as they pushed the Taliban out. Ousting the Taliban was considered a global priority 20 years ago, writes the author (right) Our first day was spent travelling from Khoja Bahauddin, then the Northern Alliance HQ along a road where the Taliban had killed a number of journalists in an ambush two days earlier. After one night we ended up in a town called Taleqan. It had fallen the night before we arrived. One of the iconic shots was of a girls-school classroom that had become a weapons dump for Taliban rockets that in their hasty retreat they had left behind. The stubborn last stronghold was Kunduz - a vital communication corridor sitting between Kabul, Mazar-i-Sharif and then further north to the border with Uzbekistan. Now both Taleqan and Kunduz have come back under Taliban control, with a third of the country's regional capitals now under their control. And that raises a super-uncomfortable question for Joe Biden and his ""if not now, then when"" policy. Twenty years on and so many lives lost, and so many billions of dollars spent, what was it for? What's been achieved? What do you say to the families of all those servicemen killed by the Taliban now that the US is giving up? What's to stop terror groups from re-establishing their jihad training camps? At the UN Security Council hearing last Friday it was reported that up to 20 different terror groups, involving thousands of foreign fighters were already fighting with Taliban forces. The regions where Jon travelled are now back under Taliban control I'm sure as I am writing this more families will be packing up their possessions fearful of what Taliban control will mean, perhaps heading to Calais and then the UK. Will the girls' schools return to become weapons storage facilities again? The scars of 9/11 are clear everywhere - thousands of servicemen have come back with prosthetic limbs and disturbed minds. Suicide rates have been rising. Families have lost loved ones. On America's streets are men with red plastic beer cups begging for loose change, many of them with signs saying they are veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan. US-led forces toppled the Taliban:In 2001 US-led forces overthrew Afghanistan's Taliban rulers after the 9/11 attacks masterminded by al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, who was based there. Twenty years of occupation and military operations followed:The US and allies oversaw elections and built up Afghan security forces, but the Taliban continued to launch attacks. Eventually the US made a deal with the Taliban:They would pull out if the militants agreed not to host terrorist groups. But talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government failed. US-led forces withdrew this year and the Taliban have now retaken most of the country. The desire to stay at home and shut yourself away from a troubling world is completely understandable. There is no surprise that ""America First"" as a slogan had such resonance. George W Bush was not advocating that back in 2001 - but there were no US troops in Afghanistan or Iraq then. And that didn't keep America safe when early that morning, across those gin-clear blue skies passenger aeroplanes were hijacked and became al-Qaeda-guided missiles, flying into their targets killing thousands of people doing nothing more provocative than going about their daily lives. There's also a difference between enforcing your will as the world's policeman, and being a peacekeeper. Thousands of American troops are still stationed in South Korea - even though the Korean war was 70 years ago. The calculation of successive US presidents has been that a tense peace is better than a hot war or a destabilised region. Joe Biden was hoping his decision would result in headlines like ""Afghan War Ends"" or ""America's longest war is over"". But 20 years on, and the Taliban now re-establishing control with all that could flow from that, might historians in future judge that the 20th anniversary marked the start of the second Afghan war?

""Scores of Taliban fighters"" have been killed, he says, quoting security sources and a doctor at a local hospital. The militant group took control of Kandahar, Afghanistan's second-largest city, on Friday. It is major prize for the Taliban because of its international airport, agricultural and industrial output. Rhodri Davies and the BBC investigations team Work days for midwife Nooria Haya regularly included meetings and discussions with male doctors. They decided on treatments for locals and the priorities for the public clinic she works in. But recently, the 29-year-old found out that meetings between male and female staff were prohibited. It was the first order the Taliban gave them when the group took control of Ishkamish, in Takhar province. ""Suddenly most freedoms have been taken away from us,"" Haya. ""It is so hard.

What's been achieved? What do you say to the families of all those servicemen killed by the Taliban now that the US is giving up? Jon Sopel, BBC North America Editor   Our North America editor (right)  travelled to Afghanistan after the 11 September 2001 attacks The Taliban have seized control of the capital cities of Patika and Kunar provinces. Sharan, in Paktika province, was captured on Saturday morning, the head of the region's council confirmed. He said that the intelligence department, governor's office, police headquarters and local jail are now under Taliban control. Sharan is 200km (124 miles) south of the nation's capital Kabul. Asadabad, the capital of Kunar province, also fell to the Taliban on Saturday, a local MP told the BBC. Unverified footage posted to twitter shows people waving the Taliban flag and walking through the streets. Asadabad is 235km (146 miles) east of Kabul. The Taliban are now in control of more than half of the country's provincial capitals.   BBC MonitoringThe world through its media As the Taliban continue to make sweeping territorial gains in Afghanistan, the message from their officials and social media activists is that a sense of normality is now returning to the provinces in the group's control. Taliban messaging regularly conveys to Afghans that the militants do not harm security personnel if they voluntarily surrender and that the movement works for all people irrespective of their ethnicity. This messaging seems to be aimed at encouraging soldiers to surrender ahead of a Taliban assault. It also appears to be attempting to dispel reports that the group executes captives and that girls have been taken away for marriage to Taliban fighters. The group has not been observed to say much about its stance on women's education, work or dress code, nor any mention of election as a means of a future government.

Lord Dannatt said the country was facing a ""tragedy in the making"" with a growing humanitarian crisis centred on the capital, Kabul. ""It is okay to extract our British citizens. What about mounting a humanitarian operation in Kabul to look after some of the refugees, to build some camps, bring in some humanitarian supplies?"" he told BBC Breakfast. ""At least let's show to the Afghan government we are not completely abandoning them and that we still stand side by side with them. It is quite possible to do that,"" he said. In case you're just joining us, here are some of today's biggest developments: This video can not be played The Taliban have taken control of half of the country's regional capital cities The Taliban have made rapid territorial gains in Afghanistan the past few weeks, and there are increasing concerns about what this means for those under their rule. BBC Afghanistan Correspondent Secunder Kermani was given rare access to newly captured Taliban territory in the north of the country â where militants are fighting with security forces in the city of Mazar-e-Sharif - previously an anti-Taliban stronghold. Yalda HakimBBC World News presenter I've been reporting from Afghanistan for more than a decade. Over the years, I've spent time with journalists, female judges, female members of parliament, human rights activists and university students. Many have become good friends. Every night terrified young men and women across the city send me desperate messages begging for help. The only response from the Americans and their Western allies to these pleas for help, for the moment, has been silence. You can read my full articlehere. A local lawmaker has told AP news agency that the Taliban have reached Char Asyab district, just seven miles (11km) south of the capital, Kabul. The BBC has not been able to independently verify this. If confirmed by the government, it is the closest they have advanced so far, and is another blow to Afghan forces, who are fighting to keep the Taliban away from Kabul. Here's a map of the areas currently held by government and Taliban forces: In 1996, Kabul was a city already battered by years of conflict The last time the Taliban took control of Kabul was in 1996. It came after four years of civil war in Afghanistan. Insurgents seized control of the city, with Taliban flags flown from government offices. One of their first moves was to publicly execute former President Mohammad Najibullah. Under the insurgentsâ rule, women were banned from work and girls were not allowed to attend school. Women had to cover their face and be accompanied by a male relative outside their homes. Punishments such as stoning to death and amputations were introduced. Images showing members of the British armed forces heading to Kabul to help evacuate UK nationals and other eligible staff have been released by the Ministry of Defence (MoD). Some 600 troops are being deployed to help as part of Operation Pitting. The UK is urging all citizens to leave the country immediately due to the ""deteriorating security situation"" and is offering assistance. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani gave a brief and sombre public address a short time ago. ""As your president, my focus is on preventing further
instability, violence and displacement of my people,"" he told the Afghan people. ""In the current situation, the remobilisation of our security and defence forces is our top priority, and serious steps are being taken in this regard,"" he added. Mr Ghani said he would not let a war that was ""imposed"" on people ""cause more deaths,"" and praised the ""courageous"" security forces who have been trying to defend the cities from the Taliban. The speech came amid speculation by some that Mr Ghani may have been about to announce his resignation. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Thousands of civilians fled to the relative safety of Kabul, Afghanistan's capital, as the Taliban took control of city after city.Now the militants are closing in there, too, and there have been reports of US airstrikes on Taliban positions at the gates of Kabul province. The latest US intelligence assessment suggests they could try to advance onthe city within 30 days. Their string of captures across the country over the past week have been lightening fast. Yesterday the Taliban captured Pul-e-Alam, capital of Loghar province, 80km (50 miles) from Kabul. Even closer - violent clashes have broken out in Maidan Shar, a provincial capital just 40km (25 miles) from Kabul. The Taliban now control about half of Afghanistan's regional capitals after seizing some of its most important centres, including the country's second-largest city Kandahar. The UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres says the situation in Afghanistan is spinning out of control and civilians would pay the highest price if the conflict continued. Taliban frontline commanders and foot soldierstold the BBC they were determined to re-impose their version of Sharia law, which would include stoning for adultery, amputation of limbs for theft and preventing girls from going to school beyond the age of 12.
