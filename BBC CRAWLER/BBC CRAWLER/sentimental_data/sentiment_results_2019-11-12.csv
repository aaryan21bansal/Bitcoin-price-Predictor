"Today marks one month until election day Labour strongly criticises Boris Johnson's response to flooding in northern England PM holds emergency Cobra meeting on the situation and announces funds so local councils can help affected homes and businesses Lib Dems pledge more funds to prevent flooding in the future if they gain power Politicians from all parties pay tribute to former Labour minister Frank Dobson, following his death aged 79 BBC News is broadcasting from Bishop Auckland in County Durham, a Leave-voting, Labour-held marginal seat Labour says it has suffered a ""sophisticated and large-scale cyber attack on its digital systems"" Policy-wise, Labour sets out a Â£3bn strategy for adult retraining in England The Conservatives continue to attack Jeremy Corbyn's spending plans Nigel Farage says Tories should make way for Brexit Party candidates in seats they cannot hope to win Kate Whannel and Francesca Gillett We're now finishing our live election coverage for today. Thanks for following, and we'll be back tomorrow as the campaigning continues. To read our main story from today,click here. What happened today? Here are the main moments from today: Former Justice Secretary David Gauke has confirmed he will be standing
as an independent candidate at the general election. Mr Gauke, who became the MP for South West Hertfordshire in 2005, had the Tory whip removed after hevoted against Boris Johnson's Brexit deal. He announced he would stand as an independent at the
Political Studies Association awards ceremony tonight. Not all of tomorrow's papers lead with an election story. Among those that do is the Express: The Conservative Party has
suspended party members named in new allegations of Islamophobic social media
posts, allegedly made by 25 current and former Conservative councillors. The Guardian says it has seen a so-called ""dossier"" compiled by an anonymous Twitter user who says they campaign against racism. The dossier contains alleged details of Islamophobia and racist social media content
posted, shared or endorsed by 25 sitting and former Conservative councillors. Not all the names provided are understood to be party members. A Conservative Party
spokesperson said: âAll those found to be party members have been suspended immediately, pending investigation. ""The swift
action we take on not just anti-Muslim discrimination, but discrimination of
any kind, is testament to the seriousness with which we take such issues. âThe Conservative Party
will never stand by when it comes to prejudice and discrimination of any kind. ""Thatâs why we are already establishing the terms of an investigation to make
sure that such instances are isolated and robust processes are in place to
stamp them out as and when they occur.â The Lib Dem candidate in Canterbury, Kent, has decided to pull out of the race, saying he does not want to divide the Remain vote. Tim Walker says the Lib Dems had tried to agree a pact with Labour over the seat, but the talks failed so he made the decision to go himself. But it may not achieve much - as the Lib Dems say they will be selecting a new candidate to contest the seat. Read more here. Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon has spoken during a general election campaign event at Johnstone Town Hall in Renfrewshire. She says Scotland ""stands right now at a crossroads"", and the country ""will have our future imposed on us by the likes of Boris Johnson"" if it does not make its voice heard.

Homes surrounded by water in Fishlake, Doncaster Earlier,the government announcedmeasures to help flood-hit areas in England, following a meeting of the government's emergency Cobra committee. Boris Johnson promised funding for local councils where households and businesses have been affected - equivalent to Â£500 per eligible household - and up to Â£2,500 for small and medium-sized businesses which have suffered severe impacts not covered by insurance. Labour has responded to the flood announcements, saying: ""âToo little, too lateâ isnât even the half of it. ""You canât trust Boris Johnson to look out for the North or the Midlands or protect our communities from flooding,"" said Labour's Jon Trickett. âBut Labour will provide an extra Â£5.6bn in flood defence funding, to level up flood defences over 10 years. âEvery home ruined and every business destroyed demands we act now.â And if you want to read more,here is our Reality Check on whether flood and fire services have been cut. BBC News' digital elections reporter, Joe Tidy, explains more about the cyber attacks which the Labour Party said it has suffered in the past two days. The attacks were DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) which is when ""effectively lots of computers are commandeered to flood a server or a network with too much information, so too many requests, and then that website or server falls over"". ""I always think about buying tickets for Glastonbury,"" he says. ""So many people flood the website at the same time, the website falls over."" He says it's ""very hard to pinpoint exactly who and why they would do this"". But, for ""every pound that is taken away from campaigning to be spent on security is money that could be spent on getting the message out there and getting to voters"", he adds. The estranged wife of former Burton MP Andrew Griffiths has been selected as the Conservative candidate to contest the seat at the general election. Mr Griffiths resigned as a minister last July after a newspaper published sexual messages that he had sent to two barmaids. The parliamentary standards watchdogcleared him of wrongdoing,saying it found no evidence he sent them while he would have been engaged in parliamentary activities. Earlier, Mr Griffiths confirmed he was withdrawing from the selection process after a tied vote last night - and his wife, Kate, would seek selection instead. She'll be defending a majority of more than 10,000. The prime minister leaves the teabag in. That was one revelation that came to light in an election broadcast posted on his Twitter account. The other was that Boris Johnson's favourite band was ""either The Clash or The Rolling Stones"". ""Mainly I listen to the Rolling Stones nowadays, so you can make of that what you will,"" he tells the camera. Richard MossPolitical Editor, BBC Look North If you talk to Labour candidates in seats like Bishop Auckland, they say they are facing two problems. One is Brexit, the other is Jeremy Corbyn. Although the voters on the doorstep like some of Labour's policies, they have personal animosity towards Mr Corbyn. The Tories face challenges too - they thought they were going to make gains in 2017, but they didn't. They underestimated the Labour electoral machine and the history that is here. Their other problem is the Brexit party, which is still standing in seats like this one and could take votes from the Conservatives. The links with Labour are strained here, but are they broken? Conservatives won't take that for granted until the votes are counted. Piers Morgan with his Good Morning Britain co-host Susanna Reid TV presenter Piers Morgan has long been a critic of the so-called ""snowflake"" generation - the derogatory term used to describe younger people by those who view them as more easily-offended or less resilient than older people. But speaking at the annual ITV Palooza event in London tonight, he said he believes the rise of leaders like Boris Johnson and Donald Trump ""is a complete reaction to this PC culture we're now being subjected to"". ""I represent the silent majority who are sick and tired of snowflake central and the PC culture that is now enveloping every part of our lives,"" he said. ""When you spend all your time telling people how to live their lives, the Brits that I know eventually go 'enough'.""  Earlier, it was announced that Steve Bray - the man known for standing in Westminster and shouting ""stop Brexit"" -will stand in the general election. Mr Bray, 50, will contest the Welsh Labour-held constituency of Cynon Valley for the Lib Dems. Mr Bray - who has voted for Labour, the Lib Dems and once for the Tories in previous elections - says his decision to stand for the Lib Dems came after leader Jo Swinson pledged to stop Brexit. Admitting he faces a challenge, he says: ""Its a Labour stronghold. I hope to boost the [Lib Dem] vote in the area. ""As much as I hate to say it, another referendum would just leave divisions. ""If that's what it takes, so be it, but I would rather they put a stop to it at Parliament and they revoke Article 50."" BBC Newsnight's Emily Maitlis joins the team at Brexitcast HQ to talk about an unexpected cameo in the election campaign from former US secretary of state and presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Listen totoday's episode here.  Politicians have taken time out of the campaign trail today to pay tribute to former Labour minister Frank Dobson whohas died aged 79. Mr Dobson was a popular figure in the party and served as health secretary under Tony Blair. Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott called him a ""funny, very kind man"" while Ed Miliband described him as a ""profoundly decent person"". Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""A cyber attack against a political party in an election is suspicious"" Labour is reportedly suffering a second cyber-attack after saying it successfully thwarted one on Monday. The party says it has ""ongoing security processes in place"" so users ""may be experiencing some differences"", which it is dealing with ""quickly"". The Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack floods a computer server with traffic to try to take it offline. The BBC's Gordon Corera has been told Monday's attack was not linked to a state. Earlier, a Labour source said that attacks came from computers in Russia and Brazil. Our security correspondent said he had been told the first attack was a low-level incident - not a large-scale and sophisticated attack. A National Cyber Security Centre spokesman said the Labour Party followed the correct procedure and notified them swiftly of Monday's cyber-attack, adding: ""The attack was not successful and the incident is now closed."" Meanwhile, Labour has denied that there has been a data breach or a security flaw in its systems afterthe Times reported the party's website had exposed the names of online donors,external. Live: Latest election news Cyber-attacks on UK firms 'jump' in 2019 Following reports of a second cyber-attack, a Labour Party spokesperson said: ""We have ongoing security processes in place to protect our platforms, so users may be experiencing some differences. We are dealing with this quickly and efficiently."" DDoS attacks direct huge amounts of internet traffic at a target in an effort to overwhelm computer servers, causing their software to crash. They are often carried out via a network of hijacked computers and other internet-connected devices known as a botnet. The owners of which may be unaware their equipment is involved. DDoS attacks are not normally recognised as being a hack as they do not involve breaking into a target's systems to insert malware. They can vary in sophistication and size, and are sometimes used as a diversionary tactic to carry out a more damaging attack under the radar. Several companies provide services to repel DDoS attacks, but they can be costly. The BBC has confirmed that Labour is using software by the technology company Cloudflare to protect its systems. The US-based company boasts it has 15 times the network capacity of the biggest DDoS attack ever recorded, meaning it should be able to absorb any deluge of data directed at one of its clients. BBC political correspondent Jessica Parker said ""Labour Connects"", a tool for campaigners to design and print materials was disrupted on Monday and was ""closed for maintenance"" on Tuesday morning. A message on the site on Monday said it was experiencing issues ""due to the large volume of users"". This video can not be played EXPLAINED: What is a DDoS attack? Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Monday's cyber-attack was ""very serious"" and also ""suspicious"" because it took place during an election campaign. ""If this is a sign of things to come, I feel very nervous about it,"" he said. In a letter sent to Labour campaigners, Niall Sookoo, the party's executive director of elections and campaigns, said: ""Yesterday afternoon our security systems identified that, in a very short period of time, there were large-scale and sophisticated attacks on Labour Party platforms which had the intention of taking our systems entirely offline. ""Every single one of these attempts failed due to our robust security systems and the integrity of all our platforms and data was maintained."" Labour's general secretary Jennie Formby said on Twitter the attack was a ""real concern"" but she added she was proud of the party's staff who ""took immediate action to ensure our systems and data are all safe "". Emily Orton, from Darktrace, an AI company for cyber-security, told BBC Radio 4's The World at One: ""Really this is the tip of the iceberg in terms of the types of threats that, not just the Labour Party, but all political parties are going to be without a doubt experiencing on a daily basis."" ""I think anyone involved in politics and in government need to be preparing themselves for a lot more stealthy, sophisticated attacks than this,"" she added. By Leo Kelion, Technology desk editor The Times has revealed that Labour exposed the names of people who had donated money via an online tool. The details could be found via an RSS web feed generated by the site's code, which most browsers provide a way to inspect. In most cases the information was limited to the donors' first names and the sums given. But because some people had mistakenly added their surname to the first name input box, this too was disclosed. Labour denies this represented a security flaw or that a reportable data breach had occurred. It also believes that only a small number of full names were exposed. However, it made changes to shut down the RSS feed last night. ""The Labour Party takes its responsibilities for data protection extremely seriously,"" a spokesman said. ""If any concerns are raised, we assess them in line with our responsibilities under GDPR [General Data Protection Regulation ] and the Data Protection Act."" The Information Commissioner's Office told the BBC: ""We will not be commenting publicly on every issue raised during the general election. ""We will, however, be closely monitoring how personal data is being used during political campaigning and making sure that all parties and campaigns are aware of their responsibilities.""

"John Lawler died following treatment at the Chiropractic 1st clinic in York A chiropractor whose patient's neck broke during treatment has told an inquest she had ""never experienced anything"" like it. Arleen Scholten was treating 80-year-old John Lawler at Chiropractic 1st in York in August 2017 when he became unresponsive. His family were later told in hospital his neck was fractured. He died the next day. A criminal investigation into his death ruled out any charges. Giving evidence on the second day of the inquest, Mrs Scholten, said she had trained in Canada and had been practising for 16 years and moved to the UK in 2005. Mr Lawler had come to her at the end of July for an initial assessment complaining of aches in his legs. She was told Mr Lawler had back surgery a decade ago for spinal stenosis and had metal rods inserted in his lower back. Mrs Scholten said despite this she believed she could relieve some of his pain by what she described as ""gentle manipulation"". ""I did think I could help. I would never start care unless I thought I could help,"" she said. Mrs Scholten said treatment involved a hand-held activator, which applies a light pressure to the patient, and dropping a section of the treatment table to ""stretch"" the joint tissues. On 11 August she began treatment in the usual way. ""I used a drop and he let out a groan and said 'my arms don't feel right'. ""I waited a couple of seconds and asked him if he was okay and he said again 'my arms don't feel right'."" She said it was something she had never experienced in her 16 years of adjusting people. Mr Lawler's widow told the inquest on Monday he had shouted ""you are hurting me"" at this point, however Mrs Scholten said she did not hear him say that. Mrs Scholten said she managed to get him to a chair before asking her receptionist to call an ambulance. She told paramedics she had been applying ""gentle manipulation"" but did not tell them about using the drop treatment. She said she was in a ""complete and utter state of panic"" and could not explain why she had not mentioned that element of treatment. For the family, Mr Richard Copnall, said given the rods in his lower back he was surely not a ""suitable"" patient for chiropractic treatment. Mrs Scholten said she had treated other patients who had had back surgery before. ""I felt I could help him, I wanted to help him,"" she said. She said what happened on the 11 August was ""rare and unusual"". ""I've never experienced anything like this."" The inquest continues.

"The Liberal Democrat candidate in Canterbury has stood down because he feared dividing the Remain vote. Tim Walker said he was concerned standing would allow the Conservative candidate to take the seat from Labour. Mr Walker said the Lib Dems had tried to do a deal with Labour over the seat, and when that failed he made the decision himself to stand down. The Lib Dems told the BBC they will be selecting a new candidate to contest the Kent constituency. Labour's Rosie Duffield took the seat from the Tories at the 2017 general election with a majority of only 187 votes. The constituency voted 51% to leave the EU in the Brexit referendum in 2016. Lib Dems, Greens and Plaid agree election pact What is tactical voting and how do election pacts work? Writing in the Guardian,,externalMr Walker said: ""Politics does not always have to be grubby and small-minded; sometimes it's possible to acknowledge that what's at stake is more important than party politics - and personal ambition - and we can do what's right. ""In this invidious situation, both standing and not standing could be interpreted as weakness. ""But the nightmare that kept me awake was posing awkwardly at the count beside a vanquished Duffield as the Tory Brexiter raised her hands in triumph. I wanted no part in that."" Speaking earlier on Tuesday evening, before the news emerged, Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson was asked about whether her party could still do an electoral deal with Labour, She told the BBC Labour had failed to engage in previous talks with Remain-supporting parties and said Labour ""aren't really qualified to be a part of a Remain alliance"". Last week,the Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru and the Green Party announcedan electoral pact, agreeing not to stand against each other in 60 seats in England and Wales. On Monday, Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage announced his candidates would not be standing in the 317 seats won by the Conservatives in the 2017 election. The candidates standing in the Canterbury constituency announced so far are: Rosie Duffield (Labour) Anna Firth (Conservatives) Owen Prew (Brexit Party) Henry Stanton (Green Party) Lib Dems, Greens and Plaid agree election pact What is the secret behind tactical voting?

"This video can not be played Former minister David Gauke: ""A Conservative majority... will take us in the direction of a very hard Brexit"" Former justice secretary David Gauke says a Conservative majority at the upcoming election would be a ""bad outcome for the country"". Mr Gauke - who confirmed he will run as an independent in 12 December poll - was among the MPs expelled from the Tories by Boris Johnson after he voted against a no-deal Brexit. He said a majority led by Mr Johnson would mean a ""very hard Brexit"". But Tory Minister Michael Gove said his former colleague was ""precisely wrong"". Mr Gove told BBC Breakfast the Conservatives were pursuing ""a good Brexit deal which works for whole UK [and] which will enable us to have a relationship with the EU based on free trade and friendly co-operation."" Responding to Mr Gauke's comments, Mr Johnson said: ""We are fighting for every vote we can get. I regret we haven't got his support, but we will do our best in the campaign ahead."" Mr Gauke confirmed his decision to stand in South West Hertfordshire - where he has been the MP since 2005 - at a political awards ceremony on Tuesday. But he has urged voters in some constituencies to vote for the Liberal Democrats LIVE: Election campaign latest Tories choose candidate to take place of Gauke Reality Check: What does a 'WTO Brexit' mean? Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Gauke attacked the policy of the Conservatives to not extend the implementation period for Brexit past December 2020. During these months, the UK would stick to the EU rules on issues such as freedom of movement. The Tories plan to negotiate a free trade agreement with the European Union during that time, but have pledged to leave without one if no deal is reached by the deadline. Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage cited the pledge as one of the reasons for hisdecision not to stand candidates in the 317 seats won by the Toriesat the last general election, in 2017. This video can not be played Tory Minister Michael Gove says the UK ""can secure a free trade deal by the end of 2020"" Mr Gauke said ""one simply cannot renegotiate a trade deal in that time period"", and leaving without a deal would be ""disastrous for the prosperity of our countryâ¦ [making] whole sectors unviable"". But he said Mr Johnson was so ""boxed in"" to the plan that he couldn't change his mind even if he wanted to - and he showed no sign of that. ""He would have letters flooding in to the chairman of the 1922 committee [trying to oust him] and Nigel Farage would be out making a lot of noise,"" said Mr Gauke. ""I don't think that either the parliamentary party or the wider Conservative membership would allow him to do that. He is boxed in unless Parliament is in a position to force him to extend.""

Mr Gauke said his comments were not a personal attack on Mr Johnson, although he said the PM ""lacks qualities some would ideally want in prime minister"". But he urged voters to support ""the centre ground"" in the election so they could stop a hard Brexit, even lending their support to the Liberal Democrats if needs be. ""I have to say I am impressed by [Lib Dem leader] Jo Swinson and if I was living in a lot of constituencies I would lend my vote,"" he told Today. Mr Gauke now backs a confirmatory referendum on Mr Johnson's deal versus Remain. ""I have reluctantly come to that view,"" he said. ""I thought the best outcome for our country was for us to unite behind some kind of soft Brexit [but] that option isn't there any more. The country is too polarised and there isn't the support for it. ""[Mr Johnson's plan] is a harder Brexit than what was promised to the British people in 2016. ""Because the consequences of the Johnson deal are so significant, we do need to check back in with the people, and it is perfectly possible to get a parliamentary majority for that after the election."" Just four months ago David Gauke was a cabinet minister and regarded as one of the safest pair of hands in the Tory Party. He is now urging voters to stop Boris Johnson from winning a majority. His decision to stand as an independent candidate is prompted by his fear that Mr Johnson is ""boxed in"" to a no-deal Brexit by his refusal to consider any extension of the transition period beyond December 2020. An impossible timetable, Mr Gauke believes, in which to secure a trade deal - and a view shared by many hard line Brexiteers. Mr Gauke is one of only a small band of former Tory rebels who've chosen to fight on, rather than to quit politics altogether. But Lib Dem sources said they were unlikely to stand aside in his Hertfordshire seat. Meanwhile, Downing Street has shrugged off his decision and later Mr Johnson will repeat his Brexit message - that his deal is the only way to get Britain out of the rut and end the ""groundhoggery"". Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Mr Gove, said his former colleague was ""a good friend, but I think on this issue he's got it precisely wrong"". He told Breakfast: ""The only way that we can Brexit done is by making sure we do have a functioning majority government. ""We're going to get a good deal with the EU and we're going to get it by the end of 2020."" Mr Gove added: ""One of the problems that we've had is that Parliament has engaged in endless dither and delay on this, and that's because we haven't had a strong majority."" Earlier, Gagan Mohindra was chosen as the Conservative candidate for Mr Gauke's constituency. Mr Mohindra is a member of Essex County Council and Epping Forest District Council. Some parties are yet to choose their candidates for South West Hertfordshire, but Tom Pashby has been selected for the Green Party and Sally Symington will represent the Liberal Democrats. Mr Gauke is not the first politician to call on the public to back a rival party in the December election. On Monday, his fellow former Tory MP Nick Boleslaunched a scathing attack on both Mr Johnson and Mr Corbynin the Evening Standard, and said people should vote Lib Dem. This came after two former Labour MPs - Ian Austin and John Woodcock - saidthe electorate should back Mr Johnsonas Mr Corbyn was ""completely unfit"" to be PM.

"South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service carry a child through floods in Doncaster on Friday, 8 November Extensive, fatal flooding has put the rescue services in the spotlight of the election campaign. A press release from the Labour Party on Monday,externalnight made a series of claims about the cuts to funding for the Environment Agency and front-line fire-and-rescue services (who are helping with the relief effort after the floods). Speaking in Blackpool on Tuesday morning, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the response to the flooding ""would have been a different story"" if it had happened ""in Surrey instead of Yorkshire"". ""Under the Tories, front-line flood response and Environment Agency staff have been slashed by a fifth, and our fire-and-rescue service by nearly a quarter,"" he said. Do the numbers add up? Claim: There has been a 20% cut in staff numbers at the Environment Agency under the Conservatives Asked by Reality Check where the 20% figure had come from, Labour identifiedan article from Unearthed,external, a journalism project run by Greenpeace. According to Unearthed, there were 13,027 staff employed by the Environment Agency in January 2013 and this figure fell to 10,533 by January 2018. That would be a fall of 19.1% - or just under a fifth. And the figures match up withworkforce data,externalheld by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. The starting point of the data, January 2013, is three years into the Conservatives' period in power (with its then Lib Dem coalition partners), rather than the start of its administration. The very latest figures, for September this year, show staff numbers have risen very slightly since January 2018, to 10,713 - but that's still well below the January 2013 figure. Claim: The Conservatives have cut fire-and-rescue services by more than Â£300m, losing 23% of their front-line staff. There is some data to support this. Funding for fire services comes from both the central government budget and from local council tax levies. Public-spending records from the Treasury,externalshow in the year 2009-10, which ended a little more than a month before David Cameron became the Conservative prime minister, Â£3.118bn was spent on ""fire-protection services"". The same figure in the 2018-19,externalyear was Â£2.739bn. The difference is Â£379m â tallying with Labour's claim of more than Â£300m having been cut. When it comes to staffing, Labour has not defined what it considers ""front-line staff"" - but again, there is data to support its claim of a 23% cut. The total number of firefighters in England,external- these numbers do not include the rest of the UK - fell from 41,632 in 2010 to 32,233 in 2019. That's a difference of 9,399, or 22.6%. Claim: Firefighter numbers have fallen in South Yorkshire by 25%, West Yorkshire by 36%, Derbyshire by 11%, and Nottinghamshire by 23%. Mr Corbyn was keen to show the flood-hit areas in the north of England had suffered from cuts to fire-and-rescue services. Using the same way of counting staff - full-time-equivalent total firefighters - these numbers are accurate: South Yorkshire saw its numbers fall from 872 to 653 (25.1%) West Yorkshire went from 1,609 to 1,027 (36.2%) Derbyshire's firefighters went from 633 to 562 (11.2%) Nottinghamshire fell from 762 to 590 (22.6%) But there have also been cuts in other parts of the country. Surrey saw its comparable number of full-time equivalent firefighters drop from  725 in 2010 to 542 in 2019 - a fall of 25.2%. Speaking to the BBC's Politics Live programme on Tuesday, Conservative Helen Whately said the claim flooding would be treated differently in the South was unfair, pointing to the prime minister convening a Cobra meeting - or emergency committee. She said: ""Â£2.6bn has been spent on projects to improve flood defences - it's been the number-one priority of the environment agency for the last few years. ""It's been taken very, very seriously."" The Â£2.6bn is the amountthe Environment Agency is planning,externalto have spent on capital projects between April 2015 and March 2021. It aims to protect 300,000 homes. What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

"Today marks one month until election day Labour strongly criticises Boris Johnson's response to flooding in northern England PM holds emergency Cobra meeting on the situation and announces funds so local councils can help affected homes and businesses Lib Dems pledge more funds to prevent flooding in the future if they gain power Politicians from all parties pay tribute to former Labour minister Frank Dobson, following his death aged 79 BBC News is broadcasting from Bishop Auckland in County Durham, a Leave-voting, Labour-held marginal seat Labour says it has suffered a ""sophisticated and large-scale cyber attack on its digital systems"" Policy-wise, Labour sets out a Â£3bn strategy for adult retraining in England The Conservatives continue to attack Jeremy Corbyn's spending plans Nigel Farage says Tories should make way for Brexit Party candidates in seats they cannot hope to win Kate Whannel and Francesca Gillett We're now finishing our live election coverage for today. Thanks for following, and we'll be back tomorrow as the campaigning continues. To read our main story from today,click here. What happened today? Here are the main moments from today: Former Justice Secretary David Gauke has confirmed he will be standing
as an independent candidate at the general election. Mr Gauke, who became the MP for South West Hertfordshire in 2005, had the Tory whip removed after hevoted against Boris Johnson's Brexit deal. He announced he would stand as an independent at the
Political Studies Association awards ceremony tonight. Not all of tomorrow's papers lead with an election story. Among those that do is the Express: The Conservative Party has
suspended party members named in new allegations of Islamophobic social media
posts, allegedly made by 25 current and former Conservative councillors. The Guardian says it has seen a so-called ""dossier"" compiled by an anonymous Twitter user who says they campaign against racism. The dossier contains alleged details of Islamophobia and racist social media content
posted, shared or endorsed by 25 sitting and former Conservative councillors. Not all the names provided are understood to be party members. A Conservative Party
spokesperson said: âAll those found to be party members have been suspended immediately, pending investigation. ""The swift
action we take on not just anti-Muslim discrimination, but discrimination of
any kind, is testament to the seriousness with which we take such issues. âThe Conservative Party
will never stand by when it comes to prejudice and discrimination of any kind. ""Thatâs why we are already establishing the terms of an investigation to make
sure that such instances are isolated and robust processes are in place to
stamp them out as and when they occur.â The Lib Dem candidate in Canterbury, Kent, has decided to pull out of the race, saying he does not want to divide the Remain vote. Tim Walker says the Lib Dems had tried to agree a pact with Labour over the seat, but the talks failed so he made the decision to go himself. But it may not achieve much - as the Lib Dems say they will be selecting a new candidate to contest the seat. Read more here. Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon has spoken during a general election campaign event at Johnstone Town Hall in Renfrewshire. She says Scotland ""stands right now at a crossroads"", and the country ""will have our future imposed on us by the likes of Boris Johnson"" if it does not make its voice heard.

Homes surrounded by water in Fishlake, Doncaster Earlier,the government announcedmeasures to help flood-hit areas in England, following a meeting of the government's emergency Cobra committee. Boris Johnson promised funding for local councils where households and businesses have been affected - equivalent to Â£500 per eligible household - and up to Â£2,500 for small and medium-sized businesses which have suffered severe impacts not covered by insurance. Labour has responded to the flood announcements, saying: ""âToo little, too lateâ isnât even the half of it. ""You canât trust Boris Johnson to look out for the North or the Midlands or protect our communities from flooding,"" said Labour's Jon Trickett. âBut Labour will provide an extra Â£5.6bn in flood defence funding, to level up flood defences over 10 years. âEvery home ruined and every business destroyed demands we act now.â And if you want to read more,here is our Reality Check on whether flood and fire services have been cut. BBC News' digital elections reporter, Joe Tidy, explains more about the cyber attacks which the Labour Party said it has suffered in the past two days. The attacks were DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) which is when ""effectively lots of computers are commandeered to flood a server or a network with too much information, so too many requests, and then that website or server falls over"". ""I always think about buying tickets for Glastonbury,"" he says. ""So many people flood the website at the same time, the website falls over."" He says it's ""very hard to pinpoint exactly who and why they would do this"". But, for ""every pound that is taken away from campaigning to be spent on security is money that could be spent on getting the message out there and getting to voters"", he adds. The estranged wife of former Burton MP Andrew Griffiths has been selected as the Conservative candidate to contest the seat at the general election. Mr Griffiths resigned as a minister last July after a newspaper published sexual messages that he had sent to two barmaids. The parliamentary standards watchdogcleared him of wrongdoing,saying it found no evidence he sent them while he would have been engaged in parliamentary activities. Earlier, Mr Griffiths confirmed he was withdrawing from the selection process after a tied vote last night - and his wife, Kate, would seek selection instead. She'll be defending a majority of more than 10,000. The prime minister leaves the teabag in. That was one revelation that came to light in an election broadcast posted on his Twitter account. The other was that Boris Johnson's favourite band was ""either The Clash or The Rolling Stones"". ""Mainly I listen to the Rolling Stones nowadays, so you can make of that what you will,"" he tells the camera. Richard MossPolitical Editor, BBC Look North If you talk to Labour candidates in seats like Bishop Auckland, they say they are facing two problems. One is Brexit, the other is Jeremy Corbyn. Although the voters on the doorstep like some of Labour's policies, they have personal animosity towards Mr Corbyn. The Tories face challenges too - they thought they were going to make gains in 2017, but they didn't. They underestimated the Labour electoral machine and the history that is here. Their other problem is the Brexit party, which is still standing in seats like this one and could take votes from the Conservatives. The links with Labour are strained here, but are they broken? Conservatives won't take that for granted until the votes are counted. Piers Morgan with his Good Morning Britain co-host Susanna Reid TV presenter Piers Morgan has long been a critic of the so-called ""snowflake"" generation - the derogatory term used to describe younger people by those who view them as more easily-offended or less resilient than older people. But speaking at the annual ITV Palooza event in London tonight, he said he believes the rise of leaders like Boris Johnson and Donald Trump ""is a complete reaction to this PC culture we're now being subjected to"". ""I represent the silent majority who are sick and tired of snowflake central and the PC culture that is now enveloping every part of our lives,"" he said. ""When you spend all your time telling people how to live their lives, the Brits that I know eventually go 'enough'.""  Earlier, it was announced that Steve Bray - the man known for standing in Westminster and shouting ""stop Brexit"" -will stand in the general election. Mr Bray, 50, will contest the Welsh Labour-held constituency of Cynon Valley for the Lib Dems. Mr Bray - who has voted for Labour, the Lib Dems and once for the Tories in previous elections - says his decision to stand for the Lib Dems came after leader Jo Swinson pledged to stop Brexit. Admitting he faces a challenge, he says: ""Its a Labour stronghold. I hope to boost the [Lib Dem] vote in the area. ""As much as I hate to say it, another referendum would just leave divisions. ""If that's what it takes, so be it, but I would rather they put a stop to it at Parliament and they revoke Article 50."" BBC Newsnight's Emily Maitlis joins the team at Brexitcast HQ to talk about an unexpected cameo in the election campaign from former US secretary of state and presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Listen totoday's episode here.  Politicians have taken time out of the campaign trail today to pay tribute to former Labour minister Frank Dobson whohas died aged 79. Mr Dobson was a popular figure in the party and served as health secretary under Tony Blair. Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott called him a ""funny, very kind man"" while Ed Miliband described him as a ""profoundly decent person"". Allow Twitter content?

"A public inquiry is to be held into the circumstances surrounding the death of Sheku Bayoh in police custody. The 32-year-old never regained consciousness after being restrained by police in Kirkcaldy, Fife, in 2015. Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf said the questions to be examined by the inquiry would include whether race played a part in Mr Bayoh's death. On Monday, it was confirmed that no police officers would face prosecution over the case. Mr Bayoh's family said they felt ""betrayed"" by the decision not to prosecute the officers involved, who have always denied any wrongdoing. Mr Yousaf and First Minister Nicola Sturgeon met the family on Tuesday. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf met with the family of Sheku Bayoh Afterwards, Ms Sturgeon tweeted: ""I made clear the Scottish government's determination to get the answers to the questions they have about his death and its aftermath. I believe a full public inquiry is the best way to do that."" The justice secretary announced the inquiry in a statement to the Scottish Parliament. Mr Yousaf  said all deaths in police custody were subject to a mandatory fatal accident inquiry (FAI), but that the Lord Advocate believed this would not allow all the issues to be addressed in this case. FAIs can examine circumstances and factors leading up to a death, but not what follows later. Mr Yousaf said the Lord Advocate had identified questions about the early stages of the post-incident management of the investigation which could not be examined in a fatal accident inquiry. He said: ""That being the case, it is imperative that the circumstances leading up to Mr Bayoh's death and the events that followed, including whether race played a part, are examined in full and in public."" He told the parliament that the primary purpose of the public inquiry would be to investigate the circumstances of the case. Family 'betrayed' over decision not to prosecute officers Fresh questions over death in police custody But he said he had also instructed HM Inspectorate of Prisons to review deaths in prisons. Mr Yousaf said the process of appointing the inquiry's chairperson would begin shortly. Aamer Anwar, the family's lawyer, said: ""It follows that the inquiry must identify each and every individual and organisation who must bear responsibility and accountability for this tragedy and the mishandling of the aftermath. Debrah Cole, the director of Inquest, and lawyer Aamer Anwar joined the Bayoh family for the meeting at Holyrood ""We also believe that the inquiry must focus on whether institutional racism, discrimination, inequality and cultural attitudes were responsible for what occurred. To what extent did the life of Sheku Bayoh not count, or could have counted more? ""These concerns are inescapable as far as many of the core participants are concerned."" Mr Bayoh's family had initially been told in October 2018 that no criminal charges would be brought over his death. However, two months later evidence uncovered by BBC Scotland raised fresh questions about the way he had been treated by police officers before he died in their custody. The Disclosure investigationincluded evidence that the first officers on scene escalated the situation instead of trying to defuse it, and other evidence that Mr Bayoh's actions were exaggerated in official police documents. No prosecutions over Sheku Bayoh death Bayoh family 'devastated' over no charges 'Patience exhausted' on restraint death Restrained man's family to sue police Death in custody family 'keep fighting' Police Scotland Familyâs urgent call for local donor to help former Dundee teacher stave off leukaemia Every destination you can fly to from Edinburgh in 2025 Thursday court round-up â Nightmare neighbour and green baize disrespect Six of Scotland's largest primary schools in East Lothian, new figures reveal Edinburgh Crime: Man, 38, charged and remanded in custody following spate of city centre thefts Police searching for missing 71-year old Fife woman find body at loch LA mayor says winds and drought created 'perfect storm', while officials hit out at looters Biden praises Carter's character as former president's coffin heads to Georgia Henry Zeffman: Market trouble threatens Labour's economic plans The '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty.

"Sarah Barrass, 35, and Brandon Machin, 39, were half-siblings in a secret sexual relationship, police said The parents of six children murdered their two teenage sons the day after a bid to poison them failed. Sarah Barrass and Brandon Machin, who is her half-brother, strangled Tristan and Blake Barrass, aged 13 and 14, in Shiregreen, Sheffield, in May. The court heard how Barrass, 35, would regularly tell her children: ""I gave you life, I can take it away."" Barrass and Machin, 39, were both sentenced to a minimum of 35 years in prison at Sheffield Crown Court. They have both previously admitted murder, conspiracy to murder all six of their children, including Blake and Tristan, and five counts of attempted murder. The court heard how Barrass strangled Tristan with her dressing gown cord, before Machin strangled Blake with his hands. They then put plastic bags over the boys' heads, suffocating them. South Yorkshire Police said Barrass, of Gregg House Road, Shiregreen, and Machin, of Burngreave Road, had been in a secret sexual relationship for years. Blake (left) was strangled by Machin, and Tristan was strangled by Barrass Fearing they would be found out by the authorities and their children taken into care, they hatched a plot to kill them. Police said the plan was for Machin to discover what had happened and raise the alarm. On the evening of 23 May, Barrass tried to poison the four eldest children, by collecting tablets prescribed to one of the children for ADHD and forcing them to swallow them. Kama Melly QC, prosecuting, said: ""None of the children wanted to take the tablets but were forced to do so. ""The defendants expected the tablets to kill the children overnight."" Murder plot survivor 'fears becoming a killer' More stories from around Yorkshire When it became apparent the plan had failed, Barrass began to search online for other ways of killing her children, including suffocation, strangulation and drowning. She contacted Machin to tell him they were still alive and the pair then strangled the boys and placed bin bags over their heads ""to ensure their certain death"", Ms Melly said. The defendants then ran a bath and repeatedly tried to drown one of the younger children. When that too failed, Barrass took the surviving children - two of whom are under the age of 13, and two under three - to the bedroom and phoned the police. Bikers provided an escort for the funeral of Tristan and Blake in August The court heard Barrass had previously approached the local authority to ask for help with her children. Ms Melly said the mother sent a message to a friend which said: ""I've thought of every possible solution to this mess. ""I love my kids too much to kill them, I can't put them into care for the same reason."" Bryan Cox QC, mitigating for Barrass, said she was ""profoundly damaged by her childhood"". He said: ""The defendant was desperate to prevent her children being taken into care. ""She couldn't cope with the prospect of them being removed."" The court heard she told police she planned to kill the younger two children and herself, after the older four had died. Mr Justice Goss, sentencing, said to Barrass: ""You considered your love for them and fear of being parted from them entitled you to take their lives as well as your own."" Speaking after the sentencing, Edmund Hulbert from the Crown Prosecution Service said: ""This was an appalling crime in which two young lives were lost, and a family torn apart, leaving a community in shock. ""Two of the surviving children witnessed their older siblings being attacked and the trauma that all the children have experienced, and will continue to experience, is unimaginable. ""It is paramount now that the surviving children are allowed to rebuild their lives in peace."" Matthew Saunders, a friend of the murdered boys, said outside court: ""A piece of all our hearts died on 24 May 2019, which we will never get back. ""Blake and Tristan leave a huge empty void in our lives, and we did not get chance to say goodbye. ""We are relieved justice has been served, but it should never have come to this.""

"A draft copy of a review into the HS2 high-speed railway linking London and the North of England says it should be built, despite its rising cost. The government-commissioned review, launched in August, will not be published until after the election. It says the project might cost even more than its current price of Â£88bn. Members of the panel which produced the review have told the BBC that the draft recommends that HS2 should be built with only relatively minor alterations. These include reducing the number of trains per hour from 18 to 14, which is in line with other high-speed networks around the world. The document says that even the most controversial stretch of the railway - linking west London to central London - should go ahead. Business leaders and politicians in the North of England have welcomed the review's preliminary findings. But the draft does not have the support of the review's deputy chair, Lord Berkeley. In a letter seen by the BBC, he criticised the review's ""lack of balance"" and said the cost of the scheme had not been properly scrutinised. In the letter, sent to Doug Oakervee, the chairman of the review panel, Lord Berkeley said about the review: ""I cannot support its conclusions or recommendations. ""My concerns are about the process of the report's preparation and its outcome. ""We had to complete the work in a very short time. I also detected a trend in may of the discussions within the review to accept that HS2 will go ahead.... rather than look at the pros and cons of alternative options. ""I reserve the right to publish my own alternative report in due course."" Mr Oakervee said he regretted that Lord Berkeley ""feels unable to give his support."" ""He participated fully in panel discussions that have seen all other members converge their views, based on the extensive evidence considered,"" Mr Oakervee added. Areport in The Times says,externalthat the review found that without HS2, ""large ticket price rises"" would be needed to discourage people from travelling at peak times. HS2 review criticised by deputy chair of panel HS2 must be built in full, say the CBI's regional heads HS2 buys Â£1.25bn of property in London How much will the rail scheme cost? Henri Murison, director of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, said: ""The Northern Powerhouse Independent Review on HS2 said that there were no identified credible alternatives to HS2 in order to deliver the same capacity, and that it has the potential to unlock greater growth in the North and Midlands. ""It is welcome that their recommendations are mirrored by the government's own Oakervee Review."" However, Penny Gaines, chairwoman of the Stop HS2 campaign, said: ""HS2 was a bad project when it was originally announced and was supposed to cost Â£33bn, it was a bad project when it was supposed to cost Â£55bn and it is a bad project now the cost is expected to be more than Â£88bn. ""It should be cancelled as soon as possible, so the government can focus on the real transport priorities.""

"An evacuation has been ordered in Fishlake, South Yorkshire Labour and the Lib Dems have criticised the government for its handling of severe flooding in northern England. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the government's response was ""woeful"" while Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson called for ""long-term policy changes"". Both have urged the prime minister to declare a ""national emergency"" over the floods. Boris Johnson is chairing a meeting of the government's emergency Cobra committee to discuss the situation. The Environment Agency has 30 flood warnings in place as well as five severe warnings on the River Don in South Yorkshire. About 500 homes have been flooded in Doncaster with more than 1,000 properties evacuated in areas hit by the floods. Firefighters have used boats to rescue residents in Fishlake An emergency appeal to support ""displaced"" families has raised more than Â£85,000. Doncaster flooding: Latest updates The Met Office has issuedyellow weather warnings for rain covering large parts of the countryon Tuesday and Thursday. It comes after downpours last week meant several areas were struck by a month's worth of rain in a single day. Hundreds of people in Fishlake, near Doncaster, have fled their homes after the village was submerged and the fire service said it was continuing to rescue people. The next door village of Stainforth has been coming to the aid of those evacuated from their homes. Fred Turner, 71, who has been helping at the community centre in the library, said he had been overwhelmed by the generosity of people. He said someone handed him Â£100 cash for the flood relief fund, and children sold sweets they had collected for Halloween to raise money for victims. ""Those with the least to give have been the kindest,"" he said. Volunteers have been gathering food for those forced to leave their homes He added that the villagers wanted the River Don to be dredged. ""It is a tidal river here, bringing in sand and silt from the Humber, and we have all the water coming off the hills around Sheffield,"" he said. ""At high tides it is coming the other way too and Fishlake is in the middle."" Community rallies to help flood-hit villagers In pictures: Rain floods parts of northern England How do you stop flooding? Speaking at a rally in Blackpool, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the Conservative government's response to the floods had ""been woeful"" and had only been triggered after he had written to Boris Johnson. Mr Corbyn said: ""If this had happened in Surrey instead of Yorkshire and the East Midlands, I think it would have been a very different story."" Jeremy Corbyn met flood victims in South Yorkshire on Saturday Number 10 disputed this, saying the decision to hold a Cobra meeting about the response to flooding had been taken prior to the letter from Mr Corbyn. The flooding situation at the weekend had not reached the level where a national emergency could be officially declared. Chancellor Sajid Javid said the government was ""very concerned"" about the flooding in northern England and ""the impact it's having on the people there"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson visited flood-hit Matlock on Friday Meanwhile, Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson arrived in Stainforth where sheset out plans for a Â£5bn fund to improve flood defencesacross the UK. She said: ""It is wrong that it seems to be just down to the local communities, important though this work is; this is clearly a national emergency and the government should be declaring it as such."" Jo Swinson has called for ""long-term policy changes"" over flooding National Farmers Union (NFU) president Minette Batters said ""seismic change"" was needed to tackle flooding. She said the current situation was an ""absolute disaster"" for farmers and called for a ""reform on how we manage water"", adding that it was a ""wake-up call"" for all politicians. By Dominic Casciani, BBC Home Affairs Correspondent The key legislation that deals with this kind of event does not refer to a ""national emergency"" as such, but only an ""emergency"" - which is an event that threatens ""serious damage to human welfare"", the environment, or is a major attack, such as war or a huge act of terrorism. TheCivil Contingencies Act 2004,externalforces public bodies to prepare for such worst-case scenarios. In the case of the current floods, the Environment Agency, local councils and others are expected to have planned properly and to swing into action. If an emergency is somehow overwhelming, ministers can use the Act to take control and even override existing laws and rules. One of the catalysts for the legislation was a national fuel shortage in 2000 as protesters blockaded refineries over petrol pump prices. Were that to happen today, a prime minister could in theory order the Army to commandeer fuel tankers and keep the nation moving. The Cobra meeting is Whitehall's way of trying to efficiently bring together all the key people in an emergency to co-ordinate the government's response. Four Environment Agency pumps are in Fishlake to remove floodwater from the village. Joe Howslam, 23, told the BBC: ""I live with my parents, brother and sister, but we've all had to move out. ""In the history of Fishlake it's never been this bad, according to some of the older members of our village."" Pam Webb, who owns a spa in Fishlake, described how she lost everything she has worked for after her insurance did not cover flooding. ""I feel really selfish in saying this and I hope that other people aren't in this boat, but I've lost my home and my business and my livelihood that I've worked so hard for."" Many parts of Fishlake remain under 3ft (1m) of water Tractors and boats have been used to get around the village, with many roadsin the area under floodwater. According to the Salvation Army, some people have been rescued from their homes by boat since the early hours of Saturday, but others remain in their properties, while military helicoptershave been used,externalto help boost flood defences in the area. Inside the primary school class with 63 pupils Medieval wall collapses on house and garden Paraplegic amputee gains diving qualification Carol Foster, who lives near the River Don in the village of Kirk Bramwith in South Yorkshire, said she had been completely cut off for five days. ""It's just a huge lake all around me,"" she said. ""I have enough food but it's just, I don't have any power so I only have a log burning stove, which has a flat top so I've been heating you know, pans of milk for hot drinks and water to wash in."" The Environment Agency called in an RAF Chinook late on Sunday In Worksop, hundreds of homes have been evacuated and dozens of businesses have also been badly hit. Susan Hale said the floodwater had ""completely devastated"" her tapas bar. ""The years of hard work and love [have] just gone in a day,"" she said. Flood warnings remain in Lincolnshire where more than 1,000 acres have been flooded and some train lines blocked. Further south, parts of Derbyshire are also still affected by flooding.

"About 500 homes have been flooded in Doncaster with more than 1,000 properties evacuated in areas hit by the rising waters, including the village of Fishlake where residents have complained about the lack of warnings. So what are the factors that have made these floods so damaging, and are they a taste of what the future might bring? Environment correspondent Matt McGrath has been looking at the likely causes of the floods along the Don. There are numerous factors at play, but in essence Fishlake has been caught in a pincer movement with two rivers, the Don and Ea Beck both bursting their banks into an area that was heavily sodden from rain over a period of weeks. Making matters worse is the fact that Fishlake is built on what was once a boggy fenland, that was drained many years ago. ""Fishlake is on the edge of the Great Humberhead levels which was a massive fenland and huge peat bog until the 1700s,"" said Prof Ian Rotherham from Sheffield Hallam University. ""By 1900, almost the entirety had gone. We drained the landscape and we've built on it."" There was a dramatic and sustained downpour last week with South Yorkshire receiving the equivalent of a month of rain in just one day. But the situation was made worse because, according to experts, there was nothing to slow down the flow of the water in the River Don. ""This water is coming from the uplands, it is coming from the Peak District, from the Pennines,"" said Prof Rotherham. ""And what we have had there is the massive removal of peat by cutting, the burning of heather moorland and of course drainage, and instead of holding the water back in the uplands, it shoots downstream. ""All the way along we have straightened the rivers and drained the flood lands. The water rushes down. It is not being held back and it spews out across the lowlands and that's what happened here."" There were severe floods in the Sheffield area back in 2007. Two people died and hundreds were evacuated. In the aftermath, there were significant investments in new defences, with six protection schemes put in place around the city at a cost of Â£83m. It involved the construction of more than 60 new flood protection measures along a five-mile stretch of the River Don. The Environment Agency said that these flood defences managed to significantly reduce the impact of last Thursday's inundation. But defences can only go so far. Too often, severe floods will find the weakest point. ""In Sheffield, the main factories and other areas that were smashed back in 2007 are now protected,"" said Prof Rotherham. ""However, if you are keeping the water out of there, you are moving it faster downstream, and they get smashed even worse."" The Environment Agency examine each flood protection scheme in the light of how it will benefit people and property. Rural areas aren't avoided, but urban areas generally need more protection. ""You might argue that's appropriate as there are more people and properties in urban areas, so it is not necessarily a bad thing,"" said Dr Liz Sharp from the University of Sheffield. ""If you accept it is going to rain more, and we don't have an infinite pot of money, then decisions need to be reached about what the priorities need to be."" Some flood experts say that rural areas are getting a raw deal at the moment. Glass barriers in use in Keswick, Cumbria ""We don't have enough resources to protect all those people in rural areas and that really isn't good enough because those people are just as important as those who live in urban areas,"" said Prof Hannah Cloke, from the University of Reading. ""I think we need to prioritise everyone, we all have the same rights to be protected from floods wherever we live."" The government say they are already investing Â£2.6bn over six years, in more than 1,000 projects to protect 300,000 homes from flooding and coastal erosion. But the view among experts is that there simply isn't enough in the right places at the right time. ""There is a lack of resource in the Environment Agency and in the lead local flood authorities to undertake flood risk analysis and all the warning activities,"" said Prof Cloke. ""So they really are working on a shoestring in certain places. We've really got to sort out the funding so they are working together better. They are thinly staffed in places and that can be a problem in sorting out these issues."" Another challenge is that the funding seems to follow the areas that suffer disasters rather than going to the areas most in need. ""Somerset got a huge amount of publicity for flooding in 2013, but compare that to Hull in 2007 where 8,000 homes were inundated, and really the latter should have been the higher priority,"" said Dr Sharp. ""Attention should be given to where the needs are."" Local residents in Fishlake say that their situation would have been improved if the Don had been dredged. ""It is a tidal river here, bringing in sand and silt from the Humber, and we have all the water coming off the hills around Sheffield,"" Fred Turner, 71, told the BBC. ""At high tides it is coming the other way too and Fishlake is in the middle."" But many experts say that by itself dredging is not enough. ""It can be a good way of moving water from A to B,"" said Dr Liz Sharp from the University of Sheffield. ""But this may cause flooding at B, and this is the challenge with flood walls and dredging. They are just faster at conveying water, the more contemporary approach is to make space for the water."" Dr Sharp gives the example of the Rother Valley Park,  where they have converted land that was once used for mining into a series of lakes that hold back more water when it rains and that has contributed to reducing flood threats in Doncaster. The Environment Agency tends to look after the bigger rivers while there are dozens ofinternal drainage boards,externalthat have responsibility for managing water levels in areas across England. For smaller streams, local authorities usually have responsibility. All this means there is some potential for confusion. ""We have different authorities in charge of different parts of flooding and that can be a problem,"" said Prof Cloke. ""We have seen some steps forward since the flooding in 2007 with the Met Office and Environment Agency working much more closely together and that collaboration has been really valuable."" Local people in Fishlake have complained that they were told that their properties were safe hours before the water rushed in last week. But forecasting the flow of water is very difficult indeed, especially when it gets down to local street level. Often you don't have just have one form of flooding such as a threat from rivers, you also have what's termed surface water flooding where rainwater is unable to drain away. That type of flood often depends on how much rain is falling on a particular place and how much the land is able to absorb. In Fishlake and surrounding areas, there has been heavy rain for weeks, leading to sodden ground. The physical facts of a warming world mean that the air can now hold more moisture. This means that downpours are heavier and likely to cause more flooding. According to the UK Met Office, the amount of rain from extremely wet days in the UK has increased by 17% in the most recent decade (2008-2017) compared to 1961-1990. There are things we can do to ensure that we adapt to cope with changes we are now seeing. ""We can have earlier warnings to get people out of the way, so they know what to do to protect their homes and businesses,"" said Hannah Cloke. ""We can retro-fit houses so they are more resilient to floods, and if we have to build on the flood plain, if there is nowhere else to build, then we can do it cleverly - by building on stilts and making those properties safe to live in."" ""Yes it is a foretaste of the future,"" said Dr Liz Sharp. ""It will happen in different places, we need to be expecting this to happen more often."" Other experts agree that the future environment will be a challenge. ""We're running behind with climate change - we need to really speed up if we are going to keep on top of the problems that are being exacerbated by the change in the climate,"" said Prof Cloke. ""We don't really have the right infrastructure in place for the next 25 years to 50 years and that is very frightening.""

"Former chief of the Armed Forces Lord Bramall has died at the age of 95. The Normandy D-Day veteran, who oversaw the Falklands campaign, retired from the House of Lords in 2013. Lord Bramall was awarded a military cross in 1945 for his bravery during World War Two. In his later years, he was falsely accused in 2014 of child sexual abuse by the paedophile and fantasist Carl Beech. He was too ill to attend the trial of Beech in person earlier this year. Beech was later jailed for making the false allegations. Lord Bramall's wife died in 2015 before detectives announced they were not charging him. A field marshal and baron, Lord Bramall served during the Normandy landings and commanded UK land forces between 1976 and 1978. He became chief of the general staff - the professional head of the Army - in 1979, and in 1982 he oversaw the Falklands campaign. Later that year he became chief of the defence staff - the most senior officer commanding the UK's armed forces - and served until 1985. He went on to have a 26-year career in the House of Lords. Lord Bramall -known to his family and friends,externalas Dwin, from his first name Edwin - spoke out in the House of Lords against the involvement of the UK in the Iraq war. During a debate in 2004,he said:,external""We really should know by now that, unlike naked aggression, terrorism cannot be defeated by massive military means, but by concentrating more on the twin pillars of competent protection and positive diplomacy."" He also spoke out against the UK's nuclear missiles,telling the Lords,externalin 2007 that abandoning Trident ""could be seen as a bold and striking decision intended to show that the country is resolved to return to the position of moral and ethical standards for which it was once widely recognised"". The Campaign for Nuclear Disarmamentpraised,externalLord Bramall over his comments. Also paying tribute was former defence minister Tobias Ellwood,who tweeted,externalthat Lord Bramall had been an ""inspirational leader"". Ex-defence secretary Lord Heseltine called him an ""outstanding soldier"", adding: ""From his earliest experiences in the liberation of Europe and the D-Day landings, to his distinguished tenure as chief of the defence staff, he was a man who inspired confidence. ""His public humiliation following the scandalous allegations was one of the most disgraceful episodes of my political life. ""The country has lost a great patriot who deserved better from us."" Former Conservative MP Harvey Proctor, who was also wrongly accused by Beech, paid tribute to Lord Bramall and said the country was ""poorer for his death"". ""He will be remembered as a military leader of enormous stature, courage and ability,"" Mr Proctor said. Lord Bramall will be remembered as a war hero, despite the false claims towards the end of his life. He joined the Army at the age of 18 and took part in the D-Day landings. In Normandy, he was wounded twice but quickly returned to duty. For his bravery he was awarded the military cross. He served in Borneo and then west Germany at the height of the Cold War as he rose through the ranks. By the time of the Falklands War he  was the head of the Army. He retired in 1985 as a field marshal. He was still respected as a strategic thinker - warning of the dangers of the Iraq invasion in 2003. He also questioned the cost of renewing Britain's Trident nuclear weapons system. His reputation still survived, despite what he called the ridiculous allegations made by a fantasist who wrongly claimed he was  part of an establishment paedophile ring. Paying tribute to Lord Bramall, chief of the defence staff General Sir Nick Carter said his ""many admirers"" would be ""deeply saddened"" to hear of his death. ""He was a remarkable soldier who served our country with great bravery and dedication over many decades, inspiring his many subordinates, and overseeing significant change as a chief of staff that we still benefit from today,"" he said. Meanwhile, Conservative parliamentary candidate Nigel Evans focused on the impact of the false allegations,tweeting:,external""I trust more than a few people will hang their heads in shame following this news. He deserved so much better from the police. RIP Lord Bramall."" The BBC's home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani said Lord Bramall's last years were ""dominated"" by Operation Midland, the Metropolitan Police's probe into Beech's false claims. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick said she was ""very sad"" to learn of his death. ""I met him recently to apologise personally for the great damage the Metropolitan Police investigation into Carl Beech's false allegations has had on him and his family,"" she said in a statement. ""I was struck by his selflessness and generosity in the issues he wanted to discuss, focusing on a desire to ensure the lessons from Operation Midland had been learnt by the Met. ""It was very humbling to be in his company and hear first-hand his experience. ""He was a great man, a brilliant soldier and leader, and much-loved family man. He was a true gentleman and will be hugely missed."" Lord Bramall, a father-of-two, thumped the desk and called the allegations ""ridiculous"" when he was questioned by police in 2015. Footage of his police interview, which happened weeks after his home was raided, was played at Beech's trial. ""I am absolutely astonished, amazed and bemused,"" Lord Bramall said in that interview. ""I find it incredible that anybody should believe that someone of my career standing, integrity, should be capable of any of these things, including things like torture - unbelievable.""

"Joseph McCann is accused of 37 offences against 11 alleged victims A man embarked on a series of ""depraved"" sex attacks on women and children, one as young as 11, a court has heard. Joseph McCann is accused of 37 offences against 11 alleged victims, including rapes, kidnap and false imprisonment, over two weeks in April and May. The Old Bailey heard the 34-year-old snatched two women off London streets and told one he would ""never release her"" as he raped her multiple times. Mr McCann of Harrow denies the charges. The jury was told the defendant's ""spree of sex attacks"" started in Watford before continuing in London, Greater Manchester and Cheshire. One 21-year-old woman was grabbed at knifepoint and bundled into a car as she walked home from a Watford nightclub on 21 April. Prosecutor John Price QC said she was released later that morning in a ""state of great distress"". A 25-year-old woman was abducted as she walked home in Walthamstow, east London, just after midnight on 25 April. Mr Price said the defendant told her ""to stop screaming or he would stab her"" then dragged her into a car ""and drove off"". The court heard the woman was raped ""many times"" by Mr McCann in various locations over the next 14 hours and subjected to acts of ""shocking depravity and violence"". ""He made her call him 'daddy' and say that she was a child. At one point the man parked the car near to a school, saying that he wanted to make her rape a child,"" Mr Price said. Later the same day, and while still holding the woman prisoner, the defendant abducted a 21-year-old woman in Edgware, north London, as she walked along the street with her sister, the court heard. CCTV of the woman being bundled into a silver people carrier just after midday was played to the jury. Mr Price said she ""suffered a similar fate"" to the 25-year-old woman before the pair managed to escape while in Watford where Mr McCann had booked a hotel room for two nights. He told the jury they would have come to ""further harm"" but one of the women hit their captor over the head with a vodka bottle and some builders ""bravely"" intervened to prevent them being recaptured. The attacks resumed 10 days later in the North West of England where, over 12 hours on 5 May, three women, three young girls and a boy of 11 were assaulted, the Old Bailey heard. Mr McCann allegedly conned his way into a mother's Greater Manchester home where he tied her to the bed and raped her 17-year-old daughter and 11-year-old son. The court heard he then abducted a 71-year-old woman who was in her car at a Morrisons car park. He raped her and also sexually assaulted a 13-year-old girl before both managed to escape at Knutsford Service Station on the M6, the court heard. The 34-year-old is accused of then snatching two 14-year-old girls in Cheshire. Mr McCann, who was not in court, is charged with: Ten counts of false imprisonment Seven counts of rape One count of rape of a child Two counts of causing or inciting a person to engage in sexual activity without consent Seven counts of kidnap One count of attempted kidnap Three counts of causing or inciting a child under 13 to engage in sexual activity Three counts of assault by penetration One count of sexual assault Two counts of committing a sexual offence with intent The trial continues.

"Neil McEvoy said he used a mobile phone to make the recordings Police have launched an inquiry after a politician made secret recordings of the man who was in charge of overseeing three complaints about him. Welsh Assembly Member Neil McEvoy claimed his recordings ofstandards commissioner,externalSir Roderick Evans revealed sexism and bias. Sir Roderick,who resigned on Monday, said much of what had been shared was out of context and misleading. Independent AM Mr McEvoy said he had acted lawfully. South Wales Police said it had ""commenced an investigation following a referral from the National Assembly for Wales concerning allegations of covert recordings"". Mr McEvoy's actions prompted a security sweep of the assembly estate. Neil McEvoy expelled from Plaid Cymru for 18 months Who is Neil McEvoy? Neil McEvoy faces ""bullying"" probe Opening assembly business on Tuesday, presiding officer Elin Jones said police had been asked to look into how the recordings were made and investigate their legality. ""The covert recording of private conversations on the assembly estate is a serious breach of trust,"" she said. She alleged the recordings included confidential evidence by a witness during an investigation into Mr McEvoy's conduct. Assembly authorities have begun the process of finding an acting commissioner and Ms Jones told the assembly no complaints would be dropped as a result of Sir Roderick's resignation. Mr McEvoy recorded hearings held by the commissioner as he conducted his investigation into the former Plaid Cymru AM, using a mobile phone he said was either in his jacket, bag or on a table. They recorded conversations held while the South Wales Central AM was out of the room and others on the recordings were unaware he had made them. Sir Roderick Evans had been standards commissioner since 2017 Mr McEvoy defended his secret recordings of Sir Roderick and his staff in a press conference on Tuesday. Accusing Sir Roderick of presiding over a ""locker room culture"", he claimed the commissioner aired ""really sexist views"" about ""female lawyers who - of course because they're female - they're emotional"". He added: ""There was a provocative and politically incorrect culture in the commissioner's office that came across through the recordings."" Mr McEvoy alleged he heard a joke made about women politicians and a comment that former Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood should ""wind her neck in"". Sir Roderick, a former high court judge and pro-chancellor of Swansea University, previously said Mr McEvoy's conduct was ""wholly unacceptable"" and ""undermines the integrity of the complaints procedure"". The office of the standards commissioner had no further comment to make about Mr McEvoy's press conference. The controversy erupted in the assembly chamber on Tuesday, when Brexit Party Senedd leader Mark Reckless was told by Ms Jones to stop quoting from a transcript of the recordings. She also demanded he withdraw an accusation that she was biased, to which he replied: ""The truth or otherwise of the allegation, I withdraw it."" Elin Jones said no complaints would be dropped as a result of Sir Roderick's resignation He faces three investigations - one relating to Â£5,000 of building work on his constituency office. In a transcript of the recordings released to the media by Mr McEvoy's office, Sir Roderick is reported saying the authenticity of two quotes ""couldn't be demonstrated"". ""We have to consider if they are forgeries or whatever, [and] whether he should be reported to the police,"" he added. Mr McEvoy said he had taken the cheapest quote available: ""The quotes were nothing to do with me. I took them in good faith."" He said the builder was ""just somebody that I knew."" The second matter was about him losing his temper with Labour AM Mick Antoniw - he admitted being ""aggressive to him,"" but felt Mr Antoniw was arrogant. ""If the individual was really offended by my behaviour, and he was upset by it, then I apologise to Mick,"" he added. He also faced an allegation hemisused assembly funds for political campaigning. Dismissing this, Mr McEvoy said: ""Strange that, isn't it, a Plaid Cymru member using his office for the benefit of Plaid Cymru."" He was a Plaid Cymru member until 2018,when he was expelled.

"A public inquiry is to be held into the circumstances surrounding the death of Sheku Bayoh in police custody. The 32-year-old never regained consciousness after being restrained by police in Kirkcaldy, Fife, in 2015. Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf said the questions to be examined by the inquiry would include whether race played a part in Mr Bayoh's death. On Monday, it was confirmed that no police officers would face prosecution over the case. Mr Bayoh's family said they felt ""betrayed"" by the decision not to prosecute the officers involved, who have always denied any wrongdoing. Mr Yousaf and First Minister Nicola Sturgeon met the family on Tuesday. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf met with the family of Sheku Bayoh Afterwards, Ms Sturgeon tweeted: ""I made clear the Scottish government's determination to get the answers to the questions they have about his death and its aftermath. I believe a full public inquiry is the best way to do that."" The justice secretary announced the inquiry in a statement to the Scottish Parliament. Mr Yousaf  said all deaths in police custody were subject to a mandatory fatal accident inquiry (FAI), but that the Lord Advocate believed this would not allow all the issues to be addressed in this case. FAIs can examine circumstances and factors leading up to a death, but not what follows later. Mr Yousaf said the Lord Advocate had identified questions about the early stages of the post-incident management of the investigation which could not be examined in a fatal accident inquiry. He said: ""That being the case, it is imperative that the circumstances leading up to Mr Bayoh's death and the events that followed, including whether race played a part, are examined in full and in public."" He told the parliament that the primary purpose of the public inquiry would be to investigate the circumstances of the case. Family 'betrayed' over decision not to prosecute officers Fresh questions over death in police custody But he said he had also instructed HM Inspectorate of Prisons to review deaths in prisons. Mr Yousaf said the process of appointing the inquiry's chairperson would begin shortly. Aamer Anwar, the family's lawyer, said: ""It follows that the inquiry must identify each and every individual and organisation who must bear responsibility and accountability for this tragedy and the mishandling of the aftermath. Debrah Cole, the director of Inquest, and lawyer Aamer Anwar joined the Bayoh family for the meeting at Holyrood ""We also believe that the inquiry must focus on whether institutional racism, discrimination, inequality and cultural attitudes were responsible for what occurred. To what extent did the life of Sheku Bayoh not count, or could have counted more? ""These concerns are inescapable as far as many of the core participants are concerned."" Mr Bayoh's family had initially been told in October 2018 that no criminal charges would be brought over his death. However, two months later evidence uncovered by BBC Scotland raised fresh questions about the way he had been treated by police officers before he died in their custody. The Disclosure investigationincluded evidence that the first officers on scene escalated the situation instead of trying to defuse it, and other evidence that Mr Bayoh's actions were exaggerated in official police documents. No prosecutions over Sheku Bayoh death Bayoh family 'devastated' over no charges 'Patience exhausted' on restraint death Restrained man's family to sue police Death in custody family 'keep fighting' Police Scotland Familyâs urgent call for local donor to help former Dundee teacher stave off leukaemia Every destination you can fly to from Edinburgh in 2025 Thursday court round-up â Nightmare neighbour and green baize disrespect Six of Scotland's largest primary schools in East Lothian, new figures reveal Edinburgh Crime: Man, 38, charged and remanded in custody following spate of city centre thefts Police searching for missing 71-year old Fife woman find body at loch LA mayor says winds and drought created 'perfect storm', while officials hit out at looters Biden praises Carter's character as former president's coffin heads to Georgia Henry Zeffman: Market trouble threatens Labour's economic plans The '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty.

"Zia Uddin kept condoms in the control room where he sexually assaulted the girls A Primark security guard has been found guilty of sexually assaulting teenage girls he accused of shoplifting. Zia Uddin, 27, from east London, attacked four 15-year-old girls while working at the Kingston store in 2017. Uddin threatened the teenagers with calling the police and their parents if they did not perform sexual acts on him in the control room of the store. He was convicted of one count of rape and four counts of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity. Kingston Crown Court heard Uddin's colleagues had noticed his strange behaviour, which included making requests to delete CCTV, and not properly completing paperwork on shoplifting. He was also known to keep condoms in the control room, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said. Once detained, some victims offered to pay for the items they had stolen, suggested they could work in the store to make amends, or even never enter the shop again. Zia Uddin knew where the ""blind spots"" were on the Kingston branch's CCTV However, once alone in the back office, Uddin, from Manor Park in Newham, made clear he was only interested in sexual acts in exchange for letting them go. Prosecutors said one girl only did as he asked because ""there was no other choice"" and it was the only way out of the situation. Graham Partridge, from the CPS, said Uddin ""preyed on young girls in a vulnerable situation"". ""He abused his authority by telling them to perform sexual acts for him on the promise they would then be released without their parents or the police being informed about what they had done. ""Having worked in security, Uddin was also well aware of the CCTV camera 'blind spots' and took advantage of these in order to carry out his offending."" He added that Uddin claimed all the victims were liars and refused to take responsibility for his actions. Uddin will be sentenced next Tuesday. A spokeswoman for Primark said: ""This has been a horrendous ordeal for the victims and their families and we are truly sorry for what they have suffered. Our thoughts are very much with them. ""The nature of these offences is shocking and distressing. ""Zia Uddin abused the trust that was placed in him by his employer, Brooknight Security, and by us, by taking advantage of his victims, who were young and vulnerable.""

"Chris Davies had been an MP since 2015 but was unseated by a petition after admitting submitting two false expenses invoices A former MP who lost his seat following a conviction for a false expenses claim has quit the general election after briefly becoming the Conservative candidate for Ynys Mon. Chris Davies pulled out after other Welsh Tories criticised his selection. ""I will not want to put my wife and family through any more distress,"" the former Brecon and Radnorshire MP said. A senior Welsh Conservative source told the BBC the campaign had been ""shaky to say the least"". ""The candidate selection has been seriously flawed and chaotic,"" the source added. Another claimed a Conservative AM had been approached to stand in Ynys Mon on Wednesday - the approach was rejected. Brecon and Radnorshire by-elections past By-election loss for Tories cut majority Tory MP pleads guilty to false expenses claim Announcing his decision to withdraw from the election, Mr Davies said: ""Given the reaction in the media to the idea of me being a candidate, I have decided to pull out of the selection process."" Conservative AM Nick Ramsay said Mr Davies had ""done the right thing"". ""As John Major once said, when the curtain falls, it's time to leave the stage,"" he tweeted. It leaves Ynys Mon without a Tory candidate, with the deadline for candidate selection on Thursday. Mr Davies lost a by-election in Brecon and Radnorshire triggered by a recall petition earlier this year. Headmitted two charges of a false expenses claim in Marchat Westminster Magistrates' Court after trying to split the cost of Â£700 worth of pictures between two office budgets by creating fake invoices, when he could have claimed the amount by other means. Mr Davies made an ""unreserved apology"" and was ordered to complete 50 hours of unpaid work and was fined Â£1,500. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

News of his selection for Ynys Mon broke on Tuesday night, prompting incredulity from Angela Burns, Welsh Conservative AM for Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire. Claiming Mr Davies had been imposed by the party, she said: ""You couldn't make it up."" ""It is inexplicable,"" another Welsh Conservative source said. Mr Davies had tried and failed to win selection as the general election candidate in Brecon and Radnorshire again before the Ynys Mon selection was made. Chris Davies apologised after his conviction But Mr Davies withdrew after he realised he would not be able to command support on Anglesey, the source claimed. One Conservative told BBC Wales there was a ""feeling within the party that Chris Davies had paid the penalty and deserved another try"". However there had been ""huge resistance"" from within the party locally and that is why Mr Davies had withdrawn, the source added, realising he would not be able to command support in Anglesey. The local party were only made aware of his selection on Tuesday, the source said. Lord Davies of Gower, Welsh Conservative chairman, had defended the selection before Mr Davies quit, saying: ""Chris made a mistake and has paid the price. He must now be allowed to move on."" The constituency of Ynys Mon includes the island of Anglesey and the smaller Holy Island. The Conservatives held the seat - previously known as Anglesey - between 1979 and 1987, followed by Plaid Cymru until 2001, and since then by Labour. Labour has selected Mary Roberts for the 12 December poll, while Plaid Cymru has picked Aled ap Dafydd. The Brexit Party intends to stand Helen Jenner. Ms Roberts said: ""Chris Davies has rightly withdrawn. The Welsh Conservatives are in complete disarray."" Plaid's candidate said: ""For the Tories to consider that he was suitable in the first place shows how out of touch they are."" Deputy leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats Baroness Christine Humphreys said the Conservatives had ""demonstrated their utter contempt"" for Ynys Mon voters.

"Mr Bray is popular with anti-Brexit activists but less so with broadcasters - whose interviews he frequently interrupts Anti-Brexit campaigner Steve Bray is to stand for Parliament for the Lib Dems. The activist is a familiar figure in Westminster where he regularly bellows his 'Stop Brexit' message through a megaphone outside the House of Commons. He has been selected to fight the seat of Cynon Valley in south Wales. It has been held by Labour for more than 30 years but its longstanding MP Ann Clwyd has retired and is not standing again. The Lib Dems have vowed to cancel Brexit if they win power. The party's leader Jo Swinson dismissed suggestions Mr Bray's candidacy was a stunt, saying the Lib Dems needed people prepared to put themselves on the line to stop the UK leaving the EU. ""He cannot be accused of not being committed to his cause,"" she said. ""To have candidates who care so passionately about that is a positive."" Who are the Stop Brexit campaigners? Mr Bray, a rare coins dealer from Port Talbot, has spent every day since September 2017 protesting opposite Parliament, where his anti-Brexit antics having become a tourist attraction in their own right. He and fellow protesters who he met through an anti-Brexit Facebook group also stage a daily evening vigil outside nearby Downing Street. The 50-year-old says Brexit is a ""wrong turn"" for the country and must be stopped. Mr Bray has come face-to-face with the likes of Jeremy Corbyn Mr Bray would appear to have little chance in Cynon Valley, where the Lib Dems polled only 585 votes in 2017, finishing fifth behind UKIP. Wales, as a whole, voted to leave the EU in 2016 but the Lib Dems have made gains there in recent times, winning the seat of Brecon and Radnorshire in a by-election in August. The Lib Dems have formed a loose electoral pact with other anti-Brexit parties, including Plaid Cymru, which will see the parties not fielding candidates in some of their respective target seats to try and maximise the pro-Remain vote, Plaid Cymru has already selected a candidate in Cynon Valley, where it came third in 2017. Ms Clwyd retained Cynon Valley with a majority of more than 13,000 in 2017, having represented the seat since winning a by-election in 1984.  Labour has selected Bethan Winter to fight the seat.

"Britain's withdrawal from the European Union - Brexit - is seen by many voters as a key issue in this general election. Here, we answer a selection of readers' questions about the two subjects. At their party conference in September 2019,Liberal Democrats voted for a motionsaying that if the party became the government at the next general election, it wouldrevoke Article 50. This is part of EU law which gives any country the right to leave the EU. According to a2018 ruling by the European Court of Justice,external(ECJ), the UK could do this on its own, without asking the other 27 EU members, by writing a letter to the European Council, a body made up of EU heads of state or government. The ECJ added that after revocation, the UK would remain an EU member on the same terms as it has now. The government hasruled out forming an election pact with Brexit Party during the election campaign.But if the Conservatives fell short of a majority, and the Brexit Party won a handful of crucial seats - then it may choose to support the Conservatives on specific issues in order to get Brexit over the line. So a temporary alliance of convenience is probably more likely than a formal coalition government. At thelaunch of the Liberal Democrats' general election campaign, the party's leader, Jo Swinson, said she was ""absolutely, categorically ruling out Lib Dem votes putting Jeremy Corbyn in No 10"". And,speaking at a Unite union conferencein Scotland in October 2019, Jeremy Corbyn vowed that there would be ""no pacts with any other party, we are fighting that election to win it in every part of the UK"". So, the parties have been very clear about not wanting to enter coalitions - or other types of agreement. But in a hung Parliament, where no party has a majority of seats in the House of Commons, it's possible that they could reconsider that position. The convention is that the prime minister is an MP and the leader of the largest party in the House of Commons. However, in years gone by, many prime ministers were members of the House of Lords. The last of these was Lord Salisbury, who left office in 1902. And in 1963, the 14th Earl of Home, later Sir Alec Douglas-Home, left the House of Lords within a few days of being appointed PM. He was elected to the House of Commons in a by-election. However, a Brexit Party majority looks distinctly unlikely, after it announced itwould no longer field candidates in more than 300 Tory seats. More Your Questions Answered: Is my postal vote safe? General election 2019: Will this be a Brexit election? Brexit: All you need to know about the UK leaving the EU A really simple guide to the general election More news explainers Labour iscommitted to holding another referendumon whether to leave the EU. If the country voted to Remain, then free movement between the UK and EU would continue. Even if Brexit happens, Labour may try to retain free movement, which means British and EU citizens would still be able to live and work in whichever country they choose. A motion to that effect was passedat the 2019 Labour Party conference,but we need to wait for Labour's election manifesto to see if it also becomes a formal policy pledge. It is highly unlikely that visas will be introduced, unless relations between the UK and EU deteriorate dramatically. But it partly depends on whether the UK leaves the EU with a deal or not. Leaving with a deal will probably mean that both sides agree travel between the two will not require a visa. But if there was a no-deal Brexit, the UK would immediately be treated by the EU as a ""third country"", making it equivalent to other non-EU states. In that scenario, it will be down to the UK and individual EU member countries to decide whether visas are needed for travel between them. If there is a no-deal Brexit, the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland will become the land border between the UK and the EU. This means each will have different regulations and customs rules. The EU insists that the Irish government would have to take stepsto protect the integrity of the single market,an agreement which allows goods, people, services and money to move around between countries that are a part of it. It says it wants to prevent products which do not meet EU standards arriving from the UK. This means some checks would have to take place. What is not clear is how exactly this would happen. To date, the government has set aside Â£6.3bn for Brexit planning. The previous chancellor, Philip Hammond,had made available Â£4.2bnfor Brexit preparations from mid-2016, including recruiting more civil service staff. In August 2019, Mr Hammond's successor, Sajid Javid, saidan extra Â£2.1bn of funding would be made availableto prepare for the possibility of a no-deal Brexit, including more border force officers and upgrades to transport infrastructure at ports. Businesses have also spent a huge amount of money preparing for Brexit, but it is hard to put a precise figure on how much has been spent in the private sector. Yes, the transition period - the time between the UK leaving the EU with a deal and and finally quitting it altogether under the terms of a new relationship - can be extended. While the proposed transition period will run until the end of December 2020, it can in theory be extended by one or two years. The government, though, has insisted that it will not ask for any extension of the deadline. It meansthat if no free trade agreement is completed in time,then the UK might have to trade with the EU onthe most basic World Trade Organization rulesfrom the beginning of 2021.

"This video can not be played Evo Morales spoke to the press after being granted political asylum in Mexico Former Bolivian President Evo Morales has arrived in Mexico City saying he asked for asylum because his life was in danger. Mr Morales resigned on Sunday after weeks of protests over a disputed presidential election result. The Mexican jet carrying him landed at an airport in Mexico City, where he gave a brief news conference. Mr Morales said he was forced to stand down but did so willingly ""so there would be no more bloodshed"". He said a price of $50,000 (Â£38,000) had been put on his head by ""coup plotters"". The left-wing leader said he and the Bolivian government were ""very grateful"" to Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, whom he credited with saving his life. Highs and lows of Evo Morales' presidency Conflict fills political vacuum after Morales Why protesters are on the streets worldwide ""While I have life I'll stay in politics, the fight continues. All the people of the world have the right to free themselves from discrimination and humiliation,"" he added. Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard said Mr Morales had arrived ""safely"" in the country, tweeting a picture of the jet that carried him. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Morales, a former coca farmer, was first elected in 2006, the country's first leader from the indigenous community. He has won plaudits for fighting poverty and improving Bolivia's economy but drew controversy by defying constitutional limits to run for a fourth term in October's election. The poll is alleged to have been rife with irregularities. Smiling and raising his fist in the air, Mr Morales appeared relaxed as he exited the plane at Mexico City's international airport âªat around 11:15 local time (âª17:10 GMTâ¬). But Mr Morales's upbeat demeanour belied the difficulties of his journey to Mexico from the Bolivian city of Cochabamba, where he had sought refuge. The Mexican Air Force jet sent to pick up Mr Morales first stopped off in Peru, where it refuelled and waited for permission to enter Bolivian airspace. Once on the ground in Bolivia, however, Peru told the plane that ""for political reasons"" it would not be allowed fly back to the country to refuel. This is when the Mexican government had to come up with a plan B, Mexico's foreign minister said. ""That was very difficult and very tense, because there was a complicated situation at the airport where Evo Morales was waiting,"" Mr Ebrard said. After negotiations with several countries in the region, the plane was granted permission to refuel in Paraguay before it flew to Mexico via Brazil and Peru. The deputy head of the Senate, Jeanine ÃÃ±ez, has declared herself interim president by right of succession despite a boycott by Mr Morales' party. Jeanine ÃÃ±ez proclaimed herself interim president She promised to bring peace to the country and hold elections as soon as possible. Members of the security forces remove debris from a barricade as they patrol the streets in La Paz As Mr Morales prepared to leave for Mexico, unrest again erupted on the streets of the Bolivian administrative capital, La Paz, with angry supporters of the socialist leader clashing with security forces. Bolivia's military commander ordered troops to support the police, who urged residents to stay indoors in a bid to quell the violence. On Tuesday, Bolivia's main federation of unions warned it would hold an indefinite strike if the country's leaders did not restore constitutional order and peace within 24 hours. Pressure had been growing on Mr Morales since his narrow victory in last month's presidential election. The result was called into question by the Organization of American States, a regional body, which had found ""clear manipulation"" and called for the result to be annulled. In response, Mr Morales agreed to hold fresh elections. But his main rival, Carlos Mesa - who came second in the vote - said Mr Morales should not stand in any new vote. This video can not be played Watch Evo Morales announce his resignation The chief of the armed forces, Gen Williams Kaliman, then urged Mr Morales to step down in the interests of peace and stability. Announcing his resignation, Mr Morales said he had taken the decision in order to stop fellow socialist leaders from being ""harassed, persecuted and threatened"". He also called his removal a ""coup"".

"Sajid Javid says Labour would ""massively increase borrowing and debt"", and ""hike up taxes"" The Conservatives have launched a fresh attack on what they say are Labour's ""reckless"" spending plans. Labour has yet to publish its election manifesto but the Tories have claimed that there is a ""black hole"" in its economic policies. The Tories have tried to calculate the additional taxes they believe a Labour government would have to introduce if they win power on 12 December. Labour has dismissed the figures as ""more fake news"" from Tory HQ. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell insisted an incoming Labour government would not raise VAT or national insurance, while 95% of people would not pay any more in income tax. Live: Latest election news Personal tax rises would be confined to the top 5% of earners, he said - a policy carried overfrom its 2017 manifesto. Both main parties are planning to borrow money to spend on infrastructure projects if they win the general election, while Labour has said it will pay for some of its spending pledges by reversing Conservative reductions in corporation tax. Chancellor Sajid Javid claimed that Labour would also ""hike up taxes"" to pay for its programme, estimating that this would amount to an extra Â£2,400 per year for every taxpayer. ""The British people have made huge progress over the last decade in repairing the damage left to us by the last Labour government,"" he said. ""If Jeremy Corbyn gets into power he would throw all that hard work away."" The Conservatives are repeatingtheir previous claimthat Labour plans to spend Â£1.2tn over the next five years, which forms the basis of this new claim. But this is problematic because it makes a number of assumptions about what Labour intends to spend before it has published a manifesto. Not only have those same assumptions been repeated in this analysis, but additional ones have been made about Labour's tax-raising plans. For example, the Conservatives say Labour is considering a ""homes tax"" which would cost households up to Â£375 more than the current Council Tax system, raising an extra Â£10.2bn. However, this seems to be based on a policy-proposal document put forward by Guardian columnist George Monbiot and commissioned for the Labour Party. Thesummary of the paper,externaleven states: ""The following are proposals to the Labour Party, which will consider these as part of its policy development process in advance of the next general election."" To get to the Â£2,400 figure, the Conservatives have assumed Labour intends to spend Â£651bn on day-to-day spending (which comes from their original Â£1.2tn calculation) over five years. From there, the Conservatives say that Labour only plans to raise Â£277bn over the same period, leaving a shortfall of Â£374bn. So, if you then divide the shortfall by 31.2m UK taxpayers, you arrive at Â£2,400 a year each (or Â£12,000 per taxpayer over five years) to plug the gap. In summary, this analysis is based on assumptions about money Labour intends to spend but also how much revenue the party intends to raise. Until the manifestos are published, it is impossible to accurately identify any spending gaps. BBC political correspondent Chris Mason said the Conservatives' attack was part of a clear attempt to build an argument about what they call the ""cost of Corbyn"". But asked how much another Conservative government would cost taxpayers during a BBC interview, Chief Secretary to the Treasury Rishi Sunak did not provide a figure. ""The forecasts that there are from the OBR (Office for Budget Responsibility) show that there is a Â£30bn surplus on the current balance over the next few years - so we take in Â£30bn more than is spent on day-to-day spending,"" he told Radio 4's Today. ""We've said we will invest about Â£13.5bn of that on people's priorities like the NHS, like schools, like policing. We will not tax people extra for those day to day priorities."" Mr McDonnell said the Tories were unable to say how they would pay for their spending commitments. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"An evacuation has been ordered in Fishlake, South Yorkshire Labour and the Lib Dems have criticised the government for its handling of severe flooding in northern England. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the government's response was ""woeful"" while Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson called for ""long-term policy changes"". Both have urged the prime minister to declare a ""national emergency"" over the floods. Boris Johnson is chairing a meeting of the government's emergency Cobra committee to discuss the situation. The Environment Agency has 30 flood warnings in place as well as five severe warnings on the River Don in South Yorkshire. About 500 homes have been flooded in Doncaster with more than 1,000 properties evacuated in areas hit by the floods. Firefighters have used boats to rescue residents in Fishlake An emergency appeal to support ""displaced"" families has raised more than Â£85,000. Doncaster flooding: Latest updates The Met Office has issuedyellow weather warnings for rain covering large parts of the countryon Tuesday and Thursday. It comes after downpours last week meant several areas were struck by a month's worth of rain in a single day. Hundreds of people in Fishlake, near Doncaster, have fled their homes after the village was submerged and the fire service said it was continuing to rescue people. The next door village of Stainforth has been coming to the aid of those evacuated from their homes. Fred Turner, 71, who has been helping at the community centre in the library, said he had been overwhelmed by the generosity of people. He said someone handed him Â£100 cash for the flood relief fund, and children sold sweets they had collected for Halloween to raise money for victims. ""Those with the least to give have been the kindest,"" he said. Volunteers have been gathering food for those forced to leave their homes He added that the villagers wanted the River Don to be dredged. ""It is a tidal river here, bringing in sand and silt from the Humber, and we have all the water coming off the hills around Sheffield,"" he said. ""At high tides it is coming the other way too and Fishlake is in the middle."" Community rallies to help flood-hit villagers In pictures: Rain floods parts of northern England How do you stop flooding? Speaking at a rally in Blackpool, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the Conservative government's response to the floods had ""been woeful"" and had only been triggered after he had written to Boris Johnson. Mr Corbyn said: ""If this had happened in Surrey instead of Yorkshire and the East Midlands, I think it would have been a very different story."" Jeremy Corbyn met flood victims in South Yorkshire on Saturday Number 10 disputed this, saying the decision to hold a Cobra meeting about the response to flooding had been taken prior to the letter from Mr Corbyn. The flooding situation at the weekend had not reached the level where a national emergency could be officially declared. Chancellor Sajid Javid said the government was ""very concerned"" about the flooding in northern England and ""the impact it's having on the people there"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson visited flood-hit Matlock on Friday Meanwhile, Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson arrived in Stainforth where sheset out plans for a Â£5bn fund to improve flood defencesacross the UK. She said: ""It is wrong that it seems to be just down to the local communities, important though this work is; this is clearly a national emergency and the government should be declaring it as such."" Jo Swinson has called for ""long-term policy changes"" over flooding National Farmers Union (NFU) president Minette Batters said ""seismic change"" was needed to tackle flooding. She said the current situation was an ""absolute disaster"" for farmers and called for a ""reform on how we manage water"", adding that it was a ""wake-up call"" for all politicians. By Dominic Casciani, BBC Home Affairs Correspondent The key legislation that deals with this kind of event does not refer to a ""national emergency"" as such, but only an ""emergency"" - which is an event that threatens ""serious damage to human welfare"", the environment, or is a major attack, such as war or a huge act of terrorism. TheCivil Contingencies Act 2004,externalforces public bodies to prepare for such worst-case scenarios. In the case of the current floods, the Environment Agency, local councils and others are expected to have planned properly and to swing into action. If an emergency is somehow overwhelming, ministers can use the Act to take control and even override existing laws and rules. One of the catalysts for the legislation was a national fuel shortage in 2000 as protesters blockaded refineries over petrol pump prices. Were that to happen today, a prime minister could in theory order the Army to commandeer fuel tankers and keep the nation moving. The Cobra meeting is Whitehall's way of trying to efficiently bring together all the key people in an emergency to co-ordinate the government's response. Four Environment Agency pumps are in Fishlake to remove floodwater from the village. Joe Howslam, 23, told the BBC: ""I live with my parents, brother and sister, but we've all had to move out. ""In the history of Fishlake it's never been this bad, according to some of the older members of our village."" Pam Webb, who owns a spa in Fishlake, described how she lost everything she has worked for after her insurance did not cover flooding. ""I feel really selfish in saying this and I hope that other people aren't in this boat, but I've lost my home and my business and my livelihood that I've worked so hard for."" Many parts of Fishlake remain under 3ft (1m) of water Tractors and boats have been used to get around the village, with many roadsin the area under floodwater. According to the Salvation Army, some people have been rescued from their homes by boat since the early hours of Saturday, but others remain in their properties, while military helicoptershave been used,externalto help boost flood defences in the area. Inside the primary school class with 63 pupils Medieval wall collapses on house and garden Paraplegic amputee gains diving qualification Carol Foster, who lives near the River Don in the village of Kirk Bramwith in South Yorkshire, said she had been completely cut off for five days. ""It's just a huge lake all around me,"" she said. ""I have enough food but it's just, I don't have any power so I only have a log burning stove, which has a flat top so I've been heating you know, pans of milk for hot drinks and water to wash in."" The Environment Agency called in an RAF Chinook late on Sunday In Worksop, hundreds of homes have been evacuated and dozens of businesses have also been badly hit. Susan Hale said the floodwater had ""completely devastated"" her tapas bar. ""The years of hard work and love [have] just gone in a day,"" she said. Flood warnings remain in Lincolnshire where more than 1,000 acres have been flooded and some train lines blocked. Further south, parts of Derbyshire are also still affected by flooding. Areas around Matlock - where former High Sherriff of DerbyshireAnnie Hall was swept to her deathby the flooded River Derwent - are continuing their clean-up efforts, with further rain over the weekend.

"Plastic in the Pacific Ocean off California Plastic is building up in the areas of the ocean where fish feed and grow, according to research. A study found bits of plastic outnumber baby fish by seven to one in nursery waters off Hawaii. It appears that the same ocean processes that concentrate prey for juvenile fish also accumulate floating plastics. There is growing evidence that plastic is being ingested by marine life, but the health implications are unclear. ""We don't have the data to say whether or not this has a negative effect on fish populations,"" Dr Gareth Williams of Bangor University, UK, told BBC News. ""But the fact that they're eating these non-nutritious particles at the point when eating is so critical for their survival in those first few days, it can only be a bad thing."" Seeking the 'plastic score' of the food on our plates Plastic in Pacific 'growing rapidly' Can you spot ocean plastic from space? The researchers set out to investigate the roles of ""slicks"" as nursery habitats for tiny larval fish. Slicks are naturally occurring, ribbon-like, smooth water features of the oceans, which are full of plankton, an important food resource. When the researchers started surveys for plankton off the coast of Hawaii, they were surprised to find lots of plastic in the nets. ""It was completely unexpected,"" said Dr Williams. ""The fact that the plastics outnumber the larval fish was astonishing."" Larval flying fish (top) and triggerfish (bottom) with ingested plastics zoomed in. Dime shown for scale. Plastic densities in surface slicks off Hawaii were, on average, eight times higher than the plastic densities recently found in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.  Inside the slicks there were seven times more plastics than there were larval fish. ""We were shocked to find that so many of our samples were dominated by plastics,"" said Dr Jonathan Whitney, a marine ecologist for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). After dissecting hundreds of larval fish, the researchers discovered that many fish species ingested plastic particles. ""We found tiny plastic pieces in the stomachs of commercially targeted pelagic (open sea) species, including swordfish and mahi-mahi, as well as in coral reef species like triggerfish,"" said Dr Whitney. Plastics were also found in flying fish, which are eaten by top predators such as tunas and most Hawaiian seabirds. ""Biodiversity and fisheries production are currently threatened by a variety of human-induced stressors such as climate change, habitat loss, and overfishing,"" said Dr Jamison Gove, of the Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center in Honolulu.

"Neil McEvoy said he used a mobile phone to make the recordings Police have launched an inquiry after a politician made secret recordings of the man who was in charge of overseeing three complaints about him. Welsh Assembly Member Neil McEvoy claimed his recordings ofstandards commissioner,externalSir Roderick Evans revealed sexism and bias. Sir Roderick,who resigned on Monday, said much of what had been shared was out of context and misleading. Independent AM Mr McEvoy said he had acted lawfully. South Wales Police said it had ""commenced an investigation following a referral from the National Assembly for Wales concerning allegations of covert recordings"". Mr McEvoy's actions prompted a security sweep of the assembly estate. Neil McEvoy expelled from Plaid Cymru for 18 months Who is Neil McEvoy? Neil McEvoy faces ""bullying"" probe Opening assembly business on Tuesday, presiding officer Elin Jones said police had been asked to look into how the recordings were made and investigate their legality. ""The covert recording of private conversations on the assembly estate is a serious breach of trust,"" she said. She alleged the recordings included confidential evidence by a witness during an investigation into Mr McEvoy's conduct. Assembly authorities have begun the process of finding an acting commissioner and Ms Jones told the assembly no complaints would be dropped as a result of Sir Roderick's resignation. Mr McEvoy recorded hearings held by the commissioner as he conducted his investigation into the former Plaid Cymru AM, using a mobile phone he said was either in his jacket, bag or on a table. They recorded conversations held while the South Wales Central AM was out of the room and others on the recordings were unaware he had made them. Sir Roderick Evans had been standards commissioner since 2017 Mr McEvoy defended his secret recordings of Sir Roderick and his staff in a press conference on Tuesday. Accusing Sir Roderick of presiding over a ""locker room culture"", he claimed the commissioner aired ""really sexist views"" about ""female lawyers who - of course because they're female - they're emotional"". He added: ""There was a provocative and politically incorrect culture in the commissioner's office that came across through the recordings."" Mr McEvoy alleged he heard a joke made about women politicians and a comment that former Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood should ""wind her neck in"". Sir Roderick, a former high court judge and pro-chancellor of Swansea University, previously said Mr McEvoy's conduct was ""wholly unacceptable"" and ""undermines the integrity of the complaints procedure"". The office of the standards commissioner had no further comment to make about Mr McEvoy's press conference. The controversy erupted in the assembly chamber on Tuesday, when Brexit Party Senedd leader Mark Reckless was told by Ms Jones to stop quoting from a transcript of the recordings. She also demanded he withdraw an accusation that she was biased, to which he replied: ""The truth or otherwise of the allegation, I withdraw it."" Elin Jones said no complaints would be dropped as a result of Sir Roderick's resignation He faces three investigations - one relating to Â£5,000 of building work on his constituency office. In a transcript of the recordings released to the media by Mr McEvoy's office, Sir Roderick is reported saying the authenticity of two quotes ""couldn't be demonstrated"". ""We have to consider if they are forgeries or whatever, [and] whether he should be reported to the police,"" he added. Mr McEvoy said he had taken the cheapest quote available: ""The quotes were nothing to do with me. I took them in good faith."" He said the builder was ""just somebody that I knew."" The second matter was about him losing his temper with Labour AM Mick Antoniw - he admitted being ""aggressive to him,"" but felt Mr Antoniw was arrogant. ""If the individual was really offended by my behaviour, and he was upset by it, then I apologise to Mick,"" he added. He also faced an allegation hemisused assembly funds for political campaigning. Dismissing this, Mr McEvoy said: ""Strange that, isn't it, a Plaid Cymru member using his office for the benefit of Plaid Cymru."" He was a Plaid Cymru member until 2018,when he was expelled.

"Mr Dobson was a popular and avuncular figure in Labour politics for five decades The veteran Labour politician Frank Dobson, who served as health secretary under Tony Blair, has died aged 79. A popular figure in the party, he left government to contest the first-ever London mayoral election in 2000, coming third to ex-colleague Ken Livingstone. Mr Blair said Mr Dobson had made an ""immense contribution"" to Labour's 1997 landslide election victory and was a politician of the ""highest calibre"". Current Mayor Sadiq Khan said he was a ""hero of the London Labour movement"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Mr Dobson had been passionate about reducing health inequalities as well as fine political company, remembering him as a ""great raconteur, a great purveyor of stories and a great source of gossip around the House of Commons"". Mr Dobson served as MP for Holborn and St Pancras in central London for nearly 40 years before standing down in 2015, when he was succeeded by the shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer. Tony Blair's legacy 20 years on Labour's Frank Dobson to quit as MP Sir Keir said he would be remembered for his ""straight talking, good humour and the passion he brought to every job he had"", adding that ""he dedicated his life to serve the people of Camden and the Labour Party he loved"". In a statement, Mr Dobson's family said he died on Monday after a long period of illness. ""His family would like to thank all the staff at the Homerton University Hospital for their outstanding expertise, commitment and care in the last few months and also the staff of York Hospital for his previous excellent care,"" they said. ""He also greatly appreciated the support of his many friends and former parliamentary colleagues."" Mr Dobson led Labour-controlled Camden Council during the 1970s before first being elected to Parliament in 1979. He served in a number of shadow frontbench roles under Neil Kinnock, John Smith and Tony Blair during Labour's 18 years in opposition. As Labour's first health secretary for nearly 20 years, Mr Dobson oversaw the abolition of the internal market in the NHS, but was frustrated at financial constraints initially imposed by the Blair government, which stuck to the Conservatives' spending plans for the first two years. His mayoral bid in 2000 was widely viewed as a disaster at the time In 1999, he put himself forward as a candidate, many thought reluctantly, for the new post of London mayor. However, his campaign was a troubled one and he was pushed into third place behind Mr Livingstone, who ran as an independent after losing the Labour nomination to Mr Dobson - and the Conservative candidate Steve Norris. After his defeat, he never returned to government but continued in Parliament for a further 15 years. Mr Blair said his late colleague was a politician of the ""highest calibre"" whose ""often pugnacious style"" never disguised his loyalty to the party and his commitment to ""changing the lives of people for the better"". ""He made an immense contribution to getting Labour back into power in the 1990s,"" he said in a statement. ""Despite the tight spending limits for the first two years, Frank made many important improvements to the NHS, an institution he cared about deeply."" In his own tribute, former chancellor and prime minister Gordon Brown said Mr Dobson had been a ""highly successful and reforming"" health secretary who ""represented all that is good about Labour values"". ""He was always popular with colleagues, never forgetting where he came from or the people he came into politics to represent"". And current Conservative Health Secretary Matt Hancock also praised Mr Dobson's ""years of devotion"" to the health service. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

By the BBC's parliamentary correspondent Mark D'Arcy In another political era, Frank Dobson might have flown higher in a Labour government, but he entered Parliament just as his party began their long exile in the Thatcher-Major years, and by the time it returned to power, his face didn't quite fit any more. As a classic product of Labour local government, he was a traditionalist on policy, and as Tony Blair attempted to shift ""New Labour"" towards a different approach, Mr Dobson was something of a holdout - a left-pragmatist rather than a starry-eyed Blairite. His personal style was a holdout too - the Tory diarist Alan Clark found they shared a politically-incorrect sense of humour: ""His [stories] are so filthy that really they're unusable, even at a rugger club dinner,"" he wrote in his diaries. But Mr Dobson could quote Shakespeare with equal ease. After Labour's 1997 landslide, he scrapped the previous Conservative government's internal market in the health service - only for his successor Alan Milburn to re-introduce a version of it. By 2000 he was manoeuvred out of the Department of Health and into a thankless role as Labour's candidate for the newly-created London mayoralty. With the party machine behind him he won the nomination ahead of the left-winger, Ken Livingstone. But when Livingstone ran anyway, as an independent, Dobson came a humiliating third in what was supposed to be a Labour city. He never returned to government.

"Palestinian Islamic Jihad has vowed to avenge Baha Abu al-Ata's death An Israeli air strike has killed a senior commander of the militant group Palestinian Islamic Jihad in Gaza. Baha Abu al-Ata died along with his wife when a missile hit their home, the group said. Four of their children and a neighbour were reportedly injured. Israel's prime minister said Abu al-Ata was a ""ticking bomb"" who was planning to carry out attacks on the country. At least 150 rockets have been fired at Israel from Gaza since the killing, which PIJ has vowed to avenge. This video can not be played Watch a rocket launched from the Gaza Strip land in on a highway in Israel Seventeen Israelis have been lightly wounded in rocket attacks across the south, according to the Barzilai Medical Center in the city of Ashkelon. Medics said an eight-year-old girl was also in a serious condition after collapsing as her family rushed towards a bomb shelter when an air raid siren sounded in Holon, south of Tel Aviv. Around the same time as the attack on Abu al-Ata, two people were killed and 10 injured in an Israeli air strike on the home of another Palestinian Islamic Jihad leader in the Syrian capital, Damascus, Syria's state news agency Sana said. Syrian media said another Israeli air strike targeted the home of a PIJ leader in Damascus Sana cited a military source as saying the PIJ leader, Akram al-Ajouri, was not harmed, but that his son was among the dead. Israel's military did not comment. PIJ, which is backed by Iran, has its headquarters in Damascus and is one of the strongest militant groups in Gaza. An Israeli warplane fired a missile at a residential building in the eastern Shejaiya area of Gaza before dawn on Tuesday, causing an explosion that could be heard from kilometres away. The missile hit the third floor, killing Abu al-Ata and his wife. The Israeli military said it carried out a ""surgical strike"" on Baha Abu al-Ata's home A PIJ statement confirming Abu al-Ata's death said he was its commander in Gaza's northern region and that he was undertaking ""a heroic jihadist action"". Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Abu al-Ata an ""arch-terrorist"" and said he was ""the main instigator of terrorism from the Gaza Strip"". What is it like to live in the Gaza Strip? What are the Palestinian territories? ""He initiated, planned and carried out many terrorist attacks. He fired hundreds of rockets at communities in the area adjacent to the Gaza Strip, whose suffering we have seen,"" he told a news conference in Tel Aviv. ""He was in the midst of planning additional attacks in the immediate short term. He was a ticking bomb."" The Chief of Staff of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), Lt Gen Aviv Kochavi, said Abu al-Ata had undermined recent efforts to broker a ceasefire between Israel and the militant group Hamas, which runs Gaza and is considered a rival to PIJ. Mr Netanyahu warned there could be a protracted period of tension with militants in Gaza. ""Israel is not interested in escalation, but will do everything necessary to defend ourselves,"" he said. ""And I say in advance: This could take time. Patience and composure are required."" Baha Abu al-Ata came to prominence in Gaza this year, commanding fighters of Islamic Jihad's al-Quds Brigade in the north and east of the strip. But he acted increasingly outside of the control of the dominant militant faction Hamas, ordering rocket attacks seemingly without approval after Israeli soldiers shot and injured dozens of Palestinians during regular protests at the perimeter fence earlier this month. A Palestinian TV presenter even warned on-air recently that his actions might see the Israelis trying to kill him. A serious escalation in hostilities is now likely, despite Israel's efforts to signal to Hamas that it has not returned to a wider strategy of so-called targeted killings. At Abu al-Ata's funeral, senior PIJ official Khaled al-Batsh said Israel had ""executed two coordinated attacks - in Syria and in Gaza - in a declaration of war"". PIJ vowed that its retaliation would ""rock the Zionist entity"". Israel's prime minister said Baha Abu al-Ata was a ""ticking bomb"" Hamas said Israel bore ""full responsibility for the consequences of this escalation"". It warned that the killing of Abu al-Ata would ""not pass without punishment"". Following the air strike, rockets were fired from Gaza towards Israeli territory. Some were intercepted by Israel's Iron Dome air defence system, the IDF said. Air raid sirens sounded across parts of southern and central Israel, including Holon and Modiin, which are more than 50km (30 miles) from the border with Gaza. A factory in Sderot was hit, sparking a large blaze, along with two houses in Netivot and Eshkol Regional Council, Israeli media reported. In the wake of his killing, rockets were fired at Israel from Gaza After several hours, the IDF said it had begun retaliatory strikes on PIJ targets in Gaza, hitting a training compound and underground sites used for the manufacturing and storage of ammunition. Israeli aircraft also targeted PIJ rocket-launching units in two separate strikes, according to the IDF. Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry reported that three Palestinian men were killed in northern Gaza. The European Union called for an immediate end to the firing of rockets on civilian populations which it said was totally unacceptable, and said it supported Egyptian efforts to broker ""a rapid and complete de-escalation"".

"This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""A cyber attack against a political party in an election is suspicious"" Labour is reportedly suffering a second cyber-attack after saying it successfully thwarted one on Monday. The party says it has ""ongoing security processes in place"" so users ""may be experiencing some differences"", which it is dealing with ""quickly"". The Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack floods a computer server with traffic to try to take it offline. The BBC's Gordon Corera has been told Monday's attack was not linked to a state. Earlier, a Labour source said that attacks came from computers in Russia and Brazil. Our security correspondent said he had been told the first attack was a low-level incident - not a large-scale and sophisticated attack. A National Cyber Security Centre spokesman said the Labour Party followed the correct procedure and notified them swiftly of Monday's cyber-attack, adding: ""The attack was not successful and the incident is now closed."" Meanwhile, Labour has denied that there has been a data breach or a security flaw in its systems afterthe Times reported the party's website had exposed the names of online donors,external. Live: Latest election news Cyber-attacks on UK firms 'jump' in 2019 Following reports of a second cyber-attack, a Labour Party spokesperson said: ""We have ongoing security processes in place to protect our platforms, so users may be experiencing some differences. We are dealing with this quickly and efficiently."" DDoS attacks direct huge amounts of internet traffic at a target in an effort to overwhelm computer servers, causing their software to crash. They are often carried out via a network of hijacked computers and other internet-connected devices known as a botnet. The owners of which may be unaware their equipment is involved. DDoS attacks are not normally recognised as being a hack as they do not involve breaking into a target's systems to insert malware. They can vary in sophistication and size, and are sometimes used as a diversionary tactic to carry out a more damaging attack under the radar. Several companies provide services to repel DDoS attacks, but they can be costly. The BBC has confirmed that Labour is using software by the technology company Cloudflare to protect its systems. The US-based company boasts it has 15 times the network capacity of the biggest DDoS attack ever recorded, meaning it should be able to absorb any deluge of data directed at one of its clients. BBC political correspondent Jessica Parker said ""Labour Connects"", a tool for campaigners to design and print materials was disrupted on Monday and was ""closed for maintenance"" on Tuesday morning. A message on the site on Monday said it was experiencing issues ""due to the large volume of users"". This video can not be played EXPLAINED: What is a DDoS attack? Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Monday's cyber-attack was ""very serious"" and also ""suspicious"" because it took place during an election campaign. ""If this is a sign of things to come, I feel very nervous about it,"" he said. In a letter sent to Labour campaigners, Niall Sookoo, the party's executive director of elections and campaigns, said: ""Yesterday afternoon our security systems identified that, in a very short period of time, there were large-scale and sophisticated attacks on Labour Party platforms which had the intention of taking our systems entirely offline. ""Every single one of these attempts failed due to our robust security systems and the integrity of all our platforms and data was maintained."" Labour's general secretary Jennie Formby said on Twitter the attack was a ""real concern"" but she added she was proud of the party's staff who ""took immediate action to ensure our systems and data are all safe "". Emily Orton, from Darktrace, an AI company for cyber-security, told BBC Radio 4's The World at One: ""Really this is the tip of the iceberg in terms of the types of threats that, not just the Labour Party, but all political parties are going to be without a doubt experiencing on a daily basis."" ""I think anyone involved in politics and in government need to be preparing themselves for a lot more stealthy, sophisticated attacks than this,"" she added. By Leo Kelion, Technology desk editor The Times has revealed that Labour exposed the names of people who had donated money via an online tool. The details could be found via an RSS web feed generated by the site's code, which most browsers provide a way to inspect. In most cases the information was limited to the donors' first names and the sums given. But because some people had mistakenly added their surname to the first name input box, this too was disclosed. Labour denies this represented a security flaw or that a reportable data breach had occurred. It also believes that only a small number of full names were exposed. However, it made changes to shut down the RSS feed last night. ""The Labour Party takes its responsibilities for data protection extremely seriously,"" a spokesman said. ""If any concerns are raised, we assess them in line with our responsibilities under GDPR [General Data Protection Regulation ] and the Data Protection Act."" The Information Commissioner's Office told the BBC: ""We will not be commenting publicly on every issue raised during the general election. ""We will, however, be closely monitoring how personal data is being used during political campaigning and making sure that all parties and campaigns are aware of their responsibilities.""

Scores of fires are still burning in New South Wales amid temperatures of 35C (95F) and winds of 80km/h (50mph). A feared southerly wind change has now occurred but the ""catastrophic"" day feared has largely been avoided.

Share your experiences by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. About six million people live in New South Wales (NSW) state. The number of fires still afflicting NSW ranged from 100 to 300 in Australian media reports. Crews have been battling a front spanning 1,000km (620 miles) along the north coast of NSW, with several blazes ""exceeding 100,000 hectares alone"", officials have said. Flame retardant had to be dropped in Sydney's northern suburbs as some bushfires approached within 15km (nine miles) of the city centre. Bushfires scorched parts of South Turramurra, an affluent suburb north of Sydney Earlier, residential areas of Sydney were doused in pink fire retardant A firefighting plane dropped pink fire retardant in the area between Macquarie University and the Sydney Adventist Hospital in the South Turramurra suburb. Flames came within metres of engulfing the homes of Blake Haymen and Sean Murphy in the affluent suburb. The residents were forced to use pool water to tackle a blaze that had spread from dense bushland across the road from their homes. ""We actually ran out of water pressure, so we had to go to the pool. Sean put out a spot-fire with one of these buckets,"" Mr Haymen told the Sydney Morning Herald. Authorities said one firefighter had suffered a broken arm and suspected fractured ribs. Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said: ""We've really got a long way to go. You can guarantee we're not going to be able to get around all of these fires before the next wave of bad weather. ""Unfortunately there's no meaningful reprieve. There's no rainfall in this change and we're going to continue to have warm dry conditions dominating in the days and weeks ahead."" Commissioner Fitzsimmons said up to a dozen homes were believed to have been damaged or destroyed on Tuesday. This video can not be played Matt Taylor looks at the causes behind Australia's bushfires People in vulnerable NSW communities have been urged to stay away from bushland. More than 600 schools are closed across the state. Australia's conservative government has refused to be drawn on whether climate change could have contributed to the fires, in a response that has drawn criticism. Three people have died and more than 170 properties have been destroyed since the fire emergency intensified in NSW on Friday.  .the highest point on Australia's six-point fire danger scale .results from high temperatures, strong winds and dry ground .fires starting under these conditions will threaten lives .homes cannot be defended from catastrophic fires .the only survival advice is to leave at risk areas early Authorities had said they were facing what could be ""the most dangerous bushfire week this nation has ever seen"".

Police are investigating reports that a fire in North Rothbury, in the Hunter Region of NSW, and at least two others, may have been started deliberately. Locals try to put out ember-generated fires in New South Wales Fire authorities say a million hectares of land have burned in NSW since the fire season began in September. To the north, Queensland has also declared a state of emergency as 55 bushfires rage in the state. Though it was not facing such severe weather on Tuesday, officials warned conditions could deteriorate later in the week. Fire crews in South Australia were tacking about a dozen blazes, while bushfires in Western Australia also sparked emergency warnings. Scientists and experts warn that Australia's fire season has grown longer and more intense due to climate change. Officials have confirmed that 2018 and 2017 were Australia's third and fourth-hottest years on record respectively, and last yearthe nation experienced its warmest summer on record.

"A public inquiry is to be held into the circumstances surrounding the death of Sheku Bayoh in police custody. The 32-year-old never regained consciousness after being restrained by police in Kirkcaldy, Fife, in 2015. Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf said the questions to be examined by the inquiry would include whether race played a part in Mr Bayoh's death. On Monday, it was confirmed that no police officers would face prosecution over the case. Mr Bayoh's family said they felt ""betrayed"" by the decision not to prosecute the officers involved, who have always denied any wrongdoing. Mr Yousaf and First Minister Nicola Sturgeon met the family on Tuesday. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf met with the family of Sheku Bayoh Afterwards, Ms Sturgeon tweeted: ""I made clear the Scottish government's determination to get the answers to the questions they have about his death and its aftermath. I believe a full public inquiry is the best way to do that."" The justice secretary announced the inquiry in a statement to the Scottish Parliament. Mr Yousaf  said all deaths in police custody were subject to a mandatory fatal accident inquiry (FAI), but that the Lord Advocate believed this would not allow all the issues to be addressed in this case. FAIs can examine circumstances and factors leading up to a death, but not what follows later. Mr Yousaf said the Lord Advocate had identified questions about the early stages of the post-incident management of the investigation which could not be examined in a fatal accident inquiry. He said: ""That being the case, it is imperative that the circumstances leading up to Mr Bayoh's death and the events that followed, including whether race played a part, are examined in full and in public."" He told the parliament that the primary purpose of the public inquiry would be to investigate the circumstances of the case. Family 'betrayed' over decision not to prosecute officers Fresh questions over death in police custody But he said he had also instructed HM Inspectorate of Prisons to review deaths in prisons. Mr Yousaf said the process of appointing the inquiry's chairperson would begin shortly. Aamer Anwar, the family's lawyer, said: ""It follows that the inquiry must identify each and every individual and organisation who must bear responsibility and accountability for this tragedy and the mishandling of the aftermath. Debrah Cole, the director of Inquest, and lawyer Aamer Anwar joined the Bayoh family for the meeting at Holyrood ""We also believe that the inquiry must focus on whether institutional racism, discrimination, inequality and cultural attitudes were responsible for what occurred. To what extent did the life of Sheku Bayoh not count, or could have counted more? ""These concerns are inescapable as far as many of the core participants are concerned."" Mr Bayoh's family had initially been told in October 2018 that no criminal charges would be brought over his death. However, two months later evidence uncovered by BBC Scotland raised fresh questions about the way he had been treated by police officers before he died in their custody. The Disclosure investigationincluded evidence that the first officers on scene escalated the situation instead of trying to defuse it, and other evidence that Mr Bayoh's actions were exaggerated in official police documents. No prosecutions over Sheku Bayoh death Bayoh family 'devastated' over no charges 'Patience exhausted' on restraint death Restrained man's family to sue police Death in custody family 'keep fighting' Police Scotland Familyâs urgent call for local donor to help former Dundee teacher stave off leukaemia Every destination you can fly to from Edinburgh in 2025 Thursday court round-up â Nightmare neighbour and green baize disrespect Six of Scotland's largest primary schools in East Lothian, new figures reveal Edinburgh Crime: Man, 38, charged and remanded in custody following spate of city centre thefts Police searching for missing 71-year old Fife woman find body at loch LA mayor says winds and drought created 'perfect storm', while officials hit out at looters Biden praises Carter's character as former president's coffin heads to Georgia Henry Zeffman: Market trouble threatens Labour's economic plans The '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty.

"Sarah Barrass, 35, and Brandon Machin, 39, were half-siblings in a secret sexual relationship, police said The parents of six children murdered their two teenage sons the day after a bid to poison them failed. Sarah Barrass and Brandon Machin, who is her half-brother, strangled Tristan and Blake Barrass, aged 13 and 14, in Shiregreen, Sheffield, in May. The court heard how Barrass, 35, would regularly tell her children: ""I gave you life, I can take it away."" Barrass and Machin, 39, were both sentenced to a minimum of 35 years in prison at Sheffield Crown Court. They have both previously admitted murder, conspiracy to murder all six of their children, including Blake and Tristan, and five counts of attempted murder. The court heard how Barrass strangled Tristan with her dressing gown cord, before Machin strangled Blake with his hands. They then put plastic bags over the boys' heads, suffocating them. South Yorkshire Police said Barrass, of Gregg House Road, Shiregreen, and Machin, of Burngreave Road, had been in a secret sexual relationship for years. Blake (left) was strangled by Machin, and Tristan was strangled by Barrass Fearing they would be found out by the authorities and their children taken into care, they hatched a plot to kill them. Police said the plan was for Machin to discover what had happened and raise the alarm. On the evening of 23 May, Barrass tried to poison the four eldest children, by collecting tablets prescribed to one of the children for ADHD and forcing them to swallow them. Kama Melly QC, prosecuting, said: ""None of the children wanted to take the tablets but were forced to do so. ""The defendants expected the tablets to kill the children overnight."" Murder plot survivor 'fears becoming a killer' More stories from around Yorkshire When it became apparent the plan had failed, Barrass began to search online for other ways of killing her children, including suffocation, strangulation and drowning. She contacted Machin to tell him they were still alive and the pair then strangled the boys and placed bin bags over their heads ""to ensure their certain death"", Ms Melly said. The defendants then ran a bath and repeatedly tried to drown one of the younger children. When that too failed, Barrass took the surviving children - two of whom are under the age of 13, and two under three - to the bedroom and phoned the police. Bikers provided an escort for the funeral of Tristan and Blake in August The court heard Barrass had previously approached the local authority to ask for help with her children. Ms Melly said the mother sent a message to a friend which said: ""I've thought of every possible solution to this mess. ""I love my kids too much to kill them, I can't put them into care for the same reason."" Bryan Cox QC, mitigating for Barrass, said she was ""profoundly damaged by her childhood"". He said: ""The defendant was desperate to prevent her children being taken into care. ""She couldn't cope with the prospect of them being removed."" The court heard she told police she planned to kill the younger two children and herself, after the older four had died. Mr Justice Goss, sentencing, said to Barrass: ""You considered your love for them and fear of being parted from them entitled you to take their lives as well as your own."" Speaking after the sentencing, Edmund Hulbert from the Crown Prosecution Service said: ""This was an appalling crime in which two young lives were lost, and a family torn apart, leaving a community in shock. ""Two of the surviving children witnessed their older siblings being attacked and the trauma that all the children have experienced, and will continue to experience, is unimaginable. ""It is paramount now that the surviving children are allowed to rebuild their lives in peace."" Matthew Saunders, a friend of the murdered boys, said outside court: ""A piece of all our hearts died on 24 May 2019, which we will never get back. ""Blake and Tristan leave a huge empty void in our lives, and we did not get chance to say goodbye. ""We are relieved justice has been served, but it should never have come to this.""

"This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""Labourâs 'national education service' will offer people free education as a right for all."" Labour is promising a Â£3bn plan to offer adults in England free access to retraining to help their job chances and to tackle skills shortages. Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner wants to ""throw open the door"" to adults wanting to learn new skills. The Lib Dems are promising a Â£10,000 training grant for each adult, which it calls a ""skills wallet"". The Conservatives have a National Retraining Scheme for adults needing to update their skills for work. With concerns about automation threatening jobs and warnings from employers about a lack of skilled staff, the political parties are setting out their stalls for adult education and retraining. The CBI business group welcomed making training a priority, saying: ""Adult participation in education is at its lowest for two decades."" The Edge vocational education charity warned the current skills shortage was costing UK businesses Â£4.4bn per year. Live: Latest election news On Tuesday, Labour's election campaign set out plans to spend an extra Â£3bn per year to provide free access to vocational learning for adults - which it hopes will reach an extra 300,000 people per year. Angela Rayner and Jeremy Corbyn will promise more support for training for jobs Ms Rayner says it will help people ""who want to change career, are made redundant or didn't get the qualifications they needed when they were younger"". ""For many, adult education is too expensive, too time-consuming or too difficult to get into,"" she says. Labour would offer adults up to six years of training, such as for vocational qualifications in the healthcare and engineering sectors or adults wanting to go back to college to get academic qualifications. Employees would also have a right to paid time off for education and training and there are promises to improve careers advice for adults. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Ms Rayner said she wanted to ""change the culture"" so that ""learning is part of everyday life, rather than something that is done to you at a particular point"". It was a ""long overdue investment"", she said, improving the skills of young people and adults, rather relying on skilled workers from abroad. The shadow education secretary said access to adult education would be open to all and would be ""free at the point of use"" without means testing, with funding to come from changes to taxes for high earners and businesses. Ms Rayner also restated Labour's commitment to scrapping tuition fees for university students in England. ""We will abolish tuition fees, no ifs, no buts."" She rejected concerns from vice chancellors about whether university funding would be protected, accusing them of receiving ""wild amounts"" of pay, and saying they were paid much more than the prime minister. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn says education should be ""like an escalator running alongside you throughout life, that you can get on and off whenever you want"". The Liberal Democrats have put forward their plans for adult education - based on the idea of individuals having a ""skills wallet"" to pay for training, with government funding being available to be drawn down at different stages of life. At the age of 25, there would be Â£4,000 put into the skills wallet, Â£3,000 at the age of 40 and then Â£3,000 at the age of 55. The Lib Dems say the policy will cost Â£1.6bn per year by 2024-25. Lib Dems propose Â£10,000 'skills wallet' Labour warns of 'catastrophic' fall in adult learners National Retraining Scheme for workers who lose jobs to automation 'I left school with no exams, but that didn't mean I was thick' ""In an ever changing workplace, people often need to develop new skills but the cost of courses and qualifications shuts too many people out,"" Lib Dem business spokesman Sam Gyimah says. Sam Gyimah, of the Lib Dems, has promised adults individual funding for their learning needs The Conservatives in government have begun to test plans for a National Retraining Scheme, supported by Â£100m announced in last year's Budget. This is intended to help people train for changing jobs and alternative careers if their jobs are threatened by automation. There are some local pilot tests for the retraining scheme, available to adults without degrees in low-income jobs. It is scheduled to be rolled out more widely in 2020. The Conservatives also highlighted their plans for new vocational qualifications, called T-levels. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said Labour was ""making promises that it simply won't be able to fulfil"". But Jo Grady, leader of the UCU lecturers' union, warned of ""steep falls"" in numbers of adult students. ""For too many years, adult learning has been a sorely neglected part of our education system,"" she said. Gavin Williamson says Labour is making promises they ""won't be able to fulfil"" Neil Bates, who chairs the Edge vocational educational charity, said employers would want to tackle the Â£4.4bn cost of skills shortages - and individuals needed to have the skills for ""secure, well paid, sustainable jobs"". The chief executive of the Learning and Work Institute, Stephen Evans, who was a member of Labour's Lifelong Learning Commission, warned that currently ""the number of adults taking part in learning at its lowest levels on record"". ""Worse still, it is the adults who could most benefit from access to training opportunities who are least likely to participate,"" he said. Employers have complained of skills shortages and Matthew Fell, the CBI's chief policy director, said it was important ""lifelong learning is rising to the top of the political agenda"". He said businesses would also welcome support for technical education and giving it a status ""on par with academic learning"". All the parties know their record on adult education is pretty poor, writes Sophie Hutchinson. According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, in the past 15 years, overall spending on classroom-based courses has fallen by two-thirds, as have the number of adult learners. The adult education budget fell by 32% between 2003-04 and 2009-10 under Labour and by a further 47% from 2009-10 to 2018-19 under the coalition and the Conservatives. Labour now says it would reverse that and more, coming close to doubling the current adult education budget, taking it back to levels similar to 2003. The Lib Dems also want a boost to lifelong learning - with a ""skills wallet"" for money for adults to spend on learning. But there will be a challenge ensuring this is spent on genuine courses - as a previous Individual Learning Account scheme faced widespread fraud. Lib Dems propose Â£10k 'skills wallet' Fall in adult learners 'catastrophic' says Labour UK workers who lose jobs to AI will be retrained 'No exams but I knew I wasn't thick' Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser LA mayor says winds and drought created 'perfect storm', while officials hit out at looters Biden praises Carter's character as former president's coffin heads to Georgia Henry Zeffman: Market trouble threatens Labour's economic plans The '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty.

"This video can not be played Ewan Fisher: 'Everything just got worse and worse... I nearly lost my life' A teenage boy nearly died after vaping caused a catastrophic reaction in his lungs, doctors in Nottingham say. Ewan Fisher was connected to an artificial lung to keep him alive after his own lungs failed and he could not breathe. Ewan told BBC News e-cigarettes had ""basically ruined me"" and urged other young people not to vape. His doctors say vaping is ""not safe"", although health bodies in the UK say it is 95% safer than tobacco. Listen: Beyond Today - Can vaping kill you? Vaping: How popular are e-cigarettes? Ewan started vaping in early 2017. He was 16 at the time and wanted to quit smoking to improve his boxing. Despite being under age, he said, ""it was easy"" to buy either cigarettes or e-cigarettes. In May that year, Ewan was finding it harder and harder to breathe. His mother took Ewan to accident and emergency on the night before his GCSE exams, because he was coughing and choking in his sleep. His lungs were failing and he very quickly ended up on life-support in intensive care in Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham. ""I thought I was going to die,"" Ewan told BBC News. Ewan was getting worse. Even ventilation could not get enough oxygen into his body and his life was in the balance. Ewan was attached to an ECMO machine to keep him alive He was taken to Leicester and attached to an artificial lung or ECMO (extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation) machine. ""This machine saved my life,"" he said. Large tubes took blood out of Ewan, removed the carbon dioxide, added oxygen and pumped the blood back into his body. ""He had very serious respiratory failure, he had to go to ECMO and that is a very big deal,"" Dr Jayesh Bhatt, a consultant at Nottingham University Hospitals, told BBC News. ""He got as ill as anyone can get."" The case - from May 2017 - has just come to lightin the journal Archives of Disease in Childhood,external. Ewan, who is 19 on Tuesday, had a long recovery. It was six months before he was properly up and on his feet again. ""I'm still not back to normal, I'd say 75-80%, it's in the last six months that I'm feeling a bit stronger in myself,"" he said. ""Vaping has basically ruined me, I try to tell everyone and they think I'm being stupid, I tell my mates and they don't listen. ""They still do it... but they've seen what I've been through. ""Is it worth risking your life for smoking e-cigs? ""I don't want you to end up like me and I don't want you to be dead, I wouldn't wish [that] on anyone."" Ewan also fears being around other vapers - everywhere from the pub to High Street - could damage his lungs again. His doctors say the answer is yes. Ewan developed a condition called hypersensitivity pneumonitis - something he was breathing in was setting off his immune system, with catastrophic consequences. ""You get an over-exuberant inflammatory response and the lungs pay a price and develop respiratory failure,"" Dr Bhatt said. One of the most common forms of hypersensitivity pneumonitis is ""bird fancier's lung"", which is caused by particles from feathers or bird droppings. When scientists tested the two e-cigarette liquids Ewan had been using, they found one of them was triggering an immune reaction. Dr Bhatt said: ""The real learning point is vaping is not safe, especially for young people, they should never go near it. ""We consider e-cigarettes as 'much safer than tobacco' at our peril."" There are 3.6 million people vaping in the UK and reactions like this are rare. 'Half as many Britons' vape as smoke However, doctors have told BBC News Ewan's case is not an isolated incident. ""As vaping becomes more popular, we are beginning to see more cases,"" Dr Hemant Kulkarni, a consultant in paediatric respiratory medicine at Sheffield Children's NHS Foundation Trust, said. He told BBC News: ""Some of the cases my colleagues and I have seen are teenagers presenting with severe lung injury and some of these have been life-threatening. ""However, in the cases I've been involved in, patients are now regaining normal lung function."" Dr Kulkarni is ""surprised"" e-cigarettes are advertised in the UK, given the severe reaction they can cause in children and a lack of scientific studies on their safety. Smoking is pretty much the worst thing you can do for your health. E-cigarettes are promoted in the UK as a way to quit because they let people inhale nicotine in vapour rather than breathing in smoke. Ewan's reaction was extreme, but what about the rest of us who would not end up with hypersensitivity pneumonitis? India e-cigarettes: Ban announced to prevent youth 'epidemic' Public Health England says vaping is 95% safer than smoking but is not without risks. Rosanna O' Connor, the body's director of drugs, alcohol and tobacco, said: ""Smoking kills half of lifelong smokers and accounts for almost 220 deaths in England every day. ""Our advice remains that while not completely risk free, UK regulated e-cigarettes carry a fraction of the risk of smoked tobacco."" But there are arguments about how safe vaping really is. The World Health Organization says,externale-cigarettes are ""undoubtedly harmful and should therefore be subject to regulation"". It also raises concerns vaping is being aggressively marketed at young people - particularly through the use of flavourings - and risked re-normalising smoking. The deaths of 39 people in the US have been connected to vaping and have prompted worldwide concern about its safety. There have been 2,051 cases of e-cigarette, or vaping, product use associated lung injury (called EVALI)in the outbreak,external. Most of those cases, but not all, have been linked to vaping THC, the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis. Ewan was using standard e-cigarettes bought from a shop. Dr Nick Hopkinson, medical director of the British Lung Foundation, said: ""If people switch completely from smoking to vaping, they will substantially reduce their health risk as e-cigarettes do not contain tobacco and any harmful components are present at a much lower level. ""People who do switch should try to quit vaping in the long term too but not at the expense of relapsing to smoking - and non-smokers should not take up vaping."" Prof John Britton, the director of the UK Centre for Tobacco and Alcohol Studies, at the University of Nottingham, said: ""This is worrying, and the risk needs to be acknowledged, but in absolute terms it is extremely small and, crucially, far smaller than that of smoking. ""The advice remains the same: if you smoke, switch to vaping; if you don't smoke, don't vape."" Follow Jameson Twitter,external.

"This video can not be played Hillary Clinton called on the UK to publish an intelligence report on Russian covert actions It is ""inexplicable and shameful"" that the UK government has not yet published a report on alleged Russian interference in British politics, Hillary Clinton has told the BBC. The report has formal security clearance, but it will not be released until after the 12 December election. ""Every person who votes in this country deserves to see that report before your election happens,"" the former US presidential candidate said. No 10denies it is suppressing it. No 10 'sitting on' Russian interference report Facebook: Russian Brexit meddling 'minimal' Clinton 'wants to hug Meghan over racism' The report by Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee examines Russian activity in UK democracy. It includes allegations of espionage, subversion and interference in elections. It contains evidence from UK intelligence services such as GCHQ, MI5 and MI6 concerning covert Russian attempts to influence the outcome of the 2016 EU referendum and 2017 general election. The report was finalised in March and referred to No 10 on 17 October. But approval for its publication has yet to be given - and is not due to happen until after polling day. MPs on the intelligence committee have been highly critical of that outcome, but the government has said the timing is not unusual. President Vladimir Putin has denied accusations of Russian interference Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme while in the UK on a book tour, Mrs Clinton said she was ""dumbfounded"" that the government would not release the report. ""That should be an absolute condition,"" she said. ""Because there is no doubt - we know it in our country, we have seen it in Europe, we have seen it here - that Russia in particular is determined to try to shape the politics of western democracies. ""Not to our benefit, but to theirs."" She also told BBC Radio 5 Live's Emma Barnett: ""I find it inexplicable that your government will not release a government report about Russian influence.  Inexplicable and shameful."" The mystery of the Russia report No 10 denies suppressing Russia interference report But Chief Secretary to the Treasury Rishi Sunak said the report had to be ""properly processed"" before being made public. ""The standard process for reports like this is that they have to go through an appropriate period of vetting, due to the sensitive nature of the information they contain,"" he said. He said the report was received at the end of October and the vetting process could take several weeks. ""It's right that [reports like this are] properly processed to ensure our security and I think those processes are being followed,"" he added. Mrs Clinton said the US had a similar problem in the 2016 election, when she was defeated as the Democrat's candidate for president by Republican Donald Trump. Mr Trump and his campaign, she said, were under investigation for their connections with Russia, Russian agents, and others promoting Russian interests. But the American public did not know before the election. The Mueller Inquiry laid out a broad pattern of Russian interference in the US 2016 presidential election The Russians were still ""in"" her country's electoral system and ""pumping out propaganda"", Mrs Clinton said. ""So there's no doubt of the role that Russia played in our 2016 election and is continuing to play. ""I would hate to see that happen here. Whatever the outcome. I don't know what's in it, (the report) any more than anybody else does. ""But certainly, people who are about to vote in a month or so deserve to know what is in a report that one has to speculate, must have something of concern, otherwise why wouldn't it be publicly disclosed?"" Chancellor Sajid Javid has told the BBC the timescale for the publication of the report was ""perfectly normal"" because of the sensitive nature of the content. However, Labour's shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry has said the decision not to clear the report for publication before Parliament closed ahead of the general election was ""clearly politically motivated"". Speaking in the Commons last week, she suggested the report could lead to questions about links between Russia, Brexit and the Tory leadership, which could derail the Conservative election campaign. Sources have told the BBC there was no objection from any other government agency or department to the report's publication - leaving the decision to release it with Downing Street. In the US, the Mueller Inquiry laid out a broad pattern of interference in the US 2016 presidential election - particularly using social media and leaking of documents. However it did not establish any criminal conspiracy between Moscow and the Trump campaign. So far no evidence of a cyber campaign on a similar scale has been produced in the UK and government ministers have said there is no evidence of ""successful"" Russian interference in UK elections. Mrs Clinton's comments came hours beforethe Labour Party reported a ""sophisticated and large-scale cyber-attack"" on its digital platforms. A Labour source told the BBC ""tens of millions of attacks - mostly originating from Russia and Brazil"" had been detected.

"Zia Uddin kept condoms in the control room where he sexually assaulted the girls A Primark security guard has been found guilty of sexually assaulting teenage girls he accused of shoplifting. Zia Uddin, 27, from east London, attacked four 15-year-old girls while working at the Kingston store in 2017. Uddin threatened the teenagers with calling the police and their parents if they did not perform sexual acts on him in the control room of the store. He was convicted of one count of rape and four counts of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity. Kingston Crown Court heard Uddin's colleagues had noticed his strange behaviour, which included making requests to delete CCTV, and not properly completing paperwork on shoplifting. He was also known to keep condoms in the control room, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said. Once detained, some victims offered to pay for the items they had stolen, suggested they could work in the store to make amends, or even never enter the shop again. Zia Uddin knew where the ""blind spots"" were on the Kingston branch's CCTV However, once alone in the back office, Uddin, from Manor Park in Newham, made clear he was only interested in sexual acts in exchange for letting them go. Prosecutors said one girl only did as he asked because ""there was no other choice"" and it was the only way out of the situation. Graham Partridge, from the CPS, said Uddin ""preyed on young girls in a vulnerable situation"". ""He abused his authority by telling them to perform sexual acts for him on the promise they would then be released without their parents or the police being informed about what they had done. ""Having worked in security, Uddin was also well aware of the CCTV camera 'blind spots' and took advantage of these in order to carry out his offending."" He added that Uddin claimed all the victims were liars and refused to take responsibility for his actions. Uddin will be sentenced next Tuesday. A spokeswoman for Primark said: ""This has been a horrendous ordeal for the victims and their families and we are truly sorry for what they have suffered. Our thoughts are very much with them. ""The nature of these offences is shocking and distressing. ""Zia Uddin abused the trust that was placed in him by his employer, Brooknight Security, and by us, by taking advantage of his victims, who were young and vulnerable.""

" Election battleground: Bishop Auckland   By Duncan Leatherdale   The warming smell of freshly made pies wafts into the cold, grey autumnal air as the cafe door opens. Inside, a gang of ladies swap the latest gossip over cups of tea, a couple share a diet-defying scone and a man who has popped in to give his walking stick a rest tuts at the newspaper as steam rises from his fresh mug of coffee. Sam Zair’s Cafe does not look like the centre of a political web, but debate and discourse are as freely available here as a fried sausage or fresh lasagne. While his wife Lesley works behind the counter, Sam - a Durham County councillor - can usually be found regaling customers with war stories from the debating chamber, explaining his views on a controversial issue or attempting to assist someone with some council-related problem.         The Zairs have been in Bishop Auckland for a long time. Sam, whose grandparents moved to northern England from Arpino in Italy when they were teenagers, is the third generation of his family to run a business on this site. Their cafe stands on Fore Bondgate, one of the two main shopping streets in the town which congregate at a 90-degree angle in the large flagstoned marketplace dominated by the chateau-style town hall.  Sam and Lesley are keenly attuned to the problems Bishop Auckland faces. These are similar to many other places that prospered around a single industry only to see that industry leave. Bishop Auckland’s fortunes were closely linked to those of the dozens of collieries and coal pits that once filled the area surrounding it. An old market town that had grown up around Auckland Castle, the home of Durham's famed Prince Bishops, its banks offered miners places to save their money and its shops and pubs places to spend it. But by 1990 the mines were gone and the town was faltering. Today, about 4.2% of the town’s residents are claiming unemployment benefits, a touch higher than England’s national average. Falling incomes, internet shopping and an out-of-town retail park have left the town centre suffering, with some 20% of units empty. The streets are dominated by pound shops and charity stores. Units that once housed big names now just feature whitewashed windows and wooden boards. Manufacturing has dwindled with supermarkets becoming the biggest employers - this town of just 25,000 people has Aldi, Asda, Lidl, Morrisons, Sainsbury's and Tesco. The Zairs have watched with worry and woe as their once fine town has crumbled. It was here they co-founded a campaign to fight cuts at their town's hospital, here where they masterminded a new independent political movement after becoming disillusioned with the local Liberal Democrat party, and here where Sam mounted an ill-fated bid to become the town's MP in 2010. “No never,” he laughs when asked if he would consider doing it again, having secured 1,964 votes, a 4.8% share. “I enjoyed the experience, I got the T-shirt but ultimately it was a bad decision.” Becoming an MP was always going to be a tough task for a Liberal Democrat-turned independent in a town like Bishop Auckland, even if his surname is part of the furniture around here.    This is a Labour town. It has been since 1918 apart from four years in the 1930s when it was seized by the Liberal Nationals, who later merged into the Conservative party. But that could change on 12 December. Labour losing this town deep in its industrial heartlands would once have been unthinkable but the once safe seat can no longer be guaranteed. The party saw its majority in the constituency, which also includes Spennymoor, Shildon and Teesdale, slashed from 3,502 to 502 in 2017 as the Conservatives saw their vote share rocket from 32.5% to 46.9%. In the 2016 referendum, the area is reckoned to have voted 60.9% in favour of Brexit. Helen Goodman, the town’s MP since 2005, voted Remain, however, and has not deviated from that course since, to the consternation of many of her constituents. Conservative candidate Dehenna Davison meanwhile just wants to “get Brexit done”. As with the rest of the country, Brexit is a hot topic in Sam’s cafe. Both he and his wife want out of the EU. “The EU has become too big and dominant,” he says. “We have tried this for 40 years, let’s try 40 years out of it and see where we are. “This is a good strong country and it can stand up for itself. We can strike our own trade deals around the world and not be dictated to.” Their views are shared by their 29-year-old son Adam who, like his mother, has served as the town’s mayor in recent years. He is a keen pianist who works for a recycling firm on the outskirts of Durham city. Like his parents, he believes Britain can strike better trade deals outside of the EU than from within. “Nothing has changed my view but if anything has made it stronger,” he says over his lunch break. “We should get out and leave, people are getting very annoyed we haven’t.” The Zairs’ dissatisfaction with Labour is not entirely related to Brexit. Sam Zair was a Liberal Democrat when he was first elected to Wear Valley District Council in 2005. He became an independent four years later after it merged into the unitary authority of Durham County Council and he found himself unwillingly under a stronger party whip. The new independent group he formed with other disgruntled councillors vowed to put people before parties, Sam pledging to support whoever he felt had the best intentions for his town. “We have had more than 80 years of Labour rule in this area during which nothing has changed,” Sam says, adding: “We are still a deprived area, I think it is time for a change. “You never would have thought the Labour Party would lose here, I would never have believed it before, but things have drastically changed, that’s why I’m excited that now we have a got a chance for change. “New people means new ideas.” It is a view shared by Stephen Nicholson, a Bishop Auckland-based painter and decorator specialising in historic buildings. He has voted Labour all his adult life but now plans to switch. “We have had Labour in control here as long as I have been alive, but you see the town centre and you can see they do not do a lot for the area,” he says over his hands-free kit as he drives between jobs. “It used to be Labour was very much for the working man and I was always Labour as a young lad. But the last few years they have gone away from their root values and I do not think they stand for the working man. “I do not think they try hard enough for us and Bishop Auckland is a prime example to me of Labour doing nothing.” He says Brexit was a rebellion against the system, people in this hard-hit part of the world wanted a change and leaving the EU represented such a move. Like Sam and Stephen, Rob Yorke also wants a change but in the opposite direction - he wants a Labour government. He is a Labour county councillor for neighbouring West Auckland and runs an international engineering firm from the South Church Enterprise Park on the southern border of Bishop Auckland. While acknowledging Brexit will be the “number one issue” for many, which could cause conflict for leave-supporting Labour voters, he says there should be one question in the minds of those entering the election booth. “Am I better off now than I was 10 years ago?” he says from the head of the large table in his wood-panelled meeting room. “If the answer is no, vote for change, and for a lot of people it will be no. “How can we live in the 21st Century and have so many food banks in this area? When I became a councillor there were no food banks, but then something changed - we had Tory austerity and those Draconian cuts.” A Labour government, he says, would make the environment a priority and work for a “fairer society” where people are given a “helping hand, not hand outs”. “I think this election is going to be tough, nobody is taking it for granted,” he says. “But if you look at the 2017 election, though [Ms Goodman’s] majority was cut, the number of votes she got actually stayed around the same, it was other parties that were having an impact on each other. “It’s time for a change after nine years of Tory rule in which people have become a lot worse off in real terms.” However, for many people the cry of “change” could mean something other than Labour. Nigel Farage's announcement that the Brexit Party will not stand in seats where Conservatives won in 2017, means the party's Nick Brown is still very much in the Bishop Auckland race, as is Liberal Democrat Ray Georgeson. Turning right upon leaving Sam’s cafe takes you into the west side of the marketplace, past a toy shop where Thunderbirds characters jostle for position in the window with figures from the Walking Dead TV series. Heading south of the marketplace is the dead straight Newgate Street, the town’s main drag. About half way along is a statue of Stan Laurel, who lived in the town as a boy. He gazes out over a shopping centre, clothing stores, discount shops and bakeries, as well as an unhealthy number of boarded up and shuttered shops.  A quick detour to the left leads to King James I Academy, one of the town’s three large secondary schools, and drama teachers Joanne Howard and Todd Murgatroyd. Both grew up in and around the town and attended the school’s Bishop Auckland Theatre Hooligans youth group, which they now run as the rebranded RTS. They have seen the effect of poverty on the town’s children. Some 60% of the school’s pupils live in the top 20% of the country’s most deprived wards. But they also see the potential for vast improvement. “There is discord between what the town was, what it is trying to be now and what it will be in the future,” Joanne says, perched on a chair in one of the school’s large drama halls. “It’s either frustrating or exciting, depending which side of the schism you sit,” she says, adding: “I’m very much excited about the possibility.” She wants a Bishop Auckland bustling with quirky pop-up bars, restaurants and markets, regular repeats of the annual food festival that attracts tens of thousands of visitors to the marketplace. There is a lack of middle ground, she says, between the pound shops and poverty and high brow culture clubs such as the Spanish Art Gallery, which is being built in the town centre. When she was young there was Marks & Spencer and Woolworths in the town, places everyone went, but not any more. “There needs to be more things that are more accessible,” she says, adding it's also about “raising aspirations of people who were born and bred here”.    Battlegrounds Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire Cheltenham Enniskillen Norwich Pembrokeshire Southampton Todd was born and bred in Bishop Auckland and he says he hated it as a youngster. “It felt small-minded,” he recalls, reclining on a beaten up old sofa in the drama room, “the way people were talking about immigration and the attitude towards other people”. “But I wanted to come back after university to make it better because, as much as I whinge about it, you do have a lot of good people here who are willing to give something a go if they just get a little push. “The sense of community is huge.” Both have voted Labour in the past but also for other parties, notably the Liberal Democrats amid their (ultimately unfulfilled) promise to ditch university tuition fees. “I vote for a person rather than a political party,” Joanne says. “If I like the way someone articulates their view or is prepared to listen to an issue, that's what impress me.” Todd despises tribalism and will vote for someone he thinks will do the best job for his town. But he also votes tactically. “I’m engaged with politics because it annoys me so much,” he says. Both Joanne and Todd voted to remain in the EU but neither is surprised the majority of their fellow townsfolk wanted out. “They are very proud stoical people, proud of their history and heritage but sometimes that pride is rooted in negativity,” Joanne says. “Some want to perpetuate that downtrodden ‘grim up north’ vision. “We are a reactive town. If we are fed information that hits the key buzzwords we are concerned with, things like child benefit, immigration, the NHS, we are getting turned to thinking a certain way. “There is no patience and very little independent thinking at times.” Todd agrees and calls it the “politics of emotion”. “There is a lack of willingness to engage in any type of discourse,” he says. “There are a lot of people on both sides, Leave and Remain, who refuse to have a normal discussion about things but would rather have a list of 10 problems the EU causes or 10 things that will go wrong if we leave.” Social media and fake news are also worryingly big influences on people, the drama teachers say. That is a sentiment echoed in The Man Cave, a barber shop featuring beards, brick walls and Blink 182 where owner Sam Barrons is giving Paul, 31, a short back and sides. Normally politics is banned from Sam's shop, along with religion and football. This is a town divided by Newcastle United, Sunderland and a healthy smattering of Northern League sides. But Sam has temporarily relaxed the rules. “If it says it on Facebook it must be true,” she says over the buzz of her clippers. “That’s what people think and they only read what they agree with.” Paul, who asked not to use his surname, would nod in agreement except he is under strict instruction not to move his head as Sam straightens the hairline along his neck. He says people, including himself, should be better educated before making such big decisions on issues such as Brexit, and are “very easily influenced” by what they see, especially on social media. “It’s a ridiculously tricky subject to talk about,” he says. He voted Remain and was surprised his town opted to leave. “I was just naturally thinking the country was in quite a good place and the EU being a collective was generally a good idea so a lot would want to remain.” He has asked his Leave-supporting friends why they wanted out and says immigration is the most common answer. This surprises Sam, who grew up in Boston, Lincolnshire, which, unlike Bishop Auckland, has actually seen a big influx of EU workers predominantly to work on the county’s fenland farms. “You don’t see that much immigration in Bishop Auckland so I’m not sure why they would feel that way,” she says. Her award-winning shop stands as part of a row of businesses on Cockton Hill Road, the busy main road that connects the southern end of Newgate Street to the town's bypass. Sam’s political concerns are closer to home than Brussels. She wants an increase in the number of police officers to tackle crime and anti-social behaviour, much of which is drug related she says, and improved business rates to help shops compete in the modern internet age. “We are all guilty of it,” she says, as her scissors are a blurring whir atop Paul's thick black hair. “I do a lot of my shopping online, it’s cheaper for businesses to sell on there and that makes it cheaper for customers. “So they need to look at rates to help those businesses struggling in the shops.”   Back up on the southern half of Newgate Street, Bernie Rush, the owner of the Image bridal shop, agrees. She has sold wedding wear here for eight years but in December will close and instead focus on clothing alterations, which she will do at her home on the edge of the town. She cites competing with the internet as one of the big reasons for shutting up shop. She wants more realistic rates and landlords forced to make their empty premises more presentable rather than allowing them to go to “rack and ruin”. But shoppers also need to support the small businesses, the professionals with years of expertise and advice to share, the boutiques selling the individual and unique, Bernie says. “Use us or lose us,” she says with a solemn nod. Despite her own departure, Bernie is optimistic for the town's prospects thanks in large part to events like the food festival and another - the Auckland Project. Financier Jonathan Ruffer and his wife Jane bought Auckland Castle from the Church of England in 2012. The Auckland Project is their ambitious plan to make Bishop Auckland a top tourist destination attracting up to one million visitors a year. They turned a golf course on the north bank of the River Wear into a spectacular outdoor arena that each summer hosts the epic historical drama Kynren. The castle has been overhauled, a gallery of mining art has opened in the marketplace next to a newly-built viewing tower, a world-leading Spanish art gallery is under construction and plans are afoot for a faith museum and historic walled garden.   Supporters say the influx of visitors will spark a bonanza of boutique shops and bars. The former Marks & Spencer’s store recently reopened as a bar while plans have also been approved to turn the Beale’s department store into a hotel. But sceptics say they have yet to feel the benefit of the 250,000 visitors who attended the epic Kynren plays over the summer. Supporters say within three or four years, when all aspects of the project are open, business will be booming for all. Back in his cafe, Sam is also supportive of the Auckland Project but he says he is cautious. “As a businessman you have to be cautious,” he says as he reclines in the large leather desk chair in his small office at the back of the cafe. “I want to see it happen, I really do.” On his desk are pictures of his grandparents who ran a temperance bar on this site and then started making ice cream to be hawked in the town’s terraced streets and the neighbouring pit villages. He is all too aware of how much change is needed in Bishop Auckland, but also how much the town has to offer those who want to come here and work hard, just as his grandparents and parents did, as he and Lesley have done and his sons Mark and Adam are doing. “Bishop Auckland is a great place with great people,” he says. “We have to help them and make others realise it.” For a full list of Election 2019 candidates standing in Bishop Auckland see our constituency page: Bishop Auckland parliamentary constituency  Author: Duncan Leatherdale Online production: Paul Kerley Graphics: Irene de la Torre Arenas and Sean Wilmott Photography: Thomas Banks Auckland Castle image: Peter Haygarth (courtesy The Auckland Project) Photo Editor: Phil Coomes Editor: Dave Green ",Negative,0.034057114

"This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""Labourâs 'national education service' will offer people free education as a right for all."" Labour is promising a Â£3bn plan to offer adults in England free access to retraining to help their job chances and to tackle skills shortages. Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner wants to ""throw open the door"" to adults wanting to learn new skills. The Lib Dems are promising a Â£10,000 training grant for each adult, which it calls a ""skills wallet"". The Conservatives have a National Retraining Scheme for adults needing to update their skills for work. With concerns about automation threatening jobs and warnings from employers about a lack of skilled staff, the political parties are setting out their stalls for adult education and retraining. The CBI business group welcomed making training a priority, saying: ""Adult participation in education is at its lowest for two decades."" The Edge vocational education charity warned the current skills shortage was costing UK businesses Â£4.4bn per year. Live: Latest election news On Tuesday, Labour's election campaign set out plans to spend an extra Â£3bn per year to provide free access to vocational learning for adults - which it hopes will reach an extra 300,000 people per year. Angela Rayner and Jeremy Corbyn will promise more support for training for jobs Ms Rayner says it will help people ""who want to change career, are made redundant or didn't get the qualifications they needed when they were younger"". ""For many, adult education is too expensive, too time-consuming or too difficult to get into,"" she says. Labour would offer adults up to six years of training, such as for vocational qualifications in the healthcare and engineering sectors or adults wanting to go back to college to get academic qualifications. Employees would also have a right to paid time off for education and training and there are promises to improve careers advice for adults. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Ms Rayner said she wanted to ""change the culture"" so that ""learning is part of everyday life, rather than something that is done to you at a particular point"". It was a ""long overdue investment"", she said, improving the skills of young people and adults, rather relying on skilled workers from abroad. The shadow education secretary said access to adult education would be open to all and would be ""free at the point of use"" without means testing, with funding to come from changes to taxes for high earners and businesses. Ms Rayner also restated Labour's commitment to scrapping tuition fees for university students in England. ""We will abolish tuition fees, no ifs, no buts."" She rejected concerns from vice chancellors about whether university funding would be protected, accusing them of receiving ""wild amounts"" of pay, and saying they were paid much more than the prime minister. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn says education should be ""like an escalator running alongside you throughout life, that you can get on and off whenever you want"". The Liberal Democrats have put forward their plans for adult education - based on the idea of individuals having a ""skills wallet"" to pay for training, with government funding being available to be drawn down at different stages of life. At the age of 25, there would be Â£4,000 put into the skills wallet, Â£3,000 at the age of 40 and then Â£3,000 at the age of 55. The Lib Dems say the policy will cost Â£1.6bn per year by 2024-25. Lib Dems propose Â£10,000 'skills wallet' Labour warns of 'catastrophic' fall in adult learners National Retraining Scheme for workers who lose jobs to automation 'I left school with no exams, but that didn't mean I was thick' ""In an ever changing workplace, people often need to develop new skills but the cost of courses and qualifications shuts too many people out,"" Lib Dem business spokesman Sam Gyimah says. Sam Gyimah, of the Lib Dems, has promised adults individual funding for their learning needs The Conservatives in government have begun to test plans for a National Retraining Scheme, supported by Â£100m announced in last year's Budget. This is intended to help people train for changing jobs and alternative careers if their jobs are threatened by automation. There are some local pilot tests for the retraining scheme, available to adults without degrees in low-income jobs. It is scheduled to be rolled out more widely in 2020. The Conservatives also highlighted their plans for new vocational qualifications, called T-levels. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said Labour was ""making promises that it simply won't be able to fulfil"". But Jo Grady, leader of the UCU lecturers' union, warned of ""steep falls"" in numbers of adult students. ""For too many years, adult learning has been a sorely neglected part of our education system,"" she said. Gavin Williamson says Labour is making promises they ""won't be able to fulfil"" Neil Bates, who chairs the Edge vocational educational charity, said employers would want to tackle the Â£4.4bn cost of skills shortages - and individuals needed to have the skills for ""secure, well paid, sustainable jobs"". The chief executive of the Learning and Work Institute, Stephen Evans, who was a member of Labour's Lifelong Learning Commission, warned that currently ""the number of adults taking part in learning at its lowest levels on record"". ""Worse still, it is the adults who could most benefit from access to training opportunities who are least likely to participate,"" he said. Employers have complained of skills shortages and Matthew Fell, the CBI's chief policy director, said it was important ""lifelong learning is rising to the top of the political agenda"". He said businesses would also welcome support for technical education and giving it a status ""on par with academic learning"". All the parties know their record on adult education is pretty poor, writes Sophie Hutchinson. According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, in the past 15 years, overall spending on classroom-based courses has fallen by two-thirds, as have the number of adult learners. The adult education budget fell by 32% between 2003-04 and 2009-10 under Labour and by a further 47% from 2009-10 to 2018-19 under the coalition and the Conservatives. Labour now says it would reverse that and more, coming close to doubling the current adult education budget, taking it back to levels similar to 2003.

"Jo Swinson said the election might be people's last chance to stop Brexit The Welsh Liberal Democrats have launched their general election campaign with a promise to stop Brexit. Leader Jane Dodds and UK Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson promised they could ""build a brighter future for Wales"". The plans include stopping Brexit, investing in public services and tackling the climate crisis. Ms Swinson said: ""This is an opportunity for people to say they want to stop Brexit and it might be the last chance they have to do that."" Brexit Party will not contest eight Welsh seats Greens say Wales does not need an airport Tory party has 'failed' working people - Drakeford The party currently holds one seat in Wales having won Brecon and Radnorshire in a by-election in August 2019. Although Ms Swinson would not put a figure on how many Welsh MPs the party hoped send to Westminster next month, Ms Dodds was more forthcoming. ""We're really ambitious, of course, we're certainly saying we're going to be winning at least four, and we may be winning more,"" she told BBC Wales. The Liberal Democrats have entered into a ""Remain Alliance"" with Plaid Cymru and the Green Party and will not stand candidates in eight seats in Wales. Jane Dodds says she expects the Liberal Democrats to have four or more Welsh MPs elected Ms Swinson was also upbeat about her party's prospects in the winter election. ""Our targeting strategy is well informed by the data, which is showing that not only are we ahead of where we were last time in the polls by a significant amount, it's showing that there are many more people considering voting Liberal Democrat in these elections because of what we offer,"" she said. ""This is an opportunity for people to say they want to stop Brexit and it might be the last chance they have to do that,"" she said. ""That's why as Liberal Democrats we are being crystal clear - we are the party to stop Brexit and why are fighting a more ambitious campaign than we have ever done before in a general election, because of what's at stake."" Ms Swinson said she did not think anyone was surprised that the Liberal Democrats were still fighting Plaid Cymru in Ceredigion, a seat narrowly snatched by Plaid in 2017. ""Ceredigion is a very close seat and ourselves and Plaid Cymru are having a lively campaign there, it's one that we obviously held in the recent past,"" she said.

"Neil McEvoy said he used a mobile phone to make the recordings Police have launched an inquiry after a politician made secret recordings of the man who was in charge of overseeing three complaints about him. Welsh Assembly Member Neil McEvoy claimed his recordings ofstandards commissioner,externalSir Roderick Evans revealed sexism and bias. Sir Roderick,who resigned on Monday, said much of what had been shared was out of context and misleading. Independent AM Mr McEvoy said he had acted lawfully. South Wales Police said it had ""commenced an investigation following a referral from the National Assembly for Wales concerning allegations of covert recordings"". Mr McEvoy's actions prompted a security sweep of the assembly estate. Neil McEvoy expelled from Plaid Cymru for 18 months Who is Neil McEvoy? Neil McEvoy faces ""bullying"" probe Opening assembly business on Tuesday, presiding officer Elin Jones said police had been asked to look into how the recordings were made and investigate their legality. ""The covert recording of private conversations on the assembly estate is a serious breach of trust,"" she said. She alleged the recordings included confidential evidence by a witness during an investigation into Mr McEvoy's conduct. Assembly authorities have begun the process of finding an acting commissioner and Ms Jones told the assembly no complaints would be dropped as a result of Sir Roderick's resignation. Mr McEvoy recorded hearings held by the commissioner as he conducted his investigation into the former Plaid Cymru AM, using a mobile phone he said was either in his jacket, bag or on a table. They recorded conversations held while the South Wales Central AM was out of the room and others on the recordings were unaware he had made them. Sir Roderick Evans had been standards commissioner since 2017 Mr McEvoy defended his secret recordings of Sir Roderick and his staff in a press conference on Tuesday. Accusing Sir Roderick of presiding over a ""locker room culture"", he claimed the commissioner aired ""really sexist views"" about ""female lawyers who - of course because they're female - they're emotional"". He added: ""There was a provocative and politically incorrect culture in the commissioner's office that came across through the recordings."" Mr McEvoy alleged he heard a joke made about women politicians and a comment that former Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood should ""wind her neck in"". Sir Roderick, a former high court judge and pro-chancellor of Swansea University, previously said Mr McEvoy's conduct was ""wholly unacceptable"" and ""undermines the integrity of the complaints procedure"". The office of the standards commissioner had no further comment to make about Mr McEvoy's press conference. The controversy erupted in the assembly chamber on Tuesday, when Brexit Party Senedd leader Mark Reckless was told by Ms Jones to stop quoting from a transcript of the recordings. She also demanded he withdraw an accusation that she was biased, to which he replied: ""The truth or otherwise of the allegation, I withdraw it."" Elin Jones said no complaints would be dropped as a result of Sir Roderick's resignation He faces three investigations - one relating to Â£5,000 of building work on his constituency office. In a transcript of the recordings released to the media by Mr McEvoy's office, Sir Roderick is reported saying the authenticity of two quotes ""couldn't be demonstrated"". ""We have to consider if they are forgeries or whatever, [and] whether he should be reported to the police,"" he added. Mr McEvoy said he had taken the cheapest quote available: ""The quotes were nothing to do with me. I took them in good faith."" He said the builder was ""just somebody that I knew."" The second matter was about him losing his temper with Labour AM Mick Antoniw - he admitted being ""aggressive to him,"" but felt Mr Antoniw was arrogant. ""If the individual was really offended by my behaviour, and he was upset by it, then I apologise to Mick,"" he added. He also faced an allegation hemisused assembly funds for political campaigning. Dismissing this, Mr McEvoy said: ""Strange that, isn't it, a Plaid Cymru member using his office for the benefit of Plaid Cymru."" He was a Plaid Cymru member until 2018,when he was expelled.

"Sir Roderick Evans became standards commissioner in 2017 The man who oversees complaints about politicians in Wales has resigned after he was secretly recorded by an assembly member. Standards commissioner Sir Roderick Evans said ""highly confidential conversations"" with his staff had been taped. The former Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy has confirmed he made the recordings. Police are being asked to investigate and the assembly has arranged a sweep of the organisation's estate. The South Wales Central AM, who now sits as an independent, alleged he had found evidence that he claimed had brought Sir Roderick's office into disrepute. He said he had acted lawfully and in the public interest. He had been facing three separate investigations by the standards commissioner at the time, before Sir Roderick resigned. Sir Roderick, a former high court judge and pro-chancellor of Swansea University, said Mr McEvoy's actions were ""wholly unacceptable"" as he stood down on Monday. Sexism row over 'buxom barmaids' video Watchdog quits UKIP barmaid video probe Leanne Wood reprimanded for swearing on Twitter ""It has come to my attention that conversations with my staff about a variety of highly confidential and sensitive matters have been secretly, and possibly illegally, recorded over a period of what seems to be several months and in what seems to be a number of different locations by an assembly member,"" said Sir Roderick, who had served as the assembly's standards commissioner since 2017. ""These have included highly confidential conversations with my staff including references to cases brought by members of the public. ""That a member of our national assembly could behave in this way is wholly unacceptable. It undermines the integrity of the complaints procedure and brings our democratic process into disrepute. ""I'm not prepared to continue in my role as standards commissioner."" Neil McEvoy said he had acted lawfully in the public interest Welsh Assembly presiding officer Elin Jones said she had accepted Sir Roderick's resignation, and the process to find a successor will now begin. She said: ""Covert recording of private conversations is a serious matter and we will be asking South Wales Police to investigate how such recordings were obtained. ""Arrangements have been made for a sweep of the Senedd estate to locate any unauthorised electronic surveillance devices."" In response to Mr McEvoy, the standards commissioner's office said: ""The appropriateness of covert recordings of private and confidential conversations will be considered by the relevant authorities in due course."" Sir Roderick was embroiled in a row last year after he said a video featuring a Labour AM's face superimposed on a woman in a low-cut top was not sexist. Earlier in 2019 he was accused ofdouble standards after he recommended a Plaid Cymru AM Leanne Wood be reprimanded for a swear word in a tweet.

"The Labour Party is attempting to defuse a row that has seen British Hindus urged not to vote for them at the general election. There has been much anger from Hindu communities over Labour passing a motion criticising India's actions in Kashmir at its annual conference. It has led to claims the party is ""anti-Indian"" and ""anti-Hindu"". Labour has now distanced itself from the conference motion after criticism from a major Hindu charity. Why India and Pakistan fight over Kashmir Kashmir profile - Timeline For decades, Kashmir has been a point of contention between India and Pakistan - both believe it should be part of their country. Over the summer, India withdrew the special status of Jammu and Kashmir that had enabled this region to make its own laws and have its own flag. Following this, Labour members passed a motion at the party's conference in September saying there was a humanitarian crisis in the disputed territory and that the people of Kashmir should be given the right of self-determination. This provoked much anger from Indians - most of whom are of Hindu faith - in the UK and abroad. Umesh Chander Sharma, chairman of Hindu Council UK, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme most Hindus were ""very upset and very angry"" about Labour's position and the charity, which is meant to be politically impartial, was ""against"" it. He said his organisation had to ""defend the Hindu cause"". And he added that some people who usually vote Labour will be voting for the Conservatives because of the issue. ""They are, they are (voting Tory), they are very clear, they are very evident, there is no ifs or buts, they are very openly saying that,"" he told the Today programme. TheTimes of India recently reported,externalthat the overseas friends of India's ruling party - the BJP - will be encouraging Hindus not to vote for Labour in marginal seats, which could make all the difference at 12 December's UK general election. The Today programme has seen WhatsApp messages sent to Hindus across the country urging them to vote Conservatives. One message reads, ""The Labour Party has blindly supported Pakistan's propaganda against the issue of Article 370 in Kashmir.  Labour Party is against India - the Conservative party isn't"".  These messages have come from members of Hindu organisations as well as individuals of Hindu and Indian heritage. Why a special law on Kashmir is controversial Pakistan PM calls for Kashmir resolution Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi, Labour's candidate in Slough, recently urged people of Hindu and Sikh faith not to ""fall for the divisive tactics of religious hardliners, trying to wedge apart our cohesive community, circulating lies on WhatsApp"". Now Labour Party chairman Ian Lavery has stepped in to reassure Hindus that the party is ""fully aware of the sensitivities that exist over the situation in Kashmir"". ""We recognise that the language used in the emergency motion has caused offence in some sections of the Indian diaspora, and in India itself,"" he said in a statement. ""We are adamant that the deeply felt and genuinely held differences on the issue of Kashmir must not be allowed to divide communities against each other here in the UK. Labour Party chairman Ian Lavery has stepped in to reassure Hindus He said the party's official position was that ""Kashmir is a bilateral matter for India and Pakistan to resolve together by means of a peaceful solution which protects the human rights of the Kashmiri people and respects their right to have a say in their own future"". He added that Labour was ""opposed to external interference in the political affairs of any other country"" - and would ""not adopt any anti-India or anti-Pakistan position over Kashmir"". According to official figures, there are more than a million Hindus in Great Britain, while there are more than three million Muslims. Research by the Runnymede Trust,externalshows that in 2015 and 2017, Labour remained the most popular party among ethnic minority voters (77% of them voted Labour in 2017). The report says ethnic minority voters made up one in 5 of Labour voters but only one in 20 of Conservative voters.

"Britain's withdrawal from the European Union - Brexit - is seen by many voters as a key issue in this general election. Here, we answer a selection of readers' questions about the two subjects. At their party conference in September 2019,Liberal Democrats voted for a motionsaying that if the party became the government at the next general election, it wouldrevoke Article 50. This is part of EU law which gives any country the right to leave the EU. According to a2018 ruling by the European Court of Justice,external(ECJ), the UK could do this on its own, without asking the other 27 EU members, by writing a letter to the European Council, a body made up of EU heads of state or government. The ECJ added that after revocation, the UK would remain an EU member on the same terms as it has now. The government hasruled out forming an election pact with Brexit Party during the election campaign.But if the Conservatives fell short of a majority, and the Brexit Party won a handful of crucial seats - then it may choose to support the Conservatives on specific issues in order to get Brexit over the line. So a temporary alliance of convenience is probably more likely than a formal coalition government. At thelaunch of the Liberal Democrats' general election campaign, the party's leader, Jo Swinson, said she was ""absolutely, categorically ruling out Lib Dem votes putting Jeremy Corbyn in No 10"". And,speaking at a Unite union conferencein Scotland in October 2019, Jeremy Corbyn vowed that there would be ""no pacts with any other party, we are fighting that election to win it in every part of the UK"". So, the parties have been very clear about not wanting to enter coalitions - or other types of agreement. But in a hung Parliament, where no party has a majority of seats in the House of Commons, it's possible that they could reconsider that position. The convention is that the prime minister is an MP and the leader of the largest party in the House of Commons. However, in years gone by, many prime ministers were members of the House of Lords. The last of these was Lord Salisbury, who left office in 1902. And in 1963, the 14th Earl of Home, later Sir Alec Douglas-Home, left the House of Lords within a few days of being appointed PM. He was elected to the House of Commons in a by-election. However, a Brexit Party majority looks distinctly unlikely, after it announced itwould no longer field candidates in more than 300 Tory seats. More Your Questions Answered: Is my postal vote safe? General election 2019: Will this be a Brexit election? Brexit: All you need to know about the UK leaving the EU A really simple guide to the general election More news explainers Labour iscommitted to holding another referendumon whether to leave the EU. If the country voted to Remain, then free movement between the UK and EU would continue. Even if Brexit happens, Labour may try to retain free movement, which means British and EU citizens would still be able to live and work in whichever country they choose. A motion to that effect was passedat the 2019 Labour Party conference,but we need to wait for Labour's election manifesto to see if it also becomes a formal policy pledge. It is highly unlikely that visas will be introduced, unless relations between the UK and EU deteriorate dramatically. But it partly depends on whether the UK leaves the EU with a deal or not. Leaving with a deal will probably mean that both sides agree travel between the two will not require a visa. But if there was a no-deal Brexit, the UK would immediately be treated by the EU as a ""third country"", making it equivalent to other non-EU states. In that scenario, it will be down to the UK and individual EU member countries to decide whether visas are needed for travel between them. If there is a no-deal Brexit, the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland will become the land border between the UK and the EU. This means each will have different regulations and customs rules. The EU insists that the Irish government would have to take stepsto protect the integrity of the single market,an agreement which allows goods, people, services and money to move around between countries that are a part of it. It says it wants to prevent products which do not meet EU standards arriving from the UK. This means some checks would have to take place. What is not clear is how exactly this would happen. To date, the government has set aside Â£6.3bn for Brexit planning. The previous chancellor, Philip Hammond,had made available Â£4.2bnfor Brexit preparations from mid-2016, including recruiting more civil service staff. In August 2019, Mr Hammond's successor, Sajid Javid, saidan extra Â£2.1bn of funding would be made availableto prepare for the possibility of a no-deal Brexit, including more border force officers and upgrades to transport infrastructure at ports. Businesses have also spent a huge amount of money preparing for Brexit, but it is hard to put a precise figure on how much has been spent in the private sector. Yes, the transition period - the time between the UK leaving the EU with a deal and and finally quitting it altogether under the terms of a new relationship - can be extended. While the proposed transition period will run until the end of December 2020, it can in theory be extended by one or two years. The government, though, has insisted that it will not ask for any extension of the deadline. It meansthat if no free trade agreement is completed in time,then the UK might have to trade with the EU onthe most basic World Trade Organization rulesfrom the beginning of 2021.

"Last weekend, BBC News economics editor Faisal Islam and I launched a project to try to get beneath the digital skin of this election. We each tweeted avideo asking anyone who saw a political advert in their Facebook feed to send it to us,external, along with the ""Why am I seeing this ad?"" information that pops up when you click on a menu. We were not sure anyone would respond - but quickly the emails began to flood in. So far, we have received more than 600 messages with screenshots of election adverts and the information about how they have been targeted. Here's what we have learned so far. Labour, the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats all got off the mark quickly, with our respondents sending us a variety of ads. And as the week went on, ads from the Brexit Party and the SNP started coming in. But what was striking was the number of non-party organisations getting involved. The most notable example was the Fair Tax Campaign,whose ad attacking Labour's tax plans was sent in by three people. It appeared without the ""Paid for by"" information Facebook requires - and when we contacted the social media giant, the advert was taken down. A few days later, it was back with the message: ""Paid for by Alexander Karcejwski Crowley,"" confirmation a former aide to Boris Johnson who left Downing Street in late September was behind the campaign. Other organisations posting ads included Parent's Choice, a campaign attacking Labour's education plans, funded by former Conservative minister Richard Tracey. Ads were also run by Best for Brexit and Best for Britain - two campaigns on opposite sides of the Brexit debate. And on Sunday, we got our first email with an ad from the Hope Not Hate campaign - not endorsing any party but attacking Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage and Tory leader Boris Johnson. The Conservatives started with very targeted adverts aimed at key marginal constituencies, including Bridgend, with the message only a few thousand votes were needed ""to get Brexit done"". In some cases the Conservative Party specifically targeted young males But later they broadened out with an attack on Jeremy Corbyn. Within hours of former Labour minister Ian Austin's call for voters to abandon the party, the Labour leader was featured in an ad. Who have parties been targeting on social media? Facebook bans political ad posted by ex-Downing Street aide How political parties choose election candidates Labour's ads have focused on the NHS and the claim Mr Johnson poses a threat to it. One message featured a Guardian article about suggestions the UK could pay more for drugs following any trade deal with US President Donald Trump. Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrats have been hammering away with a message they will stop Brexit and ""the two old parties have failed Britain"". One Lib Dem ad was targeted at Guardian-reading users who also watch the BBC's Mock The Week programme, a satirical look at the news While some of the early Tory ads were closely geographically targeted, later on they all seemed broad-brush. The ""Why am I seeing this ad?"" message often read: ""Conservatives want to reach people like their customers,"" over 18 and in England. But in a couple of cases, the target was more specific - males aged 23 to 30, people aged 55 or over, or women with degrees aged 30 to 50. Labour's approach to targeting is more opaque. Many of its ads told readers Facebook had ""matched your information with information on"" a list Labour wanted to reach, derived from a ""hashed list"" uploaded by Experian Marketing Services. A Labour Party advert used data from Experian to target users Experian told us it used publicly available data from sources such as the electoral roll - matched with Facebook users, but then anonymised - ""to target relevant communications to particular sections of the population"". This does not include credit scores, it added. Facebook, meanwhile, said it ""does not learn any new identifying information about a person when a business uploads a list"". The Liberal Democrats are somewhat more obvious in their targeting. Their ad about the ""old parties"" is often aimed at people aged 18 to 35. And their media habits often seem to be a focus - one advert targeted at Michael Gove's Surrey Heath constituency was trying to reach ""people who Facebook thinks are interested in The Guardian and Mock the Week"". The Brexit Party has tended to target people in specific locations, from Frome in Somerset to Skipton in Yorkshire. Those targeted by adverts on Facebook are able to find out how they came to be selected But one ""Why am I seeing this?"" message gives useful insights into the workings of Facebook's ""lookalike audience"" feature, used by many of the parties. ""The Brexit Party identified a group of existing customers that it wanted to use to find similar customers,"" the message said. ""Facebook used this group of existing customers to find potential customers for the advertiser."" Much has been made of the way Facebook allows political campaigns to micro-target their ads, crafting hundreds of different messages suited to the personalities of each individual. So far, however, our project seems to suggest this whole idea may have been oversold. We have seen no evidence voters are seeing lots of different messages, indeed the same adverts keep cropping up all over the country. And we are hearing plenty of scepticism about targeting, with respondents convinced the parties are missing the mark both geographically and when it comes to their political preferences. ""They got my age right is all you can say,"" wrote one person about a Conservative ad aimed at anyone over 18. ""I live in Wales and never voted Tory and never will."" Someone in the Chorley constituency of the new speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle wondered why the Labour Party was targeting him with an ad when it would not need to contest that seat. Plenty of people reported ads that made incorrect assumptions about their location - suggesting Facebook can often be a blunt instrument. Most bizarrely, one ad urging a vote for the Conservatives in the Wirral West constituency to ""get Brexit done"" was received in Clitheroe  - and actually appeared to have been targeted at the Lancashire town. ""Nowhere near. We're about 89 miles roughly north of the Wirral peninsula,"" wrote the Clitheroe-based recipient, helpfully attaching a Google Maps screenshot.

"This video can not be played Farage: ""Nothing is good enough"" for the Tories Nigel Farage has insisted he will stand candidates in Labour-held marginal seats, despite coming under pressure from the Conservatives to step aside. The Brexit Party leader announced on Monday that his candidates would not run in seats won by the Tories at the 2017 general election. But he told ITV his candidates would contest Labour seats as they had ""turned [their] back on Brexit"". Tory Chairman James Cleverly warned the plan posed a ""danger"" to his party. Mr Farage said 300 nomination papers for his MPs had been signed off, saying he will ""take the fight to Labour"". The Brexit Party had been due to hold a rally in central London later, but a spokesman said they had cancelled it as ""we have already said what we needed to say"". LIVE: Farage says Tory candidates should make way Brexit Party MEP quits as election candidate Brexit Party rules out standing in Tory seats Election poll tracker: How do the parties compare? The Brexit Party had planned to run candidates in more than 600 seats after Prime Minister Boris Johnson rejected an offer from its leader for a ""Leave alliance"" to deliver Brexit. But facing pressure from his own party - as well as the Conservatives - not to divide Brexit-backing voters, Mr Farage confirmed his candidates would not stand in the 317 seats won by the Tories at the last election. He told ITV's Good Morning Britain: ""I made a big, generous offer to the Conservative Party yesterday [Monday]. I gifted them a couple of dozen seats."" Mr Farage later criticised the Tories for not reciprocating his move by standing aside in some Labour areas where the Brexit Party could challenge the incumbent. He told the BBC: ""I would have expected, having put country before party, to perhaps have got something back from the Conservatives. ""But no, nothing is good enough for them."" He added: ""It is clear to me it is not a Leave majority they want in Parliament, it is just a Tory one."" The Brexit Party leader said the seats where the party was standing down were in areas that the Conservatives were facing ""huge pressure"" from the Liberal Democrats. By giving the Tories a clear run, Mr Farage said his actions would stop more Remain MPs getting into Parliament and prevent a further referendum on Brexit from becoming a reality. But in Labour-held seats in the north of England and the Midlands - which the Tories are targeting - it was ""a very different set of circumstances"". Mr Farage said his party would ""take more Labour votes"" than Conservative ones and would have a chance of winning in traditional Labour areas that would not usually vote Tory. He also said by winning those seats, the Brexit Party would ensure Parliament had a majority of MPs in favour of leaving the EU. ""I have given more ground than anyone you have ever spoken to in the interest of putting country before party,"" Mr Farage told GMB. ""I have given that ground now and I am clear we will fight against Labour and the Remainers in Parliament."" Analysis by Jonathan Blake, BBC political correspondent No sooner had Nigel Farage announced his decision to withdraw candidates from Conservative-held seats did pressure begin building on him to go further. Standing against the Conservatives in Leave-voting constituencies could split the Brexiteer vote and stop the Tories taking seats from Labour. Many of Boris Johnson's top targets are Labour-held areas in the Midlands and north of England, where a few hundred votes could determine the result. It is highly unlikely that the Conservatives will stand aside in some of those constituencies as Mr Farage would like, so for now at least, he is digging in. But it is risky for the man who claims to put the higher purpose of Brexit above his own political ambition to be seen as the person standing in the way of the UK leaving the EU. He would dispute that, of course. But Nigel Farage has gone from saying Boris Johnson's deal was ""not Brexit"" to backing it in a matter of days and he may not have made his final move. Mr Cleverly told BBC Politics Live on Monday that Mr Farage's Party could split the vote in the Conservative target seats, leading to the election of MPs who could ""frustrate"" Brexit.

A former Brexit Party candidate has attacked his leader for the strategy. Robert Wheal was due to stand as a candidate in the Arundel and South Downs constituency, but has been stood down as part of the move. He tweeted Mr Farage was ""finished as a politician"", adding: ""It's putting Nigel before the country. He will go down in infamy, letting down so many good people with whom he sought their trust. ""All that Farage has exposed is his duplicity to so many supporters who had put their faith in him."" Mr Wheal said Leave supporters could ""kiss goodbye"" to Brexit, and said he would spoil his ballot paper in the 12 December poll. Brexit Party MEP Alexandra Phillips also criticised Mr Farage's decision, tweeting she had been ""disenfranchised by my own party"" and will not vote in the election. This video can not be played Brexit Party MEP: ""Choice is taken away from me"" But in another tweet, Ms Phillips urged everyone who could to support the Brexit Party. ""We have done what is politically necessary albeit totally galling to stave off the greatest electoral threat to Brexit: a Remain coalition,"" she wrote. ""Those who want full fat freedom and who can vote Brexit Party must do it to beat the duopoly."" The Brexit Party's MEP for Scotland, Louis Stedman-Bryce, has quit as a general election candidate in protest at Mr Farage's decision not to field candidates in seats held by the Tories. Mr Stedman-Bryce, who had planned to stand in Glasgow North East, said he backed an agreement with the Conservatives in Scotland to help fight the SNP - but he could not support a UK-wide arrangement because he did not approve of Mr Johnson's Brexit deal. Analysis by Peter Barnes, senior elections and political analyst, BBC News The Brexit Party's decision to stand aside in constituencies the Conservatives won in 2017 should make it easier for them to hold on to those seats. In marginals like St Ives and Mansfield, it ought to help them keep a bigger share of the pro-Leave vote. However, to win a majority in the House of Commons the Conservatives need to win more seats - not just hold on to what they have. And in those places the presence of a Brexit Party candidate may get in the Conservatives' way. The best estimates suggest that 29 of the Conservatives top 50 targets, and 59 of the top 100, are in Labour-held seats that voted Leave in the referendum. If the strategy is to target Leave voters in those places, it would probably better to have a clear run - without the Brexit Party.

"An evacuation has been ordered in Fishlake, South Yorkshire Labour and the Lib Dems have criticised the government for its handling of severe flooding in northern England.

"Sarah Barrass, 35, and Brandon Machin, 39, were half-siblings in a secret sexual relationship, police said The parents of six children murdered their two teenage sons the day after a bid to poison them failed. Sarah Barrass and Brandon Machin, who is her half-brother, strangled Tristan and Blake Barrass, aged 13 and 14, in Shiregreen, Sheffield, in May. The court heard how Barrass, 35, would regularly tell her children: ""I gave you life, I can take it away."" Barrass and Machin, 39, were both sentenced to a minimum of 35 years in prison at Sheffield Crown Court. They have both previously admitted murder, conspiracy to murder all six of their children, including Blake and Tristan, and five counts of attempted murder. The court heard how Barrass strangled Tristan with her dressing gown cord, before Machin strangled Blake with his hands. They then put plastic bags over the boys' heads, suffocating them. South Yorkshire Police said Barrass, of Gregg House Road, Shiregreen, and Machin, of Burngreave Road, had been in a secret sexual relationship for years. Blake (left) was strangled by Machin, and Tristan was strangled by Barrass Fearing they would be found out by the authorities and their children taken into care, they hatched a plot to kill them. Police said the plan was for Machin to discover what had happened and raise the alarm. On the evening of 23 May, Barrass tried to poison the four eldest children, by collecting tablets prescribed to one of the children for ADHD and forcing them to swallow them. Kama Melly QC, prosecuting, said: ""None of the children wanted to take the tablets but were forced to do so. ""The defendants expected the tablets to kill the children overnight."" Murder plot survivor 'fears becoming a killer' More stories from around Yorkshire When it became apparent the plan had failed, Barrass began to search online for other ways of killing her children, including suffocation, strangulation and drowning. She contacted Machin to tell him they were still alive and the pair then strangled the boys and placed bin bags over their heads ""to ensure their certain death"", Ms Melly said. The defendants then ran a bath and repeatedly tried to drown one of the younger children. When that too failed, Barrass took the surviving children - two of whom are under the age of 13, and two under three - to the bedroom and phoned the police. Bikers provided an escort for the funeral of Tristan and Blake in August The court heard Barrass had previously approached the local authority to ask for help with her children. Ms Melly said the mother sent a message to a friend which said: ""I've thought of every possible solution to this mess. ""I love my kids too much to kill them, I can't put them into care for the same reason."" Bryan Cox QC, mitigating for Barrass, said she was ""profoundly damaged by her childhood"". He said: ""The defendant was desperate to prevent her children being taken into care. ""She couldn't cope with the prospect of them being removed."" The court heard she told police she planned to kill the younger two children and herself, after the older four had died. Mr Justice Goss, sentencing, said to Barrass: ""You considered your love for them and fear of being parted from them entitled you to take their lives as well as your own."" Speaking after the sentencing, Edmund Hulbert from the Crown Prosecution Service said: ""This was an appalling crime in which two young lives were lost, and a family torn apart, leaving a community in shock. ""Two of the surviving children witnessed their older siblings being attacked and the trauma that all the children have experienced, and will continue to experience, is unimaginable. ""It is paramount now that the surviving children are allowed to rebuild their lives in peace."" Matthew Saunders, a friend of the murdered boys, said outside court: ""A piece of all our hearts died on 24 May 2019, which we will never get back. ""Blake and Tristan leave a huge empty void in our lives, and we did not get chance to say goodbye. ""We are relieved justice has been served, but it should never have come to this.""

"This video can not be played Ewan Fisher: 'Everything just got worse and worse... I nearly lost my life' A teenage boy nearly died after vaping caused a catastrophic reaction in his lungs, doctors in Nottingham say. Ewan Fisher was connected to an artificial lung to keep him alive after his own lungs failed and he could not breathe. Ewan told BBC News e-cigarettes had ""basically ruined me"" and urged other young people not to vape. His doctors say vaping is ""not safe"", although health bodies in the UK say it is 95% safer than tobacco. Listen: Beyond Today - Can vaping kill you? Vaping: How popular are e-cigarettes? Ewan started vaping in early 2017. He was 16 at the time and wanted to quit smoking to improve his boxing. Despite being under age, he said, ""it was easy"" to buy either cigarettes or e-cigarettes. In May that year, Ewan was finding it harder and harder to breathe. His mother took Ewan to accident and emergency on the night before his GCSE exams, because he was coughing and choking in his sleep. His lungs were failing and he very quickly ended up on life-support in intensive care in Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham. ""I thought I was going to die,"" Ewan told BBC News. Ewan was getting worse. Even ventilation could not get enough oxygen into his body and his life was in the balance. Ewan was attached to an ECMO machine to keep him alive He was taken to Leicester and attached to an artificial lung or ECMO (extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation) machine. ""This machine saved my life,"" he said. Large tubes took blood out of Ewan, removed the carbon dioxide, added oxygen and pumped the blood back into his body. ""He had very serious respiratory failure, he had to go to ECMO and that is a very big deal,"" Dr Jayesh Bhatt, a consultant at Nottingham University Hospitals, told BBC News. ""He got as ill as anyone can get."" The case - from May 2017 - has just come to lightin the journal Archives of Disease in Childhood,external. Ewan, who is 19 on Tuesday, had a long recovery. It was six months before he was properly up and on his feet again. ""I'm still not back to normal, I'd say 75-80%, it's in the last six months that I'm feeling a bit stronger in myself,"" he said. ""Vaping has basically ruined me, I try to tell everyone and they think I'm being stupid, I tell my mates and they don't listen. ""They still do it... but they've seen what I've been through. ""Is it worth risking your life for smoking e-cigs? ""I don't want you to end up like me and I don't want you to be dead, I wouldn't wish [that] on anyone."" Ewan also fears being around other vapers - everywhere from the pub to High Street - could damage his lungs again. His doctors say the answer is yes. Ewan developed a condition called hypersensitivity pneumonitis - something he was breathing in was setting off his immune system, with catastrophic consequences. ""You get an over-exuberant inflammatory response and the lungs pay a price and develop respiratory failure,"" Dr Bhatt said. One of the most common forms of hypersensitivity pneumonitis is ""bird fancier's lung"", which is caused by particles from feathers or bird droppings. When scientists tested the two e-cigarette liquids Ewan had been using, they found one of them was triggering an immune reaction. Dr Bhatt said: ""The real learning point is vaping is not safe, especially for young people, they should never go near it. ""We consider e-cigarettes as 'much safer than tobacco' at our peril."" There are 3.6 million people vaping in the UK and reactions like this are rare. 'Half as many Britons' vape as smoke However, doctors have told BBC News Ewan's case is not an isolated incident. ""As vaping becomes more popular, we are beginning to see more cases,"" Dr Hemant Kulkarni, a consultant in paediatric respiratory medicine at Sheffield Children's NHS Foundation Trust, said. He told BBC News: ""Some of the cases my colleagues and I have seen are teenagers presenting with severe lung injury and some of these have been life-threatening. ""However, in the cases I've been involved in, patients are now regaining normal lung function."" Dr Kulkarni is ""surprised"" e-cigarettes are advertised in the UK, given the severe reaction they can cause in children and a lack of scientific studies on their safety. Smoking is pretty much the worst thing you can do for your health. E-cigarettes are promoted in the UK as a way to quit because they let people inhale nicotine in vapour rather than breathing in smoke. Ewan's reaction was extreme, but what about the rest of us who would not end up with hypersensitivity pneumonitis? India e-cigarettes: Ban announced to prevent youth 'epidemic' Public Health England says vaping is 95% safer than smoking but is not without risks. Rosanna O' Connor, the body's director of drugs, alcohol and tobacco, said: ""Smoking kills half of lifelong smokers and accounts for almost 220 deaths in England every day. ""Our advice remains that while not completely risk free, UK regulated e-cigarettes carry a fraction of the risk of smoked tobacco."" But there are arguments about how safe vaping really is. The World Health Organization says,externale-cigarettes are ""undoubtedly harmful and should therefore be subject to regulation"". It also raises concerns vaping is being aggressively marketed at young people - particularly through the use of flavourings - and risked re-normalising smoking. The deaths of 39 people in the US have been connected to vaping and have prompted worldwide concern about its safety. There have been 2,051 cases of e-cigarette, or vaping, product use associated lung injury (called EVALI)in the outbreak,external. Most of those cases, but not all, have been linked to vaping THC, the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis. Ewan was using standard e-cigarettes bought from a shop. Dr Nick Hopkinson, medical director of the British Lung Foundation, said: ""If people switch completely from smoking to vaping, they will substantially reduce their health risk as e-cigarettes do not contain tobacco and any harmful components are present at a much lower level. ""People who do switch should try to quit vaping in the long term too but not at the expense of relapsing to smoking - and non-smokers should not take up vaping."" Prof John Britton, the director of the UK Centre for Tobacco and Alcohol Studies, at the University of Nottingham, said: ""This is worrying, and the risk needs to be acknowledged, but in absolute terms it is extremely small and, crucially, far smaller than that of smoking. ""The advice remains the same: if you smoke, switch to vaping; if you don't smoke, don't vape."" Follow Jameson Twitter,external.

"Auschwitz-Birkenau was the most notorious death camp built in Nazi-occupied Poland Poland's prime minister has written to streaming company Netflix insisting on changes to The Devil Next Door, a documentary about the Nazi death camps. Mateusz Morawiecki said a map shown in the series locates the death camps within modern-day Poland's borders. This misrepresents Poland as being responsible for the death camps, when it was actually occupied by Germany in World War Two, Mr Morawiecki said. Netflix told Reuters it was aware of concerns regarding the documentary. Nazi Germany invaded Poland in 1939, which marked the beginning of the war. New Holocaust law threatens 'whitewash' of Polish history Poland still counts losses from WW2 invasion The Germans built concentration camps including at Auschwitz, killing millions of people, most of them Jews. Mr Morawiecki said in his letter to Reed Hastings, the CEO of Netflix, that it was important to ""honour the memory and preserve the truth about World War II and the Holocaust"". He accused ""certain works"" on Netflix of being ""hugely inaccurate"" and ""rewriting history"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""I believe that this terrible mistake has been committed unintentionally,"" Mr Morawiecki added. Polish leader vows anti-Semitism fight Holocaust survivor meets baby he saved in WW2 Ritual beating of Judas effigy 'was anti-Semitic' Last year,Poland introduced lawscriminalising language implying Polish responsibility for the atrocities committed by Nazi Germany. However,an international outcry prompted the government to remove the threat of three-year jail terms. More than five million Poles were killed during World War Two, including up to three million Jews who were murdered in the Nazi Holocaust. The death camps were planned and operated by occupying German SS units. There were, however, some Polish atrocities against Jews and other civilians during and after the war. In 1941, Polish villagers in Jedwabne, perhaps at the instigation of the Nazis, rounded up more than 300 of their Jewish neighbours and burned them alive in a barn.

"Sajid Javid says Labour would ""massively increase borrowing and debt"", and ""hike up taxes"" The Conservatives have launched a fresh attack on what they say are Labour's ""reckless"" spending plans. Labour has yet to publish its election manifesto but the Tories have claimed that there is a ""black hole"" in its economic policies. The Tories have tried to calculate the additional taxes they believe a Labour government would have to introduce if they win power on 12 December. Labour has dismissed the figures as ""more fake news"" from Tory HQ. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell insisted an incoming Labour government would not raise VAT or national insurance, while 95% of people would not pay any more in income tax. Live: Latest election news Personal tax rises would be confined to the top 5% of earners, he said - a policy carried overfrom its 2017 manifesto. Both main parties are planning to borrow money to spend on infrastructure projects if they win the general election, while Labour has said it will pay for some of its spending pledges by reversing Conservative reductions in corporation tax. Chancellor Sajid Javid claimed that Labour would also ""hike up taxes"" to pay for its programme, estimating that this would amount to an extra Â£2,400 per year for every taxpayer. ""The British people have made huge progress over the last decade in repairing the damage left to us by the last Labour government,"" he said. ""If Jeremy Corbyn gets into power he would throw all that hard work away."" The Conservatives are repeatingtheir previous claimthat Labour plans to spend Â£1.2tn over the next five years, which forms the basis of this new claim. But this is problematic because it makes a number of assumptions about what Labour intends to spend before it has published a manifesto. Not only have those same assumptions been repeated in this analysis, but additional ones have been made about Labour's tax-raising plans. For example, the Conservatives say Labour is considering a ""homes tax"" which would cost households up to Â£375 more than the current Council Tax system, raising an extra Â£10.2bn. However, this seems to be based on a policy-proposal document put forward by Guardian columnist George Monbiot and commissioned for the Labour Party. Thesummary of the paper,externaleven states: ""The following are proposals to the Labour Party, which will consider these as part of its policy development process in advance of the next general election."" To get to the Â£2,400 figure, the Conservatives have assumed Labour intends to spend Â£651bn on day-to-day spending (which comes from their original Â£1.2tn calculation) over five years. From there, the Conservatives say that Labour only plans to raise Â£277bn over the same period, leaving a shortfall of Â£374bn. So, if you then divide the shortfall by 31.2m UK taxpayers, you arrive at Â£2,400 a year each (or Â£12,000 per taxpayer over five years) to plug the gap. In summary, this analysis is based on assumptions about money Labour intends to spend but also how much revenue the party intends to raise. Until the manifestos are published, it is impossible to accurately identify any spending gaps. BBC political correspondent Chris Mason said the Conservatives' attack was part of a clear attempt to build an argument about what they call the ""cost of Corbyn"". But asked how much another Conservative government would cost taxpayers during a BBC interview, Chief Secretary to the Treasury Rishi Sunak did not provide a figure. ""The forecasts that there are from the OBR (Office for Budget Responsibility) show that there is a Â£30bn surplus on the current balance over the next few years - so we take in Â£30bn more than is spent on day-to-day spending,"" he told Radio 4's Today. ""We've said we will invest about Â£13.5bn of that on people's priorities like the NHS, like schools, like policing. We will not tax people extra for those day to day priorities."" Mr McDonnell said the Tories were unable to say how they would pay for their spending commitments. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Cynthia Tuck was married to her husband George for 39 years ""I felt devastated, absolutely devastated and so guilty. My life collapsed really"". Cynthia Tuck remembers the moment she realised she had been conned out of her life savings, and those of her late husband, George. She'd become one of dozens of victims of a sophisticated, organised scam offering hugely over-valued coloured diamonds as ""investments"". But realising she'd been conned wasn't the end of Cynthia's misery. A three-year fight for justice - involving five different police forces and multiple investigations - would ultimately lead nowhere. Cynthia and her family have been feeling nothing but anger, resentment and frustration towards the justice system because the people who were involved in the scam got off scot-free. No charges. No trial. No justice. Cynthia Tuck began her career as a nurse and then worked as a health visitor Elderly, often vulnerable, people were targeted, sometimes over the course of many years. Victims were persuaded, through a variety of different tactics, to buy poor quality diamonds at hugely inflated prices. In Cynthia's case, she was cold-called by a man called Colin Moore and persuaded to pay around Â£5,000 for a diamond in 2013 as an ""investment"". Official-looking websites, glossy brochures, lunch meetings and, crucially, seemingly genuine certificates promising good returns all helped legitimise the con. Then, over the course of three years, Colin Moore, while working for two different companies, ruthlessly exploited Cynthia's vulnerabilities and persuaded her into handing over nearly Â£400,000 - every penny she and her husband had saved over a lifetime of work - for 21 diamonds. The diamonds her family eventually managed to track down (they suspect some of them never even existed) were sold for less than 10% of the amount Cynthia paid for them. Two of the certificates that played such a crucial role in helping persuade Cynthia Tuck her ""investments"" were genuine DC Paul Gilmour is a specialist fraud investigator with Sussex Police. ""Fraudsters are very good at what they do,"" he says. ""They use tactics to socially engineer their victims, they know what to say, they know how to approach people. ""[They are] cunning. They may build that trust and abuse that trust over several weeks or months with someone."" ""It was a date etched in my memory forever: 1 February, 2016,"" says Cynthia's daughter Rachel. ""We knew that mum was buying some diamonds but we didn't know that she had bought so many diamonds, at what cost, and who she was dealing with."" But when Cynthia finally told her daughter about the scale of the fraud and what had happened to her, Rachel was stunned. ""I found out on the same day how much money mum had and how much had been stolen from her. And I experienced that like a sort of shock, like a physical shock really. I felt physically sick."" So began the family's three-year struggle to see the people behind the scam held to account. At one time or another five police forces were involved and multiple investigations were launched. The Insolvency Service did shut down several of the companies involved in the scam, including the two Colin Moore worked for, as well as banning two people from being directors. But, ultimately, no charges were ever brought and no-one ever faced trial. George Tuck was left for dead during the battle of Monte Cassino in World War Two, but recovered to have a successful career as a civil engineer Police and Crime Commissioner Anthony Stansfeld speaks for the Association of PCCs on fraud. He says victims such as Cynthia are being ""failed"" by the police; ""I think [Cynthia's case] is typical of what's going on throughout the country. ""Fraud is not being investigated. I doubt if 1% of fraud is ever brought to a conclusion in the courts. ""It is very difficult for the police to investigate. Very often police will say it's a civil matter or pass it to Action Fraud - and so things simply do not get investigated."" According to the crime survey for England and Wales, there were 3.9 million reports of fraud in the year to June 2019, a 15% increase from the previous year. Mr Stansfeld says police are not being given enough resources to properly tackle the problem and suggests money from fines issued by the Financial Conduct Authority, sometimes hundreds of millions of pounds each year, should be spent doing just that. ""That money [from the fines] goes to the Treasury. It should not. At least half of it should be ring-fenced for fighting fraud and if we couldn't bring down fraud by about 10% I would be amazed."" The Home Office says the government is committed to ""cracking down on scammers and fraudsters"" and has just launched a review into the issue. Having given up hope long ago of getting any of her mum's money back, Rachel says her big worry now is that the people who conned her mum are still out on the streets. ""[The victims] were targeted. They were groomed. And then the authorities blame the victims."" Naturally, File on 4 wanted to find Colin Moore. After weeks of calls, emails and letters, it becomes clear just how hard he is to track down. Like a ghost, he's disappeared - we're told possibly to the other side of the world. ""They just let them carry on,"" Rachel says, ""and my real fear and worry is that this is still happening. That the same people are... probably doing exactly the same thing to other old people. And that makes it very hard to live with. And it's been one of the things that has made it hard to put behind us.""

"Today marks one month until election day Labour strongly criticises Boris Johnson's response to flooding in northern England PM holds emergency Cobra meeting on the situation and announces funds so local councils can help affected homes and businesses Lib Dems pledge more funds to prevent flooding in the future if they gain power Politicians from all parties pay tribute to former Labour minister Frank Dobson, following his death aged 79 BBC News is broadcasting from Bishop Auckland in County Durham, a Leave-voting, Labour-held marginal seat Labour says it has suffered a ""sophisticated and large-scale cyber attack on its digital systems"" Policy-wise, Labour sets out a Â£3bn strategy for adult retraining in England The Conservatives continue to attack Jeremy Corbyn's spending plans Nigel Farage says Tories should make way for Brexit Party candidates in seats they cannot hope to win Kate Whannel and Francesca Gillett We're now finishing our live election coverage for today. Thanks for following, and we'll be back tomorrow as the campaigning continues. To read our main story from today,click here. What happened today? Here are the main moments from today: Former Justice Secretary David Gauke has confirmed he will be standing
as an independent candidate at the general election. Mr Gauke, who became the MP for South West Hertfordshire in 2005, had the Tory whip removed after hevoted against Boris Johnson's Brexit deal. He announced he would stand as an independent at the
Political Studies Association awards ceremony tonight. Not all of tomorrow's papers lead with an election story. Among those that do is the Express: The Conservative Party has
suspended party members named in new allegations of Islamophobic social media
posts, allegedly made by 25 current and former Conservative councillors. The Guardian says it has seen a so-called ""dossier"" compiled by an anonymous Twitter user who says they campaign against racism. The dossier contains alleged details of Islamophobia and racist social media content
posted, shared or endorsed by 25 sitting and former Conservative councillors. Not all the names provided are understood to be party members. A Conservative Party
spokesperson said: âAll those found to be party members have been suspended immediately, pending investigation. ""The swift
action we take on not just anti-Muslim discrimination, but discrimination of
any kind, is testament to the seriousness with which we take such issues. âThe Conservative Party
will never stand by when it comes to prejudice and discrimination of any kind. ""Thatâs why we are already establishing the terms of an investigation to make
sure that such instances are isolated and robust processes are in place to
stamp them out as and when they occur.â The Lib Dem candidate in Canterbury, Kent, has decided to pull out of the race, saying he does not want to divide the Remain vote. Tim Walker says the Lib Dems had tried to agree a pact with Labour over the seat, but the talks failed so he made the decision to go himself. But it may not achieve much - as the Lib Dems say they will be selecting a new candidate to contest the seat. Read more here. Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon has spoken during a general election campaign event at Johnstone Town Hall in Renfrewshire. She says Scotland ""stands right now at a crossroads"", and the country ""will have our future imposed on us by the likes of Boris Johnson"" if it does not make its voice heard.

Homes surrounded by water in Fishlake, Doncaster Earlier,the government announcedmeasures to help flood-hit areas in England, following a meeting of the government's emergency Cobra committee. Boris Johnson promised funding for local councils where households and businesses have been affected - equivalent to Â£500 per eligible household - and up to Â£2,500 for small and medium-sized businesses which have suffered severe impacts not covered by insurance. Labour has responded to the flood announcements, saying: ""âToo little, too lateâ isnât even the half of it. ""You canât trust Boris Johnson to look out for the North or the Midlands or protect our communities from flooding,"" said Labour's Jon Trickett. âBut Labour will provide an extra Â£5.6bn in flood defence funding, to level up flood defences over 10 years. âEvery home ruined and every business destroyed demands we act now.â And if you want to read more,here is our Reality Check on whether flood and fire services have been cut. BBC News' digital elections reporter, Joe Tidy, explains more about the cyber attacks which the Labour Party said it has suffered in the past two days. The attacks were DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) which is when ""effectively lots of computers are commandeered to flood a server or a network with too much information, so too many requests, and then that website or server falls over"". ""I always think about buying tickets for Glastonbury,"" he says. ""So many people flood the website at the same time, the website falls over."" He says it's ""very hard to pinpoint exactly who and why they would do this"". But, for ""every pound that is taken away from campaigning to be spent on security is money that could be spent on getting the message out there and getting to voters"", he adds. The estranged wife of former Burton MP Andrew Griffiths has been selected as the Conservative candidate to contest the seat at the general election. Mr Griffiths resigned as a minister last July after a newspaper published sexual messages that he had sent to two barmaids. The parliamentary standards watchdogcleared him of wrongdoing,saying it found no evidence he sent them while he would have been engaged in parliamentary activities. Earlier, Mr Griffiths confirmed he was withdrawing from the selection process after a tied vote last night - and his wife, Kate, would seek selection instead. She'll be defending a majority of more than 10,000. The prime minister leaves the teabag in. That was one revelation that came to light in an election broadcast posted on his Twitter account. The other was that Boris Johnson's favourite band was ""either The Clash or The Rolling Stones"". ""Mainly I listen to the Rolling Stones nowadays, so you can make of that what you will,"" he tells the camera. Richard MossPolitical Editor, BBC Look North If you talk to Labour candidates in seats like Bishop Auckland, they say they are facing two problems. One is Brexit, the other is Jeremy Corbyn. Although the voters on the doorstep like some of Labour's policies, they have personal animosity towards Mr Corbyn. The Tories face challenges too - they thought they were going to make gains in 2017, but they didn't. They underestimated the Labour electoral machine and the history that is here. Their other problem is the Brexit party, which is still standing in seats like this one and could take votes from the Conservatives. The links with Labour are strained here, but are they broken? Conservatives won't take that for granted until the votes are counted. Piers Morgan with his Good Morning Britain co-host Susanna Reid TV presenter Piers Morgan has long been a critic of the so-called ""snowflake"" generation - the derogatory term used to describe younger people by those who view them as more easily-offended or less resilient than older people. But speaking at the annual ITV Palooza event in London tonight, he said he believes the rise of leaders like Boris Johnson and Donald Trump ""is a complete reaction to this PC culture we're now being subjected to"". ""I represent the silent majority who are sick and tired of snowflake central and the PC culture that is now enveloping every part of our lives,"" he said. ""When you spend all your time telling people how to live their lives, the Brits that I know eventually go 'enough'.""  Earlier, it was announced that Steve Bray - the man known for standing in Westminster and shouting ""stop Brexit"" -will stand in the general election. Mr Bray, 50, will contest the Welsh Labour-held constituency of Cynon Valley for the Lib Dems. Mr Bray - who has voted for Labour, the Lib Dems and once for the Tories in previous elections - says his decision to stand for the Lib Dems came after leader Jo Swinson pledged to stop Brexit. Admitting he faces a challenge, he says: ""Its a Labour stronghold. I hope to boost the [Lib Dem] vote in the area. ""As much as I hate to say it, another referendum would just leave divisions. ""If that's what it takes, so be it, but I would rather they put a stop to it at Parliament and they revoke Article 50."" BBC Newsnight's Emily Maitlis joins the team at Brexitcast HQ to talk about an unexpected cameo in the election campaign from former US secretary of state and presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Listen totoday's episode here.  Politicians have taken time out of the campaign trail today to pay tribute to former Labour minister Frank Dobson whohas died aged 79. Mr Dobson was a popular figure in the party and served as health secretary under Tony Blair. Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott called him a ""funny, very kind man"" while Ed Miliband described him as a ""profoundly decent person"". Allow Twitter content?

"Morales supporters clashed with police in La Paz Evo Morales has landed in Mexico where he has been offered asylum after resigning as president of Bolivia amid election fraud protests. In a tweet, he said it hurt to be leaving Bolivia but he would return with more ""strength and energy"". Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard said a Mexican government plane was sent for Mr Morales. Meanwhile, Bolivia's military commander ordered troops to back up police who have clashed with Morales supporters. Some 20 people were reported injured in the clashes. Mr Morales earlier urged his supporters to resist the ""dark powers"" that had forced him to step down. He also tweeted a photo of what he described as ""my first night after leaving the presidency forced out by the coup [organised by opposition leader Carlos] Mesa and [opposition activist Luis Fernando] Camacho with the help of the police"".

The deputy head of the Senate, Jeanine ÃÃ±ez, has said she will take over as interim president until new elections are held. Highs and lows of Evo Morales' presidency Why protesters are on the streets worldwide Mr Morales, a former coca farmer, was first elected in 2006. He has won plaudits for fighting poverty and improving Bolivia's economy but drew controversy by defying constitutional term limits to run for a fourth term in October's election, which is alleged to have been rife with irregularities. Up in El Alto, a city that sits high above La Paz in the Andes, life felt like it had stopped. The cable car that connects the two cities was paralysed, its cabins bobbing in the air in silence. And a normally bustling market place was deserted, stalls shut for fear of looting. Dania was one of the only shopkeepers willing to take a risk. She needs the money, she says. A supporter of Evo Morales, she says his resignation was nothing short of a coup. Crossing the market, Lucy Choque makes her way to work through the burning rubber tyres that were set alight overnight. She just wants the whole thing to be over. Read more: Conflict fills political vacuum after Morales Mr Ebrard announced the decision to grant Mr Morales asylum at a press conference. Mexico has a left-leaning government and has supported Mr Morales. Evo Morales supporters fought running battles with police in La Paz on Monday Mr Ebrard earlier described events in Bolivia as a ""coup"", citing the military's involvement in Mr Morales' resignation. Pressure had been growing on Mr Morales since his narrow victory in last month's presidential election. On Sunday, events moved swiftly. First, the Organization of American States, a regional body, announced its audit of the election had found ""clear manipulation"" and called for the result to be annulled. In response, Mr Morales agreed to hold fresh elections. But his main rival, Carlos Mesa - who came second in the vote - said Mr Morales should not stand in any new vote. What really seemed to tip the balance was the intervention of the chief of the armed forces, Gen Williams Kaliman, who urged Mr Morales to step down in the interests of peace and stability. This video can not be played Watch Evo Morales announce his resignation Announcing his resignation, Mr Morales said he had taken the decision in order to stop fellow socialist leaders from being ""harassed, persecuted and threatened"". He also called his removal a ""coup"". Reports say Mr Morales made the announcement of his resignation from El Chapare, a coca-growing rural area of Cochabamba and a bastion of support for him and his Mas party. Opponents of Mr Morales have been celebrating across Bolivia, setting off fireworks and waving national flags, while his supporters clashed with police in the cities of La Paz and El Alto, according to local media reports.  13 years, 9 monthsin power 38 yearsleading the coca growers' union 54%of the votes won in 2005 election 64%of the votes won in 2009 election 61%of votes won in 2014 election Argentines and Bolivians also took to the streets of Buenos Aires on Monday to protest against his resignation. US President Donald Trump on Monday described the resignation as ""a significant moment for democracy in the Western Hemisphere"". The Russian foreign ministry said a ""wave of violence unleashed by the opposition"" had not allowed the ""presidential mandate of Evo Morales to be completed"". The Cuban president, Miguel DÃ­az Canel, tweeted that what happened was ""a violent and cowardly coup d'etat against democracy in Bolivia by the right"". Socialist-led countries Nicaragua and Venezuela also expressed solidarity with Mr Morales. Spain expressed its concern over the role of Bolivia's army, saying that ""this intervention takes us back to moments in the past history of Latin America"". Ms ÃÃ±ez's announcement that she would take over temporarily came after Vice-President Ãlvaro GarcÃ­a, Senate leader Adriana Salvatierra and House of Deputies' leader Victor Borda had all resigned, leaving her next in line.

"Sajid Javid says Labour would ""massively increase borrowing and debt"", and ""hike up taxes"" The Conservatives have launched a fresh attack on what they say are Labour's ""reckless"" spending plans. Labour has yet to publish its election manifesto but the Tories have claimed that there is a ""black hole"" in its economic policies. The Tories have tried to calculate the additional taxes they believe a Labour government would have to introduce if they win power on 12 December. Labour has dismissed the figures as ""more fake news"" from Tory HQ. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell insisted an incoming Labour government would not raise VAT or national insurance, while 95% of people would not pay any more in income tax. Live: Latest election news Personal tax rises would be confined to the top 5% of earners, he said - a policy carried overfrom its 2017 manifesto. Both main parties are planning to borrow money to spend on infrastructure projects if they win the general election, while Labour has said it will pay for some of its spending pledges by reversing Conservative reductions in corporation tax. Chancellor Sajid Javid claimed that Labour would also ""hike up taxes"" to pay for its programme, estimating that this would amount to an extra Â£2,400 per year for every taxpayer. ""The British people have made huge progress over the last decade in repairing the damage left to us by the last Labour government,"" he said. ""If Jeremy Corbyn gets into power he would throw all that hard work away."" The Conservatives are repeatingtheir previous claimthat Labour plans to spend Â£1.2tn over the next five years, which forms the basis of this new claim. But this is problematic because it makes a number of assumptions about what Labour intends to spend before it has published a manifesto. Not only have those same assumptions been repeated in this analysis, but additional ones have been made about Labour's tax-raising plans. For example, the Conservatives say Labour is considering a ""homes tax"" which would cost households up to Â£375 more than the current Council Tax system, raising an extra Â£10.2bn. However, this seems to be based on a policy-proposal document put forward by Guardian columnist George Monbiot and commissioned for the Labour Party. Thesummary of the paper,externaleven states: ""The following are proposals to the Labour Party, which will consider these as part of its policy development process in advance of the next general election."" To get to the Â£2,400 figure, the Conservatives have assumed Labour intends to spend Â£651bn on day-to-day spending (which comes from their original Â£1.2tn calculation) over five years. From there, the Conservatives say that Labour only plans to raise Â£277bn over the same period, leaving a shortfall of Â£374bn. So, if you then divide the shortfall by 31.2m UK taxpayers, you arrive at Â£2,400 a year each (or Â£12,000 per taxpayer over five years) to plug the gap. In summary, this analysis is based on assumptions about money Labour intends to spend but also how much revenue the party intends to raise. Until the manifestos are published, it is impossible to accurately identify any spending gaps. BBC political correspondent Chris Mason said the Conservatives' attack was part of a clear attempt to build an argument about what they call the ""cost of Corbyn"". But asked how much another Conservative government would cost taxpayers during a BBC interview, Chief Secretary to the Treasury Rishi Sunak did not provide a figure. ""The forecasts that there are from the OBR (Office for Budget Responsibility) show that there is a Â£30bn surplus on the current balance over the next few years - so we take in Â£30bn more than is spent on day-to-day spending,"" he told Radio 4's Today. ""We've said we will invest about Â£13.5bn of that on people's priorities like the NHS, like schools, like policing. We will not tax people extra for those day to day priorities."" Mr McDonnell said the Tories were unable to say how they would pay for their spending commitments. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

An earlier statement by the Carter Center said the former president was ""resting comfortably"" and his wife, Rosalynn, was with him. Mr Carter is the country's oldest living leader. The Democrat was the 39th president, serving one term from 1977 to 1981. He was defeated in his re-election bid by Ronald Reagan. Only one other president - George HW Bush - reached the age of 94. At 95-year-old Mr Carter is America's longest-lived president. Mr Carter, who left the White House in 1981, also has the distinction of being a former-US president longer than anyone else.

"From bare arms in the US House of Representatives to ties in the UK's House of Commons, what politicians wear to work can say a lot about the traditions they hold dear - and the ones they want to leave behind. Mark Zuckerberg made hoodies de rigueur in Silicon Valley. But can they catch on in the halls of Quebec's legislature? Quebec politician Catherine Dorion, who is a member of the left-wing Quebec Solidaire party, pushed the fashion envelope when she entered the provincial legislature wearing jeans and a hoodie sweatshirt last week. After several colleagues complained, Ms Dorion, who represents the district of Taschereau, decided to leave, because she ""didn't want to cause a scene"", said a spokesperson for her party.

Her sartorial stand has sparked a debate over appropriate attire for politicians, along with a hashtag, #moncotonouatÃ©monchoix (which translates to my hoodie, my choice). The National Assembly, Quebec's provincial legislature, has no official dress code, only the guidance that members' attire should ""contribute to the maintenance of decorum"". It is customary that during parliamentary proceedings, men wear a jacket and tie, and women a dress suit. Public servants are also banned from wearing religious symbols. But last February speaker FranÃ§ois Paradis was forced to address the issue after there were complaints about several members, mostly from Quebec Solidaire, wearing trainers, jeans and Doc Martens. He said the assembly should debate the issue, and come up with formal guidelines. Quebec passes religious symbols secularism bill Is it OK for public servants to wear religious symbols? ""Certainly, I do not think that it will be up to me, as president, to decide unilaterally. This is an issue which, following exchanges that we may have if necessary, will have to be decided collectively. I would strongly hope that a broad consensus emerges as is the case when we consider the possibility of reviewing our rules of procedure,"" he said. He urged members to wear ""city dress"" or business casual, until an official dress code could be decided on. Speaking on television programme Tout le Monde en Parle, Ms Dorian said she wears casual clothes to the assembly because she represents real people, not just the political class. ""The National Assembly is the house of the people, it is you, the world, who should be there, not all the same clique,"" she said. This was not the first time her outfits have been considered a faux pas. John Bercow: MPs don't need to wear ties US Congresswomen protest against dress code The 'right to bare arms' in Australia's parliament This Halloween, a few days before hoodiegate,  Ms Dorion posted a photo on social media of herself wearing a skirt-suit and sitting on top of a desk in the National Assembly, the joke being that she was ""in costume"" as an old-fashioned politician. In response, the Liberal Party filed a letter of complaint with the ethics commissioner, saying her Halloween costume was disrespectful. She said she was ""shocked and disappointed"" the party would lecture her. Many people have spoken in support of Ms Dorion, arguing that men are not scrutinised as closely for what they wear, and that the assembly should modernise. Some supporters even createda campaign to get women to wear a hoodie to work on Tuesday in solidarity,external. ""Women's bodies do not belong to you. Women's clothing choice does not belong to you,"" says the campaign's Facebook group. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

But others say sexism has nothing to do with it, and that a sweatshirt is just not acceptable office attire. ""A little common sense please! I'm open-minded but we still have to respect certain standards in life, even if we're ultra open,"" wrote one person on the Facebook group created to support Ms Dorion. In the age of business casual and office jeans, what counts as professional attire isn't always clear - even for politicians. Most of the debate has centred around women's attire, and whether bare arms are appropriate.

Men sometimes run afoul of dress codes too. In Montreal, a city councillor was kicked out of a meeting for not wearing a tie. Those rules were changed in 2018. Outgoing UK Speaker of the House John Bercow ruffled a few feathers when he said MPs did not need to wear ties.

"Auschwitz-Birkenau was the most notorious death camp built in Nazi-occupied Poland Poland's prime minister has written to streaming company Netflix insisting on changes to The Devil Next Door, a documentary about the Nazi death camps. Mateusz Morawiecki said a map shown in the series locates the death camps within modern-day Poland's borders. This misrepresents Poland as being responsible for the death camps, when it was actually occupied by Germany in World War Two, Mr Morawiecki said. Netflix told Reuters it was aware of concerns regarding the documentary. Nazi Germany invaded Poland in 1939, which marked the beginning of the war. New Holocaust law threatens 'whitewash' of Polish history Poland still counts losses from WW2 invasion The Germans built concentration camps including at Auschwitz, killing millions of people, most of them Jews. Mr Morawiecki said in his letter to Reed Hastings, the CEO of Netflix, that it was important to ""honour the memory and preserve the truth about World War II and the Holocaust"". He accused ""certain works"" on Netflix of being ""hugely inaccurate"" and ""rewriting history"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The prime minister attached a map of Europe in late 1942 to the letter, as well as an account by Witold Pilecki, who was voluntarily imprisoned in Auschwitz and wrote about his experiences after successfully escaping. ""I believe that this terrible mistake has been committed unintentionally,"" Mr Morawiecki added. Polish leader vows anti-Semitism fight Holocaust survivor meets baby he saved in WW2 Ritual beating of Judas effigy 'was anti-Semitic' Last year,Poland introduced lawscriminalising language implying Polish responsibility for the atrocities committed by Nazi Germany. However,an international outcry prompted the government to remove the threat of three-year jail terms. More than five million Poles were killed during World War Two, including up to three million Jews who were murdered in the Nazi Holocaust. The death camps were planned and operated by occupying German SS units. There were, however, some Polish atrocities against Jews and other civilians during and after the war. In 1941, Polish villagers in Jedwabne, perhaps at the instigation of the Nazis, rounded up more than 300 of their Jewish neighbours and burned them alive in a barn.

"This video can not be played ""It's like fireballs exploding in the air"": One town's mayor describes the Australia bushfires Raging bushfires have razed properties in Australia and briefly spread to suburbs of Sydney, officials say. Scores of fires are still burning in New South Wales amid temperatures of 35C (95F) and winds of 80km/h (50mph). A feared southerly wind change has now occurred but the ""catastrophic"" day feared has largely been avoided. No deaths were reported on Tuesday but fire chiefs warned that conditions meant the dangers facing the state were far from over. Firefighters who saved house leave milk 'apology' Is climate change to blame for Australia's fires? Early Australian bushfires 'an omen for summer' Have you been affected by the bushfires? Share your experiences by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. About six million people live in New South Wales (NSW) state. The number of fires still afflicting NSW ranged from 100 to 300 in Australian media reports. Crews have been battling a front spanning 1,000km (620 miles) along the north coast of NSW, with several blazes ""exceeding 100,000 hectares alone"", officials have said. Flame retardant had to be dropped in Sydney's northern suburbs as some bushfires approached within 15km (nine miles) of the city centre. Bushfires scorched parts of South Turramurra, an affluent suburb north of Sydney Earlier, residential areas of Sydney were doused in pink fire retardant A firefighting plane dropped pink fire retardant in the area between Macquarie University and the Sydney Adventist Hospital in the South Turramurra suburb. Flames came within metres of engulfing the homes of Blake Haymen and Sean Murphy in the affluent suburb. The residents were forced to use pool water to tackle a blaze that had spread from dense bushland across the road from their homes. ""We actually ran out of water pressure, so we had to go to the pool. Sean put out a spot-fire with one of these buckets,"" Mr Haymen told the Sydney Morning Herald. Authorities said one firefighter had suffered a broken arm and suspected fractured ribs. Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said: ""We've really got a long way to go. You can guarantee we're not going to be able to get around all of these fires before the next wave of bad weather. ""Unfortunately there's no meaningful reprieve. There's no rainfall in this change and we're going to continue to have warm dry conditions dominating in the days and weeks ahead."" Commissioner Fitzsimmons said up to a dozen homes were believed to have been damaged or destroyed on Tuesday. This video can not be played Matt Taylor looks at the causes behind Australia's bushfires People in vulnerable NSW communities have been urged to stay away from bushland. More than 600 schools are closed across the state. Australia's conservative government has refused to be drawn on whether climate change could have contributed to the fires, in a response that has drawn criticism. Three people have died and more than 170 properties have been destroyed since the fire emergency intensified in NSW on Friday.  .the highest point on Australia's six-point fire danger scale .results from high temperatures, strong winds and dry ground .fires starting under these conditions will threaten lives .homes cannot be defended from catastrophic fires .the only survival advice is to leave at risk areas early Authorities had said they were facing what could be ""the most dangerous bushfire week this nation has ever seen"". Mr Fitzsimmons said 3,000 firefighters were on the front lines, boosted by crews from other states and New Zealand, as well as the Australian Defence Force. Latest images of fires raging in New South Wales Final WRC round cancelled due to fires Experts have compared the situation to the 2009 Black Saturday bushfires in Victoria, when 173 people died. Police are investigating reports that a fire in North Rothbury, in the Hunter Region of NSW, and at least two others, may have been started deliberately. Locals try to put out ember-generated fires in New South Wales Fire authorities say a million hectares of land have burned in NSW since the fire season began in September. To the north, Queensland has also declared a state of emergency as 55 bushfires rage in the state. Though it was not facing such severe weather on Tuesday, officials warned conditions could deteriorate later in the week. Fire crews in South Australia were tacking about a dozen blazes, while bushfires in Western Australia also sparked emergency warnings. Scientists and experts warn that Australia's fire season has grown longer and more intense due to climate change. Officials have confirmed that 2018 and 2017 were Australia's third and fourth-hottest years on record respectively, and last yearthe nation experienced its warmest summer on record. The Bureau of Meteorology'sState of the Climate 2018 report said climate change had led to an increase in extreme heat events,externaland raised the severity of other natural disasters, such as drought. Climate emergency 'clear and unequivocal' Even if global temperatures are contained to a 2C rise above pre-industrial levels - a limit set out in the landmark Paris accord, agreed by 188 nations in 2015 -scientists believe the country is facing a dangerous new normal.

"Morales supporters clashed with police in La Paz Evo Morales has landed in Mexico where he has been offered asylum after resigning as president of Bolivia amid election fraud protests. In a tweet, he said it hurt to be leaving Bolivia but he would return with more ""strength and energy"". Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard said a Mexican government plane was sent for Mr Morales. Meanwhile, Bolivia's military commander ordered troops to back up police who have clashed with Morales supporters. Some 20 people were reported injured in the clashes. Mr Morales earlier urged his supporters to resist the ""dark powers"" that had forced him to step down. He also tweeted a photo of what he described as ""my first night after leaving the presidency forced out by the coup [organised by opposition leader Carlos] Mesa and [opposition activist Luis Fernando] Camacho with the help of the police"".

The deputy head of the Senate, Jeanine ÃÃ±ez, has said she will take over as interim president until new elections are held. Highs and lows of Evo Morales' presidency Why protesters are on the streets worldwide Mr Morales, a former coca farmer, was first elected in 2006. He has won plaudits for fighting poverty and improving Bolivia's economy but drew controversy by defying constitutional term limits to run for a fourth term in October's election, which is alleged to have been rife with irregularities. Up in El Alto, a city that sits high above La Paz in the Andes, life felt like it had stopped. The cable car that connects the two cities was paralysed, its cabins bobbing in the air in silence. And a normally bustling market place was deserted, stalls shut for fear of looting. Dania was one of the only shopkeepers willing to take a risk. She needs the money, she says. A supporter of Evo Morales, she says his resignation was nothing short of a coup.

Mexico has a left-leaning government and has supported Mr Morales. Evo Morales supporters fought running battles with police in La Paz on Monday Mr Ebrard earlier described events in Bolivia as a ""coup"", citing the military's involvement in Mr Morales' resignation. Pressure had been growing on Mr Morales since his narrow victory in last month's presidential election. On Sunday, events moved swiftly. First, the Organization of American States, a regional body, announced its audit of the election had found ""clear manipulation"" and called for the result to be annulled. In response, Mr Morales agreed to hold fresh elections. But his main rival, Carlos Mesa - who came second in the vote - said Mr Morales should not stand in any new vote. What really seemed to tip the balance was the intervention of the chief of the armed forces, Gen Williams Kaliman, who urged Mr Morales to step down in the interests of peace and stability. This video can not be played Watch Evo Morales announce his resignation Announcing his resignation, Mr Morales said he had taken the decision in order to stop fellow socialist leaders from being ""harassed, persecuted and threatened"". He also called his removal a ""coup"". Reports say Mr Morales made the announcement of his resignation from El Chapare, a coca-growing rural area of Cochabamba and a bastion of support for him and his Mas party. Opponents of Mr Morales have been celebrating across Bolivia, setting off fireworks and waving national flags, while his supporters clashed with police in the cities of La Paz and El Alto, according to local media reports.  13 years, 9 monthsin power 38 yearsleading the coca growers' union 54%of the votes won in 2005 election 64%of the votes won in 2009 election 61%of votes won in 2014 election Argentines and Bolivians also took to the streets of Buenos Aires on Monday to protest against his resignation. US President Donald Trump on Monday described the resignation as ""a significant moment for democracy in the Western Hemisphere"". The Russian foreign ministry said a ""wave of violence unleashed by the opposition"" had not allowed the ""presidential mandate of Evo Morales to be completed"". The Cuban president, Miguel DÃ­az Canel, tweeted that what happened was ""a violent and cowardly coup d'etat against democracy in Bolivia by the right"". Socialist-led countries Nicaragua and Venezuela also expressed solidarity with Mr Morales. Spain expressed its concern over the role of Bolivia's army, saying that ""this intervention takes us back to moments in the past history of Latin America"". Ms ÃÃ±ez's announcement that she would take over temporarily came after Vice-President Ãlvaro GarcÃ­a, Senate leader Adriana Salvatierra and House of Deputies' leader Victor Borda had all resigned, leaving her next in line.

"One villager said Fishlake ""has not been flooded for 100 years"" Residents of a heavily flooded village in Yorkshire fear conditions could get worse as more rain is forecast. The Environment Agency has 39 flood warnings in place across the country, including five severe warnings on the River Don in South Yorkshire. About 400 homes have been flooded in the North, and 1,200 properties have been evacuated, the agency said. Boris Johnson has called a meeting to discuss the government's response after criticism from Jeremy Corbyn. Doncaster Council has called for people to evacuate the village of Fishlake, near Doncaster, saying it ""can only offer dedicated support to people who are not in an area where there is a threat to life"". But farmers say they are unable to leave as they need to care for their livestock. Community rallies to help flood-hit villagers A yellow warning for rain remains in place over parts of Yorkshire and the East Midlands for Monday, Tuesday and Thursday. An emergency appeal to support ""displaced"" families has raised almost Â£50,000. Four Environment Agency pumps are now in operation in Fishlake to pump out floodwater from the village. Doncaster Council said it is ""still an emergency situation"" with five areas in the borough under a severe flood warning, meaning a ""significant risk to life"". The authority said the previous evacuation advice still stands for all areas. Twelve flood warnings remain in Lincolnshire where more than 1,000 acres have been flooded by Barlings Eau and some farms are cut off. This video can not be played A Lincolnshire farmer cut off by floodwater talks about his frustrations Jeremy Corbyn has written to Prime Minister Boris Johnson urging him to take greater action over the flooding and criticising him for not declaring a national emergency. ""If this had happened in Surrey, not Yorkshire or the East Midlands, it seems far more likely that a national emergency would have been declared,"" he said. The prime minister said he will chair an emergency Cobra meeting on Tuesday to discuss the government's response to the flooding. Pam Webb said she was devastated by the impact of the floods Pam Webb, who owns a spa in Fishlake, said she bought her property in 2004 and had surveys done at the time. ""There was nothing of any concern raised, Fishlake hadn't flooded in 100 years,"" she said. ""We need to now establish why and how and who should be accountable. ""Is it the flood defences that weren't sufficient to hold it? Did something give at some other point?"" A funeral parlour in Fishlake was hit by flooding Ms Webb said she had just found out her insurance would not cover the damage because of a flood exemption on the policy. ""It's my home and my business,"" she said. ""I work with a great team of girls and that's their livelihoods affected and my own as well."" The village church is collecting food to distribute to residents and roast dinners were delivered on Sunday to those who had remained in their homes. Empty coffins were seen floating inside the workshop of a flooded funeral parlour in the village. Farmer Robert Robinson called for the River Don to be dredged Tractors and boats have been used to get around the village, with many roadsin the area under floodwater. Military helicoptershave been used,externalto help boost flood defences in the area. The Environment Agency called in an RAF Chinook late on Sunday to move 40 tonnes of aggregate from a quarry to bolster drainage channels east of Bentley Farmer Robert Robinson said: ""My whole farm is just covered in water. We've animals that are suffering because of the water and we can't get in and out without tractors. ""We desperately need the River Don to be dredged and cleaned out, it's there to transport water and it's not doing its job properly."" Stephen Gilleard, another farmer from the village, said: ""You learn to live with nature and, as a farmer, you deal with things but you can't deal with this. ""There's a lot of volume of water here to move, we've still not got no pumps in place starting to get rid of any of it, it's a bad forecast for Thursday, more rain to come, and, unless we move some of this water, there's no room for any more."" Adrian Gill, a flood manager with the Environment Agency, said it did not currently dredge the River Don ""because we don't think that's the right thing to do"" but the situation could be reviewed in the future.

"An evacuation has been ordered in Fishlake, South Yorkshire Labour and the Lib Dems have criticised the government for its handling of severe flooding in northern England. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the government's response was ""woeful"" while Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson called for ""long-term policy changes"". Both have urged the prime minister to declare a ""national emergency"" over the floods. Boris Johnson is chairing a meeting of the government's emergency Cobra committee to discuss the situation. The Environment Agency has 30 flood warnings in place as well as five severe warnings on the River Don in South Yorkshire. About 500 homes have been flooded in Doncaster with more than 1,000 properties evacuated in areas hit by the floods. Firefighters have used boats to rescue residents in Fishlake An emergency appeal to support ""displaced"" families has raised more than Â£85,000. Doncaster flooding: Latest updates The Met Office has issuedyellow weather warnings for rain covering large parts of the countryon Tuesday and Thursday. It comes after downpours last week meant several areas were struck by a month's worth of rain in a single day. Hundreds of people in Fishlake, near Doncaster, have fled their homes after the village was submerged and the fire service said it was continuing to rescue people. The next door village of Stainforth has been coming to the aid of those evacuated from their homes. Fred Turner, 71, who has been helping at the community centre in the library, said he had been overwhelmed by the generosity of people. He said someone handed him Â£100 cash for the flood relief fund, and children sold sweets they had collected for Halloween to raise money for victims. ""Those with the least to give have been the kindest,"" he said. Volunteers have been gathering food for those forced to leave their homes He added that the villagers wanted the River Don to be dredged. ""It is a tidal river here, bringing in sand and silt from the Humber, and we have all the water coming off the hills around Sheffield,"" he said. ""At high tides it is coming the other way too and Fishlake is in the middle."" Community rallies to help flood-hit villagers In pictures: Rain floods parts of northern England How do you stop flooding? Speaking at a rally in Blackpool, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the Conservative government's response to the floods had ""been woeful"" and had only been triggered after he had written to Boris Johnson. Mr Corbyn said: ""If this had happened in Surrey instead of Yorkshire and the East Midlands, I think it would have been a very different story."" Jeremy Corbyn met flood victims in South Yorkshire on Saturday Number 10 disputed this, saying the decision to hold a Cobra meeting about the response to flooding had been taken prior to the letter from Mr Corbyn. The flooding situation at the weekend had not reached the level where a national emergency could be officially declared. Chancellor Sajid Javid said the government was ""very concerned"" about the flooding in northern England and ""the impact it's having on the people there"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson visited flood-hit Matlock on Friday Meanwhile, Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson arrived in Stainforth where sheset out plans for a Â£5bn fund to improve flood defencesacross the UK. She said: ""It is wrong that it seems to be just down to the local communities, important though this work is; this is clearly a national emergency and the government should be declaring it as such."" Jo Swinson has called for ""long-term policy changes"" over flooding National Farmers Union (NFU) president Minette Batters said ""seismic change"" was needed to tackle flooding. She said the current situation was an ""absolute disaster"" for farmers and called for a ""reform on how we manage water"", adding that it was a ""wake-up call"" for all politicians. By Dominic Casciani, BBC Home Affairs Correspondent The key legislation that deals with this kind of event does not refer to a ""national emergency"" as such, but only an ""emergency"" - which is an event that threatens ""serious damage to human welfare"", the environment, or is a major attack, such as war or a huge act of terrorism. TheCivil Contingencies Act 2004,externalforces public bodies to prepare for such worst-case scenarios. In the case of the current floods, the Environment Agency, local councils and others are expected to have planned properly and to swing into action. If an emergency is somehow overwhelming, ministers can use the Act to take control and even override existing laws and rules. One of the catalysts for the legislation was a national fuel shortage in 2000 as protesters blockaded refineries over petrol pump prices. Were that to happen today, a prime minister could in theory order the Army to commandeer fuel tankers and keep the nation moving. The Cobra meeting is Whitehall's way of trying to efficiently bring together all the key people in an emergency to co-ordinate the government's response. Four Environment Agency pumps are in Fishlake to remove floodwater from the village. Joe Howslam, 23, told the BBC: ""I live with my parents, brother and sister, but we've all had to move out. ""In the history of Fishlake it's never been this bad, according to some of the older members of our village."" Pam Webb, who owns a spa in Fishlake, described how she lost everything she has worked for after her insurance did not cover flooding. ""I feel really selfish in saying this and I hope that other people aren't in this boat, but I've lost my home and my business and my livelihood that I've worked so hard for."" Many parts of Fishlake remain under 3ft (1m) of water Tractors and boats have been used to get around the village, with many roadsin the area under floodwater. According to the Salvation Army, some people have been rescued from their homes by boat since the early hours of Saturday, but others remain in their properties, while military helicoptershave been used,externalto help boost flood defences in the area.

"Chinese firm Jingye says will invest Â£1.2bn in British Steel as it signed a deal to rescue the UK steelmaker. It also said it would seek to ""preserve thousands of jobs in a key foundation industry for the UK"" but did not put a number on how many would be saved. British Steel employs about 4,000 people in Scunthorpe and Teesside. It has been kept running by the government via the Official Receiver since May, when the company went into liquidation. Jingye said it anticipated making job offers ""to as many employees across the business as possible"". Group chairman Li Ganpo said it would spend Â£1.2bn over the next decade in upgrading plant and machinery, ""improving the company's environmental performance... and boosting energy efficiency to place the operations on a more competitive and sustainable footing"". It also said it would aim to identify new markets and products. Business Minister Andrea Leadsom said she had met with Jingye's chairman on Monday. ""I have been given reassurances that next to all current staff will be kept and that in the medium to longer term they are likely to want to expand the workforce"" she said. The deal will give the Chinese company control of a third of the UK's steel industry. But Ms Leadsom said: ""There aren't any national security issues with this acquisition. ""In my dealings with Jingye, I think they will show themselves to be very committed to continued and expanded production [here] in Scunthorpe and on Teesside."" Jingye will acquire the steelworks at Scunthorpe, UK steel mills and shares of FN Steel BV, British Steel France Rail SAS and TSP Engineering.  The sale also includes the shares owned by BSL in Redcar Bulk Terminal. A statement from the Official Receiver said: ""Completion of the contract is conditional on a number of matters, including gaining the necessary regulatory approvals. The parties are working together to conclude a sale as soon as reasonably practicable. ""The business will continue to trade as normal during the period between exchange and completion. Support from employees, suppliers and customers since the liquidation has been a critical factor in achieving this outcome."" One worker at British Steel in Scunthorpe told the BBC: ""It has been a big concern, nobody knew what was happening... whether they had a job, could pay the mortgages, feed the families. It is great news."" Gareth Stace, director general of industry lobby group UK Steel, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the business being bought was a ""significant asset to our country"". He said that there was a need for ""very significant investment"" in the Scunthorpe works and that was why the deal with Jingye was ""really welcome"". This video can not be played British Steel is Scunthorpe's biggest employer British Steel had previously been in rescue talks with Ataer, a subsidiary of Turkey's state military retirement scheme Oyak. Ataer said its own talks failed ""mainly due to lack of support from the key stakeholders"". What does a steel maker from Hebei province, south-west of Beijing, see in a struggling plant in Scunthorpe?  It is difficult to know, particularly when we know so little about Jingye. There is little publicly available information - certainly no set of accounts - but the organisation's Facebook page extols its rapid rise to become a big player in steel in just 20 years. On the face of it, the Chinese buyer will be interested in the products that British Steel makes that it does not. British Steel is a specialist in railway tracks, ""long  products"", a catch-all term for girders used in construction, and the high-quality steel wire used in car tyres and dozens of other industrial applications. Jingye does not appear to make the first two, so British Steel should bring it some valuable technology and new product lines. This has to be set against the need for investment at Scunthorpe. What British Steel workers will fervently hope is that the Jingye commitment is long-term and that this is not another false dawn. Mr Stace said he believed the steel industry in the UK could now compete globally and he was publishing a manifesto with ideas for change. ""But the problem we have is we have an uncompetitive business landscape in the UK. Government can change that,"" he added. ""I'm talking about energy costs, business rates, procurement - the government buying more steel from the UK - free and fair trade, and even much more support for R&D [research and development], which we are going to lose when we fall out of the EU."" He said: ""What government needs to do is give us that business landscape. We can thrive on the global market and generate highly paid, highly skilled jobs for the UK economy."" In the long term, it is believed that while Jingye Group has promised to increase production, it has also warned costs may need to be cut. Ross Murdoch, national officer for the GMB union, said: ""We were impressed with the passion and enthusiasm from the Jingye team. ""However, due diligence on this sale was completed very quickly and the devil will be in the detail."" British Steel: 'We fear for our town's future' Chinese group 'is favourite to buy British Steel' Community, a UK trade union which absorbed the old Iron & Steel Trades Confederation body, said it welcomed ""this positive step towards securing British Steel under new ownership"". ""The fact that there has been ongoing interest from both Ataer and now Jingye rightly demonstrates that potential buyers believe that British Steel can have a sustainable future."" The UK industry has been struggling for a number of years amid claims that China has been flooding the market with cheap steel. In 2016 the EU imposed tariffs of up to 73.7% on Chinese steel after an influx of cheap imports from Asia forced European manufacturers to cut jobs and lower prices. Jingye has 23,500 employees and as well as its main steel and iron making businesses, italso engages in tourism, hotels and real estate.,external It has total registered assets of 39bn yuan (Â£4.4bn). According to its website, Jingye Group ranked 217th among the top 500 enterprises in China in 2019. The firm sells its products nationwide and exports them to more than 80 countries and regions.

"This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""Labourâs 'national education service' will offer people free education as a right for all."" Labour is promising a Â£3bn plan to offer adults in England free access to retraining to help their job chances and to tackle skills shortages. Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner wants to ""throw open the door"" to adults wanting to learn new skills. The Lib Dems are promising a Â£10,000 training grant for each adult, which it calls a ""skills wallet"". The Conservatives have a National Retraining Scheme for adults needing to update their skills for work. With concerns about automation threatening jobs and warnings from employers about a lack of skilled staff, the political parties are setting out their stalls for adult education and retraining. The CBI business group welcomed making training a priority, saying: ""Adult participation in education is at its lowest for two decades."" The Edge vocational education charity warned the current skills shortage was costing UK businesses Â£4.4bn per year. Live: Latest election news On Tuesday, Labour's election campaign set out plans to spend an extra Â£3bn per year to provide free access to vocational learning for adults - which it hopes will reach an extra 300,000 people per year. Angela Rayner and Jeremy Corbyn will promise more support for training for jobs Ms Rayner says it will help people ""who want to change career, are made redundant or didn't get the qualifications they needed when they were younger"". ""For many, adult education is too expensive, too time-consuming or too difficult to get into,"" she says. Labour would offer adults up to six years of training, such as for vocational qualifications in the healthcare and engineering sectors or adults wanting to go back to college to get academic qualifications. Employees would also have a right to paid time off for education and training and there are promises to improve careers advice for adults. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Ms Rayner said she wanted to ""change the culture"" so that ""learning is part of everyday life, rather than something that is done to you at a particular point"". It was a ""long overdue investment"", she said, improving the skills of young people and adults, rather relying on skilled workers from abroad. The shadow education secretary said access to adult education would be open to all and would be ""free at the point of use"" without means testing, with funding to come from changes to taxes for high earners and businesses. Ms Rayner also restated Labour's commitment to scrapping tuition fees for university students in England. ""We will abolish tuition fees, no ifs, no buts."" She rejected concerns from vice chancellors about whether university funding would be protected, accusing them of receiving ""wild amounts"" of pay, and saying they were paid much more than the prime minister. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn says education should be ""like an escalator running alongside you throughout life, that you can get on and off whenever you want"". The Liberal Democrats have put forward their plans for adult education - based on the idea of individuals having a ""skills wallet"" to pay for training, with government funding being available to be drawn down at different stages of life. At the age of 25, there would be Â£4,000 put into the skills wallet, Â£3,000 at the age of 40 and then Â£3,000 at the age of 55. The Lib Dems say the policy will cost Â£1.6bn per year by 2024-25. Lib Dems propose Â£10,000 'skills wallet' Labour warns of 'catastrophic' fall in adult learners National Retraining Scheme for workers who lose jobs to automation 'I left school with no exams, but that didn't mean I was thick' ""In an ever changing workplace, people often need to develop new skills but the cost of courses and qualifications shuts too many people out,"" Lib Dem business spokesman Sam Gyimah says. Sam Gyimah, of the Lib Dems, has promised adults individual funding for their learning needs The Conservatives in government have begun to test plans for a National Retraining Scheme, supported by Â£100m announced in last year's Budget. This is intended to help people train for changing jobs and alternative careers if their jobs are threatened by automation. There are some local pilot tests for the retraining scheme, available to adults without degrees in low-income jobs. It is scheduled to be rolled out more widely in 2020. The Conservatives also highlighted their plans for new vocational qualifications, called T-levels. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said Labour was ""making promises that it simply won't be able to fulfil"". But Jo Grady, leader of the UCU lecturers' union, warned of ""steep falls"" in numbers of adult students. ""For too many years, adult learning has been a sorely neglected part of our education system,"" she said. Gavin Williamson says Labour is making promises they ""won't be able to fulfil"" Neil Bates, who chairs the Edge vocational educational charity, said employers would want to tackle the Â£4.4bn cost of skills shortages - and individuals needed to have the skills for ""secure, well paid, sustainable jobs"". The chief executive of the Learning and Work Institute, Stephen Evans, who was a member of Labour's Lifelong Learning Commission, warned that currently ""the number of adults taking part in learning at its lowest levels on record"". ""Worse still, it is the adults who could most benefit from access to training opportunities who are least likely to participate,"" he said. Employers have complained of skills shortages and Matthew Fell, the CBI's chief policy director, said it was important ""lifelong learning is rising to the top of the political agenda"". He said businesses would also welcome support for technical education and giving it a status ""on par with academic learning"". All the parties know their record on adult education is pretty poor, writes Sophie Hutchinson. According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, in the past 15 years, overall spending on classroom-based courses has fallen by two-thirds, as have the number of adult learners. The adult education budget fell by 32% between 2003-04 and 2009-10 under Labour and by a further 47% from 2009-10 to 2018-19 under the coalition and the Conservatives. Labour now says it would reverse that and more, coming close to doubling the current adult education budget, taking it back to levels similar to 2003. The Lib Dems also want a boost to lifelong learning - with a ""skills wallet"" for money for adults to spend on learning. But there will be a challenge ensuring this is spent on genuine courses - as a previous Individual Learning Account scheme faced widespread fraud. Lib Dems propose Â£10k 'skills wallet' Fall in adult learners 'catastrophic' says Labour UK workers who lose jobs to AI will be retrained 'No exams but I knew I wasn't thick' Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser LA mayor says winds and drought created 'perfect storm', while officials hit out at looters Biden praises Carter's character as former president's coffin heads to Georgia Henry Zeffman: Market trouble threatens Labour's economic plans The '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty.

"This video can not be played Farage: ""The Brexit Party will not contest 317 seats"" Nigel Farage has ditched plans to take on the Tories in more than 300 seats, after what he said was Boris Johnson's ""shift of position"" on Brexit. The Brexit Party leader had planned to run candidates in 600 seats after Mr Johnson rejected his offer of a ""Leave alliance"" to deliver Brexit. But he has been under pressure not to split the pro-Brexit vote. The party will not now stand in 317 seats won by the Tories in 2017, but will continue to stand elsewhere. Mr Farage said his party would focus its efforts on trying to take seats held by Labour, whom he accused of ""betraying"" its Leave-supporting voters. LIVE: Farage 'giving Johnson half a chance' Lib Dems, Greens and Plaid agree election pact What is tactical voting? The BBC's Alex Forsyth said some Brexit Party candidates had expressed concern about Mr Farage's plan to stand against the Tories in 600 constituencies, fearing it could hand an election victory to Labour and lead to another EU referendum. The Brexit Party is less than a year old and does not have any MPs - but it was the clear winner in the UK'sEuropean elections in May, with more than 30% of the vote. Mr Johnson welcomed Mr Farage's move, calling it ""a recognition that there's only one way to get Brexit done, and that's to vote for the Conservatives"". Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Donald Trump ""got his wish"" when Mr Farage announced his electoral strategy. He said the Brexit Party leader was offering a ""Trump alliance"" that would lead to ""Thatcherism on steroids"" and threaten the future of the NHS. The US president hadpreviously urgedMr Farage to team up with Boris Johnson, saying they would be ""an unstoppable force"". Liberal Democrat deputy leader Sir Ed Davey said Mr Farage's decision ""shows the Conservatives and the Brexit Party are now one and the same"". Mr Farage made the announcement in Labour-held Hartlepool - a top target for his party Explaining his U-turn to supporters in Hartlepool, Mr Farage said Boris Johnson had recently signalled a ""big shift of position"" in his approach to Brexit. He cited a pledge by the PM not to extend thetransition periodthat would follow the UK's departure from the EU under the terms of his Brexit deal. The period would see the UK stick to the EU rules on issues such as freedom of movement until December 2020. Mr Farage also said he was encouraged by recent commitments from Mr Johnson to seek further divergence from EU rules in a post-Brexit trade deal. He added that this was a ""huge change"" from the kind of trade pact that had been planned under former PM Theresa May. Mr Farage's decision prompted dismay among some Brexit Party candidates who had been hoping to stand in Tory-held seats next month. Neil Greaves, who had been due to stand for the party in the Essex seat of Harlow, told the PA news agency that Mr Farage had ""let Brexiteers down"". He said he planned to continue to stand in the constituency as an independent pro-Brexit candidate, and urged fellow former candidates to do the same. The party's candidate in Mansfieldtweeted,externalthat the move meant the ""opportunity to stand up for democracy"" had been ""snatched away"" from candidates. Why candidates stand down to help other parties Poll tracker: How do the parties compare? Election translator: What does it all mean? Mr Farage had previously offered to not stand candidates against the Tories in certain seats if the prime minister changed aspects of his Brexit deal. But the proposal was rejected by Boris Johnson, who said deals with ""any other party"" would ""risk putting Jeremy Corbyn into No 10"". Mr Farage said he had ""genuinely tried"" to forge a so-called ""Leave alliance"" with the Tories, but his efforts had gone nowhere. ""In a sense we now have a Leave alliance, it's just that we've done it unilaterally,"" he added. Mr Farage has already confirmed he willnot be standing himselfin the election, saying he wanted to concentrate on helping his party's candidates. Hypothetically, the decision by the Brexit Party leader makes it notionally easier for the Tories to keep seats they hold already. But it's a million miles away from giving them a clear run. Mr Farage says he will still stand candidates in Labour areas. And for the prime minister to get the majority he craves, the Tories have to take seats that are currently held by Labour, not just hold on their existing MPs. Read more from Laura. Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon said the Conservatives have ""effectively become the Brexit Party"". She added that defeating the Tories in Scotland ""will help deprive Boris Johnson's increasingly extreme and right-wing party of the majority they crave"". Anti-Brexit parties Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats have agreednot to stand against each otherin 60 seats across England and Wales. Their pact means that, in Wales, two of the parties will agree not to field a candidate, boosting the third candidate's chances of picking up the Remain vote. In England, it will simply be a two-way agreement between the Lib Dems and the Greens.

"Sir Roderick Evans became standards commissioner in 2017 The man who oversees complaints about politicians in Wales has resigned after he was secretly recorded by an assembly member. Standards commissioner Sir Roderick Evans said ""highly confidential conversations"" with his staff had been taped. The former Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy has confirmed he made the recordings. Police are being asked to investigate and the assembly has arranged a sweep of the organisation's estate. The South Wales Central AM, who now sits as an independent, alleged he had found evidence that he claimed had brought Sir Roderick's office into disrepute. He said he had acted lawfully and in the public interest. He had been facing three separate investigations by the standards commissioner at the time, before Sir Roderick resigned. Sir Roderick, a former high court judge and pro-chancellor of Swansea University, said Mr McEvoy's actions were ""wholly unacceptable"" as he stood down on Monday.

""These have included highly confidential conversations with my staff including references to cases brought by members of the public.
