"""Oxygen, oxygen, can you get me oxygen?"" I wake up this morning to an anguished phone call from a school teacher, whose 46-year-old husband has been battling Covid-19 in an oxygen-starved Delhi hospital. Here we go again, I tell myself. Just another day of life in a city where breathing has become a luxury for so many. We work the phone, send SOS calls. Amid the sounds of beeping monitors, the woman tells us that her husband's oxygen saturation number has dipped to a precariously low 58. A bit later it rises to 62. You are supposed to consult your doctor if the number sinks to 92 or lower. She tells us she is happy it has gone up. And her husband is still talking and aware. I text a doctor friend working in critical care. ""Patients remain talkative even when the number hits 40,"" she messages me. I pick up the newspaper. Twenty five critically ill patients have died in a well-known private hospital. The oxygen pressure had been dialled down in critical care and many patients were being given oxygen manually, the hospital said. There's a photograph of two men and a woman sharing a cylinder on the front page. Three strangers -  caught up in a tragedy brought upon by public laxity and government negligence - sharing a lifeline. The 40-year-old son of one of the men, a report says, died outside the same hospital a few days ago, waiting for a bed. He had found a stretcher though, the report helpfully said. That's what grieving Indians are grateful for now: if you can't provide beds or medicines or oxygen to save my loved one, at least give them a gurney to rest their corpses. As the day progresses, I realise nothing has changed. Patients are dying because there's no oxygen. Medicines are still scarce and on the black market. There's hoarding and panic buying as if we are in a war. In many ways, we are. The teacher calls again. The hospital doesn't even have a spare oxygen flow meter, so she has to get one. We work the phones, send out Twitter appeals. Someone manages to pick up a device, which is used for regulating supply from the cylinder to the patient. Despite what the government says, things are going from bad to worse. Oxygen tankers are not making it in time to the city to save patients. There are no beds, few medicines. Even India's privileged have no privilege left: a magazine editor called me in the afternoon, looking for an oxygen cylinder for a sick patient, whom he knows. In the apartment building where I live, residents are trying to buy some oxygen concentrators in case someone ""needs help with breathing"". Fifty seven residents are infected and isolated in their homes. Patients have been left to fend for themselves. For many it's a slow and gradual road to death. Covid-19 is a disease with too many ambushes. ""Even if I'm dying, until I actually die, I am still living,"" Paul Kalanithi, a neurosurgeon, wrote in his piercing memoir, When Breath Becomes Air. There are only small mercies for the gasping victims of a deadly virus in India today. Several flights and trains have been delayed as visibility reached zero in many areas. India’s six losses in eight Tests raise doubts over Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, and their red-ball future.

"This video can not be played The BBC's Yogita Limaye reports from a hospital in Delhi, which is running low on beds and oxygen Indian hospitals say their patients are dying because of a shortage of oxygen as Covid case numbers and deaths set new records for a third day running. India has recorded nearly a million infections in three days, with 346,786 new cases overnight into Saturday. At the Jaipur Golden Hospital in Delhi, 20 people died overnight because of a lack of oxygen, an official said. The government says it is deploying trains and the air force to transport supplies to hard-hit areas. The number of deaths across India rose by 2,624 in the 24 hours to Saturday, up from 2,263 on Friday. The World Health Organization (WHO) said the situation in India was a ""devastating reminder"" of what the coronavirus could do. Deaths climb as India reels from deadly Covid wave A city where 'breathing has become a luxury' Why India is running out of oxygen again Earlier this year, the Indian government believed it had beaten the virus. New cases fell to 11,000 by mid-February, vaccines were being exported, and in March the health minister said India was ""in the endgame"" of the pandemic. However, since then, a new surge has erupted, driven by the emergence of new variants, as well as mass gatherings, such as the Kumbh Mela festival, where millions of pilgrims gathered earlier this month. Hospitals in Delhi have warned they are at breaking point. At the Holy Family Hospital, intensive care units are full and there is no room for any more beds. ""Almost every hospital is on the edge. If oxygen runs out, there is no leeway for many patients,"" Dr Sumit Ray told the BBC. ""Within minutes, they will die. You can see these patients: they're on ventilators, they require high-flow oxygen. If the oxygen stops, most of them will die."" Have India's rallies helped spread coronavirus? Why second Covid wave is devastating India At the Jaipur Golden Hospital, a doctor told the BBC the government had allocated 3.6 tonnes of oxygen, to be delivered by 17:00 on Friday. However, the supply - a fraction of what was promised - only arrived at midnight, he told the BBC. On Friday, Delhi's Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal pleaded for oxygen supplies on live TV, Reuters news agency reported. ""All of the country's oxygen plants should immediately be taken over by the government through the army,"" he said. ""Oxygen, oxygen, can you get me oxygen?"" I wake up this morning to an anguished phone call from a school teacher, whose husband was been battling for his life in a Delhi hospital. I tell myself: another day of life in a city where breathing has become a luxury for so many.  We work the phone, send SOS calls. I text a doctor friend working in critical care.

Read more from Soutik A virologist at the Christian Medical College in the city of Vellore in southern India, Gagandeep Kang, told the BBC more action was needed to stop the spread of the virus. ""We need to ensure that there are no non-essential activities taking place. You know what Indian weddings are like, and restricting the size of gatherings, whether it is for family reasons, other social reasons or for business or for political rallies. All of that really needs to stop,"" she told the BBC. ""I don't think a national lockdown is required, but I think that in places that are showing a rise in cases, we do need to intervene with greater stringency than we have done in the past.""

"Turkey said it would ban the use of cryptocurrencies to pay for goods and services from 30 April Turkish authorities say four people linked to the cryptocurrency platform Vebitcoin have been arrested, accused of fraud. Hours earlier, the company abruptly announced it had ceased operations, citing financial strains. Officials also launched an investigation and blocked the accounts of the platform. Earlier this week, a second Turkish platform, Thodex, shut down holding investments from about 390,000 users. Increasing numbers of people are opting to use cryptocurrencies in Turkey in an attempt to protect their savings from a sharp decline in the value of the local currency, the lira. But the Turkish cryptocurrency market is unregulated. Last week, Turkey said it would ban the use of cryptocurrencies to pay for goods and services from 30 April. Turkey launches international hunt for crypto boss Bitcoin: From buying a Bentley to losing it all Mehmet Nadir Yagci, a prosecutor in the south-western city of Mugla, said the four arrested were administrators and personnel of the platform. On Friday, Vebitcoin announced on its website it had stopped all activities ""in order to fulfil all regulations and claims"". It was not immediately clear how many people had been affected. ""Due to the recent developments in the crypto money industry, there was a much higher density in our operations than expected. We would like to state with regret that this situation has led us to a very difficult process,"" it said. Meanwhile, Turkey has issued an international arrest warrant for the Thodex founder, Faruk Fatih Ozer, who reportedly fled to Albania with an alleged $2bn (Â£1.4bn) from investors. Police also arrested 62 people over alleged connections to Thodex. Mr Ozer called the allegations against him ""baseless"" and said he was in Albania for work meetings. On Wednesday, Thodex posted a message saying it needed five days to handle an unspecified outside investment before it suspended trading. An investigation into the platform has been launched.

"This video can not be played The increase in demand for semiconductors during the pandemic surprised many, Mr Robbins says The boss of networking giant Cisco has said the shortage of computer chips is set to last for most of this year. Many firms have seen production delayed because of a lack of semiconductors, triggered by the Covid pandemic and exacerbated by other factors. Cisco chief Chuck Robbins told the BBC: ""We think we've got another six months to get through the short term. ""The providers are building out more capacity. And that'll get better and better over the next 12 to 18 months."" That expansion of capacity will be crucial as advances in technology - including 5G, cloud computing, the internet of things and artificial intelligence - drive a big increase in demand. Semiconductors power many consumer goods Mr Robbins is the latest tech boss to weigh in on the debate - and with 85% of internet traffic using Cisco's systems, his opinion matters. ""Right now, it is a big problem,"" he says, ""because semiconductors go in virtually everything."" The seemingly insatiable demand is why major US manufacturer Intel announced a $20bn (Â£14.5bn) plan to significantly expand production, including two new plants in Arizona. Jaguar Land Rover halts output over chip shortage Chip shortage: Samsung warns of 'serious imbalance' How will 'chipageddon' affect you? According to Dan Ives, a tech analyst at investment firm Wedbush Securities, current ""demand is probably 25% higher than anyone would have expected"". Even though the shortage ""is going to be an issue for the next three to six months"", technology share prices are doing well because investors are focused on the growing long-term demand for their products. President Biden and his advisers held a virtual meeting to discuss the chip shortage with business leaders US President Joe Biden also sees this as a long-term issue and used a White House summit with business leaders this month to urge them to make the country a world leader in computer chips. Amid the trade and technology war with China, the White House says it is ""a top and immediate priority"". The US-based Semiconductor Industry Association says 75% of global manufacturing capacity is in East Asia. Taiwan's TSMC and South Korea's Samsung are the dominant players. European politicians also want more chips made locally, a view partly driven by concerns over China's desire to achieve reunification with Taiwan. Meanwhile, China has seen a huge growth in domestic demand for chips to power new technology, but has only a small share of global manufacturing capacity. Mr Robbins says: ""I think that it doesn't necessarily matter where they're made, as long as you have multiple sources."" However, Intel chief executive Pat Gelsingertold the BBC it was not ""palatable""to have so many chips made in Asia. Data centres, such as this one full of Cisco equipment, are helping drive demand for semiconductors TSMC appears intent on holding on to its position as the world's biggest contract manufacturer and isspending $100bn to expand capacityover the next three years. This week its founder, Morris Chang, called on the Taiwanese government to ""keep hold of it tightly,external"", arguing it is better positioned to make chips than the US or China, despite their big government subsidies. TSMC founder Morris Chang, seen here in November, wants Taiwan's government to protect its chip industry The chip shortage was heightened by the coronavirus pandemic. At first, many companies cut their orders for chips, thinking demand would fall, which led suppliers to reduce capacity. However, demand for consumer electronics rose during the pandemic. The problems have been worsened by a string of other factors, including a fire at a semiconductor factory and weather issues. This, combined with a ""generational technological change has created an unprecedented situation for the industry"", according to Paul Triolo, who leads the geo-technology practice at consultancy Eurasia Group. Factory blaze adds to computer chip supply crisis Texas freeze shuts chip factories amid shortages Drought hits Taiwan chip supply as US wants more He thinks it doesn't matter where chips are made as long as there is a diversity of supply. However, the shortages are likely ""to persist for some time"" and longer-term solutions are needed to address the concentration of manufacturing of semiconductors, which is a ""problem that predates the shortage"". That is why Mr Robbins says: ""What we don't want is to have consolidation where any of the risks that we may face could, frankly, result in the situation we're seeing today, whether it's weather-related disaster risks, whether it's single point of failure risk, whether its geopolitical risks, whatever those are. We just need more options, I think, for where semiconductors are built."" Water trucks arrive at a TSMC factory in Taiwan to help address the water shortage which is causing production problems Cisco recently completed the $4.5bn acquisition of Acacia Communications, which, among other things, designs computer chips. Mr Robbins ruled out Cisco using it as an opportunity to start making its own chips. ""We're not a semiconductor fab company, so it's not a core competency for us to do that. So we think that companies that play in this space are much better equipped, we're working very closely with them."" The huge cost of chip manufacturing facilities means they operate at near full capacity and so it will take time to meet the increased demand. The size of that demand ""is not clear"", according to Mr Triolo. He says that, like other major technology vendors, ""Cisco's equipment relies heavily on reliable supply chains for a range of semiconductors."" The shortages, he says, have been ""exacerbated by companies over ordering components to build up inventory, afraid of being caught short again"".

"Florentino Perez says the ESL was created ""to save football"" Real Madrid president Florentino Perez says the 12 clubs that agreed to join a new European Super League have ""binding contracts"" and ""cannot leave"". Nine of the 12 teams, including all six Premier League clubs, withdrew from the proposed tournament on Tuesday after the plan sparked a furious backlash. Real Madrid, Barcelona and Juventus have not yet abandoned the project. ""I don't need to explain what a binding contract is, but effectively the clubs cannot leave,""Perez told newspaper AS,external. ""Some of them, due to pressure, have said they're leaving.

"The man allegedly pulled his mask down and coughed on colleagues (stock image) A man has been arrested in Spain on suspicion of assault after allegedly infecting 22 people with Covid. The 40-year-old is alleged to have continued to go to work and the gym despite having a cough and a temperature of more than 40C (104F). He is said to have walked around his place of work in Majorca, pulling his mask down, coughing and telling colleagues he was going to infect them. Five colleagues and three fellow gym goers later tested positive. Another 14 people - family members of the infected - also came down with Covid, including three one-year-olds. What Europeans have learned from a year of pandemic Man jailed for spitting at PC who caught Covid Third of police officers 'threatened with deliberate infection' In a statement released on Saturday, Spanish police said the man had been exhibiting symptoms for a number of days, but refused to go home from work in the town of Manacor. He took a PCR test one evening, but then went to work and the gym the next day while awaiting the results. His colleagues told him to go home, but he refused, police said. He would then pull down his mask, cough and say: ""I'm going to infect you all with coronavirus."" When his test came back positive, colleagues were ""alarmed"", according to police, who have been investigating the allegations since late January.

"Ismaila Sarr (far left) netted his 13th goal of the season from the penalty spot Watford sealed automatic promotion back to the Premier League at the first attempt after a narrow home win over Millwall. Ismaila Sarr's composed 11th-minute penalty, after the Senegal winger was brought down in the box by Billy Mitchell, proved enough for the Hornets. Mitchell drew a save from home keeper Daniel Bachmann before the break with a shot from outside the box before Mason Bennett saw his follow-up effort clip the top of the bar. Bachmann clawed away a close-range effort from a corner as Millwall pressed for an equaliser in the second half, but Watford held on to secure an eighth successive league victory at Vicarage Road. Relive Saturday's EFL action Watford have followed Norwich City in securing an instant return to the to flight after relegation last season, and their impressive home form has been the cornerstone of their promotion bid. Xisco Munoz's side are on their best run at at Vicarage Road since 1977 - and registered a club-record 18th home triumph of the campaign. Sarr made no mistake from the spot, stroking the ball down the middle as Lions keeper Bartosz Bialkowski dived to his left. Dan Gosling could have made it 2-0 with a header from Tom Cleverley's free-kick before the Watford goal came under threat, but a 22nd clean sheet of the season secured all three points and prompted celebrations at full-time. Watford defender Adam Masina cracked open the champagne at Vicarage Road While stability was the cornerstone of Norwich's success this season, Watford have gone about things in a typically frantic manner. Hayden Mullins had seen them through to the end of last season in an interim capacity after the dismissal of Nigel Pearson, and Vladimir Ivic was appointed in August to lead the club's recovery in the Championship. Abdoulaye Doucoure, Gerard Deulofeu and Roberto Pereyra were among the big names to leave Vicarage Road, though highly sought-after forward Sarr and captain Troy Deeney remained. But Ivic's reign lasted just four months and 20 league games, despite the Hornets being fifth in the table and just four points from the top two. A falling out with striker Deeney seemed to seal the Serbian's fate andMunoz replaced him the following dayto become the Watford's fifth manager in just over a year. The 40-year-old Spaniard turned previously frequent draws into victories and an already solid defence became even tougher to breach, with Bachmann becoming first-choice keeper and Francisco Sierralta, William Troost-Ekong and Kiko Femenia all dependable across the back. Watford have gone from being functional and somewhat uninspiring in the first half of the campaign to showing a real attacking verve - talisman Sarr, Brazilian teenager Joao Pedro and Sweden winger Ken Sema forming a skilful three-pronged attack - with the 6-0 demolition of Bristol City in February a particular high point. How they will fare back in the Premier League next season is anyone's guess but the chop and change approach of owner Gino Pozzo has once again paid dividends. Spaniard Xisco Munoz joined Watford in December from Georgian outfit Dinamo Tbilisi Watford head coach Xisco Munoz told BBC Three Counties Radio: ""It is an amazing moment, and it is the moment to say thank you to everyone who has helped me and the players. ""It was a very good performance and we are at a very good level. ""I will always say I have been very lucky with the players from the first day. ""Everyone worked with the same idea and passion, and it is very nice when you have a group where everyone has the same direction. Everyone at the training ground believed. ""Right now it is important to enjoy the situation and after we will prepare for next season."" Millwall boss Gary Rowett: ""We gave a silly penalty away. Billy has got to learn not to be so rash, but he is a terrific young player with a bright future. ""For about 15 minutes after that it looked as though we felt a bit sorry for ourselves, but we worked hard to try to get back into the game. ""After the first 20 minutes I thought we were excellent and we were probably the better side from thereon. ""Just that little bit of quality was missing. I don't think we could have done much more than we did. ""Good luck to Watford - they have got Premier League quality players and deserve to go up.""

The four were celebrating finishing a 10km run with a cup of coffee in the park's Cafe Castan. Elen, from Llandaff, said: ""I run with a group of friends and have been for a number of years and we have not been able to run together. ""The four of us met up today for the first time and we're celebrating with a 10km run with a cuppa."" The 48-year-old believed the eased restrictions gave ""hope for the future"". ""And the rates are coming down which is great,"" she said. ""I think it's really good for mental health as well."" Any six people in Wales can meet outdoors from Saturday What are Wales' lockdown rules? What is the rule of six and what are the social distancing rules? Fiona, 53, from Llandaff, said: ""It's absolutely fantastic because we are used to running in a group. ""We always do sport together and it has been really sad not to have that companionship. ""We really enjoy running and being outside, and it is the first time we have been able to get together as a group for a really long time. ""It's wonderful."" Elin Llyr, from Victoria Park, thought it was ""lovely"" restrictions had been eased. ""It's been a really long year for everyone and I think now that the weather is nice we can meet outside,""  the 35-year-old said. ""I think it's been a long time coming really. ""Even though we have been sticking to the rules, we have been seeing people doing this for a number of weeks, so it is nice now that it is actually allowed."" Cai Llwyd Jones was enjoying the beach with Ela and Mabli (right) Cai Llwyd Jones, from Pentir, Gwynedd, was visiting Llanddwyn beach on Anglesey. He said the restrictions being eased was ""a welcome change"". ""Many people have been waiting for a long time to see their friends or members of their extended family, so on that front it is definitely a welcome change. ""But it has its pros and cons, because everywhere is busy as it is, and it is only going to get busier now."" Arj, Frank, Lucy and Elliott were out to ""enjoy the Welsh countryside"" Arj Fiutek, Frank McDermott, Lucy James and Elliott Ashton had travelled to the beach from Ruthin. Elliot thought it was ""nice"" to get out. ""We've been locked in for a while,"" he said. His friend Lucy agreed it was good to ""have a bit of normality back"". Arj was glad to see the sea to ""get a bit of fresh air and enjoy the Welsh countryside"". Since March, up to six people from a maximum of two households were allowed to meet outdoors after Wales' stay local lockdown rule ended. But that was eased further on Saturday to allow six people from six different households to meet outside, excluding children aged under 11. However, police have warned people not to congregate in hotspots, with dispersal orders in place at a number of beauty spots this weekend,giving police powers to break up crowds. From Monday, restaurants and cafes will also be able to re-open to serve customers al-fresco. First Minister Mark Drakeford said the move was guided by the fact there was a lower risk of catching Covid outdoors. It comes after the Welsh government announced gyms couldreopen earlier than previously planned. Wales went into lockdown just before Christmas following concern over a rise in cases - data showed that all of the UK's seven most infected local authority areas were in Wales. Now Wales has thelowest Covid case rate in the UK- around 15 cases per 100,000 people - with thehighest percentage of its populationvaccinated. The number of Covid patients in hospitals in Wales has also dropped to its lowest level.

Marianna SpringSpecialist disinformation and social media reporter The anti-lockdown ""Unite for Freedom"" protest took to the streets of London on Saturday A few
thousand anti-lockdown protesters have been marching through central London. Ostensibly
itâs been billed by organisers as a march against mandatory vaccine âpassportsâ
and in favour of âmedical freedomâ. But on
second glance - on the streets and in the channels on Telegram and Facebook
where the protests were organised - the crowds are heavily into fringe beliefs
and online conspiracy theories. One of
the largest banners on display, and by no means the only example, read âCovid
is a hoaxâ. We saw a
number of people carrying signs or wearing clothing referencingthe QAnon conspiracy theoryand its offshoot,âSave the Childrenâ- a fringe group unrelated to the charity of the same name. I spoke
to people who are opposed to Covid vaccines - and some opposed to all vaccines.
Others referenced anti-Semitic conspiracy theories and other false claims about
Covid. The
protesters have a hodgepodge of beliefs and theories and not a whole lot of
consistency, but they are united by one thing - theyâre convinced theyâre not
being told the âreal truthâ. Disneyland Paris - one of Europe's biggest tourist attractions in normal times - has opened up a mass coronavirus vaccination site at its convention centre. The centre will only be open at weekends but will be able to inoculate about 1,500 people every day, Thierry Coudert of the Seine-et-Marne department said. He said that number could rise to 3,000 or 4,000 a day, depending on the supply of vaccines. The park, which employs about 17,000 people, has been shut since October when non-essential businesses were told to close. France imposed its third national lockdown earlier this month as it battled a surge in cases of Covid-19. The government aims to give 20 million people at least one dose of a vaccine by mid-May - up from about 14 million currently. The batch of vaccines arrived in Damascus on Saturday A Chinese donation of 150,000 doses of its Sinopharm vaccine has arrived in the Syrian capital, Damascus, and another batch  is due to due to arrive soon, officials have said. Health minister Hassan Ghabash said the first doses would go to healthcare workers, followed by the elderly and people with chronic diseases. ""We appreciate this aid which will allow the health ministry
to combat the pandemic, to curb its impact on health, society
and the economy,"" Ghabash told
reporters at the airport on Saturday. China's ambassador to Syria said another 150,000 doses
would arrive soon. Earlier in the week,  Syria received a  delivery of 200,000 AstraZeneca shots via the global Covax scheme, which aims to ensure vaccines are shared fairly among all nations, rich and poor. Further deliveries are
due in the coming weeks, the UN said. A vaccination programme involving teams from the World Health Organization is due to be rolled out across Syria - in territory controlled by the government and also in areas occupied by rebel forces after 10 years of civil war. Syria has registered nearly 22,000 coronavirus infections since the pandemic began and more than 1,500 deaths. Ian YoungsEntertainment and Arts Reporter, BBC News Amanda Seyfried and Gary Oldman star in Mank, which has 10 Oscar nominations It's the Oscars on Sunday - traditionally Hollywood's biggest night of the year - but this time round, it feels decidedly more low-key. With cinemas closed around the world - on and off  - for more than a year, many of the nominated films have struggled to make an impact. The leading contender, with 10 nominations, is Mank: a black and white homage starring Gary Oldman as Citizen Kane screenwriter Herman J Mankiewicz. You can watch it on Netflix - but despite its flurry of nominations - it has remained ""almost invisible"" to most viewers, according to the TomÃ¡Å¡ VyskoÄil at Flix Patrol, a site that tries to measure the popularity of streaming films. Sharon Waxman, founder of The Wrap, says the dearth of cinematic releases has meant films have not become the subject ""of cultural conversation"" and are not on the public's radar. ""You need the critics, the festivals, the theatrical openings, the marketing, the PR,"" she adds. ""All of those things together are what drives that conversation"". But streaming expert Travis Bean argues Nomadland - the frontrunner for best picture - has probably reached more people than if cinemas had been open, thanks to streaming on Hulu. ""So many people can just access it if they have the subscription,"" he says. ""I know a lot of people who wouldn't normally watch these kinds of movies - and it's there, and they have seen it. ""For the movie that's expected to win best picture to just to be there for anybody, it's really interesting, and it gives it a kind of popularity that's different."" Interested in catching one of the contenders before Sunday's ceremony? Here'show you can watch them.  Spanish police have arrested a man on suspicion of assault after he allegedly ignored signs of having coronvirus and went on to infect 22 people. The man, who lives in the town of Manacor on the island of Majorca, took a Covid test after his temperature rose to more than 40C (104F), police said in a statement. But without waiting for the result he went to work and to the gym the following day.

Police said he ignored instructions to go home and walked around lowering his mask as he coughed at colleagues, taunting them: ""I'm going to infect you all with coronavirus."" Five people at work and three at the gym caught the virus and in turn passed it on to friends and family, including three toddlers.

Police said they opened an investigation in January following the outbreak in Manacor and reports that a worker had ""become infected but hidden his illness"". The daily figures also show the number of people to have received both vaccination doses has now surpassed 12 million. A total of 12,071,810 people have received two doses, while 33,508,590 have received one. A further 132 patients were admitted into hospital. A further 32 people have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus in the UK, according to thelatest government figures,external. There were also 2,061 cases reported. On Friday, there were 40 deaths and 2,678 cases. Anti-lockdown protesters have been marching in central London as part of what they have called a ""Unite for Freedom"" rally. The Metropolitan Policereleased a statement,externalearlier in which it advised people against attending large gatherings ""for the protection of yourselves and others"". Protesters have been carrying signs and placards showing their opposition to coronavirus restrictions Demonstrators have also been protesting against the idea of vaccine passports Protesters carry a giant inflatable syringe through central London Janhavee MooleBBC Marathi, Mumbai Hospitals in Delhi have been forced to display signs saying they have run out of oxygen India's rising wave of cases is pushing its healthcare system to the brink - from the country's richest cities to its remotest corners. Many stricken with coronavirus are dying while they wait. Hospitals are struggling to accommodate breathless patients, or even keep alive those who were lucky enough to find a bed. Social media feeds and WhatsApp groups are full of frantic pleas for oxygen cylinders. For a week, India has been reliving this nightmare on repeat, waiting for the terrifying moment when there is no oxygen left at all. For anyone who has watched the pandemic unfold here - from doctors to officials to journalists - this feels like dÃ©jÃ  vu. Seven months ago, the country had grappled with a similaroxygen shortage amid a rapid surge in case numbers. But this time, it's much worse. Typically, healthcare facilities consume about 15% of oxygen supply, leaving the rest for industrial use. But amid India's second wave, nearly 90% of the country's oxygen supply - 7,500 metric tonnes daily - is being diverted for medical use, according to Rajesh Bhushan, a senior health official. That's nearly three times higher than was consumed every day at the peak of the first wave in mid-September last year. Doctors and epidemiologists believe the deluge of cases is delaying tests and consultation, leading to many people being admitted to hospital when their condition is severe. So the demand for high-flow oxygen - and therefore more oxygen - is higher than it was during the last wave. Read morehere.

More than half of the UK's total population has received a first dose of a coronavirus vaccine, figures show. NHS England data up to 23 April shows that of the 38,189,536 total doses  given in England so far, 28,102,852 were first doses - a rise of 107,656 on the previous day. It means the UK first dose total so far is now 33,496,293, with more recent figures still to be reported by Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. The UK population is estimated to be 66,796,807, so the latest figures show that more than half the population have now had a first dose of a coronavirus vaccine. The UK's full coronavirus data will be released later this afternoon. Germany is the latest country to restrict travel from India where a surge in Covid infections is overwhelming health services. The government - which is battling against a third wave of infections - has classified India as a coronavirus ""high incidence area"", meaning anyone returning to Germany from there must
register with authorities before travelling and quarantine for 14 days on their return. ""In order not to endanger our vaccination campaign, travel to India must be significantly restricted,"" Health Minister Jens
Spahn told reporters. He added that, from Monday, foreign travellers coming from India would no longer be allowed to enter. Germans arriving from India would only be allowed
entry with a negative test result and would then go into isolation. Other countries to have restricted travel from India include the UK, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and New Zealand. Nan Douglas died at the age of 95 More than 10,000 people in Scotland have died with coronavirus. One of those was Nan Douglas, who worked her way up from shorthand typist to headteacher during a remarkable career. She was already a mother of three when she left her job as a school secretary at West Calder High School to enrol at Moray House in Edinburgh where she qualified as a primary school teacher. After losing her husband John when she was just 43, she found solace in working with disabled children and went on to be appointed head of Pinewood Special School in Blackburn, West Lothian. Following a spell living in Cornwall during her retirement, she returned to Scotland where she hosted a ""living wake"" with 80 friends and family on her 90th birthday. She lived independently in Milnathort, Kinross, and was admitted to hospital for a minor issue just before Christmas 2020. But she contracted Covid and never left. She died on 19 February 2021, aged 95. Headherefor more stories of some of those who have lost their lives in Scotland. If you are just joining us, here are some of the main coronavirus stories from the UK and around the world so far today.   Indians are waiting for hours to cremate the deceased as cases surge The rise in case numbers in India has been exponential in the second wave. On 18 June last year, India recorded 11,000 cases and in the next 60 days it added 35,000 new cases on average every day. On 10 February, at the start of the second wave, India confirmed 11,000 cases - and in the next 50 days, the daily average was around 22,000 cases. But in the following 10 days, cases rose sharply with the daily average reaching 89,800. Experts say this rapid increase shows that the second wave is spreading much faster across the country. Dr A Fathahudeen, who is part of Kerala state's Covid taskforce, said the rise was not entirely unexpected given that India let its guard down when daily infections in January fell to fewer than 20,000 from a peak of more than 90,000 in September. Big religious gatherings, the reopening of most public places and crowded election ralliesare being blamed for the uptick. Dr Fathahudeen said there were warning signs in February but ""we did not get our act together"". Read more about India's second wavehere. Teacher James Prodger moved to Singapore with his wife Alex and son Zachary in 2019 When maths teacher James Prodger left the UK with his wife and toddler to work in Singapore a couple of years ago, he envisioned a stint abroad peppered with exciting holidays in Southeast Asia and regular trips home to see family. ""Covid-19 really put a spanner in the works for us,"" he says. ""We were always intending to come here with the intention of being able to go home every six months. ""We went home three times in the first year and then we had friends due to come out for a holiday in Bali, but all those things we were looking forward to just disappeared."" The thought of being unable to get home quickly for a family emergency fills him with dread. ""A major consideration for us is our parents. My wife's parents, they are in their 70s,"" he said. ""What happens if one of our parents gets ill? That's always in the back of our minds."" As vaccine rollouts gather pace around the world and borders start to reopen, there will be a rush to book flights - not just from holiday-makers desperate for some sun, but also from those who haven't seen their families for months or even years, outside of a screen.

I wake up this morning to an anguished phone call from a school teacher, whose husband has been battling for his life in a Delhi hospital. I tell myself: another day of life in a city where breathing has become a luxury for so many. We work the phone, send SOS calls. I text a doctor friend working in critical care. I pick up the newspaper. Twenty-five critically ill patients have died in a private hospital. The oxygen pressure had been dialled down in critical care, the hospital said. There's a photograph of two men and a woman sharing a cylinder on the front page - three strangers, caught up in a tragedy brought upon by government negligence, sharing a lifeline. As the day progresses I realise nothing has changed. Patients are dying because there's no oxygen. Medicines are still scarce and on the black market. The teacher calls again. The hospital doesn't even have a spare oxygen flow meter, so she has to get one. We work the phones again, send out Twitter appeals. Someone manages to find a device. Despite government claims, things are going from bad to worse. There are no beds, few medicines. For many it's a slow road to death. Mr and Mrs Kirkup, who have been together for 18 years, were discharged on the same day A couple who spent their eighth wedding anniversary in hospital together after they both contracted Covid-19 have thanked staff for saving their lives. Peter and Sheila Kirkup were admitted to Sunderland Royal Hospital within days of each other earlier this year. ""We just didn't think we were going to come out, that's how bad it was,"" said Mr Kirkup, 67. Mrs Kirkup, 58, spent three days in intensive care after her condition deteriorated. ""It was very emotional but I am just so happy that we are both here together and alive,"" she said The pair kept in touch via Facetime during their hospital stay and to celebrate their anniversary, staff arranged for the couple to have their hospital meals together. Mr and Mrs Kirkup were discharged together six weeks ago. ""It's all thanks to the staff at Sunderland Royal, they were fantastic. We owe them. They saved our lives and we're just full of gratitude to them,"" said Mr Kirkup. Read more Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Brazil's environmental police in battle to reduce deforestation in the Amazon Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro has approved a cut to the environment ministry budget a day after he vowed to boost spending to tackle deforestation. At a US-led climate summit, he promised to double the money reserved for environmental enforcement and to end illegal deforestation by 2030. But the budget signed off on Friday did not include his spending pledge, or additional proposals made by Congress. His government has weakened protections and wants to develop protected areas. Critics say the president's promises on Thursday were linked to a controversial deal Brazil is negotiating with the US to receive financial aid in return for protecting the Amazon, the world's largest rainforest, and other areas. Illegal Amazon rainforest plots sold on Facebook Amazon under threat: Fires, loggers and virus The 2021 federal budget includes 2.1bn reais (Â£280m; $380m) for the environment ministry and agencies it oversees. The ministry had a budget of about 3bn reais in 2020. Late on Friday, Environment Minister Ricardo Salles said he had requested the economy ministry to review the numbers and fulfil the pledge made by President Bolsonaro at the virtual climate summit hosted by US President Joe Biden. The Bolsonaro government has called for protected areas in the Amazon to be developed The environmental policies of President Bolsonaro, who is supported by powerful agribusiness leaders, have drawn widespread condemnation. The far-right leader has encouraged agriculture and mining in the Amazon, and rolled back environmental legislation. Last year, deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon surged to a 12-year high.Activists and indigenous groups say environmental enforcement remains underfunded, and denounce the impunity for illegal logging and mining in protected areas. The president rejects the criticism, saying Brazil remains an example for conservation. But at Thursday's summit he attempted to strike a more conciliatory tone, and also promised that Brazil would reach zero carbon emissions by 2050, 10 years earlier than previously agreed. Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon surged to a 12-year high in 2020 Brazilian and US officials have been discussing the possibility of collaborating to stop the destruction of the Amazon. Politicians and environmentalists have warned that the Bolsonaro government should show results first before any financial commitment is made. Earlier this week,a group of 35 US and Brazilian celebrities voiced their opposition to a deal with Brazil,saying it risked legitimising a government that was encouraging environmental destruction. The document followed another letter in which more than 200 Brazilian groups told President Biden that the Bolsonaro government was an ""enemy"" of the Amazon and that it did not have legitimacy to represent Brazil. Last week, the environment minister said the country would need $1bn in foreign aid to support efforts to reduce deforestation in the Amazon by 30% to 40% in a year.

"Signs turning patients away have become commonplace ""Oxygen, oxygen, can you get me oxygen?"" I wake up this morning to an anguished phone call from a school teacher, whose 46-year-old husband has been battling Covid-19 in an oxygen-starved Delhi hospital. Here we go again, I tell myself. Just another day of life in a city where breathing has become a luxury for so many. We work the phone, send SOS calls. Amid the sounds of beeping monitors, the woman tells us that her husband's oxygen saturation number has dipped to a precariously low 58. A bit later it rises to 62. You are supposed to consult your doctor if the number sinks to 92 or lower. She tells us she is happy it has gone up. And her husband is still talking and aware. I text a doctor friend working in critical care. ""Patients remain talkative even when the number hits 40,"" she messages me. This video can not be played The BBC's Yogita Limaye reports from a hospital in Delhi, which is running low on beds and oxygen I pick up the newspaper. Twenty five critically ill patients have died in a well-known private hospital. The oxygen pressure had been dialled down in critical care and many patients were being given oxygen manually, the hospital said. There's a photograph of two men and a woman sharing a cylinder on the front page. Three strangers -  caught up in a tragedy brought upon by public laxity and government negligence - sharing a lifeline. The 40-year-old son of one of the men, a report says, died outside the same hospital a few days ago, waiting for a bed. He had found a stretcher though, the report helpfully said. That's what grieving Indians are grateful for now: if you can't provide beds or medicines or oxygen to save my loved one, at least give them a gurney to rest their corpses. Indian hospitals send SOS as Covid toll surges How India failed to prevent a deadly second wave As the day progresses, I realise nothing has changed. Patients are dying because there's no oxygen. Medicines are still scarce and on the black market. There's hoarding and panic buying as if we are in a war. In many ways, we are. The teacher calls again. The hospital doesn't even have a spare oxygen flow meter, so she has to get one. We work the phones, send out Twitter appeals. Someone manages to pick up a device, which is used for regulating supply from the cylinder to the patient. Despite what the government says, things are going from bad to worse. Oxygen tankers are not making it in time to the city to save patients. There are no beds, few medicines. Even India's privileged have no privilege left: a magazine editor called me in the afternoon, looking for an oxygen cylinder for a sick patient, whom he knows. In the apartment building where I live, residents are trying to buy some oxygen concentrators in case someone ""needs help with breathing"". Fifty seven residents are infected and isolated in their homes. Delhi and Mumbai have some of the best healthcare facilities in India, but have been overwhelmed Patients have been left to fend for themselves. For many it's a slow and gradual road to death. Covid-19 is a disease with too many ambushes. ""Even if I'm dying, until I actually die, I am still living,"" Paul Kalanithi, a neurosurgeon, wrote in his piercing memoir, When Breath Becomes Air. There are only small mercies for the gasping victims of a deadly virus in India today.

"The lobbying controversy that has enveloped Westminster is a complex and fast-developing story but there is one strand running right through the centre of it - the smartphone. WhatsApp and text messages have replaced face-to-face meetings and letters as the favourite method of communication for politicians. The casual, and sometimes untraceable, nature of these communications can make it harder for the Civil Service to ensure everyone - ministers, officials, businesses and lobbyists - plays by the rules. It wasn't that long ago that everything was typed out in triplicate, and phone calls were routed through Whitehall switchboards, with officials listening in and taking notes. Cummings denies leaking PM's text messages Cameron: Nonsense to say Greensill was desperate No 10 announces leak inquiry into PM-Dyson texts Tony Blair didn't get a mobile phone until he left Downing Street in 2007. Now politicians, like the rest of us, can't live without them. Following a series of revelations about ministers' use of texts and messaging apps, Labour has warned that the UK is heading towards ""government by WhatsApp"". It's a catchy slogan, but it might be a bit dated, as the prime minister and other leading politicians arereportedly migrating to Signal,,externala rival messaging app. Users can set encrypted messages to automatically delete after short periods of time, even as short as five seconds. They can also stop screenshots being taken of exchanges if they are using an Android phone. Messages sent and received on Facebook-owned WhatsApp - which has been around since 2009 - are also encrypted, but screenshots can be taken and shared. Ministers are issued with work mobile phones when they get a job in government. Until a few years ago, they were given Blackberries, but nowthe iPhone seems to be the favoured brand. The idea is to ensure that professional and personal calls, texts and emails are kept separate from their personal communications. ""I was given a phone as soon as I started,"" one former Conservative minister tells the BBC, ""but I wasn't sat down and issued with any advice on how to use it."" A government source says: ""Clearly ministers may have informal conversations from time-to-time, whether that is in person, via digital communications or remotely, and if they find themselves discussing official business then significant content from such discussions should be passed back to officials."" In official guidance,external, designed for private emails but applying to all electronic communications, ministers are told to work out whether they include details on ""substantive discussions"" or ""decisions"" made on government business. If they do, they should then forward them to civil servants. The ministerial code,,externallaying out general rules of behaviour, says that a private secretary or another official should be present for ""all discussions relating to government"", to ensure transparency. If that's impossible - such as when ministers chat to business leaders at social events - they have to report back to civil servants as soon as possible. It's widely accepted that phone messaging should be reported in the same way if it's about important official business. Communication was very different in Margaret Thatcher's day But the Institute for Government (IfG) think tank wants a tightening of the rules, so that all messages sent and received on official phones - about whatever topic - are logged, with the names of those taking part published quarterly. This already happens for meetings ministers attend. ""There needs to a public record that something's happened,"" IfG associate director Tim Durrant says. ""Texting's essentially a conversation, like a meeting."" A source who used to work in Whitehall in a senior role says it was ""normal"" for ministers to have text exchanges with business leaders - and then let civil servants know about them. ""There's nothing wrong with the leaders of this country talking to captains of industry,"" they add. ""It's a part of how government functions. We live in a free country. ""What really annoys me is that there's an assumption of wrongdoing of some sort here. It's wrong to say government is run by text message. It's a form of communication that everyone uses for personal and official matters."" Culture minister Caroline Dinenage told Times Radio ministers did not hand out their mobile numbers ""willy-nilly"" and there were ""very clear rules"" about handing contacts to civil servants. But Labour argues that the government's use of messaging fosters ""cronyism"", that those with ministers' phone numbers have an unfair advantage over those who do not. An ex-minister tells the BBC they kept personal and official messages completely separate when they were in office. ""You have to rely on people using their common sense,"" they add. ""Some ministers actually hand the work mobile across to be carried by a special adviser or a member of their team, so they're not too close to it and don't use it in an inappropriate way. ""You've also got to be careful as to whom you give your number out to."" Some in government have suggested the prime minister should be less willing to share his personal contact details, the BBC understands, but officials have denied that he was told to change his number. But Mr Johnson says he will keep his phone, arguing: ""I need to be in touch with people... You need one these days."" And there would inevitably be resistance to any rule change among some in Whitehall. One former special adviser asks: ""What are ministers supposed to do? Put in a 30-page submission for every transaction they carry out, even in the midst of a pandemic?""

"This video can not be played The PM queries those who say there's something ""dodgy or rum or weird or sleazy"" about securing more ventilators in a pandemic. Boris Johnson has said anyone who thinks there was something ""dodgy or rum"" in his dealings with Sir James Dyson is ""out of their mind"". The PM was responding to claims by Labour that he was personally involved in ""sleaze"" after texts between the two were revealed by the BBC. Downing Street declined to comment on ""speculation"" Mr Johnson's former aide Dominic Cummings had leaked the texts. The government has launched an internal inquiry into who was responsible. The prime minister's spokesman said: ""We don't get into detail of processes in terms of these inquiries, but the Cabinet Office is taking that work forward."" The BBC said it did not discuss the sources of stories. Cameron: Nonsense to say Greensill was desperate Labour urges probe into revamp of PM's official flat Why ministers have two mobile phones What is lobbying? A brief guide Mr Johnson was speaking on a visit to Derbyshire as allegations of cronyism abound at Westminster. This video can not be played Labour leader claims ""sleaze is back"" after allegations over lobbying of the PM and a former PM. On Tuesdaythe BBC published text messagesbetween Mr Johnson and Sir James, in which the prime minister agreed to ""fix"" concerns the businessman had over his employees' tax bills if they moved to the UK to make ventilators at the start of the pandemic. Asked whether this proved Labour's allegation that friends of the Conservatives were given privileged access, the prime minister said it was ""completely the right thing to do"" to ask manufacturers to help bolster supplies of equipment needed to treat Covid patients. ""To think that there's anything remotely dodgy or rum or weird or sleazy about trying to secure more ventilators at the time of a national pandemic and doing everything in your power to do that, I think you're out of your mind,"" he added. But Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, who was on a visit to Hartlepool, said it was ""increasingly obvious"" the prime minister was involved in ""sleaze"". Asked if media reports pointing to Mr Cummings as the source of leaks were part of an attempt to distract from lobbying allegations, Sir Keir said: ""Boris Johnson is desperate to try to keep this at arm's length but it's obvious that he can't. This is government by WhatsApp. ""They are all at it - whether it's access to the prime minister, whether it's the former prime minister accessing ministers and officials, whether it's the health secretary with shares in companies with the contracts with the NHS. The list just grows and grows... ""Sleaze is back and it's bigger than it was before."" Shadow Treasury minister Bridget Phillipson tweeted: ""Dominic Cummings is a distraction. Follow the money, not the soap opera."" Mr Cummings has not accepted invitations to respond to the reports and, so far, no evidence of his involvement in the leaks has been produced. Labour has called for an urgent investigation into the prime minister's conduct by the Liaison Committee of senior MPs. It said the text messages showed Mr Johnson had offered a ""tax break"" to a ""chum"". The head of the committee, Conservative MP Sir Bernard Jenkin, turned down the call for an inquiry, saying three other parliamentary committees were already looking at the issues. He told Radio 4's Today programme ministers should not be ""locked away in ivory towers"" with people unable to contact them and should be able to carry out conversations about policy in private, as this would ""stifle proper conversation"". ""What's got to come out of this is obviously a system of managing conflicts of interest, which commands more public confidence, and is more rigorous, but also a balance,"" he added. The SNP's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, has written to the Cabinet Secretary, calling for officials to ""secure and publish"" all Mr Johnson's private correspondence on coronavirus contracts, and not just his texts with Sir James Dyson. He said ""such a narrow and limited internal investigation totally and utterly fails to address the scale of the scandal"".

"Sir James Dyson texted the prime minister last March when he was involved in efforts to provide ventilators Labour has called for a ""thorough investigation"" into Boris Johnson's contacts with inventor Sir James Dyson. Shadow Cabinet Office minister Rachel Reeves said the messages between the prime minister and Sir James opened up a ""new urgent corridor of inquiry"". The texts - seen by the BBC - show Mr Johnson saying he could ""fix"" tax issues relating to Dyson staff who came to the UK to work on the pandemic. The PM said he made ""no apology"" for trying to get ventilators for the NHS. Labour has said the text messages are part of a pattern of government ""sleaze"" and has called on the cross-party Liaison Committee of senior MPs to investigate ""as soon as possible"". Ms Reeves claimed there was ""a growing feeling that if someone has access to a telephone number of someone like the prime minister or the chancellor, then they are able to gain special treatment"". Liaison Committee Chair Sir Bernard Jenkin said the MPs would consider Ms Reeves request adding that the prime minster was due to appear in front of the committee before the summer recess. Billionaire Dyson moves residency back to the UK PM: I did right thing over Dyson ventilators What is lobbying? A brief guide In March last year, the Department of Health feared the NHS in England would need as many as 20,000 additional ventilators to deal with Covid patients. It asked companies, including Dyson, which is based in Singapore, to help. The prime minister is understood to have called Sir James on 13 March and asked him to participate. Dyson answered the call - although subsequently the company was not called upon to provide ventilators to the NHS. Sir James contacted the Treasury for assurances there would be no extra tax to pay for employees who came to the UK to help. When he failed to get a response, he texted the prime minister directly. In exchanges seen by the BBC, Mr Johnson messaged Sir James saying: ""[Chancellor] Rishi [Sunak] says it is fixed!! We need you here."" When the businessman sought further reassurance for the tax status of the firm and ""senior individuals"", Mr Johnson replied: ""I am First Lord of the Treasury and you can take it that we are backing you to do what you need."" Two weeks later, Mr Sunak told a group of MPs that the tax status of people who came to the UK to provide specific help during the pandemic would not be affected. On Wednesday, Mr Johnson said he made ""no apology for moving heaven and earth"" to persuade businesses to help bolster supplies of equipment and ventilators to treat coronavirus patients. He said he had done the ""right thing"" and that ""any prime minister"" would have done the same in the circumstances. SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford called on Mr Johnson to reveal ""how many more Covid contracts he personally fixed"" and publish all personal exchanges on these contracts. But Mr Johnson said there was ""nothing to conceal about this"" and he would share details with MPs. The prime minister's official spokesman said Mr Johnson had abided by the ministerial code, governing conduct in office, and had ""informed officials in a timely manner"" after his contact with Sir James. He added that he did not know when the prime minister would publish his exchanges with Sir James. Separately, it is understood some in government have suggested the prime minister should be less willing to share his personal contact details - but officials have denied that he was told to change his mobile phone number. It was also revealed recently that former Prime Minister David Cameron hadcontacted several ministers- including Chancellor Rishi Sunak, whom he texted - on behalf of the failed finance firm Greensill Capital. Several inquiries have been launched looking into the work of lobbyists, whose job it is to influence government policy. Mr Cameron has denied that he broke any codes of conduct or any government rules on lobbying.

Marianna SpringSpecialist disinformation and social media reporter The anti-lockdown ""Unite for Freedom"" protest took to the streets of London on Saturday A few
thousand anti-lockdown protesters have been marching through central London. Ostensibly
itâs been billed by organisers as a march against mandatory vaccine âpassportsâ
and in favour of âmedical freedomâ. But on
second glance - on the streets and in the channels on Telegram and Facebook
where the protests were organised - the crowds are heavily into fringe beliefs
and online conspiracy theories. One of
the largest banners on display, and by no means the only example, read âCovid
is a hoaxâ. We saw a
number of people carrying signs or wearing clothing referencingthe QAnon conspiracy theoryand its offshoot,âSave the Childrenâ- a fringe group unrelated to the charity of the same name. I spoke
to people who are opposed to Covid vaccines - and some opposed to all vaccines.
Others referenced anti-Semitic conspiracy theories and other false claims about
Covid. The
protesters have a hodgepodge of beliefs and theories and not a whole lot of
consistency, but they are united by one thing - theyâre convinced theyâre not
being told the âreal truthâ. Disneyland Paris - one of Europe's biggest tourist attractions in normal times - has opened up a mass coronavirus vaccination site at its convention centre. The centre will only be open at weekends but will be able to inoculate about 1,500 people every day, Thierry Coudert of the Seine-et-Marne department said. He said that number could rise to 3,000 or 4,000 a day, depending on the supply of vaccines. The park, which employs about 17,000 people, has been shut since October when non-essential businesses were told to close. France imposed its third national lockdown earlier this month as it battled a surge in cases of Covid-19. The government aims to give 20 million people at least one dose of a vaccine by mid-May - up from about 14 million currently. The batch of vaccines arrived in Damascus on Saturday A Chinese donation of 150,000 doses of its Sinopharm vaccine has arrived in the Syrian capital, Damascus, and another batch  is due to due to arrive soon, officials have said. Health minister Hassan Ghabash said the first doses would go to healthcare workers, followed by the elderly and people with chronic diseases. ""We appreciate this aid which will allow the health ministry
to combat the pandemic, to curb its impact on health, society
and the economy,"" Ghabash told
reporters at the airport on Saturday. China's ambassador to Syria said another 150,000 doses
would arrive soon. Earlier in the week,  Syria received a  delivery of 200,000 AstraZeneca shots via the global Covax scheme, which aims to ensure vaccines are shared fairly among all nations, rich and poor. Further deliveries are
due in the coming weeks, the UN said. A vaccination programme involving teams from the World Health Organization is due to be rolled out across Syria - in territory controlled by the government and also in areas occupied by rebel forces after 10 years of civil war. Syria has registered nearly 22,000 coronavirus infections since the pandemic began and more than 1,500 deaths. Ian YoungsEntertainment and Arts Reporter, BBC News Amanda Seyfried and Gary Oldman star in Mank, which has 10 Oscar nominations It's the Oscars on Sunday - traditionally Hollywood's biggest night of the year - but this time round, it feels decidedly more low-key. With cinemas closed around the world - on and off  - for more than a year, many of the nominated films have struggled to make an impact. The leading contender, with 10 nominations, is Mank: a black and white homage starring Gary Oldman as Citizen Kane screenwriter Herman J Mankiewicz. You can watch it on Netflix - but despite its flurry of nominations - it has remained ""almost invisible"" to most viewers, according to the TomÃ¡Å¡ VyskoÄil at Flix Patrol, a site that tries to measure the popularity of streaming films. Sharon Waxman, founder of The Wrap, says the dearth of cinematic releases has meant films have not become the subject ""of cultural conversation"" and are not on the public's radar. ""You need the critics, the festivals, the theatrical openings, the marketing, the PR,"" she adds. ""All of those things together are what drives that conversation"". But streaming expert Travis Bean argues Nomadland - the frontrunner for best picture - has probably reached more people than if cinemas had been open, thanks to streaming on Hulu. ""So many people can just access it if they have the subscription,"" he says. ""I know a lot of people who wouldn't normally watch these kinds of movies - and it's there, and they have seen it. ""For the movie that's expected to win best picture to just to be there for anybody, it's really interesting, and it gives it a kind of popularity that's different.""

Spanish police have arrested a man on suspicion of assault after he allegedly ignored signs of having coronvirus and went on to infect 22 people. The man, who lives in the town of Manacor on the island of Majorca, took a Covid test after his temperature rose to more than 40C (104F), police said in a statement. But without waiting for the result he went to work and to the gym the following day.

Police said he ignored instructions to go home and walked around lowering his mask as he coughed at colleagues, taunting them: ""I'm going to infect you all with coronavirus."" Five people at work and three at the gym caught the virus and in turn passed it on to friends and family, including three toddlers.

Police said they opened an investigation in January following the outbreak in Manacor and reports that a worker had ""become infected but hidden his illness"". The daily figures also show the number of people to have received both vaccination doses has now surpassed 12 million. A total of 12,071,810 people have received two doses, while 33,508,590 have received one. A further 132 patients were admitted into hospital. A further 32 people have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus in the UK, according to thelatest government figures,external. There were also 2,061 cases reported. On Friday, there were 40 deaths and 2,678 cases. Anti-lockdown protesters have been marching in central London as part of what they have called a ""Unite for Freedom"" rally. The Metropolitan Policereleased a statement,externalearlier in which it advised people against attending large gatherings ""for the protection of yourselves and others"". Protesters have been carrying signs and placards showing their opposition to coronavirus restrictions Demonstrators have also been protesting against the idea of vaccine passports Protesters carry a giant inflatable syringe through central London Janhavee MooleBBC Marathi, Mumbai Hospitals in Delhi have been forced to display signs saying they have run out of oxygen India's rising wave of cases is pushing its healthcare system to the brink - from the country's richest cities to its remotest corners. Many stricken with coronavirus are dying while they wait. Hospitals are struggling to accommodate breathless patients, or even keep alive those who were lucky enough to find a bed. Social media feeds and WhatsApp groups are full of frantic pleas for oxygen cylinders. For a week, India has been reliving this nightmare on repeat, waiting for the terrifying moment when there is no oxygen left at all. For anyone who has watched the pandemic unfold here - from doctors to officials to journalists - this feels like dÃ©jÃ  vu. Seven months ago, the country had grappled with a similaroxygen shortage amid a rapid surge in case numbers. But this time, it's much worse. Typically, healthcare facilities consume about 15% of oxygen supply, leaving the rest for industrial use. But amid India's second wave, nearly 90% of the country's oxygen supply - 7,500 metric tonnes daily - is being diverted for medical use, according to Rajesh Bhushan, a senior health official. That's nearly three times higher than was consumed every day at the peak of the first wave in mid-September last year. Doctors and epidemiologists believe the deluge of cases is delaying tests and consultation, leading to many people being admitted to hospital when their condition is severe. So the demand for high-flow oxygen - and therefore more oxygen - is higher than it was during the last wave. Read morehere.

More than half of the UK's total population has received a first dose of a coronavirus vaccine, figures show. NHS England data up to 23 April shows that of the 38,189,536 total doses  given in England so far, 28,102,852 were first doses - a rise of 107,656 on the previous day. It means the UK first dose total so far is now 33,496,293, with more recent figures still to be reported by Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. The UK population is estimated to be 66,796,807, so the latest figures show that more than half the population have now had a first dose of a coronavirus vaccine. The UK's full coronavirus data will be released later this afternoon. Germany is the latest country to restrict travel from India where a surge in Covid infections is overwhelming health services. The government - which is battling against a third wave of infections - has classified India as a coronavirus ""high incidence area"", meaning anyone returning to Germany from there must
register with authorities before travelling and quarantine for 14 days on their return. ""In order not to endanger our vaccination campaign, travel to India must be significantly restricted,"" Health Minister Jens
Spahn told reporters. He added that, from Monday, foreign travellers coming from India would no longer be allowed to enter. Germans arriving from India would only be allowed
entry with a negative test result and would then go into isolation. Other countries to have restricted travel from India include the UK, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and New Zealand. Nan Douglas died at the age of 95 More than 10,000 people in Scotland have died with coronavirus. One of those was Nan Douglas, who worked her way up from shorthand typist to headteacher during a remarkable career. She was already a mother of three when she left her job as a school secretary at West Calder High School to enrol at Moray House in Edinburgh where she qualified as a primary school teacher. After losing her husband John when she was just 43, she found solace in working with disabled children and went on to be appointed head of Pinewood Special School in Blackburn, West Lothian. Following a spell living in Cornwall during her retirement, she returned to Scotland where she hosted a ""living wake"" with 80 friends and family on her 90th birthday. She lived independently in Milnathort, Kinross, and was admitted to hospital for a minor issue just before Christmas 2020. But she contracted Covid and never left. She died on 19 February 2021, aged 95. Headherefor more stories of some of those who have lost their lives in Scotland. If you are just joining us, here are some of the main coronavirus stories from the UK and around the world so far today.   Indians are waiting for hours to cremate the deceased as cases surge The rise in case numbers in India has been exponential in the second wave. On 18 June last year, India recorded 11,000 cases and in the next 60 days it added 35,000 new cases on average every day. On 10 February, at the start of the second wave, India confirmed 11,000 cases - and in the next 50 days, the daily average was around 22,000 cases. But in the following 10 days, cases rose sharply with the daily average reaching 89,800. Experts say this rapid increase shows that the second wave is spreading much faster across the country. Dr A Fathahudeen, who is part of Kerala state's Covid taskforce, said the rise was not entirely unexpected given that India let its guard down when daily infections in January fell to fewer than 20,000 from a peak of more than 90,000 in September. Big religious gatherings, the reopening of most public places and crowded election ralliesare being blamed for the uptick. Dr Fathahudeen said there were warning signs in February but ""we did not get our act together"". Read more about India's second wavehere. Teacher James Prodger moved to Singapore with his wife Alex and son Zachary in 2019 When maths teacher James Prodger left the UK with his wife and toddler to work in Singapore a couple of years ago, he envisioned a stint abroad peppered with exciting holidays in Southeast Asia and regular trips home to see family. ""Covid-19 really put a spanner in the works for us,"" he says. ""We were always intending to come here with the intention of being able to go home every six months. ""We went home three times in the first year and then we had friends due to come out for a holiday in Bali, but all those things we were looking forward to just disappeared."" The thought of being unable to get home quickly for a family emergency fills him with dread. ""A major consideration for us is our parents. My wife's parents, they are in their 70s,"" he said. ""What happens if one of our parents gets ill? That's always in the back of our minds."" As vaccine rollouts gather pace around the world and borders start to reopen, there will be a rush to book flights - not just from holiday-makers desperate for some sun, but also from those who haven't seen their families for months or even years, outside of a screen.

I wake up this morning to an anguished phone call from a school teacher, whose husband has been battling for his life in a Delhi hospital. I tell myself: another day of life in a city where breathing has become a luxury for so many. We work the phone, send SOS calls. I text a doctor friend working in critical care. I pick up the newspaper. Twenty-five critically ill patients have died in a private hospital. The oxygen pressure had been dialled down in critical care, the hospital said. There's a photograph of two men and a woman sharing a cylinder on the front page - three strangers, caught up in a tragedy brought upon by government negligence, sharing a lifeline. As the day progresses I realise nothing has changed. Patients are dying because there's no oxygen. Medicines are still scarce and on the black market. The teacher calls again. The hospital doesn't even have a spare oxygen flow meter, so she has to get one. We work the phones again, send out Twitter appeals. Someone manages to find a device. Despite government claims, things are going from bad to worse. There are no beds, few medicines. For many it's a slow road to death. Mr and Mrs Kirkup, who have been together for 18 years, were discharged on the same day A couple who spent their eighth wedding anniversary in hospital together after they both contracted Covid-19 have thanked staff for saving their lives. Peter and Sheila Kirkup were admitted to Sunderland Royal Hospital within days of each other earlier this year. ""We just didn't think we were going to come out, that's how bad it was,"" said Mr Kirkup, 67. Mrs Kirkup, 58, spent three days in intensive care after her condition deteriorated. ""It was very emotional but I am just so happy that we are both here together and alive,"" she said The pair kept in touch via Facetime during their hospital stay and to celebrate their anniversary, staff arranged for the couple to have their hospital meals together. Mr and Mrs Kirkup were discharged together six weeks ago. ""It's all thanks to the staff at Sunderland Royal, they were fantastic. We owe them.

"The contract was awarded to a firm which offers a service to connect GPs to specialist consultants for treatment advice A Â£650,000 per year contract awarded by the Welsh government without an open tender process has been criticised by opposition parties in Wales. Consultant Connect, which offers a service where GPs can talk directly to specialist consultants for advice, was awarded the contract last April. The Welsh government said the award was fully compliant with rules and Covid's impact had justified the direct award. Plaid Cymru and the Liberal Democrats have called for an open tender process. Some medical professionals have also expressed concerns about the system, which can connect GPs in Wales to consultants in England, due to differences between the devolved Welsh NHS and the healthcare system in England. The Welsh government confirmed the body responsible for NHS Wales procurement was ""in the process of undertaking a direct award/extending the contract to ensure continuation of the service until a full evaluation of the service has been completed"". Rebuilding NHS 'could be bigger task than Covid' Ministers and NHS 'responded well' on PPE supplies Tendering offers businesses and taxpayers greater transparency and understanding of the process in granting public contracts and concerns have been raised by opposition parties about an alleged lack of transparency in awarding the contract. Rhun ap Iowerth, who speaks on health for Plaid Cymru, said: ""It is possible to award contracts in an exceptionally fast way and without a tender where there is no other option. There is also an option of going through tender processes which are open but very quick. ""Especially now, when we come to renewing the contract, surely there is no excuse for at least going through a tender process which is open but fast?"" Cadan ap Tomos, the Welsh Liberal Democrat candidate for Ceredigion, said: ""It is 12 months since this contract was first awarded. ""Having had 12 months to consider whether this is the best way to offer a particular service, it is imperative a fairer process is in place and that a public tender process is allowed to take place."" Rhun ap Iorwerth of Plaid Cymru said there was ""no excuse"" for the contract to have not been put through an ""open but fast"" tendering process The Welsh Conservatives and Welsh Labour both declined to comment. At the time of the awarding of the contract, the then-non-executive chairman of Consultant Connect had links with the Labour party. He was previously a director of a company which ""developed the entire online infrastructure for the UK Labour party"". He had also been a director of Labour List, a website supportive but independent of the Labour party. Both Welsh Labour and the Welsh government declined to comment on links between the company and the Labour party. Consultant Connect said: ""The contract with the Welsh government originated from a clinician who had previously seen the benefits of Consultant Connect in another healthcare area. ""It was not the result of solicitation from Consultant Connect nor anyone associated with Consultant Connect."" GPs' 'important' call target delayed in Wales Covid: How many people have died in Wales? Several GPs also told BBC Wales they were often, if not always, referred to consultants working in England. Some were concerned advice and treatment suggested broke local guidelines in Wales. Dr Phil White, chairman of BMA Cymru's GP committee, told BBC Wales's Newyddion S4C programme: ""The concept is very good. It's a way of getting a rapid response from a consultant in the speciality you are looking for. ""The downside has been many of the consultants signed up for the scheme are in England and of course there are certain differences between the NHS in Wales and England and how things are run."" Dr Phil White from BMA Cymru said the concept of the service was ""very good,"" but raised concerns over GPs being connected to England-based consultants The Welsh government said: ""Calls are taken by a NHS consultant, registrar or nurse practitioner and wherever possible, local clinicians are used to provide the advice. ""Where this is not possible, then the calls may be routed to a national network of NHS clinicians."" Consultant Connect said: ""Most calls on Consultant Connect are between a local GP and a local specialist as we know that local advice is always best. ""But we also know that, where no local specialists are available to take a call, advice from another UK specialist may still be better than no advice at all.""
