We'll be back bright and early at 06:00 on Thursday. Do join us then for all the latest breaking news and analysis from the wonderful world of business. New Zealand government's move to prevent Huawei supplying a local mobile network with 5G equipment has raised questions about why the UK appears less concerned about use of the Chinese company's technology. The US and Australia had already closed the door on Huawei's involvement in their next-generation mobile networks. That means three members of the Five Eyes intelligence alliance have now acted against the Shenzhen-based company. And one other member, Canada,is carrying out a security review of its own,external. So, there's a prospect that the UK could soon be the sole holdout, allowing Huawei to play a key role in delivering the data that everything from self-driving cars to smart city sensors will rely on.

Wall Street shares have ended higher after Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell's remarks to the New York Economic Club suggesting that interest rates might not rise too much further. TheDow Jones Industrial Averageclosed 2.5% ahead at 25,366. TheS&P 500ended 2.3% up at 2,742. And finally, the tech-heavyNasdaqfinished 3% higher at 7,292. Barclays says it passed the Bank of England's stress tests with a 8.9% minimum stressed transitional common equity tier 1 ratio, after taking account of strategic management actions, which is above the stress test hurdle rate of 7.9%. As a result, Barclays intends to pay its shareholders a 2018 dividend of 6.5p, subject to regulatory approvals. Dave LeeNorth America technology reporter Mark Luckie left Facebook in early November When it rains, it pours - and Facebookâs utterly sodden year continues to be flooded by accusations of bad governance. Mark Luckie, a black, former Facebook employee whose job it was to handle the firmâs relationship with âinfluencersâ, put it quite plainly: âFacebook has a black people problem.â His 2,500-word note, posted on Tuesday, outlines what he sees as a culture that talks about inclusion, but does not practise it. In some buildings at the company, Mr Luckie said, there were âmore âBlack Lives Matterâ posters than there are actual black peopleâ. Read more here. Big four accounting firm KPMG says that the Bank of England has clearly taken British banks ""off the European naughty step"", but if you look into the detail of the Bank of England's stress test results, it's not as rosy as things seem. âOur banks are very well capitalised, but, the
impact of the accounting standard, IFRS9, was keenly felt under these
scenarios. When you look at the results in light of a âfully loadedâ IFRS9, two
banks fall well below the âpass markâ with their capital severely depleted,"" said KPMG UK's banking partner Rob Smith. âDespite, once again, the banks all passing,
investors and bank staff may be unnerved when they delve into the detail.
Dividend payments drop to almost zero from Â£28 billion, meanwhile bonuses fall
from Â£11bn to just over Â£1bn over the first two years of the stress. âFurther, the Bank of England raised several issues
with the models used to perform the tests including a lack of understanding by
Board members. This could cause some to question how reliable the results
actually are.â US financial markets have risen sharply. Why? Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has signalled that the Federal Reserve may not raise interest rates much more -  a boon for share prices which typically fall as interest rates rise. In a speech in New York, Mr Powell said interest rates are ""just below the broad range of estimates of the level that would be neutral for the economy - that is, neither speeding up nor slowing down growth."" Last month, Mr Powell said the bank was a ""long way"" from neutral. But he may be trying to project a softer tone after repeated criticism from US President Donald Trump about the Fed's plans to raise rates. Chair of the pro-Brexit
European Research Group Jacob Rees-Mogg is not impressed with Mark Carney today. âThe Bank of England is meant to
be a cautious and dignified body - not one that gives out hysterical
statements,"" he said in the House of Commons. âWhat theyâve said today lacks all credibility and is a
regurgitation of project fear to come project hysteria. âI think it discredits the governor - who is basically a
failed second rate Canadian politician who is talking down the pound which I
think is unprecedented.â Prominent Brexiteer and former Tory leader Iain Duncan
Smith agrees. He told the BBC: âThe bottom line of both sets of reports is that project
fear like Frankensteinâs monster has been resuscitated and is stalking the
land.â Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has said,externalthat rising levels of corporate debt are a risk to investors - but not yet to wider financial stability. However, his remarks about corporate debt made it clear that he views it as a greater risk than other factors, such as financial markets, bank stability and consumer borrowing. He said business borrowing presents a ""subtler story"" than other areas of the economy like household debt, later adding: ""There are reasons for concern.""

The Bank of England isn't the only body out there worried about Brexit. The US central bank has also flagged the disruption caused by the UK's exit from the European Union as a risk to the American economy. The topic is mentioned in the Federal Reserve's newfinancial stability report,externaland ina speech in New York on Wednesday,external, Fed Chair Jerome Powell called the event a good example of a potential ""trigger"" for financial distress in the US. Accountancy giant PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) says that British banks have actually become more resilient than last year. ""The Bank of England stress test results show that the major UK banks can withstand an extreme stress, akin to a
âdisorderlyâ Brexit, and, crucially, can continue to support their
customers. In comparison to the 2017 stress test, the major UK banks have
increased their resilience to an extreme economic shock, as well as
increased the tools at managements' disposal to recover from a downturn,"" said PwC stress testing leader and partner Raf Hussain. ""Key actions included curtailing of dividends and conversion
of additional Tier 1 capital for some banks. The Prudential Regulation
Authority also noted that some banks had made improvements in their analysis
and submission. ""However, further work could be required to improve their model
risk management for stress testing."" Santander UK has reminded us that for the third year in a row, it had the lowest stressed common equity tier 1 capital ratio impact of all the banks stress tested by the Bank of England. ""The PRA has examined extreme but
plausible stress scenarios for the UK economy and has found that Santander UK
has more than adequate capital to withstand such occurrences,"" said Santander UK's chief financial officer Antonio Roman. ""We are pleased
that our prudential regulator is comfortable with our capital plan and requires
no actions from us."" Mark Carney explained that a disorderly, no-deal Brexit would likely cause a ""supply shock"". ""It is a
totally different situation than people have been living with
and experiencing, certainly in advanced economies, for the last
30, 40 years,"" he said. ""In that situation, we would be faced with a real
challenge. ""There will be a negative shock to supply. Determining
exactly how much of it will be coming in, and at what pace, and
how persistent that is, will be difficult."" Mark Carney said that
survey's showed that less than half of businesses have initiated contingency
plans for a no-deal and less than a fifth of small businesses. Up to 250,000 traders have never competed a customs declaration form, he added. ""A sober objective assessment of the appropriate length
of the implementation period is desirable to get Brexit off to the right start,"" he said. ""This implementation period should be as long as necessary to prepare property
for the new trading relationships, but no longer"". Mark Carney is trying to reassure the public about the Bank of England's planning. He said the Bank was monitoring markets and indicated that the
bank was ready to lend to banks in the financial markets. He also indicated that banks might be allowed to hold less
capital if risks became too great. ""There's lots of issues people are concerned about but the one area they shouldn't have questions about is the financial system,"" said Mr Carney. ""The purpose of releasing the report is to provide that reassurance that even if this happens, even though it is not likely, the system is ready for it."" Accenture's head of finance and risk Peter Beardshaw thinks the BoE stress tests could be better. ""The
European stress tests earlier this month suggested certain weaknesses among UK banks, which could be
compounded by the uncertainty of Brexit,"" he said. ""In the
future, the Bank of Englandâs tests may
benefit from going
beyond capital strength and stress test key
areas of the overall
resilience agenda, including infrastructure and the
ability to fight cybercrime and money-laundering.â Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Bank of England governor Mark Carney has made it clear that the scenarios in the stress tests are not forecasts. However, even if the Bank is prepared, this isn't necessarily good news. ""To
be clear, the Bank being ready for Brexit is not sufficient to guarantee a particular
economic outcome,"" he told the press conference. ""There is little monetary policy can do to offset the
potentially significant hits to productivity and supply that Brexit could
entail, but the bank's unwavering commitment to price and financial stability
will support the necessary adjustment of the real economy. ""The future potential
of this economy and its implications for jobs, real wages and wealth are not
in the gift of central bankers."" The pound seems to be responding to comments from Bank of England governor Mark Carney. Sterling is now up 0.3% against the dollar at $1.2786. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Rape victim Sammy Woodhouse says she is ""constantly being re-victimised"" A victim of child sexual exploitation has called for a change in the law amid claims a man who raped her was offered a role in her son's life. It is understood Arshid Hussain, who was jailed for 35 years in 2016, was contacted by Rotherham Council about care proceedings heard last year. His victim Sammy Woodhouse told the BBC she was ""shocked"" when she was informed of the council's approach. The authority said it had ""no intention"" of putting a child at risk. Urgent efforts would be taken to ""address the failings in this case"", The MoJ said. Latest news from across Yorkshire Ms Woodhouse described Hussain as ""a danger to myself and to other children"". In a video posted on Twitter she urged the government ""to change the law to ensure rapists can't gain access to children conceived through rape"". 'What about my rights?' Hussain, known around Rotherham as Mad Ash, was one of three brothers behind the grooming and sexual abuse of more than 50 girls, including Ms Woodhouse. She was just 14 when she met him. Arshid Hussain was convicted of grooming and sexually abusing young girls in Rotherham Ms Woodhouse, who waived her anonymity in an effort to help other victims, said she thought when Hussain was jailed she could then get on with her life and would never hear from him again. Speaking on the Victoria Derbyshire programme, Ms Woodhouse said: ""We're constantly being re-victimised and as a rape victim I'm constantly told 'well actually, he's got his human rights'. ""What about my human rights?  What about other people's human rights and our children and our right to constantly have to keep our children safe?"" Ms Woodhouse, who now speaks about child sexual exploitation and her experiences, is calling for changes to the 1989 Children Act, alongside Sheffield Heeley MP Louise Haigh. Although Hussain has not made any application, Ms Woodhouse said it was important to get the law changed to protect others. ""This is happening all over the country, and it needs to stop,"" she added. Ms Woodhouse said her son was supporting her and had given his permission for her to speak out. According to The Times, the council had contacted Hussain and promised to keep him informed about future proceedings, after he was listed as a ""respondent"" in a Family Court case involving the boy. Solicitor Denise Lester, former chair of the Law Society's children law sub-committee, described it as ""a very, very difficult case"". ""The issue here is the law as it stands allows rapists and other abusers to participate in care and other public law proceedings She added: ""But, within that there are obviously procedures and decisions that would be made on a case by case basis by social workers to exclude a father or not"". By BBC Reality Check Legal guidelines in England and Wales state that all parents, regardless of parental responsibility, should be given notice of care proceedings. This means that by default, a convicted rapist does have the right to be notified of care proceedings involving his child. If they are married to their victim, men convicted of rape have parental responsibility and will automatically be a party in any court proceedings in which they will have their interests considered. That's the legal status that gives parents right to be given information about and be involved in important decisions affecting their child's upbringing. This doesn't mean they have any automatic rights to contact with their children however. Any application for access will assess the risk to a child and their welfare before allowing contact. Councils can apply to the court to make an exceptional order in order to avoid notifying a parent of care proceedings - although it's not guaranteed this application will be successful. These are usually only granted in cases where the child has no relationship with the father - such as in cases of stranger rape - or where there is a risk to the child, for example in cases of extreme domestic violence. In a statement, the authority said: ""We must be clear that at no stage has it been the intention of the council to put any child at risk, or to allow any convicted child sexual exploitation offender to have care of any child."" It was seeking clarification from the Ministry of Justice as to how legal directions relating to Family Court proceedings should be applied, it said. This was ""not just for Rotherham,"" it added, ""but to ensure that other councils across the country who may face similar issues are able to act with certainty and no more survivors of abuse have to experience further trauma"". A Ministry of Justice statement said: ""Local authorities can apply to courts to request permission not to notify parents without parental responsibility about care proceedings, and courts should consider the potential harm to the child and mother when making this decision."" It added: ""This is obviously a very distressing incident and the relevant departments and local authority will work urgently to understand and address the failings in this case.""

"Staff at Wazir Akbar Khan hospital treated the wounded At least 10 people have died and 19 were injured after a compound for British security firm G4S was attacked, authorities said. Gunmen stormed the compound after a car bomb was detonated outside, according to an Afghan interior ministry spokesman. A security source has told the BBC that foreigners were among the casualties. There was reportedly a heavy exchange of gunfire. The Taliban have claimed responsibility for the attack. While the interior ministry confirmed the death toll, it also warned the number could well rise. Why Afghanistan is more dangerous than ever Afghanistan profile - Timeline G4S, one of the world's largest security groups, helps guard the area around the British embassy.

""The situation is ongoing and we are co-ordinating with the Afghan authorities to bring it to a conclusion."" Authorities expect the number of casualties to rise Hafizullah, the father of three children wounded in a house near the compound, told Reuters news agency that the blast ""shattered"" all the doors of his home. ""There was a bang and right after that, all the windows and ceiling collapsed over the children,"" he said. The attack marked the latest violence to hit the Afghan capital.

"Carl Sargeant was found dead after an investigation was launched into his conduct A witness in the Carl Sargeant inquest may have lied to the coroner, the hearing has been told. Mr Sargeant, 49,was found hanged by his wife Bernadette on 7 November at his homein Connah's Quay, Flintshire. A statement from Flintshire council's deputy leader, Bernie Attridge, said he thought ""the sacking killed my friend"". But Cathy McGahey, counsel for Carwyn Jones, said it appeared Mr Attridge had some ""knowledge of behaviour that would have made Mr Sargeant anxious"". Mr Sargeant was found dead four days after he wassacked as communities minister by the first minister. The Labour AM had been accused of behaving inappropriately towards women, which he denied, and the inquest was told""tangible"" complaints were made weeks before he died. He left a letterapologising to his family and telling them: ""I have failed you."" Coroner John Gittins agreed to hear applications on the potential submission of new evidence which has come to light from witnesses including Flintshire council leader Aaron Shotton. Ms McGahey said: ""Mr Shotton has come forward with a witness statement that contradicts some of Mr Attridge's evidence. ""There is what appears to be a text message from Mr Attridge to Mr Shotton on November 1 2017... and it appears to refer to Mr Sargeant. ""Mr Attridge bets he is shitting bricks... He refers to MPs in Westminster being exposed and it won't be long before AMs are... on the hit list."" I failed you', Carl Sargeant told family 'Tangible' complaint made against Sargeant Carl Sargeant timeline Carl Sargeant: Profile of AM's career First Minister Carwyn Jones gave evidence to the inquest on Wednesday Ms McGahey said Mr Attridge went on to say, on 5 November, that rumours about Mr Sargeant were circulating in the Labour Club and he wanted to discourage people in the Labour group from saying anything in support of him. He then implied, she said, Mr Sargeant had done something ""that could lead to imprisonment"". ""Mr Attridge and Mr Attridge alone will know exactly what he meant by those,"" she told the coroner, before adding: ""It does appear on the face of it that Mr Attridge has not told you the truth. ""Signing the statement of truth when you know something you are saying is not true, is a contempt of court."" Mr Gittins heard applications from counsel relating to the submission of this new evidence, but he declined, saying he already had enough to do his job. Earlier, the inquest heard the first minister warned Mr Sargeant to ""be careful"" over conduct and drinking after an anonymous letter said he was ""not fit to be around women"". Leslie Thomas QC questioned Carwyn Jones on how Carl Sargeant's sacking was handled Speaking at the inquest in Ruthin, Denbighshire, on Wednesday, Mr Jones said he had received an anonymous letter in 2014 from someone in Mr Sargeant's Alyn and Deeside constituency. ""I remember the words 'he's not fit to be around women', but the letter was anonymous. I showed it to Carl,"" he told the hearing. Mr Jones said he told Mr Sargeant in 2014: ""You need to know... be careful, there's obviously someone who's watching you. ""Be careful how you conduct yourself and how much you drink."" He said Mr Sargeant ""wasn't an alcoholic"", but the company he kept was ""quite a hard-drinking bunch"". He told Mr Gittins the pair had known each other since 2001 and had ""never had a cross word"". Mr Jones did not know Mr Sargeant suffered from depression or had taken anti-depressants, the inquest heard. Carl Sargeant tweeted a statement after being sacked by the Welsh Government four days before he died. Asked when he first became aware of rumours about Mr Sargeant's conduct, he said: ""Rumours are plentiful in politics. Evidence is rare."" He did not know what the rumours were, but became aware of them on 18 October 2017, the day he held a meeting with senior advisors to discuss the cabinet reshuffle. One of two complainants who had made allegations about Mr Sargeant put it in writing to the Labour party in October, dating from an event in summer 2017. Pushed by the coroner why he had not spoken to Mr Sargeant, he said: ""Had I given him more details in terms of the allegations... he'd have known straight away, I suspect, who those people were and that was a risk I couldn't take."" He said ""the fact we had names"" meant there was ""an obligation to look further"". Mr Sargeant tweeted a statement on the afternoon he was sacked - highlighting that it related to personal conduct - and Mr Jones said there was ""no need to volunteer the information"". Mr Gittins responded: ""So that's what happens in politics? We keep secrets because it suits everybody to do so?"" ""It's not secrets. It's a gentler way of doing it,"" said Mr Jones. Carwyn Jones is stepping down as first minister in December Ahead of the meeting between the pair, Mr Jones said he had ""a feeling of dread going in that morning... I had lost sleep over it,"" but said it ""had to be done"". Mr Sargeant's response was ""curious"", and he said he ""did not recognise"" the allegations. ""In politics, that's not a denial,"" Mr Jones said. He was ""a little panicked but not distraught,"" but Mr Jones said there was ""no reason to doubt that he understood the implications"". He advised him to speak to his trade union for advice and ""keep your head down"". But following Mr Sargeant's tweet, he said the Welsh Government had to ""firefight"". ""The press would speculate. Twitter is corrosive,"" he added. ""Because of that tweet there was a media frenzy that made all manner of allegations about Carl that weren't true."" The inquest heard audio of Mr Jones speaking on a BBC Wales news broadcast on 6 November, the day before Mr Sargeant died. In it, Mr Jones used the words ""incidents"". The coroner asked him if he saw the difference between that and the word ""allegations"". ""It's quite clear from that news report that the news report is about allegations,"" he replied. Leslie Thomas QC is representing the Sargeant family Mr Jones had said the reshuffle happened on a Friday as Mr Sargeant had been away and if it was held mid-week he would not have had the support of his family on hand. Leslie Thomas QC, representing the Sargeant family, asked why it was necessary to draw Mr Sargeant's attention to the anonymous letter sent in 2014. Mr Jones felt it was right to let him know, as the letter had also been sent to Mrs Sargeant. He had not spoken to Mr Sargeant about a complaint from 2016 because ""the complainant didn't want me to"". The inquest heard Ann Jones AM acted in a liaison role between the Labour group and Mr Sargeant, and secondly in a pastoral role. Mr Jones said this happened on the afternoon following Mr Sargeant's dismissal and Ms Jones ""wanted to make sure that Carl was okay from a personal level as well"". Mr Jones planned to hold a reshuffle in November 2017 because he was in talks with an AM who had left his party, as well as wanting to offer new opportunities to others. During the course of the discussions, he received the written complaints about Mr Sargeant. Prior to that, Mr Jones characterised rumours about Mr Sargeant as ""tittle-tattle"", according to evidence from one of his special advisors. Mr Jones said the written allegations, which came just days before the reshuffle on 3 November, ""could not be ignored as part of the reshuffle process"". Mr Sargeant, who was being considered for the role of leader of the house, was sacked that day. Mr Jones confirmed it was ""wholly"" his responsibility who was appointed or moved and he had ""complete discretion"" over the cabinet. Earlier, Mr Jones' senior special advisor Matthew Greenough was recalled to the inquest to clarify some of the evidence he gave on Tuesday, around the timings of allegations made against Mr Sargeant. The ""tangible"" complaints referred to alleged incidents in summer 2017, made by women known in court as Miss A and Miss B. These were reported via the Labour Party to Mr Jones in October 2017. One of two women involved later made a written statement. There had previously been two separate allegations in 2016, although one was in the form of an anonymous letter. Mr Greenough agreed one allegation by a woman known as Miss C could have been made in 2015, but he did not know about it until 2016. He told the court he was present in the room when the reshuffle where Mr Sargeant lost his job took place and no information regarding any of the women was discussed in his presence. He told Mr Thomas he did not believe Mr Jones could have had a conversation with anyone without him knowing. Special advisor Jane Runeckles confirmed there were ""rumours"" about Mr Sargeant, but he was still in consideration for leader of the house at a meeting on 18 October 2017. Mr Sargeant's body was found in the utility room of his house in Connah's Quay The coroner said he struggled to understand how that might still be the case. ""The first minister was absolutely clear at that point that it was tittle-tattle. He had nothing to suggest otherwise,"" she replied. Mr Sargeant's sacking was precipitated by Mr Greenough receiving the written statement from one complainant on 1 November. Mr Gittins asked if that was ""the deciding factor in terms of his removal from office"", to which Ms Runeckles replied ""yes"", adding it would have been difficult to postpone a reshuffle. Mr Sargeant's brother Andy asked whether Ms Runeckles did anything to support him, and she said ""no"", explaining: ""The whim of the electorate is something [politicians] subject themselves to... you go into it knowing that this kind of thing can happen to you."" Mr Thomas repeatedly questioned Ms Runeckles over the 18 October meeting and any discussion of the rumours around Mr Sargeant, particularly in light of the #MeToo movement and ""political fallout"" in Westminster. She told the court she did not enquire where the rumours had come from and said they were ""not relevant"", which Mr Thomas challenged. She agreed she could have spoken to Mr Sargeant about the matter, but did not. Mr Thomas asked if the reshuffle was ""just a convenient way of trying to mask"" the situation surrounding Mr Sargeant. ""Absolutely not,"" she replied. The first minister was asked why, after allegations from Miss A and Miss B in 2017, Miss C - who made her original allegation in 2016 - was contacted to see if she wished to complain. He accused Mr Jones of ""setting the scene"" to ""get rid"" of Mr Sargeant. ""I could've removed Carl from the cabinet for no reason at all,"" Mr Jones responded. He said he felt it was right someone who had come forward in 2016 should now be asked if they wanted to make a complaint.

"A public records request led to the discovery of Ms Trump's personal email use US President Donald Trump's daughter and adviser Ivanka has defended her use of a personal email account, saying it was nothing like Hillary Clinton's. ""There's no equivalency,"" she said in an ABC interview aired on Wednesday. The first daughter came under fire this month when it emerged that she had used a private email to message officials on White House business last year. Mr Trump had lambasted his presidential opponent Mrs Clinton for her use of a private email server for official work. During his 2016 campaign, Mr Trump suggested the former secretary of state should be jailed after it emerged the FBI had found classified information in some emails from her private server. Chants of ""lock her up""were a mainstay at Mr Trump's rallies - but his daughter told ABC that her case was different. ""Everything has been preserved, everything has been archived,"" said Ms Trump, 37, who holds the official title of adviser to the president.

Last week, officials confirmed that Ms Trump had used a private email account to send hundreds of messages discussing official White House business. The White House responded by saying Ms Trump had done so before being briefed on the rules and had not sent any classified information. In Mrs Clinton's case, she had set up a private email server at her home in New York that she used for all work and personal emails during her four years as secretary of state.

"Stock photo - picture posed by model Just one in ten domestic violence refuge spaces in the UK is accessible to people with physical disabilities, a BBC investigation has found. Of the 131 councils that responded to a Freedom of Information request by BBC 100 Women, 20 had no accessible spaces. And only 11% of individual domestic violence spaces are fully accessible. It comes aftera report last week,externalsuggested women with disabilities are more likely to experience domestic violence than those without. The ONS report said 16.8% of women with long-term illness or disability were subjected to domestic abuse, compared to 6.3% of women without a disability. Domestic abuse can include physical, sexual or emotional abuse - as well as withdrawing care from people with long-term illnesses or disabilities. Sarah (not her real name) said she was repeatedly sexually abused by someone she thought was a friend. She said her physical disability added to her feelings of helplessness. ""I was just used and abused. When he was around me, everyone thought he was really nice, but they didn't know what was going on in the background,"" she said. ""If I hadn't had a disability, the situation probably never would have occurred. Because that first night I would have just jumped out of bed and gone 'on your bike'. ""I said 'enough' a number of times, but then he would still come round."" Those who work with disabled survivors say more funding is needed to improve the accessibility of refuges Domestic violence refuges provide a place for both women and men to flee violence. However, a Freedom of Information request by BBC 100 Women found only 11% of individual domestic violence spaces in the UK are fully accessible to survivors of abuse with physical disabilities. Others may be accessible to survivors with other types of disability. BBC 100 Women submitted FOI requests to 210 councils in the UK that provide refuge services, of which 131 responded. Some local authorities, including Carmarthenshire and Solihull, said all of their refuge spaces were accessible to people with a physical disability, but the majority said less than 20% of their spaces were. Twenty of the 131 councils that responded had no wheelchair accessible spaces, including the London Borough of Lambeth, which has 52 spaces. Bec - whose full name has been withheld to protect her clients - is a manager at one refuge that has been purpose built to accommodate disabled women, their children and sometimes a carer. She said: ""If we can't do something to try and create a space that welcomes those women, and keeps those women as equally safe as women without a disability, it was going to be a hugely missed opportunity."" Sue finds accessible spaces for disabled women through Women's Aid's ""No Women Turned Away"" project. ""Sometimes if you've worked with somebody for three, four weeks and you still haven't found anything and you're phoning up saying, 'ever so sorry, but there's no space again now'. ""It can be very upsetting."" Council funding for women's refuges has reduced by 6% overall in the last five years according to data from 144 out of 210 UK councils contacted. The largest cuts to council spending on domestic violence refuges were made by Southampton City Council, whose funding for domestic violence refuges has reduced by 65% since 2013/4. Other councils including Newcastle upon Tyne and Darlington have increased their spend on domestic violence refuges by more than 150%. Some refuges have been purpose built to accommodate disabled women and their children Government figures,externalshow an estimated 1.3 million women and 695,000 men in England and Wales experienced domestic abuse in the year ending March 2018. A Local Government Association spokesman said: ""Although [councils] have experienced significant budget reductions, they continue to work with other local partners to support victims. ""By 2020, councils will have lost almost 60p in every Â£1 they had from the government to spend on local services in 2010."" A government spokesperson said: ""We are providing Â£22m which will support more than 25,000 domestic abuse survivors across England.""

"This video can not be played Harry Leslie Smith: ""I am the world's oldest rebel"" He called himself the ""world's oldest rebel"", and at 95 years old World War Two veteran and political activist Harry Leslie Smith was still raging against the machine. Even shortly before his death - confirmed by his son on Wednesday- the activist was challenging the status quo. BBC News takes a look at his life and achievements. Mr Smith, pictured in his RAF uniform in 1941, served in WW2 The son of a miner, Mr Smith, from Barnsley, joined the RAF in 1941 and lived through the Great Depression. He became a passionate advocate for refugees, having seen the crisis at the end of World War Two. In a video shared by the UNHCR,external, the UN Refugee Agency - where he introduced himself as the ""world's oldest rebel"" - he recalled seeing ""a stream of hundreds of thousands of refugees coming south"". Holding back tears, he said: ""I can still see them. Absolutely pitiful, hungry, starving. ""When it was possible we would stop and give them whatever excess food supplies we had on our trucks and reassure them that now they were safe. ""I think for the first time I saw a gleam of hope in their faces."" Mr Smith had been one of the last remaining survivors of World War Two and the author of several books Toasting his 95th birthday earlier this year, Harry Leslie Smith vowed to ""see 100 and the end of Donald Trump"" Mr Smith, who in his later years divided his time between Yorkshire and Canada, where his son lives, would still regularly meet refugees from around the world and advocate on their behalf. On Twitter in October 2017,external, he said he was spending the last years of his life touring hotspots of the world ""to find a solution to the crisis"". Harry's Last Stand Refugee Tour, which he described as the ""last great challenge of my existence before old age consumes me"", raised more than Â£55,000 via a GoFundMe page. He shared their stories in books and wrote several other titles including Harry's Last Stand, Love Among the Ruins, 1923: A Memoir and The Empress of Australia. Mr Smith had served in the RAF as a wireless operator and in the final months of the conflict worked in mainland Europe, maintaining abandoned Nazi airfields for allied aircraft. While staying in Hamburg, he fell in love with local woman Friede, whichhe told the National Post in Canada,externalwas his ""destiny"". The couple married in 1947 and later moved to Canada together. Friede died in 1999 from cancer. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Earlier this yearMr Smith told the Canadian edition of Reader's Digest,externalhe was inspired to take up writing after seeing the world's economies crashing and the death in 2009 of his middle son at the age of 50. ""I needed to let people know that the economic and political storms coming our way, I'd seen them before,"" he said. When he was not campaigning against poverty, you might have heard Mr Smith talking about the NHS. Andy Burnham embraced Mr Smith after his passionate speech at the Labour Party conference in 2014 He rose to prominence after giving an impassioned speech about his life and the NHS at the Labour Party conference in 2014. Mr Smith lost his sister to tuberculosis when she was just 10 years old because his family could not afford a doctor. Thousands send support to ill war veteran 91-year-old prompts tears over NHS 'I didn't have a childhood' The speech, which moved some delegates to tears, earned him a standing ovation and huge praise on social media after warning that the UK must ""be vigilant"" about the NHS. Mr Smith also hit the headlines whenhe wrote in the Guardian in 2013,externalabout how he would wear the Remembrance poppy for the last time because he believed the symbol had become politicised. He said he could ""no longer allow my obligation as a veteran to remember those who died in the great wars to be co-opted by current or former politicians to justify our folly in Iraq, our morally dubious war on terror and our elimination of one's right to privacy"". He had recently had his own podcast, where he spoke out against austerity, neo-liberalism and ""the death of the welfare state at the hands of the entitled"". He also had more than 250,000 followers on his Twitter account, where in recent days his son had been posting updates about his father's health. After announcing his death on Twitter on Wednesday,his son John posted,externalhe was determined to follow in his father's footsteps and find a publisher for two other books about his early days.

"The families of the victims visited the site of the crash to pay tribute Indonesian investigators have said the Lion Air plane that crashed last month killing 189 people was not airworthy and should have been grounded. The Boeing 737 Max plane crashed into the Java Seashortly after departing from Jakarta on 29 October. A preliminary report has found technical problems had been reported on previous flights. The 737 Max is a new version of Boeing's original 737 and has become its fastest selling plane. The preliminary report details what is known by authorities about the short time the plane was in the air, but investigators said it did not give a definitive cause for the accident. The findings by the National Transport Safety Committee (KNKT) suggest that Lion Air put the plane back into service despite it having had problems on earlier flights. The pilots appeared to struggle with an automated system designed to keep the plane from stalling - a new feature in the 737 Max family. Anti-stall systems prevent a plane from pointing upwards at too high an angle, where it could lose its lift. However, during the 29 October flight, the plane's automatic anti-stalling system repeatedly forced the plane's nose down, even when the plane was not stalling - possibly due to a faulty sensor, the report said. Pilots tried to correct this by pointing the nose higher, until the system pushed it down again. This happened more than 20 times. The last moments before the Lion Air crash Victim's fiancÃ©e takes wedding photos alone Lion Air crash: Images of the unfolding tragedy Social media identifies crash couple It is unclear why the pilots did not employ procedures to disable the automated system. Nurcahyo Utomo, aviation head at the National Transport Safety Committee, said it was ""too early to conclude"" whether the anti-stall system had contributed to the crash. He added that the plane experienced similar problems during its previous flight from Denpasar in Bali to Jakarta. ""In our opinion, the plane was no longer airworthy and it should not have continued,"" he said. The committee's report itself, though, does not spell out that conclusion. The report said that Lion Air's safety culture should be improved and the airline should ensure the operations manual is followed ""in order to improve the safety culture"". It also says the carrier must ensure ""all operations documents are properly filled and documented"". In a statement, plane manufacturer Boeing said that it was ""deeply saddened"" by the loss of the Lion Air flight. ""As our customers and their passengers continue to fly the 737 Max to hundreds of destinations around the world every day, they have our assurance that the 737 Max is as safe as any airplane that has ever flown in the skies."" Boeing said that ""the appropriate procedure to address unintended horizontal stabiliser movement"" was contained in the relevant flight manuals. It said that the preliminary report showed that the correct procedures to counter the plane's nose being pushed down were carried out during the Denpasar flight the day before the crash. However, it was not clear if they procedures were followed during the 29 October flight that crashed, Boeing added. In an interview with the BBC, KNKT aviation head Nurcahyo Utomo appeared to dispute Boeing's account about the flight manuals. ""We haven't found the information in the manual relevant to the new feature to the 737- MAX, related to the feature for the stall prevention system,"" he said. Some pilots have also complained that they were not given all the relevant information about the differences between the latest anti-stall system, and older models, US media report. The plane was making a one-hour journey to the western city of Pangkal Pinang when it went down. The jet crashed following a request from the pilot for permission to turn back to the airport minutes after taking off from Jakarta. Investigators had previously revealed that the plane, on previous flights, had experienced technical problems related to airspeed and altitude readings. Therefore the ""angle-of-attack"" sensor, which contributes to those readings, had been changed the day before the crash. The plane's flight data recorder has been retrievedbut authorities are yet to locate the cockpit voice recorder which could provide more information about how the pilots reacted. Victims' families are suing Boeingover alleged faults with the jet's design, focusing on the automated safety feature. Rebecca Henschke, BBC Indonesia editor, Jakarta Rini Soegiyono's sister and brother-in-law were on the flight. After hearing the preliminary findings, she said she had mixed emotions. ""Sad, grieving, mourning, angry and disappointed - these are all the words that describe how I am feeling. But I am trying to be objective and strong."" She, like many grieving families, is mostly frustrated that the search for the remaining passengers has officially ended. ""There are still 64 families who haven't had their loved ones' remains identified and we have had to really push to get Lion Air and the authorities to search again for them. It's not good enough."" They want the airline to fund a search to find the remaining passengers as well as the cockpit voice recorder that hasn't been retrieved. It will be key, she says, to understanding what went wrong. ""We are watching and waiting to understand who is responsible. I know the world is also watching. It's important to know so it will not happen again. We don't want any family to have to go through what we are going through."" Budget airline Lion Air has in recent years risen to become a major player in South East Asia's low cost aviation sector. The airline, which also operates Batik Air and Wings Air, has a dubious safety record, though, and has had more accidents than other airlines in the country. Overall, Indonesia's aviation safety record has improved a lot since the days when even its national carrier Garuda was blacklisted from European and US airports over safety concerns.

"This video can not be played How Carlsen kept his World Chess Championship crown...after 50 hours! World number one Norwegian Magnus Carlsen has retained his World Chess Championship title, beating US opponent Fabiano Caruana in a tie-breaker event. He beat Caruana in three time-limited games, ending the American's hopes of becoming the first US champion since Bobby Fischer won in 1972. This showdown followed a new record, in which all 12 matches of regular play were drawn. Carlsen told the BBC that the win was ""huge for me"". ""Fabiano played very well and he's an extremely strong player so it's very special,"" he said. ""It was very tense for these whole three weeks and there was no point in particular where I felt I was going to win the match. I didn't particularly feel that I was losing it either. It was always hanging in the balance."" Caruana, however, told Norway's NRK TV that he had had a ""bad day"". ""I didn't even put up a fight,"" he said. Why is this year's World Chess Championship so exciting? Carlsen, who has won the championship three times before and was the favourite to win the game, took a two-match lead and needed only a draw in the third tie-breaker to seal his victory. But Caruana resigned in the third as it became increasingly clear the Norwegian would win. Players needed to win the best of four of these shortened games to take the title. Fabiano Caruana, right, is ranked number two in the world after Carlsen While there have been longer streaks of draws in chess, the lack of a win or loss in the entire championship battle set the new record. ""The match has made history, though of an ignoble kind,"" the World Chess broadcast's tournament report on the 12th and final regular game said, reflecting the frustration of some viewers after so many draws. Carlsen's tie-breaker victory came after he seemed to play for the tie-breaker event in the final regular game - drawing criticism from former world champion Garry Kasparov, who said the ""shocking draw offer"" showed he was ""losing his nerve"" and no longer favourite to win. Vladimir Kramnik, another Russian chess grandmaster, said: ""He might be tired of tension, fighting; maybe even of chess itself to a certain degree."" However,the Norwegian is ranked number one worldwide for fast-paced games,external, whereas Caruana is ranked at number 18. ""I'm a bit surprised that it's never occurred to anybody that I might know what's best for me,"" Carlsen told the BBC. ""It was a purely sporting decision and regardless of the result today I would have felt that it was the right one. After Carlsen's victory, Kasparov tweeted that his consistency was ""phenomenal"".

"Waves crash on rocks near Rue lighthouse on Rathlin Island Hundreds of homes were left without power and debris was strewn across coastal roads as much of NI endured the remnants of Storm Diana. The largest number of outages was in Castlederg, County Tyrone, where 200 customers were cut off. Northern Ireland Electricity (NIE) said the majority of affected customers had been reconnected. In Holywood, County Down, part of a coastal walkway between the Glen Road and Seafront Road collapsed. While the worst of the weather was over by Wednesday night, more heavy rain is expected during rush hour on Thursday morning. The remains of Storm Diana brought strong winds and heavy rain across many parts of the UK - Diana is not on the list of the Met Office's official storm names for this winter, and originated further south. Police warned of strong winds on the M1 from Belfast to Dungannon, and fallen trees were reported in counties Down and Tyrone. On the north coast, the A2 Garron Road was closed for a period in both directions from Carnlough to its junction with the Largy Road to enable boulders and debris which had been swept on to the road by the tide to be cleared.

"This video can not be played Rape victim Sammy Woodhouse says she is ""constantly being re-victimised"" A victim of child sexual exploitation has called for a change in the law amid claims a man who raped her was offered a role in her son's life. It is understood Arshid Hussain, who was jailed for 35 years in 2016, was contacted by Rotherham Council about care proceedings heard last year. His victim Sammy Woodhouse told the BBC she was ""shocked"" when she was informed of the council's approach. The authority said it had ""no intention"" of putting a child at risk. Urgent efforts would be taken to ""address the failings in this case"", The MoJ said. Latest news from across Yorkshire Ms Woodhouse described Hussain as ""a danger to myself and to other children"". In a video posted on Twitter she urged the government ""to change the law to ensure rapists can't gain access to children conceived through rape"". 'What about my rights?' Hussain, known around Rotherham as Mad Ash, was one of three brothers behind the grooming and sexual abuse of more than 50 girls, including Ms Woodhouse. She was just 14 when she met him. Arshid Hussain was convicted of grooming and sexually abusing young girls in Rotherham Ms Woodhouse, who waived her anonymity in an effort to help other victims, said she thought when Hussain was jailed she could then get on with her life and would never hear from him again. Speaking on the Victoria Derbyshire programme, Ms Woodhouse said: ""We're constantly being re-victimised and as a rape victim I'm constantly told 'well actually, he's got his human rights'. ""What about my human rights?  What about other people's human rights and our children and our right to constantly have to keep our children safe?"" Ms Woodhouse, who now speaks about child sexual exploitation and her experiences, is calling for changes to the 1989 Children Act, alongside Sheffield Heeley MP Louise Haigh. Although Hussain has not made any application, Ms Woodhouse said it was important to get the law changed to protect others. ""This is happening all over the country, and it needs to stop,"" she added. Ms Woodhouse said her son was supporting her and had given his permission for her to speak out. According to The Times, the council had contacted Hussain and promised to keep him informed about future proceedings, after he was listed as a ""respondent"" in a Family Court case involving the boy. Solicitor Denise Lester, former chair of the Law Society's children law sub-committee, described it as ""a very, very difficult case"". ""The issue here is the law as it stands allows rapists and other abusers to participate in care and other public law proceedings She added: ""But, within that there are obviously procedures and decisions that would be made on a case by case basis by social workers to exclude a father or not"". By BBC Reality Check Legal guidelines in England and Wales state that all parents, regardless of parental responsibility, should be given notice of care proceedings. This means that by default, a convicted rapist does have the right to be notified of care proceedings involving his child. If they are married to their victim, men convicted of rape have parental responsibility and will automatically be a party in any court proceedings in which they will have their interests considered. That's the legal status that gives parents right to be given information about and be involved in important decisions affecting their child's upbringing. This doesn't mean they have any automatic rights to contact with their children however. Any application for access will assess the risk to a child and their welfare before allowing contact. Councils can apply to the court to make an exceptional order in order to avoid notifying a parent of care proceedings - although it's not guaranteed this application will be successful. These are usually only granted in cases where the child has no relationship with the father - such as in cases of stranger rape - or where there is a risk to the child, for example in cases of extreme domestic violence. In a statement, the authority said: ""We must be clear that at no stage has it been the intention of the council to put any child at risk, or to allow any convicted child sexual exploitation offender to have care of any child."" It was seeking clarification from the Ministry of Justice as to how legal directions relating to Family Court proceedings should be applied, it said. This was ""not just for Rotherham,"" it added, ""but to ensure that other councils across the country who may face similar issues are able to act with certainty and no more survivors of abuse have to experience further trauma"". A Ministry of Justice statement said: ""Local authorities can apply to courts to request permission not to notify parents without parental responsibility about care proceedings, and courts should consider the potential harm to the child and mother when making this decision."" It added: ""This is obviously a very distressing incident and the relevant departments and local authority will work urgently to understand and address the failings in this case.""

"This video can not be played Why tensions between Russia and Ukraine are so high Russian President Vladimir Putin has accused Ukraine's leader, Petro Poroshenko, of trying to boost his ratings ahead of 2019 elections with a naval confrontation off Crimea. Russian FSB border guards opened fire on two Ukrainian gunboats and a tug before seizing the Ukrainian crews. ""He had to do something to make the situation more tense,"" Mr Putin told an investment forum on Wednesday. Ukraine has condemned the incident as a Russian ""act of aggression"". The EU has expressed ""utmost concern about the dangerous increase of tensions"" and said Russia's use of force was ""unacceptable"", but did not mention any new sanctions. Why Ukraine-Russia sea clash is fraught with risk At least three of the Ukrainian sailors were wounded on Sunday as tensions spilled over near in the Kerch Strait, the passage between the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov off the coast of Crimea. The peninsula was seized from Ukraine in 2014 and annexed by Russia shortly afterwards. The three boats were sailing from Odessa to Mariupol, a major Ukrainian port on the Azov sea, when they were confronted by four FSB vessels. Both countries agreed to share the sea in a 2003 treaty, but Russia's decision to open a bridge across the Kerch Strait this year has exacerbated tensions. Ukraine says Russia is deliberately blockading Mariupol and another port, Berdyansk, preventing ships from getting through the Kerch Strait. All 24 captured Ukrainian sailors have now been given two months in pre-trial detention by a court in Russian-annexed Crimea. ""It is undoubtedly a provocation,"" the Russian president said, adding that it was organised by Ukraine's authorities ""and, I think, the incumbent president in the run-up to the Ukrainian presidential election in March 2019"". Mr Poroshenko has low popularity ratings, with polls this month suggesting about 10% of voters plan to vote for him next year and nearly 50% sayingthey would not vote for him under any circumstances,external, the Kyiv Post newspaper reported. Mr Putin added that the Ukrainian president's decision to impose martial law after a mere ""border incident"" had not even taken place at the height of the conflict with pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine in 2014. He insisted that Russia's military response was appropriate as the Ukrainians had ""trespassed"" into Russia's territorial waters, arguing that even before Crimea was annexed they were Russian waters. Ukrainian officials published a map on Wednesday,external, placing all three Ukrainian boats just outside Crimea's territorial waters at the time they were seized. ""This political froth will die down,"" Mr Putin suggested, hours after Russia announced that it would send a new S-400 surface-to-air missile system to Crimea next month, to join the three already deployed this year. By Jonathan Marcus, defence and diplomatic correspondent For the Kremlin, this is as much a battle of narratives as a physical confrontation between patrol boats in the approaches to the Kerch Strait. Russia is asserting that the Ukrainians were engaged in a simple provocation. But a detailed narrative of events published by the Ukrainians, and reviewed by Western officials, suggests a very different story. The episode began in the early hours of the morning of 25 November with a Ukrainian gunboat calling up the Russian authorities and notifying them of its plans to pass into the Sea of Azov. The Ukrainian vessels were subsequently fired upon and seized some 18 hours later while returning to Odessa after abandoning their plans to transit the strait. Russia insists that law is on its side but the coast off Russia-annexed Crimea remains legally Ukrainian waters and the two countries have a longstanding agreement providing each with access to the Sea of Azov. Martial law is being implemented across Ukraine's border regions for 30 days in response to the crisis. The decision, backed by parliament, affects 10 Ukrainian border regions, and the Ukrainian leader made clear in a TV interview he thought the country was under threat of ""full-scale war with Russia"". The state border service said it had been put on full combat alert and a number of other potential restrictions could be imposed. This video can not be played Ukraine-Russia sea clash: Are Ukrainians worried? Mr Poroshenko initially called for a 60-day period of martial law but when domestic critics suggested he wanted to delay the March 2019 presidential vote he halved the period, so that ""it will not overlap for one day with the start of the election campaign"". By Jonah Fisher, Kiev Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko is talking up the possibility of war. In a series of media interviews with both international and domestic TV channels his message was clear: Russia is preparing an attack and Ukraine must get ready. It's hard for Mr Poroshenko to lose in that position. If war starts, he saw it coming. If it doesn't, his actions have averted it. Martial law has been introduced in the parts of the country closest to Russia. Declaring martial law sent a strong message but in practice it looks like changing very little on the ground. For now at least, border crossings remain open and life continues as normal. Western governments have backed the Ukrainian argument and US President Donald Trump has said he may cancel a planned meeting with Mr Putin on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Buenos Aires later this week. ""Maybe I won't even have the meeting. I don't like that aggression. I don't want that aggression at all,"" he told the Washington Post. Who controls the waters?

"Defending champion Carlsen, left, will hope to out-blitz challenger Caruana After nearly a month of fiercely contested play, the World Chess Championship is being decided in a series of fast-paced tie-breakers. Fabiano Caruana hopes to become the first US champion since Bobby Fischer in 1972 - but faces world number one Norwegian Magnus Carlsen in London. After 12 draws in 12 regular games, the pair now face ever-tighter time limits until a winner is decided on Wednesday. The ultimate decider could be the sudden death game called Armageddon. That will only happen if the evenly-matched grandmasters fail to eke out a decisive win for one of them, as the time on the clock is quickly pared down. Caruana and Carlsen are playing four games with just 25 minutes on each player's timer at the start and 10 seconds added per move. That is far less than in the games played so far, where they have had a generous hour to begin, with 50 minutes added at turn 40 and 30 seconds per move. If neither contestant comes out ahead after those games, the match format shifts to ""blitz"" chess - with just five minutes on the starting clock, and three seconds a move. Even for the world's two best players, the tight time pressure can lead to mistakes. They will play two games a match like this - up to a maximum of five matches if they keep drawing. Then comes Armageddon. 'Pawnographic' World Chess logo mocked Russian politician crowned world chess head The country breeding a generation of chess whizz kids The drawing of lots is crucial in this ""sudden death"" variant - the player with white pieces gets five minutes on the clock, and black receives only four. But black has his own advantage. If, despite the intense speed of the game, it once again ends in a draw, the player holding the black king is declared the winner - and the new world champion. Whoever is declared the winner will also take home a â¬1m (Â£880,000) cash prize. Despite his apparent slight advantage, Carlsen offered his opponent a draw in round 12 Defending champion Carlsen appeared to play deliberately for a tie-breaker scenario in the 12th and final game of regular play rather than risk defeat, despite an apparent positional advantage. ""Before the game he decided that draw was what he wanted and even when something more was possible he didn't want to go for it,""grandmaster Alex Colovic wrote in an analysis piece for Chess.com,external. The reason may be simple - whileCarlsen and Caruana are ranked numbers one and two in the world for regular play,,externalthat's not the case for fast-paced ""blitz"" chess. There,Carlsen remains the world's top-ranked player,external- but Caruana drops to spot number 18. It is not unreasonable for Carlsen to think he may have an advantage in the fast-paced tie-breakers, but victory is far from certain. After Monday's offer of a draw, former world champion Garry Kasparov tweeted that he thought the Norwegian was losing his nerve. Allow Twitter content?

"Carl Sargeant was found dead after an investigation was launched into his conduct A witness in the Carl Sargeant inquest may have lied to the coroner, the hearing has been told. Mr Sargeant, 49,was found hanged by his wife Bernadette on 7 November at his homein Connah's Quay, Flintshire. A statement from Flintshire council's deputy leader, Bernie Attridge, said he thought ""the sacking killed my friend"". But Cathy McGahey, counsel for Carwyn Jones, said it appeared Mr Attridge had some ""knowledge of behaviour that would have made Mr Sargeant anxious"". Mr Sargeant was found dead four days after he wassacked as communities minister by the first minister. The Labour AM had been accused of behaving inappropriately towards women, which he denied, and the inquest was told""tangible"" complaints were made weeks before he died. He left a letterapologising to his family and telling them: ""I have failed you."" Coroner John Gittins agreed to hear applications on the potential submission of new evidence which has come to light from witnesses including Flintshire council leader Aaron Shotton. Ms McGahey said: ""Mr Shotton has come forward with a witness statement that contradicts some of Mr Attridge's evidence. ""There is what appears to be a text message from Mr Attridge to Mr Shotton on November 1 2017... and it appears to refer to Mr Sargeant. ""Mr Attridge bets he is shitting bricks... He refers to MPs in Westminster being exposed and it won't be long before AMs are... on the hit list."" I failed you', Carl Sargeant told family 'Tangible' complaint made against Sargeant Carl Sargeant timeline Carl Sargeant: Profile of AM's career First Minister Carwyn Jones gave evidence to the inquest on Wednesday Ms McGahey said Mr Attridge went on to say, on 5 November, that rumours about Mr Sargeant were circulating in the Labour Club and he wanted to discourage people in the Labour group from saying anything in support of him. He then implied, she said, Mr Sargeant had done something ""that could lead to imprisonment"". ""Mr Attridge and Mr Attridge alone will know exactly what he meant by those,"" she told the coroner, before adding: ""It does appear on the face of it that Mr Attridge has not told you the truth. ""Signing the statement of truth when you know something you are saying is not true, is a contempt of court."" Mr Gittins heard applications from counsel relating to the submission of this new evidence, but he declined, saying he already had enough to do his job. Earlier, the inquest heard the first minister warned Mr Sargeant to ""be careful"" over conduct and drinking after an anonymous letter said he was ""not fit to be around women"". Leslie Thomas QC questioned Carwyn Jones on how Carl Sargeant's sacking was handled Speaking at the inquest in Ruthin, Denbighshire, on Wednesday, Mr Jones said he had received an anonymous letter in 2014 from someone in Mr Sargeant's Alyn and Deeside constituency. ""I remember the words 'he's not fit to be around women', but the letter was anonymous. I showed it to Carl,"" he told the hearing. Mr Jones said he told Mr Sargeant in 2014: ""You need to know... be careful, there's obviously someone who's watching you. ""Be careful how you conduct yourself and how much you drink."" He said Mr Sargeant ""wasn't an alcoholic"", but the company he kept was ""quite a hard-drinking bunch"". He told Mr Gittins the pair had known each other since 2001 and had ""never had a cross word"". Mr Jones did not know Mr Sargeant suffered from depression or had taken anti-depressants, the inquest heard. Carl Sargeant tweeted a statement after being sacked by the Welsh Government four days before he died. Asked when he first became aware of rumours about Mr Sargeant's conduct, he said: ""Rumours are plentiful in politics. Evidence is rare."" He did not know what the rumours were, but became aware of them on 18 October 2017, the day he held a meeting with senior advisors to discuss the cabinet reshuffle. One of two complainants who had made allegations about Mr Sargeant put it in writing to the Labour party in October, dating from an event in summer 2017. Pushed by the coroner why he had not spoken to Mr Sargeant, he said: ""Had I given him more details in terms of the allegations... he'd have known straight away, I suspect, who those people were and that was a risk I couldn't take."" He said ""the fact we had names"" meant there was ""an obligation to look further"". Mr Sargeant tweeted a statement on the afternoon he was sacked - highlighting that it related to personal conduct - and Mr Jones said there was ""no need to volunteer the information"". Mr Gittins responded: ""So that's what happens in politics? We keep secrets because it suits everybody to do so?"" ""It's not secrets. It's a gentler way of doing it,"" said Mr Jones. Carwyn Jones is stepping down as first minister in December Ahead of the meeting between the pair, Mr Jones said he had ""a feeling of dread going in that morning... I had lost sleep over it,"" but said it ""had to be done"". Mr Sargeant's response was ""curious"", and he said he ""did not recognise"" the allegations. ""In politics, that's not a denial,"" Mr Jones said. He was ""a little panicked but not distraught,"" but Mr Jones said there was ""no reason to doubt that he understood the implications"". He advised him to speak to his trade union for advice and ""keep your head down"". But following Mr Sargeant's tweet, he said the Welsh Government had to ""firefight"". ""The press would speculate. Twitter is corrosive,"" he added. ""Because of that tweet there was a media frenzy that made all manner of allegations about Carl that weren't true."" The inquest heard audio of Mr Jones speaking on a BBC Wales news broadcast on 6 November, the day before Mr Sargeant died. In it, Mr Jones used the words ""incidents"". The coroner asked him if he saw the difference between that and the word ""allegations"". ""It's quite clear from that news report that the news report is about allegations,"" he replied. Leslie Thomas QC is representing the Sargeant family Mr Jones had said the reshuffle happened on a Friday as Mr Sargeant had been away and if it was held mid-week he would not have had the support of his family on hand. Leslie Thomas QC, representing the Sargeant family, asked why it was necessary to draw Mr Sargeant's attention to the anonymous letter sent in 2014. Mr Jones felt it was right to let him know, as the letter had also been sent to Mrs Sargeant. He had not spoken to Mr Sargeant about a complaint from 2016 because ""the complainant didn't want me to"". The inquest heard Ann Jones AM acted in a liaison role between the Labour group and Mr Sargeant, and secondly in a pastoral role. Mr Jones said this happened on the afternoon following Mr Sargeant's dismissal and Ms Jones ""wanted to make sure that Carl was okay from a personal level as well"". Mr Jones planned to hold a reshuffle in November 2017 because he was in talks with an AM who had left his party, as well as wanting to offer new opportunities to others. During the course of the discussions, he received the written complaints about Mr Sargeant. Prior to that, Mr Jones characterised rumours about Mr Sargeant as ""tittle-tattle"", according to evidence from one of his special advisors. Mr Jones said the written allegations, which came just days before the reshuffle on 3 November, ""could not be ignored as part of the reshuffle process"". Mr Sargeant, who was being considered for the role of leader of the house, was sacked that day. Mr Jones confirmed it was ""wholly"" his responsibility who was appointed or moved and he had ""complete discretion"" over the cabinet. Earlier, Mr Jones' senior special advisor Matthew Greenough was recalled to the inquest to clarify some of the evidence he gave on Tuesday, around the timings of allegations made against Mr Sargeant. The ""tangible"" complaints referred to alleged incidents in summer 2017, made by women known in court as Miss A and Miss B. These were reported via the Labour Party to Mr Jones in October 2017. One of two women involved later made a written statement. There had previously been two separate allegations in 2016, although one was in the form of an anonymous letter. Mr Greenough agreed one allegation by a woman known as Miss C could have been made in 2015, but he did not know about it until 2016. He told the court he was present in the room when the reshuffle where Mr Sargeant lost his job took place and no information regarding any of the women was discussed in his presence. He told Mr Thomas he did not believe Mr Jones could have had a conversation with anyone without him knowing. Special advisor Jane Runeckles confirmed there were ""rumours"" about Mr Sargeant, but he was still in consideration for leader of the house at a meeting on 18 October 2017. Mr Sargeant's body was found in the utility room of his house in Connah's Quay The coroner said he struggled to understand how that might still be the case. ""The first minister was absolutely clear at that point that it was tittle-tattle. He had nothing to suggest otherwise,"" she replied. Mr Sargeant's sacking was precipitated by Mr Greenough receiving the written statement from one complainant on 1 November. Mr Gittins asked if that was ""the deciding factor in terms of his removal from office"", to which Ms Runeckles replied ""yes"", adding it would have been difficult to postpone a reshuffle. Mr Sargeant's brother Andy asked whether Ms Runeckles did anything to support him, and she said ""no"", explaining: ""The whim of the electorate is something [politicians] subject themselves to... you go into it knowing that this kind of thing can happen to you."" Mr Thomas repeatedly questioned Ms Runeckles over the 18 October meeting and any discussion of the rumours around Mr Sargeant, particularly in light of the #MeToo movement and ""political fallout"" in Westminster. She told the court she did not enquire where the rumours had come from and said they were ""not relevant"", which Mr Thomas challenged. She agreed she could have spoken to Mr Sargeant about the matter, but did not. Mr Thomas asked if the reshuffle was ""just a convenient way of trying to mask"" the situation surrounding Mr Sargeant. ""Absolutely not,"" she replied. The first minister was asked why, after allegations from Miss A and Miss B in 2017, Miss C - who made her original allegation in 2016 - was contacted to see if she wished to complain. He accused Mr Jones of ""setting the scene"" to ""get rid"" of Mr Sargeant. ""I could've removed Carl from the cabinet for no reason at all,"" Mr Jones responded. He said he felt it was right someone who had come forward in 2016 should now be asked if they wanted to make a complaint.

"Elisabeth Moss (left) stars in the TV adaptation of Atwood's landmark novel Margaret Atwood is writing a sequel to her novel The Handmaid's Tale, inspired by the state of the modern world. The landmark 1985 book, about life under a totalitarian regime in the US, became a hit TV drama in 2017. In a message, Atwood wrote: ""Dear Readers, everything you've ever asked me about Gilead and its inner workings is the inspiration for this book. ""Well, almost everything! The other inspiration is the world we've been living in."" The sequel, to be titled The Testaments, will be published on 10 September 2019. The Canadian author said it would be set 15 years after the end of the original book, which has become a feminist classic, and would be narrated by three female characters. She didn't mention President Trump, but the press release noted that The Handmaid's Tale had become ""a symbol of the movement against him, standing for female empowerment and resistance in the face of misogyny and the rolling back of women's rights around the world"". The original book told of Offred, one of many women who have been stripped of their previous identities and rights and forced into sexual servitude by the commanders of the Gilead regime. The main part of the novel ended with her being taken away in a van by people she is told are members of the underground resistance. Readers of the sequel will hope to find out whether she was smuggled to freedom, or taken for imprisonment and punishment. Becky Hardie, deputy publishing director of UK publishers Chatto & Windus, said: ""As a society, we've never needed Margaret Atwood more. Two series of The Handmaid's Tale have so far been broadcast ""The moment the van door slams on Offred's future at the end of The Handmaid's Tale is one of the most brilliantly ambiguous endings in literature. I cannot wait to find out what's been going on in Atwood's Gilead - and what that might tell us about our own times."" Atwood has not revealed whether Offred - or any of the original book's characters - will be among the sequel's three narrators. Many fans have been struggling to contain their excitement.

New Zealand government's move to prevent Huawei supplying a local mobile network with 5G equipment has raised questions about why the UK appears less concerned about use of the Chinese company's technology. The US and Australia had already closed the door on Huawei's involvement in their next-generation mobile networks. That means three members of the Five Eyes intelligence alliance have now acted against the Shenzhen-based company. And one other member, Canada,is carrying out a security review of its own,external. So, there's a prospect that the UK could soon be the sole holdout, allowing Huawei to play a key role in delivering the data that everything from self-driving cars to smart city sensors will rely on.

Wall Street shares have ended higher after Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell's remarks to the New York Economic Club suggesting that interest rates might not rise too much further. TheDow Jones Industrial Averageclosed 2.5% ahead at 25,366. TheS&P 500ended 2.3% up at 2,742. And finally, the tech-heavyNasdaqfinished 3% higher at 7,292. Barclays says it passed the Bank of England's stress tests with a 8.9% minimum stressed transitional common equity tier 1 ratio, after taking account of strategic management actions, which is above the stress test hurdle rate of 7.9%. As a result, Barclays intends to pay its shareholders a 2018 dividend of 6.5p, subject to regulatory approvals. Dave LeeNorth America technology reporter Mark Luckie left Facebook in early November When it rains, it pours - and Facebookâs utterly sodden year continues to be flooded by accusations of bad governance. Mark Luckie, a black, former Facebook employee whose job it was to handle the firmâs relationship with âinfluencersâ, put it quite plainly: âFacebook has a black people problem.â His 2,500-word note, posted on Tuesday, outlines what he sees as a culture that talks about inclusion, but does not practise it. In some buildings at the company, Mr Luckie said, there were âmore âBlack Lives Matterâ posters than there are actual black peopleâ. Read more here. Big four accounting firm KPMG says that the Bank of England has clearly taken British banks ""off the European naughty step"", but if you look into the detail of the Bank of England's stress test results, it's not as rosy as things seem. âOur banks are very well capitalised, but, the
impact of the accounting standard, IFRS9, was keenly felt under these
scenarios. When you look at the results in light of a âfully loadedâ IFRS9, two
banks fall well below the âpass markâ with their capital severely depleted,"" said KPMG UK's banking partner Rob Smith. âDespite, once again, the banks all passing,
investors and bank staff may be unnerved when they delve into the detail.
Dividend payments drop to almost zero from Â£28 billion, meanwhile bonuses fall
from Â£11bn to just over Â£1bn over the first two years of the stress. âFurther, the Bank of England raised several issues
with the models used to perform the tests including a lack of understanding by
Board members. This could cause some to question how reliable the results
actually are.â US financial markets have risen sharply. Why? Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has signalled that the Federal Reserve may not raise interest rates much more -  a boon for share prices which typically fall as interest rates rise. In a speech in New York, Mr Powell said interest rates are ""just below the broad range of estimates of the level that would be neutral for the economy - that is, neither speeding up nor slowing down growth."" Last month, Mr Powell said the bank was a ""long way"" from neutral. But he may be trying to project a softer tone after repeated criticism from US President Donald Trump about the Fed's plans to raise rates. Chair of the pro-Brexit
European Research Group Jacob Rees-Mogg is not impressed with Mark Carney today. âThe Bank of England is meant to
be a cautious and dignified body - not one that gives out hysterical
statements,"" he said in the House of Commons. âWhat theyâve said today lacks all credibility and is a
regurgitation of project fear to come project hysteria. âI think it discredits the governor - who is basically a
failed second rate Canadian politician who is talking down the pound which I
think is unprecedented.â Prominent Brexiteer and former Tory leader Iain Duncan
Smith agrees. He told the BBC: âThe bottom line of both sets of reports is that project
fear like Frankensteinâs monster has been resuscitated and is stalking the
land.â Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has said,externalthat rising levels of corporate debt are a risk to investors - but not yet to wider financial stability. However, his remarks about corporate debt made it clear that he views it as a greater risk than other factors, such as financial markets, bank stability and consumer borrowing. He said business borrowing presents a ""subtler story"" than other areas of the economy like household debt, later adding: ""There are reasons for concern.""

The Bank of England isn't the only body out there worried about Brexit. The US central bank has also flagged the disruption caused by the UK's exit from the European Union as a risk to the American economy. The topic is mentioned in the Federal Reserve's newfinancial stability report,externaland ina speech in New York on Wednesday,external, Fed Chair Jerome Powell called the event a good example of a potential ""trigger"" for financial distress in the US. Accountancy giant PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) says that British banks have actually become more resilient than last year. ""The Bank of England stress test results show that the major UK banks can withstand an extreme stress, akin to a
âdisorderlyâ Brexit, and, crucially, can continue to support their
customers. In comparison to the 2017 stress test, the major UK banks have
increased their resilience to an extreme economic shock, as well as
increased the tools at managements' disposal to recover from a downturn,"" said PwC stress testing leader and partner Raf Hussain. ""Key actions included curtailing of dividends and conversion
of additional Tier 1 capital for some banks. The Prudential Regulation
Authority also noted that some banks had made improvements in their analysis
and submission. ""However, further work could be required to improve their model
risk management for stress testing."" Santander UK has reminded us that for the third year in a row, it had the lowest stressed common equity tier 1 capital ratio impact of all the banks stress tested by the Bank of England. ""The PRA has examined extreme but
plausible stress scenarios for the UK economy and has found that Santander UK
has more than adequate capital to withstand such occurrences,"" said Santander UK's chief financial officer Antonio Roman. ""We are pleased
that our prudential regulator is comfortable with our capital plan and requires
no actions from us."" Mark Carney explained that a disorderly, no-deal Brexit would likely cause a ""supply shock"". ""It is a
totally different situation than people have been living with
and experiencing, certainly in advanced economies, for the last
30, 40 years,"" he said. ""In that situation, we would be faced with a real
challenge. ""There will be a negative shock to supply. Determining
exactly how much of it will be coming in, and at what pace, and
how persistent that is, will be difficult."" Mark Carney said that
survey's showed that less than half of businesses have initiated contingency
plans for a no-deal and less than a fifth of small businesses. Up to 250,000 traders have never competed a customs declaration form, he added. ""A sober objective assessment of the appropriate length
of the implementation period is desirable to get Brexit off to the right start,"" he said. ""This implementation period should be as long as necessary to prepare property
for the new trading relationships, but no longer"". Mark Carney is trying to reassure the public about the Bank of England's planning. He said the Bank was monitoring markets and indicated that the
bank was ready to lend to banks in the financial markets. He also indicated that banks might be allowed to hold less
capital if risks became too great. ""There's lots of issues people are concerned about but the one area they shouldn't have questions about is the financial system,"" said Mr Carney. ""The purpose of releasing the report is to provide that reassurance that even if this happens, even though it is not likely, the system is ready for it."" Accenture's head of finance and risk Peter Beardshaw thinks the BoE stress tests could be better. ""The
European stress tests earlier this month suggested certain weaknesses among UK banks, which could be
compounded by the uncertainty of Brexit,"" he said. ""In the
future, the Bank of Englandâs tests may
benefit from going
beyond capital strength and stress test key
areas of the overall
resilience agenda, including infrastructure and the
ability to fight cybercrime and money-laundering.â Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

be clear, the Bank being ready for Brexit is not sufficient to guarantee a particular

potentially significant hits to productivity and supply that Brexit could
entail, but the bank's unwavering commitment to price and financial stability
will support the necessary adjustment of the real economy. ""The future potential
of this economy and its implications for jobs, real wages and wealth are not

"A disorderly Brexit - with no deal and no transition period - could, in a worst-case scenario, deliver a severe economic shock to the economy, triggering a worse recession than we saw after the financial crisis, with the economy shrinking by 8%. House prices could fall by 30%, commercial property by 48%. Unemployment nearly doubles, the value of the pound could fall by a quarter, which would push up the price of imported goods, and see inflation rise by 6.5%. That could prevent the Bank from lowering interest rates to help the economy - in fact interest rates might rise to 4% to tackle inflation. Holy cow - so far so bad. But wait. The bank also said today in itsFinancial Stability Report,externalthat a close economic partnership after Brexit between the UK and the EU with zero friction at the border could see the UK economy boosted by up to 1.75% compared to current estimates as uncertainty lifted and confidence returned. That doesn't appear to be on the table if you read the recent deal signed by the EU 27. A more realistic assumption perhaps is a trade deal based on the one Canada has with the EU which involves some non-tariff barriers at or behind the border. Not entirely frictionless - but Canada plus. On this basis, the bank thinks the UK economy will be between 1.25% and 3.75% lower in five years time than it would otherwise have been. The government's own assessment was that kind of scenario would leave the UK economy between 2.5 and 3.9% smaller by 2035 than if we'd stayed in the EU. To argue the toss over half a percent here when comparing highly uncertain scenario analyses over long and different time scales like these is pretty pointless. But the broad outlook from both the government and the Bank is similar. Almost every plausible scenario makes the UK worse off than it would have been if it had stayed in the EU. According to the Bank - the worst outcome is worse than the government thinks, and the best likely outcome is less bad. Its important to remember these are scenarios - not forecasts of what will happen to the economy. That gets affected by loads of other factors like trade wars, real wars, technology, natural disasters and so on, but in looking at the possible impact of a no-deal Brexit, the bank has in some ways come to the Prime Minister's aid. The difference between her Brexit and no deal is very wide indeed. Her deal is not good, but its not that bad and no deal could be positively ugly. Correction 26 March 2019: This article has been amended to make clear that in a worst-case scenario one of the consequences of a Brexit with no deal and no transition period could include the economy shrinking by 8%, according to the Bank of England.

"The UK will be poorer economically under any form of Brexit, compared with staying in the EU, new government analysis suggests. Official figures say the UK economy could be up to 3.9% smaller after 15 years under Theresa May's Brexit plan, compared with staying in the EU. But a no-deal Brexit could deliver a 9.3% hit, the new estimates say. The prime minister said her deal was the best one available for jobs and the economy. ""Our deal is the best deal available for jobs and our economy, that allows us to honour the referendum and realise the opportunities of Brexit,"" Mrs May said at Prime Minister's Questions. The government's Brexit deal faces a potentially difficult vote in the House of Commons on 11 December. Before that Mrs May is touring the country to promote the deal and was due to be in Scotland on Wednesday afternoon. Reality Check: Can forecasts get it wrong? May defends Brexit deal Davis attacks 'flawed' Brexit forecasts A guide to where we are with Brexit Reality Check: Is Trump right about the Brexit deal? Confusinglythe 83-page document does not,externalforecast the impact of the prime minister's current deal. Instead it looks at the potential impact of the proposals agreed by the Cabinet at Chequers in July, which is the basis of the current proposal. Under those circumstances the economy would be 3.9% smaller than if the UK had remained part of the European Union. The estimates do not put a cash figure on the potential impact on the economy, but independent experts have said that 3.9% of GDP would equate to about Â£100bn a year by the 2030s. The government report also examines three other possible scenarios including a no-deal Brexit, which would be the most damaging. The economy will continue to grow under all the scenarios, but there is a wide variation in how much. Former Brexit Secretary David Davis questioned the research, saying previous Treasury forecasts had been proved wrong and were based on ""flawed assumptions"". Chancellor Philip Hammond said the planned Brexit deal combined most of the economic benefits of remaining in the EU with the political benefits of leaving the EU. Asked if the UK would be poorer under Mrs May's deal, he said: ""The economy will be slightly smaller in the prime minister's preferred version of the future partnership."" But Mr Hammond argued that staying in the EU was not politically ""viable"". Veteran Conservative Eurosceptic Sir Bill Cash said Mr Hammond was effectively arguing for the UK to stay in the European Union in his ""extraordinary"" statement. He said the chancellor had ignored potential economic benefits of leaving the EU, asking: ""What about the trade deals which could give us the most enormous opportunities throughout the world, if we are able to strike them?"" Under Mrs May's deal, the UK would be able to negotiate trade deals during the transition period after 29 March's Brexit day, but would not be able to implement them until the end of the planned 21-month transition period, which could itself be extended. By Andrew Walker, BBC economics correspondent This exercise doesn't predict how much the economy will grow over the 15-year period, but rather the impact of specific changes in Britain's trade relationships, other things being equal. That is after all the question we want answered. One problem is that it will be harder to judge when we look back whether the figures were right, because we would be comparing what actually happened with a hypothetical alternative that didn't. The same applies to the impact on the government's finances. That said, all the scenarios in the analysis show an adverse effect; the saving on contributions to the EU is more than offset by the lower tax revenues that would result from the weaker economic growth. There are also some striking differences in regional economic impacts. In the no-deal situation the biggest effects are in North East England and the West Midlands. London gets away with least damage in that situation, but the capital is worst hit in the government's preferred option. That is because London specialises in services that would gain less, compared to no deal, than manufacturing from the relationship the government is seeking to negotiate.

"This video can not be played John McDonnell: ""If we canât get a general election then the other option which weâve kept on the table is a peopleâs vote"" Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has suggested it is ""inevitable"" another EU referendum will be called if Labour are not able to force a general election. An election remains Labour's preferred option if - as is widely expected - MPs vote down Theresa May's Brexit deal on 11 December. The shadow chancellor said forcing an election would be ""very difficult"". And if it was not possible, he told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg, the party would push for another referendum. Labour, the Brexit vote. And what next? Brexit will make UK worse off, government warns Labour 'could form minority government' Brexit vote will be honoured, says Abbott Mr McDonnell told the BBC's political editor: ""We want a deal that will protect jobs and the economy. ""If we can't achieve that - the government can't achieve that - we should have a general election, but that's very difficult to do because of the nature of the legislation that David Cameron brought forward. ""If that's not possible, we'll be calling upon the government then to join us in a public vote. It's difficult to judge each stage, but that's the sequence I think that we'll inevitably go through over this period."" Asked by Laura Kuenssberg if a vote of no confidence did not bring down the government and lead to a general election, a second referendum was ""inevitable"", Mr McDonnell replied: ""That's right. ""Our policy is if we can't get a general election, then the other option which we've kept on the table is a people's vote."" Asked about shadow home secretary Diane Abbott's claim that the Leave side could win another referendum, he said: ""It might do. It's very difficult to call at the moment."" He said most of the Labour MPs campaigning for another referendum were the ""strongest Remainers"". ""So, the caution for them and for all of us, whichever argument you put, is the people will decide. As we saw in the last referendum, it's very difficult to predict which way the people will decide on this. ""I've seen a lot of polls that have said there has been a shift from Leave to Remain. I've also seen other polls saying actually we're just about the same as we were then."" A guide to where we are with Brexit What happens if MPs reject Brexit deal? He said he had voted Remain in the 2016 EU referendum and he believed it was still the ""best option"" but he also respected ""the wishes of the people"". If there were to be another referendum, he said, there would be a ""debate"" in the Labour Party about its position but it could not support Theresa May's ""current"" deal, if that were on the ballot paper. Prime Minister Theresa May, who is Conservative Party leader, said that Mr McDonnell's comments about another referendum showed that ""the true Labour position"" was that they want to ""frustrate Brexit"". Speaking in Scotland, the prime minister said another referendum would be a ""betrayal of the vote of the British people"" adding that the Government had negotiated a deal that ""delivers Brexit"" while ""protecting jobs, protecting livelihoods, protecting security and protecting our United Kingdom"". A fresh referendum could be held only if the government legislates for one and a majority in the Commons supports it. Theresa May has faced repeated calls to hold another referendum from Labour, Lib Dem, SNP, Green and a small number of Conservative MPs, who are members of the People's Vote campaign, but has always rejected them. Under the Fixed-Term Parliament Act, introduced in 2011 by David Cameron's coalition government, a general election can be called if two-thirds of MPs vote for one.

"This video can not be played David Davis: ""The future of the UK economy does not lie with the EU, but with the wider world."" Former Brexit Secretary David Davis has attacked government estimates that show leaving the EU will make the UK worse off - calling it ""project fear 2.0"" The Tory backbencher said forecasts by the Treasury are often proved ""wrong"" and are based on ""flawed assumptions"". He again called for MPs to reject Theresa May's ""bogus"" Brexit deal. The Treasury says the economy could be up to 3.9% smaller after 15 years Mrs May's plan, compared with staying in the EU. But they claim a no-deal Brexit could deliver a 9.3% hit. Chancellor Philip Hammond said the deal was not just about the economy, but would deliver ""political benefits"". Brexit will make UK worse off, government warns Reality Check: What is an economic forecast? A guide to where we are with Brexit Speaking at an event held by the Economists for Free Trade in London, Mr Davis, who quit the cabinet over Mrs May's Brexit plans, said the government figures were part of a ""propaganda onslaught"" ahead of a vote on the deal on 11 December. He said: ""Treasury forecasts in the past have almost never been right and have more often been dramatically wrong."" Mr Davis said predictions that the economy in the UK would contract by 2.1% in the 18 months after the referendum were unfounded - in fact it grew by 2.8% - along with other concerns around unemployment and incomes. ""None of this spine-chilling nonsense came to pass,"" he said. The prominent Brexiteer also used his speech to continue his criticism of Mrs May's withdrawal agreement for leaving the EU and the political declaration for the future relationship. He said that it would leave the UK subject to EU single market rules and ""annexes"" Northern Ireland. Any MP voting in support of the PM's deal would ""repudiate"" the wishes of the public and cause ""incalculable"" damage to the country's democracy, Mr Davis added. And he claimed it would also deprive the UK of the ""chief economic benefits"" of Brexit by stopping it from negotiating free trade deals around the world. But Mr Davis had no fear around leaving with a no deal and reverting to World Trade Organisation rules, saying it would ""involve all the choking tentacles of the EU falling away"". ""The future of the UK economy does not lie with the EU but with the wider world,"" he said. The government earlier published a 83-page document on the long-term economic impact of Brexit on the UK,external. It compares the likely impact of Mrs May's deal with the alternative scenarios of Norway-style membership of the European Economic Area, a Canada-style free trade agreement with the EU and a no-deal Brexit. It says that GDP will be lower in 15 years under all Brexit scenarios than it would be with EU membership. And in all cases, national income will be reduced if migration from Europe is reduced from its current levels. But Chancellor Philip Hammond said that staying in the EU was not politically ""viable"".

"There is a ""real prospect"" of ""major disruption"" at UK ports in the case of a no-deal Brexit, according to MPs. The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) said government preparations for avoiding disruption around major ports were ""worryingly under-developed"". Committee members also said there was a ""real risk"" the Department for Transport (DfT) would not be ready for a hard Brexit. The DfT said the committee's conclusions were not ""accurate"". In a statement it said it was ""both disappointed and surprised"" that the PAC had ""failed to reflect"" the evidence in the National Audit Office's report ""which found that the department has made a determined effort in its preparations and achieved a great deal"". The UK is set to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. The PAC is responsible for scrutinising the value for money of public spending, and holding the government to account for the delivery of public services. It has published a series of reports looking at different government departments' preparations for Brexit. As with these previous reports, it was ""concerned about how well government is prepared"". Brexit: Exports 'could be stuck at border' Defra 'in dark' over Brexit preparations No urgency in Brexit planning MPs warn Committee chairwoman Meg Hillier said: ""The future of road, rail, maritime and air access to Europe after Brexit remains unclear and the Department for Transport has a critical role in ensuring the UK is prepared. ""With so little time remaining, there is still much to do. The risks associated with no-deal are severe, yet plans for avoiding disruption around major ports in particular are worryingly under-developed."" The DfT intends to introduce ""Project Brock"", to deal with lorry queues on roads to Dover for cross-Channel journeys. The plan involves holding coast-bound lorries on the M20 so traffic not heading for the port can carry on moving. Much of the criticism in this report from MPs is centred on the notion that the Department for Transport (DfT)'s preparations for a ""no deal"" scenario have been too secretive. They argue that it makes it harder for the wider business community to plan. We have known for some time now that the government has been using non-disclosure agreements when it has been discussing no-deal plans with transport companies. Some details have leaked out. For example, I've been told that officials have been asking ferry companies about their capacity to carry vital supplies in the event of EU customs checks causing disruption at the border. The DfT says preparations need to be kept secret to avoid them damaging the commercial interests of the firms involved. And details of Operation Brock, the department's Â£35m plan to keep traffic flowing freely on the M20 near Dover, have been published, as well as other preparatory schemes, like the one to ensure that holiday-makers travelling to the EU can access international driving permits. However, the Public Accounts Committee feels it hasn't been able to properly scrutinise many aspects of the department's no-deal planning and it argues that has contributed to its perception, outlined in this report, that the DfT is being ""complacent"" and that there is a risk that our transport systems and infrastructure won't be sufficiently prepared for ""no deal"" come 29 March. Ms Hillier said the DfT planned to spend Â£30-Â£35m on Project Brock, but had not yet carried out proposed ""desk-based"" testing. Engagement with businesses had been ""poor"", she added. ""The secrecy around the department's preparations and the shortcomings in assurance on its progress are a potentially toxic combination."" The PAC recommended that the DfT should write to it before Christmas ""setting out the results of any testing of Project Brock, and how wider plans to keep ports across the UK open for business have progressed"". The Road Haulage Association's chief executive Richard Burnett said the report had confirmed what many members had told the body. ""Information has been patchy, often unhelpful, confusing and generally too little, too late,"" he said. ""This has left hauliers at the sharp end of a bad Brexit outcome, struggling to keep the supply chain operating and their firms in business."" The PAC said it acknowledged the ""difficult situation"" for the DfT in having to prepared for all Brexit scenarios. However, it felt the department must be ""open about the challenges it faces and work with business and stakeholders to help them get ready for what the future brings"".

"A popular massage-booking app left thousands of customer records exposed, including complaints about those who had asked for sexual favours. Urban, previously known as Urban Massage, left its online database containing 309,000 customer profiles unsecured, a security researcher found. Among the records were allegations of sexual assault, linked to identifiable individuals. Urban said it was investigating the problem and took the database offline. The problem was discovered by researcher Oliver Hough, who shared the discovery withnews site TechCrunch.,external ""This data could literally have led to some serious blackmail,"" he wrote on Twitter. The data included thousands of complaints from therapists, detailing clients who had asked for sexual services or genital massages. Some clients were labelled as ""dangerous"" and some were blocked because of ongoing police investigations. The complaints included each client's name, address and telephone number. TechCrunch informed Urban of the problem and the company took the database offline. Chief executive Jack Tang said he had informed the UK's Information Commissioner of the breach and would also inform its customers. In a statement, the company said: ""We immediately closed the potential vulnerability and have taken all appropriate action, including by notifying users and the ICO.

"This video can not be played People in vehicles were among those caught up in the floods Sydney has been deluged by the heaviest November rain it has experienced in decades, causing flash-flooding, traffic chaos and power cuts. Heavy rain fell throughout Wednesday, the city at one point receiving its average monthly rainfall in two hours. Officials said dozens of vehicles crashed in the stormy conditions, with winds of up to 90km/h (55mph) also recorded. At least two deaths have been blamed on the storm. A 14-year-old boy died in a car accident in Thornleigh, in the north of Sydney on Wednesday morning. A volunteer with the state's emergency service also died while out on duty, and two police officers were injured after being hit by a falling tree while trying to help Sydney motorists, authorities said. Images posted online showed downed trees and flooded roads, houses and train stations. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The weather played havoc with commuters in Australia's biggest city, with many transport services cancelled or delayed - including 130 flights at the international airport. A spokeswoman for Sydney airport said it was forced to operate only one runway after two others were closed due to the storm. Australia's Bureau of Meteorology said it was the region's wettest November day since 1984. ""The intensity of that rainfall was phenomenal - 91mm fell in 90 minutes,"" forecaster Rob Taggart told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Sydney had one month's worth of rain in two hours, meteorologists say Council workers attempt to clear a drain The storm centred on coastal parts of New South Wales (NSW), but was reported to have missed manyinland regions affected by drought. Ausgrid, the country's biggest electricity network, said the storm had cut electricity to more than 8,000 customers around the Sydney area. By Wednesday evening, more than 3,250 homes and businesses were still reported to be without power. What does it take to break a drought? Authorities urged people to try to avoid travelling where possible, as the two main phases of the rain fell around commuting times. ""We cannot stress enough that motorists should never attempt to drive through flood waters or cross flooded causeways,"" assistant commissioner Michael Corboy of NSW Police said on Wednesday. The floods are not the only extreme weather currently being experienced in Australia. In Queensland, further north, thousands have been evacuated as an unprecedented heatwave grips the region,sparking destructive bushfires and dust-storms.

"Actors can find the jobs are few and far between Almost two-thirds of performers (63%) earned less than Â£5,000 from their profession in the last year, a survey suggests. That's an improvement on the 77% figure from a similar 2014 survey of actors, musicians and dancers by entertainment recruitment firm The Mandy Network. But the latest survey found that half of the 3,000 members who responded took on unpaid roles every year. And 60% had to take second jobs outside entertainment to make ends meet. One in five had not had a paid job in the entertainment industry in the past six months, while just 13% took home more than Â£20,000 per year from performing, the survey found. Annameka is determined to keep pursuing her dream Actress Annameka Andrade told the BBC she graduated from the Brit School in south London in 2006 and got a job as a film runner as she thought it might be a ""back door"" into the industry. But she then found she was ""pigeonholed [in production]... so that was a fail"". Annameka then worked in a call centre and later in exhibition sales, which gave her the flexibility to go for auditions. ""I got into this when I was 15, I'm 35 now, and I haven't given up,"" she says. ""I've changed my agent recently. I'm not ashamed because I love what I do but I don't have the things a normal adult would have at 35. The income is more at the level of a student/internship. ""Every so often you get a commercial, which makes up a huge chunk of your income for the year, but it's never consistent."" Annameka has appeared in films including Payback Season (2012) and in TV campaigns for the likes of Hovis, Heinz, Channel 4, EE and Tesco, along with her theatre work. She also says the industry is ""a perfect breeding ground for mental health issues"". The report's findings also indicate that some people working in the industry have mental health problems, with 63% of women and 48% of men surveyed struggling with anxiety. It also found that 59% of women and 61% of men suffer from stress, while 37% of women and 36% of men say they have had depression. Annameka says: ""Your family members and friends try to be supportive but you know they're questioning whether you're doing the right thing, they're doing normal jobs, while you're almost constantly unemployed and you have a passion that isn't fully ignited so you feel unfulfilled."" Annameka founded an actors' society in 2009 and ""invited a lot of casting directors, which was really helpful"". She adds: ""I learned about the industry. The casting directors are the gateway to the jobs. I'm still going!"" Phillip Large, chief executive of The Mandy Network, said the survey showed it's still difficult to break into the industry if you don't have other means of supporting yourself. ""As this industry continues to draw criticism for its lack of diversity, too many of the meaningful job opportunities are still being handed out behind closed doors, while pay levels dictate that only the financially secure or those with other income streams can really afford to remain in the sector in the long term,"" he said. Mandy also surveyed film and TV crew members. While pay among crew is higher than for performers, 54% of crew members still earn less than Â£10,000 per year, 13% take unpaid work every month, and 12% have been unable to find paid work in the past six months. 'Job-shamed' Cosby actor lands TV job Working class actors are rising again How do career dreams really work out? A spokesperson for creative trade union Equity said: ""Access to work in the entertainment and creative industries should be about talent. ""Our industries will only thrive by attracting and retaining professional talent, regardless of background or circumstances. ""An increasingly diverse audience both wants and expects to see and hear itself reflected authentically and its expectations are even higher of publicly-funded theatres and broadcasters."" The report also demonstrated evidence of a gender imbalance within both pay and opportunities. Eighty-two per cent of women earn less than Â£10,000 per year, compared with 69% of men, while 63% of women have a second job outside entertainment to help support themselves, compared with 57% of men. The Mandy Network carried out the online survey of 3,067 of its members between 12 and 30 October 2018.

"118 118 is the most popular directory inquiry service The price of a call to directory inquiries will be capped at Â£3.65 for 90 seconds. Phone industry regulator Ofcom said it is responding to a ""steep"" rise in prices. The most popular service, 118 118, charges Â£11.23 for a 90 second call,the regulator said,external. The number of calls being made to 118 services has been falling by 40% a year, but more than a million people a year still use the service. Many of those using 118 services are elderly, Ofcom said. People aged over 65 are four times more likely to call 118 numbers than those aged between 16 and 34. They are also ""significantly"" less likely to have internet access, meaning they cannot search for a number online. ""Directory inquiry prices have risen in recent years, and callers are paying much more than they expect. Our evidence shows this is hurting people, with some struggling to pay their bills,"" said Jane Rumble, Ofcom's director of consumer policy. The regulator found that some providers are charging almost Â£20 for a 90-second call. Although there are cheaper services, customers tend to call the numbers they can most easily remember, Ofcom's study found. Ofcom based the cap on its own research into what customers expected to pay. It also used prices in 2012 as a reference. That was the year of its previous review, which found ""little evidence"" of people paying more than expected. 118 004 Telecom2        Â£19.98 118 118 TNUK              Â£11.23 118212  Maureen         Â£11.23 118247  Yell                  Â£6.88 118 500 BT                    Â£3.10 118 402 O2                   Â£1.13 118 855  Post Office      Â£1.00 Source: Ofcom The 118 numbers were introduced in 2003 when the directory inquiry market was opened up by the regulator. In recent years there has been a dramatic decrease in the number of people using the services. Ofcom said that in the third quarter of 2014, about 7.1 million people called 118 numbers, but by the second quarter of 2017 that figure had fallen to 1.95 million. Almost two thirds of those calling a 118 service had no idea of its cost and about a quarter of them had no internet connection, Ofcom found. Responding the price cap, Digital Minister Margot James said: ""It's about time that this horrendous ripping off of customers was brought to an end.

"Theresa May went head-to-head with Jeremy Corbyn in the House of Commons. Here's what happened. Will the UK be worse off under the prime minister's Brexit plans or not? That was the question Jeremy Corbyn wanted answering at this session, after the Treasury published an analysis suggesting the UK would be less well off under all Brexit options when compared with staying in the EU. Brexit will make UK worse off, government warns Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt had said Mrs May's deal would mitigate ""most"" of the negative impacts of Brexit, said the Labour leader. Which of the negative impacts would not be mitigated? Mrs May said her deal was the best available to protect the economy and ""honour"" the EU referendum result. The ""biggest risk"" to the economy was a Labour government, she added. ""It is not hard to be the best deal if it is the only deal,"" observed the Labour leader, ""by definition it is also the worst"". In fact, he went on, there was no deal ""just a 26-page wish list"".

Referring to Philip Hammond saying the UK would be ""slightly worse off"" under the prime minister's deal, Mr Corbyn noted the chancellor's absence from the front bench and asked if Mrs May agreed with his remarks. Mrs May said: ""The analysis shows the deal we have negotiated is the best deal for the economy and delivers on the results of the referendum. ""He calls the political declaration a wish list, but this is an ambitious, broad and flexible partnership,"" she added. ""The Labour Party has six bullet points to offer. My weekend shopping list is longer than that."" The Labour leader quoted a damning UN report, which had said it was ""clear"" the impact of Brexit on people in poverty was an ""after-thought"". If the PM's deal was so great, he asked, why were MPs ""not queuing up"" to back it? Farmers in Wales, fishermen in Scotland and employers in Northern Ireland were backing it, claimed the prime minister. She defended the government's economic record, saying figures today showed the number of children living in workless households was ""at a record low"". Mr Corbyn quoted the UN report again, which said there were 14 million people living in poverty in the UK. He then quoted business leaders, who had said her Brexit deal was the ""worst of all worlds"". She had gone from ""guaranteeing frictionless trade, to offering friction and less trade"", said the Labour leader, and the country had ""no faith"" in the next stage of talks being completed within two years. Did the PM prefer ""extending the transition with further vast payments to the European Union or falling into the backstop with no exit"", asked Mr Corbyn. There is an exit ""from the backstop"", said Mrs May, and it was ""perfectly possible"" to turn the 26-page political declaration into legal text within two years. Then it was on to the attorney general's legal advice on the withdrawal agreement, which Labour wants published in full. Mrs May had petitioned Tony Blair for the full legal advice on the Iraq war to be published, said Mr Corbyn, what has changed? Mrs May cited client confidentiality and said MPs would get to see a ""full reasoned position statement"" and Attorney General Geoffrey Cox would make a statement and answer MPs questions. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn asks the PM why she does not practise what she preached Mr Corbyn said the government was the most shambolic ""in living memory"" and 20 of her own ministers had resigned. It was ""clear that Parliament will not back this plan"", he told the PM and it was time for her to ""accept that reality, make way for an alternative plan that can work for the whole country"". Mrs May said she ""will take no lectures"" from someone who has had more than ""100 resignations"" from his frontbench. She said ""what really lies behind Labour's approach"" was a desire to ""cause chaos, frustrate Brexit and overturn the will of the British people... that would be a betrayal of the many by the few"". This video can not be played Theresa May says Labour wants to ""cause chaos, frustrate Brexit and overturn the will of the British people"" The SNP's leader at Westminster Ian Blackford also made hay with Philip Hammond's comments on the economic impact of Theresa May's Brexit plans.

This video can not be played SNP MP Douglas Chapman on lessons from Brexit negotiations that will help Scotland dissolve the Act of Union. Here is BBC Parliamentary Correspondent Mark D'Arcy's take on the session: After the PM endured another 45 minutes at the dispatch box, dodging the Brexit crossfire from the opposition and her own party's various factions, what have we learned? Theresa May stuck by her line that the government would not release the full text of its legal advice on the Brexit deal - no surprise, really, and it would have been a bit of a surrender and a dangerous precedent, had she agreed. Instead she said the government's top lawyer, the Attorney General, Geoffrey Cox, could make a statement to MPs, and answer questions. Did the answer to Labour's Dame Louise Ellman signal some subtle softening on the issue of a second referendum? The PM has rebuffed endless requests for a so-called ""People's Vote"" over the last few weeks, usually observing that there has already been a referendum, and often adding that the main parties at the last election promised to respect the result. This time the prime minister did say that it was important to deliver on the decision of the people, but also added that there would not be time to hold a further referendum before Brexit Day - 29 March - as the Article 50 period (the period before the UK left, having given notice of intent to withdraw) would have to be extended. Random variation of phrase, or a soft signal of some kind? Hmmm. Jeremy Corbyn enjoyed himself in a target-rich environment, noting that Theresa May once demanded that Tony Blair published his advice on the legality of the Iraq War, and highlighting the opposition to her Brexit deal among her own MPs. But the real threat to the PM was behind her, on the Conservative benches. Brexiteers Anne Marie Trevelyan, Peter Bone and David Amess all attacked aspects of the deal, and received polite rebuffs. And the Scottish Conservative Douglas Ross raised the dangers of a fisheries deal which did not meet promises to the fishing industry. The PM sailed through it allâ¦ this was much of a muchness with the questioning in the series of Brexit statements over the last fortnight. And perhaps the sense of dÃ©jÃ  vu drained some of the hostility from this latest repeat performance. Hard Brexiteers to the right of her, Remainers to the left, Labour with its cannons trained on her, and leadership rivals lurking under camouflage, the PM seems to be heading for certain defeat in the Meaningful Vote in a fortnight. Yet on she goes. Westminster is, frankly, a bit baffled. Does she have some masterstroke to deploy? Has she banked the prospect of defeat and based her strategy on a second vote to get through a slightly tweaked deal - with modest concessions from Brussels already prepared and waiting? Or is she simply hoping against hope that her opponents, internal or external, will somehow retreat at the last moment. Is it magnificent? Is it politics? We'll know in a fortnight. Remember, Theresa May will be at the dispatch box for PMQs the day after the Meaningful Vote. Maybe all will be revealed two weeks today.

"It feels like Westminster is tumbling towards a political crisis without modern precedent. On Tuesday 11 December, the House of Commons will conclude five days of debate with a vote on a government motion to approve the EU withdrawal agreement and accompanying political declaration. The terms of the UK's departure from the EU. But at the moment, it looks as if Theresa May faces an incredibly hard job getting it passed. She leads a government with a working majority of just 13. Only seven Tory rebels are needed to defeat it. EU won't offer 'better deal' on Brexit - May DUP may revisit Tory deal says Foster Brexit vote will be honoured, says Abbott But according to the latest number-crunching by BBC researchers, 81 Tory MPs have said they object to the deal Mrs May hopes to sign off with EU leaders on Sunday. With Labour, the Liberal Democrats, the SNP and even perhaps the DUP set to vote against the motion too, the withdrawal agreement looks set to be torpedoed in the Commons. Between now and then Theresa May will exhaustively insist the deal is in the national interest and the only way of ensuring Brexit happens. But if the withdrawal agreement is defeated, what happens then? The default position in that scenario would be for the UK to leave without a deal. Under both EU law and the UK's Withdrawal Act, Brexit day is chiselled into the diary for 11pm on 29 March, 2019. That's when the EU Treaties will stop applying to the UK. If Parliament rejects the deal, the same Withdrawal Act sets out what the government must do next. Ministers would have up to 21 days to make a statement to the Commons on ""how it proposes to proceed"". The government would then have a further seven days to move a motion in the Commons, allowing MPs to express their view on the government's course of action. This video can not be played Radio 4 The World at One asks: What will happen if Parliament rejects the Brexit plan? Crucially though, this would not be opportunity for MPs to throw a road-block in the way of a no-deal Brexit if that's what the government wanted to happen. Whatever motion the government brings back to Parliament will now have to be amendable, after MPs backed a change to it tabled by Conservative MP Dominic Grieve. MPs are hoping this will allow them to vote to rule-out a no-deal Brexit. The government would find it hard to ignore such a vote - but it would not carry the legal force to stop the UK leaving without a deal next March. Instead, the government would have to put new legislation before Parliament and secure the approval of MPs if it did not want the UK to leave without a deal. As the clerk of the House of Commons, Sir David Natzler, told a committee of MPs last month, ""there is no House procedure that can overcome statute. Statute is overturned by statute."" Can May get Brexit deal through Commons? Sir David Natzler (seated, front left) says MPs could vote again But in addition to the rigid legal position there would be the frenzied political reality. The maximum three-week window between the government's deal being defeated and the requirement on ministers to propose a way forward would see several alternative scenarios come into play. The prime minister could make a second attempt at getting the withdrawal deal through the Commons. Sir David Natzler said, in procedural terms, that would be possible. ""The words might be the same but the underlying reality would be self-evidently be different"", Sir David said. Brussels might be persuaded to tweak the political declaration on the future relationship to meet the concerns of MPs. Theresa May could try to return to Brussels to renegotiate the Northern Irish ""backstop"" - the main sticking point for many MPs. The government has long insisted this is not an option, because the EU has said the existing deal is final and there is no alternative. Might Brussels give Mrs May some leeway if she loses the vote by a narrowish margin? Some MPs hope she could get behind another version of Brexit at this point. There is support on the Tory benches for a membership of the European Free Trade Area, which would see the UK staying closely linked to the EU, like Norway. This would not be a straightforward move - and would require extensive renegotiation, even if the EU was prepared to contemplate it, and the extension of Article 50, delaying Brexit day. Then there is Labour's proposal for a permanent customs union - Mrs May has always ruled that out, but if enough MPs get behind it, it might be an option, although, again, it would need Article 50 to be extended to allow for more talks. Unlikely, given her track record of doggedly ploughing on against the odds - but if she is defeated by a heavy margin on 11 December she may feel she has no other option. There would then be a Tory leadership contest, which would turn into a fight to the death between the Leave and Remain wings of the party, with profound effects on the future of Brexit and, indeed, the country. Jacob Rees-Mogg's band of Brexiteers famously failed to reach the magic 48 letters of no confidence in the PM to trigger a leadership contest last month. But if she tries to cling on after a significant defeat on 11 December, more MPs could add their names to the list, forcing a no-confidence vote that she might struggle to win. MPs might suddenly shift in large numbers towards the idea of another referendum to break the Parliamentary impasse and open the possibility of stopping Brexit. At the moment, about eight Tory and 44 Labour MPs have publicly committed to another referendum. Theresa May is dead set against another referendum and it's hard to see an alternative Tory leader picking up that baton. But the Labour leadership has said all options should remain on the table (including another referendum) and the SNP and Lib Dems say there should be one too. However, a second referendum can only happen if the government brings forward legislation to hold one and a majority in the Commons supports it. There would have to be legislation. The rules for referendums are set out by thePolitical Parties, Elections & Referendums Act 2000,external. TheElectoral Commission's,externalrecommendation is that there should be six months between the legislation being passed and referendum day. This could be shortened but, realistically, not by all that much. The UCL Constitution Unit, a research centre on constitutional change, suggests that could be 22 weeks. So for the referendum to happen there would have to be a delay to Brexit - and that would require all 27 EU member states and the UK to agree. This is Labour's preferred outcome to the deal being rejected. But as Dr Jack Simson Caird from the Bingham Centre for the Rule of Law says, ""with the ticking clock of Article 50 it's very difficult to see that this represents a solution to the problem"" of a deadlocked parliament. That will be the other critical factor at play. Unless the government asks for an extension to the negotiating period - ie Brexit being delayed - the time for parliament and the government to agree a way forward is incredibly tight.  The clock won't wait. There are two routes to a general election through the Fixed Term Parliament Act. Two-thirds of MPs could vote for one. This is the quickest route - a poll could be held as soon as 25 working days later. Alternatively MPs could go for a no confidence motion in the government - Labour has said they will table such a motion if Mrs May loses on 11 December. This is a straight majority rather than requiring two thirds of MPs to vote for it. This gives two weeks for someone to demonstrate they can command a majority in the Commons. If that does not happen, the 25 working days countdown to a general election kicks in. Any election now would be on the existing constituency boundaries. The new ones have to be approved by the Commons and the Lords. And that has been put on hold until after Brexit. Another idea that has been floated is a ""negotiated no deal"" in the which the UK would ask the EU for a (paid) one year extension of membership before leaving on World Trade Organisation terms. Some Brexiteers might like the idea but it's hard to see Parliament supporting such a move - with or without an explicit vote. Because Parliament will have to come to a view. As Maddy Thimont Jack, from the Institute for Government think tank says: ""We do have Parliamentary sovereignty and there are clear ways for Parliament to express a very strong political view. ""I cannot see how a government can get through a legislative programme, for no deal, for example, if you don't have the support of Parliament."" Theresa May might have neutralised the chance of defeat in the Commons if she had found a Parliamentary consensus for the Brexit she planned to negotiate right at the start of the process. Instead, she faces a fraught few days and a vote that will define the country's future for many years. Right now, it looks like the government's deal cannot get through the Commons.

"In her victory speech, Cindy Hyde-Smith promised to represent all Mississippians Republican Cindy Hyde-Smith has won Mississippi's racially charged Senate election, beating a challenge from the black Democrat, Mike Espy. It extends the Senate majority of President Donald Trump's party 53 for Republicans and 47 for Democrats. The race narrowed after Ms Hyde-Smith, who is white, was recorded saying she would happily attend a public hanging. The comments evoked the lynching of African-Americans in a state scarred by a history of racial violence. With nearly all votes counted, Ms Hyde-Smith had taken 53.9% of the vote in the staunchly Republican state compared to 46.1% for Mr Espy. President Trump tweeted his congratulations.

In a statement, Ms Hyde-Smith said: ""I want everybody to know, no matter who you voted for today, I am going to represent every Mississippian."" Conceding to his opponent, Mr Espy tweeted that he was ""proud of the historic campaign we ran and grateful for the support"". Senator's 'public hanging' joke criticised An unflinching look at Mississippi's darkest moments Are people being barred from voting in US? With her victory, Ms Hyde-Smith became the first ever US congresswoman to be elected from Mississippi. Now, only the northern, more liberal, state of Vermont has never elected a woman to congress. The seat will be up for re-election again in 2020, with a full six-year-term at stake. The run-off election campaign had dredged up aspects of the Deep South state's ugly past. On Monday, several nooses were found at the Mississippi capitol in Jackson in an apparent protest against the tenor of the campaign. Signs alongside the ropes urged voters to elect ""someone who respects the lives of lynch victims"" and ""remind people that times haven't changed"", according to local media. This election became more competitive after a video emerged earlier this month of Ms Hyde-Smith - who is the incumbent senator - saying she would be ""on the front row"" if one of her supporters ""invited me to a public hanging"". For many, the comment evoked past lynchings of African-Americans. Analysis by Chris Buckler, BBC News, Mississippi Many said this was Cindy Hyde-Smyth's election to lose - and some will argue she seemed to try pretty hard. Joking about a public hanging in a state with a history of racially-motivated lynchings wasn't just insensitive - it was a rallying call for opponents. A number of businesses even asked her for their donations to be returned. Eventually there was an apology but by then the comments had come to overshadow Senator Hyde-Smith's campaign and everywhere she faced questions about racial division rather than the election race. Despite everything she can console herself in the knowledge that this was a decisive win. President Trump, who congratulated her on the result, will also be patting himself on the back. He undoubtedly helped to motivate his supporters with appearances in Mississippi at eve-of-election rallies. Yet Democrats and their candidate Mike Espy may well claim some sort of moral victory. In a state widely regarded as a Republican stronghold they made this run-off election a genuine battle. In his statement admitting defeat, Mr Espy pointedly wrote that Mississippi's future would be brighter than its past. According to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), Mississippi had the highest number of lynchings in the nation from 1882 to 1968. Mr Espy condemned his rival's comment as ""reprehensible""; Ms Hyde-Smith maintained there was no ""negative connotation"". The Democrat has himself come under scrutiny for his 2011 lobbying work in the Ivory Coast, whose former leader Laurent Gbagbo is on trial at the International Criminal Court. Mr Espy was agriculture secretary under President Bill Clinton, but resigned under a cloud of corruption allegations, on which he was later acquitted. Democratic challenger Mike Espy criticised incumbent Republican Cindy Hyde-Smith over recent racially charged comments Ms Hyde-Smith, meanwhile, was further criticised when photos surfaced of her posing at the home of Confederate President Jefferson Davis, with the caption: ""Mississippi history at its best."" A video of Ms Hyde-Smith apparently encouraging voter suppression also emerged on Twitter. That recording showed the senator saying there were some liberals ""who maybe we don't want to vote - maybe we want to make it just a little more difficult [to vote]"". Her campaign later said the comment was a joke and the video had been ""selectively altered"",the Washington Post reported,external. At a recent debate, Ms Hyde-Smith gave a qualified apology to anyone she had offended, while adding that opponents had ""twisted"" her words ""as a political weapon"". ""It came out of your mouth,"" Mr Espy had replied. ""I don't know what's in your heart, but we all know what came out of your mouth."" President Donald Trump travelled to Mississippi on the eve of the vote to campaign for Ms Hyde-Smith. ""I know her, and I know she apologised, and she misspoke,"" the Republican president told reporters on his way to the state. He painted Mr Espy as a far-left ideologue who would ""rather protect illegal aliens than people who live in Mississippi"", and questioned how he ""fit in with Mississippi"". President Donald Trump journeyed to Mississippi to campaign for Ms Hyde-Smith Had he won, Mr Espy would have become the first black senator for Mississippi since the Reconstruction era following the US Civil War. Mr Espy's campaign had pushed the idea that electing Ms Hyde-Smith would stoke a lingering view of Mississippi as a racist southern state. ""We can't afford a senator who embarrasses us and reinforces the stereotypes we've worked so hard to overcome,"" one ad for the Democrat said. Mr Espy needed to overwhelmingly win the black vote and a substantial number of white voters to unseat his Republican opponent.

After Republican Senator Thad Cochran resigned in April, a special election for Mississippi's US Senate seat was arranged. Under the state's law, if no candidate wins over 50% of the votes, a runoff election must take place. On 6 November during the mid-term elections, both Ms Hyde-Smith and Mr Espy received about 41% of the vote.

"Actors can find the jobs are few and far between Almost two-thirds of performers (63%) earned less than Â£5,000 from their profession in the last year, a survey suggests. That's an improvement on the 77% figure from a similar 2014 survey of actors, musicians and dancers by entertainment recruitment firm The Mandy Network. But the latest survey found that half of the 3,000 members who responded took on unpaid roles every year. And 60% had to take second jobs outside entertainment to make ends meet. One in five had not had a paid job in the entertainment industry in the past six months, while just 13% took home more than Â£20,000 per year from performing, the survey found. Annameka is determined to keep pursuing her dream Actress Annameka Andrade told the BBC she graduated from the Brit School in south London in 2006 and got a job as a film runner as she thought it might be a ""back door"" into the industry. But she then found she was ""pigeonholed [in production]... so that was a fail"". Annameka then worked in a call centre and later in exhibition sales, which gave her the flexibility to go for auditions. ""I got into this when I was 15, I'm 35 now, and I haven't given up,"" she says. ""I've changed my agent recently. I'm not ashamed because I love what I do but I don't have the things a normal adult would have at 35. The income is more at the level of a student/internship. ""Every so often you get a commercial, which makes up a huge chunk of your income for the year, but it's never consistent."" Annameka has appeared in films including Payback Season (2012) and in TV campaigns for the likes of Hovis, Heinz, Channel 4, EE and Tesco, along with her theatre work. She also says the industry is ""a perfect breeding ground for mental health issues"". The report's findings also indicate that some people working in the industry have mental health problems, with 63% of women and 48% of men surveyed struggling with anxiety. It also found that 59% of women and 61% of men suffer from stress, while 37% of women and 36% of men say they have had depression. Annameka says: ""Your family members and friends try to be supportive but you know they're questioning whether you're doing the right thing, they're doing normal jobs, while you're almost constantly unemployed and you have a passion that isn't fully ignited so you feel unfulfilled."" Annameka founded an actors' society in 2009 and ""invited a lot of casting directors, which was really helpful"". She adds: ""I learned about the industry. The casting directors are the gateway to the jobs. I'm still going!"" Phillip Large, chief executive of The Mandy Network, said the survey showed it's still difficult to break into the industry if you don't have other means of supporting yourself. ""As this industry continues to draw criticism for its lack of diversity, too many of the meaningful job opportunities are still being handed out behind closed doors, while pay levels dictate that only the financially secure or those with other income streams can really afford to remain in the sector in the long term,"" he said. Mandy also surveyed film and TV crew members. While pay among crew is higher than for performers, 54% of crew members still earn less than Â£10,000 per year, 13% take unpaid work every month, and 12% have been unable to find paid work in the past six months. 'Job-shamed' Cosby actor lands TV job Working class actors are rising again How do career dreams really work out? A spokesperson for creative trade union Equity said: ""Access to work in the entertainment and creative industries should be about talent. ""Our industries will only thrive by attracting and retaining professional talent, regardless of background or circumstances. ""An increasingly diverse audience both wants and expects to see and hear itself reflected authentically and its expectations are even higher of publicly-funded theatres and broadcasters."" The report also demonstrated evidence of a gender imbalance within both pay and opportunities. Eighty-two per cent of women earn less than Â£10,000 per year, compared with 69% of men, while 63% of women have a second job outside entertainment to help support themselves, compared with 57% of men.

""I got into this when I was 15, I'm 35 now, and I haven't given up,"" she says. ""I've changed my agent recently. I'm not ashamed because I love what I do but I don't have the things a normal adult would have at 35. The income is more at the level of a student/internship. ""Every so often you get a commercial, which makes up a huge chunk of your income for the year, but it's never consistent."" Annameka has appeared in films including Payback Season (2012) and in TV campaigns for the likes of Hovis, Heinz, Channel 4, EE and Tesco, along with her theatre work. She also says the industry is ""a perfect breeding ground for mental health issues"". The report's findings also indicate that some people working in the industry have mental health problems, with 63% of women and 48% of men surveyed struggling with anxiety. It also found that 59% of women and 61% of men suffer from stress, while 37% of women and 36% of men say they have had depression. Annameka says: ""Your family members and friends try to be supportive but you know they're questioning whether you're doing the right thing, they're doing normal jobs, while you're almost constantly unemployed and you have a passion that isn't fully ignited so you feel unfulfilled."" Annameka founded an actors' society in 2009 and ""invited a lot of casting directors, which was really helpful"". She adds: ""I learned about the industry. The casting directors are the gateway to the jobs. I'm still going!"" Phillip Large, chief executive of The Mandy Network, said the survey showed it's still difficult to break into the industry if you don't have other means of supporting yourself. ""As this industry continues to draw criticism for its lack of diversity, too many of the meaningful job opportunities are still being handed out behind closed doors, while pay levels dictate that only the financially secure or those with other income streams can really afford to remain in the sector in the long term,"" he said. Mandy also surveyed film and TV crew members. While pay among crew is higher than for performers, 54% of crew members still earn less than Â£10,000 per year, 13% take unpaid work every month, and 12% have been unable to find paid work in the past six months. 'Job-shamed' Cosby actor lands TV job Working class actors are rising again How do career dreams really work out? A spokesperson for creative trade union Equity said: ""Access to work in the entertainment and creative industries should be about talent. ""Our industries will only thrive by attracting and retaining professional talent, regardless of background or circumstances. ""An increasingly diverse audience both wants and expects to see and hear itself reflected authentically and its expectations are even higher of publicly-funded theatres and broadcasters."" The report also demonstrated evidence of a gender imbalance within both pay and opportunities. Eighty-two per cent of women earn less than Â£10,000 per year, compared with 69% of men, while 63% of women have a second job outside entertainment to help support themselves, compared with 57% of men.

"Silk garment prescriptions for people with eczema and dermatitis cost the health service in England more than Â£1.2m a year NHS England has announced plans to curb the prescription of ""low-priority"" items like silk garments. There is limited evidence the clothing helps people with eczema and dermatitis enough to justify prescribing it, aconsultation document,externalsays. Officials are proposing ending the routine prescription of eight items under plans aimed at saving Â£68m a year. Others include an acne medication and diabetes products. The items, which are deemed to be of relatively low clinical effectiveness or to have cheaper options available for funding, are: Silk garments - for eczema and dermatitis (low clinical effectiveness) Aliskiren - used to treat blood pressure (cheaper options available) Amiodarone - to treat abnormal heart rhythms (low clinical effectiveness) Bath and shower emollient preparations - to treat eczema and dermatitis (low clinical effectiveness) Dronedarone - to treat the heart condition atrial fibrillation (low clinical effectiveness) Minocycline - to treat acne (low clinical effectiveness) Blood glucose testing strips - for type-2 diabetes (cheaper options available) Needles for pre-filled and reusable insulin pens - for type-1 and type-2 diabetes (cheaper options available) Many prescribers will not be surprised by the recommendations and have already started phasing out some of the items. The health service in England spends more than Â£1.2m a year on prescriptions for silk garments, examples of which include silk baby bodysuits, infant leggings, children's pyjamas, gloves or tubular sleeves. In the case of the testing strips and needles, officials are proposing that GPs prescribe the cheaper versions of these products. It said there was a big variation in price, with strips ranging from Â£5 to Â£16 and needles costing between Â£4 and Â£30. NHS England has already ordered an end to the routine prescribing of 18 low-value items, including homeopathy treatments and over-the-counter products such as paracetamol and cough medicines. NHS no to dandruff and diarrhoea treatment NHS targets suncream prescriptions for cuts NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens said: ""The NHS is one of the most efficient health services in the world but, as part of the long-term plan for the NHS, we're determined to make taxpayers' money go further and drive savings back into front-line care. ""It is essential the NHS should not be paying for anything which has been proven to be ineffective or where there are safer or cheaper alternatives."" The consultation comes ahead of GPs being issued with new guidance next week on gluten-free prescriptions. While patients can still receive bread and gluten-free baking mixes under NHS prescriptions, they are no longer eligible for other foodstuffs such as pizzas, cakes and biscuits, NHS England said. Officials added that the NHS began funding gluten-free food products in the late 1960s, when availability was limited, but now a wide variety of foods is available in supermarkets. The consultation will run for three months from 28 November 2018 until 28 February 2019, after which joint commissioning guidance is expected to be published by NHS England and NHS Clinical Commissioners. The National Eczema Society said it was ""vital for people with eczema to have access to the right emollient products on prescription"".

"The European Union says it is aiming to become the first major economy to go ""climate neutral"" by 2050. Under the plan, emissions of greenhouse gases after that date would have to be offset by planting trees or by burying the gases underground. Scientists say that net-zero emissions by 2050 are needed to have a fighting chance of keeping global temperatures under 1.5C this century. The EU says the move will also cut premature air pollution deaths by 40%. CO2 rises for the first time in four years Trump dismisses US climate change report Climate neutrality means your emissions are balanced by methods of removing warming gases from the atmosphere. So the warming emissions that are created by cars and power plants should be counteracted by the greenhouse gases removed from the air by the planting of new forests or through carbon capture technologies which would see the CO2 buried underground. Getting to this point would require large cuts in emissions from the current position. Since 1990 the EU has cut its emissions by over 20% while the economies of member states have continued to grow. They have set themselves much harder targets for 2030 of cutting emissions by 40% - The EU says it will achieve this target but now plans to go much further again by becoming climate neutral by 2050. The EU have set out  eight scenarios for member states to cut warming gases  - two of these strategies would see Europe become climate neutral. The EU says that this can be done with existing technologies such as solar and wind energy which would have to be ramped up to provide 80% of electricity. Energy efficiency measures such as home insulation would also need to be boosted to reduce energy consumption by half by the middle of the century. ""With this plan, Europe will be the world's first major economy to go for net-zero emissions by 2050,"" said EU climate commissioner Miguel Arias CaÃ±ete. ""We have all the tools to be ambitious."" The EU believes that the measures will help achieve the goals of the Paris agreement will be expensive but will boost economies by 2% of GDP by 2050 and reduce energy imports by over 70%, saving up to three trillion euros a year. The IPCC report on keeping temperatures below 1.5C was a ""wake-up call"" said Mr CaÃ±ete. Reports in recent days have also underlined just how far the gap has grown between what countries promised to do under the Paris agreement, and how far they've gotten with those endeavours. The UN emissions gap study also showed that the majority of rich countries are not on track to meet their carbon cutting commitments by 2030. With global climate talks due to start in a few days in Poland the EU's move, although still a strategy and not a firm commitment, will be welcome news. ""If we do not lead, no one else will,"" said Mr CaÃ±ete. Not quite. Some countries such as Germany are struggling with their current commitments and are worried that further cuts would threaten their industries. Others such as Poland are still reliant on coal and would object to even more stringent restrictions on the use of fossil fuels. Some countries though are keen to press ahead - a group of ten, including Denmark, Sweden and Spainhave written a letter to the EU,externalasking for a ""clear direction"" towards net-zero emissions. Climate campaigners say the step, though welcome, doesn't go far enough fast enough. They are worried that there is no plan to increase the intermediate targets for 2030, which many scientists say is crucial. They also want the net-zero date brought forward. EU climate commissioner Miguel Arias CaÃ±ete ""We are calling for 2040 as the time that would be most in line with safer scenarios to keep temperatures under 1.5C,"" said Wendel Trio from Climate Action Network Europe. ""Going to net-zero by 2050 as the Commission proposes might need a lot of reliance on carbon removal techniques, there are lots of proposals but it is not clear that it can actually happen."" Sweden has legislated to achieve net zero emissions by 2045. Other countries are looking at it, including the UKwhich has asked the Committee on Climate Changeto report on the idea. The EU says there needs to be a debate among member states about how to achieve this long term goal. The plan is to adopt and submit the ambitious strategy to the UN by early 2020. However any further development could be held up by the fact that a new EU commission will be selected next year.

"This video can not be played Theresa May insisted her deal would protect jobs and provide new opportunities for exporters The prime minister has insisted her Brexit agreement is a ""good deal for Scotland"" that will protect jobs and provide new opportunities for business. Theresa May was speaking as she met factory workers in Renfrewshire as she seeks to build support for the plan. Her proposals have faced strong criticism from opposition parties - as well as from many of her own MPs. But she says the country is facing a straight choice between her deal, or leaving the EU without any deal. Ahead of Mrs May's visit to Scotland, the UK government published analysis which suggested the country's economy could be up to 3.9% smaller after 15 years under her Brexit plan, compared with staying in the EU - but that a no-deal Brexit could deliver a 9.3% hit. The Bank of England subsequently warned that a no-deal Brexit would send the pound plunging and trigger a worse recession than the financial crisis. Brexit will make UK worse off, government warns No-deal Brexit could sink UK into recession A guide to where we are with Brexit Mrs May's proposals are opposed by Labour, the SNP, Liberal Democrats, the Democratic Unionists and many Conservative MPs on both sides of the Brexit debate - meaning she currently looks unlikely to get parliamentary approval for her deal. On Tuesday, First Minister Nicola Sturgeonunveiled a Scottish government analysis paperwhich claimed the Brexit deal could cost Scotland Â£9bn a year by 2030, compared to if it had remained in the EU. Ms Sturgeon, who wants the UK to remain permanently in the single market and customs union and has backed calls for another referendum on the Brexit terms, has said the SNP's 35 MPs at Westminster will vote against the deal on 11 December. Nicola Sturgeon unveiled Scottish government analysis of the deal at her Bute House residence on Tuesday But the prime minister said the deal she had negotiated for the UK would be a ""good deal for Scotland"" as it would provide a ""free trade area with no tariffs, no fees"". She added: ""That will mean a opportunity to carry on their trade. but also gives us the opportunity to negotiate trade deals around the world that will be good for great Scottish exports like Scotch Whisky, Scottish salmon and smoked salmon. ""So this is a deal that is right for Scotland and right for Scottish fishermen, because we'll take back control of our waters and ensure they have a bright future for Scottish fishing."" Why is everyone talking about fishing? What happens if MPs reject Brexit deal? Why the Irish border is a big deal in Scotland Labour's shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has suggested it is ""inevitable"" another EU referendum will be called if Labour are not able to force a general election. But Mrs May said his comments were proof that Labour ""want to go against and overturn the vote of the British people"". The UK government has highlighted the support the deal has received in recent days from Diageo, National Farming Union Scotland, the Scotch Whisky Association and BAE Systems, who have also warned about the consequences of ""no deal"" for Scotland. Jim Ratcliffe - the owner of chemicals giant Ineos, which operates the Grangemouth facility - has also said Mrs May's deal had his ""full support"", describing it as a ""pragmatic and sensible arrangement"". The company said its analysis showed a no-deal Brexit would carry ""significant risk"" for its business, and urged MPs to ""put the good of the country ahead of political considerations and ensure a safe passage for the deal through Parliament."" This video can not be played SNP MP Douglas Chapman asks Mrs May about lessons from the Brexit negotiations that will help Scotland dissolve the Act of Union The trip to Scotland was the latest stop in a two-week tour by Mrs May as she tries to promote and sell her deal to the public and business. On Tuesday, the prime minister made similar visits to Wales and Northern Ireland - where she faced criticism from Democratic Unionist leader Arlene Foster, whose party has a parliamentary pact to support the Conservative government in key votes. And speaking as she unveiled the Scottish government's latest Brexit analysis paper, Ms Sturgeon said the deal was ""unacceptable to the Scottish government and damaging to the people of Scotland"". The document included analysis - first published in January - claiming that a new free trade agreement could leave Scots Â£1,600 worse off per year by 2030, compared to a scenario where the UK remains in the EU. It also warned the ""backstop"" being put in place to prevent the return to a hard border in Ireland could leave Scotland at a ""serious competitive disadvantage"" to Northern Ireland. Ms Sturgeon said: ""It will not end uncertainty. It will extend it. We are being asked to accept a blindfold Brexit with all the difficult decisions kicked down the road.""

"The UK will be poorer economically under any form of Brexit, compared with staying in the EU, new government analysis suggests. Official figures say the UK economy could be up to 3.9% smaller after 15 years under Theresa May's Brexit plan, compared with staying in the EU. But a no-deal Brexit could deliver a 9.3% hit, the new estimates say. The prime minister said her deal was the best one available for jobs and the economy. ""Our deal is the best deal available for jobs and our economy, that allows us to honour the referendum and realise the opportunities of Brexit,"" Mrs May said at Prime Minister's Questions. The government's Brexit deal faces a potentially difficult vote in the House of Commons on 11 December. Before that Mrs May is touring the country to promote the deal and was due to be in Scotland on Wednesday afternoon. Reality Check: Can forecasts get it wrong? May defends Brexit deal Davis attacks 'flawed' Brexit forecasts A guide to where we are with Brexit Reality Check: Is Trump right about the Brexit deal? Confusinglythe 83-page document does not,externalforecast the impact of the prime minister's current deal. Instead it looks at the potential impact of the proposals agreed by the Cabinet at Chequers in July, which is the basis of the current proposal. Under those circumstances the economy would be 3.9% smaller than if the UK had remained part of the European Union. The estimates do not put a cash figure on the potential impact on the economy, but independent experts have said that 3.9% of GDP would equate to about Â£100bn a year by the 2030s. The government report also examines three other possible scenarios including a no-deal Brexit, which would be the most damaging. The economy will continue to grow under all the scenarios, but there is a wide variation in how much. Former Brexit Secretary David Davis questioned the research, saying previous Treasury forecasts had been proved wrong and were based on ""flawed assumptions"". Chancellor Philip Hammond said the planned Brexit deal combined most of the economic benefits of remaining in the EU with the political benefits of leaving the EU. Asked if the UK would be poorer under Mrs May's deal, he said: ""The economy will be slightly smaller in the prime minister's preferred version of the future partnership."" But Mr Hammond argued that staying in the EU was not politically ""viable"". Veteran Conservative Eurosceptic Sir Bill Cash said Mr Hammond was effectively arguing for the UK to stay in the European Union in his ""extraordinary"" statement. He said the chancellor had ignored potential economic benefits of leaving the EU, asking: ""What about the trade deals which could give us the most enormous opportunities throughout the world, if we are able to strike them?"" Under Mrs May's deal, the UK would be able to negotiate trade deals during the transition period after 29 March's Brexit day, but would not be able to implement them until the end of the planned 21-month transition period, which could itself be extended. By Andrew Walker, BBC economics correspondent This exercise doesn't predict how much the economy will grow over the 15-year period, but rather the impact of specific changes in Britain's trade relationships, other things being equal. That is after all the question we want answered. One problem is that it will be harder to judge when we look back whether the figures were right, because we would be comparing what actually happened with a hypothetical alternative that didn't. The same applies to the impact on the government's finances. That said, all the scenarios in the analysis show an adverse effect; the saving on contributions to the EU is more than offset by the lower tax revenues that would result from the weaker economic growth. There are also some striking differences in regional economic impacts. In the no-deal situation the biggest effects are in North East England and the West Midlands. London gets away with least damage in that situation, but the capital is worst hit in the government's preferred option. That is because London specialises in services that would gain less, compared to no deal, than manufacturing from the relationship the government is seeking to negotiate.

"This video can not be played Rape victim Sammy Woodhouse says she is ""constantly being re-victimised"" A victim of child sexual exploitation has called for a change in the law amid claims a man who raped her was offered a role in her son's life. It is understood Arshid Hussain, who was jailed for 35 years in 2016, was contacted by Rotherham Council about care proceedings heard last year. His victim Sammy Woodhouse told the BBC she was ""shocked"" when she was informed of the council's approach. The authority said it had ""no intention"" of putting a child at risk. Urgent efforts would be taken to ""address the failings in this case"", The MoJ said. Latest news from across Yorkshire Ms Woodhouse described Hussain as ""a danger to myself and to other children"". In a video posted on Twitter she urged the government ""to change the law to ensure rapists can't gain access to children conceived through rape"". 'What about my rights?' Hussain, known around Rotherham as Mad Ash, was one of three brothers behind the grooming and sexual abuse of more than 50 girls, including Ms Woodhouse. She was just 14 when she met him. Arshid Hussain was convicted of grooming and sexually abusing young girls in Rotherham Ms Woodhouse, who waived her anonymity in an effort to help other victims, said she thought when Hussain was jailed she could then get on with her life and would never hear from him again. Speaking on the Victoria Derbyshire programme, Ms Woodhouse said: ""We're constantly being re-victimised and as a rape victim I'm constantly told 'well actually, he's got his human rights'. ""What about my human rights?  What about other people's human rights and our children and our right to constantly have to keep our children safe?"" Ms Woodhouse, who now speaks about child sexual exploitation and her experiences, is calling for changes to the 1989 Children Act, alongside Sheffield Heeley MP Louise Haigh. Although Hussain has not made any application, Ms Woodhouse said it was important to get the law changed to protect others. ""This is happening all over the country, and it needs to stop,"" she added. Ms Woodhouse said her son was supporting her and had given his permission for her to speak out. According to The Times, the council had contacted Hussain and promised to keep him informed about future proceedings, after he was listed as a ""respondent"" in a Family Court case involving the boy. Solicitor Denise Lester, former chair of the Law Society's children law sub-committee, described it as ""a very, very difficult case"". ""The issue here is the law as it stands allows rapists and other abusers to participate in care and other public law proceedings She added: ""But, within that there are obviously procedures and decisions that would be made on a case by case basis by social workers to exclude a father or not"".

This means that by default, a convicted rapist does have the right to be notified of care proceedings involving his child. If they are married to their victim, men convicted of rape have parental responsibility and will automatically be a party in any court proceedings in which they will have their interests considered. That's the legal status that gives parents right to be given information about and be involved in important decisions affecting their child's upbringing. This doesn't mean they have any automatic rights to contact with their children however. Any application for access will assess the risk to a child and their welfare before allowing contact. Councils can apply to the court to make an exceptional order in order to avoid notifying a parent of care proceedings - although it's not guaranteed this application will be successful. These are usually only granted in cases where the child has no relationship with the father - such as in cases of stranger rape - or where there is a risk to the child, for example in cases of extreme domestic violence. In a statement, the authority said: ""We must be clear that at no stage has it been the intention of the council to put any child at risk, or to allow any convicted child sexual exploitation offender to have care of any child."" It was seeking clarification from the Ministry of Justice as to how legal directions relating to Family Court proceedings should be applied, it said.

"Mark Luckie left Facebook in early November, disappointed at how he felt black people were treated When it rains, it pours - and Facebookâs utterly sodden year continues to be flooded by accusations of bad governance. Mark Luckie, a black, former Facebook employee whose job it was to handle the firmâs relationship with âinfluencersâ, put it quite plainly: âFacebook has a black people problem.â His 2,500-word note, posted on Tuesday, outlines what he sees as a culture that talks about inclusion, but does not practise it. In some buildings at the company, Mr Luckie said, there were âmore âBlack Lives Matterâ posters than there are actual black peopleâ. He goes on to outline how he, and other black employees, often felt uncomfortable at work. âBlack staffers at Facebook know that by raising our voices we risk jeopardizing our professional relationships and our career advancement,â he wrote. Beyond those who work for Mark Zuckerberg, Mr Luckie said he felt Facebookâsblack users are also being unfairly treated,external. âBlack people are finding that their attempts to create âsafe spacesâ on Facebook for conversation among themselves are being derailed by the platform itself. âNon-black people are reporting what are meant to be positive efforts as hate speech, despite them often not violating Facebookâs terms of service.â Mr Luckieâs comments rippled around social media. And what followed next fell into line with whatâs now a familiar pattern: Facebook puts out a conciliatory statement, only to have it later undermined by leaks of internal discussions that seem to show a different picture. 'Self-serving' First came the public statement, from Facebook spokesman Anthony Harrison. âThe growth in representation of people from more diverse groups, working in many different functions across the company, is a key driver of our ability to succeed. âWe want to fully support all employees when there are issues reported and when there may be micro-behaviours that add up. We are going to keep doing all we can to be a truly inclusive company.â But then, the internal leak. While Mr Luckieâs post was made public on Tuesday, it had been circulated at Facebook on 8 November. At that time it received a response from Ime Archibong, Facebookâs director of product partnerships. On Tuesday, Mr Luckie, posted that response on Twitter suggesting Facebookâs tone publicly did not necessarily match what was said to him internally. Mr Luckie seemed to attempt to protect Mr Archibongâs identity by blurring his name and picture, but missed one mention of âImeâ elsewhere on the screen, revealing the source. Mr Archibong - who is also black - hasconfirmed he wrote the comments,external. He described Mr Luckieâs note as âpretty self-serving and disingenuousâ and accused him of having a âselfish agenda and not one that has the best intentions of the community and people you likely consider friends at heartâ. Everyone is, naturally, entitled to their opinion. And Mr Archibong was speaking for himself, not the company. And, as is always the case in a huge company, everyoneâs experience could be different, and the examples given anecdotal. But this whole furore again reignites the perception that Facebook is more preoccupied with notlookingbad, rather than assessing if it isdoingbad. Containment over contrition. The bottom line is that the statistics tell enough of a story: Facebookâs community of 2.7bn users is run by a workforce where black people make up just 4% - or 1% if youâre looking specifically at developer roles. Thereâs nothing anecdotal about that. ________ Follow Dave Leeon Twitter @DaveLeeBBC,external Do you have more information about this or any other technology story?

"Mike Tinmouth says the fraudsters were convincing A bank customer was tricked into transferring money by fraudsters who pretended to be responding to his angry Twitter post about poor service. Writer Mike Tinmouth was furious with the process and time taken to open a business account with Barclays. He expressed his frustration in a public tweet - which was seized on by fraudsters who posed as the bank in an attempt to trick him out of Â£8,000. Fraud experts say con-artists are becoming skilled at impersonation. Mr Tinmouth wanted to open a business account to deal with the income and expenditure of some properties that he was letting to tenants. He applied to Barclays, but the process dragged on and eventually he made a complaint on Twitter. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

He even posted an email that he received from the bank which he felt was unprofessional and had to confirm was genuine. The bank urged him to delete this public post. All this information, together with some personal details that were already available about him online, was enough for fraudsters to mimic the bank and appear to know details of the case. ""They targeted me because they are monitoring the big banks' customer support Twitter channels where they can get enough information on name, location, and photo to then be able to track down further information,"" he said. Soon after the Twitter exchange, he received another email apologising for the poor service and offering to deal with his case. This time the message was from a fraudster posing as his bank. After various exchanges, he was provided with details of his ""new"" account, and he started to transfer money from his personal current account with a different bank. The transfer was blocked, saving Mr Tinmouth from losing the Â£8,000 he intended to move between the two accounts. Barclays said that customers should always be careful about posting details in public, and that it had a system of ensuring customers dealt with the bank's social media teams on private channels. No-one should transfer money to a new account without having all the relevant paperwork and full control of the account, a spokesman added. ""In this case, we advised Mr Tinmouth on the process he should follow to speak to us about his query. However while we were in contact, he engaged with an unverified email address and provided personal information to scammers, which led to him being targeted,"" a spokesman said. Katy Worobec, managing director of economic crime at UK Finance, which represents the major banks, said that criminals would try to impersonate legitimate organisations, such as banks, police, utility companies or retailers. They would contact potential victims through social media applications in an attempt to trick them into giving away their details. ""Always question any phone calls, texts, tweets or emails out of the blue asking for your personal information in case it is a scam, and never automatically click on any links,"" she said. ""Instead contact the company directly on a known phone number or email, such as the one on their official website. If you think your personal or financial information may have been stolen, contact your bank straight away and also report it to Action Fraud."" The attempt to trick Mr Tinmouth happened in the same week that plans were confirmed for anew systemaimed at reducing fraud. The Payment Systems Regulator has now opened consultation into the proposal to ensure than a recipient's name is checked, along with their account number and sort code when transferring money. When setting up a new payment, or amending an existing one, banks will be able to check the name on the account of the person or organisation you are paying. If you use the correct account name, you will receive confirmation that the details match, and can proceed with the payment If you use a similar name to the account holder, you will be provided with the actual name of the account holder to check. You can update the details and try again, or contact the intended recipient to check the details If you enter the wrong name for the account holder you will be told the details do not match and advised to contact the person or organisation you are trying to pay This process would have stopped Mr Tinmouth earlier in the process, as he would have realised that the destination account was not his own, but in the name of somebody else entirely. Other victims of fraud may also have been stopped from transferring money had they realised the account holder they were paying was wrong. Gareth Shaw, from consumer group Which?, said the change - which would take effect ""early"" in 2019 - was long overdue. ""Customers will question why it's taken their bank so long to implement a system that could have prevented devastating financial losses years ago,"" he said. ""To halt the alarming rise in bank transfer scams we must now see swift implementation of this much-needed measure across the board.""

"The European Union says it is aiming to become the first major economy to go ""climate neutral"" by 2050. Under the plan, emissions of greenhouse gases after that date would have to be offset by planting trees or by burying the gases underground. Scientists say that net-zero emissions by 2050 are needed to have a fighting chance of keeping global temperatures under 1.5C this century. The EU says the move will also cut premature air pollution deaths by 40%. CO2 rises for the first time in four years Trump dismisses US climate change report Climate neutrality means your emissions are balanced by methods of removing warming gases from the atmosphere. So the warming emissions that are created by cars and power plants should be counteracted by the greenhouse gases removed from the air by the planting of new forests or through carbon capture technologies which would see the CO2 buried underground. Getting to this point would require large cuts in emissions from the current position. Since 1990 the EU has cut its emissions by over 20% while the economies of member states have continued to grow. They have set themselves much harder targets for 2030 of cutting emissions by 40% - The EU says it will achieve this target but now plans to go much further again by becoming climate neutral by 2050. The EU have set out  eight scenarios for member states to cut warming gases  - two of these strategies would see Europe become climate neutral. The EU says that this can be done with existing technologies such as solar and wind energy which would have to be ramped up to provide 80% of electricity. Energy efficiency measures such as home insulation would also need to be boosted to reduce energy consumption by half by the middle of the century. ""With this plan, Europe will be the world's first major economy to go for net-zero emissions by 2050,"" said EU climate commissioner Miguel Arias CaÃ±ete. ""We have all the tools to be ambitious."" The EU believes that the measures will help achieve the goals of the Paris agreement will be expensive but will boost economies by 2% of GDP by 2050 and reduce energy imports by over 70%, saving up to three trillion euros a year. The IPCC report on keeping temperatures below 1.5C was a ""wake-up call"" said Mr CaÃ±ete. Reports in recent days have also underlined just how far the gap has grown between what countries promised to do under the Paris agreement, and how far they've gotten with those endeavours. The UN emissions gap study also showed that the majority of rich countries are not on track to meet their carbon cutting commitments by 2030. With global climate talks due to start in a few days in Poland the EU's move, although still a strategy and not a firm commitment, will be welcome news. ""If we do not lead, no one else will,"" said Mr CaÃ±ete. Not quite. Some countries such as Germany are struggling with their current commitments and are worried that further cuts would threaten their industries. Others such as Poland are still reliant on coal and would object to even more stringent restrictions on the use of fossil fuels. Some countries though are keen to press ahead - a group of ten, including Denmark, Sweden and Spainhave written a letter to the EU,externalasking for a ""clear direction"" towards net-zero emissions. Climate campaigners say the step, though welcome, doesn't go far enough fast enough. They are worried that there is no plan to increase the intermediate targets for 2030, which many scientists say is crucial. They also want the net-zero date brought forward. EU climate commissioner Miguel Arias CaÃ±ete ""We are calling for 2040 as the time that would be most in line with safer scenarios to keep temperatures under 1.5C,"" said Wendel Trio from Climate Action Network Europe. ""Going to net-zero by 2050 as the Commission proposes might need a lot of reliance on carbon removal techniques, there are lots of proposals but it is not clear that it can actually happen."" Sweden has legislated to achieve net zero emissions by 2045. Other countries are looking at it, including the UKwhich has asked the Committee on Climate Changeto report on the idea. The EU says there needs to be a debate among member states about how to achieve this long term goal. The plan is to adopt and submit the ambitious strategy to the UN by early 2020. However any further development could be held up by the fact that a new EU commission will be selected next year.

"Police said the video was filmed at Almondbury Community School A 16-year-old boy is to be charged with assault after a video showing a 15-year-old Syrian refugee being attacked was shared on social media. The boy is shown being dragged to the ground at a school in Huddersfield before water is poured into his face. The video was filmed in a lunch break at Almondbury Community School on 25 October, West Yorkshire Police said. The force said the older boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, will appear at Youth Court ""in due course"".

"118 118 is the most popular directory inquiry service The price of a call to directory inquiries will be capped at Â£3.65 for 90 seconds. Phone industry regulator Ofcom said it is responding to a ""steep"" rise in prices. The most popular service, 118 118, charges Â£11.23 for a 90 second call,the regulator said,external. The number of calls being made to 118 services has been falling by 40% a year, but more than a million people a year still use the service. Many of those using 118 services are elderly, Ofcom said. People aged over 65 are four times more likely to call 118 numbers than those aged between 16 and 34. They are also ""significantly"" less likely to have internet access, meaning they cannot search for a number online. ""Directory inquiry prices have risen in recent years, and callers are paying much more than they expect. Our evidence shows this is hurting people, with some struggling to pay their bills,"" said Jane Rumble, Ofcom's director of consumer policy. The regulator found that some providers are charging almost Â£20 for a 90-second call. Although there are cheaper services, customers tend to call the numbers they can most easily remember, Ofcom's study found. Ofcom based the cap on its own research into what customers expected to pay. It also used prices in 2012 as a reference. That was the year of its previous review, which found ""little evidence"" of people paying more than expected. 118 004 Telecom2        Â£19.98 118 118 TNUK              Â£11.23 118212  Maureen         Â£11.23 118247  Yell                  Â£6.88 118 500 BT                    Â£3.10 118 402 O2                   Â£1.13 118 855  Post Office      Â£1.00 Source: Ofcom The 118 numbers were introduced in 2003 when the directory inquiry market was opened up by the regulator. In recent years there has been a dramatic decrease in the number of people using the services. Ofcom said that in the third quarter of 2014, about 7.1 million people called 118 numbers, but by the second quarter of 2017 that figure had fallen to 1.95 million. Almost two thirds of those calling a 118 service had no idea of its cost and about a quarter of them had no internet connection, Ofcom found. Responding the price cap, Digital Minister Margot James said: ""It's about time that this horrendous ripping off of customers was brought to an end. The new price cap will go a long way in protecting consumers from astronomical fees.""

"Mark Luckie left Facebook in early November, disappointed at how he felt black people were treated When it rains, it pours - and Facebookâs utterly sodden year continues to be flooded by accusations of bad governance. Mark Luckie, a black, former Facebook employee whose job it was to handle the firmâs relationship with âinfluencersâ, put it quite plainly: âFacebook has a black people problem.â His 2,500-word note, posted on Tuesday, outlines what he sees as a culture that talks about inclusion, but does not practise it. In some buildings at the company, Mr Luckie said, there were âmore âBlack Lives Matterâ posters than there are actual black peopleâ. He goes on to outline how he, and other black employees, often felt uncomfortable at work. âBlack staffers at Facebook know that by raising our voices we risk jeopardizing our professional relationships and our career advancement,â he wrote. Beyond those who work for Mark Zuckerberg, Mr Luckie said he felt Facebookâsblack users are also being unfairly treated,external. âBlack people are finding that their attempts to create âsafe spacesâ on Facebook for conversation among themselves are being derailed by the platform itself. âNon-black people are reporting what are meant to be positive efforts as hate speech, despite them often not violating Facebookâs terms of service.â Mr Luckieâs comments rippled around social media. And what followed next fell into line with whatâs now a familiar pattern: Facebook puts out a conciliatory statement, only to have it later undermined by leaks of internal discussions that seem to show a different picture. 'Self-serving' First came the public statement, from Facebook spokesman Anthony Harrison. âThe growth in representation of people from more diverse groups, working in many different functions across the company, is a key driver of our ability to succeed. âWe want to fully support all employees when there are issues reported and when there may be micro-behaviours that add up. We are going to keep doing all we can to be a truly inclusive company.â But then, the internal leak. While Mr Luckieâs post was made public on Tuesday, it had been circulated at Facebook on 8 November. At that time it received a response from Ime Archibong, Facebookâs director of product partnerships. On Tuesday, Mr Luckie, posted that response on Twitter suggesting Facebookâs tone publicly did not necessarily match what was said to him internally. Mr Luckie seemed to attempt to protect Mr Archibongâs identity by blurring his name and picture, but missed one mention of âImeâ elsewhere on the screen, revealing the source. Mr Archibong - who is also black - hasconfirmed he wrote the comments,external. He described Mr Luckieâs note as âpretty self-serving and disingenuousâ and accused him of having a âselfish agenda and not one that has the best intentions of the community and people you likely consider friends at heartâ. Everyone is, naturally, entitled to their opinion. And Mr Archibong was speaking for himself, not the company. And, as is always the case in a huge company, everyoneâs experience could be different, and the examples given anecdotal. But this whole furore again reignites the perception that Facebook is more preoccupied with notlookingbad, rather than assessing if it isdoingbad. Containment over contrition. The bottom line is that the statistics tell enough of a story: Facebookâs community of 2.7bn users is run by a workforce where black people make up just 4% - or 1% if youâre looking specifically at developer roles.

"This video can not be played Anna Simpson said she had hoped for a calm birth but the experience was ""not what I imagined it to be"" A woman left with PTSD after the birth of her daughter says she relived the trauma ""over and over again"" as she cared for her newborn. Anna Simpson described the emergency C-section as the most frightening experience of her life. A study has suggested up to 28,000 women a year in the UK could be affected by maternal post-traumatic stress disorder. NHS England said it was ""improving mental health support for new mums"". Ms Simpson, 34, from Wakefield in West Yorkshire, was rushed to an operating theatre with her unborn daughter Macie in the breech position, after two unsuccessful attempts to move the baby in the womb. ""There were a lot of people around me,"" she said. ""There was an anaesthetist trying to put a cannula in my hand so I felt like it was being attacked, it felt very frightening, I was very scared."" Experts warn that PTSD - commonly associated with soldiers returning from war - is harder to treat the longer it goes undiagnosed. Anna Simpson says the therapy she went through has helped her recover A traumatic birth can involve unexpected events including the baby's heart rate dropping significantly, an emergency caesarean section and the mother losing several pints of blood after haemorrhaging. Mothers have a post-natal appointment about six weeks after the baby's birth to assess recovery and check for post-natal depression, but PTSD is not routinely looked for. More news and stories from Yorkshire Ms Simpson, whose daughter is now 16 months old, said: ""I was going through the birth over and over again, it was exhausting and really painful. ""It was physically draining, all that on top of having to look after a new baby was really difficult."" Months after the birth, she noticed her emotions were not fading so tried cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) followed by a successful programme of eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR). EMDR works on the theory that traumatic memories have not been properly processed by the brain, but can be reprocessed correctly via therapy involving eye movement, aural and physical prompts. Vivid flashbacks Intrusive thoughts and images Nightmares Intense distress and real or symbolic reminders of the trauma Physical sensations such as pain, sweating, nausea or trembling Source: Mind Research from academics at City, University of London, published in theJournal of Affective Disorders,external, suggested 3-4% of women report PTSD in pregnancy and after birth. Using this percentage, they calculated 28,000 women could be affected in the UK each year. Son's birth drove me to a breakdown Extra leave for premature babies' parents Rise in women having induced labours Prof Susan Ayers, who co-authored the study, said: ""We need to raise awareness of birth trauma and PTSD both in the general public but also in professionals that come in contact with women. ""We need to train healthcare professional in terms of identifying [affected] women and we also need to have clear, effective evidence-based treatments."" Ms Simpson was rushed to an operating theatre with her unborn daughter Macie in the breech position Dr Rebecca Moore, from the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said many women who experienced PTSD were being ""failed by the current provision"". ""Many women who have had a traumatic birth in the UK are not diagnosed, misdiagnosed or cannot access rapid, specialist, trauma-specific treatment,"" she added. Kim Thomas, from the Birth Trauma Association, said: ""We have had women come to us who have had their traumatic birth experience 20 or 30 years ago and they are still experiencing the symptoms. ""If you don't get treatment then your symptoms can go on for years and years."" Sources of support for PTSD and birth trauma include: Birth Trauma Association,external Pandas Foundation,external Mind - PTSD and birth trauma,external Ms Simpson suggested the therapy she went through had helped her recover. ""I just don't feel fragile anymore, the emotion that was bubbling under the surface all the time has gone and I can talk about it,"" she said. ""It's so nice for me because really it was a lovely thing for me to have a baby, it is so nice to be able to talk about it now."" In a statement, NHS England said: ""Any form of mental ill-health during pregnancy, labour or early parenthood is of real concern, but great strides have been made in improving mental health support for new mums with 7,000 more women receiving treatment last year. ""In addition, specialist mental health services will be available in every single part of England by April next year and the long-term plan for the NHS will set out further improvements in care.""

"This video can not be played The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge visited the scene of the crash The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge paid tribute to the victims of the helicopter crash outside Leicester City's stadium on a visit to the city. Club chairman Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha and four others died when the aircraft came down on 27 October. The couple visited the crash site to meet players and hear about charities Mr Vichai supported, before going to the University of Leicester. Prince William has said he was lucky to have known Mr Vichai for several years. The former air ambulance helicopter pilot revealed during his visit he had flown with pilot Eric Swaffer, who died in the crash, only a few months before describing the experience as a ""privilege"". The Duchess of Cambridge laid flowers at the scene of the fatal helicopter crash Prince William personally knew Mr Vichai and described him as a man ""dedicated to his family"" On arriving at the King Power stadium, Prince William clasped the hand of club vice-chairman and Mr Vichai's son Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha with both of his and spoke intently to him, before introducing Catherine. Live: Royals visit helicopter crash site The Duchess left a bouquet of flowers at the crash site and a condolence card, signed by the couple, which read: ""To Vichai and all those who died in this terrible tragedy, you will be dearly missed. Our sincere condolences to the city of Leicester.""

He said: ""It's nice of him [The Duke of Cambridge] to pay his respects. He's found time to come and share the grief of the whole club."" By David Pittam, BBC News, outside the King Power Stadium This was a visit for the royal couple to pay their respects Barriers were in place for a crowd of hundreds but in the end it was only a few dozen who braved the rain for this royal visit. And among those who did show up, the mood was a little subdued. There was the excitement of spotting the Prince and Duchess and there was a fair bit of flag waving as they drove by. But this was a visit for the royal couple to pay their respects and the crowd understood that. It's hard to forget that the helicopter crash was so near - and many people were just happy to see such high profile recognition of the tragedy. As one dad-of-four put it, they're ""sharing in our grief"". Inside the stadium there was a special message above the pitch to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. Prince William and Catherine also met members of the club's staff and volunteers who helped relocate the thousands of tributes left outside the King Power Stadium. A sign inside the stadium welcomed the royal couple Prince William, a keen football fan, and Catherine were given a tour of the stadium from Mr Vichai's son At the club, the Duke gave a speech where he said the club did ""something that should have been impossible"" by winning the Premier League in 2016. He said: ""Against odds that are now the stuff of legend, you took on the Goliaths and superstars of the world's most famous football league. ""In powering past them all to win the title, you wrote the best underdog story in the history of modern sport. ""And when the man that led this club to victory died so tragically, the people of this city revealed with their outpouring of admiration, that they too shared much of the character that was so central to who Vichai was. ""In a time when our football clubs have become huge global enterprises, you came out to thank Vichai for making the fans the true owners of this club."" Vice-chairman and Mr Vichai's son, Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha, and Mr Vichai's widow Aimon were at the crash site before the royal couple arrived Crowds cheered as Leicester City striker Jamie Vardy arrived During their visit to the university the Duke and Duchess heard of some of the educational programmes the club had helped to support. This included a Â£1m donation by Mr Vichai in May to treat and research life-threatening illnesses, a resuscitation programme and a programme which helped children learn and develop life skills. One of the children who has received help through a community project Mr Vichai supported, Sai Gokani, presented the Duchess with flowers and gave her a kiss before she left. He originally went in for a handshake, prompting laughter from those watching. Sai Gokani presented the Duchess with flowers and gave her a kiss Hundreds of people waited in the rain outside the University of Leicester for the royal couple Hundreds of students, staff and fans of the royals lined Centenary Square at the university to see the couple as they left. Braving the ran and cold, their spirits were not dampened by the time the couple emerged from the university library and they walked out to a chorus of cheers from the crowds, said BBC reporter Nick Smith. The couple smiled and waved to the cheering crowd at the University of Leicester Prince William, pictured with Mr Vichai, previously paid tribute to the late chairman after the crash Prince William, who is president of the Football Association, personally knew Mr Vichai and previously described him as a man ""dedicated to his family"". Mr Aiyawatt said it was an ""honour"" to welcome the royal couple to the King Power Stadium. He added: ""For their Royal Highnesses to visit the city to pay their respects personally is a remarkable gesture of compassion to the families of those who lost their lives, to the staff and players of the club and to the people of the city whose lives were touched by my father.""

"The UK will be poorer economically under any form of Brexit, compared with staying in the EU, new government analysis suggests. Official figures say the UK economy could be up to 3.9% smaller after 15 years under Theresa May's Brexit plan, compared with staying in the EU. But a no-deal Brexit could deliver a 9.3% hit, the new estimates say. The prime minister said her deal was the best one available for jobs and the economy. ""Our deal is the best deal available for jobs and our economy, that allows us to honour the referendum and realise the opportunities of Brexit,"" Mrs May said at Prime Minister's Questions. The government's Brexit deal faces a potentially difficult vote in the House of Commons on 11 December. Before that Mrs May is touring the country to promote the deal and was due to be in Scotland on Wednesday afternoon. Reality Check: Can forecasts get it wrong? May defends Brexit deal Davis attacks 'flawed' Brexit forecasts A guide to where we are with Brexit Reality Check: Is Trump right about the Brexit deal? Confusinglythe 83-page document does not,externalforecast the impact of the prime minister's current deal. Instead it looks at the potential impact of the proposals agreed by the Cabinet at Chequers in July, which is the basis of the current proposal. Under those circumstances the economy would be 3.9% smaller than if the UK had remained part of the European Union. The estimates do not put a cash figure on the potential impact on the economy, but independent experts have said that 3.9% of GDP would equate to about Â£100bn a year by the 2030s. The government report also examines three other possible scenarios including a no-deal Brexit, which would be the most damaging. The economy will continue to grow under all the scenarios, but there is a wide variation in how much. Former Brexit Secretary David Davis questioned the research, saying previous Treasury forecasts had been proved wrong and were based on ""flawed assumptions"". Chancellor Philip Hammond said the planned Brexit deal combined most of the economic benefits of remaining in the EU with the political benefits of leaving the EU. Asked if the UK would be poorer under Mrs May's deal, he said: ""The economy will be slightly smaller in the prime minister's preferred version of the future partnership."" But Mr Hammond argued that staying in the EU was not politically ""viable"". Veteran Conservative Eurosceptic Sir Bill Cash said Mr Hammond was effectively arguing for the UK to stay in the European Union in his ""extraordinary"" statement. He said the chancellor had ignored potential economic benefits of leaving the EU, asking: ""What about the trade deals which could give us the most enormous opportunities throughout the world, if we are able to strike them?"" Under Mrs May's deal, the UK would be able to negotiate trade deals during the transition period after 29 March's Brexit day, but would not be able to implement them until the end of the planned 21-month transition period, which could itself be extended. By Andrew Walker, BBC economics correspondent This exercise doesn't predict how much the economy will grow over the 15-year period, but rather the impact of specific changes in Britain's trade relationships, other things being equal. That is after all the question we want answered. One problem is that it will be harder to judge when we look back whether the figures were right, because we would be comparing what actually happened with a hypothetical alternative that didn't. The same applies to the impact on the government's finances. That said, all the scenarios in the analysis show an adverse effect; the saving on contributions to the EU is more than offset by the lower tax revenues that would result from the weaker economic growth. There are also some striking differences in regional economic impacts. In the no-deal situation the biggest effects are in North East England and the West Midlands. London gets away with least damage in that situation, but the capital is worst hit in the government's preferred option. That is because London specialises in services that would gain less, compared to no deal, than manufacturing from the relationship the government is seeking to negotiate.

"This video can not be played Rape victim Sammy Woodhouse says she is ""constantly being re-victimised"" A victim of child sexual exploitation has called for a change in the law amid claims a man who raped her was offered a role in her son's life. It is understood Arshid Hussain, who was jailed for 35 years in 2016, was contacted by Rotherham Council about care proceedings heard last year. His victim Sammy Woodhouse told the BBC she was ""shocked"" when she was informed of the council's approach. The authority said it had ""no intention"" of putting a child at risk. Urgent efforts would be taken to ""address the failings in this case"", The MoJ said. Latest news from across Yorkshire Ms Woodhouse described Hussain as ""a danger to myself and to other children"". In a video posted on Twitter she urged the government ""to change the law to ensure rapists can't gain access to children conceived through rape"". 'What about my rights?' Hussain, known around Rotherham as Mad Ash, was one of three brothers behind the grooming and sexual abuse of more than 50 girls, including Ms Woodhouse. She was just 14 when she met him. Arshid Hussain was convicted of grooming and sexually abusing young girls in Rotherham Ms Woodhouse, who waived her anonymity in an effort to help other victims, said she thought when Hussain was jailed she could then get on with her life and would never hear from him again. Speaking on the Victoria Derbyshire programme, Ms Woodhouse said: ""We're constantly being re-victimised and as a rape victim I'm constantly told 'well actually, he's got his human rights'. ""What about my human rights?  What about other people's human rights and our children and our right to constantly have to keep our children safe?"" Ms Woodhouse, who now speaks about child sexual exploitation and her experiences, is calling for changes to the 1989 Children Act, alongside Sheffield Heeley MP Louise Haigh. Although Hussain has not made any application, Ms Woodhouse said it was important to get the law changed to protect others. ""This is happening all over the country, and it needs to stop,"" she added. Ms Woodhouse said her son was supporting her and had given his permission for her to speak out. According to The Times, the council had contacted Hussain and promised to keep him informed about future proceedings, after he was listed as a ""respondent"" in a Family Court case involving the boy. Solicitor Denise Lester, former chair of the Law Society's children law sub-committee, described it as ""a very, very difficult case"". ""The issue here is the law as it stands allows rapists and other abusers to participate in care and other public law proceedings She added: ""But, within that there are obviously procedures and decisions that would be made on a case by case basis by social workers to exclude a father or not"". By BBC Reality Check Legal guidelines in England and Wales state that all parents, regardless of parental responsibility, should be given notice of care proceedings. This means that by default, a convicted rapist does have the right to be notified of care proceedings involving his child. If they are married to their victim, men convicted of rape have parental responsibility and will automatically be a party in any court proceedings in which they will have their interests considered. That's the legal status that gives parents right to be given information about and be involved in important decisions affecting their child's upbringing. This doesn't mean they have any automatic rights to contact with their children however. Any application for access will assess the risk to a child and their welfare before allowing contact. Councils can apply to the court to make an exceptional order in order to avoid notifying a parent of care proceedings - although it's not guaranteed this application will be successful. These are usually only granted in cases where the child has no relationship with the father - such as in cases of stranger rape - or where there is a risk to the child, for example in cases of extreme domestic violence. In a statement, the authority said: ""We must be clear that at no stage has it been the intention of the council to put any child at risk, or to allow any convicted child sexual exploitation offender to have care of any child."" It was seeking clarification from the Ministry of Justice as to how legal directions relating to Family Court proceedings should be applied, it said. This was ""not just for Rotherham,"" it added, ""but to ensure that other councils across the country who may face similar issues are able to act with certainty and no more survivors of abuse have to experience further trauma"". A Ministry of Justice statement said: ""Local authorities can apply to courts to request permission not to notify parents without parental responsibility about care proceedings, and courts should consider the potential harm to the child and mother when making this decision."" It added: ""This is obviously a very distressing incident and the relevant departments and local authority will work urgently to understand and address the failings in this case.""

"Some of the detained Ukrainians have appeared in court in Crimea US President Donald Trump says he may cancel a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin following a maritime clash between Russia and Ukraine. Mr Trump told the Washington Post he was waiting for a ""full report"" after Russian ships fired on and seized three Ukrainian boats on Sunday. Ukraine described it as an ""act of aggression"" but Russia said the ships had illegally entered its waters. Martial law has been imposed in parts of Ukraine, in an unprecedented move. Meanwhile, the US has urged European states to do more to support Ukraine. State department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said Washington wanted to see tougher enforcement of sanctions against Russia. Mr Trump and Mr Putin are due to meet on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Buenos Aires later this week. However, Mr Trump told the Washington Post that the report coming from his national security team would be ""very determinative"". ""Maybe I won't have the meeting [with Mr Putin].,externalMaybe I won't even have the meeting. I don't like that aggression. I don't want that aggression at all,"" he said. The two men are scheduled to discuss security, arms control, and issues in Ukraine and the Middle East when the summit convenes on Friday and Saturday, national security adviser John Bolton told reporters. This video can not be played Why tensions between Russia and Ukraine are so high Stakes are high in Ukraine-Russia sea clash Crimea: Who controls its territorial waters? Russian coastguard ships opened fire on Sunday as the two Ukrainian gunboats and a tug sailed through the Kerch Strait off the coast of Crimea, which was annexed by Russia in 2014. Twenty-four Ukrainians were detained and at least three were wounded in the incident. A Crimean court later ordered that 12 of the Ukrainians be detained for 60 days. The court is expected to issue rulings for the remaining servicemen on Wednesday. The FSB security service has since released videos of some of the men making statements. One of them, Volodymyr Lisovyi, said he was aware of the ""provocative nature"" of the Ukrainian action. Volodymyr Lisovyi was one of three men who gave statements described as ""under duress"" by the head of Ukraine's navy Another, Andriy Drach, said he had been on a gunboat with an order to sail from Odessa to Mariupol. ""We were warned by the border service of the Russian Federation that we were violating Russian law. They had repeatedly asked us to leave the territorial waters of the Russian Federation,"" he said. Ukraine's navy commander, Ihor Voronchenko, told Ukrainian TV that the men had given false statements under duress. Russia-Ukraine sea clash in 300 words Russia 'bigger threat than IS' - Army chief Eastern Ukraine: A new, bloody chapter ""I know those sailors from Nikopol. They have always been honest professionals in their jobs, and what they say now is not true,"" he said. The head of Ukraine's SBU security service, Vasyl Hrytsak, confirmed Russian reports that members of the service were on board the boats, but added that it was a ""routine counter-intelligence mission"" of a type that the Russian navy carried out regularly. On Tuesday, President Petro Poroshenko said there was a threat of ""full-scale war"" with Russia. ""The number of [Russian] tanks at bases located along our border has grown three times,"" he said. On Monday night, Ukraine's parliament backed President Poroshenko's decision to impose martial law for a 30-day period from 28 November in 10 border regions. Five of the 10 regions border Russia while two are adjacent to Moldova's breakaway Trans-Dniester region, where Russian troops are stationed. The other three regions border the Black Sea or Sea of Azov close to Crimea. The move to martial law is unprecedented in Ukraine, and gives military authorities the right to ban protests and strikes. The flare-up is the first outright clash between Ukraine and Russian forces for years, although since 2014 pro-Russian separatists and Russian military ""volunteers"" have been fighting Ukraine's army in two eastern regions - Luhansk and Donetsk. Tensions escalated when Russia opened a bridge this year between Russia and Crimea over the Kerch Strait, which leads into the Sea of Azov. Ukraine has two big ports on the northern shore of the Azov sea, and a 2003 treaty allows both countries free access to its waters. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said the seizure of Ukrainian ships is a ""dangerous escalation and a violation of international law"". The UK condemned Russia's ""destabilising behaviour in the region and its ongoing violation of Ukrainian territorial sovereignty"". Taking a call from German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Vladimir Putin argued that the Ukrainians had ""deliberately ignored the rules of peaceful passage in the territorial sea of the Russian Federation"", the Kremlin said. Mrs Merkel had ""stressed the need for de-escalation and dialogue,"" her spokesman said. Crimea: Who controls its territorial waters? Russia-Ukraine hostility explained.

"Prof He's university has denied any knowledge of the research, which has not been peer-reviewed A Chinese scientist who claims to have created the world's first genetically edited babies has defended his work. Speaking at a genome summit in Hong Kong, He Jiankui said he was ""proud"" of altering the genes of twin girls so they could not contract HIV. His work, which he announced earlier this week, has not been verified. Many scientists have condemned his announcement. Such gene-editing work is banned in most countries, including China. Professor He's university - the Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen - said it was unaware of the research project and would launch an investigation. It said Mr He had been on unpaid leave since February. Prof He confirmed the university was not aware, adding he had funded the experiment by himself. Prof He announced earlier this week that he had altered the DNA of embryos- twin girls - to prevent them from contracting HIV. On Wednesday, he spoke at the Human Genome Editing Summit at the University of Hong Kong for the first time about his work since the uproar. He revealed that the twin girls - known as ""Lulu"" and ""Nana"" - were ""born normal and healthy"", adding that there were plans to monitor the twins over the next 18 years. He explained that eight couples - comprised of HIV-positive fathers and HIV-negative mothers - had signed up voluntarily for the experiment; one couple later dropped out. Prof He has defended his work after widespread condemnation by the scientific community Prof He also said that the study had been submitted to a scientific journal for review, though he did not name the journal. He also said that ""another potential pregnancy"" of a gene-edited embryo was in its early stages. But he apologised that his research ""was leaked unexpectedly"", and added: ""The clinical trial was paused due to the current situation."" By Robin Brant, BBC News, Hong Kong No-one really knew if he was going to show. The auditorium was packed by the time He Jiankui walked on stage. This is the man who says he has given China a world first. The handful of experts I spoke to, after they'd sat and listened to him, said they believed him. They believe this happened. But the big, big problem was that his speech and answers afterwards were scant on detail. At times he was evasive, failing to give anything like the detail about his work - what he did, how he did it, who knew - that is required of any scientific project wishing to be regarded as credible. He talked about the stigma attached to HIV/Aids in China and how important the family is to society, but he didn't give the names of ""some experts"" he claimed had reviewed his work and offered feedback. The Crispr gene editing tool he claims to have used is not new to the scientific world, and was first discovered in 2012. It works by using ""molecular scissors"" to alter a very specific strand of DNA - either cutting it out, replacing it or tweaking it. Gene editing could potentially help avoid heritable diseases by deleting or changing troublesome coding in embryos. What is Crispr? Crispr: Human embryos and ethical concerns But experts worry meddling with the genome of an embryo could cause harm not only to the individual but also future generations that inherit these same changes. Prof He's recent claims were widely criticised by other scientists. Hundreds of Chinese scientists also signed a letter on social media condemning the research,external, saying they were ""resolutely"" opposed to it. ""If true, this experiment is monstrous. Gene editing itself is experimental and is still associated with off-target mutations, capable of causing genetic problems early and later in life, including the development of cancer,"" Prof Julian Savulescu, an ethics expert at the University of Oxford, told the BBC. ""This experiment exposes healthy normal children to risks of gene editing for no real necessary benefit."" Many countries, including the UK, have laws that prevent the use of genome editing in embryos for assisted reproduction in humans. Scientists can do gene editing research on discarded IVF embryos, as long as they are destroyed immediately afterwards and not used to make a baby. Prof He's experiment is prohibited under Chinese laws, Deputy Minister of Science and Technology Xu Nanping told state media. China allows in-vitro human embryonic stem cell research for a maximum period of 14 days, Mr Xu clarified.

"Nyall Brown took his own life while under the care of NSFT England's worst performing mental health trust has been rated inadequate for a third time, with patients trying to take their lives waiting for care. Norfolk and Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust (NSFT) had unsafe acute wards and was seriously understaffed. The Care Quality Commission (CQC) said bosses repeatedly failed to protect patients and a charity has called for the government to intervene. Trust chief Antek Lejk said its culture needed to change. Inspectors found patients left unsupervised in segregation, a high proportion of urgent referrals downgraded unsafely and that unfilled shifts led to 139 incidents in six months. However, adolescent and child mental health wards were rated outstanding. In its report, the watchdog said: ""We saw many situations where people were not offered a service yet had been in significant need. ""Records showed that, in some cases, patients had self-harmed or taken overdoses whilst waiting for contact."" NSFT is the only mental health trust in the country to have been put into special measures, a step first taken in February 2015. The trust came out of special measures in October 2016, only to have that status imposed again a year later. Mearl Brown said his son Nyall was not given help when he needed it Mearl Brown, from Cromer, Norfolk, sought help from the NSFT after his 19-year-old son Nyall first attempted to take his own life in January. He said the care was disorganised and at one point the Brown family were advised to seek private medical help for their son. Nyall went on to take his own life in May. Mr Brown described the family's dealings with the trust as ""inadequate, poor and shocking"". ""The help wasn't given to him when he needed it,"" he said. ""He was in a bad way when he left hospital and we were sent home with a ticking time bomb. ""Local support would have been beneficial - one of the first assessments Nyall did was a telephone interview. ""I think the biggest problem is a lot of these places work Monday to Friday, 9 until 5 - mental health is 24-7."" Health Secretary Matt Hancock, who is also Conservative MP for West Suffolk, said ""all options"" would be looked at to improve the service. ""On the day of the publication of the report is not the time to make an immediate kneejerk response, but I am absolutely clear that we need to address it,"" he said. ""We need to absolutely get it right and I am going to do it. ""Since 1948, when the NHS was established, mental health trusts have been separate from the rest of the NHS and we have got to ask if that is the right solution. ""As the local MP, I have been working on this issue for many years and the service is not good enough and has serious problems."" Paul Farmer, from mental health charity Mind, said the options available to a health secretary included having parts of the service taken over by another mental health trust. ""When a trust fails and then fails again, you have to ask questions about what action needs to be taken to change that."" The CQC's lead for mental health, Dr Paul Lelliott, said: ""Managers have not ensured that when things go wrong, they learn and share lessons to reduce the likelihood of the same thing happening again."" He said issues first raised in 2014 had still not been fully addressed. ""The trust leadership team has not taken action at the pace required to bring about sustained improvement and to resolve failings in safety,"" he said. â¢Patient died after leaving mental health unit â¢Ex-footballer found in 'zombie state' Mental health trust criticised over death The inspection body said it had asked NHS Improvement to support the trust to make immediate changes to keep patients safe, and would be monitoring. NSFT was rated inadequate in the areas of safety, management and response. It required improvement over the effectiveness of its services but was found to be good at being compassionate in its care for patients. Antek Lejk, the trust's chief executive, said: ""It is not a clinically-led organisation. ""We don't give power to our doctors and nurses to change things and make the decisions they need to do and we are going to change that. ""We are looking at creating new clinical leadership roles in the organisation."" Mr Lejk, who took over in May, said it was also working with ""one of the best mental health trusts in the country"" - the East London NHS Foundation Trust - to make improvements. He added 100 staff would be trained in a ""quality improvement initiative"" and would then go back on to wards and teams. ""Our priorities now will be to resolve ongoing issues around access to services, waiting lists, care planning and staffing levels, while also making sure we have the right systems in place to ensure patient safety at all times."" Norfolk MP Clive Lewis said the situation had become a national disgrace Clive Lewis, Labour MP for Norwich South, said: ""This has become a national disgrace. We are looking at a national and local system-wide failure of governance, commissioning, regulation and inspection,"" he said. ""Unless we change course, I know exactly what's coming next. Senior trust board members will mouth the same platitudes about lessons being learnt and plans for change - even though those same people have long track records of failure in various parts of the local NHS."" Mr Lewis said the CQC had ""the power to put the trust into Special Administration and get rid of this board"". North Norfolk Lib Dem MP Norman Lamb, who was a health minister in the coalition government, said it was ""totally intolerable for families and individuals affected"". In a statement, the Department of Health and Social Care said: ""NHS Improvement is providing intensive support to Norfolk and Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust to improve patient safety and deliver sustainable improvements. The situation is being monitored closely and we expect to see progress made in the coming weeks."" Following the report, trade union Unison said staff were ""working hard to do their best by patients despite low morale and ever-dwindling resources"". Regional organiser Peter Passingham said it was ""not surprising that the trust has failed to improve since its last inspection"" given ""the wounds inflicted by nearly a decade of austerity."" By Sophie Hutchinson, BBC News Health Correspondent Today's report by the Care Quality Commission catalogues a mountain of failings. It says significant concerns raised back in 2014 had still not been addressed and that in some cases the trust had created new risks. This is the third inspection in three years that the trust has failed and it is in unprecedented territory as the only mental health trust to have been placed in special measures. Now there are calls for radical and urgent action and for it to be placed in special administration. That's the NHS's so-called failure regime in which some parts of the trust or all of the trust are taken over. It would require the intervention of the health secretary. It's a measure of last resort only used twice before, but many mental health experts and local campaigners feel it is the only way to make these services safe.

"Prof He's university has denied any knowledge of the research, which has not been peer-reviewed A Chinese scientist who claims to have created the world's first genetically edited babies has defended his work. Speaking at a genome summit in Hong Kong, He Jiankui said he was ""proud"" of altering the genes of twin girls so they could not contract HIV. His work, which he announced earlier this week, has not been verified. Many scientists have condemned his announcement. Such gene-editing work is banned in most countries, including China. Professor He's university - the Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen - said it was unaware of the research project and would launch an investigation. It said Mr He had been on unpaid leave since February. Prof He confirmed the university was not aware, adding he had funded the experiment by himself. Prof He announced earlier this week that he had altered the DNA of embryos- twin girls - to prevent them from contracting HIV. On Wednesday, he spoke at the Human Genome Editing Summit at the University of Hong Kong for the first time about his work since the uproar. He revealed that the twin girls - known as ""Lulu"" and ""Nana"" - were ""born normal and healthy"", adding that there were plans to monitor the twins over the next 18 years. He explained that eight couples - comprised of HIV-positive fathers and HIV-negative mothers - had signed up voluntarily for the experiment; one couple later dropped out. Prof He has defended his work after widespread condemnation by the scientific community Prof He also said that the study had been submitted to a scientific journal for review, though he did not name the journal. He also said that ""another potential pregnancy"" of a gene-edited embryo was in its early stages. But he apologised that his research ""was leaked unexpectedly"", and added: ""The clinical trial was paused due to the current situation."" By Robin Brant, BBC News, Hong Kong No-one really knew if he was going to show. The auditorium was packed by the time He Jiankui walked on stage. This is the man who says he has given China a world first. The handful of experts I spoke to, after they'd sat and listened to him, said they believed him. They believe this happened. But the big, big problem was that his speech and answers afterwards were scant on detail. At times he was evasive, failing to give anything like the detail about his work - what he did, how he did it, who knew - that is required of any scientific project wishing to be regarded as credible.

"This video can not be played The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge visited the scene of the crash The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge paid tribute to the victims of the helicopter crash outside Leicester City's stadium on a visit to the city. Club chairman Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha and four others died when the aircraft came down on 27 October. The couple visited the crash site to meet players and hear about charities Mr Vichai supported, before going to the University of Leicester. Prince William has said he was lucky to have known Mr Vichai for several years. The former air ambulance helicopter pilot revealed during his visit he had flown with pilot Eric Swaffer, who died in the crash, only a few months before describing the experience as a ""privilege"". The Duchess of Cambridge laid flowers at the scene of the fatal helicopter crash Prince William personally knew Mr Vichai and described him as a man ""dedicated to his family"" On arriving at the King Power stadium, Prince William clasped the hand of club vice-chairman and Mr Vichai's son Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha with both of his and spoke intently to him, before introducing Catherine. Live: Royals visit helicopter crash site The Duchess left a bouquet of flowers at the crash site and a condolence card, signed by the couple, which read: ""To Vichai and all those who died in this terrible tragedy, you will be dearly missed. Our sincere condolences to the city of Leicester."" Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha, Mr Vichai's son, and Prince William were photographed hand-in-hand at the helicopter crash site The couple also met senior figures from Leicester City, including star striker Jamie Vardy, club captain Wes Morgan and manager Claude Puel Mathew Vieira was among those gathered outside the stadium to catch a glimpse of the couple and said he was there so his two-year-old daughter Layla could ""wave at a princess"". He said: ""It's nice of him [The Duke of Cambridge] to pay his respects. He's found time to come and share the grief of the whole club."" By David Pittam, BBC News, outside the King Power Stadium This was a visit for the royal couple to pay their respects Barriers were in place for a crowd of hundreds but in the end it was only a few dozen who braved the rain for this royal visit. And among those who did show up, the mood was a little subdued. There was the excitement of spotting the Prince and Duchess and there was a fair bit of flag waving as they drove by. But this was a visit for the royal couple to pay their respects and the crowd understood that. It's hard to forget that the helicopter crash was so near - and many people were just happy to see such high profile recognition of the tragedy. As one dad-of-four put it, they're ""sharing in our grief"". Inside the stadium there was a special message above the pitch to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. Prince William and Catherine also met members of the club's staff and volunteers who helped relocate the thousands of tributes left outside the King Power Stadium. A sign inside the stadium welcomed the royal couple Prince William, a keen football fan, and Catherine were given a tour of the stadium from Mr Vichai's son At the club, the Duke gave a speech where he said the club did ""something that should have been impossible"" by winning the Premier League in 2016. He said: ""Against odds that are now the stuff of legend, you took on the Goliaths and superstars of the world's most famous football league. ""In powering past them all to win the title, you wrote the best underdog story in the history of modern sport. ""And when the man that led this club to victory died so tragically, the people of this city revealed with their outpouring of admiration, that they too shared much of the character that was so central to who Vichai was. ""In a time when our football clubs have become huge global enterprises, you came out to thank Vichai for making the fans the true owners of this club."" Vice-chairman and Mr Vichai's son, Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha, and Mr Vichai's widow Aimon were at the crash site before the royal couple arrived Crowds cheered as Leicester City striker Jamie Vardy arrived During their visit to the university the Duke and Duchess heard of some of the educational programmes the club had helped to support. This included a Â£1m donation by Mr Vichai in May to treat and research life-threatening illnesses, a resuscitation programme and a programme which helped children learn and develop life skills. One of the children who has received help through a community project Mr Vichai supported, Sai Gokani, presented the Duchess with flowers and gave her a kiss before she left. He originally went in for a handshake, prompting laughter from those watching. Sai Gokani presented the Duchess with flowers and gave her a kiss Hundreds of people waited in the rain outside the University of Leicester for the royal couple Hundreds of students, staff and fans of the royals lined Centenary Square at the university to see the couple as they left. Braving the ran and cold, their spirits were not dampened by the time the couple emerged from the university library and they walked out to a chorus of cheers from the crowds, said BBC reporter Nick Smith. The couple smiled and waved to the cheering crowd at the University of Leicester Prince William, pictured with Mr Vichai, previously paid tribute to the late chairman after the crash Prince William, who is president of the Football Association, personally knew Mr Vichai and previously described him as a man ""dedicated to his family"". Mr Aiyawatt said it was an ""honour"" to welcome the royal couple to the King Power Stadium. He added: ""For their Royal Highnesses to visit the city to pay their respects personally is a remarkable gesture of compassion to the families of those who lost their lives, to the staff and players of the club and to the people of the city whose lives were touched by my father.""

"Theresa May has denied claims from DUP leader Arlene Foster that she had ""given up"" on negotiations before agreeing the Brexit deal. Mrs Foster said the PM's trip to promote the deal to businesses in Wales and Northern Ireland was a ""waste of time"" as Parliament would not back it. Meanwhile, former defence secretary Sir Michael Fallon told the BBC the deal was ""doomed"" and must be renegotiated. Mrs May insists it protects the ""vital interests"" of the whole of the UK. After enduring criticism of the Brexit withdrawal agreement in the Commons on Monday, the prime minister began the next day rejecting US President Donald Trump's suggestions that the deal could threaten future US-UK trade deals. Reality Check: Is Trump right about the Brexit deal? A guide to where we are with Brexit PM's push to sell Brexit plan comes to NI Brexit: All you need to know And as she travelled to Wales and Northern Ireland, promising that her Brexit plans would strengthen ""every corner"" of the UK, she came under fire from Mrs Foster, whose party has a parliamentary pact to support the Conservative government in key votes. This video can not be played Foster: This is not the right deal for Northern Ireland ""The disappointing thing for me is that the prime minister has given up and she is saying... we just have to accept it,"" Mrs Foster told the BBC's political editor, Laura Kuenssberg. ""She may have given up on further negotiations and trying to find a better deal but I have not."" Sir Michael Fallon's decision to come out against the deal is another blow to the prime minister, who is struggling to muster support in Parliament ahead of a Commons vote on 11 December. Labour, the Lib Dems, SNP and Democratic Unionists have all said they will reject the terms of the UK's withdrawal, and future relations negotiated by Mrs May. Kuenssberg: An impossible task for PM? Reality Check: The challenges ahead for a UK/US trade deal after Brexit Many Tories have also said publicly they are opposed to Mrs May's Brexit deal with the EU. Brexiteers fear it will keep the UK too closely tied to EU rules, making it harder to strike future trade deals with other countries. IfMPs voted against the deal, the government would have up to 21 days to tell the Commons ""how it proposes to proceed"" and a further seven to move a motion allowing MPs to express their views. New laws would have to be passed if the UK wanted to avoid the default position of leaving without a deal on 29 March next year. This video can not be played Former Defence Secretary Michael Fallon says negotiators should be sent back to Brussels Sir Michael, who was previously regarded as a loyalist, now argues that Mrs May's deal ""would see the UK give up its power to influence EU rules and regulations in return for vague assurances over future trade"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was the ""worst of all worlds"" and that Mr Trump's criticism of its repercussions for transatlantic relations ""could not simply be brushed off"". However, the prime minister is continuing to make the case for the agreement, which she says delivers on the 2016 referendum vote in key areas and is in the national interest. Mrs May has said Welsh farmers will enjoy a brighter future outside the Common Agricultural Policy During a visit to an agricultural show in Builth Wells in Powys, Mrs May said: ""We have already been talking to [the US] about the sort of agreement that we could have in the future... that is working very well."" When it was put to her that Mrs Foster had implied she ""rolled over"", Mrs May replied: ""No, we have been resisting many of the things that the European Union wanted to put in this deal. When you negotiate neither side gets 100% of what they want."" Speaking later, in Northern Ireland, Mrs May said she had been given a ""clear message"" by businesses that the deal was in the national interest as it provided certainty. ""The overwhelming message I get is this is a deal that does deliver for constituents,"" she added. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Under the proposed agreement, the UK would not be able to bring into force any trade deal with a country outside the EU until the end of the proposed transition period - currently scheduled to last until 31 December 2020. In reality, any bilateral agreement between the UK and the US is likely to take years to negotiate given its complexity, differing standards in areas such as agriculture, and the fact it would require ratification by the US Congress.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock told an MPs' committee that invitations to tender had been issued for refrigeration and storage worth ""in the low tens of millions"" Sir Michael said the 29 March 2019 date for Brexit, which is enshrined in UK law, may have to be pushed back to give negotiators the time to make major improvements to the agreement. All 28 EU states would need to agree to extend the Article 50 process of negotiations to allow this to happen, something Theresa May has repeatedly ruled out. Cabinet Office David Lidington said he did not think doing this ""would get us anywhere"" as the EU had made clear this was the only deal on the table. He told Today there was no ""Plan B"" and the agreement was a ""decent compromise"" which would provide a springboard to the next stage of negotiations on the two sides' future relationship.

"The UK will be poorer economically under any form of Brexit, compared with staying in the EU, new government analysis suggests. Official figures say the UK economy could be up to 3.9% smaller after 15 years under Theresa May's Brexit plan, compared with staying in the EU. But a no-deal Brexit could deliver a 9.3% hit, the new estimates say. The prime minister said her deal was the best one available for jobs and the economy. ""Our deal is the best deal available for jobs and our economy, that allows us to honour the referendum and realise the opportunities of Brexit,"" Mrs May said at Prime Minister's Questions. The government's Brexit deal faces a potentially difficult vote in the House of Commons on 11 December. Before that Mrs May is touring the country to promote the deal and was due to be in Scotland on Wednesday afternoon. Reality Check: Can forecasts get it wrong? May defends Brexit deal Davis attacks 'flawed' Brexit forecasts A guide to where we are with Brexit Reality Check: Is Trump right about the Brexit deal? Confusinglythe 83-page document does not,externalforecast the impact of the prime minister's current deal. Instead it looks at the potential impact of the proposals agreed by the Cabinet at Chequers in July, which is the basis of the current proposal. Under those circumstances the economy would be 3.9% smaller than if the UK had remained part of the European Union. The estimates do not put a cash figure on the potential impact on the economy, but independent experts have said that 3.9% of GDP would equate to about Â£100bn a year by the 2030s. The government report also examines three other possible scenarios including a no-deal Brexit, which would be the most damaging. The economy will continue to grow under all the scenarios, but there is a wide variation in how much. Former Brexit Secretary David Davis questioned the research, saying previous Treasury forecasts had been proved wrong and were based on ""flawed assumptions"". Chancellor Philip Hammond said the planned Brexit deal combined most of the economic benefits of remaining in the EU with the political benefits of leaving the EU. Asked if the UK would be poorer under Mrs May's deal, he said: ""The economy will be slightly smaller in the prime minister's preferred version of the future partnership."" But Mr Hammond argued that staying in the EU was not politically ""viable"". Veteran Conservative Eurosceptic Sir Bill Cash said Mr Hammond was effectively arguing for the UK to stay in the European Union in his ""extraordinary"" statement. He said the chancellor had ignored potential economic benefits of leaving the EU, asking: ""What about the trade deals which could give us the most enormous opportunities throughout the world, if we are able to strike them?"" Under Mrs May's deal, the UK would be able to negotiate trade deals during the transition period after 29 March's Brexit day, but would not be able to implement them until the end of the planned 21-month transition period, which could itself be extended. By Andrew Walker, BBC economics correspondent This exercise doesn't predict how much the economy will grow over the 15-year period, but rather the impact of specific changes in Britain's trade relationships, other things being equal. That is after all the question we want answered. One problem is that it will be harder to judge when we look back whether the figures were right, because we would be comparing what actually happened with a hypothetical alternative that didn't. The same applies to the impact on the government's finances. That said, all the scenarios in the analysis show an adverse effect; the saving on contributions to the EU is more than offset by the lower tax revenues that would result from the weaker economic growth. There are also some striking differences in regional economic impacts. In the no-deal situation the biggest effects are in North East England and the West Midlands. London gets away with least damage in that situation, but the capital is worst hit in the government's preferred option. That is because London specialises in services that would gain less, compared to no deal, than manufacturing from the relationship the government is seeking to negotiate.

"This video can not be played Theresa May insisted her deal would protect jobs and provide new opportunities for exporters The prime minister has insisted her Brexit agreement is a ""good deal for Scotland"" that will protect jobs and provide new opportunities for business. Theresa May was speaking as she met factory workers in Renfrewshire as she seeks to build support for the plan. Her proposals have faced strong criticism from opposition parties - as well as from many of her own MPs. But she says the country is facing a straight choice between her deal, or leaving the EU without any deal. Ahead of Mrs May's visit to Scotland, the UK government published analysis which suggested the country's economy could be up to 3.9% smaller after 15 years under her Brexit plan, compared with staying in the EU - but that a no-deal Brexit could deliver a 9.3% hit. The Bank of England subsequently warned that a no-deal Brexit would send the pound plunging and trigger a worse recession than the financial crisis. Brexit will make UK worse off, government warns No-deal Brexit could sink UK into recession A guide to where we are with Brexit Mrs May's proposals are opposed by Labour, the SNP, Liberal Democrats, the Democratic Unionists and many Conservative MPs on both sides of the Brexit debate - meaning she currently looks unlikely to get parliamentary approval for her deal. On Tuesday, First Minister Nicola Sturgeonunveiled a Scottish government analysis paperwhich claimed the Brexit deal could cost Scotland Â£9bn a year by 2030, compared to if it had remained in the EU. Ms Sturgeon, who wants the UK to remain permanently in the single market and customs union and has backed calls for another referendum on the Brexit terms, has said the SNP's 35 MPs at Westminster will vote against the deal on 11 December. Nicola Sturgeon unveiled Scottish government analysis of the deal at her Bute House residence on Tuesday But the prime minister said the deal she had negotiated for the UK would be a ""good deal for Scotland"" as it would provide a ""free trade area with no tariffs, no fees"". She added: ""That will mean a opportunity to carry on their trade. but also gives us the opportunity to negotiate trade deals around the world that will be good for great Scottish exports like Scotch Whisky, Scottish salmon and smoked salmon. ""So this is a deal that is right for Scotland and right for Scottish fishermen, because we'll take back control of our waters and ensure they have a bright future for Scottish fishing."" Why is everyone talking about fishing? What happens if MPs reject Brexit deal? Why the Irish border is a big deal in Scotland Labour's shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has suggested it is ""inevitable"" another EU referendum will be called if Labour are not able to force a general election. But Mrs May said his comments were proof that Labour ""want to go against and overturn the vote of the British people"". The UK government has highlighted the support the deal has received in recent days from Diageo, National Farming Union Scotland, the Scotch Whisky Association and BAE Systems, who have also warned about the consequences of ""no deal"" for Scotland. Jim Ratcliffe - the owner of chemicals giant Ineos, which operates the Grangemouth facility - has also said Mrs May's deal had his ""full support"", describing it as a ""pragmatic and sensible arrangement"". The company said its analysis showed a no-deal Brexit would carry ""significant risk"" for its business, and urged MPs to ""put the good of the country ahead of political considerations and ensure a safe passage for the deal through Parliament.""

On Tuesday, the prime minister made similar visits to Wales and Northern Ireland - where she faced criticism from Democratic Unionist leader Arlene Foster, whose party has a parliamentary pact to support the Conservative government in key votes. And speaking as she unveiled the Scottish government's latest Brexit analysis paper, Ms Sturgeon said the deal was ""unacceptable to the Scottish government and damaging to the people of Scotland"". The document included analysis - first published in January - claiming that a new free trade agreement could leave Scots Â£1,600 worse off per year by 2030, compared to a scenario where the UK remains in the EU. It also warned the ""backstop"" being put in place to prevent the return to a hard border in Ireland could leave Scotland at a ""serious competitive disadvantage"" to Northern Ireland. Ms Sturgeon said: ""It will not end uncertainty. It will extend it. We are being asked to accept a blindfold Brexit with all the difficult decisions kicked down the road.""

"There is a ""real prospect"" of ""major disruption"" at UK ports in the case of a no-deal Brexit, according to MPs. The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) said government preparations for avoiding disruption around major ports were ""worryingly under-developed"". Committee members also said there was a ""real risk"" the Department for Transport (DfT) would not be ready for a hard Brexit. The DfT said the committee's conclusions were not ""accurate"". In a statement it said it was ""both disappointed and surprised"" that the PAC had ""failed to reflect"" the evidence in the National Audit Office's report ""which found that the department has made a determined effort in its preparations and achieved a great deal"". The UK is set to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. The PAC is responsible for scrutinising the value for money of public spending, and holding the government to account for the delivery of public services. It has published a series of reports looking at different government departments' preparations for Brexit. As with these previous reports, it was ""concerned about how well government is prepared"". Brexit: Exports 'could be stuck at border' Defra 'in dark' over Brexit preparations No urgency in Brexit planning MPs warn Committee chairwoman Meg Hillier said: ""The future of road, rail, maritime and air access to Europe after Brexit remains unclear and the Department for Transport has a critical role in ensuring the UK is prepared. ""With so little time remaining, there is still much to do. The risks associated with no-deal are severe, yet plans for avoiding disruption around major ports in particular are worryingly under-developed."" The DfT intends to introduce ""Project Brock"", to deal with lorry queues on roads to Dover for cross-Channel journeys. The plan involves holding coast-bound lorries on the M20 so traffic not heading for the port can carry on moving. Much of the criticism in this report from MPs is centred on the notion that the Department for Transport (DfT)'s preparations for a ""no deal"" scenario have been too secretive. They argue that it makes it harder for the wider business community to plan. We have known for some time now that the government has been using non-disclosure agreements when it has been discussing no-deal plans with transport companies. Some details have leaked out. For example, I've been told that officials have been asking ferry companies about their capacity to carry vital supplies in the event of EU customs checks causing disruption at the border. The DfT says preparations need to be kept secret to avoid them damaging the commercial interests of the firms involved. And details of Operation Brock, the department's Â£35m plan to keep traffic flowing freely on the M20 near Dover, have been published, as well as other preparatory schemes, like the one to ensure that holiday-makers travelling to the EU can access international driving permits. However, the Public Accounts Committee feels it hasn't been able to properly scrutinise many aspects of the department's no-deal planning and it argues that has contributed to its perception, outlined in this report, that the DfT is being ""complacent"" and that there is a risk that our transport systems and infrastructure won't be sufficiently prepared for ""no deal"" come 29 March. Ms Hillier said the DfT planned to spend Â£30-Â£35m on Project Brock, but had not yet carried out proposed ""desk-based"" testing. Engagement with businesses had been ""poor"", she added. ""The secrecy around the department's preparations and the shortcomings in assurance on its progress are a potentially toxic combination."" The PAC recommended that the DfT should write to it before Christmas ""setting out the results of any testing of Project Brock, and how wider plans to keep ports across the UK open for business have progressed"". The Road Haulage Association's chief executive Richard Burnett said the report had confirmed what many members had told the body. ""Information has been patchy, often unhelpful, confusing and generally too little, too late,"" he said. ""This has left hauliers at the sharp end of a bad Brexit outcome, struggling to keep the supply chain operating and their firms in business."" The PAC said it acknowledged the ""difficult situation"" for the DfT in having to prepared for all Brexit scenarios. However, it felt the department must be ""open about the challenges it faces and work with business and stakeholders to help them get ready for what the future brings"".

"Some of the detained Ukrainians have appeared in court in Crimea US President Donald Trump says he may cancel a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin following a maritime clash between Russia and Ukraine. Mr Trump told the Washington Post he was waiting for a ""full report"" after Russian ships fired on and seized three Ukrainian boats on Sunday. Ukraine described it as an ""act of aggression"" but Russia said the ships had illegally entered its waters. Martial law has been imposed in parts of Ukraine, in an unprecedented move. Meanwhile, the US has urged European states to do more to support Ukraine. State department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said Washington wanted to see tougher enforcement of sanctions against Russia. Mr Trump and Mr Putin are due to meet on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Buenos Aires later this week. However, Mr Trump told the Washington Post that the report coming from his national security team would be ""very determinative"". ""Maybe I won't have the meeting [with Mr Putin].,externalMaybe I won't even have the meeting. I don't like that aggression. I don't want that aggression at all,"" he said. The two men are scheduled to discuss security, arms control, and issues in Ukraine and the Middle East when the summit convenes on Friday and Saturday, national security adviser John Bolton told reporters. This video can not be played Why tensions between Russia and Ukraine are so high Stakes are high in Ukraine-Russia sea clash Crimea: Who controls its territorial waters? Russian coastguard ships opened fire on Sunday as the two Ukrainian gunboats and a tug sailed through the Kerch Strait off the coast of Crimea, which was annexed by Russia in 2014. Twenty-four Ukrainians were detained and at least three were wounded in the incident. A Crimean court later ordered that 12 of the Ukrainians be detained for 60 days. The court is expected to issue rulings for the remaining servicemen on Wednesday. The FSB security service has since released videos of some of the men making statements. One of them, Volodymyr Lisovyi, said he was aware of the ""provocative nature"" of the Ukrainian action. Volodymyr Lisovyi was one of three men who gave statements described as ""under duress"" by the head of Ukraine's navy Another, Andriy Drach, said he had been on a gunboat with an order to sail from Odessa to Mariupol. ""We were warned by the border service of the Russian Federation that we were violating Russian law. They had repeatedly asked us to leave the territorial waters of the Russian Federation,"" he said. Ukraine's navy commander, Ihor Voronchenko, told Ukrainian TV that the men had given false statements under duress. Russia-Ukraine sea clash in 300 words Russia 'bigger threat than IS' - Army chief Eastern Ukraine: A new, bloody chapter ""I know those sailors from Nikopol. They have always been honest professionals in their jobs, and what they say now is not true,"" he said. The head of Ukraine's SBU security service, Vasyl Hrytsak, confirmed Russian reports that members of the service were on board the boats, but added that it was a ""routine counter-intelligence mission"" of a type that the Russian navy carried out regularly. On Tuesday, President Petro Poroshenko said there was a threat of ""full-scale war"" with Russia. ""The number of [Russian] tanks at bases located along our border has grown three times,"" he said. On Monday night, Ukraine's parliament backed President Poroshenko's decision to impose martial law for a 30-day period from 28 November in 10 border regions. Five of the 10 regions border Russia while two are adjacent to Moldova's breakaway Trans-Dniester region, where Russian troops are stationed. The other three regions border the Black Sea or Sea of Azov close to Crimea. The move to martial law is unprecedented in Ukraine, and gives military authorities the right to ban protests and strikes. The flare-up is the first outright clash between Ukraine and Russian forces for years, although since 2014 pro-Russian separatists and Russian military ""volunteers"" have been fighting Ukraine's army in two eastern regions - Luhansk and Donetsk. Tensions escalated when Russia opened a bridge this year between Russia and Crimea over the Kerch Strait, which leads into the Sea of Azov. Ukraine has two big ports on the northern shore of the Azov sea, and a 2003 treaty allows both countries free access to its waters. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said the seizure of Ukrainian ships is a ""dangerous escalation and a violation of international law"". The UK condemned Russia's ""destabilising behaviour in the region and its ongoing violation of Ukrainian territorial sovereignty"". Taking a call from German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Vladimir Putin argued that the Ukrainians had ""deliberately ignored the rules of peaceful passage in the territorial sea of the Russian Federation"", the Kremlin said. Mrs Merkel had ""stressed the need for de-escalation and dialogue,"" her spokesman said. Crimea: Who controls its territorial waters? Russia-Ukraine hostility explained.

The performance had a lot of good things and a lot of disappointing things too. ""We lost too many chances, crucial ones in crucial moments. This is the kind of game if you score in the first minute you normally go for a different performance. You could pay with a draw and with a defeat too. David de Gea only had one save but it looks a phenomenal save, a save that best goalkeeper in the world does and gives his team the possibility to win the match. ""We had more than one chance, we had a lot of half chances. It is not about blaming one player who missed a chance at the beginning of the game. ""Goals win games. I am happy with Marcus Rashford's intensity, the way we started and the intention we showed but then it is not easy to cope with the frustration and result that does not suit us. ""The most important thing is to qualify and for some of my lovers, and those that like stats, I am 14 seasons in the Champions League and 14 times my teams have qualified through to the group stages.

We didnât play to be in trouble until the last minute. I was
frustrated we couldnât score. My players were very tired at the end. Thatâs
what I want. Without David de Geaâs save, no winning goal. We qualified. We did it. âHe is the best goalkeeper in the world. If our ambitions
are to have the best in the world, we have to keep him. ""Realistically to be in the last 16 is an achievement,
not a big one or a fantastic one, but an achievement. There are better teams
than us. Teams with more quality and realistic ambitions. When a team arrives
in the quarter-finals, anything can happen.â Text 81111 (UK only). Pathetic behaviour from Mourinho yet again.

"Geoffrey Hutton has been found guilty of murdering debt collector Tina Cantello A man who stabbed a debt collector 30 times after she visited him to collect some money has been found guilty of murder. Geoffrey Hutton, 38, murdered Tina Cantello at his home in Langdon Hills, Essex, in June. Her partially-clothed body was found upstairs in a bedroom. After a two-week trial at Snaresbrook Crown Court, jurors took two hours to convict Hutton of killing the 49-year-old mother-of-four. He will be sentenced on Wednesday. The court heard how Ms Cantello, who worked for Provident Financial, visited Hutton at his home in Derby Close at about 17:30 BST on 8 June. She was reported missing by her family after she failed to return home. Tina Cantello worked as a debt collector making door-to-door visits Almost 24 hours later, police were called to the scene after a neighbour recognised Ms Cantello's car from the missing person's appeal. Hutton, who is deaf, emerged from the house covered in blood and officers went on to find the debt collector's ""largely naked"" body in a bedroom. She had suffered 30 stab wounds and 17 further injuries. During the trial, Hutton claimed an unknown intruder had carried out the killing but jurors heard his DNA was found on the body and murder weapon. They were also told he had bought drugs and went online to search for porn soon after the debt collector was killed. Ms Cantello's body was found at a property in Derby Close, Langdon Hills In a statement, Ms Cantello's family said they would ""refuse to allow Hutton's violent, vile and depraved actions to become her defining moment"". They said Hutton had ""deliberately sought to exploit his hearing impairment to deceive the court"" and ""piled insult onto injury"" by refusing to take responsibility for his actions. Branding him ""callous and calculated"", the statement added: ""No punishment would be commensurate with Hutton's grievous actions. His flagrant lack of remorse and atonement means he will never find forgiveness.""
