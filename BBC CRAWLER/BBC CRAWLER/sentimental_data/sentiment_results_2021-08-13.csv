"Apple says its announcement of automated tools to detect child sexual abuse on the iPhone and iPad was ""jumbled pretty badly"". On 5 August, the company revealed new image detection software that can alert Apple if known illegal images are uploaded to its iCloud storage. Privacy groups criticised the news, with some saying Apple had created a security backdoor in its software. The company says its announcement had been widely ""misunderstood"". ""We wish that this had come out a little more clearly for everyone,"" said Apple software chief Craig Federighi,in an interview with the Wall Street Journal,external. He said that - in hindsight - introducing two features at the same time was ""a recipe for this kind of confusion"". Apple announced two new tools designed to protect children. They will be deployed in the US first. Image detection The first tool can identify known child sex abuse material (CSAM) when a user uploads photos to iCloud storage. The US National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) maintains a database of known illegal child abuse images. It stores them as hashes - a digital ""fingerprint"" of the illegal material. Cloud service providers such as Facebook, Google and Microsoft, already check images against these hashes to make sure people are not sharing CSAM. Apple's software chief Craig Federighi said messages had been ""jumbled"" Apple decided to implement a similar process, but said it would do the image-matching on a user's iPhone or iPad, before it was uploaded to iCloud. Mr Federighi said the iPhone would not be checking for things such as photos of your children in the bath, or looking for pornography. The system could only match ""exact fingerprints"" of specific known child sexual abuse images, he said. If a user tries to upload several images that match child abuse fingerprints, their account will be flagged to Apple so the specific images can be reviewed. Mr Federighi said a user would have to upload in the region of 30 matching images before this feature would be triggered. Message filtering In addition to the iCloud tool, Apple also announced a parental control that users could activate on their children's accounts. If activated, the system would check photographs sent by - or to - the child over Apple's iMessage app. If the machine learning system judged that a photo contained nudity, it would obscure the photo and warn the child. Parents can also choose to receive an alert if the child chooses to view the photo. Privacy groups have shared concerns that the technology could be expanded and used by authoritarian governments to spy on its own citizens. WhatsApp head Will Cathcart called Apple's move ""very concerning"" while US whistleblower Edward Snowden called the iPhone a ""spyPhone"". Mr Federighi said the ""soundbyte"" that spread after the announcement was that Apple was scanning iPhones for images. ""That is not what is happening,"" he told the Wall Street Journal. ""We feel very positively and strongly about what we're doing and we can see that it's been widely misunderstood."" The tools are due to be added to the new versions of iOS and iPadOS later this year.

"The cost of NHS coronavirus tests for international arrivals to the UK have been reduced, the government has said. Test and Trace tests have been cut from Â£88 to Â£68 for people arriving from green-listed countries and for those coming from amber-listed countries who are fully vaccinated. Meanwhile, the price of two tests for amber arrivals who have not had both jabs has been cut from Â£170 to Â£136. The prices of all providers of day two and eight tests are to be reviewed. It comes after Health Secretary Sajid Javid asked the competition watchdog to investigate""excessive"" pricing and ""exploitative practices"" among PCR Covid test firms. He said misleading pricing will be clamped down on and providers failing to meet necessary standards will be removed from the government's approved list. NHS Test and Trace advertises its tests alongside private companies' packages and they are available to purchase to fulfil the government's testing requirements for international travel. This is the second time the price of NHS tests has been reduced; previously the cost of a day two and eight package was Â£210. It is understood that if the review finds private companies are offering terms that are unfair and therefore unenforceable, enforcement action could be taken by the Competition and Markets Authority or Trading Standards. If businesses are found to have breached consumer law, they could be subject to a court order to stop operating and told to compensate consumers. ""I am determined to protect consumers and hardworking families from exploitative practices and ensure high quality tests are available at a reasonable price,"" said Mr Javid. ""Too many providers are acting like cowboys and that needs to stop. The public should be allowed to enjoy their summer holidays without having to face excessive costs or anxiety. ""Any provider found to be misleading the public will be kicked off."" Holidaymakers have complained of high prices and poor service from many of the 400-plus firms offering PCR tests and there have been reports that some have not got full accreditation. According to reports, PCR test prices can range from as little as Â£20 to more than Â£500. There have also been complaints from consumers that they have not received test results or have been sent damaged PCR kits. The government said providers must use laboratories that are either accredited or undergoing accreditation by the independent United Kingdom Accreditation Service, and that businesses that fail to meet standards will be removed from its list of approved providers. The CMA has previously said formal investigations can take a long time, but in this instance it will provide advice to Mr Javid with a view to taking swift action.

"Banksy has confirmed pieces of street art in Norfolk and Suffolk - including this one in Great Yarmouth - are genuine Banksy has confirmed 10 pieces of street art that have appeared along the east coast of England are by him. People have flocked to see the pieces that began appearing a week ago in Great Yarmouth, Gorleston and Cromer, Norfolk; and Lowestoft and Oulton Broad in Suffolk. While many believed they were by Banksy, the famously secretive artist remained silent. However, he has now claimed responsibility via hisInstagram,externalpage. Is this Banksy? An Instagram video shows a hooded figure spraying the rat mural on the sea wall in Lowestoft The first of the murals - a couple appearing to dance atop a bus shelter, accompanied by a man playing an accordion - came to light in Admiralty Road, Great Yarmouth, quickly followed by an arcade-style toy-grabbing crane in Gorleston, and a child holding a crowbar in Lowestoft. Other suspected Banksy works showed three children in a boat in Oulton Broad, a giant gull scavenging ""chips"" from a skip and a cocktail-sipping rat reclining in a deckchair, both in Lowestoft, and a group of hermit crabs in Cromer. A guide to Banksy's 'Great British Spraycation' Arguably the most unusual piece was discovered on Sunday morning at Merrivale Model Village in Great Yarmouth. A new model of a miniature stable appeared, featuring a stencilled rat character and the slogan ""Go big or go home"" and apparently signed by the artist. A miniature thatched stable signed by the secretive graffiti artist appeared at Merrivale Model Village A child is depicted building a sandcastle with a crowbar on London Road North, Lowestoft Banksy confirmed he was the creator of the murals by sharing a video on his Instagram page of him travelling to each site in a campervan, titled ""A Great British Spraycation"". Walking along a beach with a cool box containing spray paint, the artist is first seen completing the mural of the cocktail-sipping rodent before venturing to the other locations. Rodents are often featured in Banksy's work The video also features reactions from passers-by, with one woman describing the mural of a girl building a sandcastle with a crowbar next to a broken paving slab as ""mindless vandalism"". While some were not impressed by the new installations, one Instagram user commented on the video saying: ""Thanks for your art in my hometown (Lowestoft), I went and enjoyed them all yesterday."" The statue of Frederick Savage was given some new accessories in the form of a fake ice cream and tongue The pieces had been the talk of the town since appearing last Friday, but some of the artist's works had gone largely unnoticed until the video and a list on Banksy's website was released. A fake ice cream cone and tongue were added to the statue of Frederick Savage, the mayor of King's Lynn between 1889 and 1890, which stands on Guanock Place. A mural of two children being flung into the air in an inflatable boat as an adult pumps it up while drinking was also part of Banksy's ""spraycation"". It was painted at Gorleston's model boat pond. Banksy listed this mural on his website as part of his ""Great British Spraycation"" In the final shot of a video on Bansky's Instagram page, a motorhome can be seen driving away from Merrivale Model Village Find BBC News: East of England onFacebook,external,Instagram,externalandTwitter,external.

"A first glimpse of the new Lord of the Rings TV series Production of the new Lord of the Rings television series will move to the UK from New Zealand, Amazon Studios has confirmed. The as-yet-untitled fantasy epic is set thousands of years before the events in JRR Tolkien's books The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. It is a major blow for New Zealand's entertainment industry where the award-winning movies were also filmed. UK culture secretary Oliver Dowden welcomed the decision. He said: ""Thousands of high quality jobs all across the UK will be created and supported by The Lord of the Rings television series so this is very exciting news."" The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport and the Treasury have been approached for comment on whether Amazon Studios has been offered financial subsidies to move production to the UK. The Hobbit: How England inspired Tolkien's Middle Earth Amazon Studios, the film and TV arm of the technology giant, has already spent $465m (Â£336.5m) on the first season of the show. It said the shift in locations was part of a plan to expand its production space and consolidate its footprint in the UK. The first season of the show will finish filming in New Zealand and will be shown on Amazon Prime in September 2022. Production will then move to the UK and four more seasons of the show are expected to be made. New Zealand's economic development minister Stuart Nash said the government was ""disappointed"" by the decision. In April, the New Zealand government had granted Amazon Studios extra subsidies on its production. Amazon was already receiving a 20% rebate on its expenses for filming The Lord of the Ring series in New Zealand before the government added an extra 5%. At the time, Mr Nash said the agreement with Amazon generated ""local jobs and creates work for local businesses"" and would ""enable a new wave of international tourism branding and promotion for this country"". Commenting on the decision to move production from New Zealand, Mr Nash said the country's film industry was ""incredibly competitive and highly mobile"". ""We have no regrets about giving this production our best shot with government support,"" he said. Amazon said it would not ""actively pursue"" the additional 5% subsidy it had been granted. The Lord of the Rings trilogy, starring Elijah Wood and Sean Astin, was filmed in New Zealand Vernon Sanders, vice president and co-head of TV at Amazon Studios thanked ""the people and the government of New Zealand for their hospitality and dedication and for providing The Lord of the Rings series with an incredible place to begin this epic journey."" New Zealand's dramatic landscapes were also home to Oscar-winning director Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit movie trilogies. The first Lord of the Rings film, The Fellowship of the Ring, was released in December 2001 and the final part of the trilogy was screened in 2003. The popularity of the films helped promote New Zealand's tourist industry. Between 2001 and 2006, annual tourists to the country rose by 40% from 1.7 million to 2.4 million,according to a report,external.

"France has recently introduced a new health pass which means proof of vaccination is needed to enter amenities People living in Scotland have spoken of holiday stress and frustration caused by the Scottish government's vaccine certificate system. Other UK nations use apps which provide a QR code as proof of vaccination, in line with a system used across Europe. However, people in Scotland have to request a paper certificate sent by post, which countries may not accept. Travel agents say Scottish travellers have been ""blindsided"" and in some cases may have to endure quarantines. The EU Digital Covid Certificate is available in all 27 member nations - plus Switzerland, Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein. The EU vaccine 'passport' and what it means for travel Do I need a vaccine certificate to travel? France rolls out health pass as cases soar Because the UK is no longer in the EU, the certificate is not available to most Britons, leading to a number of problems. The Scottish government has said it hopes to introduce a digital scheme next month. French-born Virginie Brouard, who owns the Edinburgh wine bar and restaurant Le De-Vin, travelled to Brittany in France with her children to visit her parents - whom she had not seen in two and a half years. France has recentlyrolled out a new health passwhich means people need proof of vaccination to enter places such as museums and cinemas. Virginie said she did not experience issues getting into the country, but said she was turned away from a cafÃ© because she did not have a QR code. She said there is concern in the area that if checks are not done correctly, businesses could close. She told BBC Radio Scotland'sDrivetime with John Beattie: ""It's been a stressful holiday to be honest. They don't like the piece of paper, they are all asking for a QR code and it's all on the phone - I'm lucky that Brittany is a bit more laid back. Virginie does not agree with mandatory vaccination certificates ""They don't really like the AstraZeneca vaccine either but I have only been rejected once - we just went for a coffee, I went to order and when the woman came to check our vaccine passport I said I only had the paper. ""She said she didn't want us to stay. That was not nice, I have to say I'm not too happy with the entire situation."" Virginie said her Â£400 bill for PCR tests had caused further stress as she could not be assured her family's results would arrive on time for their return journey on Sunday. However, she believes asking people to prove their vaccination status is not just impractical, but a moral issue. ""We have to respect everybody's situation,""she said. ""I'm not a scientist or politician but I don't like it - it's not right, especially when there is no vaccination for children. ""As a business owner there's no way I'm going to pay somebody to sit at the door and ask my customers for a vaccine passport.""

Last August, businessman Derek Douglas took his yacht to Bergen on the west coast of Norway, where it has been stranded ever since. The 67-year-old former chairman of Maggie's Centres has been attempting to re-enter Norway over the summer, but cannot get permission from the authorities because of his paper vaccine certificate. The country only accepts Norwegian, Danish, Swedish or EU digital Covid certificates as proof of vaccination or previous illness. Derek Douglas' yacht is stranded in Norway Derek said: ""I've spoken to the guy in charge of the border police at Bergen airport and offered my NHS login details but they said they can't do that - they can only scan QR codes. ""I don't mind not being able to access amenities but I've left my boat there since August. It's more frustrating as it looks like the Scottish government weren't looking ahead, someone should have woken up to the idea. ""I can't have a holiday in Norway - I wanted to go exploring and can't do that as most people stop sailing at the end of September due to the wind and low temperatures. It was supposed to be a bit of an adventure. I'm an older guy and you've got to pack these things in while you can."" Digital vaccine certificates to replace paper versions Last month the Scottish government confirmed that a digital scheme would replace the paper vaccination certificates. It awarded a Â£600,000 contract to a Danish firm to develop the digital system, which is expected to launch in September. The Scottish government said: ""We are developing an app to make it easier to show Covid status for international travel. ""This will include vaccination records and we aim to release this next month."" However Linda Hill, of the West Kilbride travel agent LAH Travel and part of the Scottish Passenger Agents Association, told the BBC she was ""dumbfounded"" by the Scottish government's decision to continue posting certificates by first-class mail. She said: ""The cost of that when the rest of the UK has a digital pass, I don't understand why we're not all just using the same thing. ""The protocols for every destination are so different - it's a very challenging time to have to tell people what happens in Spain is different from France etc. ""Most countries don't ask for a PCR test to come back in, they recommend it but will accept an antigen test which is a lot cheaper. ""In France you're going to have a digital pass which we don't have. Once again it feels like the Scottish traveller is being blindsided.

"This video can not be played 'Teach children dangers of the Scottish waters' The family of a ""one in a million"" teenager who drowned in Loch Lomond have pleaded for lessons be be learned from his death. Connor Markward, 16, lost his life at the beauty spot near Balloch Country Park three weeks ago. He had been enjoying a day out with friends - oblivious to the dangers of the water he was swimming in. Now his grieving loved ones are calling for a safety campaign in schools to prevent a future tragedy. Connor's sister Claire Lindsay, 35, said: ""I never knew how dangerous Loch Lomond was. You don't understand until it happens to you. ""We are so heartbroken. He had a heart of gold."" Connor's sister Claire has been left heartbroken by the loss of her brother Connor's death was one of seven drownings in the space of a week last month in Scotland. An 11-year-old boy diedon 24 July after getting into difficulty in a river near Stonehouse, South Lanarkshire. On the same day, the body of a 13-year-old boy was recovered from the River Clyde near Lanark. An hour latera woman, her son and a family friend all diednear Pulpit Rock at Ardlui on Loch Lomond. And a 34-year-old man died a few daysafter being pulled from Loch Lubnaig. Connor's was one of a series of water-related deaths over a single weekend last month It was a tragic series of events over a weekend which Connor Markward's sister Claire will never get over. She said: ""The morning of the incident, he was away to enjoy himself. He only gave me half a cuddle that time because he was in such a rush. ""I told him to be careful and he said he would call me later. I can't believe he walked out this door and never came back."" Connor Markward was on a day out with friends when he died Claire told BBC Scotland that Connor could swim but was not confident in the water. She admitted she had no idea about safety advice for people who get into trouble in the water - including leaning back and extending your arms and legs. She said: ""I never knew how dangerous Loch Lomond was. I think they should teach about currents and how deep the water is in nurseries and schools. ""I didn't even know until after Connor passed that when you get into difficulty you are not supposed to panic and you should 'starfish' in the water. If you get taught thatâ¦ it could save people's lives."" Weekend of water deaths 'is worst in memory' Don't take a chance in open water, swimmers urged Connor's mother Margaret Lindsay described how her 16-year-old son, from Easterhouse in Glasgow, was planning an exciting new phase of his life when tragedy struck. She said: ""It hits me every morning. He gave me a kiss on the cheek and a cuddle every day. I am missing his smile. ""The morning before he left for Loch Lomond, he was talking about college and setting up his first bank account. He couldn't wait to get his provisional licence and to drive."" Margaret, 52, believes easier access to swimming lessons for youngsters in school may help prevent another family from suffering like hers. She continued: ""I had never heard you were supposed to do 'the star' to keep floating. I want more talks about swimming, learning to swim and awareness about the dangers."" This video can not be played Ross MacLeod, RNLI : ""Rest and relax in the water"" The RNLI say there are five steps to know how to float: If you fall in the water, fight your instinct to thrash around Lean back, extend your arms and legs If you need to, gently move them around to help you float Float until you can control your breathing Only then, call for help or swim to safety. Find out more about theRNLI's ""float to live"" campaign,external The Scottish government said its sympathies were with Connor Markward's family and confirmed a meeting had been held with emergency services and other organisations to identify ways of reducing future fatalities. Community Safety Minister Ash Denham said: ""Beautiful and enticing as they often appear, Scotland's waters can be a source of lethal danger as we saw with the heartbreaking loss of lives this summer. ""I was heartened to hear a real determination and unity of purpose at Wednesday's meeting for everyone to work together to improve water safety. ""I am encouraged all participants agreed not only to review their own organisation's approach and performance, but also to work collaboratively so that key, consistent messages get across to the public. ""We have agreed to come together again in a few weeks' time to assess what further effort is required to ensure greater protection for the public in future."" West Dunbartonshire Council, which is responsible for Balloch Country Park, told BBC Scotland it had recently bought 15 items of safety equipment. Officials said 21 locations have been identified on the shore of Loch Lomond within Balloch Country Park for the installation of new lifebelts, throw lines and signs. The local authority said these would be installed ""as soon as possible"". Loch Lomond & The Trossachs National Park Authority confirmed changes following Connor's death. Simon Jones, director of environment and visitor services, said: ""Our deepest sympathies go to the families of Connor and all of the others who died so tragically in water-related incidents over the last few weeks. ""In the immediate term, we have stepped up our water safety advice on the ground and online and encourage everyone to take some time to read about the dangers of the water in the national park and share this with their friends and family.""

"Esther Dingley sent this selfie at the top of a mountain on 22 November The death of a British hiker in the Pyrenees was an accident, French police have said. Esther Dingley's remains were found by her partner Daniel Colegate on Monday more than eight months after she disappeared during a solo trek. A source told the BBC she suffered injuries associated with a fall and though the cause was unclear, her shoes ""were not adequate for icy conditions"". The judge in charge of the inquiry said her body may be repatriated next week. Daniel Colegate walked hundreds of miles in the search for his missing partner Esther Dingley The BBC's Chris Bockman in Toulouse said an autopsy and an examination of her rucksack had been carried out by forensic teams. He said it was ""unclear"" how the accident had happened but police believe the hiking shoes she was wearing several thousand metres up a mountain ""did not have the grip necessary for the icy conditions at the time and she probably slipped and fell"". He also said French officers had confirmed Mr Colegate, who was 100 miles away in France when Ms Dingley, 37, disappeared, was not a suspect. Ms Dingley was an experienced hiker LBT Global, a charity which is supporting Ms Dingley's family, had said her death was probably an accident ""given the location and other early indications"". Ms Dingley, who was an experienced hiker, was trekking alone when shelast communicated with her partnerfrom the top of Pic de Sauvegarde at about 16:00 on 22 November. Mr Colegate raised the alarm several days later when she failed to report in at an agreed time. The couple from Durham wereon an open-ended campervan tour of Europeand Ms Dingley was on the final walk of a month-long solo expedition when she died.

"This video can not be played Dion Dublin says Arsenal lack leadership on the pitch after Brentford loss Brentford celebrated their return to the top tier after a 74-year absence with a memorable, magnificent victory over woeful Arsenal as they opened their Premier League campaign in style. Thomas Frank's side were vibrant, skilful and energetic on a night of high emotion at the Brentford Community Stadium, making the perfect start to the season, but inflicting serious pain on the Gunners in a sobering 90 minutes for the visitors. Brentford took to life in the big time with ease and fully deserved the lead given to them after 22 minutes when Sergi Canos drove low past keeper Bernd Leno at the near post, although Arsenal complained bitterly that the ball had gone out of play in the build-up. Only Emile Smith Rowe truly rose above the mediocrity for Arsenal, forcing a save out of Brentford keeper David Raya - who also brilliantly denied Nicolas Pepe late on - before the home fans exploded in noise and elation when they scored a second with 17 minutes left. Arsenal, without strike pair Alexandre Lacazette and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang through illness, paid the price for a hopeless attempt to defend substitute Mads Bech Sorensen's routine long throw. New Â£50m defender Ben White was particularly culpable as Christian Norgaard arrived to head home. Brentford's supporters, understandably, celebrated wildly at the final whistle, but this was a result and performance that instantly turns the spotlight on Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta as he desperately needs an improvement on last season. Follow reaction to the game This video can not be played Brentford 2-0 Arsenal: Frank praises ""great"" Brentford after first Premier League win Brentford could not have made a better start to life in the Premier League, showing the pedigree that has made them such an entertaining side on their journey to this stage. On a thunderous night at the Brentford Community Stadium, the arena was alive with noise and excitement well before kick-off - and what happened when the action started only raised those levels. Tough days will inevitably lie ahead for the top-flight newcomers, but this was a night when the Bees showed what they were all about under charismatic manager Frank. Once they realised Arsenal had little offer after the early exchanges, Brentford took charge and Bryan Mbeumo had already struck the post before Canos opened the scoring. They grew in confidence, winning the physical challenges, attacking swiftly and, on the rare occasions he was called upon, keeper Raya looked a class act. Frank and his players rightly savoured the moment at the final whistle - in front of supporters who did themselves huge credit with thestanding ovation given to Arsenal substitute Bukayo Saka,who was racially abused after missing a penalty in England's Euro 2020 final loss to Italy. This was quite simply how Brentford would have scripted it. No-one can begrudge them their victory - and the manner in which they revelled in it. This video can not be played Brentford 2-0 Arsenal: Mikel Arteta 'extremely disappointed' after Brentford defeat Arsenal were handed a difficult opening assignment as there is always an element of jeopardy attached to a visit to a newly-promoted side. This, however, was light years from what will be required this season and manager Arteta has work to do to knock the Gunners into shape on this evidence. Yes, he was missing strikers Lacazette and Aubameyang, while Saka only started on the bench, but the lack of resolve, the lack of a coherent plan and lack of threat when they needed to fight their way back into contention was alarming. Only Smith Rowe looked capable of providing a spark while it was a harrowing start to life at Arsenal for expensive summer acquisition White. He was tormented throughout and part of a desperate attempt to defend the throw-in that led to Brentford's second goal. Arsenal are familiar with the criticisms that will be aimed at them, namely a failure to match the fight and physical assets of opponents, but here they can have no answer to the charges. They were weak in all areas, especially in defence, with Pablo Mari and Calum Chambers also on the rack throughout. Keeper Leno was at fault for the first goal, put his defence under pressure playing out from the back and almost gifted Brentford a third, providing evidence why Arteta is in the market for a new number one. This was a thoroughly wretched night in every respect for Arteta and his players. They will hope it is a one-off, but the club's detractors will say they have seen too many nightmares like this.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson says Britain's involvement in Afghanistan was ""right, it was worth it"" Boris Johnson has said the UK can be ""extremely proud"" of its role in Afghanistan, despite the situation in the country having ""deteriorated"". The UK will evacuate the ""vast bulk"" of its embassy staff in the coming days asthe Taliban continues to advance. The prime minister said there was ""no military solution"" after an emergency Cobra meeting on Friday afternoon. On Thursday, the UK said it wouldsend 600 troops to help evacuate British nationals and former Afghan staff. Thousands of civilians have fled the Taliban onslaught, heading for the capital of Kabul. The World Food Programme has warned that food shortages are ""dire"", while the UN has urged Afghanistan's neighbours to keep their borders open. The militants now control about a third of Afghanistan's provincial capitals, including Herat, Ghazni and Lashkar Gar. Who are the Taliban? Taliban back brutal rule as they strike for power Young Afghan women fear for future under Taliban Mr Johnson insisted there was no military solution following the gains made by the Taliban in recent days and said that a team of Home Office officials would be sent to step up efforts to relocate Afghans who worked for British forces in the country. ""It is very difficult obviously, but I think the UK can be extremely proud of what has been done in Afghanistan over the last 20 years,"" he said. The prime minister said that thanks to the efforts of the UK armed services there had been no al-Qaeda attacks on the West for ""a very long time"". He also added that three million girls and young women in Afghanistan had been educated who otherwise would not have been, during the last 20 years. ""I think we've got to be realistic about the abilities of the UK or any power to impose a military solution, a combat solution in Afghanistan,"" Mr Johnson said. ""What we certainly can do is work with all our partners in the region and around the world who share an interest with us in preventing Afghanistan from once again becoming a breeding ground for terror."" This video can not be played Lisa Nandy says Afghanistan was a âhumanitarian crisis unfolding in front of our eyesâ Earlier, Lisa Nandy, Labour's shadow foreign secretary, told BBC Radio 4's World At One programme there was ""far more"" the UK could do to support the people of Afghanistan and accused the government of ""hiding"". She warned the government that cross-party MPs could push to recall Parliament to hold the government to account if it did not show a clear strategy. Ms Nandy said that people in the country felt ""abandoned"" and were looking to the US and UK for ""a level of leadership"". This video can not be played The BBC's  Secunder Kermani reports on life in a town recently taken by the Taliban Her concerns were echoed by former Conservative Defence Minister Johnny Mercer, who served in Afghanistan. He described the situation in the country as a ""world tragedy"" which would have repercussions ""for years to come"". Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey has also backed the idea of recalling Parliament ""given the tragedy unfolding before our eyes"" and called on the UN to deploy peacekeepers. Earlier, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace acknowledged thatthe country could be ""heading towards civil war"". He blamed former US President Donald Trump's ""rotten deal"" with the Taliban in 2020 for the withdrawal. The UK governmenthas launched ""Operation Pitting"",,externalto help evacuate British nationals, former UK staff and others who are eligible to relocate to the UK. Mr Wallace said around 600 troops were being sent to Afghanistan to ensure the safe return of about 500 Foreign Office and other UK government officials, along with around 3,000 British citizens working in other roles, such as security guards for aid agencies. About 2,000 Afghan interpreters and ""other people we have an obligation to"" would also be transported to the UK, he said, joining some 3,000 who had already been taken out of the country. RAF aircraft could be used if needed and the Home Office would also be deploying a small team of officials to assist with processing new visas, the Ministry of Defence said. This video can not be played Defence Secretary Ben Wallace: ""I think we are heading towards a civil war"" The US said it would have the bulk of the 3,000 troops it is sending to assist with evacuation in place by the end of the weekend. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby added that the US military was ""certainly concerned about the speed with which the Taliban is moving"". Nato said it had discussed the situation on Friday and would aim to support the Afghan government and security forces ""as much as possible"". Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the Taliban would not be recognised by the international community if it took the country by force, adding that there was deep concern about reports of serious human rights abuses. People fleeing the Taliban are flooding into the capital of Kabul Wendy Rayner, whose husband Peter died in action in Helmand province in 2010, said the withdrawal undermined the sacrifice of soldiers who had lost their lives. ""My husband died to give them a better life, and by them not having a better life, it's taken away his fight,"" she told the BBC. ""All these young people in Afghanistan that are having their families slaughtered because nobody cares, because we've just left them in the lurch - it's just going to create another terror threat. They're going to hate us and I don't blame them."" Mr Johnson said he did not think the sacrifices made by British forces were ""in vain"". ""I believe it was right, it was worth it and what we must do now is not turn our backs on Afghanistan,"" he said. INSOMNIA AND ME:Why are thousands of young people struggling with sleep disorders?

"This year's results showed a sharp increase from 2019, but fewer pupils from poorer backgrounds achieved A*-C grades There is a widening gap for top GCSE results between pupils from poorer backgrounds and others, figures show. This year's top results showed asharp increase from pre-Covid levelsin 2019. However, 52% of pupils who were eligible for free school meals got grades between A* and C. For those who were not eligible, it rose to 79.3%. David Evans, Wales secretary of National Education Union (NEU) Cymru, said it showed the pandemic hit people from poorer backgrounds harder. The gap of those getting the best grades has grown to 27.3% after narrowing slightly to 24.2% in 2020. Record GCSE results after second year of no exams Olympic twins celebrate grades success 'All pupils should receive free school meals' Mr Evans said: ""Poverty has been an issue here. The pandemic hasn't hit people fairly. ""There will be children who haven't had the space to learn at home and who haven't had the resources to learn at home and will have to share resources and be in cramped spaces and that is a genuine unfairness we can't do anything about at this stage. ""It's not going to be a quick fix. We need to work with all the organisations to see what can be done to repair that situation, to make sure in the future learners are on a fairer level playing field. ""This has definitely been a factor in widening the gap and the task now will be for Welsh government to see what can be done."" Statistics from this year's GCSE results revealed pupils on free school meals were 11.5 percentage points behind those not eligible when it came to getting A* grades. This has grown by 2.8 percentage points since last year and has widened by 6.2 percentage points since 2019. How does the GCSE grading system work? The Welsh government launched itsrenew and reform plan,externalfor education in June, with a commitment of more than Â£150m for 2021-22. Education Minister Jeremy Miles said: ""Over the next year, the renew and reform plan I announced a few weeks ago will provide specific funding to support disadvantaged pupils over the coming years because we recognise the impact of Covid hasn't hit people equally as a government we recognise that and need to give additional support to those students who need it most."" Results look similar across the UK, showing higher grades achieved compared to pre-Covid levels. Last year, schools across the UK had to adapt to learning from home and exams were cancelled for many. Wales uses alphabetic A to G grading system, English exam boards use 1-9 (9 is equivalent to A*) and pupils in Northern Ireland get a combination of both. Overall in the UK: Girls moved further ahead of boys - 33.4% of girls' results were 7/A, compared to 24.4% for boys Northern Ireland had the highest grades In England, independent schools had biggest increase in top grades - 61.2% at 7/A, compared to 26.1% in comprehensives and 28.1% in academies Pupils eligible for free school meals slipped slightly further behind London had most top grades in England, with the north-east the fewest 3,606 pupils got all grade 9s COMEDY 'THE LEARNERS':Third times a charm, right?

"US troops reportedly begin to arrive in Kabul to help with the evacuation of diplomats, as the Taliban move closer to the city Several European nations are also evacuating non-essential embassy staff or temporarily closing their embassies The militants continue their rapid offensive, seizing more territory and capturing key cities Kandahar, the country's second largest city and a key trading hub, has fallen to the insurgents The group now controls most of northern Afghanistan and more than a third of its regional capitals. Tens of thousands of civilians have fled the Taliban advance. About 1,000 have been killed in the past month, the UN says Many of the internally displaced have travelled to Kabul and are sleeping in makeshift camps or on the streets It comes as US and other foreign troops withdraw after 20 years of military operations Edited by Flora Drury Weâre now pausing our coverage for today but will be keeping our
main story updated. Here are
some of the key points from today:  The writers on the live page today have been Sophie Williams, Victoria Bisset, Josh Cheetham, Jack Hunter, Kelly-Leigh Cooper and Max Matza. The page was edited by Flora Drury and Alix Kroeger. Some expatriate Afghans have been sharing their frustrations with trying to help loved ones stranded in Kabul. One
German resident who contacted the BBC said his relatives had requested special
immigrant visas for the US, which he says they are eligible for. However, they
are still waiting. âThey
are in a very bad situation, but the thing is, all the embassies are closed
because of corona. I donât know what will happen with my family. Thatâs why I
want to share my pain and my sadness with people and say just help Afghanistan,â
he said. They
have considered going through a third country such as Tajikistan. But again, the
embassies are closed. âI
speak to my family every day. Many days Iâm in my German class but my mind, my
focus, everything is in Afghanistan. Iâm thinking about my family. âI donât
know what will happen. My family are afraid. Just last night I talked with my
sister and she was crying. I told her be safe, take care, donât go outside.â He
appealed for the US and UK to remain for some time. âBecause
of their colleagues, because of those people who work for peace, construction,
childrenâs rights and womenâs rights."" Mr Guterres said it was heartbreaking that hard-won rights were being ripped away from Afghan women As we mentioned earlier, UN Secretary-General Antonio
Guterres, warned that Afghanistan is spinning out of control. He also said he was âdeeply disturbed by early indications
that the Taliban are imposing severe restrictions on human rights in the areas
under their control, particularly targeting women and journalistsâ. âIt is particularly horrifying and heart-breaking to see
reports of the hard-won rights of Afghan girls and women being ripped away from
them,â he said. Under the previous period of Taliban rule in 1996-2001, women had to cover their faces and be
accompanied by a male family member when leaving the house. By Bahman Kalbasi, BBC Persian As news of Taliban forcesâ rapid takeover of
major cities raised concerns about the deteriorating
situation in Afghanistan, BBC Persian spoke to a US-based women's rights and peace activist. When asked about her take on the developments
in her homeland, Malalai Habibi became visibly upset and listed prominent Afghan women who had long and repeatedly warned of a Taliban takeover and what it would mean for millions of women and children. âAll of this was predicted: Taliban murdering civilians, slaughtering
women, forced marriages for women, all of it. What's there left to say that we
havenât warned about already?â Malalai asked. But sadly, she said, no-one had heard
their voices: âNot the media, not the politicians and not the international
community, and now the people of Afghanistan are falling victims to the dirty, domestic and international politics.â Malalai was no longer in the mood to talk. Given that

Some 600 personnel are involved in Operation Pitting As US troops arrive in Kabul, the UK government has also announced the beginning of its operation to evacuate British nationals and others eligible to relocate to the UK. Six hundred troops have begun deploying to support the evacuations as part of Operation Pitting, while officials will also be sent to help speed up processing visas and other documents from Afghanistan,according to a government statement,external. RAF aircraft could be used if needed. More than 2,000 local members of staff who worked with the UK in Afghanistan have been relocated to the UK along with their families since April this year, the government says. The UK has urged all British nationals to leave the country immediately in response to the deteriorating security situation, providing emergency travel documents and loans where appropriate. Danish Foreign Minister Jeppe Kofod has announced that Denmark will be closing its embassy in the Afghan capital for now, as the security situation deteriorates. All employees at the embassy are being evacuated, he added, calling on all Danes to leave the country immediately. Just yesterday, Denmark announced that it would be suspending deportations of rejected Afghan asylum seekers to Afghanistan until 8 October - joining a growing list of European countries doing the same. The decision was an about turn. Last week, Denmark and five other EU nations signed a letter to the European Commission, insisting on their right to forcibly deport Afghan asylum seekers whose cases had been rejected. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby says that the US is ""able to move thousands"" of evacuees out of the country each day. The estimate came after he was asked about the plan to rescue interpreters and other Afghans who have worked with the US government. ""But that's just the air lift capacity. That doesn't necessarily mean that you're going to end up with that everyday,"" he said from the Pentagon in Virginia. ""It's going to depend on the processing in, and how that goes,"" he added. ""So what we want to be able to do is get there fast... and be able to provide as much capacity to the State Department as we can and our intention is to be able to move thousands per day."" Our correspondent has been sharing some thoughts Ghani hosts an event at the presidential palace in Kabul earlier this month President Ashraf Ghani has ruled out the idea of resigning, multiple sources have told the BBCâs Secunder Kermani in Afghanistan. Secunder reports that the Taliban strategy now appears to be one of isolating Afghanistanâs central leadership in Kabul, and either making a military push into the city or waiting for international pressure on Ghani to step down. Meanwhile, a key Taliban opponent who surrendered this week has been rallying other warlords to capitulate. âThis is what Taliban mean by power sharing,â Secunder says about the deals being made between the Taliban and independent warlords, rather than with the internationally-backed central government. âSince the Moscow conference in 2019 I got the sense theyâre happy to make deals with power brokers like Ismail Khan,â says Secunder, referring to the captured anti-Taliban figure. âThat means they wonât face constant war, and they can say itâs not monopoly rule. âNo room for Ghani in their vision, though.â As we reported earlier, former US President Donald Trump has issued a statement on the ""tragic mess in Afghanistan"", taking it as as an opportunity to ask Americans ""do you miss me yet?"". His spokeswoman added on Twitter: ""Trump bombed Taliban to negotiating table; Biden let them waltz to Kandahar."" But earlier today,UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallacelaid the blame for the present situation squarely at Mr Trump's door. Speaking to BBC Breakfast, he described former Mr Trump's previous agreement with the Taliban as a ""rotten deal"" that potentially undermined the Afghan government. ""We as international partners found it uncomfortable because we had deployed through a US framework... so when they pulled that framework, we had to leave."" These images from today show how the country has been affected by the Taliban advance. The militants are continuing their rapid offensive, seizing more territory and capturing key cities. Thousands of people have been forced to flee their homes. The US and UK have sent troops to the capital Kabul in order to evacuate nationals. Taliban militants gather after taking control of Lashkar Gah People stranded at the Pakistan- Afghani border wait to cross UK troops board a flight as they are deployed to Afghanistan A senior US State Department official has deleted a tweet expressing sympathy for the women of Afghanistan. ""Woke up with a heavy heart, thinking about all the Afghan women and girls I worked with during my time in Kabul,"" wrote Deputy Assistant Secretary for European and Eurasian Affairs Molly Montgomery. ""They were the beneficiaries of many of the gains we made, and now they stand to lose everything,"" she added. âWe empowered them to lead, and now we are powerless to protect them.â A spokesperson later told Fox News that she ""deleted the tweet on her own volition"". This video can not be played âNot an Afghanistan problem but a humanity problemâ - Gen McMaster It is unfair to say Afghans need to fight against Taliban militants by themselves, the former US national security adviser Gen HR McMaster has said. The militants are ""the enemies of all civilisation, of all humanity"", he told the BBC's Yalda Hakim on Thursday. ""Afghanistan is spinning out of control,"" United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned on Friday, calling for an immediate halt to the Taliban offensive. ""The message from the international community to those on the warpath must be clear: seizing power through military force is a losing proposition,"" he told reporters. ""That can only lead to prolonged civil war or to the complete isolation of Afghanistan."" Taliban militants at the governor's house in Ghazni city on Thursday US Pentagon spokesman John Kirby says the US military is ""certainly concerned about the speed with which the Taliban is moving"". Asked if the US is concerned that the Afghans will not mount a strong defence of Kabul, Kirby hits back: ""That's a question for Afghan leadership to determine for themselves."" ""This is a moment for the Afghans to unite â the leadership and the military,"" he added. Kirby refused to discuss the rules of engagement for US soldiers who have just arrived in Afghanistan to help embassy staff in Kabul. ""Kabul is not, right now, in an imminent threat environment,"" he continued, adding that the Taliban is moving to isolate the city. Back when the Taliban ruled Afghanistan, women faced many restrictions on their daily lives: girls were banned from schools, while women were only allowed to leave their homes if they covered their faces and were accompanied by a close male relative. The movement insists it's changed in the 20 years since it was forced from power, but some women have told a very different story since the militants began their rapid advance across the county. Noor Khatera, 43, was one of nine women ordered to leave their office at the Azizi Bank in the southern city of Kandahar in July, according to Reuters news agency. Just two days later, a similar scene unfolded at a bank in the city of Herat in the west of the country. ""It's really strange to not be allowed to get to work, but now this is what it is,"" Noor told Reuters. ""I taught myself English and even learned how to operate a computer, but now I will have to look for a place where I can just work with more women around."" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby is now taking questions at a Pentagon briefing. He says that the US will continue to conduct airstrikes on behalf of the Afghan government, but says they are not a ""panacea"" for all security issues facing the country. ""We never argued that our airstrikes from the air were going to turn the tide on the ground,"" said Kirby. ""What we have said is the Afghans on the ground have the capacity to do that. ""They have the capability. They have the air force. They have the weaponry. It's indigenous forces that can make the difference on the ground.""

""We thought there was a back-up plan from the [the US and its coalition allies] to save the Afghan government and save Afghan families.â Speaking from the state of North Carolina, where he now lives, he continues: âI think children will not get to be children. Females will be taken from their homes and married to Taliban fighters.â âOur families are in danger right now. We donât know what to do, where to go, or whoâs going to take action. We could lose everybody.â Mr Ghafoori, 37, added that he is concerned for the fate of thousands of Afghan interpreters who remain in the country. âEveryone is worried about their families. Their parents. I fear theyâre going to get tortured,â Mr Ghafoori said. âSomeone must think about those families that are over there.â Read more:From Afghan interpreter to US homeless The Spanish government has said it is working to resettle translators who helped its forces in Afghanistan, news agency AFP reports.

"US troops reportedly begin to arrive in Kabul to help with the evacuation of diplomats, as the Taliban move closer to the city Several European nations are also evacuating non-essential embassy staff or temporarily closing their embassies The militants continue their rapid offensive, seizing more territory and capturing key cities Kandahar, the country's second largest city and a key trading hub, has fallen to the insurgents The group now controls most of northern Afghanistan and more than a third of its regional capitals. Tens of thousands of civilians have fled the Taliban advance. About 1,000 have been killed in the past month, the UN says Many of the internally displaced have travelled to Kabul and are sleeping in makeshift camps or on the streets It comes as US and other foreign troops withdraw after 20 years of military operations Edited by Flora Drury Weâre now pausing our coverage for today but will be keeping our
main story updated. Here are
some of the key points from today:  The writers on the live page today have been Sophie Williams, Victoria Bisset, Josh Cheetham, Jack Hunter, Kelly-Leigh Cooper and Max Matza. The page was edited by Flora Drury and Alix Kroeger. Some expatriate Afghans have been sharing their frustrations with trying to help loved ones stranded in Kabul. One
German resident who contacted the BBC said his relatives had requested special
immigrant visas for the US, which he says they are eligible for. However, they
are still waiting. âThey
are in a very bad situation, but the thing is, all the embassies are closed
because of corona. I donât know what will happen with my family. Thatâs why I
want to share my pain and my sadness with people and say just help Afghanistan,â
he said. They
have considered going through a third country such as Tajikistan. But again, the
embassies are closed. âI
speak to my family every day. Many days Iâm in my German class but my mind, my
focus, everything is in Afghanistan. Iâm thinking about my family. âI donât
know what will happen. My family are afraid. Just last night I talked with my
sister and she was crying. I told her be safe, take care, donât go outside.â He
appealed for the US and UK to remain for some time. âBecause
of their colleagues, because of those people who work for peace, construction,
childrenâs rights and womenâs rights."" Mr Guterres said it was heartbreaking that hard-won rights were being ripped away from Afghan women As we mentioned earlier, UN Secretary-General Antonio
Guterres, warned that Afghanistan is spinning out of control. He also said he was âdeeply disturbed by early indications
that the Taliban are imposing severe restrictions on human rights in the areas
under their control, particularly targeting women and journalistsâ. âIt is particularly horrifying and heart-breaking to see
reports of the hard-won rights of Afghan girls and women being ripped away from
them,â he said. Under the previous period of Taliban rule in 1996-2001, women had to cover their faces and be
accompanied by a male family member when leaving the house. By Bahman Kalbasi, BBC Persian As news of Taliban forcesâ rapid takeover of
major cities raised concerns about the deteriorating
situation in Afghanistan, BBC Persian spoke to a US-based women's rights and peace activist. When asked about her take on the developments
in her homeland, Malalai Habibi became visibly upset and listed prominent Afghan women who had long and repeatedly warned of a Taliban takeover and what it would mean for millions of women and children. âAll of this was predicted: Taliban murdering civilians, slaughtering
women, forced marriages for women, all of it. What's there left to say that we
havenât warned about already?â Malalai asked. But sadly, she said, no-one had heard
their voices: âNot the media, not the politicians and not the international
community, and now the people of Afghanistan are falling victims to the dirty, domestic and international politics.â Malalai was no longer in the mood to talk. Given that
the voices of Afghan women are now ignored, she said she hoped her silence would instead gain attention. She then taped over her mouth. Allow Twitter content?

"Daniela Espirito Santo reported her boyfriend seven times in less than a year before her death in 2020 No standards were breached by police when a woman died while on hold reporting a domestic assault, a watchdog has said. Daniela Espirito Santo, 23, from Grantham, reported partner Julio Jesus for attacking her while on bail for another assault the same day. He was charged with manslaughter but that was dropped over lack of evidence linking the attack and her death. He was instead charged with assault and jailed for 10 months. A report by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), whichwas leaked to the New York Times,external, detailed seven calls from Ms Espirito Santo about her partner between May 2019 and April 2020. During her final 999 call on 8 April 2020, she reported being attacked hours after Jesus was released on police bail for an assault earlier that day in which he pinned her down and pushed his arm against her throat. The 999 call handler deemed the call non-urgent as Jesus had left the home and told Ms Espirito Santo to ring back on the non-emergency 101 number. Eight minutes later, when the non-emergency call handler answered, all she could hear were the distraught cries of a baby. When police forced entry to Ms Espirito Santo's flat, they found her slumped on the sofa cradling her six-month-old son. Daniela Espirito Santo died while on hold to report a second attack by her partner in one day Following her death, Julio Jesus was arrested on suspicion of manslaughter. A post-mortem examination found Ms Espirito Santo had died from a pre-existing heart condition and that there was a possible link between the stress of the assault and her heart failing. However, after further reviewing medical evidence, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said it did not believe it could sufficiently prove ""an evidential link"" between the assault and her death and dropped the manslaughter charge. A spokeswoman for the CPS said: ""Julio Jesus was originally charged with the manslaughter of Daniela Espirito Santo on the basis that his actions that day triggered a fatal complication from a pre-existing heart condition. ""As the case neared trial, and following review of further expert medical reports, it became apparent we could not prove an evidential link between Ms Santo's tragic heart failure and what occurred that day between her and Mr Jesus. ""We contacted Ms Santo's family to explain the way the evidence in this case led to this conclusion. Our thoughts and sympathies are with her loved ones at this difficult time,"" the spokeswoman added. Instead, Jesus was convicted for two assaults and jailed. Charly Price-Wallace, a friend of Ms Espirito Santo's, has called for greater protection for victims of domestic abuse who are scared to press charges against their partners. ""They had record of seven incidents which contained 10 attacks that Dani had disclosed and yet didn't see a pattern or do anything about it. ""We need to make sure her name means something - that she didn't die in vain."" Charly Price-Wallace says she wants more to be done to protect vulnerable domestic abuse victims scared to press charges Copies of police reports in the IOPC investigation show how the abuse escalated over the course of a year from threats to kill, to controlling and coercive behaviour and strangulation. The IOPC also found that Lincolnshire Police had not failed in any of their standards during multiple contacts with Ms Espirito Santo. However, the IOPC said there was a ""learning recommendation"" in relation to the need for a force-wide written policy on when to transfer calls directly to the non-emergency 101 service rather than asking people to call back themselves, and any actions to be taken by 999 operators when taking that action. A spokeswoman for Lincolnshire Police said it would not be possible to comment until the conclusion of an inquest into Ms Espirito Santo's death. A Domestic Homicide Review, which is a multi-agency review of the circumstances in which a person's death has, or appears to have, resulted from violence, abuse or neglect by a person to whom they were in an intimate personal relationship, is under way.

"There have been 31 Covid-19 related deaths registered in Northern Ireland in the week to last Friday (6 August), according to the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (Nisra). That is 13 more than the previous week. The agency's total now stands at 3,046. The Department of Health's total for the same date, based on a positive test result being recorded, was 2,217. Nisra figures are higher because it records mentions of the virus on death certificates. This means where the recorded death may or may not have been confirmed by way of a test. On the agency's measure, around two-thirds of Covid-19 related deaths have occurred in hospital (2,031), including the deaths of 239 care home residents. Another 784 people have died in care homes throughout the pandemic. Nisra says around two-thirds of Covid-19 related deaths have occurred in hospital The total of 1,023 means care home residents account for just over a third (33.5%) of all Covid-19 related deaths. Covid-19 related deaths were also recorded in hospices (0.5%) and other residential locations (7.4%). People aged 75 and over account for more than three-quarters of all Covid-19 related registered deaths (75.9%) between 19 March 2020 and 6 August 2021. Armagh City Banbridge and Craigavon (12.1%) and Mid-Ulster (8.2%) local government districts have now recorded higher proportions of all Covid-19 related deaths. That is compared with their share of all deaths in Northern Ireland (10.3% and 6.5% respectively). The provisional number of deaths from all causes registered in the week ending 6August was 342. That is 49 more than the previous week, and 69 more than the 5-year average for the time of year of 273. Medics warn of more cancelled operations What are Northern Ireland's Covid-19 rules now?

"US troops reportedly begin to arrive in Kabul to help with the evacuation of diplomats, as the Taliban move closer to the city Several European nations are also evacuating non-essential embassy staff or temporarily closing their embassies The militants continue their rapid offensive, seizing more territory and capturing key cities Kandahar, the country's second largest city and a key trading hub, has fallen to the insurgents The group now controls most of northern Afghanistan and more than a third of its regional capitals. Tens of thousands of civilians have fled the Taliban advance. About 1,000 have been killed in the past month, the UN says Many of the internally displaced have travelled to Kabul and are sleeping in makeshift camps or on the streets It comes as US and other foreign troops withdraw after 20 years of military operations Edited by Flora Drury Weâre now pausing our coverage for today but will be keeping our
main story updated. Here are
some of the key points from today:  The writers on the live page today have been Sophie Williams, Victoria Bisset, Josh Cheetham, Jack Hunter, Kelly-Leigh Cooper and Max Matza. The page was edited by Flora Drury and Alix Kroeger. Some expatriate Afghans have been sharing their frustrations with trying to help loved ones stranded in Kabul. One
German resident who contacted the BBC said his relatives had requested special
immigrant visas for the US, which he says they are eligible for. However, they
are still waiting. âThey
are in a very bad situation, but the thing is, all the embassies are closed
because of corona. I donât know what will happen with my family. Thatâs why I
want to share my pain and my sadness with people and say just help Afghanistan,â
he said. They
have considered going through a third country such as Tajikistan. But again, the
embassies are closed. âI
speak to my family every day. Many days Iâm in my German class but my mind, my
focus, everything is in Afghanistan. Iâm thinking about my family. âI donât
know what will happen. My family are afraid. Just last night I talked with my
sister and she was crying. I told her be safe, take care, donât go outside.â He
appealed for the US and UK to remain for some time. âBecause
of their colleagues, because of those people who work for peace, construction,
childrenâs rights and womenâs rights."" Mr Guterres said it was heartbreaking that hard-won rights were being ripped away from Afghan women As we mentioned earlier, UN Secretary-General Antonio
Guterres, warned that Afghanistan is spinning out of control. He also said he was âdeeply disturbed by early indications
that the Taliban are imposing severe restrictions on human rights in the areas
under their control, particularly targeting women and journalistsâ. âIt is particularly horrifying and heart-breaking to see
reports of the hard-won rights of Afghan girls and women being ripped away from
them,â he said. Under the previous period of Taliban rule in 1996-2001, women had to cover their faces and be
accompanied by a male family member when leaving the house. By Bahman Kalbasi, BBC Persian As news of Taliban forcesâ rapid takeover of
major cities raised concerns about the deteriorating
situation in Afghanistan, BBC Persian spoke to a US-based women's rights and peace activist. When asked about her take on the developments
in her homeland, Malalai Habibi became visibly upset and listed prominent Afghan women who had long and repeatedly warned of a Taliban takeover and what it would mean for millions of women and children. âAll of this was predicted: Taliban murdering civilians, slaughtering
women, forced marriages for women, all of it. What's there left to say that we
havenât warned about already?â Malalai asked. But sadly, she said, no-one had heard
their voices: âNot the media, not the politicians and not the international
community, and now the people of Afghanistan are falling victims to the dirty, domestic and international politics.â Malalai was no longer in the mood to talk. Given that
the voices of Afghan women are now ignored, she said she hoped her silence would instead gain attention. She then taped over her mouth. Allow Twitter content?

Some 600 personnel are involved in Operation Pitting As US troops arrive in Kabul, the UK government has also announced the beginning of its operation to evacuate British nationals and others eligible to relocate to the UK. Six hundred troops have begun deploying to support the evacuations as part of Operation Pitting, while officials will also be sent to help speed up processing visas and other documents from Afghanistan,according to a government statement,external. RAF aircraft could be used if needed. More than 2,000 local members of staff who worked with the UK in Afghanistan have been relocated to the UK along with their families since April this year, the government says. The UK has urged all British nationals to leave the country immediately in response to the deteriorating security situation, providing emergency travel documents and loans where appropriate. Danish Foreign Minister Jeppe Kofod has announced that Denmark will be closing its embassy in the Afghan capital for now, as the security situation deteriorates. All employees at the embassy are being evacuated, he added, calling on all Danes to leave the country immediately. Just yesterday, Denmark announced that it would be suspending deportations of rejected Afghan asylum seekers to Afghanistan until 8 October - joining a growing list of European countries doing the same. The decision was an about turn. Last week, Denmark and five other EU nations signed a letter to the European Commission, insisting on their right to forcibly deport Afghan asylum seekers whose cases had been rejected. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby says that the US is ""able to move thousands"" of evacuees out of the country each day. The estimate came after he was asked about the plan to rescue interpreters and other Afghans who have worked with the US government. ""But that's just the air lift capacity. That doesn't necessarily mean that you're going to end up with that everyday,"" he said from the Pentagon in Virginia. ""It's going to depend on the processing in, and how that goes,"" he added. ""So what we want to be able to do is get there fast... and be able to provide as much capacity to the State Department as we can and our intention is to be able to move thousands per day."" Our correspondent has been sharing some thoughts Ghani hosts an event at the presidential palace in Kabul earlier this month President Ashraf Ghani has ruled out the idea of resigning, multiple sources have told the BBCâs Secunder Kermani in Afghanistan. Secunder reports that the Taliban strategy now appears to be one of isolating Afghanistanâs central leadership in Kabul, and either making a military push into the city or waiting for international pressure on Ghani to step down. Meanwhile, a key Taliban opponent who surrendered this week has been rallying other warlords to capitulate. âThis is what Taliban mean by power sharing,â Secunder says about the deals being made between the Taliban and independent warlords, rather than with the internationally-backed central government. âSince the Moscow conference in 2019 I got the sense theyâre happy to make deals with power brokers like Ismail Khan,â says Secunder, referring to the captured anti-Taliban figure. âThat means they wonât face constant war, and they can say itâs not monopoly rule. âNo room for Ghani in their vision, though.â As we reported earlier, former US President Donald Trump has issued a statement on the ""tragic mess in Afghanistan"", taking it as as an opportunity to ask Americans ""do you miss me yet?"". His spokeswoman added on Twitter: ""Trump bombed Taliban to negotiating table; Biden let them waltz to Kandahar."" But earlier today,UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallacelaid the blame for the present situation squarely at Mr Trump's door. Speaking to BBC Breakfast, he described former Mr Trump's previous agreement with the Taliban as a ""rotten deal"" that potentially undermined the Afghan government. ""We as international partners found it uncomfortable because we had deployed through a US framework... so when they pulled that framework, we had to leave."" These images from today show how the country has been affected by the Taliban advance. The militants are continuing their rapid offensive, seizing more territory and capturing key cities. Thousands of people have been forced to flee their homes. The US and UK have sent troops to the capital Kabul in order to evacuate nationals. Taliban militants gather after taking control of Lashkar Gah People stranded at the Pakistan- Afghani border wait to cross UK troops board a flight as they are deployed to Afghanistan A senior US State Department official has deleted a tweet expressing sympathy for the women of Afghanistan. ""Woke up with a heavy heart, thinking about all the Afghan women and girls I worked with during my time in Kabul,"" wrote Deputy Assistant Secretary for European and Eurasian Affairs Molly Montgomery. ""They were the beneficiaries of many of the gains we made, and now they stand to lose everything,"" she added. âWe empowered them to lead, and now we are powerless to protect them.â A spokesperson later told Fox News that she ""deleted the tweet on her own volition"". This video can not be played âNot an Afghanistan problem but a humanity problemâ - Gen McMaster It is unfair to say Afghans need to fight against Taliban militants by themselves, the former US national security adviser Gen HR McMaster has said. The militants are ""the enemies of all civilisation, of all humanity"", he told the BBC's Yalda Hakim on Thursday. ""Afghanistan is spinning out of control,"" United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned on Friday, calling for an immediate halt to the Taliban offensive. ""The message from the international community to those on the warpath must be clear: seizing power through military force is a losing proposition,"" he told reporters. ""That can only lead to prolonged civil war or to the complete isolation of Afghanistan."" Taliban militants at the governor's house in Ghazni city on Thursday US Pentagon spokesman John Kirby says the US military is ""certainly concerned about the speed with which the Taliban is moving"". Asked if the US is concerned that the Afghans will not mount a strong defence of Kabul, Kirby hits back: ""That's a question for Afghan leadership to determine for themselves."" ""This is a moment for the Afghans to unite â the leadership and the military,"" he added. Kirby refused to discuss the rules of engagement for US soldiers who have just arrived in Afghanistan to help embassy staff in Kabul. ""Kabul is not, right now, in an imminent threat environment,"" he continued, adding that the Taliban is moving to isolate the city. Back when the Taliban ruled Afghanistan, women faced many restrictions on their daily lives: girls were banned from schools, while women were only allowed to leave their homes if they covered their faces and were accompanied by a close male relative. The movement insists it's changed in the 20 years since it was forced from power, but some women have told a very different story since the militants began their rapid advance across the county. Noor Khatera, 43, was one of nine women ordered to leave their office at the Azizi Bank in the southern city of Kandahar in July, according to Reuters news agency. Just two days later, a similar scene unfolded at a bank in the city of Herat in the west of the country. ""It's really strange to not be allowed to get to work, but now this is what it is,"" Noor told Reuters. ""I taught myself English and even learned how to operate a computer, but now I will have to look for a place where I can just work with more women around."" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby is now taking questions at a Pentagon briefing. He says that the US will continue to conduct airstrikes on behalf of the Afghan government, but says they are not a ""panacea"" for all security issues facing the country. ""We never argued that our airstrikes from the air were going to turn the tide on the ground,"" said Kirby. ""What we have said is the Afghans on the ground have the capacity to do that. ""They have the capability. They have the air force. They have the weaponry. It's indigenous forces that can make the difference on the ground."" Bernd DebusmannBBC Washington Zia Ghafoori says he cannot believe how quickly the country is falling to the Taliban A former Afghan interpreter who worked for the US military tells BBC News that he and other Afghans who have escaped the country are consumed with worry at the worsening security situation. âWe werenât expecting this, for the Taliban to take over so many places so quickly,"" says Zia Ghafoori, who was wounded while attached to a US Special Forces unit in 2008. ""We thought there was a back-up plan from the [the US and its coalition allies] to save the Afghan government and save Afghan families.â Speaking from the state of North Carolina, where he now lives, he continues: âI think children will not get to be children. Females will be taken from their homes and married to Taliban fighters.â âOur families are in danger right now. We donât know what to do, where to go, or whoâs going to take action. We could lose everybody.â Mr Ghafoori, 37, added that he is concerned for the fate of thousands of Afghan interpreters who remain in the country. âEveryone is worried about their families. Their parents. I fear theyâre going to get tortured,â Mr Ghafoori said. âSomeone must think about those families that are over there.â Read more:From Afghan interpreter to US homeless The Spanish government has said it is working to resettle translators who helped its forces in Afghanistan, news agency AFP reports. A timeline for the relocations has not been announced but Madrid plans to process asylum applications by Afghans who worked with Spanish forces once they arrive, an interior ministry source said on Friday. Spain withdrew its final soldiers in May this year. Separately, Switzerland has said it will offer humanitarian visas to around 40 Afghan development agency workers and their families. Last week, the UK foreign secretary announced thatAfghan journalists who worked for the British media would be allowed to relocate to the UKif they are under ""imminent threat"" from the Taliban. Some Afghan interpreters who had put their lives at risk by working with the British military have been permitted to relocate to the UK with their families since 2013. US State Department spokesman Ned Price has just been on television, where he was asked to confirm whether the US and Taliban had brokered a deal to spare the US embassy in Kabul from attack. ""The Taliban have said themselves that they have no intention of targeting diplomatic facilities,"" Price told MSNBC, without addressing the question. ""Of course that is written into international law that they not do so. ""We are not going to trust anything the Taliban says. What we're going to be looking for is what they do. What we can tell through all sources of information that they plan to do. ""That's why we're taking these prudent steps right now to relocate some our civilian personnel. To take them potentially out of harm's way."" Security is seen outside a UN office in Herat (photo taken 31 July) UN security officials say they are evaluating the security situation in Afghanistan on âan hour-by-hour basisâ. Spokesman Stephane Dujarric told Reuters that the approximately 3,000 Afghan staff and 300 international staff in the country had a âvery light footprintâ in the areas conquered by the Taliban. ""The current situation is that we're evaluating, literally on an hour-by-hour basis, the security situation both in Kabul and in other locations,â she said. âThere is no evacuation of UN staff going on,"" she continued, adding that the UN has âcontingency plans for the best case and for the worst caseâ. âAt this point we are remaining in Kabul,â she added.

Asked if the US is concerned that the Afghans will not mount a strong defence of Kabul, Kirby hits back: ""That's a question for Afghan leadership to determine for themselves."" ""This is a moment for the Afghans to unite â the leadership and the military,"" he added. Kirby refused to discuss the rules of engagement for US soldiers who have just arrived in Afghanistan to help embassy staff in Kabul. ""Kabul is not, right now, in an imminent threat environment,"" he continued, adding that the Taliban is moving to isolate the city. Back when the Taliban ruled Afghanistan, women faced many restrictions on their daily lives: girls were banned from schools, while women were only allowed to leave their homes if they covered their faces and were accompanied by a close male relative. The movement insists it's changed in the 20 years since it was forced from power, but some women have told a very different story since the militants began their rapid advance across the county. Noor Khatera, 43, was one of nine women ordered to leave their office at the Azizi Bank in the southern city of Kandahar in July, according to Reuters news agency. Just two days later, a similar scene unfolded at a bank in the city of Herat in the west of the country. ""It's really strange to not be allowed to get to work, but now this is what it is,"" Noor told Reuters. ""I taught myself English and even learned how to operate a computer, but now I will have to look for a place where I can just work with more women around."" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby is now taking questions at a Pentagon briefing. He says that the US will continue to conduct airstrikes on behalf of the Afghan government, but says they are not a ""panacea"" for all security issues facing the country. ""We never argued that our airstrikes from the air were going to turn the tide on the ground,"" said Kirby. ""What we have said is the Afghans on the ground have the capacity to do that. ""They have the capability. They have the air force. They have the weaponry. It's indigenous forces that can make the difference on the ground."" Bernd DebusmannBBC Washington Zia Ghafoori says he cannot believe how quickly the country is falling to the Taliban A former Afghan interpreter who worked for the US military tells BBC News that he and other Afghans who have escaped the country are consumed with worry at the worsening security situation. âWe werenât expecting this, for the Taliban to take over so many places so quickly,"" says Zia Ghafoori, who was wounded while attached to a US Special Forces unit in 2008. ""We thought there was a back-up plan from the [the US and its coalition allies] to save the Afghan government and save Afghan families.â Speaking from the state of North Carolina, where he now lives, he continues: âI think children will not get to be children. Females will be taken from their homes and married to Taliban fighters.â âOur families are in danger right now. We donât know what to do, where to go, or whoâs going to take action. We could lose everybody.â Mr Ghafoori, 37, added that he is concerned for the fate of thousands of Afghan interpreters who remain in the country. âEveryone is worried about their families. Their parents. I fear theyâre going to get tortured,â Mr Ghafoori said. âSomeone must think about those families that are over there.â Read more:From Afghan interpreter to US homeless The Spanish government has said it is working to resettle translators who helped its forces in Afghanistan, news agency AFP reports. A timeline for the relocations has not been announced but Madrid plans to process asylum applications by Afghans who worked with Spanish forces once they arrive, an interior ministry source said on Friday. Spain withdrew its final soldiers in May this year. Separately, Switzerland has said it will offer humanitarian visas to around 40 Afghan development agency workers and their families. Last week, the UK foreign secretary announced thatAfghan journalists who worked for the British media would be allowed to relocate to the UKif they are under ""imminent threat"" from the Taliban. Some Afghan interpreters who had put their lives at risk by working with the British military have been permitted to relocate to the UK with their families since 2013. US State Department spokesman Ned Price has just been on television, where he was asked to confirm whether the US and Taliban had brokered a deal to spare the US embassy in Kabul from attack. ""The Taliban have said themselves that they have no intention of targeting diplomatic facilities,"" Price told MSNBC, without addressing the question. ""Of course that is written into international law that they not do so. ""We are not going to trust anything the Taliban says. What we're going to be looking for is what they do. What we can tell through all sources of information that they plan to do. ""That's why we're taking these prudent steps right now to relocate some our civilian personnel. To take them potentially out of harm's way."" Security is seen outside a UN office in Herat (photo taken 31 July) UN security officials say they are evaluating the security situation in Afghanistan on âan hour-by-hour basisâ. Spokesman Stephane Dujarric told Reuters that the approximately 3,000 Afghan staff and 300 international staff in the country had a âvery light footprintâ in the areas conquered by the Taliban. ""The current situation is that we're evaluating, literally on an hour-by-hour basis, the security situation both in Kabul and in other locations,â she said. âThere is no evacuation of UN staff going on,"" she continued, adding that the UN has âcontingency plans for the best case and for the worst caseâ. âAt this point we are remaining in Kabul,â she added.

"There's been renewed focus on firearm laws in the UK after five people were killed by a registered gun owner. Police say that Jake Davison,who shot himself after the attack in Plymouth, was a licensed firearms holder. There are two main categories - firearms and shotguns. A firearm is defined in the Firearms Act 1968 as any weapon ""from which a shot, bullet or other missile... can be discharged"". A shotgun is a type of gun intended to fire a large number of small pellets rather than a single lead bullet or slug. It is more difficult to get a licence for firearms than for shotguns, because weapons that fire bullets must only be used for specific purposes in specific places. These would include deer stalking or sports shooting on an approved range. In contrast, shotguns tend to be used in more general rural circumstances, such as by farmers who are protecting livestock from foxes - and police recognise that landowners need guns for pest control. According to themost recent figures for England and Wales,external, there are 156,033 people certificated to hold firearms and they own 617,171 weapons. There are shotgun certificates which cover 1.4 million shotguns. Statistics for Scotland show that 70,839 firearms were held by 25,983 certificate holders in 2020. 46,703 people in Scotland are certificated to hold shotguns - and 133,037 weapons are covered by that scheme. Gun laws in the UK are among the toughest in the world. The police are in charge of issuing shotgun and firearm certificates in England, Scotland and Wales. Local forces administer the system rather than a central body, because they will have local information that will inform their judgement. A decision on whether someone gets a licence is the responsibility of the chief officer in that area. Getting a licence is a long and complicated business. It starts with an application form which asks specific questions about why the individual wants a gun, telling them they need to show ""good reason"". This might be that they need it for their profession or sport. A simple wish to own a particular type of firearm is not in itself enough. They must also prove that they are allowed to have a firearms certificate and pose no danger to public safety or to the peace. Independent referees have to provide confidential character statements in which they are expected to answer in detail about the applicant's mental state, home life and attitude towards guns. Officers check the Police National Computer for a criminal record - anyone who has served a prison sentence of more than three years is banned for life from holding a firearms licence. GPs can be contacted if someone has listed a relevant medical condition, including neurological conditions or mental health disorders. Otherwise, GPs are contacted after certification, when they can raise concerns. A note is added to the medical records of a firearm certificate holder. Finally, senior officers must be sure that prospective shotgun holders have a secure location for the weapon, typically a dedicated gun cabinet. Each certificate is valid for five years. Shooting at the 2012 London Paralympics: firearm licences can be granted for sporting reasons Chief police officers have the right to revoke a licence or not to renew it. Police chiefs can revoke certificates if they conclude that the holder can no longer be trusted: In 2020/21, 306 firearm certificates were revoked in England and Wales In 2019/20, 49 firearms certificates were revoked in Scotland Failure to use the firearm or failure to acquire one by the end of the certificate's life could also lead to a licence not being renewed. The two most important laws on gun control in the UK came in the wake of two national tragedies. Michael Ryan's massacre of 16 people in Hungerford in 1987 led to the banning of all modern semi-automatic rifles, the type of guns that can be fired rapidly without needing to be reloaded. Nine years later, Thomas Hamilton killed 16 schoolchildren and their teacher when he opened fire at a school in Dunblane. Parliament banned all handguns and there is now a mandatory five-year jail sentence for possession. TheSmall Arms Survey,externalestimated there were 978,000 unregistered firearms in England, Scotland and Wales in 2018, and 53,000 in Northern Ireland. Mass shootings are extremely rare in the UK. Before this year, there had been four in modern times - the last one was in Cumbria in 2010,when a gunman killed 12 people. Meanwhile, in 2019 alone, there were 417 shootings in the US whereat least four people were shot,external. People in Northern Ireland can hold firearms certificates for activities including sporting and pest control. In 2020, there were 55,441 firearm certificate holders. Unlike in the rest of the UK, handguns are not banned in Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK where you can own a gun for self-defence. People can apply for a ""personal protection weapon"" certificate. These are granted if a person is seen to be at ""real and immediate risk"" and a gun is seen as ""reasonable, proportionate and necessary to protect the life of the applicant"".

"Apple says its announcement of automated tools to detect child sexual abuse on the iPhone and iPad was ""jumbled pretty badly"". On 5 August, the company revealed new image detection software that can alert Apple if known illegal images are uploaded to its iCloud storage. Privacy groups criticised the news, with some saying Apple had created a security backdoor in its software. The company says its announcement had been widely ""misunderstood"". ""We wish that this had come out a little more clearly for everyone,"" said Apple software chief Craig Federighi,in an interview with the Wall Street Journal,external. He said that - in hindsight - introducing two features at the same time was ""a recipe for this kind of confusion"". Apple announced two new tools designed to protect children. They will be deployed in the US first. Image detection The first tool can identify known child sex abuse material (CSAM) when a user uploads photos to iCloud storage. The US National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) maintains a database of known illegal child abuse images. It stores them as hashes - a digital ""fingerprint"" of the illegal material. Cloud service providers such as Facebook, Google and Microsoft, already check images against these hashes to make sure people are not sharing CSAM. Apple's software chief Craig Federighi said messages had been ""jumbled"" Apple decided to implement a similar process, but said it would do the image-matching on a user's iPhone or iPad, before it was uploaded to iCloud. Mr Federighi said the iPhone would not be checking for things such as photos of your children in the bath, or looking for pornography. The system could only match ""exact fingerprints"" of specific known child sexual abuse images, he said. If a user tries to upload several images that match child abuse fingerprints, their account will be flagged to Apple so the specific images can be reviewed. Mr Federighi said a user would have to upload in the region of 30 matching images before this feature would be triggered. Message filtering In addition to the iCloud tool, Apple also announced a parental control that users could activate on their children's accounts. If activated, the system would check photographs sent by - or to - the child over Apple's iMessage app. If the machine learning system judged that a photo contained nudity, it would obscure the photo and warn the child. Parents can also choose to receive an alert if the child chooses to view the photo. Privacy groups have shared concerns that the technology could be expanded and used by authoritarian governments to spy on its own citizens. WhatsApp head Will Cathcart called Apple's move ""very concerning"" while US whistleblower Edward Snowden called the iPhone a ""spyPhone"". Mr Federighi said the ""soundbyte"" that spread after the announcement was that Apple was scanning iPhones for images. ""That is not what is happening,"" he told the Wall Street Journal. ""We feel very positively and strongly about what we're doing and we can see that it's been widely misunderstood."" The tools are due to be added to the new versions of iOS and iPadOS later this year.

"France has recently introduced a new health pass which means proof of vaccination is needed to enter amenities People living in Scotland have spoken of holiday stress and frustration caused by the Scottish government's vaccine certificate system. Other UK nations use apps which provide a QR code as proof of vaccination, in line with a system used across Europe. However, people in Scotland have to request a paper certificate sent by post, which countries may not accept. Travel agents say Scottish travellers have been ""blindsided"" and in some cases may have to endure quarantines. The EU Digital Covid Certificate is available in all 27 member nations - plus Switzerland, Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein. The EU vaccine 'passport' and what it means for travel Do I need a vaccine certificate to travel? France rolls out health pass as cases soar Because the UK is no longer in the EU, the certificate is not available to most Britons, leading to a number of problems. The Scottish government has said it hopes to introduce a digital scheme next month. French-born Virginie Brouard, who owns the Edinburgh wine bar and restaurant Le De-Vin, travelled to Brittany in France with her children to visit her parents - whom she had not seen in two and a half years. France has recentlyrolled out a new health passwhich means people need proof of vaccination to enter places such as museums and cinemas. Virginie said she did not experience issues getting into the country, but said she was turned away from a cafÃ© because she did not have a QR code. She said there is concern in the area that if checks are not done correctly, businesses could close. She told BBC Radio Scotland'sDrivetime with John Beattie: ""It's been a stressful holiday to be honest. They don't like the piece of paper, they are all asking for a QR code and it's all on the phone - I'm lucky that Brittany is a bit more laid back. Virginie does not agree with mandatory vaccination certificates ""They don't really like the AstraZeneca vaccine either but I have only been rejected once - we just went for a coffee, I went to order and when the woman came to check our vaccine passport I said I only had the paper. ""She said she didn't want us to stay. That was not nice, I have to say I'm not too happy with the entire situation."" Virginie said her Â£400 bill for PCR tests had caused further stress as she could not be assured her family's results would arrive on time for their return journey on Sunday. However, she believes asking people to prove their vaccination status is not just impractical, but a moral issue. ""We have to respect everybody's situation,""she said. ""I'm not a scientist or politician but I don't like it - it's not right, especially when there is no vaccination for children.

Last August, businessman Derek Douglas took his yacht to Bergen on the west coast of Norway, where it has been stranded ever since. The 67-year-old former chairman of Maggie's Centres has been attempting to re-enter Norway over the summer, but cannot get permission from the authorities because of his paper vaccine certificate. The country only accepts Norwegian, Danish, Swedish or EU digital Covid certificates as proof of vaccination or previous illness. Derek Douglas' yacht is stranded in Norway Derek said: ""I've spoken to the guy in charge of the border police at Bergen airport and offered my NHS login details but they said they can't do that - they can only scan QR codes. ""I don't mind not being able to access amenities but I've left my boat there since August. It's more frustrating as it looks like the Scottish government weren't looking ahead, someone should have woken up to the idea. ""I can't have a holiday in Norway - I wanted to go exploring and can't do that as most people stop sailing at the end of September due to the wind and low temperatures. It was supposed to be a bit of an adventure. I'm an older guy and you've got to pack these things in while you can."" Digital vaccine certificates to replace paper versions Last month the Scottish government confirmed that a digital scheme would replace the paper vaccination certificates. It awarded a Â£600,000 contract to a Danish firm to develop the digital system, which is expected to launch in September. The Scottish government said: ""We are developing an app to make it easier to show Covid status for international travel. ""This will include vaccination records and we aim to release this next month."" However Linda Hill, of the West Kilbride travel agent LAH Travel and part of the Scottish Passenger Agents Association, told the BBC she was ""dumbfounded"" by the Scottish government's decision to continue posting certificates by first-class mail. She said: ""The cost of that when the rest of the UK has a digital pass, I don't understand why we're not all just using the same thing. ""The protocols for every destination are so different - it's a very challenging time to have to tell people what happens in Spain is different from France etc. ""Most countries don't ask for a PCR test to come back in, they recommend it but will accept an antigen test which is a lot cheaper. ""In France you're going to have a digital pass which we don't have. Once again it feels like the Scottish traveller is being blindsided. ""Please check what your regulations are because we are hearing if you don't have the digital certificate you have to quarantine on arrival."" RULES:What are the restrictions in your area?

"Daniela Espirito Santo reported her boyfriend seven times in less than a year before her death in 2020 No standards were breached by police when a woman died while on hold reporting a domestic assault, a watchdog has said. Daniela Espirito Santo, 23, from Grantham, reported partner Julio Jesus for attacking her while on bail for another assault the same day. He was charged with manslaughter but that was dropped over lack of evidence linking the attack and her death. He was instead charged with assault and jailed for 10 months. A report by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), whichwas leaked to the New York Times,external, detailed seven calls from Ms Espirito Santo about her partner between May 2019 and April 2020. During her final 999 call on 8 April 2020, she reported being attacked hours after Jesus was released on police bail for an assault earlier that day in which he pinned her down and pushed his arm against her throat. The 999 call handler deemed the call non-urgent as Jesus had left the home and told Ms Espirito Santo to ring back on the non-emergency 101 number. Eight minutes later, when the non-emergency call handler answered, all she could hear were the distraught cries of a baby. When police forced entry to Ms Espirito Santo's flat, they found her slumped on the sofa cradling her six-month-old son. Daniela Espirito Santo died while on hold to report a second attack by her partner in one day Following her death, Julio Jesus was arrested on suspicion of manslaughter. A post-mortem examination found Ms Espirito Santo had died from a pre-existing heart condition and that there was a possible link between the stress of the assault and her heart failing. However, after further reviewing medical evidence, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said it did not believe it could sufficiently prove ""an evidential link"" between the assault and her death and dropped the manslaughter charge. A spokeswoman for the CPS said: ""Julio Jesus was originally charged with the manslaughter of Daniela Espirito Santo on the basis that his actions that day triggered a fatal complication from a pre-existing heart condition. ""As the case neared trial, and following review of further expert medical reports, it became apparent we could not prove an evidential link between Ms Santo's tragic heart failure and what occurred that day between her and Mr Jesus. ""We contacted Ms Santo's family to explain the way the evidence in this case led to this conclusion. Our thoughts and sympathies are with her loved ones at this difficult time,"" the spokeswoman added. Instead, Jesus was convicted for two assaults and jailed. Charly Price-Wallace, a friend of Ms Espirito Santo's, has called for greater protection for victims of domestic abuse who are scared to press charges against their partners. ""They had record of seven incidents which contained 10 attacks that Dani had disclosed and yet didn't see a pattern or do anything about it. ""We need to make sure her name means something - that she didn't die in vain."" Charly Price-Wallace says she wants more to be done to protect vulnerable domestic abuse victims scared to press charges Copies of police reports in the IOPC investigation show how the abuse escalated over the course of a year from threats to kill, to controlling and coercive behaviour and strangulation. The IOPC also found that Lincolnshire Police had not failed in any of their standards during multiple contacts with Ms Espirito Santo. However, the IOPC said there was a ""learning recommendation"" in relation to the need for a force-wide written policy on when to transfer calls directly to the non-emergency 101 service rather than asking people to call back themselves, and any actions to be taken by 999 operators when taking that action. A spokeswoman for Lincolnshire Police said it would not be possible to comment until the conclusion of an inquest into Ms Espirito Santo's death. A Domestic Homicide Review, which is a multi-agency review of the circumstances in which a person's death has, or appears to have, resulted from violence, abuse or neglect by a person to whom they were in an intimate personal relationship, is under way.

"Navjot Sawhney set up the Washing Machine Project in 2018 The first batch of 30 hand-cranked washing machines, invented by a student for those living in poverty, has been sent to a camp in northern Iraq. Former University of Bath student, Navjot Sawhney, set up the Washing Machine Project in 2018 after being inspired by a salad spinner. Since then volunteers and businesses have given their time for free to help make the low-cost machines. Mr Sawhney said he was ""so proud"" of what had been achieved. He said up to 70% of the world's population do not have access to electric washing machines. Working with humanitarian charity Care International he is now aiming to deliver 7,500 of his manual washer and dryers to those most in need in 10 countries including Lebanon, Kenya and India over the next three years. Mr Sawhney came up with the idea after quitting his engineering job in Wiltshire to volunteer in India, where he saw the struggle of his next-door neighbour - a woman called Divya. ""It was through the frustration of seeing her daily struggles, hand washing her and her family's clothes, that I promised her a manual washing machine,"" he said. The manual washer and dryer is designed to be ""robust, simple to use and easily repairable"" Named the Divya, in her honour, the ""robust, simple to use and easily repairable"" machine has been tested in countries around the world. Mr Sawhney said the reaction has been ""phenomenal"". ""Hand washing clothes is very time consuming, and nobody likes hand washing their clothes, so as a problem everybody understands it,"" he said. ""We've been so lucky. We've had universities, companies and people who just want to give up their time, and that's such a humbling thought for me."" Matt Mew said his company wanted to help make life easier for those living in poverty Among those helping out is a Bristol design and fabrication firm, Huxlo, which makes all of the PVC and wooden parts. ""We gave up our time to make this happen, because it's a really worthwhile project,"" said Matt Mew, from Huxlo. ""It's super rewarding to see this go from just a sketch to an actual product going out and helping people."" The University of Bath, where Mr Sawhney studied, has also helped turn his designs into reality. ""We've been able to throw some ideas back to him [Mr Sawhney] and very quickly come up with some solutions,"" said university technician Owen Rutter. Owen Rutter, a technician at the University of Bath, said they have been ""on call"" to help with the project Mr Sawhney, said he will be heading to Iraq at the beginning of September to help distribute the machines.

"Esther Dingley sent this selfie at the top of a mountain on 22 November The death of a British hiker in the Pyrenees was an accident, French police have said. Esther Dingley's remains were found by her partner Daniel Colegate on Monday more than eight months after she disappeared during a solo trek. A source told the BBC she suffered injuries associated with a fall and though the cause was unclear, her shoes ""were not adequate for icy conditions"". The judge in charge of the inquiry said her body may be repatriated next week. Daniel Colegate walked hundreds of miles in the search for his missing partner Esther Dingley The BBC's Chris Bockman in Toulouse said an autopsy and an examination of her rucksack had been carried out by forensic teams. He said it was ""unclear"" how the accident had happened but police believe the hiking shoes she was wearing several thousand metres up a mountain ""did not have the grip necessary for the icy conditions at the time and she probably slipped and fell"". He also said French officers had confirmed Mr Colegate, who was 100 miles away in France when Ms Dingley, 37, disappeared, was not a suspect. Ms Dingley was an experienced hiker LBT Global, a charity which is supporting Ms Dingley's family, had said her death was probably an accident ""given the location and other early indications"". Ms Dingley, who was an experienced hiker, was trekking alone when shelast communicated with her partnerfrom the top of Pic de Sauvegarde at about 16:00 on 22 November. Mr Colegate raised the alarm several days later when she failed to report in at an agreed time. The couple from Durham wereon an open-ended campervan tour of Europeand Ms Dingley was on the final walk of a month-long solo expedition when she died.

"Eve Aston was remembered by her mother as 'very jolly, sassy, sociable' The mother of a Manchester Arena bombing survivor says she is ""so proud to have had her in my life"" after the 20-year-old was found dead at home. Amanda Aston remembered daughter Eve as ""very jolly, sassy, sociable"". The cause of death is not yet known. Ms Aston's family said she had suffered post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the wake of the 2017 blast at an Ariana Grande concert and had been ""getting back to her old self"" in the weeks before she died. Her body was found in her room at home in Wolverhampton on 23 July. ""I'm heartbroken, I can't believe it's happened,"" Mrs Aston said. Twenty-two people died and hundreds more were injured in the 2017 attack Mrs Aston described singer Grande as the ""absolute idol"" of her daughter who, aged 17 at the time, was ""so, so happy"" to have tickets to the show.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson says Britain's involvement in Afghanistan was ""right, it was worth it"" Boris Johnson has said the UK can be ""extremely proud"" of its role in Afghanistan, despite the situation in the country having ""deteriorated"". The UK will evacuate the ""vast bulk"" of its embassy staff in the coming days asthe Taliban continues to advance. The prime minister said there was ""no military solution"" after an emergency Cobra meeting on Friday afternoon. On Thursday, the UK said it wouldsend 600 troops to help evacuate British nationals and former Afghan staff. Thousands of civilians have fled the Taliban onslaught, heading for the capital of Kabul. The World Food Programme has warned that food shortages are ""dire"", while the UN has urged Afghanistan's neighbours to keep their borders open. The militants now control about a third of Afghanistan's provincial capitals, including Herat, Ghazni and Lashkar Gar. Who are the Taliban? Taliban back brutal rule as they strike for power Young Afghan women fear for future under Taliban Mr Johnson insisted there was no military solution following the gains made by the Taliban in recent days and said that a team of Home Office officials would be sent to step up efforts to relocate Afghans who worked for British forces in the country. ""It is very difficult obviously, but I think the UK can be extremely proud of what has been done in Afghanistan over the last 20 years,"" he said. The prime minister said that thanks to the efforts of the UK armed services there had been no al-Qaeda attacks on the West for ""a very long time"". He also added that three million girls and young women in Afghanistan had been educated who otherwise would not have been, during the last 20 years. ""I think we've got to be realistic about the abilities of the UK or any power to impose a military solution, a combat solution in Afghanistan,"" Mr Johnson said. ""What we certainly can do is work with all our partners in the region and around the world who share an interest with us in preventing Afghanistan from once again becoming a breeding ground for terror."" This video can not be played Lisa Nandy says Afghanistan was a âhumanitarian crisis unfolding in front of our eyesâ Earlier, Lisa Nandy, Labour's shadow foreign secretary, told BBC Radio 4's World At One programme there was ""far more"" the UK could do to support the people of Afghanistan and accused the government of ""hiding"". She warned the government that cross-party MPs could push to recall Parliament to hold the government to account if it did not show a clear strategy. Ms Nandy said that people in the country felt ""abandoned"" and were looking to the US and UK for ""a level of leadership"". This video can not be played The BBC's  Secunder Kermani reports on life in a town recently taken by the Taliban Her concerns were echoed by former Conservative Defence Minister Johnny Mercer, who served in Afghanistan. He described the situation in the country as a ""world tragedy"" which would have repercussions ""for years to come"". Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey has also backed the idea of recalling Parliament ""given the tragedy unfolding before our eyes"" and called on the UN to deploy peacekeepers. Earlier, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace acknowledged thatthe country could be ""heading towards civil war"". He blamed former US President Donald Trump's ""rotten deal"" with the Taliban in 2020 for the withdrawal. The UK governmenthas launched ""Operation Pitting"",,externalto help evacuate British nationals, former UK staff and others who are eligible to relocate to the UK. Mr Wallace said around 600 troops were being sent to Afghanistan to ensure the safe return of about 500 Foreign Office and other UK government officials, along with around 3,000 British citizens working in other roles, such as security guards for aid agencies. About 2,000 Afghan interpreters and ""other people we have an obligation to"" would also be transported to the UK, he said, joining some 3,000 who had already been taken out of the country. RAF aircraft could be used if needed and the Home Office would also be deploying a small team of officials to assist with processing new visas, the Ministry of Defence said. This video can not be played Defence Secretary Ben Wallace: ""I think we are heading towards a civil war"" The US said it would have the bulk of the 3,000 troops it is sending to assist with evacuation in place by the end of the weekend. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby added that the US military was ""certainly concerned about the speed with which the Taliban is moving"". Nato said it had discussed the situation on Friday and would aim to support the Afghan government and security forces ""as much as possible"". Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the Taliban would not be recognised by the international community if it took the country by force, adding that there was deep concern about reports of serious human rights abuses. People fleeing the Taliban are flooding into the capital of Kabul Wendy Rayner, whose husband Peter died in action in Helmand province in 2010, said the withdrawal undermined the sacrifice of soldiers who had lost their lives. ""My husband died to give them a better life, and by them not having a better life, it's taken away his fight,"" she told the BBC. ""All these young people in Afghanistan that are having their families slaughtered because nobody cares, because we've just left them in the lurch - it's just going to create another terror threat. They're going to hate us and I don't blame them."" Mr Johnson said he did not think the sacrifices made by British forces were ""in vain"". ""I believe it was right, it was worth it and what we must do now is not turn our backs on Afghanistan,"" he said. INSOMNIA AND ME:Why are thousands of young people struggling with sleep disorders?

"Eve Aston was remembered by her mother as 'very jolly, sassy, sociable' The mother of a Manchester Arena bombing survivor says she is ""so proud to have had her in my life"" after the 20-year-old was found dead at home. Amanda Aston remembered daughter Eve as ""very jolly, sassy, sociable"". The cause of death is not yet known. Ms Aston's family said she had suffered post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the wake of the 2017 blast at an Ariana Grande concert and had been ""getting back to her old self"" in the weeks before she died. Her body was found in her room at home in Wolverhampton on 23 July. ""I'm heartbroken, I can't believe it's happened,"" Mrs Aston said. Twenty-two people died and hundreds more were injured in the 2017 attack Mrs Aston described singer Grande as the ""absolute idol"" of her daughter who, aged 17 at the time, was ""so, so happy"" to have tickets to the show. Twenty-two people were killed and hundreds more injured when suicide bomber Salman Abedi detonated a homemade device at the end of the concert. Although physically uninjured, Ms Aston's family said she bore mental scars from the night.

The family set up a GoFundMe page to raise money for the 20-year-old's funeral, which has so far generated almost Â£8,000. ""She was a wonderful person, so precious,"" Mrs Aston remembered.

"There's been renewed focus on firearm laws in the UK after five people were killed by a registered gun owner. Police say that Jake Davison,who shot himself after the attack in Plymouth, was a licensed firearms holder. There are two main categories - firearms and shotguns. A firearm is defined in the Firearms Act 1968 as any weapon ""from which a shot, bullet or other missile... can be discharged"". A shotgun is a type of gun intended to fire a large number of small pellets rather than a single lead bullet or slug. It is more difficult to get a licence for firearms than for shotguns, because weapons that fire bullets must only be used for specific purposes in specific places. These would include deer stalking or sports shooting on an approved range. In contrast, shotguns tend to be used in more general rural circumstances, such as by farmers who are protecting livestock from foxes - and police recognise that landowners need guns for pest control. According to themost recent figures for England and Wales,external, there are 156,033 people certificated to hold firearms and they own 617,171 weapons. There are shotgun certificates which cover 1.4 million shotguns. Statistics for Scotland show that 70,839 firearms were held by 25,983 certificate holders in 2020. 46,703 people in Scotland are certificated to hold shotguns - and 133,037 weapons are covered by that scheme. Gun laws in the UK are among the toughest in the world. The police are in charge of issuing shotgun and firearm certificates in England, Scotland and Wales. Local forces administer the system rather than a central body, because they will have local information that will inform their judgement. A decision on whether someone gets a licence is the responsibility of the chief officer in that area. Getting a licence is a long and complicated business. It starts with an application form which asks specific questions about why the individual wants a gun, telling them they need to show ""good reason"". This might be that they need it for their profession or sport. A simple wish to own a particular type of firearm is not in itself enough. They must also prove that they are allowed to have a firearms certificate and pose no danger to public safety or to the peace. Independent referees have to provide confidential character statements in which they are expected to answer in detail about the applicant's mental state, home life and attitude towards guns. Officers check the Police National Computer for a criminal record - anyone who has served a prison sentence of more than three years is banned for life from holding a firearms licence. GPs can be contacted if someone has listed a relevant medical condition, including neurological conditions or mental health disorders. Otherwise, GPs are contacted after certification, when they can raise concerns. A note is added to the medical records of a firearm certificate holder. Finally, senior officers must be sure that prospective shotgun holders have a secure location for the weapon, typically a dedicated gun cabinet. Each certificate is valid for five years. Shooting at the 2012 London Paralympics: firearm licences can be granted for sporting reasons Chief police officers have the right to revoke a licence or not to renew it. Police chiefs can revoke certificates if they conclude that the holder can no longer be trusted: In 2020/21, 306 firearm certificates were revoked in England and Wales In 2019/20, 49 firearms certificates were revoked in Scotland Failure to use the firearm or failure to acquire one by the end of the certificate's life could also lead to a licence not being renewed. The two most important laws on gun control in the UK came in the wake of two national tragedies. Michael Ryan's massacre of 16 people in Hungerford in 1987 led to the banning of all modern semi-automatic rifles, the type of guns that can be fired rapidly without needing to be reloaded. Nine years later, Thomas Hamilton killed 16 schoolchildren and their teacher when he opened fire at a school in Dunblane. Parliament banned all handguns and there is now a mandatory five-year jail sentence for possession. TheSmall Arms Survey,externalestimated there were 978,000 unregistered firearms in England, Scotland and Wales in 2018, and 53,000 in Northern Ireland. Mass shootings are extremely rare in the UK. Before this year, there had been four in modern times - the last one was in Cumbria in 2010,when a gunman killed 12 people. Meanwhile, in 2019 alone, there were 417 shootings in the US whereat least four people were shot,external. People in Northern Ireland can hold firearms certificates for activities including sporting and pest control. In 2020, there were 55,441 firearm certificate holders. Unlike in the rest of the UK, handguns are not banned in Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK where you can own a gun for self-defence. People can apply for a ""personal protection weapon"" certificate. These are granted if a person is seen to be at ""real and immediate risk"" and a gun is seen as ""reasonable, proportionate and necessary to protect the life of the applicant"".

"Jamie Spears has been his daughter's conservator since 2008 Britney Spears' father has agreed to step down as the singer's conservator, pledging to participate in an ""orderly transition"" to a new legal arrangement. The pop star's lawyer said it was ""a major victory for Britney Spears and another step toward justice"". However, Jamie Spears' lawyer insisted there were ""no actual grounds"" for him to step back and gave no timetable for when he would relinquish his role. The singer's career has been in the hands of legal guardians since 2008. She filed a petitionto stop her father controlling her estate in July and has said she will not perform again while he remains in the role. In court papers filed on Thursday in response to the star's petition, Mr Spears' lawyer said he would be ""in a position to step aside"" when certain matters were resolved, and ""when the time is right"". Mr Spears, the 15-page filing states, ""intends to work with the court and his daughter's new attorney to prepare for an orderly transition to a new conservator"". Britney Spears is in a legal battle to end the conservatorship Mr Spears' lawyer said he did not believe ""a public battle with his daughter... would be in her best interests"" and that he had been ""the unremitting target of unjustified attacks"". Nevertheless, he called for his daughter's ""flawed"" petition to be denied, saying it was ""unjustified"" and that there were ""no urgent circumstances justifying Mr Spears' immediate suspension"". Jamie Spears' response to his daughter's petition was welcomed by her lawyer Mathew Rosengart, who called it a ""vindication"" for his client. ""We are pleased that Mr Spears and his lawyer have today conceded in a filing that he must be removed,"" he said in a statement. Yet he accused Jamie Spears of his own ""shameful and reprehensible attacks"" and said he should stop ""making false accusations and taking cheap shots"". He said the singer's father should instead ""remain silent and step aside immediately"". Mr Rosengart added that an investigation into the actions of those involved in managing her estate throughout the conservatorship would continue. The news was welcomed by one of her fellow celebrities, the model and heiress Paris Hilton. ""I'm so happy to hear this news,""she wrote on Twitter,external. ""It's been so long overdue but I'm so glad that Britney is on her way to finally being free."" But some of the singer's supporters, who have campaigned for her to regain autonomy over her affairs using the #FreeBritney hashtag, expressed scepticism. Campaigner Leanne Simmons,externaldismissed the move as ""another manipulation tactic"", whileanother fan said,externalthere was ""still plenty of work to do"". This video can not be played Britney Spears: Fans speak out against conservatorship Lisa MacCarley, a US conservatorship lawyer and #FreeBritney advocate, said it was a ""significant"" development in the ongoing dispute. ""I'm sure Britney is feeling a lot of relief,"" she told BBC Breakfast on Friday. ""The only question is how soon this is going to take place. ""It really depends on what conditions Jamie's attorneys put on his resignation."" The conservatorship arrangement was imposed in 2008 when concerns were raised over her mental health. The court-ordered agreement gave Jamie Spears control over his daughter's estate and other aspects of her life. The conservatorship is split into two parts. One is for her estate and financial affairs, while the other is for her as a person. Mr Spears stepped down as his daughter's personal conservator in 2019 due to health issues but has continued to oversee her business arrangements. The Britney Spears conservatorship case explained Britney: I won't perform while father rules career In recent months, she has sought to remove him from his role and has called for him to be charged with ""conservatorship abuse"". The 39-year-old told a judge that she had been drugged, forced to perform against her will and prevented from having children. Mr Spears has consistently denied any accusations of wrongdoing and has expressed concern for his daughter's wellbeing. The prolonged legal row gained renewed attention earlier this year following the release of Framing Britney Spears, a documentary that centred on the conflict over the singer's guardianship.

"Some local councils are supporting plans for new roads despite declaring a ""climate emergency"" More than a third of English councils support policies that could increase carbon emissions despite having declared a ""climate emergency"", BBC research suggests. Road building and airport expansion are among examples provided by 45 out of 121 questionnaire respondents who say they have passed climate motions. Environmentalists say the findings reveal ""inconsistencies"" in approach. Local leaders insist they are taking action but need more funding. Between March and June the BBC surveyed all 149 top tier councils in England, of which 136 responded. Almost nine in 10 councils (121 out of 136 respondents, 89%) have declared a ""climate emergency"" Of those, more than one in three councils (45 out of 121 respondents, 37%) said they supported at least one policy that could increase carbon emissions, such as new road building or airport expansion About two-thirds of councils (91 out of 136 respondents, 67%) said the pandemic had affected their plans to tackle climate change. The government has committed to cutting greenhouse gases to almost zero by 2050 - this target is known as net zero. This means reducing emissions as far as possible, then balancing out any remaining releases by, for example, tree planting. The similar term of carbon neutrality refers to doing this for CO2 emissions rather than all greenhouse gases. COP26 'should be hybrid event' says ex-climate chief Do governments meet their green targets? A really simple guide to climate change The BBC's findings highlight the tensions faced by councils trying to balance economic, social and environmental challenges. Leeds, for example, aims to become a carbon neutral city by 2030, but the city council also backs plans to upgrade Leeds Bradford Airport. Helen Hayden, councillor for infrastructure and climate for Leeds City Council, told BBC News: ""It would seem like an inconsistency. I would say that in terms of carbon emissions the airport accounts for 1.5% of our carbon emissions. ""So we do have to keep it in context and not let it distract us from doing all those things that will actually tackle the bigger issues that are in our city. ""We need that National Policy framework so that Leeds Bradford airport does not feel it is being punished as opposed to other airports in the country - and we can therefore work with them to get our green and sustainable future."" Our survey covers England, but you would find similar results in many places round the globe. Politicians face unenviable tensions. On one hand, there's concern for existing businesses and jobs. On the other hand, there's the plea from scientists for radical emissions cuts. It's taken decades for the climate message to be heard among the clamour of voters' demands for housing, transport and education. Many councils and governments are now on a path towards curbing emissions - many are just moving far too slowly. Take Leeds. It aspires to be a leading green city, and in many ways it is. But recently, after a marathon debate, its councillors backed an upgrade of the city's airport. This will increase the emissions the council is committed to eliminate. Councillors backed it because it will improve the image of the city - and because they feared holidaymakers would use another airport. Tower Hamlets is committed to achieving net zero carbon by 2025, but has also backed the construction of the Silvertown Tunnel under the Thames. ""East London has suffered from a lack of river crossings and the Silvertown Tunnel will offer the prospect of a solution to the terrible air quality and congestion problems at Blackwall Tunnel,"" a spokesperson for the council said. Shropshire Council is supporting efforts to make the county carbon neutral by 2030, while also pursuing the delivery of an Â£87m North West Relief Road in Shrewsbury. However, it adds that the ring road would bring environmental benefits through new walking and cycling routes. Pressure is growing on the government ahead of the Glasgow climate summit in November Dr Neil Jennings, partnership development manager at the Grantham Institute for Climate Change at Imperial College London, said many councils have ""shown leadership"" but there are ""apparent inconsistencies"" in approach. ""It's hard to see how airport expansion or investment in major new road building are consistent with net zero aspirations,"" he said. The National Audit Office said in arecent report,externalthat government support for councils trying to tackle climate change was inadequate and under-funded. The environmental campaign group Friends of the Earth is calling for the introduction of a legal duty for councils to take UK climate change targets into account when considering planning applications. ""We won't come close to confronting the climate crisis if coal mines and airport expansions are approved,"" it said. Environmental groups are calling for councils to have a legal duty to consider climate change in planning applications Alongside their declarations, councils highlighted hundreds of green projects to tackle climate change. Some of the more innovative ideas include the funding of two deep geothermal power projects in Cornwall, per gram CO2 charges for parking permits in Kensington and Chelsea, turning Newcastle into a ""15 minute city"" requiring minimal travel, one of the longest living green walls in the UK in Liverpool, and the trialling of electric car hire at a library in Staffordshire. Councils that had not declared a climate ""emergency"" insisted they were still committed to tackling climate change. While some councils reported that the pandemic had had a positive effect on their plans to tackle change, more said the impact had been negative. In Dorset, the drop in road traffic brought about an estimated 27% reduction in carbon emissions, according to the council. ""This shows us as a society what is possible in a short time when 'business as usual' is adjusted. We must not lose some of these gains and rush back to how things were before the pandemic,"" it added. However, St Helen's Council said the pandemic had had a ""major impact"" on council resources. ""The commitments remain the same but progressing actions in respect of climate change have stalled,"" it added. Councils say they need more funding to plan for decarbonisation The Isle of Wight Council said the Covid-19 response had delayed the delivery of its climate strategy, meaning the original aim of achieving net zero carbon emissions on the island by 2030 is likely to be ""pushed back"" to 2040. Cllr David Renard from the Local Government Association said: ""Net zero can only be achieved if decarbonisation happens in every place, community and household. Long-term funding for councils would mean they can properly plan ahead on the needs of their local communities as a whole to support this."" A government spokesperson said councils had already been provided with billions in funding.

"US troops reportedly begin to arrive in Kabul to help with the evacuation of diplomats, as the Taliban move closer to the city Several European nations are also evacuating non-essential embassy staff or temporarily closing their embassies The militants continue their rapid offensive, seizing more territory and capturing key cities Kandahar, the country's second largest city and a key trading hub, has fallen to the insurgents The group now controls most of northern Afghanistan and more than a third of its regional capitals. Tens of thousands of civilians have fled the Taliban advance. About 1,000 have been killed in the past month, the UN says Many of the internally displaced have travelled to Kabul and are sleeping in makeshift camps or on the streets It comes as US and other foreign troops withdraw after 20 years of military operations Edited by Flora Drury Weâre now pausing our coverage for today but will be keeping our
main story updated. Here are
some of the key points from today:  The writers on the live page today have been Sophie Williams, Victoria Bisset, Josh Cheetham, Jack Hunter, Kelly-Leigh Cooper and Max Matza. The page was edited by Flora Drury and Alix Kroeger. Some expatriate Afghans have been sharing their frustrations with trying to help loved ones stranded in Kabul. One
German resident who contacted the BBC said his relatives had requested special
immigrant visas for the US, which he says they are eligible for. However, they
are still waiting. âThey
are in a very bad situation, but the thing is, all the embassies are closed
because of corona. I donât know what will happen with my family. Thatâs why I
want to share my pain and my sadness with people and say just help Afghanistan,â
he said. They
have considered going through a third country such as Tajikistan. But again, the
embassies are closed. âI
speak to my family every day. Many days Iâm in my German class but my mind, my
focus, everything is in Afghanistan. Iâm thinking about my family. âI donât
know what will happen. My family are afraid. Just last night I talked with my
sister and she was crying. I told her be safe, take care, donât go outside.â He
appealed for the US and UK to remain for some time. âBecause
of their colleagues, because of those people who work for peace, construction,
childrenâs rights and womenâs rights."" Mr Guterres said it was heartbreaking that hard-won rights were being ripped away from Afghan women As we mentioned earlier, UN Secretary-General Antonio
Guterres, warned that Afghanistan is spinning out of control. He also said he was âdeeply disturbed by early indications
that the Taliban are imposing severe restrictions on human rights in the areas
under their control, particularly targeting women and journalistsâ. âIt is particularly horrifying and heart-breaking to see
reports of the hard-won rights of Afghan girls and women being ripped away from
them,â he said. Under the previous period of Taliban rule in 1996-2001, women had to cover their faces and be
accompanied by a male family member when leaving the house. By Bahman Kalbasi, BBC Persian As news of Taliban forcesâ rapid takeover of
major cities raised concerns about the deteriorating
situation in Afghanistan, BBC Persian spoke to a US-based women's rights and peace activist. When asked about her take on the developments
in her homeland, Malalai Habibi became visibly upset and listed prominent Afghan women who had long and repeatedly warned of a Taliban takeover and what it would mean for millions of women and children. âAll of this was predicted: Taliban murdering civilians, slaughtering
women, forced marriages for women, all of it. What's there left to say that we
havenât warned about already?â Malalai asked. But sadly, she said, no-one had heard
their voices: âNot the media, not the politicians and not the international
community, and now the people of Afghanistan are falling victims to the dirty, domestic and international politics.â Malalai was no longer in the mood to talk. Given that
the voices of Afghan women are now ignored, she said she hoped her silence would instead gain attention. She then taped over her mouth. Allow Twitter content?

Some 600 personnel are involved in Operation Pitting As US troops arrive in Kabul, the UK government has also announced the beginning of its operation to evacuate British nationals and others eligible to relocate to the UK. Six hundred troops have begun deploying to support the evacuations as part of Operation Pitting, while officials will also be sent to help speed up processing visas and other documents from Afghanistan,according to a government statement,external. RAF aircraft could be used if needed. More than 2,000 local members of staff who worked with the UK in Afghanistan have been relocated to the UK along with their families since April this year, the government says. The UK has urged all British nationals to leave the country immediately in response to the deteriorating security situation, providing emergency travel documents and loans where appropriate. Danish Foreign Minister Jeppe Kofod has announced that Denmark will be closing its embassy in the Afghan capital for now, as the security situation deteriorates. All employees at the embassy are being evacuated, he added, calling on all Danes to leave the country immediately. Just yesterday, Denmark announced that it would be suspending deportations of rejected Afghan asylum seekers to Afghanistan until 8 October - joining a growing list of European countries doing the same. The decision was an about turn. Last week, Denmark and five other EU nations signed a letter to the European Commission, insisting on their right to forcibly deport Afghan asylum seekers whose cases had been rejected. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby says that the US is ""able to move thousands"" of evacuees out of the country each day. The estimate came after he was asked about the plan to rescue interpreters and other Afghans who have worked with the US government. ""But that's just the air lift capacity. That doesn't necessarily mean that you're going to end up with that everyday,"" he said from the Pentagon in Virginia. ""It's going to depend on the processing in, and how that goes,"" he added. ""So what we want to be able to do is get there fast... and be able to provide as much capacity to the State Department as we can and our intention is to be able to move thousands per day."" Our correspondent has been sharing some thoughts Ghani hosts an event at the presidential palace in Kabul earlier this month President Ashraf Ghani has ruled out the idea of resigning, multiple sources have told the BBCâs Secunder Kermani in Afghanistan. Secunder reports that the Taliban strategy now appears to be one of isolating Afghanistanâs central leadership in Kabul, and either making a military push into the city or waiting for international pressure on Ghani to step down. Meanwhile, a key Taliban opponent who surrendered this week has been rallying other warlords to capitulate. âThis is what Taliban mean by power sharing,â Secunder says about the deals being made between the Taliban and independent warlords, rather than with the internationally-backed central government. âSince the Moscow conference in 2019 I got the sense theyâre happy to make deals with power brokers like Ismail Khan,â says Secunder, referring to the captured anti-Taliban figure. âThat means they wonât face constant war, and they can say itâs not monopoly rule. âNo room for Ghani in their vision, though.â As we reported earlier, former US President Donald Trump has issued a statement on the ""tragic mess in Afghanistan"", taking it as as an opportunity to ask Americans ""do you miss me yet?"". His spokeswoman added on Twitter: ""Trump bombed Taliban to negotiating table; Biden let them waltz to Kandahar."" But earlier today,UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallacelaid the blame for the present situation squarely at Mr Trump's door. Speaking to BBC Breakfast, he described former Mr Trump's previous agreement with the Taliban as a ""rotten deal"" that potentially undermined the Afghan government. ""We as international partners found it uncomfortable because we had deployed through a US framework... so when they pulled that framework, we had to leave."" These images from today show how the country has been affected by the Taliban advance. The militants are continuing their rapid offensive, seizing more territory and capturing key cities. Thousands of people have been forced to flee their homes. The US and UK have sent troops to the capital Kabul in order to evacuate nationals. Taliban militants gather after taking control of Lashkar Gah People stranded at the Pakistan- Afghani border wait to cross UK troops board a flight as they are deployed to Afghanistan A senior US State Department official has deleted a tweet expressing sympathy for the women of Afghanistan. ""Woke up with a heavy heart, thinking about all the Afghan women and girls I worked with during my time in Kabul,"" wrote Deputy Assistant Secretary for European and Eurasian Affairs Molly Montgomery. ""They were the beneficiaries of many of the gains we made, and now they stand to lose everything,"" she added. âWe empowered them to lead, and now we are powerless to protect them.â A spokesperson later told Fox News that she ""deleted the tweet on her own volition"". This video can not be played âNot an Afghanistan problem but a humanity problemâ - Gen McMaster It is unfair to say Afghans need to fight against Taliban militants by themselves, the former US national security adviser Gen HR McMaster has said. The militants are ""the enemies of all civilisation, of all humanity"", he told the BBC's Yalda Hakim on Thursday. ""Afghanistan is spinning out of control,"" United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned on Friday, calling for an immediate halt to the Taliban offensive. ""The message from the international community to those on the warpath must be clear: seizing power through military force is a losing proposition,"" he told reporters. ""That can only lead to prolonged civil war or to the complete isolation of Afghanistan."" Taliban militants at the governor's house in Ghazni city on Thursday US Pentagon spokesman John Kirby says the US military is ""certainly concerned about the speed with which the Taliban is moving"". Asked if the US is concerned that the Afghans will not mount a strong defence of Kabul, Kirby hits back: ""That's a question for Afghan leadership to determine for themselves."" ""This is a moment for the Afghans to unite â the leadership and the military,"" he added. Kirby refused to discuss the rules of engagement for US soldiers who have just arrived in Afghanistan to help embassy staff in Kabul. ""Kabul is not, right now, in an imminent threat environment,"" he continued, adding that the Taliban is moving to isolate the city. Back when the Taliban ruled Afghanistan, women faced many restrictions on their daily lives: girls were banned from schools, while women were only allowed to leave their homes if they covered their faces and were accompanied by a close male relative. The movement insists it's changed in the 20 years since it was forced from power, but some women have told a very different story since the militants began their rapid advance across the county. Noor Khatera, 43, was one of nine women ordered to leave their office at the Azizi Bank in the southern city of Kandahar in July, according to Reuters news agency. Just two days later, a similar scene unfolded at a bank in the city of Herat in the west of the country. ""It's really strange to not be allowed to get to work, but now this is what it is,"" Noor told Reuters. ""I taught myself English and even learned how to operate a computer, but now I will have to look for a place where I can just work with more women around."" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby is now taking questions at a Pentagon briefing. He says that the US will continue to conduct airstrikes on behalf of the Afghan government, but says they are not a ""panacea"" for all security issues facing the country. ""We never argued that our airstrikes from the air were going to turn the tide on the ground,"" said Kirby. ""What we have said is the Afghans on the ground have the capacity to do that. ""They have the capability. They have the air force. They have the weaponry. It's indigenous forces that can make the difference on the ground."" Bernd DebusmannBBC Washington Zia Ghafoori says he cannot believe how quickly the country is falling to the Taliban A former Afghan interpreter who worked for the US military tells BBC News that he and other Afghans who have escaped the country are consumed with worry at the worsening security situation. âWe werenât expecting this, for the Taliban to take over so many places so quickly,"" says Zia Ghafoori, who was wounded while attached to a US Special Forces unit in 2008. ""We thought there was a back-up plan from the [the US and its coalition allies] to save the Afghan government and save Afghan families.â Speaking from the state of North Carolina, where he now lives, he continues: âI think children will not get to be children. Females will be taken from their homes and married to Taliban fighters.â âOur families are in danger right now. We donât know what to do, where to go, or whoâs going to take action. We could lose everybody.â Mr Ghafoori, 37, added that he is concerned for the fate of thousands of Afghan interpreters who remain in the country. âEveryone is worried about their families. Their parents. I fear theyâre going to get tortured,â Mr Ghafoori said. âSomeone must think about those families that are over there.â Read more:From Afghan interpreter to US homeless The Spanish government has said it is working to resettle translators who helped its forces in Afghanistan, news agency AFP reports.

Spain withdrew its final soldiers in May this year. Separately, Switzerland has said it will offer humanitarian visas to around 40 Afghan development agency workers and their families. Last week, the UK foreign secretary announced thatAfghan journalists who worked for the British media would be allowed to relocate to the UKif they are under ""imminent threat"" from the Taliban.

"This year's results showed a sharp increase from 2019, but fewer pupils from poorer backgrounds achieved A*-C grades There is a widening gap for top GCSE results between pupils from poorer backgrounds and others, figures show. This year's top results showed asharp increase from pre-Covid levelsin 2019. However, 52% of pupils who were eligible for free school meals got grades between A* and C.

"This video can not be played 'Teach children dangers of the Scottish waters' The family of a ""one in a million"" teenager who drowned in Loch Lomond have pleaded for lessons be be learned from his death. Connor Markward, 16, lost his life at the beauty spot near Balloch Country Park three weeks ago. He had been enjoying a day out with friends - oblivious to the dangers of the water he was swimming in. Now his grieving loved ones are calling for a safety campaign in schools to prevent a future tragedy. Connor's sister Claire Lindsay, 35, said: ""I never knew how dangerous Loch Lomond was. You don't understand until it happens to you. ""We are so heartbroken. He had a heart of gold."" Connor's sister Claire has been left heartbroken by the loss of her brother Connor's death was one of seven drownings in the space of a week last month in Scotland. An 11-year-old boy diedon 24 July after getting into difficulty in a river near Stonehouse, South Lanarkshire. On the same day, the body of a 13-year-old boy was recovered from the River Clyde near Lanark. An hour latera woman, her son and a family friend all diednear Pulpit Rock at Ardlui on Loch Lomond. And a 34-year-old man died a few daysafter being pulled from Loch Lubnaig. Connor's was one of a series of water-related deaths over a single weekend last month It was a tragic series of events over a weekend which Connor Markward's sister Claire will never get over. She said: ""The morning of the incident, he was away to enjoy himself. He only gave me half a cuddle that time because he was in such a rush. ""I told him to be careful and he said he would call me later. I can't believe he walked out this door and never came back."" Connor Markward was on a day out with friends when he died Claire told BBC Scotland that Connor could swim but was not confident in the water. She admitted she had no idea about safety advice for people who get into trouble in the water - including leaning back and extending your arms and legs. She said: ""I never knew how dangerous Loch Lomond was. I think they should teach about currents and how deep the water is in nurseries and schools. ""I didn't even know until after Connor passed that when you get into difficulty you are not supposed to panic and you should 'starfish' in the water. If you get taught thatâ¦ it could save people's lives."" Weekend of water deaths 'is worst in memory' Don't take a chance in open water, swimmers urged Connor's mother Margaret Lindsay described how her 16-year-old son, from Easterhouse in Glasgow, was planning an exciting new phase of his life when tragedy struck. She said: ""It hits me every morning. He gave me a kiss on the cheek and a cuddle every day. I am missing his smile. ""The morning before he left for Loch Lomond, he was talking about college and setting up his first bank account. He couldn't wait to get his provisional licence and to drive."" Margaret, 52, believes easier access to swimming lessons for youngsters in school may help prevent another family from suffering like hers. She continued: ""I had never heard you were supposed to do 'the star' to keep floating. I want more talks about swimming, learning to swim and awareness about the dangers."" This video can not be played Ross MacLeod, RNLI : ""Rest and relax in the water"" The RNLI say there are five steps to know how to float: If you fall in the water, fight your instinct to thrash around Lean back, extend your arms and legs If you need to, gently move them around to help you float Float until you can control your breathing Only then, call for help or swim to safety. Find out more about theRNLI's ""float to live"" campaign,external The Scottish government said its sympathies were with Connor Markward's family and confirmed a meeting had been held with emergency services and other organisations to identify ways of reducing future fatalities. Community Safety Minister Ash Denham said: ""Beautiful and enticing as they often appear, Scotland's waters can be a source of lethal danger as we saw with the heartbreaking loss of lives this summer. ""I was heartened to hear a real determination and unity of purpose at Wednesday's meeting for everyone to work together to improve water safety. ""I am encouraged all participants agreed not only to review their own organisation's approach and performance, but also to work collaboratively so that key, consistent messages get across to the public. ""We have agreed to come together again in a few weeks' time to assess what further effort is required to ensure greater protection for the public in future."" West Dunbartonshire Council, which is responsible for Balloch Country Park, told BBC Scotland it had recently bought 15 items of safety equipment. Officials said 21 locations have been identified on the shore of Loch Lomond within Balloch Country Park for the installation of new lifebelts, throw lines and signs. The local authority said these would be installed ""as soon as possible"". Loch Lomond & The Trossachs National Park Authority confirmed changes following Connor's death. Simon Jones, director of environment and visitor services, said: ""Our deepest sympathies go to the families of Connor and all of the others who died so tragically in water-related incidents over the last few weeks. ""In the immediate term, we have stepped up our water safety advice on the ground and online and encourage everyone to take some time to read about the dangers of the water in the national park and share this with their friends and family.""

"Six people, including a suspected gunman, have died in a shooting in Plymouth. Devon and Cornwall Police said three females, two males and the suspect had died in the Keyham area of the city on Thursday evening. One of the dead was a child under 10, according to an MP, but the shooting is not terror-related, police confirmed. The death toll means it is the worst mass shooting in the UK for more than a decade. Emergency services were called to Biddick Drive shortly after 18:00 BST on Thursday. People were told to stay inside and follow police advice as the emergency response developed. Eyewitness Sharron, who lives nearby and did not want to give her full name, said what happened was ""horrendous and so sad"". ""Firstly, there was shouting, followed by gunshots - three possibly four to begin with,"" she said. ""This was when the shooter kicked in the door of a house and randomly started shooting. He ran from the house shooting as he ran and proceeded to shoot at a few people in the linear park up from the drive."" She said the ""shooter proceeded along Royal Navy Avenue still shooting"". Another witness, Robert Pinkerton, said he ""walked around the corner"" and ""bumped into a bloke with a shotgun"". He said the man was dressed all in black. Road closures remained in place overnight after Thursday's shooting In a statement, Devon and Cornwall Police said two females and the three males died at the scene, while one female died shortly after in hospital. It added: ""The area has been cordoned off and police are not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident."" Plymouth Sutton & Devonport MP Luke Pollard said the incident was ""unspeakably awful"" and that he was ""utterly devastated"" to learn one of those killed was a child. The last mass shooting in Britainhappened in 2010when taxi driver Derrick Bird killed 12 people in Cumbria. Police said two females and three males died at the scene Scenes of crime officers in white suits could be seen using cameras in the street and members of the public who lived locally were not allowed into their homes, PA Media reported. Officers appealed to the public not to speculate or share pictures of the scene on social media or anywhere else. Home Secretary Priti Pateltweeted,external: ""The incident in Plymouth is shocking and my thoughts are with those affected. ""I have spoken to the chief constable and offered my full support. ""I urge everyone to remain calm, follow police advice and allow our emergency services to get on with their jobs."" Multiple air ambulances attended the scene, including from Devon and Cornwall Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer tweeted: ""There's much we don't know about the shocking events in Plymouth. However it's clear tragedy has hit Keyham. ""My thoughts are with the families and neighbours of those caught up in this nightmare. I pay tribute to our emergency services who ran towards events we'd all run from.""

"Lee has served 18 months of a revised 30 month sentence Samsung heir Lee Jae-yong has been released from a South Korean prison and is now on parole. He served 207 days in jail - just over half the sentence he received after being convicted of bribery and embezzlement in January. The case involved the country's former President Park Guen-hye, who is also in jail for bribery and corruption. Samsung Electronics was founded by Lee's grandfather and he has been the de facto head since 2014 . Lee made a brief statement to reporters outside the prison. ""I've caused much concern for the people. I deeply apologise,"" Lee said. ""I am listening to the concerns, criticisms, worries and high expectations for me. I will work hard."" The 53-year old was sent to prison for two-and-a-half years by a high court in January. He was accused of paying 43bn won ($37.7m; Â£26.7m) to two non-profit foundations operated by Choi Soon-sil, a friend of Park's, in exchange for political support - alleged to include backing for a controversial Samsung merger which paved the way for Lee to become eventual head of the conglomerate. The deal needed support from the government-run national pension fund. At the time of his verdict, the court said that Lee ""actively provided bribes and implicitly asked the president to use her power to help his smooth succession"" at the head of Samsung. The court found Lee guilty of bribery, embezzlement and concealment of criminal proceeds worth about 8.6 billion won ($7.8m; Â£5.75m). The Justice Ministry said it made the decision to release Lee after considering the effects of the pandemic on South Korea's economy and global markets. In a statement, President Moon Jae-in's office said his release was made in the national interest and asked for understanding. ""We are well aware that there are supporting and opposing views on Vice-Chairman Jay Y Lee's parole. The views of the people who are opposed are also right,"" it said. ""On the other hand, there have been many people who called for his parole in this severe crisis, hoping that he will help the country with respect to semiconductors and vaccines."" However, Lee's parole conditions include five years of business restrictions - it is unclear if he will be able to run the company unless he gets an exemption. He will also need approval for any trips abroad. Lee is also under investigation for fraud and stock manipulation and if found guilty could be jailed again. This appears to be an economic decision by South Korea's Justice Ministry. Free the Samsung heir and aid the country's Covid recovery. But it comes at a political cost. President Moon Jae-in came to power with a firm promise to break the link between big business and government. Millions protested for months to impeach his predecessor Park Geun-hye and more than one thousand civic groups related to these protests wrote a letter asking for the so-called ""Crown Prince of Samsung"" not to be pardoned. But pressure to free Jay Y Lee came from the US Chamber of Commerce alongside Samsung. American businesses argued that his release was vital to help combat a shortfall of computer chips. Samsung is currently mulling multi-billion dollar investments in semiconductor facilities in the US. It's also worth noting that earlier this year the law was changed to allow prisoners to be considered for parole after serving 60% of their sentence. That allowed Mr Lee to be released today. He has not been granted a pardon. But, as we head full swing into presidential election season here in South Korea, the calculation being made by the current administration is that voters will reward the ruling party for its economic decisions more than if it stuck to its previous promises.

"A first glimpse of the new Lord of the Rings TV series Production of the new Lord of the Rings television series will move to the UK from New Zealand, Amazon Studios has confirmed. The as-yet-untitled fantasy epic is set thousands of years before the events in JRR Tolkien's books The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. It is a major blow for New Zealand's entertainment industry where the award-winning movies were also filmed. UK culture secretary Oliver Dowden welcomed the decision. He said: ""Thousands of high quality jobs all across the UK will be created and supported by The Lord of the Rings television series so this is very exciting news."" The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport and the Treasury have been approached for comment on whether Amazon Studios has been offered financial subsidies to move production to the UK. The Hobbit: How England inspired Tolkien's Middle Earth Amazon Studios, the film and TV arm of the technology giant, has already spent $465m (Â£336.5m) on the first season of the show. It said the shift in locations was part of a plan to expand its production space and consolidate its footprint in the UK. The first season of the show will finish filming in New Zealand and will be shown on Amazon Prime in September 2022. Production will then move to the UK and four more seasons of the show are expected to be made. New Zealand's economic development minister Stuart Nash said the government was ""disappointed"" by the decision. In April, the New Zealand government had granted Amazon Studios extra subsidies on its production. Amazon was already receiving a 20% rebate on its expenses for filming The Lord of the Ring series in New Zealand before the government added an extra 5%. At the time, Mr Nash said the agreement with Amazon generated ""local jobs and creates work for local businesses"" and would ""enable a new wave of international tourism branding and promotion for this country"". Commenting on the decision to move production from New Zealand, Mr Nash said the country's film industry was ""incredibly competitive and highly mobile"". ""We have no regrets about giving this production our best shot with government support,"" he said. Amazon said it would not ""actively pursue"" the additional 5% subsidy it had been granted. The Lord of the Rings trilogy, starring Elijah Wood and Sean Astin, was filmed in New Zealand Vernon Sanders, vice president and co-head of TV at Amazon Studios thanked ""the people and the government of New Zealand for their hospitality and dedication and for providing The Lord of the Rings series with an incredible place to begin this epic journey."" New Zealand's dramatic landscapes were also home to Oscar-winning director Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit movie trilogies. The first Lord of the Rings film, The Fellowship of the Ring, was released in December 2001 and the final part of the trilogy was screened in 2003. The popularity of the films helped promote New Zealand's tourist industry. Between 2001 and 2006, annual tourists to the country rose by 40% from 1.7 million to 2.4 million,according to a report,external.

"Directors at UK inhaler company Vectura have recommended shareholders accept a Â£1bn bid from tobacco giant Philip Morris International (PMI). The Marlboro cigarette maker's offer of Â£1.65 per share beat a rival bid from US private equity group Carlyle, whose final offer was Â£1.55 per share. Vectura makes inhaled medicines and devices to treat respiratory illnesses such as asthma. Dozens of health groups had urged Vectura to reject the firm's offer. No auction showdown in battle to buy asthma firm Tobacco giant raises bid for respiratory drugmaker The health groups warned that the deal would significantly harm the future prospects of the healthcare company, as it will deter top lung researchers and scientists unwilling to work for a tobacco company. Shares in Vectura, which counts Novartis and GSK among its customers, have soared 33% in value since Carlyle's first offer in May. Philip Morris recently said itcould stop selling cigarettes in the UK in 10 years' time as it focuses on alternatives, such as heated tobacco. The firm indicated it would welcome a government ban on cigarettes and said ""strong regulation"" was needed to ""help solve the problem of cigarette smoking once and for all"". However, health charity Ash said it was hard to take such claims seriously from the firm responsible for selling over a tenth of cigarettes globally. Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: ""Philip Morris's attempted takeover of a key player in lung health products beggars belief. It is bitterly disappointing that Vectura have so far failed to exercise duty of care to patients and scientists and reject this takeover by big tobacco. ""This is now a test for Sajid Javid. When we know smoking causes so much serious illness and premature death, it's time this government takes the right course, stands up to this tobacco giant and blocks this takeover."" Sources close to the deal tell me the company feels their primary duty is to shareholders and note that PMI must be allowed a chance to transition to its stated goal of deriving half its revenue from non tobacco products within a decade. Some have also questioned whether this deal is any different in principle from oil and gas companies investing in renewable energy. However, this decision will be treated with dismay by health groups and will disappoint many shareholder groups who hoped this deal be an acid test of whether shareholders really prized wider societal goals over getting the best price. PMI will need to convince 51% of shareholders to take the money for it to take control. Many other shareholders may feel uncomfortable being a minority shareholder in a tobacco company subsidiary. A letter sent by more than 20 UK, US and European health organisations on Thursday had urged Vectura's board to ""put sustainability and ethics first"". The signatories included the bosses of Asthma UK, the British Lung Foundation, the Royal Society for Public Health and the Royal College of Physicians, as well as public health directors of several councils and some distinguished medical professors from King's College, Imperial College and University College London (UCL). ""If PMI were to acquire Vectura, PMI could then profit from treating the very illnesses that its products cause,"" they wrote. One of the health groups' key concerns is that Vectura's research links with various universities and hospitals could be compromised. The signatories warned that Vectura could be blocked from participating in clinical trials, thus ""disrupting crucial drug development"". They added that professional partnerships could also be affected, since Vectura won the most contracts in 2020 to develop treatments for respiratory disease and lung cancer. The takeover battle began in May with a Â£958m bid from Carlyle, which received early backing from Vectura's board. But on 8 August, Philip Morris increased its offer to Â£1.65 per share, which totalled a bid of about Â£1.02bn ($1.41bn) from the Marlboro cigarette-maker. London-listed shares of Vectura closed at Â£1.63 on Thursday after hitting a more than five-year high of Â£1.76 pence on Tuesday.
