"The David Hume Institute said past policy had not successfully targeted Scots who settled elsewhere A public policy think tank said a campaign was needed to target ""wealthy, highly skilled"" Scots living in places such as London to return. The David Hume Institute believed the move was necessary to combat Scotland's shrinking working-age population. Its director Jane-Frances Kelly said politicians needed to ""get to grips"" with the looming ""demographic crisis"". The Scottish government insisted the country needed ""tailored immigration solutions"". In its report,external, the institute - which is independent, non-partisan and conducts research aimed at aiding the formation of public policy - highlighted that by 2041 the working-age population of Scotland would rise by only 38,000. In contrast, the number of people of pension age was expected to increase by 265,000 over the same period. Its researchers made a number of recommendations, which included; attracting more workers from the rest of the UK, including those from the Scottish diaspora an immigration system that takes into account ""different needs in different parts of the UK"" a system targeting both high and low skilled migrants and politicians at both Scottish and UK levels ""engaging constructively with meaningful proposals"" The institute said the working-age population crisis could be made worse by the UK's exit from the EU. Ms Kelly said: ""We are sounding a warning signal for Scotland's politicians and policymakers. We need to get to grips with the coming demographic crisis or Scotland's economy will be severely affected. ""There is a compelling case for the Scottish government to be able to adjust immigration to meet Scotland's unique challenge."" She added: ""Our research shows how important increasing immigration will be to sustain the health of the Scottish economy. ""This means not just ensuring that existing migrants stay, but actively encouraging people to come to Scotland to live and work, including from the rest of the UK.""  5,440,000Number of residents in 2019 31%Rise in over 75s since 1998 28%Rise in those aged 65-74 8%Decline in under 15s The report said that the Scottish diaspora was often wealthy, highly-skilled and ""suited to many of the roles that Scotland needs to prosper"". However, it suggested that Scotland had not successfully cultivated this group of workers, ""even though many of them are in London - less than 400 miles from the Scottish border"". The institute identified campaigns in Ireland, Australia and News Zealand where emigrants had been encouraged to return. It highlighted the Irish marketing move by explaining: ""In the 1990s, Ireland managed to reverse its pattern of net emigration by targeting Irish emigrants and their children. People returning home at Christmas and Easter vacations were welcomed with an invite to 'give Ireland a second chance'."" Foreign workers in Scotland fall by 21,000 Scotland's spring birth rate hits record low Scotland's population rises for ninth year Europe and Migration minister Ben Macpherson welcomed the think tank's work on the issue and its recognition that Scotland needed to be able to ""set its own migration policy"". He added: ""People who've settled in Scotland from elsewhere in the EU significantly enrich our society and make a huge contribution to Scotland's economy and public services. They're our friends, neighbours and colleagues and we really want them to stay. ""In addition, as this report makes clear, we need to make it easier for talented hard working migrants to settle in Scotland and contribute to our economy and society.""

"Nigel Benn will fight Sakio Bika in Birmingham on 23 November Former world champion Nigel Benn likened himself to Benjamin Button as he confirmed he will come out of retirement at the age of 55. Briton Benn, who last fought in 1996, said the bout with ex-world champion Sakio Bika in Birmingham on 23 November will give him ""closure"". ""I feel the time is right now. It's nothing to do with age,"" Benn said. But ex-world champion Richie Woodhall told BBC Sport: ""I fear for him. I really hope it doesn't come around."" ""When I was boxing, you don't really realise but you seem to be tense, stiff, hard, and punches bounce off you. You become immune to punches. The 51-year-old added: ""I keep fit and work out on the bag twice a week, doing 10 rounds a session no problem at all. ""I can work at a high pace but I am so soft, I couldn't take a punch off anyone."" Asked if he could withstand the kind of punches now that he felt when winning the world super-middleweight title in 1998, Woodhall told the 5 Live Boxing Podcast: ""Absolutely no way. ""That is what I worry about with Nigel more than anything. He may feel he can take the shots but when you get in the ring with 10oz gloves and you're hit, it's serious stuff."" BBC Radio 5 Live boxing analyst Steve Bunce said a 23-year break after a career before returning to the sport made for ""dreadful cocktail"". Benn has supported his undefeated son Conor at ringside in recent years Benn won the middleweight and super-middleweight world titles during a career in which he won 42, lost five and drew one of his 48 fights. Promoter Frank Warren and current world super-middleweight champion Billy Joe Saunders have criticised Benn's decision to come out of retirement. But at a London news conference, Benn - nicknamed the 'Dark Destroyer' during his career - likened himself to the fictional Hollywood film character who got younger with age. ""It's not the 'Dark Destroyer' because everything synonymous with that name is not who I am,"" Benn said. ""Now it's Nigel 'Benjamin Button' Benn - the older I get, the fitter I am and I 100% mean that. I am so fit. ""It's been a long time coming. This fight is all about me. It wasn't financial; it was always about closure that I wanted that I never had. ""I suffered with a lot of issues in my life from a young age, from 1972 when my brother died - the murder of my brother - which I carried through to my adult life. ""At the age of eight, I started smoking cigarettes to 41, I started doing ecstasy, smoking spliffs all throughout my career, but suffered with depression. ""There's not one fight that I went through that I didn't suffer with. It was bugging me. I don't event think I was at my best, I don't know how I got that far."" The fight with 40-year-old Australian Bika will be licensed by the British and Irish Boxing Authority (BIBA), rather than the British Boxing Board of Control (BBBofC). A BIBA doctor said Benn was fit to fight and that tests show his physiological age is ""at least 15 years younger"" than his actual age.

"Floral tributes have been placed at the scene A girl who was run over in what police have described as a hit-and-run crash has died in hospital. The 10-year-old was struck on Hillsview Avenue in Kenton at about 18:40 GMT on Wednesday, by a Renault Kangoo that was abandoned nearby. Northumbria Police said a 23-year-old man, believed to be the driver, had now been arrested. A second 23-year-old man has also been detained on suspicion of assisting an offender. Two women, aged 31 and 28, were earlier arrested on suspicion of perverting the course of justice. Ch Insp Chris Grice said: ""This is a horrific incident that has robbed a family of their little girl and has had a significant impact on members of the community in Kenton. ""We know this has had a big impact on the community but we know that the public will rally together at this difficult time to support the victim's family.""

"This video can not be played Intel chief questioned on accusations whistleblower is a ""political hack"" Senior White House officials tried to ""lock down"" all details of a phone call between Donald Trump and the Ukrainian president, according to a whistleblower complaint against the US president. In the call, Mr Trump pushed Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate his leading domestic political rival, Joe Biden. Thenewly released complaint,externalsays the call transcript was not stored in the usual computer system. Instead it was stored in a separate system used for classified information. Nancy Pelosi, the most senior Democrat, announced on Tuesday that the party was pushing ahead with a formal impeachment inquiry against the Republican president. She accused Mr Trump of seeking foreign help in the hope of smearing Mr Biden - who is seeking the Democratic nomination for the 2020 presidential election - and of using military aid to Ukraine as a bargaining tool. As it happened: US intel director grilled by Congress What's the Trump-Ukraine story about? How easy is it to impeach a president? Mr Trump acknowledged that he personally blocked nearly $400m in military aid to Ukraine days before he spoke to Mr Zelensky, but denied that it was to pressure the Ukrainian leader into investigating Mr Biden. The release of the whistleblower complaint came as US lawmakers on the House of Representatives intelligence committee began to question President Trump's top intelligence official on the issue. Acting National Intelligence Director Joseph Maguire had initially refused to share the complaint with Congress. But under questioning by the House committee on Thursday, Mr Maguire said he believed the whistleblower had acted in ""good faith"" and ""did the right thing"". President Trump has dismissed the impeachment proceedings as a ""hoax"" and ""another witch-hunt"". This video can not be played What we know about Biden-Ukraine corruption claims Speaking to reporters at the White House on Thursday after the release of the whistleblower's report and the congressional hearing, he said the impeachment process ""shouldn't be allowed"". ""What... Democrats are doing to this country is a disgrace and it shouldn't be allowed,"" he said. ""There should be a way of stopping it, maybe legally through the courts."" Recordings of Mr Trump's comments to staff at the US mission in New York on Wednesday have emerged in which Mr Trump says that whoever gave the whistleblower information is ""almost a spy"". In an apparent reference to the execution of spies by the US in the past, he adds: ""You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? The spies and treason, we used to handle it a little differently than we do now..."" The whistleblower's complaint accuses Mr Trump of ""using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the US 2020 election"". The now unclassified document characterises the president's conduct as a ""serious or flagrant problem, abuse, or violation of law"". This video can not be played Did Trump ask for ""a favour"" in return for aid to Ukraine? The alleged violation concerns President Trump asking his Ukrainian counterpart on 25 July to investigate unfounded allegations against Mr Biden. The whistleblower says in the complaint that they had learned from several sources that senior White House officials had intervened to ""lock down"" all records of the call, particularly an official word-for-word transcript. ""This set of actions underscored to me that White House officials understood the gravity of what had transpired in the call,"" the whistleblower wrote in the complaint. What Trump's Ukraine phone call really means Trump call could embarrass Ukraine's president The whistleblower says details of the call were stored in a ""stand-alone computer system reserved for codeword-level intelligence information, such as covert action"". The whistleblower adds that officials said it was ""'not the first time' under this administration that a presidential transcript was placed into this codeword-level system solely for the purpose of protecting politically sensitive - rather than national security sensitive - information"". The complaint makes clear that the whistleblower was ""not a direct witness"" to most of the events described, but found their colleagues' accounts to be credible ""because, in almost all cases, multiple officials recounted fact patterns that were consistent with one another"". The House intelligence committee chairman Adam Schiff,  a Democrat, opened the hearing by accusing President Trump of a ""classic organised crime shakedown"". But the leading Republican on the committee, Devin Nunes, a Trump supporter, said: ""I want to congratulate the Democrats on their latest informational warfare operation against the president and their extraordinary ability to once again enlist the mainstream media in their campaign."" This video can not be played US citizens react to the latest developments Mr Schiff asked Mr Maguire why he had sought advice from the White House before deciding to release the whistleblower's report. ""It just seemed prudent to check,"" Mr Maguire responded, saying he had sought the advice of White House counsel to determine if the report included information protected by presidential executive privilege. He added: ""I believe everything in this matter is totally unprecedented."" During further questioning by Mr Schiff, Mr Maguire said he believed the whistleblower had acted in ""good faith"". He continued: ""I think the whistleblower did the right thing. I think he followed the law every step of the way."" Donald Trump's presidency has been punctuated by high-profile congressional hearings - Joseph Maguire's is just the latest. As is tradition, both sides tried to draw the witness into giving them ammunition in the ongoing political battles. Democrats wanted him to vouch for the whistleblower's credibility, to detail what they see as a White House cover-up and condemn an administration's Ukraine policy being largely run by a private citizen - Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani. Republicans' ongoing goal was to paint the whole thing as the latest example of ""presidential harassment"". The politicians wanted conclusions, but Maguire mostly spoke of process. ""I have to work with the situation as it is,"" he said at one point. And it's one heck of a situation he's stepped into. During the call, Mr Trump discussed with newly elected Mr Zelensky the 2016 removal of a Ukrainian prosecutor, Viktor Shokin. He then went on to discuss Mr Biden's son, Hunter Biden, and the unsubstantiated allegation that Mr Biden - then the US vice-president - stopped the prosecution of his son by lobbying Ukraine to fire Mr Shokin. Mr Shokin's office had opened an investigation into Burisma, a natural gas company on which Hunter Biden was a board member. During the call, Mr Trump also asked Mr Zelensky to work with US Attorney General William Barr and Mr Trump's personal lawyer, Rudolph Giuliani, to look into the matter. There is no evidence of any wrongdoing by the Bidens. Mr Biden, along with other Western officials, had called for Mr Shokin to be fired because of the perception that he was soft on corruption. When Mr Shokin was replaced, his successor continued to investigate Burisma for 10 months before the inquiry ended. The Department of Justice said on Wednesday that Mr Trump had not spoken to the attorney general about having Ukraine investigate Mr Biden, and Mr Barr had not communicated with Ukraine. On or before 18 July - President Trump orders White House aide to hold back almost $400m in military aid to Ukraine, report US media 25 July - President Trump speaks to Ukraine's leader in a 30-minute phone call 9 September - Congress learns of a whistleblower's complaint about the call, but is blocked by the Trump administration from viewing it 11 September - Military aid for Ukraine is cleared for release by the Pentagon and Department of State 23 September - Mr Trump confirms he withheld Ukrainian aid, saying it was due to concerns about ""corruption"" 24 September - Mr Trump says the aid was withheld so that other countries would pay more.

"There has been a huge police presence at recent parades Glasgow City Council has said it cannot go ahead with a temporary ban on loyalist and republican marches because there is currently ""no legal basis"".

"More than 900 species of animals, insects and plants have been recorded in the Pentland Hills, on the outskirts of Edinburgh, which is predominantly sheep farms Many species and habitats will be lost if a lot more trees are planted in a bid to reverse climate change, a natural heritage officer has warned. Victor Partridge, who looks after the Pentland Hills, said we must be careful not to destroy important habitats that have formed since deforestation in Scotland thousands of years ago. He said many species now thrived in the open space of moors and farmland. He said 97 insect species alone have been recorded in the Pentland Hills. In total, more than 900 species of animals, insects and plants have been recorded in the upland area, on the outskirts of Edinburgh, which is predominantly sheep farms. Ground nesting birds, stoats, weasels, cuckoos, long eared owls, short eared owls are all found in the Pentlands, which is about 20 miles (32 km) in length, and runs south west from Edinburgh towards Biggar and the upper Clydesdale. These animals require open space to hunt and nest. Short-eared owls need open areas to hunt Early farming in Scotland was recorded 3,900 years ago. In many areas settlers burned the heath and resinous pinewoods to encourage fresh growth of heather for their stock. The combination of burning and grazing forced woodland to retreat and prevented it recolonising bare areas. Mr Partridge, City of Edinburgh Council's natural heritage officer, said: ""Humans created different habitats through deforestation and farming and this has led to more diversity for different species. ""There is the suggestion that we can help the planet by planting more trees but we must be very careful where we plant them so we don't lose important habitats. ""Planting some trees is good but we must be careful not to destroy the habitats we have created."" He added: ""Instead we need to change our whole behaviour and stop using fossil fuels."" His comments came as two rare dung beetles, Bradycellus caucasicus, Aphodius fasciatus and two species of butterfly, Small Skipper and Northern Brown Argus, were recorded for the first time in the Pentland Hills. Aphodius fasciatus has just been discovered in the Pentland Hills Mary Church, Friends of the Earth Scotland head of campaigns, said: ""Scotland needs a landscape-scale programme of ecological restoration, repairing peatlands, natural habitats and planting millions of trees, to respond to the interlinked crisis of climate change and biodiversity collapse. ""Obviously reforesting schemes must be sited sensitively with in relation to existing wildlife and ecosystems. ""To tackle the climate emergency, we need systemic changes to our society that will create a healthier, greener country. ""This includes changes to how we travel around, how we heat and power our homes and how we grow food."" She added: ""It means rapidly transitioning away from fossil fuels in a way that protects communities and workers currently dependent on these industries."" Latest forestry statistics show 18.7% of Scotland is forested. The Scottish government's target is for 21% cover by 2032.

"This video can not be played Some of the key moments in Jacques Chirac's career Jacques Chirac, the former French president who championed the European Union, but whose later years were blighted by corruption scandals, has died aged 86. ""President Jacques Chirac died this morning surrounded by his family, peacefully,"" his son-in-law told AFP. Chirac served two terms as president and twice as PM, and took France into the single European currency. French President Emmanuel Macron hailed Chirac as a ""great Frenchman"". The French National Assembly observed a minute's silence in his memory. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

A towering figure in French politics for five decades, Chirac will be remembered for his opposition to the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, his pragmatic statesmanship and his advocacy of the European Union. In a televised address from the Elysee Palace, Mr Macron mourned his death, calling him a president who ""embodied a certain idea of France"". ""We French have lost a statesman whom we loved as much as he loved us,"" Mr Macron said. ""Whether we share, or not, his ideas or what he fought for, we all recognise ourselves in this man who resembled us, and brought us together."" Mr Macron's office said a national day of mourning will take place on Monday, when a mass at the Saint-Sulpice church in Paris will be held. On Thursday night, the illuminations at the Eiffel Tower will be switched off two hours earlier than usual in honour of Chirac, a former Paris mayor. Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission and former Luxembourg prime minister, said he was ""moved and devastated"" to learn the news. ""Europe is not only losing a great statesman, but the president is losing a great friend,"" he said in a statement. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she was ""very sad"" to hear about the death of Chirac, who she described as an ""outstanding partner and friend"". Allow Twitter content?

Another former French President, Nicolas Sarkozy, said on learning the news: ""A part of my life has disappeared today"", adding that Chirac ""embodied a France faithful to its universal values"". A known admirer of Chirac, Russian President Vladimir Putin, praised the ""wise and far-sighted statesman"" for his ""intellect and huge knowledge"". British prime ministers past and present were among those to pay their respect, with John Major and Boris Johnson both hailing his political prowess. Obituary: Chirac - a life in French politics French television stations are playing wall-to-wall tributes, and it is moving to be taken back once again to that long epoch in French history when Jacques Chirac was at the centre of it all. There he is as a chisel-chinned prime minister in the 1970s; later in a flared three-piece suit, announcing the creation of his Gaullist party; then as president upbraiding Israeli soldiers in Jerusalem; or glad-handing at the annual farm show in Paris. The years have passed and no-one particularly wants to dwell on the many failings of the man. No mention in the tributes of the corruption and the flip-flops. What remains for most is the memory of a likeable man, a man of culture (at least that was the image he cultivated), and a president who acted like a French president is supposed to - that is, projecting the permanent conviction that France, of course, is the best place in the world. Read more of Hugh Schofield on Jacques Chirac's legacy Chirac won domestic and international plaudits for his fierce opposition to French involvement in the Iraq War, presciently warning it would prove a ""nightmare"". ""War is always a last resort. It is always proof of failure,"" Chirac said, in comments days before the war started. In 1995, Chirac became the first French leader to recognise the country's role in the deportation of Jews to death camps during World War Two. After winning the 1995 presidential election on a platform of healing the ""social rift"", his promised economic reforms were considered piecemeal. Among his major domestic political reforms was a reduction of the presidential term of office from seven to five years, and the abolition of compulsory military service. Chirac, pictured here with former President Francois Hollande, was staunchly opposed to the Iraq War Described by some as a political chameleon, by others as the ""bulldozer"", Chirac was seen as a leader who could bridge the gap between left and right. As president, he pressed for a more federal Europe within the European Union. In the 2000s, Chirac championed the European project and an EU constitution, which was later rejected in a poll by the majority of French voters. Born in 1932, Chirac was the son of a bank manager. A graduate of Harvard University, he began his career as a high-level civil servant before entering politics. He served as head of state from 1995 to 2007 - making him France's second longest serving post-war president after his immediate Socialist predecessor Francois Mitterrand. Chirac, pictured here in 2006, was an enthusiastic champion of the European Union Chirac's health steadily deteriorated after he stepped down until his death on Thursday. In 2005, he suffered a stroke, and in 2014 his wife Bernadette said he would no longer speak in public, noting he had memory trouble. Chirac also served as French prime minister twice, from 1974 to 1976 and from 1986 to 1988. Chirac was beset by a series of corruption scandals dating back to his tenure as the mayor of Paris between 1977 and 1995. He and his entourage were accused of using city funds to pay for his political party, the RPR. A ruling by the country's constitutional council in 1999 gave the president blanket immunity from prosecution while in office. But in 2011 he was convicted of diverting public funds while serving as mayor, a ruling Chirac rejected. He was found guilty and given a suspended sentence of two years, but remained popular despite his conviction.

Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent The day after the night before, there is still boiling anger here. A place where long standing conventions and courtesies now appear threadbare. Tonight, though, an apparent element of contrition from the prime minister. Boris Johnson hasn't made the apology many MPs are calling for,
but he has told the BBC ""tempers need to come down."" He is, however,
refusing to back down in describing the law designed to prevent a no deal
Brexit next month as the ""surrender act"". He believes it is an accurate
description, as it has made negotiating with the European Union harder. Mr
Johnson added that he was ""deeply sorry"" for the threats MPs have
faced.  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies.

House of CommonsParliament The Commons has adjourned for the day. It will return next week on Monday at 14:30. Cross-party leaders aiming to ward off a no-deal Brexit have held talks about how to ensure the prime minister does not ignore new legislation by refusing to ask the EU for an extension. Jeremy Corbyn spoke with the SNP's Ian Blackford, the Lib Dems' Jo Swinson, the Independent Group for Change's Anna Soubry and Plaid Cymru's Liz Saville-Roberts about the Brexit extension law - or the Benn Act - that was pushed through Parliament earlier this month. Ms Swinson left the talks early to speak to police about a threat made against one of her young children. After the talks Ms Saville-Roberts said: ""We have got to get the Benn Act extension and we have to make sure that actually happens. There are a lot of pressures on, but that overrides everything."" Ms Soubry added: ""We did a pretty good job on the Benn Act, We think we're alright. But the trouble, I'm afraid to say, is that we have a prime minister who you cannot trust."" Politicians should not criticise drill music while using ""violent"" language themselves, a Labour MP says. Shadow cabinet office minister Cat Smith compared the words used by politicians to that of drill artists. Drill has been linked togangs, violence andmurderover the past few years. During a Commons debate on democracy, the MP for Lancaster and Fleetwood said: ""There is a sense of anger shared by many over the criminalisation of their music and the narrative coming from certain parts of the media that drill music is behind the tragic surge in violence."" ""Yet how are we as politicians in any position to accuse drill artists of glorifying violence when politicians themselves are not held responsible for the violent language they use and the impact it has on the culture and climate of debate?"" she said. ""What kind of lesson does this teach our young people?"" she added. BBC's chief political correspondent tweets... Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

House of CommonsParliament Maria Miller says MPs ""faced a perfect storm"" in Parliament yesterday, debating questions ""at the very heart of the principles of democracy"", such as freedom of speech and the rule of law. The Tory MP says both language and behaviour matter in politics. But she says the accusations being levelled at the prime minister were examples of ""inflammatory language accusing others of being inflammatory"", and that is ""as damaging as damaging can be"". ""We must tread carefully"", she says, comparing last's night's debate as ""high politics"" which ""risks people feeling as if they can't speak out"". And she defends the much-repeated phrase used by Boris Johnson - ""the surrender bill"". ""It is not [inflammatory]. It is simply explaining to people who did not... read it word for word,"" she says. ""This is part of the cut and thrust of politics."" Earlier, the Leader of the House, Jacob Rees-Mogg, said he ""assumed"" Boris Johnson would be facing Prime Minister's Questions next Wednesday. He had been due to give his speech to the Tory Party conference, but MPs voted down a recess motion, leaving it in doubt. Now the Huffington Post's executive editor is being told the speech will go ahead in Manchester - even though PMQs is due to start in London at the same time. Where will Mr Johnson be next Wednesday?

"This video can not be played Intel chief questioned on accusations whistleblower is a ""political hack"" Senior White House officials tried to ""lock down"" all details of a phone call between Donald Trump and the Ukrainian president, according to a whistleblower complaint against the US president. In the call, Mr Trump pushed Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate his leading domestic political rival, Joe Biden. Thenewly released complaint,externalsays the call transcript was not stored in the usual computer system. Instead it was stored in a separate system used for classified information. Nancy Pelosi, the most senior Democrat, announced on Tuesday that the party was pushing ahead with a formal impeachment inquiry against the Republican president. She accused Mr Trump of seeking foreign help in the hope of smearing Mr Biden - who is seeking the Democratic nomination for the 2020 presidential election - and of using military aid to Ukraine as a bargaining tool. As it happened: US intel director grilled by Congress What's the Trump-Ukraine story about? How easy is it to impeach a president? Mr Trump acknowledged that he personally blocked nearly $400m in military aid to Ukraine days before he spoke to Mr Zelensky, but denied that it was to pressure the Ukrainian leader into investigating Mr Biden. The release of the whistleblower complaint came as US lawmakers on the House of Representatives intelligence committee began to question President Trump's top intelligence official on the issue. Acting National Intelligence Director Joseph Maguire had initially refused to share the complaint with Congress. But under questioning by the House committee on Thursday, Mr Maguire said he believed the whistleblower had acted in ""good faith"" and ""did the right thing"". President Trump has dismissed the impeachment proceedings as a ""hoax"" and ""another witch-hunt"". This video can not be played What we know about Biden-Ukraine corruption claims Speaking to reporters at the White House on Thursday after the release of the whistleblower's report and the congressional hearing, he said the impeachment process ""shouldn't be allowed"". ""What... Democrats are doing to this country is a disgrace and it shouldn't be allowed,"" he said. ""There should be a way of stopping it, maybe legally through the courts."" Recordings of Mr Trump's comments to staff at the US mission in New York on Wednesday have emerged in which Mr Trump says that whoever gave the whistleblower information is ""almost a spy"". In an apparent reference to the execution of spies by the US in the past, he adds: ""You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? The spies and treason, we used to handle it a little differently than we do now..."" The whistleblower's complaint accuses Mr Trump of ""using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the US 2020 election"". The now unclassified document characterises the president's conduct as a ""serious or flagrant problem, abuse, or violation of law"". This video can not be played Did Trump ask for ""a favour"" in return for aid to Ukraine? The alleged violation concerns President Trump asking his Ukrainian counterpart on 25 July to investigate unfounded allegations against Mr Biden. The whistleblower says in the complaint that they had learned from several sources that senior White House officials had intervened to ""lock down"" all records of the call, particularly an official word-for-word transcript. ""This set of actions underscored to me that White House officials understood the gravity of what had transpired in the call,"" the whistleblower wrote in the complaint. What Trump's Ukraine phone call really means Trump call could embarrass Ukraine's president The whistleblower says details of the call were stored in a ""stand-alone computer system reserved for codeword-level intelligence information, such as covert action"". The whistleblower adds that officials said it was ""'not the first time' under this administration that a presidential transcript was placed into this codeword-level system solely for the purpose of protecting politically sensitive - rather than national security sensitive - information"". The complaint makes clear that the whistleblower was ""not a direct witness"" to most of the events described, but found their colleagues' accounts to be credible ""because, in almost all cases, multiple officials recounted fact patterns that were consistent with one another"". The House intelligence committee chairman Adam Schiff,  a Democrat, opened the hearing by accusing President Trump of a ""classic organised crime shakedown"". But the leading Republican on the committee, Devin Nunes, a Trump supporter, said: ""I want to congratulate the Democrats on their latest informational warfare operation against the president and their extraordinary ability to once again enlist the mainstream media in their campaign."" This video can not be played US citizens react to the latest developments Mr Schiff asked Mr Maguire why he had sought advice from the White House before deciding to release the whistleblower's report. ""It just seemed prudent to check,"" Mr Maguire responded, saying he had sought the advice of White House counsel to determine if the report included information protected by presidential executive privilege. He added: ""I believe everything in this matter is totally unprecedented."" During further questioning by Mr Schiff, Mr Maguire said he believed the whistleblower had acted in ""good faith"". He continued: ""I think the whistleblower did the right thing. I think he followed the law every step of the way."" Donald Trump's presidency has been punctuated by high-profile congressional hearings - Joseph Maguire's is just the latest. As is tradition, both sides tried to draw the witness into giving them ammunition in the ongoing political battles. Democrats wanted him to vouch for the whistleblower's credibility, to detail what they see as a White House cover-up and condemn an administration's Ukraine policy being largely run by a private citizen - Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani. Republicans' ongoing goal was to paint the whole thing as the latest example of ""presidential harassment"". The politicians wanted conclusions, but Maguire mostly spoke of process. ""I have to work with the situation as it is,"" he said at one point. And it's one heck of a situation he's stepped into. During the call, Mr Trump discussed with newly elected Mr Zelensky the 2016 removal of a Ukrainian prosecutor, Viktor Shokin. He then went on to discuss Mr Biden's son, Hunter Biden, and the unsubstantiated allegation that Mr Biden - then the US vice-president - stopped the prosecution of his son by lobbying Ukraine to fire Mr Shokin. Mr Shokin's office had opened an investigation into Burisma, a natural gas company on which Hunter Biden was a board member. During the call, Mr Trump also asked Mr Zelensky to work with US Attorney General William Barr and Mr Trump's personal lawyer, Rudolph Giuliani, to look into the matter. There is no evidence of any wrongdoing by the Bidens. Mr Biden, along with other Western officials, had called for Mr Shokin to be fired because of the perception that he was soft on corruption. When Mr Shokin was replaced, his successor continued to investigate Burisma for 10 months before the inquiry ended. The Department of Justice said on Wednesday that Mr Trump had not spoken to the attorney general about having Ukraine investigate Mr Biden, and Mr Barr had not communicated with Ukraine. On or before 18 July - President Trump orders White House aide to hold back almost $400m in military aid to Ukraine, report US media 25 July - President Trump speaks to Ukraine's leader in a 30-minute phone call 9 September - Congress learns of a whistleblower's complaint about the call, but is blocked by the Trump administration from viewing it 11 September - Military aid for Ukraine is cleared for release by the Pentagon and Department of State 23 September - Mr Trump confirms he withheld Ukrainian aid, saying it was due to concerns about ""corruption"" 24 September - Mr Trump says the aid was withheld so that other countries would pay more.

In 1995, Chirac became the first French leader to recognise the country's role in the deportation of Jews to death camps during World War Two. After winning the 1995 presidential election on a platform of healing the ""social rift"", his promised economic reforms were considered piecemeal. Among his major domestic political reforms was a reduction of the presidential term of office from seven to five years, and the abolition of compulsory military service. Chirac, pictured here with former President Francois Hollande, was staunchly opposed to the Iraq War Described by some as a political chameleon, by others as the ""bulldozer"", Chirac was seen as a leader who could bridge the gap between left and right. As president, he pressed for a more federal Europe within the European Union. In the 2000s, Chirac championed the European project and an EU constitution, which was later rejected in a poll by the majority of French voters. Born in 1932, Chirac was the son of a bank manager. A graduate of Harvard University, he began his career as a high-level civil servant before entering politics. He served as head of state from 1995 to 2007 - making him France's second longest serving post-war president after his immediate Socialist predecessor Francois Mitterrand. Chirac, pictured here in 2006, was an enthusiastic champion of the European Union Chirac's health steadily deteriorated after he stepped down until his death on Thursday. In 2005, he suffered a stroke, and in 2014 his wife Bernadette said he would no longer speak in public, noting he had memory trouble. Chirac also served as French prime minister twice, from 1974 to 1976 and from 1986 to 1988. Chirac was beset by a series of corruption scandals dating back to his tenure as the mayor of Paris between 1977 and 1995. He and his entourage were accused of using city funds to pay for his political party, the RPR. A ruling by the country's constitutional council in 1999 gave the president blanket immunity from prosecution while in office. But in 2011 he was convicted of diverting public funds while serving as mayor, a ruling Chirac rejected. He was found guilty and given a suspended sentence of two years, but remained popular despite his conviction.

"Blackpool's most deprived neighbourhoods include those behind behind its Promenade Eight of the 10 most deprived neighbourhoods in England are in Blackpool, according to new statistics. Seaside village Jaywick, in Essex, has been named the most deprived area overall for the third time in a row since 2010. Blackpool took the next eight slots while Middlesbrough had the largest share of the most deprived areas. Government officials ranked 32,844 neighbourhoods. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) looked at levels of income, employment, education, health and crime as well as housing services and living environment. Jaywick in Essex, near Clacton-on-Sea,was previously found to be the most deprivedin the last two reports in 2010 and 2015. The village, partly made up of a former holiday park, has been visited by the UN special rapporteur for extreme poverty during afact-finding mission to the UK. ""There are no quick fixes"" to the resort's problem, authorities in Blackpool say Among thetop 10 individual neighbourhoods for deprivation,external, Blackpool had eight of them. They include people living on estates just behind its Promenade. Jaywick in Essex has been named as the most deprived neighbourhood in England again Blackpool Pride of Place Partnership - made up of local businesses like Merlin Entertainment, which runs Blackpool Tower, the town's council and other public bodies and voluntary groups - said it recognises ""there are no quick fixes"" to the resort's problems. Paul Smith from the group said: ""We have set out a vision for Blackpool in 2030 that seeks to resolve the town's housing problems, educational outcomes and health challenges with long-term sustainable change. ""While we welcome funding such as the recently announced Stronger Towns Fund or Future High Streets Fund, what Blackpool really needs is a long-term strategic relationship with central government to solve the unique problems that have led to deprivation on this scale."" Can the Happy Club help save Jaywick Sands? The tenth most deprived neighbourhood was Anfield in Liverpool. A number of London boroughs have seen decreases in the proportion of their neighbourhoods that are highly deprived, according to the government, particularly in Tower Hamlets and Westminster. The least deprived area of England is a neighbourhood nestled in the Chiltern Hills near Amersham, Buckinghamshire. Lancaster Gate in Westminster saw the biggest improvement in its ranking since the figures were last updated in 2015. It is now ranked 26,491 out of 32,844 neighbourhoods, compared with 12,101 four years ago. Seven of the 10 neighbourhoods to have seen the biggest improvement were in London. Kingsway in Gloucester, the Whitehall Road area of Leeds and Liverpool city centre were also among the biggest improvers. Jaywick began as a holiday resort, with homes becoming permanent residences after World War Two To Dan Casey, Jaywick is a beautiful coastline and a community of people he loves to talk to. Yet the 80-year-old, who sits as an independent on Tendring Council, is fed up that for the third time in a row his neighbourhood is ranked the most deprived in England. Dan Casey says Jaywick needs investment ""Something has to change or we will be here again in another few years,"" he said. ""It needs investment to bring in jobs. ""The biggest problem here is too many people are relying on benefits."" The latest data shows 57% of people in Jaywick are living in ""income deprivation"", meaning they are either not earning money or earning so little they have to have benefits to support them. He said the economy has suffered ever since Butlin's closed its holiday camp in 1983. ""We've still got a stunning coastline,"" Mr Casey said. ""It's something we have to offer that a lot of other places don't. I was walking here recently, looking out and thinking it's gorgeous. ""I wouldn't want to live anywhere else. I love my home and I love the people."" All of the local authorities with the highest proportion of deprived neighbourhoods are in the north - Middlesbrough, Knowsley, Hull, Liverpool and Manchester. Middlesbrough mayor Andy Preston said: ""The challenges we face are really big and difficult to overcome, but we have big plans that will deliver real progress. ""Within the next three weeks we will be announcing game-changing developments that will help to deliver the economic growth that has been missing for decades."" A government spokesman said: ""The government is committed to levelling across the country and with unemployment levels continuing to fall and wages rising at their fastest in over a decade, we're committed to supporting families with their cost of living. ""We're providing more support to the most deprived authorities, which now have a spending power 16% higher per home than the least deprived."" We asked you what you wanted to know about this story. Here are some of the most popular questions: Each neighbourhood gets a score based on seven different measures. Income deprivation is one of the main ones. It looks at the proportion of the population that is either out of work, or earning a low wage and receiving benefits. Employment deprivation takes account of the working-age population that is out of work. This could be due to unemployment, sickness or disability, or caring responsibilities. The government also looks at the risk of premature death, whether there is a lack of skills, housing availability and the ""living environment"". The last measure looks at things from quality of housing to air quality and road traffic accidents. Overall figures do not show whether things are getting better or worse, just how a neighbourhood compares to others around the country. If a neighbourhood has moved down the rankings, it could mean that the area has become less deprived. However, it could also mean not much has changed for that place, but somewhere else has become more deprived. In an accompanying report, MHCLG said the study revealed ""concentrations of deprivation in large urban conurbations, areas that have historically had large heavy industry manufacturing and/or mining sectors (such as Birmingham, Nottingham, Hartlepool), coastal towns (such as Blackpool or Hastings), and parts of east London"". ""There are also pockets of deprivation surrounded by less deprived places in every region of England,"" it said. The government divides England up into neighbourhoods with a similar population size so that they can be compared with one another. They have an average of about 1,500 residents or 650 households each. UN poverty expert visits deprived village Can the Happy Club help save Jaywick Sands?

"Bury FC, founded in 1885, must now apply to the Football Association for a place in non-league football A proposal for Bury to be readmitted to League Two next season was rejected by the English Football League's 71 member clubs at a meeting on Thursday. Bury, who were in League One, were expelled from the EFL in August after a last-ditch takeover bid collapsed. On Friday, a group trying to rescue Burysubmitted a planfor ""compassionate re-entry"" to League Two. However, an EFL statement said ""it became clear that the proposal did not have the necessary support"". It added that EFL clubs' ""preferred direction of travel"" was ""extending the existing principle of a reduction in relegation across all divisions as a means of returning to 72 clubs now and for the future"". It means only one team will go down from League Two this campaign, rather than two, while three clubs will go down from League One. Maidstone United - the demise and rise of an expelled Football League club 'Football teams are our collective history' Bury expelled from EFL after takeover collapses EFL executive chair Debbie Jevans said: ""While we are saddened that Bury FC is no longer part of the EFL, the board's difficult decision to withdraw membership was only taken after every opportunity to find a resolution was exhausted. ""Since then, in recognition of the efforts made on behalf of the club, the EFL has engaged with supporters' groups, shared their submissions with our members and debated at length the issues raised. ""Following the discussion today, clubs have established that the preferred direction of travel is to reduce relegation from League Two as a means of returning to 72 clubs. ""The clubs felt that, in a difficult situation, this approach maintains fairness for all members and upholds the principle of the football pyramid."" This video can not be played Bury Football Club's fans fight to keep their club alive Two-time FA Cup winners Bury, founded in 1885 and elected to the Football League nine years later, will now have to apply to the Football Association for a place in non-league football. The ""Bury FC Rescue Board"" - backed by local MPs, the Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham and supporters' group Forever Bury - wrote to the EFL to plead for the club's reinstatement, with confirmation of ""active bidders"" and a signed statement from owner Steve Dale pledging to sell the club. Bury North MP James Frith said on Twitter that it was ""devastating to hear self-interest was served cold by many EFL clubs"" at Thursday's meeting. Meanwhile, Burnham told an audience at his monthly Mayor's Question Time that the rescue board will look for Bury to be admitted into the National League next season. At the end of April, Bury were celebrating promotion back to the third tier of English football, but they were already enduring a torrid time off the pitch. The club was already in financial trouble when Dale bought it for Â£1 in December from previous owner Stewart Day, with players and staff often being paid late. A winding-up petition filed against the club was adjourned three times before eventually being dismissed by the High Court on 31 July. By then, creditors had approved a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) put forward by Dale, which was proposed to help settle some of their debts. The CVA meant unsecured creditors, including HM Revenue & Customs, would be paid 25% of the money owed - but also triggered a 12-point deduction in the League One table under EFL rules. However, the EFL were unsatisfied Bury had given enough evidence of their financial viability, leading to a string of postponed fixtures while the organisation awaited ""the clarity required"". On 9 August, the Shakers were given a 14-day deadline to provide the necessary information or face expulsion but they were unable to comply and were expelled from the EFL on 28 August when a takeover bid by C&N Sporting Risk fell through. Also at Thursday's meeting, clubs ""gave their endorsement"" to the proposed appointment of Rick Parry as chairman of the EFL. Former Premier League and Liverpool chief executive Parry was recommended as successor to Ian Lenagan by the EFL board.

"This video can not be played Some of the key moments in Jacques Chirac's career Jacques Chirac, the former French president who championed the European Union, but whose later years were blighted by corruption scandals, has died aged 86. ""President Jacques Chirac died this morning surrounded by his family, peacefully,"" his son-in-law told AFP. Chirac served two terms as president and twice as PM, and took France into the single European currency. French President Emmanuel Macron hailed Chirac as a ""great Frenchman"". The French National Assembly observed a minute's silence in his memory. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

A towering figure in French politics for five decades, Chirac will be remembered for his opposition to the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, his pragmatic statesmanship and his advocacy of the European Union. In a televised address from the Elysee Palace, Mr Macron mourned his death, calling him a president who ""embodied a certain idea of France"". ""We French have lost a statesman whom we loved as much as he loved us,"" Mr Macron said. ""Whether we share, or not, his ideas or what he fought for, we all recognise ourselves in this man who resembled us, and brought us together."" Mr Macron's office said a national day of mourning will take place on Monday, when a mass at the Saint-Sulpice church in Paris will be held. On Thursday night, the illuminations at the Eiffel Tower will be switched off two hours earlier than usual in honour of Chirac, a former Paris mayor. Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission and former Luxembourg prime minister, said he was ""moved and devastated"" to learn the news. ""Europe is not only losing a great statesman, but the president is losing a great friend,"" he said in a statement. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she was ""very sad"" to hear about the death of Chirac, who she described as an ""outstanding partner and friend"". Allow Twitter content?

Former French President FranÃ§ois Hollande also paid homage to Chirac: ""I know that today, the French people, whatever their convictions, have just lost a friend,"" he said in a statement. Another former French President, Nicolas Sarkozy, said on learning the news: ""A part of my life has disappeared today"", adding that Chirac ""embodied a France faithful to its universal values"". A known admirer of Chirac, Russian President Vladimir Putin, praised the ""wise and far-sighted statesman"" for his ""intellect and huge knowledge"". British prime ministers past and present were among those to pay their respect, with John Major and Boris Johnson both hailing his political prowess. Obituary: Chirac - a life in French politics French television stations are playing wall-to-wall tributes, and it is moving to be taken back once again to that long epoch in French history when Jacques Chirac was at the centre of it all. There he is as a chisel-chinned prime minister in the 1970s; later in a flared three-piece suit, announcing the creation of his Gaullist party; then as president upbraiding Israeli soldiers in Jerusalem; or glad-handing at the annual farm show in Paris. The years have passed and no-one particularly wants to dwell on the many failings of the man. No mention in the tributes of the corruption and the flip-flops. What remains for most is the memory of a likeable man, a man of culture (at least that was the image he cultivated), and a president who acted like a French president is supposed to - that is, projecting the permanent conviction that France, of course, is the best place in the world.

"This video can not be played Trump impeachment: Was there a quid pro quo? US lawmakers are preparing to question President Trump's top intelligence official over a whistleblower complaint that sparked an impeachment inquiry. Acting national intelligence director Joseph Maguire initially refused to share the complaint with Congress. It refers to a controversial phone call between Mr Trump and the Ukrainian president, US media report. In the call, Mr Trump pushes Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate corruption claims involving the son of Joe Biden. Mr Biden - the leading Democratic presidential hopeful - says a rough transcript of the conversation released on Wednesday shows the president betrayed his oath of office. Democrats opened an impeachment inquiry against the Republican president on Tuesday, accusing Mr Trump of seeking foreign help in the hope of smearing Mr Biden and of using military aid to Ukraine as a potential bargaining tool. President Trump has dismissed the impeachment proceedings as a ""hoax"" and a ""witch-hunt"". Dissecting phone call behind Trump impeachment push Trump call could embarrass Ukraine's president The whistleblower's formal complaint has now been released. A House of Representatives vote to impeach the president could trigger a trial in the Senate on whether to remove Mr Trump from office. But Republicans control the upper house so it is considered unlikely that a two-thirds majority to dismiss the president could be reached. Congress's investigation focuses partly on whether Mr Trump abused his presidential powers and sought to help his own re-election by seeking the aid of a foreign government to undermine Mr Biden. Mr Trump denies putting pressure on Mr Zelensky. According tonotes of the 25 July phone call,external, President Trump asked his Ukrainian counterpart to look into corruption claims involving the son of Joe Biden, Mr Trump's possible rival in next year's presidential election. There is no evidence of any wrongdoing by the Bidens. This video can not be played Trump: 'It was going to be the call from hell. It turned out to be a nothing call' Mr Trump discusses with newly elected Mr Zelensky the 2016 removal of a prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, according to the notes. He then goes on to discuss Mr Biden's son, Hunter Biden, and the unsubstantiated allegation that Mr Biden stopped the prosecution of his son. On the call, the US president also asks Mr Zelensky to work with US Attorney General William Barr and Mr Trump's personal lawyer, Rudolph Giuliani, to look into the matter, according to the notes. The Department of Justice said on Wednesday that Mr Trump had not spoken to the attorney general about having Ukraine investigate Mr Biden, and Mr Barr had not communicated with Ukraine. Mr Zelensky and Mr Trump met on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York on Wednesday The Ukrainian leader has said he had thought only Mr Trump's side of their phone call would be published. ""I personally think that sometimes such calls between presidents of independent countries should not be published,"" he told Ukrainian media in New York, Reuters news agency reports. Mr Zelensky also said Hunter Biden's case was ""one of many"" he discusses with foreign leaders. ""For me, this is one of numerous cases that I talk about with the leaders of other states, if they ask me,"" he is quoted as saying by the Interfax-Ukraine news agency. ""Sometimes, these cases are being investigated or have not been investigated for many years - I do not know why,"" he added. Mr Trump and his conservative allies have focused on how Mr Biden, as US vice-president in 2016, lobbied Ukraine to fire Mr Shokin. Mr Shokin's office had opened an investigation into Burisma, a natural gas company on which Hunter Biden was a board member. Other Western officials had called for Mr Shokin to be fired because of the perception that he was soft on corruption.

"British Airways owner IAG has warned that its profits will be lower than expected this year, partly due to the impact of strikes by its pilots. It said the strike earlier this month, in a row over pay and conditions, had cost it at least â¬137m (Â£121m). Overall, IAG expects its operating profit for this year to be â¬215m lower than previous guidance. There have been no further talks between BA and the pilots' union, and more strikes will hit profit, IAG said. As a result of the two-day strike by pilots on 9 and 10 September, IAG said a total of 2,325 flights had been cancelled. A strike by BA pilots that had been scheduled for 27 Septemberwas called off last week. BA strike: Why are pilots walking out? In addition to the costs from the pilots' strike, IAG took a â¬33m hit over threatened strikes at Heathrow Airport by employees. The airline group also said its results would include a â¬45m hit from lower bookings and yields - a measure of the average fare per passenger mile - at its low-cost Vueling and Level airlines. IAG also forecast lower growth in capacity - that is, the number of seats available - than it had previously thought, meaning it would reduce pilot recruitment plans. Shares in IAG were among the biggest losers on the FTSE 100 in early trading, dropping about 3.7%, before paring some losses. The British Airline Pilots' Association (Balpa) has said strike action by its members is a ""last resort"" due to ""enormous frustration"" with management. Pilots rejected a pay increase worth 11.5% over three years, which BA proposed in July. Balpa says its members took lower pay rises and made other sacrifices during tougher times for the airline, and now that BA's financial performance has improved - IAG reported a 9% rise in profits last year - they want a greater share of the profits. In a call with analysts, IAG chief executive Willie Walsh said the airline group was interested in slots at Gatwick that may be up for grabs following the collapse of travel firm Thomas Cook. ""If there's an opportunity to acquire some slots through the administration process, we will be looking at that,"" he said. ""We see Gatwick as an opportunity for us."" The 178-year-old holiday firmcollapsed on Mondayafter rescue negotiations failed, triggering the biggest peacetime repatriation to bring 150,000 UK holidaymakers home.

"The introduction of minimum pricing for alcohol in Scotland appears to have cut drinking, a study suggests. Since May 2018, the price of alcohol has had to be at least 50p per unit. The study published in the British Medical Journal looked at how much alcohol was bought in shops before and after the move up to the end of 2018. It found the amount purchased per person per week fell by 1.2 units - the equivalent of just over half a pint of beer or a measure of spirits. The biggest fall was among the heaviest fifth of drinkers - the amount purchased by this group fell by two units. But overall Scots were still buying more than 14 units a week, the recommended limit, after the introduction of the new drinking laws. What is more, the analysis excluded pubs, bars and restaurants, where about a quarter of drinks are purchased. Scotland was the first country in the world to introduce a minimum price based on the strength of alcoholic drinks. Research findings have led to calls for the policy to be adopted across the UK. Wales is looking to introduce minimum pricing in 2020, but neither England nor Northern Ireland currently have plans to set a limit. New drink laws 'implemented effectively' Alcohol price law in Wales delayed to 2020 England 'not tackling alcohol epidemic' Researchers, led by a team at Newcastle University, looked at how much alcohol people were buying in shops and supermarkets, but not in pubs. They analysed the purchasing habits of 60,000 English and Scottish households between 2015 and 2018. Just over 5,000 of them were in Scotland. The English households were used as a control group to measure what would have happened if there had not been a minimum price in Scotland. While households in England increased their consumption slightly, Scottish purchasing fell. The study said overall it represented a fall of 7.6%, or 1.2 units, a week per adult on what would have been expected. The team said that was about twice the impact predicted ahead of the move. Reductions were most noticeable for beer, spirits, and cider, including own-brand spirits and high-strength white ciders. But the team acknowledged there needed to be longer-term follow up to see if the drop was sustained, as there was some evidence that in the later months of 2018 consumption had begun to rise again. Lead researcher Prof Peter Anderson said: ""You would expect some levelling off from the initial impact, but I think the findings are enough to suggest minimum pricing is effective and should be adopted across the UK."" Eric Carlin from the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh, agreed the evidence was compelling, but he said risky alcohol consumption was a ""complex"" public health issue. ""No single policy lever should be seen as a panacea,"" he added. Scottish public health minister Joe Fitzpatrick said the findings were ""very encouraging"".

Jess Phillips Labour MP Jess Phillips, who represents Birmingham Yardley, said a man has been arrested after allegedly attacking her constituency office. West Midlands police said in a statement: ""Police were called to reports of a disturbance outside an address on Yardley Road in Acocks Green, Birmingham just before 14:25 BST this afternoon. ""A 36-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of a public order offence and possession of cannabis. ""Heâs been taken into police custody and will be questioned in due course"".  Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent The day after the night before, there is still boiling anger here. A place where long standing conventions and courtesies now appear threadbare. Tonight, though, an apparent element of contrition from the prime minister. Boris Johnson hasn't made the apology many MPs are calling for,
but he has told the BBC ""tempers need to come down."" He is, however,
refusing to back down in describing the law designed to prevent a no deal
Brexit next month as the ""surrender act"". He believes it is an accurate
description, as it has made negotiating with the European Union harder. Mr
Johnson added that he was ""deeply sorry"" for the threats MPs have
faced.  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies.

House of CommonsParliament The Commons has adjourned for the day. It will return next week on Monday at 14:30. Cross-party leaders aiming to ward off a no-deal Brexit have held talks about how to ensure the prime minister does not ignore new legislation by refusing to ask the EU for an extension. Jeremy Corbyn spoke with the SNP's Ian Blackford, the Lib Dems' Jo Swinson, the Independent Group for Change's Anna Soubry and Plaid Cymru's Liz Saville-Roberts about the Brexit extension law - or the Benn Act - that was pushed through Parliament earlier this month. Ms Swinson left the talks early to speak to police about a threat made against one of her young children. After the talks Ms Saville-Roberts said: ""We have got to get the Benn Act extension and we have to make sure that actually happens. There are a lot of pressures on, but that overrides everything."" Ms Soubry added: ""We did a pretty good job on the Benn Act, We think we're alright. But the trouble, I'm afraid to say, is that we have a prime minister who you cannot trust."" Politicians should not criticise drill music while using ""violent"" language themselves, a Labour MP says. Shadow cabinet office minister Cat Smith compared the words used by politicians to that of drill artists. Drill has been linked togangs, violence andmurderover the past few years. During a Commons debate on democracy, the MP for Lancaster and Fleetwood said: ""There is a sense of anger shared by many over the criminalisation of their music and the narrative coming from certain parts of the media that drill music is behind the tragic surge in violence."" ""Yet how are we as politicians in any position to accuse drill artists of glorifying violence when politicians themselves are not held responsible for the violent language they use and the impact it has on the culture and climate of debate?"" she said. ""What kind of lesson does this teach our young people?"" she added. BBC's chief political correspondent tweets... Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Downing Street sources have said the Tory Party conference will go ahead as planned - even if if it means Boris Johnson has to skip Prime Minister's Questions to give his keynote speech on Wednesday. A source told the Press Association: ""If somebody needs to do PMQs, somebody will do PMQs.""  House of CommonsParliament Maria Miller says MPs ""faced a perfect storm"" in Parliament yesterday, debating questions ""at the very heart of the principles of democracy"", such as freedom of speech and the rule of law. The Tory MP says both language and behaviour matter in politics. But she says the accusations being levelled at the prime minister were examples of ""inflammatory language accusing others of being inflammatory"", and that is ""as damaging as damaging can be"". ""We must tread carefully"", she says, comparing last's night's debate as ""high politics"" which ""risks people feeling as if they can't speak out"". And she defends the much-repeated phrase used by Boris Johnson - ""the surrender bill"". ""It is not [inflammatory]. It is simply explaining to people who did not... read it word for word,"" she says. ""This is part of the cut and thrust of politics."" Earlier, the Leader of the House, Jacob Rees-Mogg, said he ""assumed"" Boris Johnson would be facing Prime Minister's Questions next Wednesday. He had been due to give his speech to the Tory Party conference, but MPs voted down a recess motion, leaving it in doubt. Now the Huffington Post's executive editor is being told the speech will go ahead in Manchester - even though PMQs is due to start in London at the same time. Where will Mr Johnson be next Wednesday?

"More than a quarter of secondary school pupils in England and Wales have received private tuition, according to research published by the Sutton Trust. The highest levels are in London - with 41% of secondary pupils getting extra lessons outside of school, it says. The social-mobility charity is calling for financial support for disadvantaged families to have access to tutoring. ""With costs of at least Â£25 per session, many parents can't afford it,"" said charity founder Sir Peter Lampl. The annual report from the Sutton Trust tracks the prevalence of parents paying for tuition. Such extra lessons have been seen as a hidden factor in exam results - but because of the cost, the charity warns this gives richer families an unfair advantage. Based on evidence from the National Foundation for Educational Research and a survey of almost 3,000 families, the report suggests 27% of 11 to 16-year-olds have had some private tuition while at secondary school. This is higher than the 18% who received tutoring in 2005 but has fallen back on a couple of years ago, when 30% had paid for extra lessons, it says. Poor pupils get less tutoring and help with homework The 'shadow business' of tutors and exam pressure But the use of tutors is skewed towards the affluent, with 34% of better-off families having used tutors compared with 20% of less well-off families. Paying for extra tuition is twice as common in England than Wales - 28% to 14% - and a separate figure for London suggests much higher levels of 41%. Extra help with GCSEs is the most common reason families pay for private tuition, the research suggests The most common reasons given for hiring tutors were helping with a specific GCSE exam and ""schoolwork in general"". The research suggests almost a quarter of classroom teachers in secondary school have worked as private tutors in the past two years, with most of these providing lessons after being asked by parents. The Sutton Trust says there is evidence such individual tutoring can make a positive difference. But it says there needs to be a way of making it available to the disadvantaged, such as providing means-tested vouchers. Trust founder and chairman Sir Peter Lampl said such a scheme would ""enable lower-income families to provide tuition for their children"" in an environment in which ""private tuition is widespread"". Mary Bousted, joint leader of the National Education Union, said such subsidies for tuition could seem appealing but the money would be better spent increasing budgets for underfunded schools or pupil premium funding to support disadvantaged pupils. Labour's annual conference has backed calls to move private schools into the state sector, but a party spokesman said this would not affect private tutoring outside school.

A towering figure in French politics for five decades, Chirac will be remembered for his opposition to the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, his pragmatic statesmanship and his advocacy of the European Union. In a televised address from the Elysee Palace, Mr Macron mourned his death, calling him a president who ""embodied a certain idea of France"". ""We French have lost a statesman whom we loved as much as he loved us,"" Mr Macron said. ""Whether we share, or not, his ideas or what he fought for, we all recognise ourselves in this man who resembled us, and brought us together.""

Obituary: Chirac - a life in French politics French television stations are playing wall-to-wall tributes, and it is moving to be taken back once again to that long epoch in French history when Jacques Chirac was at the centre of it all. There he is as a chisel-chinned prime minister in the 1970s; later in a flared three-piece suit, announcing the creation of his Gaullist party; then as president upbraiding Israeli soldiers in Jerusalem; or glad-handing at the annual farm show in Paris. The years have passed and no-one particularly wants to dwell on the many failings of the man. No mention in the tributes of the corruption and the flip-flops. What remains for most is the memory of a likeable man, a man of culture (at least that was the image he cultivated), and a president who acted like a French president is supposed to - that is, projecting the permanent conviction that France, of course, is the best place in the world. Read more of Hugh Schofield on Jacques Chirac's legacy Chirac won domestic and international plaudits for his fierce opposition to French involvement in the Iraq War, presciently warning it would prove a ""nightmare"". ""War is always a last resort. It is always proof of failure,"" Chirac said, in comments days before the war started. In 1995, Chirac became the first French leader to recognise the country's role in the deportation of Jews to death camps during World War Two. After winning the 1995 presidential election on a platform of healing the ""social rift"", his promised economic reforms were considered piecemeal. Among his major domestic political reforms was a reduction of the presidential term of office from seven to five years, and the abolition of compulsory military service. Chirac, pictured here with former President Francois Hollande, was staunchly opposed to the Iraq War Described by some as a political chameleon, by others as the ""bulldozer"", Chirac was seen as a leader who could bridge the gap between left and right. As president, he pressed for a more federal Europe within the European Union. In the 2000s, Chirac championed the European project and an EU constitution, which was later rejected in a poll by the majority of French voters. Born in 1932, Chirac was the son of a bank manager. A graduate of Harvard University, he began his career as a high-level civil servant before entering politics. He served as head of state from 1995 to 2007 - making him France's second longest serving post-war president after his immediate Socialist predecessor Francois Mitterrand. Chirac, pictured here in 2006, was an enthusiastic champion of the European Union Chirac's health steadily deteriorated after he stepped down until his death on Thursday. In 2005, he suffered a stroke, and in 2014 his wife Bernadette said he would no longer speak in public, noting he had memory trouble. Chirac also served as French prime minister twice, from 1974 to 1976 and from 1986 to 1988. Chirac was beset by a series of corruption scandals dating back to his tenure as the mayor of Paris between 1977 and 1995. He and his entourage were accused of using city funds to pay for his political party, the RPR. A ruling by the country's constitutional council in 1999 gave the president blanket immunity from prosecution while in office. But in 2011 he was convicted of diverting public funds while serving as mayor, a ruling Chirac rejected. He was found guilty and given a suspended sentence of two years, but remained popular despite his conviction.

In 2005, he suffered a stroke, and in 2014 his wife Bernadette said he would no longer speak in public, noting he had memory trouble. Chirac also served as French prime minister twice, from 1974 to 1976 and from 1986 to 1988. Chirac was beset by a series of corruption scandals dating back to his tenure as the mayor of Paris between 1977 and 1995. He and his entourage were accused of using city funds to pay for his political party, the RPR. A ruling by the country's constitutional council in 1999 gave the president blanket immunity from prosecution while in office. But in 2011 he was convicted of diverting public funds while serving as mayor, a ruling Chirac rejected. He was found guilty and given a suspended sentence of two years, but remained popular despite his conviction.

"The introduction of minimum pricing for alcohol in Scotland appears to have cut drinking, a study suggests. Since May 2018, the price of alcohol has had to be at least 50p per unit. The study published in the British Medical Journal looked at how much alcohol was bought in shops before and after the move up to the end of 2018. It found the amount purchased per person per week fell by 1.2 units - the equivalent of just over half a pint of beer or a measure of spirits. The biggest fall was among the heaviest fifth of drinkers - the amount purchased by this group fell by two units. But overall Scots were still buying more than 14 units a week, the recommended limit, after the introduction of the new drinking laws. What is more, the analysis excluded pubs, bars and restaurants, where about a quarter of drinks are purchased. Scotland was the first country in the world to introduce a minimum price based on the strength of alcoholic drinks. Research findings have led to calls for the policy to be adopted across the UK. Wales is looking to introduce minimum pricing in 2020, but neither England nor Northern Ireland currently have plans to set a limit. New drink laws 'implemented effectively' Alcohol price law in Wales delayed to 2020 England 'not tackling alcohol epidemic' Researchers, led by a team at Newcastle University, looked at how much alcohol people were buying in shops and supermarkets, but not in pubs. They analysed the purchasing habits of 60,000 English and Scottish households between 2015 and 2018. Just over 5,000 of them were in Scotland. The English households were used as a control group to measure what would have happened if there had not been a minimum price in Scotland. While households in England increased their consumption slightly, Scottish purchasing fell. The study said overall it represented a fall of 7.6%, or 1.2 units, a week per adult on what would have been expected. The team said that was about twice the impact predicted ahead of the move. Reductions were most noticeable for beer, spirits, and cider, including own-brand spirits and high-strength white ciders. But the team acknowledged there needed to be longer-term follow up to see if the drop was sustained, as there was some evidence that in the later months of 2018 consumption had begun to rise again. Lead researcher Prof Peter Anderson said: ""You would expect some levelling off from the initial impact, but I think the findings are enough to suggest minimum pricing is effective and should be adopted across the UK."" Eric Carlin from the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh, agreed the evidence was compelling, but he said risky alcohol consumption was a ""complex"" public health issue. ""No single policy lever should be seen as a panacea,"" he added. Scottish public health minister Joe Fitzpatrick said the findings were ""very encouraging"".

"British Airways owner IAG has warned that its profits will be lower than expected this year, partly due to the impact of strikes by its pilots. It said the strike earlier this month, in a row over pay and conditions, had cost it at least â¬137m (Â£121m). Overall, IAG expects its operating profit for this year to be â¬215m lower than previous guidance. There have been no further talks between BA and the pilots' union, and more strikes will hit profit, IAG said. As a result of the two-day strike by pilots on 9 and 10 September, IAG said a total of 2,325 flights had been cancelled. A strike by BA pilots that had been scheduled for 27 Septemberwas called off last week. BA strike: Why are pilots walking out? In addition to the costs from the pilots' strike, IAG took a â¬33m hit over threatened strikes at Heathrow Airport by employees. The airline group also said its results would include a â¬45m hit from lower bookings and yields - a measure of the average fare per passenger mile - at its low-cost Vueling and Level airlines. IAG also forecast lower growth in capacity - that is, the number of seats available - than it had previously thought, meaning it would reduce pilot recruitment plans. Shares in IAG were among the biggest losers on the FTSE 100 in early trading, dropping about 3.7%, before paring some losses. The British Airline Pilots' Association (Balpa) has said strike action by its members is a ""last resort"" due to ""enormous frustration"" with management. Pilots rejected a pay increase worth 11.5% over three years, which BA proposed in July. Balpa says its members took lower pay rises and made other sacrifices during tougher times for the airline, and now that BA's financial performance has improved - IAG reported a 9% rise in profits last year - they want a greater share of the profits. In a call with analysts, IAG chief executive Willie Walsh said the airline group was interested in slots at Gatwick that may be up for grabs following the collapse of travel firm Thomas Cook. ""If there's an opportunity to acquire some slots through the administration process, we will be looking at that,"" he said. ""We see Gatwick as an opportunity for us."" The 178-year-old holiday firmcollapsed on Mondayafter rescue negotiations failed, triggering the biggest peacetime repatriation to bring 150,000 UK holidaymakers home.

"This video can not be played Trump impeachment: Was there a quid pro quo? US lawmakers are preparing to question President Trump's top intelligence official over a whistleblower complaint that sparked an impeachment inquiry. Acting national intelligence director Joseph Maguire initially refused to share the complaint with Congress. It refers to a controversial phone call between Mr Trump and the Ukrainian president, US media report. In the call, Mr Trump pushes Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate corruption claims involving the son of Joe Biden. Mr Biden - the leading Democratic presidential hopeful - says a rough transcript of the conversation released on Wednesday shows the president betrayed his oath of office. Democrats opened an impeachment inquiry against the Republican president on Tuesday, accusing Mr Trump of seeking foreign help in the hope of smearing Mr Biden and of using military aid to Ukraine as a potential bargaining tool. President Trump has dismissed the impeachment proceedings as a ""hoax"" and a ""witch-hunt"". Dissecting phone call behind Trump impeachment push Trump call could embarrass Ukraine's president The whistleblower's formal complaint has now been released. A House of Representatives vote to impeach the president could trigger a trial in the Senate on whether to remove Mr Trump from office. But Republicans control the upper house so it is considered unlikely that a two-thirds majority to dismiss the president could be reached. Congress's investigation focuses partly on whether Mr Trump abused his presidential powers and sought to help his own re-election by seeking the aid of a foreign government to undermine Mr Biden. Mr Trump denies putting pressure on Mr Zelensky. According tonotes of the 25 July phone call,external, President Trump asked his Ukrainian counterpart to look into corruption claims involving the son of Joe Biden, Mr Trump's possible rival in next year's presidential election. There is no evidence of any wrongdoing by the Bidens. This video can not be played Trump: 'It was going to be the call from hell. It turned out to be a nothing call' Mr Trump discusses with newly elected Mr Zelensky the 2016 removal of a prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, according to the notes. He then goes on to discuss Mr Biden's son, Hunter Biden, and the unsubstantiated allegation that Mr Biden stopped the prosecution of his son. On the call, the US president also asks Mr Zelensky to work with US Attorney General William Barr and Mr Trump's personal lawyer, Rudolph Giuliani, to look into the matter, according to the notes. The Department of Justice said on Wednesday that Mr Trump had not spoken to the attorney general about having Ukraine investigate Mr Biden, and Mr Barr had not communicated with Ukraine. Mr Zelensky and Mr Trump met on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York on Wednesday The Ukrainian leader has said he had thought only Mr Trump's side of their phone call would be published. ""I personally think that sometimes such calls between presidents of independent countries should not be published,"" he told Ukrainian media in New York, Reuters news agency reports. Mr Zelensky also said Hunter Biden's case was ""one of many"" he discusses with foreign leaders. ""For me, this is one of numerous cases that I talk about with the leaders of other states, if they ask me,"" he is quoted as saying by the Interfax-Ukraine news agency. ""Sometimes, these cases are being investigated or have not been investigated for many years - I do not know why,"" he added. Mr Trump and his conservative allies have focused on how Mr Biden, as US vice-president in 2016, lobbied Ukraine to fire Mr Shokin. Mr Shokin's office had opened an investigation into Burisma, a natural gas company on which Hunter Biden was a board member. Other Western officials had called for Mr Shokin to be fired because of the perception that he was soft on corruption. Mr Biden last year told a foreign policy event how he threatened to withhold $1bn in aid to Ukraine unless Mr Shokin was removed. 18 July - President Trump orders White House aide to hold back almost $400m in military aid to Ukraine, report US media 25 July - President Trump speaks to Ukraine's leader in a 30-minute phone call 9 September - Congress learns of a whistleblower's complaint about the call, but is blocked by the Trump administration from viewing it 11 September - Military aid for Ukraine is cleared for release by the Pentagon and US Department of State 23 September - Trump confirms he withheld Ukrainian aid, saying it was due to concerns about ""corruption"" 24 September - Trump says the aid was withheld so that other countries would pay more What's the Trump-Ukraine story about?

Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent The day after the night before, there is still boiling anger here. A place where long standing conventions and courtesies now appear threadbare. Tonight, though, an apparent element of contrition from the prime minister. Boris Johnson hasn't made the apology many MPs are calling for,
but he has told the BBC ""tempers need to come down."" He is, however,
refusing to back down in describing the law designed to prevent a no deal
Brexit next month as the ""surrender act"". He believes it is an accurate
description, as it has made negotiating with the European Union harder. Mr
Johnson added that he was ""deeply sorry"" for the threats MPs have
faced.  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies.

House of CommonsParliament The Commons has adjourned for the day. It will return next week on Monday at 14:30. Cross-party leaders aiming to ward off a no-deal Brexit have held talks about how to ensure the prime minister does not ignore new legislation by refusing to ask the EU for an extension. Jeremy Corbyn spoke with the SNP's Ian Blackford, the Lib Dems' Jo Swinson, the Independent Group for Change's Anna Soubry and Plaid Cymru's Liz Saville-Roberts about the Brexit extension law - or the Benn Act - that was pushed through Parliament earlier this month. Ms Swinson left the talks early to speak to police about a threat made against one of her young children. After the talks Ms Saville-Roberts said: ""We have got to get the Benn Act extension and we have to make sure that actually happens. There are a lot of pressures on, but that overrides everything."" Ms Soubry added: ""We did a pretty good job on the Benn Act, We think we're alright. But the trouble, I'm afraid to say, is that we have a prime minister who you cannot trust."" Politicians should not criticise drill music while using ""violent"" language themselves, a Labour MP says. Shadow cabinet office minister Cat Smith compared the words used by politicians to that of drill artists. Drill has been linked togangs, violence andmurderover the past few years. During a Commons debate on democracy, the MP for Lancaster and Fleetwood said: ""There is a sense of anger shared by many over the criminalisation of their music and the narrative coming from certain parts of the media that drill music is behind the tragic surge in violence."" ""Yet how are we as politicians in any position to accuse drill artists of glorifying violence when politicians themselves are not held responsible for the violent language they use and the impact it has on the culture and climate of debate?"" she said. ""What kind of lesson does this teach our young people?"" she added. BBC's chief political correspondent tweets... Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

House of CommonsParliament Maria Miller says MPs ""faced a perfect storm"" in Parliament yesterday, debating questions ""at the very heart of the principles of democracy"", such as freedom of speech and the rule of law. The Tory MP says both language and behaviour matter in politics.

""We must tread carefully"", she says, comparing last's night's debate as ""high politics"" which ""risks people feeling as if they can't speak out"". And she defends the much-repeated phrase used by Boris Johnson - ""the surrender bill"". ""It is not [inflammatory]. It is simply explaining to people who did not... read it word for word,"" she says. ""This is part of the cut and thrust of politics."" Earlier, the Leader of the House, Jacob Rees-Mogg, said he ""assumed"" Boris Johnson would be facing Prime Minister's Questions next Wednesday. He had been due to give his speech to the Tory Party conference, but MPs voted down a recess motion, leaving it in doubt.

"In a new Scottish book, 30 characters share the spotlight - they also share the struggle of living with a long-term health condition. Some are fighting physical illness, some are fighting substance abuse and mental health issues. Some aren't suffering, just coping on behalf of a loved one who is. Their stories are featured in a new charity book, Humans of Scotland. It has been put together by the Health and Social Care Alliance, which invited people to share their experiences through a storytelling project. And it has gained the backing of First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who has written the foreword. Former Scotland rugby internationalDoddie Weir, who has Motor Neurone Disease, andFrank's Law campaignerAmanda Kopel are among the familiar faces who feature in the book. But there are many more ""ordinary"" Scots who share their stories. Here is a selection: Michael Byrne from Stepps - survivor of the Clutha disaster Michael Byrne survived the Clutha disaster, but struggled with complex PTSD It was lonely and extremely painful. The loneliness was caused because no one could understand my pain. All you want to do is escape from the pain. You have something you believe no one can relate to. I went off the rails and sabotaged everything around me. Those four to five months were my darkest days. I clung onto life an hour at a time and that's what I've done ever since. I've got a two and a half-year-old. As bad as the pain was, I wanted to forge ahead. When I found out I had complex PTSD I was relieved. I was denying I was ill for a long, long time. It was a freedom to own it. It's me and that's it.  It's taken me 49 years to get to this point. I write poetry, I go to support groups, they are absolutely my medicine. I volunteer from Brothers in Arms Scotland and run a support group and I help out with Stigma Free Lanarkshire. I need some alone time. I need to do a bit of meditation, a bit of writing, it's blocking the outside world out because sometimes I'm noise sensitive, I'm light sensitive. I have to find a balance. I love waking up my son in the morning. It's the most beautiful moment of the day, just lifting him up and giving him a kiss. He's a beautiful boy. I look forward to making a difference to people in the future, even just by telling my story, if they think ""if that guy can do it, I'll go and talk to somebody"". Melanie McLean from Kilmarnock - has rheumatoid arthritis Melanie McLean was angry at her body for letting her down when she became a new mother I found a notebook that contained writing about the challenges, feelings and emotions I had within the first few months of having my baby. On opening the first page, I was transported to a time, not so long ago, where I was furious with my body for letting me down, for letting my baby down. I wroteâ¦ My body is letting me down. At eight months it has become physically impossible to hold her in my arms for more than two minutes at a time. I worry about not being able to be a proper mum as I'm not able to physically keep up as eight months of constant caring, being up, physical activity, the cycle of insomnia and knackeredness is really telling on my body. I have thoughts every night in bed of what I'd love to be able to do with her, but I can't do these things. I am aware of being physically weak and 'unable' for the first time in my life of living with rheumatoid arthritis. I can hardly get the sick drenched clothes off her or me, turn the dial on the shower or wash the sick off me, or dry myself, or get new clothes on, thanking god for my husband who is able to comfort her and clean up the mess.  And I get angry at my body and myself for not being able just to get things done, or deal with my current agony."" I remember that I had stopped writing because I was crying, with defeat in my heart. What I can tell you though, is that I picked up my defeated heart, dusted myself down and somewhere, from very deep within, found my usual defiance, looked ahead and kept on goingâ¦"" Imran Akhtar from Glasgow - suffered sudden sight loss Imran Akhtar lost his sight suddenly but found a new vocation in helping others going through similar experiences I was a post office manager at the time, and I was just standing at work one day and the sight in one eye just went. No warning, no pain, no nothing. I finished my shift and thought it might get better. The next day I went to the hospital and they said my retina had detached. They don't know why it happened. I was going in for my third operation and I noticed a little speck in my other eye. They said that retina has detached as well. I asked when I could get back to driving and they said it's never going to happen. In the waiting room I just started crying. I wasn't prepared for it, I wasn't expecting it. I thought I would just go back to my old life. I went home and stayed in bed for two weeks. Eventually I managed to pick myself up and went to theRNIB,externaland they said they could help me find a job. I started volunteering and eventually a full-time job came up. That came to an end and now I work forAccess to Work,external. I go out and see people with sight loss, hearing loss and dyslexia to offer help, support and advice. I feel like I've come full circle. I'm helping people who were in my position. The most amazing moment is when I'm seeing someone with sight loss and they see my white cane. Their mentality changes when they see somebody with sight loss doing this type of job. When I see the figures for people with disability in work it's heart breaking. They just need a little bit of support. It sounds weird to say, but losing my sight was one of the most positive experiences because now I'm helping people in a real way. Before that I was just plodding along rather than being in this great position. My confidence is sky high. If you're facing sight loss and you are feeling really low, just know there is help and support out there. You have to reach out to people and, I assure you, they will reach back and help you. Humans of Scotland was launched on 25 September and will be available free of charge. It will be distributed across all libraries in Scotland.

"This video can not be played Some of the key moments in Jacques Chirac's career Jacques Chirac, the former French president who championed the European Union, but whose later years were blighted by corruption scandals, has died aged 86. ""President Jacques Chirac died this morning surrounded by his family, peacefully,"" his son-in-law told AFP. Chirac served two terms as president and twice as PM, and took France into the single European currency. French President Emmanuel Macron hailed Chirac as a ""great Frenchman"". The French National Assembly observed a minute's silence in his memory. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

A towering figure in French politics for five decades, Chirac will be remembered for his opposition to the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, his pragmatic statesmanship and his advocacy of the European Union. In a televised address from the Elysee Palace, Mr Macron mourned his death, calling him a president who ""embodied a certain idea of France"". ""We French have lost a statesman whom we loved as much as he loved us,"" Mr Macron said. ""Whether we share, or not, his ideas or what he fought for, we all recognise ourselves in this man who resembled us, and brought us together."" Mr Macron's office said a national day of mourning will take place on Monday, when a mass at the Saint-Sulpice church in Paris will be held. On Thursday night, the illuminations at the Eiffel Tower will be switched off two hours earlier than usual in honour of Chirac, a former Paris mayor. Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission and former Luxembourg prime minister, said he was ""moved and devastated"" to learn the news. ""Europe is not only losing a great statesman, but the president is losing a great friend,"" he said in a statement. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she was ""very sad"" to hear about the death of Chirac, who she described as an ""outstanding partner and friend"". Allow Twitter content?

Former French President FranÃ§ois Hollande also paid homage to Chirac: ""I know that today, the French people, whatever their convictions, have just lost a friend,"" he said in a statement. Another former French President, Nicolas Sarkozy, said on learning the news: ""A part of my life has disappeared today"", adding that Chirac ""embodied a France faithful to its universal values"". A known admirer of Chirac, Russian President Vladimir Putin, praised the ""wise and far-sighted statesman"" for his ""intellect and huge knowledge"". British prime ministers past and present were among those to pay their respect, with John Major and Boris Johnson both hailing his political prowess. Obituary: Chirac - a life in French politics French television stations are playing wall-to-wall tributes, and it is moving to be taken back once again to that long epoch in French history when Jacques Chirac was at the centre of it all. There he is as a chisel-chinned prime minister in the 1970s; later in a flared three-piece suit, announcing the creation of his Gaullist party; then as president upbraiding Israeli soldiers in Jerusalem; or glad-handing at the annual farm show in Paris. The years have passed and no-one particularly wants to dwell on the many failings of the man. No mention in the tributes of the corruption and the flip-flops. What remains for most is the memory of a likeable man, a man of culture (at least that was the image he cultivated), and a president who acted like a French president is supposed to - that is, projecting the permanent conviction that France, of course, is the best place in the world. Read more of Hugh Schofield on Jacques Chirac's legacy Chirac won domestic and international plaudits for his fierce opposition to French involvement in the Iraq War, presciently warning it would prove a ""nightmare"". ""War is always a last resort. It is always proof of failure,"" Chirac said, in comments days before the war started. In 1995, Chirac became the first French leader to recognise the country's role in the deportation of Jews to death camps during World War Two. After winning the 1995 presidential election on a platform of healing the ""social rift"", his promised economic reforms were considered piecemeal. Among his major domestic political reforms was a reduction of the presidential term of office from seven to five years, and the abolition of compulsory military service. Chirac, pictured here with former President Francois Hollande, was staunchly opposed to the Iraq War Described by some as a political chameleon, by others as the ""bulldozer"", Chirac was seen as a leader who could bridge the gap between left and right. As president, he pressed for a more federal Europe within the European Union. In the 2000s, Chirac championed the European project and an EU constitution, which was later rejected in a poll by the majority of French voters. Born in 1932, Chirac was the son of a bank manager. A graduate of Harvard University, he began his career as a high-level civil servant before entering politics. He served as head of state from 1995 to 2007 - making him France's second longest serving post-war president after his immediate Socialist predecessor Francois Mitterrand. Chirac, pictured here in 2006, was an enthusiastic champion of the European Union Chirac's health steadily deteriorated after he stepped down until his death on Thursday. In 2005, he suffered a stroke, and in 2014 his wife Bernadette said he would no longer speak in public, noting he had memory trouble. Chirac also served as French prime minister twice, from 1974 to 1976 and from 1986 to 1988. Chirac was beset by a series of corruption scandals dating back to his tenure as the mayor of Paris between 1977 and 1995. He and his entourage were accused of using city funds to pay for his political party, the RPR. A ruling by the country's constitutional council in 1999 gave the president blanket immunity from prosecution while in office. But in 2011 he was convicted of diverting public funds while serving as mayor, a ruling Chirac rejected. He was found guilty and given a suspended sentence of two years, but remained popular despite his conviction.

"More than a quarter of secondary school pupils in England and Wales have received private tuition, according to research published by the Sutton Trust. The highest levels are in London - with 41% of secondary pupils getting extra lessons outside of school, it says. The social-mobility charity is calling for financial support for disadvantaged families to have access to tutoring. ""With costs of at least Â£25 per session, many parents can't afford it,"" said charity founder Sir Peter Lampl. The annual report from the Sutton Trust tracks the prevalence of parents paying for tuition. Such extra lessons have been seen as a hidden factor in exam results - but because of the cost, the charity warns this gives richer families an unfair advantage. Based on evidence from the National Foundation for Educational Research and a survey of almost 3,000 families, the report suggests 27% of 11 to 16-year-olds have had some private tuition while at secondary school. This is higher than the 18% who received tutoring in 2005 but has fallen back on a couple of years ago, when 30% had paid for extra lessons, it says. Poor pupils get less tutoring and help with homework The 'shadow business' of tutors and exam pressure But the use of tutors is skewed towards the affluent, with 34% of better-off families having used tutors compared with 20% of less well-off families. Paying for extra tuition is twice as common in England than Wales - 28% to 14% - and a separate figure for London suggests much higher levels of 41%. Extra help with GCSEs is the most common reason families pay for private tuition, the research suggests The most common reasons given for hiring tutors were helping with a specific GCSE exam and ""schoolwork in general"". The research suggests almost a quarter of classroom teachers in secondary school have worked as private tutors in the past two years, with most of these providing lessons after being asked by parents. The Sutton Trust says there is evidence such individual tutoring can make a positive difference. But it says there needs to be a way of making it available to the disadvantaged, such as providing means-tested vouchers. Trust founder and chairman Sir Peter Lampl said such a scheme would ""enable lower-income families to provide tuition for their children"" in an environment in which ""private tuition is widespread"". Mary Bousted, joint leader of the National Education Union, said such subsidies for tuition could seem appealing but the money would be better spent increasing budgets for underfunded schools or pupil premium funding to support disadvantaged pupils. Labour's annual conference has backed calls to move private schools into the state sector, but a party spokesman said this would not affect private tutoring outside school.

"This video can not be played The PM says the government will do what it can to help after 1,200 job losses at the firm Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he is ""disappointed"" at what has happened at Wrightbus and that the government will ""do what we can to help"". Efforts are under way to try to help 1,200 workers made redundant after the company entered administration. Just 50 jobs will be retained at the firm - the last UK-owned bus manufacturer. Administrators met unions on Thursday. Wrightbus administrators confirm 1,200 job losses Reaction to Ballymena firm entering administration Wrightbus: From driving seat to financial failure Bus firm faces questions over religious donations There have been calls for Mr Johnson to intervene. Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith told BBC NI's The View that he will be speaking to the administrators in the next 24 hours to see what can be done to save Wrightbus jobs. He said he will do everything to ""find somebody to rebuild that business"". The Ballymena-based bus-builder suffered cash flow problems and had sought investment or a new owner. Talks with two potential buyers of the firm, best known for building the New Routemaster, known as the ""Boris Bus"",failed to reach a conclusion last week. This video can not be played Mervyn Wilkinson was among the 1,200 Wrightbus employees made redundant on Wednesday. Mr Johnson described Wrightbus, which built the Routemaster bus when he was the London mayor, as a ""fantastic business"". ""We have been working on it the whole time,"" he told BBC News NI. ""You may know that the negotiations got very close, there was a particular problem that came up to do with the ownership of the land. ""We want to sort it out, we are going to do what we can to help."" Mr Johnson said he thought ""one of the problems"" was that London mayor, Sadiq Khan, should have continued with the London transport contract and that he understood there were ""also problems to do with the management of the company"". In a statement on Thursday evening, a spokesperson for Wrights said that last week there were two ""final bidders in discussions regarding acquisition of Wright Group"". ""A rental agreement for the sites was reached with one bidder, who then pulled out of the deal on Friday 20th,"" the statement added. ""A second bidder discussed purchasing the sites, but no formal letter of offer was made from that bidder. ""Any reports to the contrary are completely inaccurate."" Mr Johnson said Wrightbus was part of a ""big industrial agenda"" in relation to Northern Ireland, including the east Belfast shipyard Harland and Wolff ""where we have big plans"". ""Northern Ireland is a great opportunity area for our country,"" he added. The company had suffered cash flow problems and had sought investment or a new owner TUV councillor Timothy Gaston said Mid and East Antrim Council had contacted the prime minister, the secretary of state and the chairman of the NI Select Affairs Committee ""to again raise how vital Wrightbus is to Ballymena"". He added: ""Our PM has committed previously to do all he can to save Wrightbus. It's now time for action."" Mr Gaston said the council will have a dedicated website to help people access services, support and information and have organised a redundancy clinic for employees âªon Friday. Concern is also mounting for firms in the supply chain which are still owed money. Manufacturing NI chief Stephen Kelly said some had tried to protect themselves by taking out trade credit insurance or working on a basis of cash on delivery with the company. But he added that ""a lot of people are still holding a lot of stock and a lot of people are owed a lot of money"". This video can not be played Government must 'invest in Wrightbus' - Jackie Pollock, Unite regional secretary George Brash, of the Unite union, said that Boris Johnson recently told the House of Commons he would do everything for the future of the company. House sale fears after Wrightbus redundancy ""We are calling him out on that comment and those promises that he made to this workforce, and this Ballymena community,"" Mr Brash said. ""He needs to stand up and intervene as he said he would."" Steven Reynolds, chair of Ballymena Business Improvement District, said that the town was going through ""difficult times"". This video can not be played Staff at the Ballymena bus manufacturer fear for the future as 1,200 lose their jobs. ""It will have an impact, [but] let's remember Wrightbus is in administration not liquidation,"" he said. ""Every day is a new day, a new opportunity to do a deal and that may still be on the table."" Efforts are also under way to bring home former workers based outside Northern Ireland. The company had 20 members of staff working between Hong Kong and Malaysia. It is understood there are also around nine former staff members in England. Administrators are working to secure them transport home. Jonathan McKay from Cullybackey, who has been working for Wrightbus for the past 12 years, is currently in Taunton, in south-west England.

refusing to back down in describing the law designed to prevent a no deal

House of CommonsParliament The Commons has adjourned for the day. It will return next week on Monday at 14:30. Cross-party leaders aiming to ward off a no-deal Brexit have held talks about how to ensure the prime minister does not ignore new legislation by refusing to ask the EU for an extension. Jeremy Corbyn spoke with the SNP's Ian Blackford, the Lib Dems' Jo Swinson, the Independent Group for Change's Anna Soubry and Plaid Cymru's Liz Saville-Roberts about the Brexit extension law - or the Benn Act - that was pushed through Parliament earlier this month. Ms Swinson left the talks early to speak to police about a threat made against one of her young children. After the talks Ms Saville-Roberts said: ""We have got to get the Benn Act extension and we have to make sure that actually happens. There are a lot of pressures on, but that overrides everything."" Ms Soubry added: ""We did a pretty good job on the Benn Act, We think we're alright. But the trouble, I'm afraid to say, is that we have a prime minister who you cannot trust."" Politicians should not criticise drill music while using ""violent"" language themselves, a Labour MP says. Shadow cabinet office minister Cat Smith compared the words used by politicians to that of drill artists. Drill has been linked togangs, violence andmurderover the past few years. During a Commons debate on democracy, the MP for Lancaster and Fleetwood said: ""There is a sense of anger shared by many over the criminalisation of their music and the narrative coming from certain parts of the media that drill music is behind the tragic surge in violence."" ""Yet how are we as politicians in any position to accuse drill artists of glorifying violence when politicians themselves are not held responsible for the violent language they use and the impact it has on the culture and climate of debate?"" she said. ""What kind of lesson does this teach our young people?"" she added. BBC's chief political correspondent tweets... Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

House of CommonsParliament Maria Miller says MPs ""faced a perfect storm"" in Parliament yesterday, debating questions ""at the very heart of the principles of democracy"", such as freedom of speech and the rule of law. The Tory MP says both language and behaviour matter in politics. But she says the accusations being levelled at the prime minister were examples of ""inflammatory language accusing others of being inflammatory"", and that is ""as damaging as damaging can be"". ""We must tread carefully"", she says, comparing last's night's debate as ""high politics"" which ""risks people feeling as if they can't speak out"". And she defends the much-repeated phrase used by Boris Johnson - ""the surrender bill"". ""It is not [inflammatory].

"In a new Scottish book, 30 characters share the spotlight - they also share the struggle of living with a long-term health condition. Some are fighting physical illness, some are fighting substance abuse and mental health issues. Some aren't suffering, just coping on behalf of a loved one who is. Their stories are featured in a new charity book, Humans of Scotland. It has been put together by the Health and Social Care Alliance, which invited people to share their experiences through a storytelling project. And it has gained the backing of First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who has written the foreword. Former Scotland rugby internationalDoddie Weir, who has Motor Neurone Disease, andFrank's Law campaignerAmanda Kopel are among the familiar faces who feature in the book. But there are many more ""ordinary"" Scots who share their stories. Here is a selection: Michael Byrne from Stepps - survivor of the Clutha disaster Michael Byrne survived the Clutha disaster, but struggled with complex PTSD It was lonely and extremely painful. The loneliness was caused because no one could understand my pain. All you want to do is escape from the pain. You have something you believe no one can relate to. I went off the rails and sabotaged everything around me. Those four to five months were my darkest days. I clung onto life an hour at a time and that's what I've done ever since. I've got a two and a half-year-old. As bad as the pain was, I wanted to forge ahead. When I found out I had complex PTSD I was relieved. I was denying I was ill for a long, long time. It was a freedom to own it. It's me and that's it.  It's taken me 49 years to get to this point. I write poetry, I go to support groups, they are absolutely my medicine. I volunteer from Brothers in Arms Scotland and run a support group and I help out with Stigma Free Lanarkshire. I need some alone time. I need to do a bit of meditation, a bit of writing, it's blocking the outside world out because sometimes I'm noise sensitive, I'm light sensitive. I have to find a balance. I love waking up my son in the morning. It's the most beautiful moment of the day, just lifting him up and giving him a kiss. He's a beautiful boy. I look forward to making a difference to people in the future, even just by telling my story, if they think ""if that guy can do it, I'll go and talk to somebody"". Melanie McLean from Kilmarnock - has rheumatoid arthritis Melanie McLean was angry at her body for letting her down when she became a new mother I found a notebook that contained writing about the challenges, feelings and emotions I had within the first few months of having my baby. On opening the first page, I was transported to a time, not so long ago, where I was furious with my body for letting me down, for letting my baby down. I wroteâ¦ My body is letting me down. At eight months it has become physically impossible to hold her in my arms for more than two minutes at a time. I worry about not being able to be a proper mum as I'm not able to physically keep up as eight months of constant caring, being up, physical activity, the cycle of insomnia and knackeredness is really telling on my body. I have thoughts every night in bed of what I'd love to be able to do with her, but I can't do these things. I am aware of being physically weak and 'unable' for the first time in my life of living with rheumatoid arthritis. I can hardly get the sick drenched clothes off her or me, turn the dial on the shower or wash the sick off me, or dry myself, or get new clothes on, thanking god for my husband who is able to comfort her and clean up the mess.  And I get angry at my body and myself for not being able just to get things done, or deal with my current agony."" I remember that I had stopped writing because I was crying, with defeat in my heart. What I can tell you though, is that I picked up my defeated heart, dusted myself down and somewhere, from very deep within, found my usual defiance, looked ahead and kept on goingâ¦"" Imran Akhtar from Glasgow - suffered sudden sight loss Imran Akhtar lost his sight suddenly but found a new vocation in helping others going through similar experiences I was a post office manager at the time, and I was just standing at work one day and the sight in one eye just went. No warning, no pain, no nothing. I finished my shift and thought it might get better. The next day I went to the hospital and they said my retina had detached. They don't know why it happened. I was going in for my third operation and I noticed a little speck in my other eye. They said that retina has detached as well. I asked when I could get back to driving and they said it's never going to happen. In the waiting room I just started crying. I wasn't prepared for it, I wasn't expecting it. I thought I would just go back to my old life. I went home and stayed in bed for two weeks. Eventually I managed to pick myself up and went to theRNIB,externaland they said they could help me find a job. I started volunteering and eventually a full-time job came up. That came to an end and now I work forAccess to Work,external. I go out and see people with sight loss, hearing loss and dyslexia to offer help, support and advice. I feel like I've come full circle. I'm helping people who were in my position. The most amazing moment is when I'm seeing someone with sight loss and they see my white cane. Their mentality changes when they see somebody with sight loss doing this type of job. When I see the figures for people with disability in work it's heart breaking. They just need a little bit of support. It sounds weird to say, but losing my sight was one of the most positive experiences because now I'm helping people in a real way. Before that I was just plodding along rather than being in this great position. My confidence is sky high. If you're facing sight loss and you are feeling really low, just know there is help and support out there. You have to reach out to people and, I assure you, they will reach back and help you. Humans of Scotland was launched on 25 September and will be available free of charge. It will be distributed across all libraries in Scotland.

"HMP Coldingley was part of high-profile prison reforms in 2016 Prison inmates have been resorting to throwing human waste out of their cell windows because of a lack of toilets, a report has found. The Independent Monitoring Board said it was ""appalled at the lack of in-cell sanitation"" at Surrey's HMP Coldingley. It said prisoners were forced to use buckets in their cells at night and some would ""inevitably... dispose of human waste via cell windows"". The Ministry of Justice has pledged to ""address this long-standing issue"". More than 350 men live in cells without lavatories or sinks at the Category C prison near Bisley, the report said. HMP Coldingley was one of six institutions named as a ""reform prison"" in 2016, with governors granted extra powers in what the government called the ""biggest shake-up of the prisons system since the Victorian era"". It came alongside a commitment to spend Â£1.3bn to ""replace decrepit, ageing prisons with modern establishments"". Heather Cook, chair of the monitoring board at Coldingley, said the prison's biggest problem continued to be the ""poor state"" of four wings built in 1969, which were ""almost impossible to keep clean"". The board's report said the ""night sanitation arrangement"" at the jail was ""degrading and totally unsatisfactory"". At night, inmates had to press a buzzer and join a queue to be let out of their cell to use communal toilets. The report said queues could be long and a prisoner's ""only other option is to use a pot in his cell and then to 'slop out' in the morning"". Prison officers 'ignoring' body-cam rules Assaults in prison reach record high Violence cut at seven of 10 'challenging' prisons Frances Crook, chief executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform, said the problem stemmed from prisoners being locked in their cells during the day and ""sleeping through their sentences"", meaning they were more likely to be awake at night, needing the toilet. A Prison Service spokesman said: ""All prisoners have access to proper sanitation facilities and nearly 99% of them have access to in-cell toilets. ""HMP Coldingley, which was built in the 1960s, is one of the few prisons with shared toilets and installing in-cell facilities would cut its capacity in half."" He said prisoners can access a toilet at all times during the day and night through the use of computer controlled electronic unlocking at night. ""The overnight system is due to be upgraded next year,"" he said. The Independent Monitoring Board said it ""remains to be seen when this essential work will be undertaken"".

"Joanna Sim is part of a passionate Peloton tribe Joanna Sim is a self-confessed member of the Peloton cult. She gets up at 05:00 for the company's classes. Shewrites about them,externalon her blog for working parents. She doesn't just like Peloton, she says, she loves it. ""It's almost borderline addiction at this point,"" she says. Now she's planning to invest. The company, which sells tech-enhanced exercise equipment tied to streaming fitness classes, raised about $1.16bn as it sold its first shares on the Nasdaq stock exchange on Thursday. The shares priced at $29 apiece, valuing the firm at more than $8bn (Â£6.5bn) - a hefty figure in a notoriously fickle fitness industry. But they tumbled lower as trading began, closing down 11%. Peloton acolytes such as Joanna say the company has matched exercise to the age of social media, combining the convenience of an at-home workout with the interaction and adrenaline rush of live classes. The company, which was founded in 2012, has more than 500,000 subscribers. It went live in the UK and Canada in 2018 and in Germany in May. It has started branching out to new areas, offering classes in yoga and strength-training. High-profile users include Kate Hudson, David Beckham, Leonardo DiCaprio, Michael Phelps, Usain Bolt and more. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

Peloton's stationary bikes cost more than $2,200 (in the UK they start at Â£1,990) and its treadmills, which it started selling last year, are almost double that. Unlimited access to the streaming classes runs to another $39 a month (Â£39 a month in the UK). Despite the price tag, Joanna says she ""took the plunge"" last year, cancelling her gym membership and buying a bike in the hope it would make it easier to fit in more workouts. The mother of two, who lives in California and works full-time as a design strategist at software company Intuit, has not been disappointed. She says the flexibility of the company's programmes, and the ""tribe"" of fellow riders she interacts with during a regular 05:00 class, have kept her coming back for more, and more. Her enthusiasm extends to the firm's financial prospects. ""They're going to IPO soon and I'm... all over it,"" she says. Peloton made $915m in revenue in its most recent financial year, more than double the year before, which was double the year before that. But growth has come with costs. Peloton's tech-enhanced equipment offers live fitness classes at home Peloton remains unprofitable, losing about $200m last year, as its marketing expense skyrocketed. In the run-up to its flotation, music publishers hit the company with a $300m copyright lawsuit, accusing the firm of using music for its classes without permission. And sceptics are asking if the firm, which today relies on big-ticket purchases of equipment, has staying power, given the appearance of lower-cost competitors and fast changing fitness fads. ""It's very difficult to double every year,"" says Rett Wallace, chief executive of research firm Triton. ""Right now, it looks like we're still very much in a growth phase on the hardware but we don't know how long that will last.""Â Other fitness firms testing the public markets in recent years haven't fared particularly well. Can Fitbit get itself back into shape? Why are Americans hooked on SoulCycle? The pricey cycling studio chain SoulCycle, which once claimed cachet similar to Peloton, filed flotation papers in 2015. But the company, a subsidiary of property giant Related Co, dropped those plans last year, citing ""market conditions"". This summer, the mood soured farther, when owner Steve Ross's fundraiser for President Donald Trump triggereda customer boycott. YogaWorks debuted on the Nasdaq in 2017, after a growth sprint fuelled by private equity backer Great Hill Partners turned it into one of the largest yoga chains in the US. Less than two years later, the firm de-listed its shares, amid mounting losses and a warning from the exchange that the stock's price no longer met the minimum threshold. And it's not just fitness chains focused on live classes that have struggled. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

Shares in FitBit, which makes wearable fitness trackers, approached $50 in the summer of 2015, when the rapidly growing firm went public. But sales soon slumped and today, the shares trade at about $4. ""Hardware is difficult. Fitness is difficult,"" says Mr Wallace. ""If you rely on the sale of hardware, even Apple shows us that if you're not reinventing your hardware all the time, your life can become difficult."" ""Peloton seems to have established a brand for itself and has a very loyal user base,"" he adds. ""We'll see if that sticks."" Joanna says she's heard the doubts but her experience convinced her that Peloton has a long ride ahead of it. ""Given the amount of content that they're pumping out and the leadership that they have... I have full confidence,"" she says.

"This video can not be played Trump impeachment: Was there a quid pro quo? The Trump administration has released details of a phone conversation in July that has triggered a US impeachment inquiry against the president. According to the notes, Donald Trump asked the Ukrainian leader to look into corruption claims involving the son of Joe Biden, Mr Trump's possible rival in next year's presidential election. Concerns about the call were initially raised by a whistleblower. The Democrats accused Mr Trump of seeking foreign help to smear a rival. Under the US constitution, a president can be impeached for ""treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanours"" - a procedure that can lead to removal from office. In July, Mr Trump froze military aid to Ukraine but he has insisted that this was not used to put pressure on the new government in Kiev. Dissecting phone call behind Trump impeachment push Trump call could embarrass Ukraine's president Mr Trump discusses with his newly elected Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky, the 2016 removal of a prosecutor, Viktor Shokin,according to notes of their 25 July telephone conversation released by the White House,external. The US president is quoted as saying in the half-hour call: ""I heard you had a prosecutor who was very good and he was shut down and that's really unfair. ""A lot of people are talking about that, the way they shut your very good prosecutor down and you had some very bad people involved."" He continues: ""The other thing, there's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution [of Mr Biden's son] and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the [US] Attorney General would be great. This video can not be played Trump: 'It was going to be the call from hell. It turned out to be a nothing call' ""Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it... It sounds horrible to me."" Mr Zelensky says in response: ""We will take care of that and we will work on the investigation of the case."" Thanking Mr Trump, Mr Zelensky says he stayed in Trump Tower in New York City during a previous visit to the US. On the call, the US president also asks Mr Zelensky to work with US Attorney General William Barr and Mr Trump's personal lawyer, Rudolph Giuliani, to look into the matter, according to the notes. The Department of Justice said on Wednesday that Mr Trump had not spoken with the attorney general about having Ukraine investigate Mr Biden, and Mr Barr had not communicated with Ukraine. Mr Trump and his conservative allies have focused on how Mr Biden, as US vice-president in 2016, lobbied Ukraine to fire Mr Shokin. Mr Shokin's office had opened an investigation into Burisma, a natural gas company on which Mr Biden's son, Hunter Biden, was a board member. This video can not be played ""He's violated so many clauses of the constitution"" - US citizens react to impeachment inquiry Other Western officials had called for Mr Shokin to be fired because of the perception that he was soft on corruption. Mr Biden last year told a foreign policy event how he threatened to withhold $1bn in aid to Ukraine unless Mr Shokin was removed. No evidence has come to light so far of wrongdoing by the Bidens. 18 July - President Trump orders White House aide to hold back almost $400m in military aid to Ukraine, report US media 25 July - President Trump speaks with Ukraine's leader in a 30-minute phone call 9 September - Congress learns of a whistleblower's complaint about the call, but is blocked by the Trump administration from viewing it 11 September - Military aid for Ukraine is cleared for release by the Pentagon and US Department of State 23 September - Trump confirms he withheld Ukrainian aid, saying it was due to concerns about ""corruption"" 24 September - Trump says the aid was withheld so that other countries would pay more What's the Trump-Ukraine story about? Mr Trump had promised that a ""complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript"" of the 25 July call would be released. But the details disclosed by the White House on Wednesday morning were notes of the conversation taken by US officials who listened in. The July call occurred days after Mr Trump directed the US government to withhold about $391m (Â£316m) in military aid to Ukraine. In the summary of the call, Mr Trump does not tell the Ukrainian president that US aid hinges upon him investigating Mr Biden. But Mr Trump stresses the importance of US financial support, before pressing Mr Zelensky for action on the Democratic candidate. ""I will say that we do a lot for Ukraine,"" Mr Trump says. In one of the most cryptic passages from the call, Mr Trump mentions a ""server"" and CrowdStrike. He asks Mr Zelensky to ""do us a favour"" adding: ""I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say CrowdStrike... I guess you have one of your wealthy people... The server, they say Ukraine has it."" CrowdStrike is a cyber-security firm that was hired by the Democratic National Committee (DNC) to investigate the 2016 hack of the party's email server. That cyber-breach led to the leak of numerous emails that embarrassed Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. CrowdStrike determined a pair of hacking groups with suspected Russian ties was responsible for the hack. Mr Trump has previously questioned why the DNC did not turn over the hacked email server to the FBI, instead of asking CrowdStrike to investigate. The US president told the Associated Press news agency in April 2017 that he had ""heard"" CrowdStrike was ""owned by a very rich Ukranian"". In the phone call with Mr Zelensky, Mr Trump appears to suggest the DNC server is stored somewhere in Ukraine. On Wednesday morning at the United Nations General Assembly in New York City, Mr Trump said it was the ""single greatest witch hunt in American history"". ""The way you had that built up that call, it was going to be the call from hell,"" said Mr Trump, who is up for re-election in November 2020. ""It turned out to be a nothing call."" Speaking alongside Mr Trump at the event, Mr Zelensky told reporters: ""You heard that we had a, I think, good phone call. ""It was normal. We spoke about many things, so I think you read it that nobody pushed me."" ""In other words, no pressure,"" interjected Mr Trump. But California Democrat Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, told reporters the phone call shows ""a classic, mafia-like shakedown of a foreign leader"". The Democratic leader of the House of Representatives, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, on Tuesday threw her weight behind an official impeachment inquiry into the president's actions. A House vote to impeach the president could trigger a trial in the Senate on whether to remove Mr Trump from office. Congress' probe focuses partly on whether Trump abused his presidential powers and sought to help his own re-election by seeking the aid of a foreign government to undermine Mr Biden. Mrs Pelosi said such actions would mark a ""betrayal of his oath of office"" and declared: ""No one is above the law."" Why Pelosi made her move How the impeachment process works This video can not be played Pelosi: ""The president must be held accountable; no one is above the law."" The inspector general for the intelligence community wrote to the Director of National Intelligence in August about the Trump-Zelenksy call. A whistleblower from within the US intelligence community had filed a complaint about the matter. Federal law requires such complaints to be disclosed to Congress, but the Trump administration has so far refused to do so. The US Department of Justice says the whistleblower had heard the information from ""White House officials"", and did not have first-hand knowledge of the call. The department's spokeswoman, Kerri Kupec, said on Wednesday it had reviewed a record of the phone call, and determined ""there was no campaign finance violation and that no further action was required"".

"The introduction of minimum pricing for alcohol in Scotland appears to have cut drinking, a study suggests. Since May 2018, the price of alcohol has had to be at least 50p per unit. The study published in the British Medical Journal looked at how much alcohol was bought in shops before and after the move up to the end of 2018. It found the amount purchased per person per week fell by 1.2 units - the equivalent of just over half a pint of beer or a measure of spirits. The biggest fall was among the heaviest fifth of drinkers - the amount purchased by this group fell by two units. But overall Scots were still buying more than 14 units a week, the recommended limit, after the introduction of the new drinking laws. What is more, the analysis excluded pubs, bars and restaurants, where about a quarter of drinks are purchased. Scotland was the first country in the world to introduce a minimum price based on the strength of alcoholic drinks. Research findings have led to calls for the policy to be adopted across the UK. Wales is looking to introduce minimum pricing in 2020, but neither England nor Northern Ireland currently have plans to set a limit. New drink laws 'implemented effectively' Alcohol price law in Wales delayed to 2020 England 'not tackling alcohol epidemic' Researchers, led by a team at Newcastle University, looked at how much alcohol people were buying in shops and supermarkets, but not in pubs. They analysed the purchasing habits of 60,000 English and Scottish households between 2015 and 2018. Just over 5,000 of them were in Scotland. The English households were used as a control group to measure what would have happened if there had not been a minimum price in Scotland. While households in England increased their consumption slightly, Scottish purchasing fell. The study said overall it represented a fall of 7.6%, or 1.2 units, a week per adult on what would have been expected. The team said that was about twice the impact predicted ahead of the move. Reductions were most noticeable for beer, spirits, and cider, including own-brand spirits and high-strength white ciders. But the team acknowledged there needed to be longer-term follow up to see if the drop was sustained, as there was some evidence that in the later months of 2018 consumption had begun to rise again. Lead researcher Prof Peter Anderson said: ""You would expect some levelling off from the initial impact, but I think the findings are enough to suggest minimum pricing is effective and should be adopted across the UK."" Eric Carlin from the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh, agreed the evidence was compelling, but he said risky alcohol consumption was a ""complex"" public health issue. ""No single policy lever should be seen as a panacea,"" he added. Scottish public health minister Joe Fitzpatrick said the findings were ""very encouraging"".

"This video can not be played Trump impeachment: Was there a quid pro quo? The Trump administration has released details of a phone conversation in July that has triggered a US impeachment inquiry against the president. According to the notes, Donald Trump asked the Ukrainian leader to look into corruption claims involving the son of Joe Biden, Mr Trump's possible rival in next year's presidential election. Concerns about the call were initially raised by a whistleblower. The Democrats accused Mr Trump of seeking foreign help to smear a rival. Under the US constitution, a president can be impeached for ""treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanours"" - a procedure that can lead to removal from office. In July, Mr Trump froze military aid to Ukraine but he has insisted that this was not used to put pressure on the new government in Kiev. Dissecting phone call behind Trump impeachment push Trump call could embarrass Ukraine's president Mr Trump discusses with his newly elected Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky, the 2016 removal of a prosecutor, Viktor Shokin,according to notes of their 25 July telephone conversation released by the White House,external. The US president is quoted as saying in the half-hour call: ""I heard you had a prosecutor who was very good and he was shut down and that's really unfair. ""A lot of people are talking about that, the way they shut your very good prosecutor down and you had some very bad people involved."" He continues: ""The other thing, there's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution [of Mr Biden's son] and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the [US] Attorney General would be great. This video can not be played Trump: 'It was going to be the call from hell. It turned out to be a nothing call' ""Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it... It sounds horrible to me."" Mr Zelensky says in response: ""We will take care of that and we will work on the investigation of the case."" Thanking Mr Trump, Mr Zelensky says he stayed in Trump Tower in New York City during a previous visit to the US. On the call, the US president also asks Mr Zelensky to work with US Attorney General William Barr and Mr Trump's personal lawyer, Rudolph Giuliani, to look into the matter, according to the notes. The Department of Justice said on Wednesday that Mr Trump had not spoken with the attorney general about having Ukraine investigate Mr Biden, and Mr Barr had not communicated with Ukraine. Mr Trump and his conservative allies have focused on how Mr Biden, as US vice-president in 2016, lobbied Ukraine to fire Mr Shokin. Mr Shokin's office had opened an investigation into Burisma, a natural gas company on which Mr Biden's son, Hunter Biden, was a board member. This video can not be played ""He's violated so many clauses of the constitution"" - US citizens react to impeachment inquiry Other Western officials had called for Mr Shokin to be fired because of the perception that he was soft on corruption. Mr Biden last year told a foreign policy event how he threatened to withhold $1bn in aid to Ukraine unless Mr Shokin was removed. No evidence has come to light so far of wrongdoing by the Bidens. 18 July - President Trump orders White House aide to hold back almost $400m in military aid to Ukraine, report US media 25 July - President Trump speaks with Ukraine's leader in a 30-minute phone call 9 September - Congress learns of a whistleblower's complaint about the call, but is blocked by the Trump administration from viewing it 11 September - Military aid for Ukraine is cleared for release by the Pentagon and US Department of State 23 September - Trump confirms he withheld Ukrainian aid, saying it was due to concerns about ""corruption"" 24 September - Trump says the aid was withheld so that other countries would pay more What's the Trump-Ukraine story about? Mr Trump had promised that a ""complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript"" of the 25 July call would be released. But the details disclosed by the White House on Wednesday morning were notes of the conversation taken by US officials who listened in. The July call occurred days after Mr Trump directed the US government to withhold about $391m (Â£316m) in military aid to Ukraine. In the summary of the call, Mr Trump does not tell the Ukrainian president that US aid hinges upon him investigating Mr Biden. But Mr Trump stresses the importance of US financial support, before pressing Mr Zelensky for action on the Democratic candidate. ""I will say that we do a lot for Ukraine,"" Mr Trump says. In one of the most cryptic passages from the call, Mr Trump mentions a ""server"" and CrowdStrike. He asks Mr Zelensky to ""do us a favour"" adding: ""I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say CrowdStrike... I guess you have one of your wealthy people... The server, they say Ukraine has it."" CrowdStrike is a cyber-security firm that was hired by the Democratic National Committee (DNC) to investigate the 2016 hack of the party's email server. That cyber-breach led to the leak of numerous emails that embarrassed Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. CrowdStrike determined a pair of hacking groups with suspected Russian ties was responsible for the hack. Mr Trump has previously questioned why the DNC did not turn over the hacked email server to the FBI, instead of asking CrowdStrike to investigate. The US president told the Associated Press news agency in April 2017 that he had ""heard"" CrowdStrike was ""owned by a very rich Ukranian"". In the phone call with Mr Zelensky, Mr Trump appears to suggest the DNC server is stored somewhere in Ukraine. On Wednesday morning at the United Nations General Assembly in New York City, Mr Trump said it was the ""single greatest witch hunt in American history"". ""The way you had that built up that call, it was going to be the call from hell,"" said Mr Trump, who is up for re-election in November 2020. ""It turned out to be a nothing call."" Speaking alongside Mr Trump at the event, Mr Zelensky told reporters: ""You heard that we had a, I think, good phone call. ""It was normal. We spoke about many things, so I think you read it that nobody pushed me."" ""In other words, no pressure,"" interjected Mr Trump. But California Democrat Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, told reporters the phone call shows ""a classic, mafia-like shakedown of a foreign leader"". The Democratic leader of the House of Representatives, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, on Tuesday threw her weight behind an official impeachment inquiry into the president's actions. A House vote to impeach the president could trigger a trial in the Senate on whether to remove Mr Trump from office. Congress' probe focuses partly on whether Trump abused his presidential powers and sought to help his own re-election by seeking the aid of a foreign government to undermine Mr Biden. Mrs Pelosi said such actions would mark a ""betrayal of his oath of office"" and declared: ""No one is above the law."" Why Pelosi made her move How the impeachment process works This video can not be played Pelosi: ""The president must be held accountable; no one is above the law."" The inspector general for the intelligence community wrote to the Director of National Intelligence in August about the Trump-Zelenksy call. A whistleblower from within the US intelligence community had filed a complaint about the matter. Federal law requires such complaints to be disclosed to Congress, but the Trump administration has so far refused to do so. The US Department of Justice says the whistleblower had heard the information from ""White House officials"", and did not have first-hand knowledge of the call. The department's spokeswoman, Kerri Kupec, said on Wednesday it had reviewed a record of the phone call, and determined ""there was no campaign finance violation and that no further action was required"".

"The introduction of minimum pricing for alcohol in Scotland appears to have cut drinking, a study suggests. Since May 2018, the price of alcohol has had to be at least 50p per unit. The study published in the British Medical Journal looked at how much alcohol was bought in shops before and after the move up to the end of 2018. It found the amount purchased per person per week fell by 1.2 units - the equivalent of just over half a pint of beer or a measure of spirits. The biggest fall was among the heaviest fifth of drinkers - the amount purchased by this group fell by two units. But overall Scots were still buying more than 14 units a week, the recommended limit, after the introduction of the new drinking laws. What is more, the analysis excluded pubs, bars and restaurants, where about a quarter of drinks are purchased. Scotland was the first country in the world to introduce a minimum price based on the strength of alcoholic drinks. Research findings have led to calls for the policy to be adopted across the UK. Wales is looking to introduce minimum pricing in 2020, but neither England nor Northern Ireland currently have plans to set a limit. New drink laws 'implemented effectively' Alcohol price law in Wales delayed to 2020 England 'not tackling alcohol epidemic' Researchers, led by a team at Newcastle University, looked at how much alcohol people were buying in shops and supermarkets, but not in pubs. They analysed the purchasing habits of 60,000 English and Scottish households between 2015 and 2018. Just over 5,000 of them were in Scotland. The English households were used as a control group to measure what would have happened if there had not been a minimum price in Scotland. While households in England increased their consumption slightly, Scottish purchasing fell. The study said overall it represented a fall of 7.6%, or 1.2 units, a week per adult on what would have been expected. The team said that was about twice the impact predicted ahead of the move. Reductions were most noticeable for beer, spirits, and cider, including own-brand spirits and high-strength white ciders. But the team acknowledged there needed to be longer-term follow up to see if the drop was sustained, as there was some evidence that in the later months of 2018 consumption had begun to rise again. Lead researcher Prof Peter Anderson said: ""You would expect some levelling off from the initial impact, but I think the findings are enough to suggest minimum pricing is effective and should be adopted across the UK."" Eric Carlin from the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh, agreed the evidence was compelling, but he said risky alcohol consumption was a ""complex"" public health issue. ""No single policy lever should be seen as a panacea,"" he added. Scottish public health minister Joe Fitzpatrick said the findings were ""very encouraging"".

"The German subsidiary believes that by filing for insolvency it can save its national brands Thomas Cook's German subsidiary has announced it is filing for insolvency in an attempt to save its national brands after the collapse of the UK parent company on Monday. Almost 100,000 holidaymakers are travelling with the German affiliates and it is not clear what the bankruptcy proceedings will mean for them. The German government has already granted a â¬380m (Â£335m; $420m) bridging loan to the holiday airline Condor. Condor is 49% owned by Thomas Cook. The central state of Hesse, where Condor is based, also stepped in to rescue the airline, arguing that it was profitable. The company said it was ""operationally healthy"" and the six-month loan was aimed at preventing any ""bottlenecks"" resulting from its British parent company. The funding will be paid out pending an agreement with the European Commission. Thomas Cook Germany is also based in Hesse and state premier Volker Bouffier said it was in principle willing to step in to help that company too. It said that it had long been burdened by the weak Thomas Cook business in Great Britain and by Brexit. A total of 600,00 holidaymakers have been caught up in the collapse of the UK company. Many have travelled from the UK but Thomas Cook's empire stretches across Europe and tens of thousands have travelled with its subsidiaries. Under EU package holiday rules,holidaymakers are protected financially,externalfrom a company's insolvency as well as having the right to repatriation. The UK's Civil Aviation Authority has had the task of bringing back more than 150,000 holidaymakers. It repatriated more than 14,000 passengers on Tuesday and was expecting to bring back another 16,500 on Wednesday. This video can not be played A passenger raises funds for Thomas Cook staff on a flight from Turkey Thousands of Dutch, Belgian and Polish tourists are still abroad, but the biggest group affected outside the UK is from Germany. A spokeswoman said on Wednesday that 97,000 people were currently travelling with the company. Live updates: Thomas Cook repatriation continues Holidaymakers 'can leave Cuba', says CAA Impact of Thomas Cook's collapse around the world Thomas Cook collapse: Your rights explained Thomas Cook Germany employs some 2,000 people and has several national brands, including Neckermann, Ãger Tours, Air Marin and Bucher Reisen. A thousand people are employed by the company near Frankfurt. It said it was talking to the German foreign ministry as well as the travel bankruptcy insurer, Zurich, about repatriating customers. Like Condor, it has asked the Hesse state government and the federal government for a bridging loan. The German subsidiary believes its brands have a future and is in negotiations with investors and hotel operators to continue in business. Thomas Cook GmbH said it had been forced to seek insolvency to extricate itself from its (UK) parent company's ""financial tie-ups and related liabilities"". Allow Twitter content?

In the UK, anyone who has bought a package holiday covered by the Air Travel Organiser's Licence scheme (Atol) will have the cost refunded. However, some customers whose future holidays have been cancelled have seen the price of replacement deals spiral.

"This video can not be played Vaping fears: 'A new generation of nicotine addicts' Kevin Burns, chief executive of vaping firm Juul, has stepped down, amid growing concerns around vaping health risks and criticism of its marketing. The firm has also announced it will withdraw all US advertising. Mr Burns will be replaced immediately by KC Crosthwaite, former chief growth officer at tobacco giant Altria,Juul said,external. Juul is 35%-owned by Altria, and in the past has been accused of targeting vaping devices at children. Mr Burns said: ""Since joining Juul Labs, I have worked non-stop, helping turn a small firm into a worldwide business, so a few weeks ago I decided that now was the right time for me to step down."" At the same time, Altria said its merger talks with fellow cigarette-maker Phillip Morris would not move forward. The changes come as Juul faces serious threats to its once explosive growth. The Trump administration this month said it was preparing a nationwide ban on flavoured e-cigarettes. Juul is also facing multiple investigations, including into its marketing practices. Walmart ceases e-cigarette sales Juul 'ignored law' in US e-cigarette adverts 'Half as many Britons' vape as smoke Juul has for years promoted its e-cigarettes, which contain addictive nicotine, as a safer alternative to traditional tobacco products. However, the Food and Drug Administration recently warned Juul against making health claims without presenting scientific evidence to authorities for approval. Former Juul chief Kevin Burns Juul said it would not lobby against the proposed ban on flavoured e-cigarettes. However, Mr Crosthwaite said he remains committed to making Juul's products available to adult smokers. ""Unfortunately, today that future is at risk due to unacceptable levels of youth usage and eroding public confidence in our industry,"" he said. The crackdown on Juul, which dominates the US e-cigarette market, follows a spate of serious lung injuries in the US linked to vaping. Health authorities have not blamed the outbreak, in which nine people have died and more than 530 people been taken ill, on any one product. Most of the patients had a history of using vaping products that contain THC, the chemical in marijuana, they said. However, the injuries have raised alarm, especially in conjunction with surging rates of teen vaping. Two US states, New York and Michigan, have already imposed bans on flavoured e-cigarettes, while Massachusetts has announced a four-month ban on all vaping products. Walmart last week announced it would stop e-cigarette sales, citing the regulatory uncertainty.
