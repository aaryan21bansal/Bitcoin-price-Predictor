"Coronavirus awareness campaigns have been held in a number of countries around the world The current coronavirus outbreak is the biggest challenge for the world since World War Two, UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres has warned. He said it could bring a recession ""that probably has no parallel in the recent past"". His warning comes amid dire predictions about the possible economic impact of measures imposed to fight the virus. The number of confirmed cases around the world is now nearing 860,000, with more than 42,000 deaths. The death toll in the US is now more than 4,000 - higher than the declared number of fatalities in China, where the outbreak began late last year. Johns Hopkins University said 865 people had died in the past 24 hours in the US and in all more than 189,000 people in the country had been infected. Live: Latest updates on the coronavirus crisis Trump extends US virus guidelines to end of April Trump backs away from New York 'quarantine' About three out of four Americans are now, or about to be, under some form of lockdown,as more US states tighten measures to fight the coronavirus, which causes the Covid-19 disease. Meanwhile, Spain, second only to Italy in the number of recorded fatalities, has seen 849 deaths in the last 24 hours - the highest number it has had in a single day. In the UK, a total of 1,789 people have died - a rise of 381, officials say.Among the victims was a 13-year-old boy,King's College Hospital Trust in London said. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate? STRESS:How to protect your mental health MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak Speaking at the UN headquarters in New York at the launch of a report on the potential socioeconomic impact of the outbreak, Mr Guterres said: ""The new coronavirus disease is attacking societies at their core, claiming lives and people's livelihoods"". AntÃ³nio Guterres: ""What the world needs now is solidarity."" Countries around the world have imposed a series of measures, including restricting people's movements and closing most businesses, to curb the spread of the virus. The UN report estimates that up to 25 million jobs could be lost around the world as the result of the outbreak. It also projects an up to 40% ""downward pressure"" on global foreign direct investment flows. ""Covid-19 is the greatest test that we have faced together since the formation of the United Nations,"" he said, calling for ""an immediate co-ordinated health response to suppress transmission and end the pandemic"". This video can not be played US death rates v UK, Italy and South Korea Mr Guterres urged the industrialised nations to help those less developed, or potentially ""face the nightmare of the disease spreading like wildfire"". On Tuesday,the World Bank warned that ""significant economic pain""seemed ""unavoidable in all countries"", and households that depend on industries particularly vulnerable to the impact of the virus were at ""higher risk"". This video can not be played Why staying at home in is a matter of life and death Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump told Americans to prepare themselves for ""a very, very painful two weeks"", as modelling by the White House's coronavirus task force estimated that at least 100,000 could die in the coming months. Infectious diseases adviser Anthony Fauci said that ""as sobering a number as that is, we should be prepared for it"", while stressing that authorities were doing their utmost to prevent it. President Donald Trump had already announced the need to significantly extend social distancing guidelines beyond the two weeks just completed, saying people would need to stay at home as much as they possibly could for another month. At Tuesday's White House briefing he turned the microphone over to his medical experts to help him persuade Americans to comply. They explained that the aim was to bring down the number of new cases in the hotspots, especially New York, and prevent runaway outbreaks in other states. Infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci said steps taken so far had already begun to have an effect, and now was not the time to take the foot off the accelerator. But even with strict measures the White House is projecting that between 100,000 and 240,000 Americans will die of the coronavirus pandemic. New York will be the first to feel the brunt of that. It's focused on preparing enough beds and getting enough medical equipment for when the number of cases reaches its peak - in about two weeks' time. Italyremains the worst affected country in the world. Tuesday's figures show the official death toll rose by 837 deaths to 12,428, more than the 812 recorded on Monday. The number of new infections was 2,107, which was higher than the previous day, but a marked decline on numbers a few days ago. Francehas recorded 499 new hospital deaths in the last 24 hours, bringing the total to 3,523.

"People queueing outside a supermarket Aldi, Morrisons, Waitrose and Asda are easing restrictions on some of their products which were imposed in the wake of stockpiling earlier this month. All the major supermarkets restricted customers to buying fixed numbers of individual items to keep shelves full. Aldi is now scrapping limits completely on all but a few items, while Morrisons, Waitrose and Asda  have also removed some limits and changed others. Meanwhile, grocery sales in the UK were at record levels in March. Aldi customers will be able to buy as many as they want of most items in its stores. However, they will only be allowed to purchase four of some - including hand wash and soap, toilet roll, certain canned goods and alcohol - and  two of antibacterial hand gel, UHT milk and baby formula. Morrisons is upping the limits on some items from three to four per customer and removing some altogether to make it easier for people to donate to food banks. The supermarket will create local drop-off points for customers to donate products to others and will distribute Â£10m of food to food banks itself. How are supermarkets keeping customers safe? Supermarkets 'drastically' cutting product ranges Waitrose is removing its cap on all fresh food, so meat, fish, poultry and other fresh goods can now be purchased freely along with fruit and vegetables. Alcohol and Easter confectionery are also not subject to limits, although restrictions do remain on certain items. Asda is removing limits on fruit and vegetables and chilled products. Tesco, Sainsbury's and Co-op are not changing their policies on restrictions at the moment. Meanwhile, figures from consumer analysts Kantar showed huge increases in shopping in the UK this month. The busiest spell was from 16-19 March, when 88% of households visited a food store, adding up to 42 million extra trips across four days. In the last four weeks, year-on-year supermarket sales grew by 20.6%. Kantar's Fraser McKevitt said Â£10.8bn sales in the past four weeks were ""even higher than levels seen at Christmas"". The figures have mainly risen because of people making extra shopping trips, rather than spending more on each visit. The average household spent an extra Â£62.92 during the past four weeks, equivalent to adding five days' worth of groceries. London had the biggest increase, with grocery spending up by 26% during the month. EASY STEPS:What can I do? CONTAINMENT:What it means to self-isolate UK LATEST:What's the UK's plan and what could happen next? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash Mr McKevitt added: ""It's inevitable that shoppers will add extra items to their baskets when faced with restrictions on their movement. ""With restaurants and cafes now closed, none of us can eat meals on the go any longer and an extra 503 million meals, mainly lunches and snacks, will be prepared and eaten at home every week for the foreseeable future."" Online grocery spending was 13% higher than in the same period last year. The average online basket cost Â£81.88, which was Â£6 more than in March 2019, while 14.6% of households received an online delivery - up from 13.8% at the same time last year. Sales of alcohol rose by 22% - an extra Â£199m. There was also a rise in spending for families with children over the age of 16, which is likely to be down to the youngsters returning early from college or university. Those families spent Â£508 on average on groceries in March, Â£88.13 more than they did in the same month last year. Supermarket spending data from analysts Nielsen showed that in the week ending 21 March, many shoppers had filled their cupboards and instead were deciding to stock up the freezer. Its figures showed that sales of frozen food that week rose by 84% compared with the same period last year. Nielsen's Mike Watkins said there had been a ""seismic shift in overall shopping patterns"". He added: ""Unlike stores, there is a finite capacity for online grocery shopping, due to warehouse capacity and available delivery slots, and this will have limited the growth of online sales."" Online deliveries have been a sticking point for many people, who have found themselves unable to book slots and followPrime Minister Boris Johnson's request to use online deliveriesand stay at home. Tesco, which last weeklimited online orders to 80 items only,has now expanded its home delivery and click and collect services to about 780,000 slots this week - up from 660,000 two weeks ago. It has plans to add another 100,000 slots in the coming weeks. It has also recruited more than 7,500 staff and added more than 200 new vans to its fleet. Asda is also recruiting more delivery drivers, while Sainsbury's has introduced priority slots for elderly and vulnerable customers and is contacting eligible customers on its database. Morrisons is creating 3,500 new jobs to help expand its online delivery service, while Waitrose says it will set aside at least a quarter of its delivery slots to elderly or vulnerable people and is working to identify eligible customers.

"The normally-busy Times Square is almost deserted as New Yorkers stay in their homes Stock markets around the world suffered historic losses in the first three months of the year amid a massive sell-off tied to the coronavirus. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and London's FTSE 100 saw their biggest quarterly drops since 1987, plunging 23% and 25% respectively. The S&P 500 lost 20% during the quarter, its worst since 2008. The drops come as authorities order a halt to most activity in an effort to slow the spread of the virus. Economists have warned the hit to the global economy is likely to be worse than the financial crisis, with forecasters for IHS Markit, for example, predicting growth will shrink 2.8% this year, compared to a 1.7% drop in 2009. No country has been left untouched. The data firm expects China's growth to sputter to 2%, while the UK could see growth drop 4.5%. The outlook for countries such as Italy and less developed economies is even worse. ""We remain very concerned about the negative outlook for global growth in 2020 and in particular about the strain a downturn would have on emerging markets and low income countries,"" the president of the International Monetary Fund, Kristalina Georgieva, said on Tuesday. In the US, one central bank analysis suggested the unemployment rate could rise to more than 32% over the next three months, as more than 47 million people lose their jobs. Globally, many indexes remain more than 20% lower than they were at the start of the year. A steep slide in oil prices, due to a drop in demand and a price war between producers, has compounded the problems on financial markets. Governments have pledged massive rescue funds, which has helped to lift share prices in recent days. On Tuesday, the FTSE gained almost 2%, while Germany's Dax and France's CAC 40 saw more modest gains. But the main US indexes stumbled, with the Dow dropping 1.8%, the S&P 500 down 1.6%, and the Nasdaq off almost 1%. Energy and financial firms were among the worst performers in the quarter. Retailers, which have seen sales evaporate as stores closed, suffered some of the biggest losses on Tuesday, with Macy's down almost 9% a day after it said it would put the majority of its staff on unpaid leave. ""Despite monetary and financial stimulus, we expect volatility of equities to remain elevated as long as the duration and impact of Covid-19 remain unknown, oil prices stay depressed and earnings visibility is murky,"" analysts for US Bank Wealth Management wrote.

"This video can not be played WATCH: Why Oxford University experts are urging the rollout of a coronavirus app A coronavirus app that alerts people if they have recently been in contact with someone testing positive for the virus ""could play a critical role"" in limiting lockdowns, scientists advising the government have said. The location-tracking tech would enable a week's worth of manual detective work to be done in an instant, they say. But the academics say no-one should be forced to enrol - at least initially. UK health chiefs have confirmed they are exploring the idea. ""NHSX is looking at whether app-based solutions might be helpful in tracking and managing coronavirus, and we have assembled expertise from inside and outside the organisation to do this as rapidly as possible,"" said the tech-focused division's chief Matthew Gould. The study by the team at the University of Oxford's Big Data Institute and Nuffield Department of Medicinewas published in the journal Science,external. It proposes that an app would record people's GPS location data as they move about their daily lives. This would be supplemented by users scanning QR (quick response) codes posted to public amenities in places where a GPS signal is inadequate, as well as Bluetooth signals. If a person starts feeling ill, it is suggested they use the app to request a home test. And if it comes back positive for Covid-19, then an instant signal would be sent to everyone they had been in close contact with over recent days. Those people would be advised to self-isolate for a fortnight, but would not be told who had triggered the warning. In addition, the test subject's workplace and their transport providers could be told to carry out a decontamination clean-up. ""The constrictions that we're currently under place [many people] under severe strain,"" said the paper's co-lead Prof Christophe Fraser. ""Therefore if you have the ability with a bit more information and the use of an app to relax a lockdown, that could provide very substantial and direct benefits. ""Also I think a substantial number of lives can be saved."" To encourage take-up, it is suggested the app also acts as a hub for coronavirus-related health services and serves as a means to request food and medicine deliveries. The academics note that similar smartphone software has already been deployed in China. It was also voluntary there, but users were allowed to go into public spaces or on public transport only if they had installed it. EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? IN-DEPTH:Coronavirus pandemic One of the ethics specialists involved in the Oxford study said he did not think similar arrangements would be appropriate in the UK, but added that private enterprises might still impose restrictions. ""My favourite restaurant might ask me to show that I was low-risk before allowing me into a crowded place, and I think that would be a perfectly reasonable price to pay for this step towards returning to normal life,"" Prof Michael Parker told the BBC. He added that employers might also be justified in requiring staff to use the app if they worked ""in an old people's home, with vulnerable groups or [were based] in very crowded places"". And while he said that the general public should not be compelled to use the app to begin with, he did not rule this out if the majority failed to do so. ""The key question is - does it require everyone to do it for it to be effective?"" Prof Parker explained. ""It's not essential that everyone does... but perhaps a high proportion of the population needs to. ""This is a really unusual situation where lives are at risk, so there is a case to be made to make at least some actions compulsory - but there would need to be a really clear case for that and careful oversight."" The paper adds that the app could be updated to tackle the pandemic more aggressively if required. For example, it says, the stay-at-home alerts could be expanded to second or even third-degree contacts. And while the paper advocates the app being used in conjunction with home tests, Prof Fraser said his team was currently exploring whether it would still be effective if it relied on people using a questionnaire or 111 helpline advisers to diagnose the condition. NHS turns to big tech to tackle Covid-19 UK coronavirus app 'must respect privacy rights' NHS uses tech giants to plan crisis response He acknowledged some people might be wary of using the service, but hoped they would do so to ""save a lot of lives"". ""We already have tracking apps on our phones for more trivial tasks - the reason we have live traffic information is because we allow the people that provide the mapping service to track us,"" he said. ""What we're suggesting here is essentially sharing anonymised information [to] put to good use."" We know that the UK is preparing to roll out its own contact-tracing app and this paper by scientists who are close to the government reinforces what a vital role it could play. But it also shows why it may be a while before any app is rolled out. A key part of making the process by which people are informed that they have been in contact with someone infected with Covid-19 is the availability of testing. With only 11,000 tests a day available right now, most people who installed an app might find it of little use if they developed mild symptoms of the virus. Without a confirmed diagnosis, nothing would happen. The other concern is privacy. With the government wary of being seen as Big Brother, the app would need to convince users it wouldn't allow them to be spied on for ever more. Singapore's TraceTogether, which has been praised by privacy experts for collecting a bare minimum of data, could provide a template for the NHS app. Rather than constantly tracking people, it uses Bluetooth to record your proximity to other app users so that they can be alerted if you later test positive for the virus. But while the government will almost certainly make use of the app optional, the concern is that it could become essential for anyone wanting to return to normal life. What, for instance, is to stop pubs and restaurants demanding to see evidence of your Covid status before allowing you in? When the app does emerge, there will be a major marketing exercise behind it to convince as many people as possible to install it.  It will only be effective if a good proportion of the population are persuaded that it will help the UK beat the virus - and let them leave home and get back to work.

Singapore's TraceTogether, which has been praised by privacy experts for collecting a bare minimum of data, could provide a template for the NHS app. Rather than constantly tracking people, it uses Bluetooth to record your proximity to other app users so that they can be alerted if you later test positive for the virus. But while the government will almost certainly make use of the app optional, the concern is that it could become essential for anyone wanting to return to normal life. What, for instance, is to stop pubs and restaurants demanding to see evidence of your Covid status before allowing you in? When the app does emerge, there will be a major marketing exercise behind it to convince as many people as possible to install it.  It will only be effective if a good proportion of the population are persuaded that it will help the UK beat the virus - and let them leave home and get back to work.

"There is more data for London than some of the other UK cities Air pollution has started to fall in many UK cities in response to the lockdown measures introduced as a result of the coronavirus crisis. The trend mirrors that seen across continental Europe as people have spent less time in vehicles, offices and factories and more time at home. Data collected by the National Centre for Atmospheric Science shows marked reductions in nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and in particulate matter (PM2.5). And the falls look set to continue. ""If you look at traffic volumes, they're still going down. And so we probably haven't reached the bottom yet,"" said Prof Ally Lewis, director of science at the NCAS. ""A few days ago, we were talking about journeys by car going down by about a third, and now it's nearly a 50-60% reduction. So, it's possible if transport keeps declining, the signal we detect could get even larger,"" he told BBC News. Lockdowns continue to suppress European pollution Across the board in the 10 cities, small particulate matter is down NCAS has produced a set of graphics,externalthat compare air pollution levels for 15 February to 24 March with an average over the last five years. The 10 cities considered are Birmingham, Belfast, Bristol, Cardiff, Glasgow, Leeds, London, Manchester, Newcastle, York. For PM2.5, which comes from a range of sources but which includes tailpipes, every city has experienced a dip. For NO2, another key vehicle emission, it's the same picture - apart from Belfast and York. But Prof Lewis cautions that this may simply be the result of more limited monitoring stations at these locations. ""In London, we have a lot of data we can aggregate together,"" he explained. ""In some of the smaller cities and towns, there may be only one monitor and the data can get a little noisy. But when you see a consistent picture across multiple cities at multiple monitoring sites then you do know that something real is happening."" Last week, the Dutch Met Office (KNMI) released an analysis of satellite data collected over Europe to illustrate the suppression in pollution. The agency, however, omitted the UK from this assessment, in part because the UK lockdown began after many other countries began theirs, but also because it didn't think there was sufficient quality data. If the skies are cloudy, it frustrates the observations of spacecraft. A persistent problem in the UK. The NCAS information, on the other hand, comes solely from ground stations. NO2: Belfast and York appear to show an increase, but this may be just an issue of data density What will be interesting to see now is whether other pollutants follow the lead of NO2 and PM2.5. Volatile Organic Compounds, or VOCs, are an irritant, too. These come from solvents. They're in everything from inkjet printers and paints to glues and household cleaning products. It's unclear if their levels might change over the course of the lockdown. Ozone, another respiratory irritant, has climbed in many places - the highest levels seen in five years for this time of year. Ozone formation at ground level is dependent on some very complex chemical reactions which, in the absence of certain exhaust gases, will give a boost to the three-atom oxygen molecule in the air. A plot of ozone on London's Marylebone Road, clearly showing a sudden jump What will happen to ammonia emissions coming from agriculture? Farming could well proceed as normal, or as near to normal, through the Covid-19 crisis. Scientists will be watching the behaviour of all these different pollutants very closely. In an unexpected way, the coronavirus situation offers something of a policy experiment to test realistic targets for clean air in the coming decade. ""What we're doing is essentially looking into the future when we don't have diesel cars because we plan to take them off the roads. This summer may tell us what level of PM2.5, for example, is likely to be achievable in the big cities such as central London or central Birmingham,"" Prof Lewis said. And Edinburgh University's Prof Paul Palmer, whose group hasan interactive tool,externalto follow the behaviour of the various polluting species, told BBC News: ""What we are unintentionally witnessing is an analogue of what we might expect in future cities when we rely more on cleaner electric cars."" Environmental Audit Committee Chairman, Philip Dunne MP, commented: ""Coronavirus is not only having an unprecedented impact on how we live our lives, but also how pollution levels around the world are falling as a result of the global shutdown. ""The government has committed to a low-carbon future, and the Environmental Audit Committee will look to explore how we can avoid going straight back to dangerous levels of pollution once this is all over."" The European Union'sCopernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS),external, based at the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) in Reading, has also launched amicrosite,externalto track air quality through the Covid-19 shutdown. The CAMS analyses have a spatial resolution of 10km x 10km and combine over 1,000 surface observations across Europe.

"Some of the UK's biggest banks have agreed to scrap dividend payments and hold onto the cash, which may be needed during the coronavirus crisis. The Bank of England welcomed the decision to suspend the payments to shareholders and urged the banks not to pay bonuses to senior staff either. The banks, which include NatWest, Santander and Barclays, were due to pay out billions to shareholders. But in recent days they have come under pressure to hold onto the money. The deputy governor of the Bank of England, Sam Woods, wrote to some banking bosses asking them to suspend dividend payments. He asked them to confirm their decision by Tuesday evening. In a statement, the Prudential Regulation Authority, which is part of the Bank of England, said: ""Although the decisions taken today will result in shareholders not receiving dividends, they are a sensible precautionary step given the unique role that banks need to play in supporting the wider economy through a period of economic disruption."" Between them, Lloyds, Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays, HSBC and Standard Chartered were expected to pay a total of Â£15.6bn to shareholders, according to analysis from investment firm AJ Bell. But they will now retain those funds and not pay out any money to shareholders until at least the end of the year, which the Bank of England said ""should help the banks support the economy through 2020"". A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash Many economists are predicting that the UK, in common with other large economies, will enter a recession this year, with output set to plummet. Last week,a closely-watched early indicator of economic activity,externalfell to its lowest ever reading. That led economists at Capital Economics to predict a 15% contraction in the UK's economy during the second quarter of the year. Stephen Jones, chief executive for UK finance, the trade body for banks and finance companies, told the Today programme that banks were considering scrapping dividends before the Bank of England mandated it. ""It's very prudent for banks to be retaining capital rather than distributing it in the current environment,"" he said. Losses will increase on existing loans, he said, meaning lenders need a bigger buffer to protect deposits and keep the bank running. ""It's important that the banks are given as much firepower as they can to support the economy,"" he added. However, the Bank said it did not expect the cash to be needed, noting that the banks had more than enough money in reserve to deal with both a global recession and a shock in the financial markets. Shareholders in Barclays had been due to share Â£1bn in dividends on Friday Banks were criticised during the financial crisis 12 years ago when they paid dividends months before needing the biggest bailouts in history. Since then, banks have been forced to hold more capital to prevent the need for more public money to be spent on them, although not all banks have fully recovered.  The government still owns 62% of Royal Bank of Scotland, for example. Barclays' investors will be the first to be affected by the halting of dividends. Its shareholders had been due to share a payment of more than Â£1bn on Friday. Barclays chairman Nigel Higgins said suspending the payment was a ""difficult decision"". ""The bank has a strong capital base, but we think it is right and prudent, for the many businesses and people that we support, to take these steps now, and ensure that Barclays is well placed to continue doing what we can to help through this crisis,"" he added. UK consumers are protected up to Â£85,000 per bank under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.  In other words, if a bank collapses, savers will get any money in these accounts up to Â£85,000 paid back in compensation. Joint accounts have a protection level of Â£170,000. This is a significant move from the commercial banks. They decided not to pay shareholders several billion pounds worth of dividends after receiving a firmly-worded letter from the Bank of England, which wants the banks to hold on to the money to support lending in the economy. And, with some of the payments due to be made in just days, the impact will be felt almost immediately by some shareholders. The Bank of England's watchdog, the Prudential Regulation Authority, also made clear that it does not expect any of the UK commercial banks to pay cash bonuses either, although that is yet to be agreed. The logic here is to preserve cash for where it is needed, but the regulator has also been making the point that this crisis is a moment of potential redemption for the sector. The banks have the opportunity to distance themselves from the financial crisis, which they created, to become the economic saviours of the coronavirus crisis. But that depends on them preserving cashflow, overdrafts and funding lines to businesses that will become viable again once the pandemic passes. For example, the chancellor's freelance worker scheme will result in substantial cash sums being deposited in bank accounts, but not until June, and much depends on banks keeping workers financially afloat until then. The cancellation of dividends also piles on the pressure for other sectors that have received money for furloughing workers - or even more direct government backing - to also consider scrapping their dividend payouts. ""These are difficult decisions, not least in terms of the immediate impact they will have on shareholders,"" said Barclays chairman Nigel Higgins. ""The bank has a strong capital base, but we think it is right and prudent, for the many businesses and people that we support, to take these steps now, and ensure that Barclays is well placed to continue doing what we can to help through this crisis.""

"This video can not be played Michael Gove: The first of thousands of new ventilators will be delivered to the NHS next week The UK must go ""further, faster"" to ramp up its testing capacity for coronavirus, Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove has said. The government has set a target of carrying out 25,000 tests a day - but that will not be met until the end of April. Mr Gove said there was a global shortage of the chemicals needed to test patients. More than 8,000 patients were tested on Monday. Speaking at the government's daily coronavirus briefing, Mr Gove said: ""More NHS staff are returning to the front line, and more testing is taking place to help those self-isolating come back, and to protect those working so hard in our hospitals and in social care. ""But while the rate of testing is increasing, we must go further, faster."" He added that a ""critical constraint"" on the ability to increase testing capacity was the availability of the chemicals needed to test patients. ""We are working with companies worldwide to ensure that we get the material we need to increase tests of all kinds,"" he said. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash His comments come amid mounting criticism about the inability of some health staff to get tests. The Royal College of Physicians has said as many as a quarter of doctors are off work because they are having to self-isolate - either because they are showing symptoms or a member of their household is. A fifth of nurses have been affected, the Royal College of Nursing said, while the British Medical Association said staff began being tested over the weekend, but only in low numbers. How to understand the coronavirus death toll Is the NHS ready for the surge in coronavirus cases? BMA chairman Dr Chaand Nagpaul said: ""It's been well over two weeks since the government said it was going to roll out priority testing for healthcare staff. ""But many doctors still have no idea about where or how they can get tested."" Meanwhile, an A&E nurse who did not want to be named told the BBC: ""Staff are not being tested, and protective clothing is limited. ""It does feel unnerving. Our team is very strong at work and our matron has said no staff are to go near patients if we don't have the protective clothing. ""The protective clothing comes in daily but we are going through it so fast that it becomes limited by the end of the day."" Later in the briefing, Mr Gove said the UK was working to secure more ventilators, including buying them from EU nations and placing orders at home. The first ""of thousands"" of new ventilator devices would roll off the production line this weekend and be delivered to the NHS next week, he said. It comes asthe biggest daily increasein the number of people who have died with coronavirus in the UK - 381 - was reported. As of 17:00 BST on Monday, the total number of UK deaths linked to the virus was 1,789. But NHS England medical director Prof Stephen Powis said there were still some ""green shoots"". He said there was a ""bit of a plateau"" in the number of new cases, despite the total rising to more than 25,000 cases overall. Earlier in the epidemic the number of cases was doubling every three days, but the rate of increase is lower than that now. These are largely just the cases diagnosed in hospital as people with mild illnesses in the community are not being tested. But Prof Powis added: ""It's really important not to read too much into this. ""It's early days, we're not out of the woods, we're very much in the woods. ""The number of infections is not rising as rapidly as it once was. ""So green shoots, but only green shoots and we must not be complacent and we must not take our foot off the pedal."" He also said there was still ""headroom"" in the NHS to treat patients despite the rising number of cases. A drive-in coronavirus test centre for NHS workers has opened at Ikea's Wembley store, in north-west London Some 10,767 people are currently in hospital in England, but Prof Powis said even in London, which has seen the most cases at 3,915, there were still beds free thanks to the increase in intensive care capacity. The number of beds have been doubled to 1,400 with more due to open later this week when NHS Nightingale - the field hospital at the Excel Centre in east London - starts accepting patients. Elsewhere in England, the Midlands is also starting to see a rising number of admissions with 1,918 currently in hospital, Prof Powis said. Mr Gove described the sharp rise in the latest reported UK deaths linked to coronavirus as ""deeply shocking"" but he could not say exactly when the peak of the epidemic would come. ""There's not a fixed date like Easter when you know that the peak will come, it depends on the actions of all of us,"" he said. He added that ""now is absolutely not the time for people to imagine there can be any relaxation or slackening"" of lockdown measures.

"Major events such as the London Marathon, which has been cancelled, are big earners for charities Charities are expecting to lose around a third of their income over the next three months due to the coronavirus outbreak, MPs have been told. Karl Wilding, chief executive of the National Council for Voluntary Organisations, said his group has been âinundated with calls for helpâ. MPs heard voluntary organisations needed âsubstantialâ government support to shore up their finances. PM Boris Johnson has promised a âpackage of measuresâ for the sector. The Treasury has also said charities will be able to defer VAT bills for three months, and many charity shops will qualify for ayear-long holiday on business rates. Charities can also apply for the government scheme that grants firms cash topay 80% of the wages of stafffurloughed on temporary leave. Treasury trebles monthly borrowing plans for virus Coronavirus: Who will pay my wages if I can't work? What help will self-employed people get? Mr Wilding told the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee he estimated charities would lose around Â£4bn of a predicted Â£12.5bn income in the next financial quarter due to a loss of trading income. He said only a quarter of charities had reserves that could see them through the next three months, while social distancing rules aimed at stopping the spread of the virus had made traditional fundraising events such as marathons impossible. The crisis faced by charities now is more serious than after the 2008 financial crisis, when they got a Â£40m bailout, he added â noting that the sector today is bigger and more involved in delivering public services. Mr Wilding said it was welcome charities would be eligible for thegovernment furlough scheme,external, but it would only be an option for up to a third of charities. Putting staff on leave, he told MPs, was the âlast thingâ that charities involved in the fight against the virus would be able to do, due to increased demand. âMothballing staff when demand is increasing is the opposition of what you need to do â we need to mobilise them,â he added. EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? IN-DEPTH:Coronavirus pandemic Martin Houghton-Brown, chief executive of St John Ambulance, told the committee the Treasury would need to âstep upâ and help charities responding to the virus. He said the charity, which is providing volunteers for the Nightingale hospitals dealing with Covid-19 patients, needed an extra Â£450,000 a week to continue going throughout the crisis. He added that despite some generous private donations, as things stand it will need to borrow heavily against its assets to keep going beyond August. He also warned that it would prove âimpossibleâ to resume Premier League football games without the first aid volunteers it provides at matches. Last week 100 MPs and peers from seven different political parties called on the government to provide extra support for charities. Labour MP Stephen Doughty, who wrote the letter, called for emergency help and backed the idea of a ""stabilisation fundâ for voluntary organisations. The Treasury has said it recognises some charities are facing difficult decisions and do not want to stop services when they are most needed. As well as the support on business rates and VAT, charities which raise at least half their income from trading will be eligible to apply for government loans from a Â£330bn scheme, the department has said.

"This video can not be played Michael Gove: The first of thousands of new ventilators will be delivered to the NHS next week The UK must go ""further, faster"" to ramp up its testing capacity for coronavirus, Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove has said. The government has set a target of carrying out 25,000 tests a day - but that will not be met until the end of April. Mr Gove said there was a global shortage of the chemicals needed to test patients. More than 8,000 patients were tested on Monday. Speaking at the government's daily coronavirus briefing, Mr Gove said: ""More NHS staff are returning to the front line, and more testing is taking place to help those self-isolating come back, and to protect those working so hard in our hospitals and in social care. ""But while the rate of testing is increasing, we must go further, faster."" He added that a ""critical constraint"" on the ability to increase testing capacity was the availability of the chemicals needed to test patients. ""We are working with companies worldwide to ensure that we get the material we need to increase tests of all kinds,"" he said. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash His comments come amid mounting criticism about the inability of some health staff to get tests. The Royal College of Physicians has said as many as a quarter of doctors are off work because they are having to self-isolate - either because they are showing symptoms or a member of their household is. A fifth of nurses have been affected, the Royal College of Nursing said, while the British Medical Association said staff began being tested over the weekend, but only in low numbers. How to understand the coronavirus death toll Is the NHS ready for the surge in coronavirus cases? BMA chairman Dr Chaand Nagpaul said: ""It's been well over two weeks since the government said it was going to roll out priority testing for healthcare staff. ""But many doctors still have no idea about where or how they can get tested."" Meanwhile, an A&E nurse who did not want to be named told the BBC: ""Staff are not being tested, and protective clothing is limited. ""It does feel unnerving. Our team is very strong at work and our matron has said no staff are to go near patients if we don't have the protective clothing. ""The protective clothing comes in daily but we are going through it so fast that it becomes limited by the end of the day."" Later in the briefing, Mr Gove said the UK was working to secure more ventilators, including buying them from EU nations and placing orders at home. The first ""of thousands"" of new ventilator devices would roll off the production line this weekend and be delivered to the NHS next week, he said. It comes asthe biggest daily increasein the number of people who have died with coronavirus in the UK - 381 - was reported. As of 17:00 BST on Monday, the total number of UK deaths linked to the virus was 1,789. But NHS England medical director Prof Stephen Powis said there were still some ""green shoots"". He said there was a ""bit of a plateau"" in the number of new cases, despite the total rising to more than 25,000 cases overall. Earlier in the epidemic the number of cases was doubling every three days, but the rate of increase is lower than that now. These are largely just the cases diagnosed in hospital as people with mild illnesses in the community are not being tested. But Prof Powis added: ""It's really important not to read too much into this. ""It's early days, we're not out of the woods, we're very much in the woods. ""The number of infections is not rising as rapidly as it once was. ""So green shoots, but only green shoots and we must not be complacent and we must not take our foot off the pedal."" He also said there was still ""headroom"" in the NHS to treat patients despite the rising number of cases. A drive-in coronavirus test centre for NHS workers has opened at Ikea's Wembley store, in north-west London Some 10,767 people are currently in hospital in England, but Prof Powis said even in London, which has seen the most cases at 3,915, there were still beds free thanks to the increase in intensive care capacity. The number of beds have been doubled to 1,400 with more due to open later this week when NHS Nightingale - the field hospital at the Excel Centre in east London - starts accepting patients. Elsewhere in England, the Midlands is also starting to see a rising number of admissions with 1,918 currently in hospital, Prof Powis said. Mr Gove described the sharp rise in the latest reported UK deaths linked to coronavirus as ""deeply shocking"" but he could not say exactly when the peak of the epidemic would come. ""There's not a fixed date like Easter when you know that the peak will come, it depends on the actions of all of us,"" he said. He added that ""now is absolutely not the time for people to imagine there can be any relaxation or slackening"" of lockdown measures.

"This video can not be played WATCH: Why Oxford University experts are urging the rollout of a coronavirus app A coronavirus app that alerts people if they have recently been in contact with someone testing positive for the virus ""could play a critical role"" in limiting lockdowns, scientists advising the government have said. The location-tracking tech would enable a week's worth of manual detective work to be done in an instant, they say. But the academics say no-one should be forced to enrol - at least initially. UK health chiefs have confirmed they are exploring the idea. ""NHSX is looking at whether app-based solutions might be helpful in tracking and managing coronavirus, and we have assembled expertise from inside and outside the organisation to do this as rapidly as possible,"" said the tech-focused division's chief Matthew Gould. The study by the team at the University of Oxford's Big Data Institute and Nuffield Department of Medicinewas published in the journal Science,external. It proposes that an app would record people's GPS location data as they move about their daily lives. This would be supplemented by users scanning QR (quick response) codes posted to public amenities in places where a GPS signal is inadequate, as well as Bluetooth signals. If a person starts feeling ill, it is suggested they use the app to request a home test. And if it comes back positive for Covid-19, then an instant signal would be sent to everyone they had been in close contact with over recent days. Those people would be advised to self-isolate for a fortnight, but would not be told who had triggered the warning. In addition, the test subject's workplace and their transport providers could be told to carry out a decontamination clean-up. ""The constrictions that we're currently under place [many people] under severe strain,"" said the paper's co-lead Prof Christophe Fraser. ""Therefore if you have the ability with a bit more information and the use of an app to relax a lockdown, that could provide very substantial and direct benefits. ""Also I think a substantial number of lives can be saved."" To encourage take-up, it is suggested the app also acts as a hub for coronavirus-related health services and serves as a means to request food and medicine deliveries. The academics note that similar smartphone software has already been deployed in China. It was also voluntary there, but users were allowed to go into public spaces or on public transport only if they had installed it. EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? IN-DEPTH:Coronavirus pandemic One of the ethics specialists involved in the Oxford study said he did not think similar arrangements would be appropriate in the UK, but added that private enterprises might still impose restrictions. ""My favourite restaurant might ask me to show that I was low-risk before allowing me into a crowded place, and I think that would be a perfectly reasonable price to pay for this step towards returning to normal life,"" Prof Michael Parker told the BBC. He added that employers might also be justified in requiring staff to use the app if they worked ""in an old people's home, with vulnerable groups or [were based] in very crowded places"". And while he said that the general public should not be compelled to use the app to begin with, he did not rule this out if the majority failed to do so. ""The key question is - does it require everyone to do it for it to be effective?"" Prof Parker explained. ""It's not essential that everyone does... but perhaps a high proportion of the population needs to. ""This is a really unusual situation where lives are at risk, so there is a case to be made to make at least some actions compulsory - but there would need to be a really clear case for that and careful oversight."" The paper adds that the app could be updated to tackle the pandemic more aggressively if required. For example, it says, the stay-at-home alerts could be expanded to second or even third-degree contacts. And while the paper advocates the app being used in conjunction with home tests, Prof Fraser said his team was currently exploring whether it would still be effective if it relied on people using a questionnaire or 111 helpline advisers to diagnose the condition. NHS turns to big tech to tackle Covid-19 UK coronavirus app 'must respect privacy rights' NHS uses tech giants to plan crisis response He acknowledged some people might be wary of using the service, but hoped they would do so to ""save a lot of lives"". ""We already have tracking apps on our phones for more trivial tasks - the reason we have live traffic information is because we allow the people that provide the mapping service to track us,"" he said. ""What we're suggesting here is essentially sharing anonymised information [to] put to good use."" We know that the UK is preparing to roll out its own contact-tracing app and this paper by scientists who are close to the government reinforces what a vital role it could play. But it also shows why it may be a while before any app is rolled out. A key part of making the process by which people are informed that they have been in contact with someone infected with Covid-19 is the availability of testing. With only 11,000 tests a day available right now, most people who installed an app might find it of little use if they developed mild symptoms of the virus. Without a confirmed diagnosis, nothing would happen. The other concern is privacy. With the government wary of being seen as Big Brother, the app would need to convince users it wouldn't allow them to be spied on for ever more. Singapore's TraceTogether, which has been praised by privacy experts for collecting a bare minimum of data, could provide a template for the NHS app. Rather than constantly tracking people, it uses Bluetooth to record your proximity to other app users so that they can be alerted if you later test positive for the virus. But while the government will almost certainly make use of the app optional, the concern is that it could become essential for anyone wanting to return to normal life. What, for instance, is to stop pubs and restaurants demanding to see evidence of your Covid status before allowing you in? When the app does emerge, there will be a major marketing exercise behind it to convince as many people as possible to install it.  It will only be effective if a good proportion of the population are persuaded that it will help the UK beat the virus - and let them leave home and get back to work.

"People queueing outside a supermarket Aldi, Morrisons, Waitrose and Asda are easing restrictions on some of their products which were imposed in the wake of stockpiling earlier this month. All the major supermarkets restricted customers to buying fixed numbers of individual items to keep shelves full. Aldi is now scrapping limits completely on all but a few items, while Morrisons, Waitrose and Asda  have also removed some limits and changed others. Meanwhile, grocery sales in the UK were at record levels in March. Aldi customers will be able to buy as many as they want of most items in its stores. However, they will only be allowed to purchase four of some - including hand wash and soap, toilet roll, certain canned goods and alcohol - and  two of antibacterial hand gel, UHT milk and baby formula. Morrisons is upping the limits on some items from three to four per customer and removing some altogether to make it easier for people to donate to food banks. The supermarket will create local drop-off points for customers to donate products to others and will distribute Â£10m of food to food banks itself. How are supermarkets keeping customers safe? Supermarkets 'drastically' cutting product ranges Waitrose is removing its cap on all fresh food, so meat, fish, poultry and other fresh goods can now be purchased freely along with fruit and vegetables. Alcohol and Easter confectionery are also not subject to limits, although restrictions do remain on certain items. Asda is removing limits on fruit and vegetables and chilled products. Tesco, Sainsbury's and Co-op are not changing their policies on restrictions at the moment. Meanwhile, figures from consumer analysts Kantar showed huge increases in shopping in the UK this month. The busiest spell was from 16-19 March, when 88% of households visited a food store, adding up to 42 million extra trips across four days. In the last four weeks, year-on-year supermarket sales grew by 20.6%. Kantar's Fraser McKevitt said Â£10.8bn sales in the past four weeks were ""even higher than levels seen at Christmas"". The figures have mainly risen because of people making extra shopping trips, rather than spending more on each visit. The average household spent an extra Â£62.92 during the past four weeks, equivalent to adding five days' worth of groceries. London had the biggest increase, with grocery spending up by 26% during the month. EASY STEPS:What can I do? CONTAINMENT:What it means to self-isolate UK LATEST:What's the UK's plan and what could happen next? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash Mr McKevitt added: ""It's inevitable that shoppers will add extra items to their baskets when faced with restrictions on their movement. ""With restaurants and cafes now closed, none of us can eat meals on the go any longer and an extra 503 million meals, mainly lunches and snacks, will be prepared and eaten at home every week for the foreseeable future."" Online grocery spending was 13% higher than in the same period last year. The average online basket cost Â£81.88, which was Â£6 more than in March 2019, while 14.6% of households received an online delivery - up from 13.8% at the same time last year. Sales of alcohol rose by 22% - an extra Â£199m. There was also a rise in spending for families with children over the age of 16, which is likely to be down to the youngsters returning early from college or university. Those families spent Â£508 on average on groceries in March, Â£88.13 more than they did in the same month last year. Supermarket spending data from analysts Nielsen showed that in the week ending 21 March, many shoppers had filled their cupboards and instead were deciding to stock up the freezer. Its figures showed that sales of frozen food that week rose by 84% compared with the same period last year. Nielsen's Mike Watkins said there had been a ""seismic shift in overall shopping patterns"". He added: ""Unlike stores, there is a finite capacity for online grocery shopping, due to warehouse capacity and available delivery slots, and this will have limited the growth of online sales."" Online deliveries have been a sticking point for many people, who have found themselves unable to book slots and followPrime Minister Boris Johnson's request to use online deliveriesand stay at home. Tesco, which last weeklimited online orders to 80 items only,has now expanded its home delivery and click and collect services to about 780,000 slots this week - up from 660,000 two weeks ago. It has plans to add another 100,000 slots in the coming weeks. It has also recruited more than 7,500 staff and added more than 200 new vans to its fleet. Asda is also recruiting more delivery drivers, while Sainsbury's has introduced priority slots for elderly and vulnerable customers and is contacting eligible customers on its database. Morrisons is creating 3,500 new jobs to help expand its online delivery service, while Waitrose says it will set aside at least a quarter of its delivery slots to elderly or vulnerable people and is working to identify eligible customers.

"The police's role in the coronavirus pandemic is simple: to ensure we follow national lockdown restrictions. But in practice, that is a huge challenge for officers who are being asked to monitor behaviour that, until March last year, was perfectly legal. Police chiefs have followed a system called ""The Four Es"". Before fines are issued to rule-breakers, police will first: Engage with people, to ask why they appear to be breaking the rules Explain the law, stressing the risks to public health and the NHS Encourage them to change their behaviour The fourth ""E"" is ""Enforce"" by issuing penalty notices, as a last resort. Covid rule-breakers are now ""increasingly likely"" to be finedby officers, the Metropolitan Police commissioner Dame Cressida Dick has said. The police have a legal duty to make sure the rules are enforced, alongside council, environmental health and trading standards officers. Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live If you break coronavirus regulations, you could get a fixed penalty notice , the Covid equivalent of a traffic offence like speeding. Since March, 32,000 have been issued in England and Wales. Penalties rose sharply during England's November lockdown. Almost 6,500 penalty tickets were handed out as police moved more quickly to enforcement. In England and Northern Ireland fines start at Â£200. Fines start at Â£60in Wales,external, andin Scotland,external, although this is reduced to Â£30 if paid within 28 days. Large parties can also be shut down by the police - with fines of up to Â£10,000. In extreme circumstances, you could be prosecuted and face an even greater fine imposed by a court. Hundreds of people were caught on a drone camera at an illegal party by West Midlands Police Yes. All of England is now in a ""tier four"" national lockdown, with similar measures in place across the rest of the UK. Under the new lockdown law, you must stay at home unless you have a ""reasonable excuse"" to be outside. Your home includes property such as a garden, shed or garage - and also access to it. The government's lockdown guidance sets outexamples of reasonable excuses,external. Police won't fine you for leaving home to go shopping for essential goods, or to use a business that can remain open, or for going to work or education, training or childcare. There are other reasonable excuses - such as helping other people in their moment of need. Police chiefs are telling frontline officers to use their judgement if they come across a situation not defined in the regulations. If you want to take part in a protest, the law does not define that as a reasonable excuse to leave home. There is, however, an exception for joining a picket as part of lawful industrial action. Exercise is one of the reasonable excuses for being outside in a public space. You cannot be fined for exercising. But there has been enormous confusion since last March over how long people could exercise for. Cabinet Minister Michael Gove pronounced that spring that he thought half an hour was enough. There are also questions over how far you can go to exercise. Boris Johnson has beencriticised for travelling seven miles from Downing Streetto go cycling during lockdown. There are no restrictions in law in England on how you exercise and for how long. You cannot exercise in groups, but you can run or go on a wander with someone else from your household, support bubble or one person you don't live with. The government's Covid guidance for exercise explains that law - andmixes it with a non-legal recommendation,externalto only go out once a day - and to stay local. It says local ""means stay in the village, town, or part of the city where you live"", but that has no legal force. Derbyshire Police have been taking the ""stay local"" principle seriously. Officers have issued tickets to people who drive five miles to their local beauty spot - includingtwo women accused of an illegal picnicbecause they were carrying takeaway cups of tea. They might. This refers to the ban on ""gatherings"". The last-but-one version of the restrictions made it a potential crime to ""mingle"". That language has now gone from the law - but the rules are far stricter. While the law in England doesn't criminalise bumping into someone in the street, you can no longer meet anyone socially - other than those in your household, support bubble or people you care for. The Home Office has given the police an extra Â£30m to pay for Covid patrols in England and Wales. Over Christmas there were more than 800 fines for what Home Secretary Priti Patel says were ""egregious"" breaches of the rules. The National Police Chiefs' Council hasn't abandoned the Four Es - but expect more fines and more officers asking people what they are doing. Leicester woman fined for Wales trip to see horse Group fined for playing dominoes in restaurant Border police patrols to double after travel ban Police patrols were stepped up around the Scotland-England border around Christmas For instance, the Metropolitan Police has told officers to issue fines ""more quickly"" to anyone committing obvious, wilful and serious breaches. Derbyshire Police, who famouslyput a drone up over hikersin the first lockdown, has issued a similar warning. Yes - while in shops and on public transport. You could face a fixed penalty notice if you don't. What are the rules for face masks or face coverings? If you have returned from an overseas Covid hotspot, or have been told by the NHS Test and Trace system to stay at home, you must quarantine for 10 days. The police can now check the NHS Test and Trace database to investigate a tip-off about a quarantine-breaker. Police won't get to see your personal health records.

"Have you been thinking about getting a mortgage? You're going to need to think again as lenders are scrapping their home loan deals. On Tuesday, Nationwide - one of the UK's biggest lenders - effectively pulled out of new deals. Others are doing the same as the home mortgage market goes into lockdown amid the coronavirus which has brought the economy to a virtual standstill. Nationwide will now only offer home loans to those with 25% equity or more. It rules out first-time borrowers or existing homeowners with little equity in their home. Banks to allow customers to defer mortgage payments Coronavirus: How the interest rate cuts affect you Nationwide said the change will not impact existing applications. In fact it will allow it to ""focus on supporting existing mortgage members, while continuing to process ongoing applications"", it said. The mutual's existing mortgage customers will still be offered mortgage deals of up to 95% loan to value (LTV), it added. Nationwide blamed ""an extremely high number of enquiries about existing mortgages and ongoing applications"". ""That is why we have taken this decision on a temporary basis although, by continuing to offer home loans up to 75% LTV, we can continue supporting the housing market,"" it said. Other lenders that have taken similar action include Santander and Skipton Building Society but many have gone further, by reducing the loan-to-value ratio to 60%. That means borrowers will need a 40% deposit or equity in their home to be able to get a mortgage. Lenders that have done this include Barclays, Halifax, Virgin Money and The Family Building Society, while the Coventry Building Society has cut its LTV ratio to 65%. ""The recent withdrawal of many higher LTV mortgage products and home purchase products is hopefully a temporary measure while lenders reassess risk in this area of the market and work out what it will be possible for them to offer while the current restrictions are in place,"" said Eleanor Williams, finance Expert at Moneyfacts.co.uk. ""With so much uncertainty at the moment, providers seem to initially be focusing on the support that their existing customers may need in the coming weeks."" Nationwide has increase the deposit it requires for a new mortgage Chris Sykes, mortgage consultant at broker Private Finance, reckons there are good reasons for the changes. ""Lenders are having to work at a lower capacity because of staff being off and having to deal with thousands of calls for mortgage payment holidays,"" he said. ""So they don't really have the capacity to do a lot of new mortgages right now. If they are going to do any, they want high-quality low-risk mortgages."" It is also worth bearing in mind that valuers cannot get out to see properties right now which will affect more complex property purchases, he added. ""Lower loan-to-value loans means there's more likeliness of an online or automated valuation,"" he said. That won't be affected. Lenders say they will carry on with home loans already agreed. Nationwide said: ""Existing applications, where a product has already been reserved, will continue to progress."" For people who've already made offers but who may have been affected by Covid-19, lenders are offering extra protection for people. They will give customers who have exchanged contracts the option to extend their mortgage offer for up to three months to allow them to move at a later date. ""Lenders and borrowers face an unprecedented set of circumstances,"" said Robin Fieth, chief executive of the Building Societies Association. He pointed out that people who would have been preparing and expecting to move house in the coming weeks now face a wait until Covid-19 restrictions can be lifted. He said: ""Our hearts go out to them and our heads are clear that it would be unfair for these people to have to start their mortgage application all over again once life returns to a more normal state. ""A three-month extension of existing mortgage offers seems a fair and reasonable step to take."" âMy dream home hangs in the balanceâ Mortgage holidays offered amid coronavirus outbreak Budget: 'First-time buyers need more help' Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Locals find homes reduced to ash as fears grow of more fierce winds spreading LA fires Climate 'whiplash' linked to raging LA fires Watch: The moment five US presidents gather at Jimmy Carter's funeral The '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty.

"This video can not be played Grounded planes can be seen at airports around the country British Airways will suspend all flights to and from London's Gatwick airport amid a collapse in demand due to the coronavirus. It follows EasyJet's suspension of flights after the government advised against all but essential travel. British Airways told staff it was facing a challenging market environment in ""unprecedented circumstances"", according to an email seen by the BBC. The airline said it would contact customers to ""discuss their options"". ""Due to the considerable restrictions and challenging market environment, like many other airlines, we will temporarily suspend our flying schedule at Gatwick,"" the airline said in a statement. Why are planes still flying? EasyJet grounds entire fleet of planes due to virus Why are British travellers struggling to get home? Shares in IAG, which owns British Airways, have more than halved in value since the beginning of the month. Although its share price rose by 8.4% to 218.7p on Tuesday. While BA continues to fly from its main hub of Heathrow, it does so on a much reduced timetable as travellers scramble to make it back to the UK. EasyJet has grounded its entire fleet Yesterday, EasyJet grounded its entire fleet of planes and said it could not give a date for when they will restart. The international air transport association, IATA, says the crisis in the industry caused by the coronavirus outbreak will ""undoubtedly"" cause some airlines to collapse, while others will only begin to recover towards the end of the year. With severe travel restrictions in force in countries around the world, many airlines have had to suspend routes and ground large numbers of aircraft. because little money is coming in, except from cargo services, they are burning through their cash reserves. IATA expects them to run up collective losses of $39bn in the three months to the end of June, a figure described as devastating. Among the biggest costs they face is a potential $35bn bill for refunding tickets. BA, EasyJet and Virgin Atlantic are among airlines working with the government to fly Britons back to the UK. The government has also pledged Â£75m to charter special flights to bring home UK nationals from countries where commercial flights are unavailable. Aviation bosses have been lobbying the government for a targeted aid package to stop firms going under as a result of the slump in demand. If a passenger's flight has been cancelled they are entitled to a full refund to the original form of payment within seven days under EU air passengers' rights rules. However, airlines including BA have removed the usual option where passengers can request their money back online. Airlines want customers to take vouchers instead. Some airlines are concerned about their future if they have to repay passengers and do not receive help from the state. Virgin Atlantic is expected to seek state help in the coming days While they have been able to claim for staff wages under the government's Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, they may still be paying finance costs for their planes. Virgin Atlantic is expected to seek a bailoutin the coming days. On Tuesday, the Dubai government announced plans to inject fresh equity into Emirates to help the airline overcome the impact of coronavirus. The carrier suspended all passenger flights on 25 March for two weeks. Crown Prince Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed said Emirates has ""strategic importance to the Dubai and UAE economy"", adding that he will provide more details on the cash infusion ""at a later stage"". In the US, American Airlines has said it will seek $12bn (Â£9.7bn) of financial support from its government because of the impact of coronavirus. It said it would mean ""no involuntary furloughs or cuts in pay rates or benefits for the next six months"". The company returned $1.3bn to shareholders in dividends and buybacks last year, according to Bloomberg EasyJet grounds entire fleet of planes due to virus Why are planes still flying?

"In the space of a month, the United Kingdom has transformed beyond recognition. And most of us haven't had time to stop and take stock. One Friday afternoon, when the UK was another country, a chalkboard leaned against the outside wall of a country pub. A message had been written in neat, thin capital letters. ""Unfortunately a customer who visited us has tested positive for the coronavirus,"" it read. ""So as a precautionary measure we are closing for a full deep clean."" It was signed by the landlord and landlady, who apologised for the inconvenience. The pub was located along a quiet, narrow road just outside Haslemere in Surrey. The patient who had gone there lived somewhere in the county. Unlike previous British cases detected up to that point - he was the 20th - he hadn't been abroad recently. As far as anyone knew, he was the first to catch the virus inside the UK. On the same day, 28 February 2020, came another news update. A grimmer milestone. A British man who'd been infected on the Diamond Princess cruise ship became the first UK citizen to die, in Japan, from Covid-19. That afternoon, children were still in classrooms and adults were still at work. People shook hands and hugged and kissed. In the evening, they went to pubs and restaurants. Some went on dates and others visited elderly relatives. They assembled in groups and mingled with residents of other households. As the weekend went on, football fans crammed into stadiums. Worshippers gathered in churches, mosques, temples and synagogues. You could go outside for as long as you liked, if you didn't mind the rain. On supermarket shelves, toilet paper and paracetamol were plentiful. Recent storms had left large swathes of the country flooded, but for most British people, life went on as it always had and seemingly always would. Insofar as any of this describes a British way of life, though, it was one that ceased to exist entirely within just a few weeks. The changes didn't happen smoothly, in steady, barely noticeable steps. Instead, the UK's sense of what was normal shifted in sudden movements, as though a ratchet was being yanked. On 28 February 2020 people in the UK were already taking notice of the outbreak. It would have been difficult to ignore entirely the headlines about what was happening in China, South Korea, Iran and Italy. The first confirmed cases among travellers returning to the UK had come as early as January, but it still seemed possible to regard this as something happening, for the most part, a long way away. Not every newspaper front page that Friday morning led with Covid-19 - the Daily Mail splashed on the saga of Harry and Meghan, the Daily Express with Brexit talks - but most did. In the final week of the month 442,675 phone calls were made to the non-emergency NHS line 111. People weren't yet panicking, but a generalised sense of low-level anxiety was everywhere. By 1 March, the virus had reached the four corners of the United Kingdom - cases had been detected in England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Two days later, with the total number at 51, Prime Minister Boris Johnson stood behind a lectern and launched the government's Coronavirus Action Plan. The outbreak was declared a ""level four incident"". Up to a fifth of the workforce might be off sick at its peak, the prime ministerwarned. Schools might have to close and large-scale gatherings be reduced. However seriously anyone took the warning, it was still difficult to visualise. The following day, a woman in her 70s with an underlying condition - those last four words soon became grimly familiar to anyone who followed news bulletins - became the first person to die inside the UK after testing positive for the virus. The firstreports,externalof hand sanitiser selling out in supermarkets were published. Each day the number of confirmed cases crept up - 115 by 5 March, 206 by 7 March, 273 by 8 March. On 11 March, the day that the World Health Organization declared a pandemic, Liverpool FC hosted Atletico Madrid - who were already playing their home games behind closed doors. There were anxieties about whether it was a great idea to allow the 3,000 Spanish supporters to fly into a major British city where they would eat, drink, mingle and sleep. Anyone with plans to fly out of the UK was beginning to reconsider. Another twist of the ratchet was imminent. The following day, the government's Sage committee of scientific experts was shown revised modelling of the likely death toll. The figures,according to the Sunday Times,external, were ""shattering"". If nothing was done, there would be 510,000 deaths. Under the existing ""mitigation"" strategy - to shield the most vulnerable while letting everyone go about their business mostly as normal - there would be a quarter of a million. In a press conference, the prime minister told anyone with a continuous cough or a fever to self-isolate. His instruction came with a warning that ""many more families are going to lose loved ones before their time"". The bluntness was shocking. Some asked why, in that case, more wasn't being done. On Friday 13, the London Marathon, the Premier League and English Football League and May's local elections were all postponed. Scotland had its first coronavirus-related death. Saturday 14 and Sunday 15 March was the last relatively normal weekend. You couldn't watch league football but you could go to the pub. Hand sanitiser now wasn't to be found on any supermarket shelves, but you could tell your friends about your plans to practise ""social distancing"" if you met them on the street. Around the country, people looked at Italy, France and Spain, which had already gone into lockdown, and wondered if the UK was next. Volunteers began forming mutual aid groups to deliver food and medicine to vulnerable people who were self-isolating. In person and on WhatsApp, families and groups of friends argued about what it all meant. The more anxious wondered why the British government was moving more cautiously than its counterparts on the continent. The more blasÃ© complained about why they were going to all this bother. Wasn't it just a bit of flu? The latter sentiment was exactly the kind of thing the government's advisers were most worried about. On Monday 16, the prime minister advised against ""non-essential"" travel, urged people to avoid pubs and clubs and work from home. Across the country, kitchen tables were cleared to make way for laptops. Thanks to Skype and the virtual meetings app, Zoom, white-collar workers started getting a glimpse of their colleagues' interior decor. Those who couldn't do their jobs like this wondered how on Earth they were supposed to earn money and stay safe. On 17 March, the government began holding daily press conferences - events that would soon become regular viewing for nervous families. Just six days after presenting his budget, the Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, announced Â£300bn in loan guarantees - a huge expansion of state intervention in the economy by a Conservative government. There were still calls for more to be done to stop Britons infecting each other. The following day, most school pupils - those whose parents weren't designated key workers - were told they wouldn't go back to their classes until further notice. Exams, proms, farewells to classmates and teachers would now never happen. But although the UK had been told not to go to restaurants, cafes and pubs, many restaurants, cafes and pubs stayed open. They were quieter than usual but some customers still came. On the evening of Friday 20, the prime minister - who in a long career as a newspaper columnist had steadfastly demonstrated libertarian instincts - ordered restaurants, cafes and pubs to close, a measure that even in the darkest moments of World War Two would have been unthinkable. For much of the weekend that followed, there was bright sunshine, and people poured outside to take advantage of the last leisure option open to them. But when they crowded into parks and on to the summit of Snowdon they were seen - and widely condemned. This was not how ""social distancing"" - now regarded as everyone's social duty - was meant to operate. The lockdown was coming. On Monday 23 at 20:30, the television screens showed the prime minister sitting behind a desk. He was about to announce some of the most draconian restrictions on individual liberty the UK had ever seen. You could only leave home to exercise once a day, travel to and from work when absolutely necessary and only go shopping for essential items. You had to stand two metres apart from people you didn't live with. You weren't to gather in public in groups bigger than two. The British people were being told to avoid human contact when they needed it most. All through the following week, people would look forward to their one state-sanctioned form of outdoor exercise a day. Or they would stand in front of their laptops, following the instructions set by the fitness coach, Joe Wicks. By the time the weekend arrived, there were more than 537,000 confirmed cases in 175 countries. More than a quarter of all the people on the planet were living under some kind of restrictions in their social contact and movements. British life had been transformed so dramatically, and so fast, that you hadn't had time to dwell on it. On 28 February, London's Excel Centre had been hosting The Baby Show, ""the UK's largest parenting event"". A month later, the venue was a giant field hospital. This wasn't normal. Everything was described as ""unprecedented"" now, because it was. Speaking to the BBC's The World At One, historian Lord Peter Hennessy predicted that, in future, post-war Britain will be demarcated ""BC and AC - before corona and after corona"". Before 28 February, the UK was still widely portrayed as a place divided by Brexit, with younger, metropolitan Britons on one side, and their older counterparts in towns and the countryside on the other. That soon came to seem an anachronism. Elderly people were most at risk and those of working age, in the NHS and other key professions, were there to try and save them. Everyone was in this together. The framing of political debate since 2016 seemed inadequate to the new reality. Coronavirus would not be defeated by a populist attack on the elites. More than ever, the UK needed experts to lead the way. But the experts needed the masses, too - if the vast majority of the population didn't act, then Covid-19 couldn't be stopped. Initially, the lockdown was supposed to last three weeks. But a month on from 28 February, the UK is settling in for the long haul, with the prime minister, the health secretary and the first in line to the throne all having tested positive for the virus. You remember your last trip to the gym, the last drink you had in a cafe or a pub, the last time you hugged your mum or your grandad. You think about the life you once took for granted. You wonder if it will ever return. Follow@mrjonkelly,externalon Twitter Picture editor Emma Lynch A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms?

Some of the key developments from Tuesday:  Join us again on Wednesday when we'll be back to bring you the latest developments, updated analysis and key information to help you keep safe and healthy.  Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter A New Yorker waits outside a Brooklyn hospital to be tested There was no sugar-coating it this time. No optimistic talk of miracle cures or Easter-time business re-openings. There was just the cold, hard reality of the facts on the ground. âI want every American to be prepared for the hard days that lie ahead,â a grave-faced Donald Trump told the nation on Tuesday afternoon. ""This is going to be a very, very painful two weeks."" How painful? The number of deaths, based on current projections, is between 100,000 and 200,000. Mr Trump tried to frame this news as best he could, noting that the projections for US casualties if the government had done nothing were in the millions. âA lot of people were saying 'think of it as the flu', but itâs not the flu,â he said. âItâs vicious.â Of course, it was just a week ago the president himself was making exactly such comparisons, noting that the early fatality numbers were much less than those from the flu or even automobile accidents. Now, however, the seriousness of the situation has hit home. He spoke of checking in on a friend who was in the hospital with the virus -  ""a little older, and heâs heavy, but heâs tough person"" - only to find out he was now in a coma. âI spoke to some of my friends, and they canât believe what theyâre seeing,â he said.  Trumpâs change of attitude also extended to some of his recent political feuds. Just days after attacking Democratic Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, mocking her name and calling her incompetent on Twitter, the president said he had a âreally great conversationâ with her and detailed the support the federal government was providing her state. On Friday, he had suggested that if state leaders were not âappreciativeâ of him, he wouldnât talk to them. On Tuesday, he recounted conversations with Democratic governors in California and Louisiana. The new call from the White House was to continue the current mitigation efforts for an additional 30 days; that even if things go from bad to worse in the weeks to come, the efforts will pay off. It will, however, be a long, slow grind. CNN reporter Jim Acosta asks if Mr Trump had ""lulled the nation into a false sense of security"" by downplaying the dangers in the early days of the virus. ""It's going to go away,"" Mr Trump responds, adding ""hopefully by the end of the month"". He says he was always aware of the severity of the virus, ever since its early days in China. In fact, at the time, Mr Trump compared the illness to the seasonal flu, despite health workers saying coronavirus was far more deadly and contagious. Mr Trump now says he did not want to panic people because ""I want to give people a feeling of hope."" ""I want to be positive. I don't want to be negative,"" he says, calling the virus, ""the worst thing probably that this country has ever seen"". So far, much of the press briefing has focused on the projected number of deaths, and the importance of mitigation measures like social distancing. But some politics has crept in too. Mr Trump has praised himself for his response to both the impeachment trial, and the outbreak. Mr Trump says that his impeachment, which was finalised in early February, was a ""distraction"" from coronavirus. But he adds that it did not ""divert my attention"" from the pandemic, and that his response would not have changed. ""I think I'm getting A pluses for how I conducted myself,"" during the impeachment trial he says. ""I don't think I would have done any better had I not been impeached... Maybe that's a tribute to something. Maybe it's a tribute to me. But I don't think I would have acted any different."" White House experts are asked to comment on whether more lives could have been saved if mitigation efforts, like social distancing, had begun earlier. But Dr Fauci and Dr Birx both say that question is essentially impossible to answer - because it is impossible to know whether the virus was already present in the US earlier in the year, that could have been prevented from spreading. ""If there were covert infections here that we didn't know about and we didn't mitigate, it would have made a difference,"" Dr Fauci says. ""But I believe that we acted very very early there."" Mr Trump says hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malaria medication that he has touted as a possible cure to Covid-19, ""would be a game-changer"". Dr Fauci stressed that it was one of many drugs being tested, but those drugs are ""generally drugs that already exist for other things"". ""There's a whole menu of drugs and interventions that are now going into clinical trials, that are not approved for anything yet,"" Dr Fauci says. Mr Trump says the first question he asks of officials everyday is the progress on testing for a vaccine. Mr Trump says the projected numbers of coronavirus deaths are ""sobering"", especially as 100,000 is a ""minimum number"". ""One hundred thousand, according to the modelling, is a very low number,"" he says. Mr Trump has criticised those who want to ""ride it out"". He says ""a lot of people were asking"" whether Covid-19 was comparable to the flu, ""and I was asking that also"". ""But its not the flu. It's vicious."" Mr Trump has been criticised for downplaying the pandemic for weeks, and saying that it may pass by like the seasonal flu. On 24 March, he told Fox News that ""we've never closed down the country for the flu."" One ongoing area of debate in the US has been whether the general public should wear masks when they leave home. Current advice from the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) is that members of the public do not need to wear masks unless they are ill, or caring for someone ill. However, earlier today, Dr Fauci told CNN that once there are enough masks in supply for healthcare workers, it might be time for the US public to begin wearing masks outside their home as well. He said the issue would be discussed at today's White House coronavirus taskforce meeting. Mr Trump was just asked about the subject at the press briefing, and said: ""You can use a scarf, scarfs would be very good."" ""It's not a bad idea. At least for a period of time,"" he continues, adding: ""And eventually it'll be gone. Hopefully gone for a long time.""    Dr Fauci says that the lower end of the projected number of deaths in the US, 100,000, is already based on mitigation measures being put in place - but that he still hopes ""we can influence this to varying degrees. We want to do much much better than that."" Meanwhile, Mr Trump has been stressing the importance of mitigation measures. The question, he says, is ""what would have happened if we did nothing"", and just decided to ""ride it out?"" ""I think from a practical standard that couldn't have been carried out"", he says, because models forecast that if the US did not undertake any mitigation efforts at all, ""that number [of deaths] becomes 1.5m up to 2.2m, and even beyond."" Dr Birx, the White House coronavirus co-ordinator, says projections show between 100,000 and 200,000 Americans could die due to Covid-19. ""We think that that is the range,â she said, adding that projections are based on some citizens still not doing everything they can to control the spread of the virus. ""We really believe, and we hope everyday, we can do better than that."" Dr Fauci also reiterated that the task force would ""do everything we can to get it even significantly below that"". Dr Fauci continues: ""As sobering a number as that [100,000] is, we should be prepared for it. Is it going to be that much? I hope not and the more we push on mitigation the less likely it would be that number. ""But being realistic, we need to prepare ourselves... It will be difficult â no one is denying we are going through a very difficult time right now."" Deaths from coronavirus are expected to continue into June, according to White House projections. Dr Fauci points out that ""deaths always lag"", even when the number of new cases begins to slow. Dr Anthony Fauci, the US infectious diseases chief, says in the next several days or week, the nation will see cases rise - but the data shows ""mitigation is actually working and will work"". ""Our goal, which I believe we can accomplish, is to get the hot spot places - New York, New Jersey - and help them to get around that [peak] curve but as importantly, to prevent those clusters of areas that have not yet gone to that spike to prevent them from getting that spike. ""The 15 days of mitigation that we had clearly have had an effect, though it's tough to quantitate it."" Dr Fauci ends by saying the containment measures over the next 30 days should be done with ""all the intensity and force that we can"". We can bring you an update on the news of the13-year-old boy who died in London after testing positive for coronavirus(see our post from 20:51). The boy, named Ismail Mohamed Abdulwahab, died in King's College Hospital, south-east London, early on Monday. He is thought to be the youngest person to have died with the virus in the UK. Ismail's family said they were ""beyond devastated"" by his death, according to a statement released by a family friend. They said he had no apparent underlying health conditions and tested positive for Covid-19 on Friday, a day after he was admitted to King's College Hospital. Mark Stephenson, college director at the Madinah College where Ismail's sister works, has set up a fundraiser to pay for the funeral costs. A statement on the page said Ismail died ""without any family members close by due to the highly infectious nature of Covid-19"". The boy tested positive for Covid-19 at King's College Hospital ""No one has been turned away, no one who has needed ventilation has not received ventilation,"" says Dr Birx of the outbreak in the US, adding that it's been extremely stressful for health systems and those dealing with this crisis firsthand. ""I know its stressful to follow the guidelines but it is more stressful and more difficult to the soldiers on the front line,"" she says. ""There's no magic bullet. No magic vaccine or therapy. It's just behaviours - each of our behaviours translating into something that changes the course of this viral pandemic over the next 30 days."" Dr Deborah Birx, one of the experts on the US taskforce, says one prediction model shows that if everyone follows the distancing guidelines, it takes the US down to 100,000 or 200,000 deaths - ""which is still way too much"". Dr Birx says seeing the case rates in Washington and California, which are far lower than New York, is promising - and is why the US must adhere to strict rules to combat the virus. ""I know it's a lot to ask,"" she says. ""Every one of us has a role to play in winning this war,"" Trump says. ""Every citizen, family, and business can make the difference in stopping the virus. This is our shared patriotic duty. ""Challenging times are ahead for the next 30 days and this is a very vital 30 days,"" he says. He adds that ""only good things can be said when you look at the job thatâs been done"". Trump says the US government is sending planeloads of supplies to help communities and offers prayers for those helping others and fighting for their lives. ""The country has come together like I've never seen it before,"" he adds. ""We will prevail, we will win and hopefully it'll be in a relatively short period of time."" Trump begins by detailing the equipment the federal government will be sending out to states. This includes hundreds of ventilators as well as field hospitals that will be set up by the Army Corps of Engineers. Trump also says since 29 January, over 25,000 Americans have been repatriated from more than 50 countries where they were, ""in some cases, locked in"". ""I want every American to be prepared for the hard days that lie ahead,"" the president adds. ""We're going to go through a very tough two weeks and then hopefully, as the experts are predicting...we're going to start seeing some real light at the end of the tunnel. But this is going to be a very painful, very very painful two weeks."" US President Donald Trump is speaking now at the White House as the daily coronavirus task force briefing begins. The nation now has over 181,000 confirmed Covid-19 cases and has seen 3,606 deaths so far. An asylum seeker living in a migrant camp in Greece has tested positive for coronavirus, becoming the first known refugee in the country to do so. The woman was diagnosed with Covid-19 after giving birth at a hospital in the Greek capital, Athens. Greek authorities are tracing her recent contacts but believe she may have contracted the virus in hospital. The woman's baby has been tested, with results pending. She had been living among around 2,500 people at a migrant camp on the Greek mainland. There have been no cases of coronavirus at the camp, where an isolation area is available, a Greek migration ministry official told Reuters news agency. Greece has reported 1,314 cases and 49 deaths from coronavirus so far. Human rights groups and medical charities have raised concerns about the risk of the coronavirus spreading rapidly in overcrowded and often squalid migrant camps in Greece. Medical charity Medicins Sans Frontieres (MSF) has called on the Greek government to evacuate all its migrant camps immediately. In Moria in Lesbos, 18,000 people are staying in a facility built for 3,000. Young filmmakers have sent the BBC footage of conditions at the camp, which can be seen in the video below. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Protecting yourself in a migrant camp A number of big banks in Britain have agreed to ditch payouts to shareholders in the face of the coronavirus outbreak. The banks - including NatWest, Santander, Nationwide, the Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds, Barclays, HSBC and Standard Chartered - will suspend dividends and share buybacks until the end of the year and cancel outstanding dividends from 2019. The Bank of England's Prudential Regulation Authority said it also expected banks not to pay any cash bonuses to senior staff. The PRA said this was a ""sensible precautionary step given the unique role that banks need to play in supporting the wider economy through a period of economic disruption. ""We do not expect the capital preserved to be needed by the banks in order to maintain adequate capital positions, but the extra headroom should help the banks support the economy through 2020.""

President Donald Trump and his team are expected to offer details on the data that led to the extension of containment efforts until, at least, the end of April. Yesterday, the president told reporters he had been informed that up to two million Americans could die in a worst-case scenario. We'll soon get a closer look at those models. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Have you been thinking about getting a mortgage? You're going to need to think again as lenders are scrapping their home loan deals. On Tuesday, Nationwide - one of the UK's biggest lenders - effectively pulled out of new deals. Others are doing the same as the home mortgage market goes into lockdown amid the coronavirus which has brought the economy to a virtual standstill. Nationwide will now only offer home loans to those with 25% equity or more. It rules out first-time borrowers or existing homeowners with little equity in their home. Banks to allow customers to defer mortgage payments Coronavirus: How the interest rate cuts affect you Nationwide said the change will not impact existing applications. In fact it will allow it to ""focus on supporting existing mortgage members, while continuing to process ongoing applications"", it said. The mutual's existing mortgage customers will still be offered mortgage deals of up to 95% loan to value (LTV), it added. Nationwide blamed ""an extremely high number of enquiries about existing mortgages and ongoing applications"". ""That is why we have taken this decision on a temporary basis although, by continuing to offer home loans up to 75% LTV, we can continue supporting the housing market,"" it said. Other lenders that have taken similar action include Santander and Skipton Building Society but many have gone further, by reducing the loan-to-value ratio to 60%. That means borrowers will need a 40% deposit or equity in their home to be able to get a mortgage. Lenders that have done this include Barclays, Halifax, Virgin Money and The Family Building Society, while the Coventry Building Society has cut its LTV ratio to 65%. ""The recent withdrawal of many higher LTV mortgage products and home purchase products is hopefully a temporary measure while lenders reassess risk in this area of the market and work out what it will be possible for them to offer while the current restrictions are in place,"" said Eleanor Williams, finance Expert at Moneyfacts.co.uk. ""With so much uncertainty at the moment, providers seem to initially be focusing on the support that their existing customers may need in the coming weeks."" Nationwide has increase the deposit it requires for a new mortgage Chris Sykes, mortgage consultant at broker Private Finance, reckons there are good reasons for the changes. ""Lenders are having to work at a lower capacity because of staff being off and having to deal with thousands of calls for mortgage payment holidays,"" he said. ""So they don't really have the capacity to do a lot of new mortgages right now. If they are going to do any, they want high-quality low-risk mortgages."" It is also worth bearing in mind that valuers cannot get out to see properties right now which will affect more complex property purchases, he added. ""Lower loan-to-value loans means there's more likeliness of an online or automated valuation,"" he said. That won't be affected. Lenders say they will carry on with home loans already agreed. Nationwide said: ""Existing applications, where a product has already been reserved, will continue to progress."" For people who've already made offers but who may have been affected by Covid-19, lenders are offering extra protection for people. They will give customers who have exchanged contracts the option to extend their mortgage offer for up to three months to allow them to move at a later date. ""Lenders and borrowers face an unprecedented set of circumstances,"" said Robin Fieth, chief executive of the Building Societies Association. He pointed out that people who would have been preparing and expecting to move house in the coming weeks now face a wait until Covid-19 restrictions can be lifted. He said: ""Our hearts go out to them and our heads are clear that it would be unfair for these people to have to start their mortgage application all over again once life returns to a more normal state. ""A three-month extension of existing mortgage offers seems a fair and reasonable step to take."" âMy dream home hangs in the balanceâ Mortgage holidays offered amid coronavirus outbreak Budget: 'First-time buyers need more help' Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Locals find homes reduced to ash as fears grow of more fierce winds spreading LA fires Climate 'whiplash' linked to raging LA fires Watch: The moment five US presidents gather at Jimmy Carter's funeral The '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty.

"This video can not be played WATCH: Why Oxford University experts are urging the rollout of a coronavirus app A coronavirus app that alerts people if they have recently been in contact with someone testing positive for the virus ""could play a critical role"" in limiting lockdowns, scientists advising the government have said. The location-tracking tech would enable a week's worth of manual detective work to be done in an instant, they say. But the academics say no-one should be forced to enrol - at least initially. UK health chiefs have confirmed they are exploring the idea. ""NHSX is looking at whether app-based solutions might be helpful in tracking and managing coronavirus, and we have assembled expertise from inside and outside the organisation to do this as rapidly as possible,"" said the tech-focused division's chief Matthew Gould. The study by the team at the University of Oxford's Big Data Institute and Nuffield Department of Medicinewas published in the journal Science,external. It proposes that an app would record people's GPS location data as they move about their daily lives. This would be supplemented by users scanning QR (quick response) codes posted to public amenities in places where a GPS signal is inadequate, as well as Bluetooth signals. If a person starts feeling ill, it is suggested they use the app to request a home test. And if it comes back positive for Covid-19, then an instant signal would be sent to everyone they had been in close contact with over recent days. Those people would be advised to self-isolate for a fortnight, but would not be told who had triggered the warning. In addition, the test subject's workplace and their transport providers could be told to carry out a decontamination clean-up. ""The constrictions that we're currently under place [many people] under severe strain,"" said the paper's co-lead Prof Christophe Fraser. ""Therefore if you have the ability with a bit more information and the use of an app to relax a lockdown, that could provide very substantial and direct benefits. ""Also I think a substantial number of lives can be saved."" To encourage take-up, it is suggested the app also acts as a hub for coronavirus-related health services and serves as a means to request food and medicine deliveries. The academics note that similar smartphone software has already been deployed in China. It was also voluntary there, but users were allowed to go into public spaces or on public transport only if they had installed it. EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? IN-DEPTH:Coronavirus pandemic One of the ethics specialists involved in the Oxford study said he did not think similar arrangements would be appropriate in the UK, but added that private enterprises might still impose restrictions. ""My favourite restaurant might ask me to show that I was low-risk before allowing me into a crowded place, and I think that would be a perfectly reasonable price to pay for this step towards returning to normal life,"" Prof Michael Parker told the BBC. He added that employers might also be justified in requiring staff to use the app if they worked ""in an old people's home, with vulnerable groups or [were based] in very crowded places"". And while he said that the general public should not be compelled to use the app to begin with, he did not rule this out if the majority failed to do so. ""The key question is - does it require everyone to do it for it to be effective?"" Prof Parker explained. ""It's not essential that everyone does... but perhaps a high proportion of the population needs to. ""This is a really unusual situation where lives are at risk, so there is a case to be made to make at least some actions compulsory - but there would need to be a really clear case for that and careful oversight."" The paper adds that the app could be updated to tackle the pandemic more aggressively if required. For example, it says, the stay-at-home alerts could be expanded to second or even third-degree contacts. And while the paper advocates the app being used in conjunction with home tests, Prof Fraser said his team was currently exploring whether it would still be effective if it relied on people using a questionnaire or 111 helpline advisers to diagnose the condition. NHS turns to big tech to tackle Covid-19 UK coronavirus app 'must respect privacy rights' NHS uses tech giants to plan crisis response He acknowledged some people might be wary of using the service, but hoped they would do so to ""save a lot of lives"". ""We already have tracking apps on our phones for more trivial tasks - the reason we have live traffic information is because we allow the people that provide the mapping service to track us,"" he said. ""What we're suggesting here is essentially sharing anonymised information [to] put to good use."" We know that the UK is preparing to roll out its own contact-tracing app and this paper by scientists who are close to the government reinforces what a vital role it could play. But it also shows why it may be a while before any app is rolled out. A key part of making the process by which people are informed that they have been in contact with someone infected with Covid-19 is the availability of testing. With only 11,000 tests a day available right now, most people who installed an app might find it of little use if they developed mild symptoms of the virus. Without a confirmed diagnosis, nothing would happen. The other concern is privacy. With the government wary of being seen as Big Brother, the app would need to convince users it wouldn't allow them to be spied on for ever more. Singapore's TraceTogether, which has been praised by privacy experts for collecting a bare minimum of data, could provide a template for the NHS app. Rather than constantly tracking people, it uses Bluetooth to record your proximity to other app users so that they can be alerted if you later test positive for the virus. But while the government will almost certainly make use of the app optional, the concern is that it could become essential for anyone wanting to return to normal life. What, for instance, is to stop pubs and restaurants demanding to see evidence of your Covid status before allowing you in? When the app does emerge, there will be a major marketing exercise behind it to convince as many people as possible to install it.  It will only be effective if a good proportion of the population are persuaded that it will help the UK beat the virus - and let them leave home and get back to work.

"North Yorkshire Police officers have stopped motorists in cars to check that their travel is ""essential"" UK police officers have been told to take a ""consistent"" approach when ensuring people comply with emergency measures aimed at curbing coronavirus. Guidance to officers calls on forces to ""coordinate"" efforts and emphasises the importance of professionalism. It comes amid criticism of the way some forces have handled the new measures. A former Justice of the Supreme Court told the BBCone force's use of drones to film walkers in the Peak District had been ""disgraceful"". But Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said police forces were doing a difficult job and being sensible about enforcing social distancing measures. As of 17:00 BST on Monday, the total number of people who have died with coronavirus in the UK rose by 381 to 1,789 - the biggest daily increase so far. NHS England said 28 people, aged from 19 to 91, who died in England did not have underlying health conditions. BBC News online health editor Michelle Roberts said the latest increase was ""not unexpected and does not suggest things are spiralling out of control"". ""Had deaths continued to grow at the recent daily rate of roughly a third a day, we might have expected to see 350 new deaths on Sunday and 450 on Monday,"" she said. New guidance was issued to police on Thursday when officers were given powers to fine people who gather in groups or refuse to return home, followingsocial distancing measures,externalintroduced by the government last week. The document from the National Police Chiefs' Council and the College of Policing, seen by the BBC, says: communities must receive a ""consistent"" level of service from officers as well as a ""single style and tone"" police should keep an ""inquisitive, questioning mindset"" when finding out why people are outside new enforcement measures should not be used if people are vulnerable and cannot safely return home However, some forces have adopted different approaches, particularly around the issue of driving. Derbyshire Police used drones to film people parking their cars for walks in the Peak District. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Lancashire Police issued 123 enforcement notices over the weekend, while Cheshire Police summonsed six people for various offences, including travelling to purchase ""non-essential"" items. On Monday, Lord Sumption, a former Justice of the Supreme Court, said the actions of Derbyshire Police ""shamed our policing traditions"". Derbyshire's chief constable, Peter Goodman, told BBC Radio 5 Live's Emma Barnett the decision to deploy a drone in the Peak District came after supermarkets in villages were emptied and beauty spots were inundated with sightseers. ""Some forces will be doing not enough, perhaps, some forces have probably gone a bit too far and some sit in the middle. Some would say we in Derbyshire have gone too far,"" he said. ""I genuinely believe that we haven't because we are trying to do everything through conversation and explanation."" There have been discussions among senior officers about the need for police to exercise common sense and sound judgment. Forces were ""finding their way"" in dealing with the unprecedented measures, Martin Hewitt from the National Police Chiefs' Council told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. The chief constable of Avon and Somerset Police, Andy Marsh, said officers want to work with the public in promoting social distancing. ""We're not going to enforce our way out of this problem,"" he said. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash Meanwhile, Downing Street has suggested that the target of testing 25,000 people per day for coronavirus may not be met until the end of April. The prime minister's spokesman added that NHS trusts had been told to use any spare capacity for testing of NHS staff. As of 09:00 BST on Tuesday, the number of people tested in the UK for coronavirus reached 143,186. An average of about 7,500 new people were tested per day in the seven days up to Tuesday, compared to a daily average of about 5,700 in the previous seven days. It comes as scientists advising the government said a coronavirus app that alerts people if they have recently been in contact with someone testing positive for the virus""could play a critical role"" in limiting lockdowns. This video can not be played Dominic Raab said charter flights will be arranged for countries where commercial flights have stopped. On Monday, the UK's chief scientific adviser said there wereearly signs the social distancing measures - which restrict people's travel and activities outside their home - were ""making a difference"". Sir Patrick Vallance said at the government's daily coronavirus news briefing that the NHS was seeing around an additional 1,000 patients a day and described this daily rise as stable ""which may suggest that we're already beginning to see some effect"". Meanwhile, the Office for National Statistics (ONS)released new figures on coronavirus deaths in England and Waleswhich showed for the first time the number of deaths linked to Covid-19 outside of hospitals. The new ONS data includes how many deaths were registered up to the 20 March - the day that pubs and clubs were ordered to shut down to help tackle the outbreak. What's different about the data is it looks at community deaths - people who died at home or in residential care who doctors recorded on the death certificate as probably having Covid-19. There were 103 - 1% of all deaths. The ONS also trawled a few days ahead of the 20 March to capture any deaths stuck in a recording backlog - bringing the total to 210 deaths involving coronavirus. That's 40 more than the 170 deaths that the government announced at the time - those were all hospital deaths of patients who had tested positive for coronavirus and so definitely had the infection. In comparison, there are not enough tests to check how many people in the community are infected, or how many deaths are linked to Covid-19, the disease caused by coronavirus. So these community death figures are interesting, but they don't give us a clearer idea of the true toll.

"People queueing outside a supermarket Aldi, Morrisons, Waitrose and Asda are easing restrictions on some of their products which were imposed in the wake of stockpiling earlier this month. All the major supermarkets restricted customers to buying fixed numbers of individual items to keep shelves full. Aldi is now scrapping limits completely on all but a few items, while Morrisons, Waitrose and Asda  have also removed some limits and changed others. Meanwhile, grocery sales in the UK were at record levels in March. Aldi customers will be able to buy as many as they want of most items in its stores. However, they will only be allowed to purchase four of some - including hand wash and soap, toilet roll, certain canned goods and alcohol - and  two of antibacterial hand gel, UHT milk and baby formula. Morrisons is upping the limits on some items from three to four per customer and removing some altogether to make it easier for people to donate to food banks. The supermarket will create local drop-off points for customers to donate products to others and will distribute Â£10m of food to food banks itself. How are supermarkets keeping customers safe? Supermarkets 'drastically' cutting product ranges Waitrose is removing its cap on all fresh food, so meat, fish, poultry and other fresh goods can now be purchased freely along with fruit and vegetables. Alcohol and Easter confectionery are also not subject to limits, although restrictions do remain on certain items. Asda is removing limits on fruit and vegetables and chilled products. Tesco, Sainsbury's and Co-op are not changing their policies on restrictions at the moment. Meanwhile, figures from consumer analysts Kantar showed huge increases in shopping in the UK this month. The busiest spell was from 16-19 March, when 88% of households visited a food store, adding up to 42 million extra trips across four days. In the last four weeks, year-on-year supermarket sales grew by 20.6%. Kantar's Fraser McKevitt said Â£10.8bn sales in the past four weeks were ""even higher than levels seen at Christmas"". The figures have mainly risen because of people making extra shopping trips, rather than spending more on each visit. The average household spent an extra Â£62.92 during the past four weeks, equivalent to adding five days' worth of groceries. London had the biggest increase, with grocery spending up by 26% during the month. EASY STEPS:What can I do? CONTAINMENT:What it means to self-isolate UK LATEST:What's the UK's plan and what could happen next? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash Mr McKevitt added: ""It's inevitable that shoppers will add extra items to their baskets when faced with restrictions on their movement. ""With restaurants and cafes now closed, none of us can eat meals on the go any longer and an extra 503 million meals, mainly lunches and snacks, will be prepared and eaten at home every week for the foreseeable future."" Online grocery spending was 13% higher than in the same period last year. The average online basket cost Â£81.88, which was Â£6 more than in March 2019, while 14.6% of households received an online delivery - up from 13.8% at the same time last year. Sales of alcohol rose by 22% - an extra Â£199m. There was also a rise in spending for families with children over the age of 16, which is likely to be down to the youngsters returning early from college or university. Those families spent Â£508 on average on groceries in March, Â£88.13 more than they did in the same month last year. Supermarket spending data from analysts Nielsen showed that in the week ending 21 March, many shoppers had filled their cupboards and instead were deciding to stock up the freezer. Its figures showed that sales of frozen food that week rose by 84% compared with the same period last year. Nielsen's Mike Watkins said there had been a ""seismic shift in overall shopping patterns"". He added: ""Unlike stores, there is a finite capacity for online grocery shopping, due to warehouse capacity and available delivery slots, and this will have limited the growth of online sales."" Online deliveries have been a sticking point for many people, who have found themselves unable to book slots and followPrime Minister Boris Johnson's request to use online deliveriesand stay at home. Tesco, which last weeklimited online orders to 80 items only,has now expanded its home delivery and click and collect services to about 780,000 slots this week - up from 660,000 two weeks ago. It has plans to add another 100,000 slots in the coming weeks. It has also recruited more than 7,500 staff and added more than 200 new vans to its fleet. Asda is also recruiting more delivery drivers, while Sainsbury's has introduced priority slots for elderly and vulnerable customers and is contacting eligible customers on its database. Morrisons is creating 3,500 new jobs to help expand its online delivery service, while Waitrose says it will set aside at least a quarter of its delivery slots to elderly or vulnerable people and is working to identify eligible customers.

"Kelly Fitzgibbons with Ava and Lexi Needham Four members of a family found dead at a house in West Sussex have been named by police. The bodies of Kelly Fitzgibbons, 40, and Robert Needham, 42, were found alongside their children Ava Needham, four, and two-year-old Lexi Needham. A murder investigation began after police were called to Duffield Lane in Woodmancote near Chichester on Sunday. Detectives are ""not seeking anyone else in connection with the matter"" and described it as an ""isolated incident"". A post-mortem examination has not yet taken place and police have not commented on the nature of their deaths. The body of a pet dog was also found at the house, police said. Robert Needham was found dead at the property in Woodmancote Local resident and district councillor Roy Briscoe said he lived in the same lane. ""They were a young couple, with two young children. We can't believe what happened,"" he told BBC Radio Sussex. ""It really is saddening. The whole lane is in shock really."" Ch Supt Westerman said it was a ""a very, very difficult situation to have to deal with, particularly when children are involved"". Police family liaison officers had been deployed to support the family, while detectives carry out house-to-house enquiries, speak to witnesses and carry out forensic investigations, he said. ""Importantly, we will be speaking to the family to understand what has gone on and get to the bottom of what has happened,"" he added.

"This video can not be played WATCH: Why Oxford University experts are urging the rollout of a coronavirus app A coronavirus app that alerts people if they have recently been in contact with someone testing positive for the virus ""could play a critical role"" in limiting lockdowns, scientists advising the government have said. The location-tracking tech would enable a week's worth of manual detective work to be done in an instant, they say. But the academics say no-one should be forced to enrol - at least initially. UK health chiefs have confirmed they are exploring the idea. ""NHSX is looking at whether app-based solutions might be helpful in tracking and managing coronavirus, and we have assembled expertise from inside and outside the organisation to do this as rapidly as possible,"" said the tech-focused division's chief Matthew Gould. The study by the team at the University of Oxford's Big Data Institute and Nuffield Department of Medicinewas published in the journal Science,external. It proposes that an app would record people's GPS location data as they move about their daily lives. This would be supplemented by users scanning QR (quick response) codes posted to public amenities in places where a GPS signal is inadequate, as well as Bluetooth signals. If a person starts feeling ill, it is suggested they use the app to request a home test. And if it comes back positive for Covid-19, then an instant signal would be sent to everyone they had been in close contact with over recent days. Those people would be advised to self-isolate for a fortnight, but would not be told who had triggered the warning. In addition, the test subject's workplace and their transport providers could be told to carry out a decontamination clean-up. ""The constrictions that we're currently under place [many people] under severe strain,"" said the paper's co-lead Prof Christophe Fraser. ""Therefore if you have the ability with a bit more information and the use of an app to relax a lockdown, that could provide very substantial and direct benefits. ""Also I think a substantial number of lives can be saved."" To encourage take-up, it is suggested the app also acts as a hub for coronavirus-related health services and serves as a means to request food and medicine deliveries. The academics note that similar smartphone software has already been deployed in China. It was also voluntary there, but users were allowed to go into public spaces or on public transport only if they had installed it. EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? IN-DEPTH:Coronavirus pandemic One of the ethics specialists involved in the Oxford study said he did not think similar arrangements would be appropriate in the UK, but added that private enterprises might still impose restrictions. ""My favourite restaurant might ask me to show that I was low-risk before allowing me into a crowded place, and I think that would be a perfectly reasonable price to pay for this step towards returning to normal life,"" Prof Michael Parker told the BBC. He added that employers might also be justified in requiring staff to use the app if they worked ""in an old people's home, with vulnerable groups or [were based] in very crowded places"". And while he said that the general public should not be compelled to use the app to begin with, he did not rule this out if the majority failed to do so. ""The key question is - does it require everyone to do it for it to be effective?"" Prof Parker explained. ""It's not essential that everyone does... but perhaps a high proportion of the population needs to. ""This is a really unusual situation where lives are at risk, so there is a case to be made to make at least some actions compulsory - but there would need to be a really clear case for that and careful oversight."" The paper adds that the app could be updated to tackle the pandemic more aggressively if required. For example, it says, the stay-at-home alerts could be expanded to second or even third-degree contacts. And while the paper advocates the app being used in conjunction with home tests, Prof Fraser said his team was currently exploring whether it would still be effective if it relied on people using a questionnaire or 111 helpline advisers to diagnose the condition. NHS turns to big tech to tackle Covid-19 UK coronavirus app 'must respect privacy rights' NHS uses tech giants to plan crisis response He acknowledged some people might be wary of using the service, but hoped they would do so to ""save a lot of lives"". ""We already have tracking apps on our phones for more trivial tasks - the reason we have live traffic information is because we allow the people that provide the mapping service to track us,"" he said. ""What we're suggesting here is essentially sharing anonymised information [to] put to good use."" We know that the UK is preparing to roll out its own contact-tracing app and this paper by scientists who are close to the government reinforces what a vital role it could play. But it also shows why it may be a while before any app is rolled out. A key part of making the process by which people are informed that they have been in contact with someone infected with Covid-19 is the availability of testing. With only 11,000 tests a day available right now, most people who installed an app might find it of little use if they developed mild symptoms of the virus. Without a confirmed diagnosis, nothing would happen. The other concern is privacy. With the government wary of being seen as Big Brother, the app would need to convince users it wouldn't allow them to be spied on for ever more. Singapore's TraceTogether, which has been praised by privacy experts for collecting a bare minimum of data, could provide a template for the NHS app. Rather than constantly tracking people, it uses Bluetooth to record your proximity to other app users so that they can be alerted if you later test positive for the virus. But while the government will almost certainly make use of the app optional, the concern is that it could become essential for anyone wanting to return to normal life. What, for instance, is to stop pubs and restaurants demanding to see evidence of your Covid status before allowing you in? When the app does emerge, there will be a major marketing exercise behind it to convince as many people as possible to install it.  It will only be effective if a good proportion of the population are persuaded that it will help the UK beat the virus - and let them leave home and get back to work.

"A series of strict measures to fight the coronavirus outbreak has been introduced by the government. They are aimed at stopping the spread of infection by making people stay at home unless absolutely necessary. Under the new regulations,externalnobody may leave their homes ""without reasonable excuse"". Reasonable excuses include: Shopping for basic necessities such as food or medicine To take exercise (the guidelines suggest once a day, and in Wales that is the law) Seeking medical assistance, or to avoid injury or illness or to escape a risk of harm Providing care or assistance to a vulnerable person, providing emergency assistance, or donating blood Travelling to work or to carry out voluntary services, where it's not possible to do these from home Attending the funeral of a member of your household, or a close family member (or in some circumstances, a friend) Fulfilling legal obligations, such as attending court, satisfying bail requirements or participating in legal proceedings Accessing critical public services including childcare or education, social services, or victim support Allowing children of separated parents to move between both households Moving house where reasonably necessary Religious ministers are also allowed to visit their place of worship. When outside your home, you should keep a safe distance of 2m or more from anyone who is not a member of your household. Many businesses and venues have been ordered to close. These include: Pubs, cafes and restaurants - although food delivery and takeaway are still permitted Cinemas and theatres, libraries, community centres, youth centres, and places of worship All shops selling ""non-essential"" goods - this includes clothing and electronics stores, and hair, beauty and nail salons Indoor and outdoor leisure facilities such as bowling alleys, arcades and soft play facilities Communal places within parks, such as playgrounds, sports courts and outdoor gyms Hotels, hostels, bed-and-breakfasts, campsites and caravan parks (excluding those providing accommodation for key workers, permanent residents and the homeless) Shops that remain open include supermarkets, pharmacies, petrol stations and post offices. A full list can be foundhere,external. Tradespeople can still carry out repair and maintenance work in people's homes as long as they are well and have no symptoms, and keep 2m away from people in the household. However, in households where people are self-isolating, or where a vulnerable individual is beingshielded, no work should be carried out except emergency repairs to remedy a direct safety risk to the household. All gatherings of more than two people have been banned by the government. The only exceptions are: Where the gathering is of a group of people who live together - for example, a parent can take their children to the shops if they can't be left at home alone Where the gathering is essential for work purposes - although workers should try to keep all meetings to a minimum In addition, the government has stopped weddings, baptisms and other religious ceremonies, apart from funerals. The restrictions were announced on 23 March by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, with the plan to review them after three weeks. The police have been given powers to make sure people follow the measures. If you leave your home or gather in public for any reason other than those allowed, the police may instruct you to go home or disperse. They may also instruct you to stop your children from also breaking the rules. They also have the power to take you home or arrest you. What powers do the police have? If the police believe you have broken rules, or if you refuse to follow their instructions, they may issue you with a fine of Â£60 (reduced to Â£30 if paid within 14 days). If it's the second time you've received a fine, the amount will increase to Â£120 and double on each further repeat offence. The guidance says that ""the police will act with discretion and common sense in applying these measures"". Local authorities (such as trading standards officers) will be monitoring local businesses to make sure they also follow the rules. Those that don't comply will face the threat of fines, and of being closed down. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? NEW GUIDANCE:What must I do? NEW RESTRICTIONS:What are they?

"Have you been thinking about getting a mortgage? You're going to need to think again as lenders are scrapping their home loan deals. On Tuesday, Nationwide - one of the UK's biggest lenders - effectively pulled out of new deals. Others are doing the same as the home mortgage market goes into lockdown amid the coronavirus which has brought the economy to a virtual standstill. Nationwide will now only offer home loans to those with 25% equity or more. It rules out first-time borrowers or existing homeowners with little equity in their home. Banks to allow customers to defer mortgage payments Coronavirus: How the interest rate cuts affect you Nationwide said the change will not impact existing applications. In fact it will allow it to ""focus on supporting existing mortgage members, while continuing to process ongoing applications"", it said. The mutual's existing mortgage customers will still be offered mortgage deals of up to 95% loan to value (LTV), it added. Nationwide blamed ""an extremely high number of enquiries about existing mortgages and ongoing applications"". ""That is why we have taken this decision on a temporary basis although, by continuing to offer home loans up to 75% LTV, we can continue supporting the housing market,"" it said. Other lenders that have taken similar action include Santander and Skipton Building Society but many have gone further, by reducing the loan-to-value ratio to 60%. That means borrowers will need a 40% deposit or equity in their home to be able to get a mortgage. Lenders that have done this include Barclays, Halifax, Virgin Money and The Family Building Society, while the Coventry Building Society has cut its LTV ratio to 65%. ""The recent withdrawal of many higher LTV mortgage products and home purchase products is hopefully a temporary measure while lenders reassess risk in this area of the market and work out what it will be possible for them to offer while the current restrictions are in place,"" said Eleanor Williams, finance Expert at Moneyfacts.co.uk. ""With so much uncertainty at the moment, providers seem to initially be focusing on the support that their existing customers may need in the coming weeks."" Nationwide has increase the deposit it requires for a new mortgage Chris Sykes, mortgage consultant at broker Private Finance, reckons there are good reasons for the changes. ""Lenders are having to work at a lower capacity because of staff being off and having to deal with thousands of calls for mortgage payment holidays,"" he said. ""So they don't really have the capacity to do a lot of new mortgages right now. If they are going to do any, they want high-quality low-risk mortgages."" It is also worth bearing in mind that valuers cannot get out to see properties right now which will affect more complex property purchases, he added. ""Lower loan-to-value loans means there's more likeliness of an online or automated valuation,"" he said. That won't be affected. Lenders say they will carry on with home loans already agreed. Nationwide said: ""Existing applications, where a product has already been reserved, will continue to progress."" For people who've already made offers but who may have been affected by Covid-19, lenders are offering extra protection for people. They will give customers who have exchanged contracts the option to extend their mortgage offer for up to three months to allow them to move at a later date. ""Lenders and borrowers face an unprecedented set of circumstances,"" said Robin Fieth, chief executive of the Building Societies Association. He pointed out that people who would have been preparing and expecting to move house in the coming weeks now face a wait until Covid-19 restrictions can be lifted. He said: ""Our hearts go out to them and our heads are clear that it would be unfair for these people to have to start their mortgage application all over again once life returns to a more normal state. ""A three-month extension of existing mortgage offers seems a fair and reasonable step to take."" âMy dream home hangs in the balanceâ Mortgage holidays offered amid coronavirus outbreak Budget: 'First-time buyers need more help' Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Locals find homes reduced to ash as fears grow of more fierce winds spreading LA fires Climate 'whiplash' linked to raging LA fires Watch: The moment five US presidents gather at Jimmy Carter's funeral The '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty.

"People queueing outside a supermarket Aldi, Morrisons, Waitrose and Asda are easing restrictions on some of their products which were imposed in the wake of stockpiling earlier this month. All the major supermarkets restricted customers to buying fixed numbers of individual items to keep shelves full. Aldi is now scrapping limits completely on all but a few items, while Morrisons, Waitrose and Asda  have also removed some limits and changed others. Meanwhile, grocery sales in the UK were at record levels in March. Aldi customers will be able to buy as many as they want of most items in its stores. However, they will only be allowed to purchase four of some - including hand wash and soap, toilet roll, certain canned goods and alcohol - and  two of antibacterial hand gel, UHT milk and baby formula. Morrisons is upping the limits on some items from three to four per customer and removing some altogether to make it easier for people to donate to food banks. The supermarket will create local drop-off points for customers to donate products to others and will distribute Â£10m of food to food banks itself. How are supermarkets keeping customers safe? Supermarkets 'drastically' cutting product ranges Waitrose is removing its cap on all fresh food, so meat, fish, poultry and other fresh goods can now be purchased freely along with fruit and vegetables. Alcohol and Easter confectionery are also not subject to limits, although restrictions do remain on certain items. Asda is removing limits on fruit and vegetables and chilled products. Tesco, Sainsbury's and Co-op are not changing their policies on restrictions at the moment. Meanwhile, figures from consumer analysts Kantar showed huge increases in shopping in the UK this month. The busiest spell was from 16-19 March, when 88% of households visited a food store, adding up to 42 million extra trips across four days. In the last four weeks, year-on-year supermarket sales grew by 20.6%. Kantar's Fraser McKevitt said Â£10.8bn sales in the past four weeks were ""even higher than levels seen at Christmas"". The figures have mainly risen because of people making extra shopping trips, rather than spending more on each visit. The average household spent an extra Â£62.92 during the past four weeks, equivalent to adding five days' worth of groceries. London had the biggest increase, with grocery spending up by 26% during the month. EASY STEPS:What can I do? CONTAINMENT:What it means to self-isolate UK LATEST:What's the UK's plan and what could happen next? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash Mr McKevitt added: ""It's inevitable that shoppers will add extra items to their baskets when faced with restrictions on their movement. ""With restaurants and cafes now closed, none of us can eat meals on the go any longer and an extra 503 million meals, mainly lunches and snacks, will be prepared and eaten at home every week for the foreseeable future."" Online grocery spending was 13% higher than in the same period last year. The average online basket cost Â£81.88, which was Â£6 more than in March 2019, while 14.6% of households received an online delivery - up from 13.8% at the same time last year. Sales of alcohol rose by 22% - an extra Â£199m. There was also a rise in spending for families with children over the age of 16, which is likely to be down to the youngsters returning early from college or university. Those families spent Â£508 on average on groceries in March, Â£88.13 more than they did in the same month last year. Supermarket spending data from analysts Nielsen showed that in the week ending 21 March, many shoppers had filled their cupboards and instead were deciding to stock up the freezer. Its figures showed that sales of frozen food that week rose by 84% compared with the same period last year. Nielsen's Mike Watkins said there had been a ""seismic shift in overall shopping patterns"". He added: ""Unlike stores, there is a finite capacity for online grocery shopping, due to warehouse capacity and available delivery slots, and this will have limited the growth of online sales."" Online deliveries have been a sticking point for many people, who have found themselves unable to book slots and followPrime Minister Boris Johnson's request to use online deliveriesand stay at home. Tesco, which last weeklimited online orders to 80 items only,has now expanded its home delivery and click and collect services to about 780,000 slots this week - up from 660,000 two weeks ago. It has plans to add another 100,000 slots in the coming weeks. It has also recruited more than 7,500 staff and added more than 200 new vans to its fleet. Asda is also recruiting more delivery drivers, while Sainsbury's has introduced priority slots for elderly and vulnerable customers and is contacting eligible customers on its database. Morrisons is creating 3,500 new jobs to help expand its online delivery service, while Waitrose says it will set aside at least a quarter of its delivery slots to elderly or vulnerable people and is working to identify eligible customers.

"The four companies which manage ground operations at UK airports have warned that they are close to collapse, putting thousands of jobs at risk. Swissport, Worldwide Flight Services, Dnata and Menzies may not be able to continue operating for more than a few weeks, putting 25,000 jobs at risk. In a joint letter, they called for urgent assistance from the government. With most passenger flights suspended amid the coronavirus pandemic, their revenues have taken a hit. In the letter addressed to the chancellor, they said: ""We have all been able to weather previous crises, whether 9/11, Sars or the Icelandic volcanic eruption, but Covid-19 is different, as it is both global and longer-term."" The firms provide 90% of airport handling services across the country, and say that airports could have to close if they collapse. They warned that without their services, ""the airport infrastructure in the UK would grind to a halt for up to four months"". Between them, these four companies manage nearly all of the ground handling operations required by airlines at the UK's airports. They include refuelling, cleaning, baggage transfer, departure gate services and the loading and unloading of cargo. They do not work for the airports themselves, but are directly contracted by the airlines. They operate on a ""pay-as-you-go"" basis, charging for each service they provide. However, airlines are cutting their passenger operations right back due to travel restrictions around the world associated with the coronavirus pandemic. Cargo operations are continuing, and indeed some aircraft that would normally carry passengers have been operating as ""ghost flights"", simply to transport freight. But even that source of revenue is beginning to decline. As a result, the ground handlers say that they have lost 95% of their revenues over the past few weeks. According to Swissport's boss in Western Europe, Jason Holt, without immediate government support, the sector is ""perilously close to collapse"". If ground handlers were to go into administration, he claims, airports would simply be unable to operate. ""The aviation system is a triangle of airlines, airports and ground handling businesses"", he says. ""Without cargo and ground handling companies, international supply chains will stop functioning during the Covid-19 pandemic and recovery."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do i protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak His concerns are shared by the airports themselves, according to Henk van Klaveren, spokesman for the Airport Operators Association. ""It is a very serious issue, particularly for smaller airports where there is only one ground handling operator"", he says. ""These airports still need to operate, even with fewer flights. There's essential cargo, flights to isolated regions and so on."" The worry within the industry is that while the airlines themselves enjoy a high profile - and the political clout that goes with it - ground handling services operate far below the radar, but need help more urgently. As one executive put it, ""no one will see us quietly expire."" The four companies have welcomed Chancellor Rishi Sunak's job retention scheme, under which a government grant will help to cover the wages of employees who have to be put on furlough. But according to Mr Holt, the process needs to be accelerated, so that they can get the money quickly. He says further measures will be needed as well, including a holiday from National Insurance payments and business rates. A further concern is that these businesses are ineligible for the help offered by the government to struggling businesses under emergency schemes, because the four companies do not meet the right criteria. They have asked for those criteria to be relaxed. The government, meanwhile, insists that the aviation sector is important to the UK economy, and can draw on an unprecedented range of measures designed to help companies through the crisis.

"This video can not be played The US president launched a scathing attack on a CNN journalist Donald Trump has said the US will be in ""a very good shape"" in terms of the number of ventilators available by the time the coronavirus outbreak peaks. The president said at least 10 US companies were now making the medical devices, and some might be exported. The virus can cause severe respiratory issues, and ventilators help keep patients breathing. However, several state and local officials have warned hospitals are at risk of running out of equipment. Governor Phil Murphy of New Jersey, the US state with the second-highest number of cases, was the latest to raise the alarm, saying the ""need [was] dire"". ""We need more ventilators... This is real life. This is life and death,"" he said on Twitter. Trump extends US virus guidelines to end of April Trump backs away from New York 'quarantine' What this crisis reveals about the US The US has more than 163,000 confirmed virus cases and over 3,000 deaths. On Monday, officials announced 540 new deaths in a 24-hour period, the deadliest day yet in the country. New York City is the worst-hit place in the US, with 914 confirmed fatalities, according to Johns Hopkins University. The US last week became the country with the most reported cases, ahead of Italy and China. Speaking at Monday's Coronavirus Task Force briefing at the White House, Mr Trump said: ""We have now 10 companies at least making the ventilators, and we say go ahead because, honestly, other countries - they'll never be able to do it."" Asked whether there would be enough ventilators for all patients in the US who needed them during a predicted peak in infections in two weeks' time, Mr Trump responded: ""I think we're going to be in a very good shape."" He said more than a million Americans had been tested for the virus, ""more than any other country by far. Not even close"". He accused a reporter who pointed out that South Korea had tested proportionally more people when measured by population size of negativity. He added that he should be congratulated on his administration's progress in fighting the virus. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate? STRESS:How to protect your mental health MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak Mr Trump also repeated his allegations that some US state governors were ""hoarding"" critical medical equipment, and that items including face masks were being stolen from hospitals. He gave no evidence for either claim. Mr Trump said ""challenging times are ahead for the next 30 days"", but that social distancing could save more than a million American lives. ""We will have a great victory,"" he added. Asked by a CNN correspondent whether his previous comments downplaying the threat of the outbreak were wrong, the president responded that they were ""all true"". ""I don't want panic in the country. I could cause panic much better than even you,"" he told the reporter. Mr Trump has been accused of slowness in implementing measures to stem the spread of the virus as he feared the economic impact could hurt his re-election prospects later this year. ""The economy is number two on my list, we're going to save a lot of lives,"" he insisted. Nationwide guidelines being implemented by many states say citizens must continue to avoid non-essential travel, going to work, and eating at restaurants or bars. Gatherings are limited to groups of under 10 people. But stricter restrictions apply to millions in some of the worst-hit states. This video can not be played Why staying at home in is a matter of life and death On Saturday residents of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut were advised not to travel elsewhere within the country for 14 days. Non-essential gatherings in New York City are banned and most businesses are closed as the city faces more than 33,000 cases. Police can issue fines of $250-500 (Â£200-Â£400). In California, a ""shelter in place"" order remains. The availability of ventilators is a major concern among health professionals as demand has surged. A number of states and cities have warned that they will soon not have enough to treat patients suffering from Covid-19. Last week,New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said key medical supplies could run outat the start of April. Warning have also been made by governors Andrew Cuomo, of New York, and John Bel Edwards, of Louisiana. Earlier on Sunday, Mr Trump accused hospitals in some states of ""hoarding"" ventilators, face masks and other critical medical supplies. ""We do have a problem with hoarding... including ventilators. Hospitals need to release them - in some cases they have too many, they have to release medical supplies and equipment,"" he said. Hospitals ""can't hold [ventilators] if they think there might be a problem weeks down the road"", he said, alleging that some were ""stocked up"".

A Lego fan and his partnerhave recreated the high street of his hometown in the UKas a way to pass the time during lockdown. Sean Power, who ten years ago moved to Toronto in Canada from Watford in Hertfordshire, said he thought ""well, why not"", when he embarked upon his month-long quest to pay homage to the place where he grew up. He said he wanted to include ""icons"" and ""lovely old buildings"" from the town's main thoroughfare. ""Jackson's jewellers, Clements and Monmouth House, and I think the flyover is a pretty unique feature... and we included the mini-market that's under it now.""

"People queueing outside a supermarket Aldi, Morrisons, Waitrose and Asda are easing restrictions on some of their products which were imposed in the wake of stockpiling earlier this month. All the major supermarkets restricted customers to buying fixed numbers of individual items to keep shelves full. Aldi is now scrapping limits completely on all but a few items, while Morrisons, Waitrose and Asda  have also removed some limits and changed others. Meanwhile, grocery sales in the UK were at record levels in March. Aldi customers will be able to buy as many as they want of most items in its stores. However, they will only be allowed to purchase four of some - including hand wash and soap, toilet roll, certain canned goods and alcohol - and  two of antibacterial hand gel, UHT milk and baby formula. Morrisons is upping the limits on some items from three to four per customer and removing some altogether to make it easier for people to donate to food banks. The supermarket will create local drop-off points for customers to donate products to others and will distribute Â£10m of food to food banks itself. How are supermarkets keeping customers safe? Supermarkets 'drastically' cutting product ranges Waitrose is removing its cap on all fresh food, so meat, fish, poultry and other fresh goods can now be purchased freely along with fruit and vegetables. Alcohol and Easter confectionery are also not subject to limits, although restrictions do remain on certain items. Asda is removing limits on fruit and vegetables and chilled products. Tesco, Sainsbury's and Co-op are not changing their policies on restrictions at the moment. Meanwhile, figures from consumer analysts Kantar showed huge increases in shopping in the UK this month. The busiest spell was from 16-19 March, when 88% of households visited a food store, adding up to 42 million extra trips across four days. In the last four weeks, year-on-year supermarket sales grew by 20.6%. Kantar's Fraser McKevitt said Â£10.8bn sales in the past four weeks were ""even higher than levels seen at Christmas"". The figures have mainly risen because of people making extra shopping trips, rather than spending more on each visit. The average household spent an extra Â£62.92 during the past four weeks, equivalent to adding five days' worth of groceries. London had the biggest increase, with grocery spending up by 26% during the month. EASY STEPS:What can I do? CONTAINMENT:What it means to self-isolate UK LATEST:What's the UK's plan and what could happen next? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash Mr McKevitt added: ""It's inevitable that shoppers will add extra items to their baskets when faced with restrictions on their movement. ""With restaurants and cafes now closed, none of us can eat meals on the go any longer and an extra 503 million meals, mainly lunches and snacks, will be prepared and eaten at home every week for the foreseeable future."" Online grocery spending was 13% higher than in the same period last year. The average online basket cost Â£81.88, which was Â£6 more than in March 2019, while 14.6% of households received an online delivery - up from 13.8% at the same time last year. Sales of alcohol rose by 22% - an extra Â£199m. There was also a rise in spending for families with children over the age of 16, which is likely to be down to the youngsters returning early from college or university. Those families spent Â£508 on average on groceries in March, Â£88.13 more than they did in the same month last year. Supermarket spending data from analysts Nielsen showed that in the week ending 21 March, many shoppers had filled their cupboards and instead were deciding to stock up the freezer. Its figures showed that sales of frozen food that week rose by 84% compared with the same period last year. Nielsen's Mike Watkins said there had been a ""seismic shift in overall shopping patterns"". He added: ""Unlike stores, there is a finite capacity for online grocery shopping, due to warehouse capacity and available delivery slots, and this will have limited the growth of online sales."" Online deliveries have been a sticking point for many people, who have found themselves unable to book slots and followPrime Minister Boris Johnson's request to use online deliveriesand stay at home. Tesco, which last weeklimited online orders to 80 items only,has now expanded its home delivery and click and collect services to about 780,000 slots this week - up from 660,000 two weeks ago. It has plans to add another 100,000 slots in the coming weeks. It has also recruited more than 7,500 staff and added more than 200 new vans to its fleet. Asda is also recruiting more delivery drivers, while Sainsbury's has introduced priority slots for elderly and vulnerable customers and is contacting eligible customers on its database. Morrisons is creating 3,500 new jobs to help expand its online delivery service, while Waitrose says it will set aside at least a quarter of its delivery slots to elderly or vulnerable people and is working to identify eligible customers.

"This video can not be played The US president launched a scathing attack on a CNN journalist Donald Trump has said the US will be in ""a very good shape"" in terms of the number of ventilators available by the time the coronavirus outbreak peaks. The president said at least 10 US companies were now making the medical devices, and some might be exported. The virus can cause severe respiratory issues, and ventilators help keep patients breathing. However, several state and local officials have warned hospitals are at risk of running out of equipment. Governor Phil Murphy of New Jersey, the US state with the second-highest number of cases, was the latest to raise the alarm, saying the ""need [was] dire"". ""We need more ventilators... This is real life. This is life and death,"" he said on Twitter. Trump extends US virus guidelines to end of April Trump backs away from New York 'quarantine' What this crisis reveals about the US The US has more than 163,000 confirmed virus cases and over 3,000 deaths. On Monday, officials announced 540 new deaths in a 24-hour period, the deadliest day yet in the country. New York City is the worst-hit place in the US, with 914 confirmed fatalities, according to Johns Hopkins University. The US last week became the country with the most reported cases, ahead of Italy and China. Speaking at Monday's Coronavirus Task Force briefing at the White House, Mr Trump said: ""We have now 10 companies at least making the ventilators, and we say go ahead because, honestly, other countries - they'll never be able to do it."" Asked whether there would be enough ventilators for all patients in the US who needed them during a predicted peak in infections in two weeks' time, Mr Trump responded: ""I think we're going to be in a very good shape."" He said more than a million Americans had been tested for the virus, ""more than any other country by far. Not even close"". He accused a reporter who pointed out that South Korea had tested proportionally more people when measured by population size of negativity. He added that he should be congratulated on his administration's progress in fighting the virus. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate? STRESS:How to protect your mental health MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak Mr Trump also repeated his allegations that some US state governors were ""hoarding"" critical medical equipment, and that items including face masks were being stolen from hospitals. He gave no evidence for either claim. Mr Trump said ""challenging times are ahead for the next 30 days"", but that social distancing could save more than a million American lives. ""We will have a great victory,"" he added. Asked by a CNN correspondent whether his previous comments downplaying the threat of the outbreak were wrong, the president responded that they were ""all true"". ""I don't want panic in the country. I could cause panic much better than even you,"" he told the reporter. Mr Trump has been accused of slowness in implementing measures to stem the spread of the virus as he feared the economic impact could hurt his re-election prospects later this year. ""The economy is number two on my list, we're going to save a lot of lives,"" he insisted. Nationwide guidelines being implemented by many states say citizens must continue to avoid non-essential travel, going to work, and eating at restaurants or bars. Gatherings are limited to groups of under 10 people. But stricter restrictions apply to millions in some of the worst-hit states. This video can not be played Why staying at home in is a matter of life and death On Saturday residents of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut were advised not to travel elsewhere within the country for 14 days. Non-essential gatherings in New York City are banned and most businesses are closed as the city faces more than 33,000 cases. Police can issue fines of $250-500 (Â£200-Â£400). In California, a ""shelter in place"" order remains. The availability of ventilators is a major concern among health professionals as demand has surged. A number of states and cities have warned that they will soon not have enough to treat patients suffering from Covid-19. Last week,New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said key medical supplies could run outat the start of April. Warning have also been made by governors Andrew Cuomo, of New York, and John Bel Edwards, of Louisiana. Earlier on Sunday, Mr Trump accused hospitals in some states of ""hoarding"" ventilators, face masks and other critical medical supplies. ""We do have a problem with hoarding... including ventilators. Hospitals need to release them - in some cases they have too many, they have to release medical supplies and equipment,"" he said.

"The four companies which manage ground operations at UK airports have warned that they are close to collapse, putting thousands of jobs at risk. Swissport, Worldwide Flight Services, Dnata and Menzies may not be able to continue operating for more than a few weeks, putting 25,000 jobs at risk. In a joint letter, they called for urgent assistance from the government. With most passenger flights suspended amid the coronavirus pandemic, their revenues have taken a hit. In the letter addressed to the chancellor, they said: ""We have all been able to weather previous crises, whether 9/11, Sars or the Icelandic volcanic eruption, but Covid-19 is different, as it is both global and longer-term."" The firms provide 90% of airport handling services across the country, and say that airports could have to close if they collapse. They warned that without their services, ""the airport infrastructure in the UK would grind to a halt for up to four months"". Between them, these four companies manage nearly all of the ground handling operations required by airlines at the UK's airports. They include refuelling, cleaning, baggage transfer, departure gate services and the loading and unloading of cargo. They do not work for the airports themselves, but are directly contracted by the airlines. They operate on a ""pay-as-you-go"" basis, charging for each service they provide. However, airlines are cutting their passenger operations right back due to travel restrictions around the world associated with the coronavirus pandemic. Cargo operations are continuing, and indeed some aircraft that would normally carry passengers have been operating as ""ghost flights"", simply to transport freight. But even that source of revenue is beginning to decline. As a result, the ground handlers say that they have lost 95% of their revenues over the past few weeks. According to Swissport's boss in Western Europe, Jason Holt, without immediate government support, the sector is ""perilously close to collapse"". If ground handlers were to go into administration, he claims, airports would simply be unable to operate. ""The aviation system is a triangle of airlines, airports and ground handling businesses"", he says. ""Without cargo and ground handling companies, international supply chains will stop functioning during the Covid-19 pandemic and recovery."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do i protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak His concerns are shared by the airports themselves, according to Henk van Klaveren, spokesman for the Airport Operators Association. ""It is a very serious issue, particularly for smaller airports where there is only one ground handling operator"", he says. ""These airports still need to operate, even with fewer flights. There's essential cargo, flights to isolated regions and so on."" The worry within the industry is that while the airlines themselves enjoy a high profile - and the political clout that goes with it - ground handling services operate far below the radar, but need help more urgently. As one executive put it, ""no one will see us quietly expire."" The four companies have welcomed Chancellor Rishi Sunak's job retention scheme, under which a government grant will help to cover the wages of employees who have to be put on furlough. But according to Mr Holt, the process needs to be accelerated, so that they can get the money quickly. He says further measures will be needed as well, including a holiday from National Insurance payments and business rates. A further concern is that these businesses are ineligible for the help offered by the government to struggling businesses under emergency schemes, because the four companies do not meet the right criteria. They have asked for those criteria to be relaxed. The government, meanwhile, insists that the aviation sector is important to the UK economy, and can draw on an unprecedented range of measures designed to help companies through the crisis.

"The EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier has contracted coronavirus Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been urged by a group of MEPs to delay his Brexit deadline as countries around the world battle the coronavirus. The European Parliamentâs largest group of MEPs said the pandemic puts pressure on the chance of securing a trade deal by the planned date. The PMâs spokesman insisted there were no plans to change the timetable. It comes as EU and UK representatives met to discuss implementing the Brexit withdrawal agreement over video link. Under the agreement, the UK enters a transition period where it will continue to follow EU rules until 31 December 2020, by which time both sides say they hope to have agreed a trade deal. Brexit talks: Differences clear after a week Full UK-EU deal 'impossible' by deadline What to expect from UK-EU talks Downing Street said the talks to agree a deal are continuing to take place over the phone, amid the coronavirus outbreak. The EUâs chief negotiator Michel Barnier has contracted the disease, and his opposite UK number David Frost has had to self-isolate. The European Peopleâs Party MEP Christophe Hansen, a negotiator on the parliament's international trade committee, said: ""Under these extraordinary circumstances, I cannot see how the UK government would choose to expose itself to the double whammy of the coronavirus and the exit from the EU single market, which will inevitably add to the disruption, deal or no deal. ""I can only hope that common sense and substance will prevail over ideology. ""An extension of the transition period is the only responsible thing to do."" And the German MEP David McAlister said: ""The coronavirus pandemic complicates the already very ambitious schedule. ""The EU has always been open to extending the transition period - the ball is now clearly in the British court.â The European Parliament will get a say in ratifying any future trade deal. When asked if an extension was possible, the prime ministerâs spokesman said: ""The transition period ends on December 31 2020. This is enshrined in UK law."" The UK has also held a meeting with the European Commission to talk about implementing the withdrawal agreement. Following the meeting between European Commission Vice-President Maros Sefcovic and UK senior minister Michael Gove, a commission statement said that âthe proper and timely implementation of the withdrawal agreement is a key priority for the EU"". It added: âThis concerns in particular safeguarding the rights of around 4.5 million EU citizens and UK nationals, and maintaining peace and stability on the island of Ireland in the context of the Good Friday Agreement, while ensuring the integrity of the single market.â The statement also said both sides had âagreed on the importance for the UK to set out its plans over the coming months with regard to the implementation of the protocol on Ireland/Northern Irelandâ. It said there was ""an urgent need to present a detailed timetable and proceed with the necessary measures, such as preparing for the introduction of customs procedures for goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain.â Under the Brexit deal reached in 2019, Northern Ireland will continue to follow EU rules on agricultural and manufactured goods. The rest of the UK will stop following these rules at the end of 2020.

"American Airlines has confirmed it will seek $12bn (Â£9.7bn) of financial support from the US government because of the impact of coronavirus. Employees were told in an email this ""would allow us to fly through even the worst of potential future scenarios"". It said it would mean ""no involuntary furloughs or cuts in pay rates or benefits for the next six months"". Staff will also be offered ""enhanced voluntary leave and early retirement options"". Last year the company made a $2.9bn profit and returned $1.3bn to shareholders via dividends and buybacks, according to Bloomberg. Coronavirus: Airlines âentering danger zoneâ US airlines used up spare cash buying back shares Rescue flights for stranded Britons Under the massive $2.2tn coronavirus relief bill passed by the US Congress last week, $50bn was set aside for airlines with half given as grants. The other half will be offered as loans in exchange for not furloughing employees until at least 30 September. American Airlines, the world's biggest by passenger numbers, said it hoped to be back to flying a full schedule by then. ""These funds are being distributed to ensure continuation of essential airline service and protect jobs. We intend to apply for these funds and are confident that, along with our relatively high available cash position, they will allow us to fly through even the worst of potential future scenarios,"" said the email to staff from chief executive Doug Parker and president Robert Isom. Global airlines have struggled as countries worldwide have grounded the majority of passenger flights since February as part of efforts to halt the spread of the coronavirus. Another US airline, Delta, has also offered voluntary leave of absence, and carriers outside the US such as Singapore Airlines have unveiled plans to raise funds by tapping share and debt markets with the backing of sovereign investment fund Temasek Holdings.

"The EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier has contracted coronavirus Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been urged by a group of MEPs to delay his Brexit deadline as countries around the world battle the coronavirus. The European Parliamentâs largest group of MEPs said the pandemic puts pressure on the chance of securing a trade deal by the planned date. The PMâs spokesman insisted there were no plans to change the timetable. It comes as EU and UK representatives met to discuss implementing the Brexit withdrawal agreement over video link. Under the agreement, the UK enters a transition period where it will continue to follow EU rules until 31 December 2020, by which time both sides say they hope to have agreed a trade deal. Brexit talks: Differences clear after a week Full UK-EU deal 'impossible' by deadline What to expect from UK-EU talks Downing Street said the talks to agree a deal are continuing to take place over the phone, amid the coronavirus outbreak. The EUâs chief negotiator Michel Barnier has contracted the disease, and his opposite UK number David Frost has had to self-isolate. The European Peopleâs Party MEP Christophe Hansen, a negotiator on the parliament's international trade committee, said: ""Under these extraordinary circumstances, I cannot see how the UK government would choose to expose itself to the double whammy of the coronavirus and the exit from the EU single market, which will inevitably add to the disruption, deal or no deal. ""I can only hope that common sense and substance will prevail over ideology. ""An extension of the transition period is the only responsible thing to do."" And the German MEP David McAlister said: ""The coronavirus pandemic complicates the already very ambitious schedule. ""The EU has always been open to extending the transition period - the ball is now clearly in the British court.â The European Parliament will get a say in ratifying any future trade deal. When asked if an extension was possible, the prime ministerâs spokesman said: ""The transition period ends on December 31 2020. This is enshrined in UK law."" The UK has also held a meeting with the European Commission to talk about implementing the withdrawal agreement. Following the meeting between European Commission Vice-President Maros Sefcovic and UK senior minister Michael Gove, a commission statement said that âthe proper and timely implementation of the withdrawal agreement is a key priority for the EU"". It added: âThis concerns in particular safeguarding the rights of around 4.5 million EU citizens and UK nationals, and maintaining peace and stability on the island of Ireland in the context of the Good Friday Agreement, while ensuring the integrity of the single market.â The statement also said both sides had âagreed on the importance for the UK to set out its plans over the coming months with regard to the implementation of the protocol on Ireland/Northern Irelandâ. It said there was ""an urgent need to present a detailed timetable and proceed with the necessary measures, such as preparing for the introduction of customs procedures for goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain.â Under the Brexit deal reached in 2019, Northern Ireland will continue to follow EU rules on agricultural and manufactured goods. The rest of the UK will stop following these rules at the end of 2020.

"Tesco has been accused of a ""disproportionate"" response to the policy shift Tesco has been accused of ""whipping up a huge lobbying operation"" against a decision not to give its biggest stores in Wales financial help. The Welsh Government changed its mind on giving business rate relief to all retail, hospitality and leisure firms. BBC Wales has been told Tesco asked the government for an explanation of its thinking rather than a change in policy. Tesco said it had recruited 2,750 new staff in Wales during the outbreak. The relief will not now be given to the ""small proportion of properties"" with a rateable value of Â£500,000 and above. A Welsh Government source said Tesco had ""been using all channels to get us to overturn the decision"" and that ""it's been disproportionate"". A Tesco spokesman said: ""As Wales' largest retailer we are doing our utmost to support both our colleagues and customers through this time of significant uncertainty. ""We have now taken on 2,750 new colleagues in Wales to provide additional help, have given our frontline colleagues a 10% pay bonus, and have provided our vulnerable colleagues with paid leave for 12 weeks."" The policy change also affects the premises of around 50 companies, including Asda, Morrisons, the Celtic Manor Hotel, DFS, IKEA, and John Lewis. The policy change also affects the likes of Ikea in Wales It also means Bluestone holiday resort in Pembrokeshire and the Principality Stadium in Cardiff will continue to pay business rates. Bluestone is to be transformed into a recovery centre for people recovering from coronavirus, whilst thenational stadium of Wales is to be used as a field hospitalfor up to 2,000 beds during the outbreak. Speaking at the Welsh Government's daily press conference, Health Minister Vaughan Gething said a ""choice was made about those very large businesses and their ability to survive, and other smaller businesses who may have been much more hard pushed"". He also said ministers would look again at firms that were ""turning over their assets"" to help the fight against coronavirus to see ""how we provide support for them"", including Bluestone and the Principality Stadium. In a letter sent on Monday to the boss of Tesco Dave Lewis, the first minister said the Welsh Government faces ""extraordinarily difficult decisions"" because it has ""a finite budget and limited borrowing capacity both of which are effectively decided by the UK government"". Mark Drakeford explained in his letter that giving business rate relief to all premises in the retail, hospitality and leisure sectors ""would have cost the Welsh Government nearly Â£120 million"". Wales has a ""finite budget and limited borrowing capacity"", said Mr Drakeford On Monday, it was announced that the money will instead be used as part of aÂ£500m 'economic resilience fund'to help businesses, charities and social enterprises survive the coronavirus crisis. In the letter, Mr Drakeford also said it meant the Welsh Government was ""able to provide critically important grants"" of around Â£50,000 to 2,400 small and medium sized businesses. Businesses 'flouting coronavirus rules' on working What is the help for Welsh businesses? Wages, sick pay and time off explained He added: ""Given the nature of the Welsh economy, I am convinced that we have made the correct decision. ""In Wales, we will now be able to assist sectors with much less help otherwise available - companies in the manufacturing and other services sectors (for example, financial services, media and broadcasting). ""I know that you will acknowledge that, while Tesco are able to continue to trade, many of the businesses which we will now be able to help have had to suspend economic activity altogether."" Supermarkets have struggled to keep shelves stocked during the coronavirus pandemic On 18 March, Economy Minister Ken Skates said the Welsh Governmentwould match plans announced by UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak, including a business rate holiday for all firms in the retail, leisure and hospitality sectors for 12 months. But six days later, Mr Skates and Finance Minister Rebecca Evans said the Welsh Government had since decided tonot extend the 100% relief,externalto the small proportion of properties with a rateable value of Â£500,000 and above. The head of the business organisation CBI, Carolyn Fairbairn, welcomed news of an ""economic resilience fund"" but said failure to follow through on commitment to match England's approach on business rates was ""significant and damaging"" to Welsh retailers.

""With retail the lifeblood of many local economies, sustaining thousands of jobs across the nation, this volte-face on rates from the Welsh Government is both short sighted and damaging.

"Amazon has seen a spike in demand amid the coronavirus pandemic Amazon has fired a New York warehouse worker who organised a protest over the safety precautions taken by the firm to deal with the coronavirus pandemic. The fight comes as pressure builds on Amazon, and other delivery firms, to improve protection for workers worried about getting infected with the virus. The firing of the worker prompted a rebuke by the state's attorney general, who called for an investigation into whether it violated worker rights. Amazon defended the action. It said the worker, Christian Smalls, had received a warning about social distancing rules and was supposed to stay home after coming in contact with an infected colleague. ""Despite that instruction to stay home with pay, he came onsite ... further putting the teams at risk,"" a spokesperson said, adding that just 15 of the more than 5,000 people who work at the New York facility participated in the protest. New York state's attorney general, Letitia James, said her office was considering ""all legal options"" regarding Mr Smalls' firing. ""It is disgraceful that Amazon would terminate an employee who bravely stood up to protect himself and his colleagues,"" she said. ""At a time when so many New Yorkers are struggling and are deeply concerned about their safety, this action was also immoral and inhumane."" Amazon's practices are under scrutiny, as the number of reported coronavirus cases at its facilities increases, while demand for its services booms due to lockdowns across the world. A group of workers at the Whole Foods supermarket chain, which is owned by Amazon, planned to walk out on Tuesday. Amazon also faced earlier strikes from workers in France and Italy and has been hit by legal complaints over safety concerns in Spain,according to a global alliance of unions,externalcoordinated by UNI Global Union. US lawmakers have also written to Amazon boss Jeff Bezos to express concerns over shortages of protective and cleaning supplies, as well as its sick leave policies. Amazon has said it is taking extra precautions, including increased cleaning of its facilities and introducing staggered shift and break times to reduce staff contact. The company, which is looking to hire 100,000 more warehouse workers in the US to help address the surge in orders, has also said it would boost pay for warehouse staff around the world, including by $2 per hour in the US and by Â£2 per hour in the UK, where staff have been told to work overtime. In Italy, the company said it had reduced deliveries since 22 March. However, union leaders say workers need access to better protection. ""Several employees working at the site use face masks for days instead of having new ones each day,"" one union representative told Reuters. Amazon wants to hire 100,000 more warehouse workers in the US Earlier this month, Mr Bezos - who is one of the world's richest peoplewith an estimated $115.6bn fortune,external- addressed the worries inan open letter,externalto staff, thanking them for their work. However, the company has a reputation for pushing back against workers who try to unionise and taking a hard line against workers who speak out publicly. Last year, the company also faced criticism for cutting healthcare benefits for 1,900 part-time employees. Amazon is not the only delivery firm facing unrest. US food delivery firm Instacart,externalwas accused of profiting by putting people making its deliveries ""directly in harm's way"" by the Instacart Shoppers and Gig Workers Collective, which called for a strike on Monday. The organisation said the firm should provide protective gear, offer hazard pay and extend the pay for those unable to work because of the virus, whether due to a required quarantine or pre-existing condition. Instacart on Monday said it had seen ""absolutely no impact"" on operations, with more people picking and delivering groceries for its platform than ever before. It said it respected the right of shoppers to provide feedback and pointed to earlier changes it had announced aimed at improving working conditions. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do i protect myself?

"Police officers from North Yorkshire Police stop motorists in cars to check that their travel is ""essential"" People are heeding the advice to stay at home to keep pressure off the NHS, and there are early signs that it is working, the UK's chief scientific adviser has said. Sir Patrick Vallance told a news conference that social distancing measures are ""making a difference"". Transmission of coronavirus in the community is thought to be decreasing, which could mean fewer infections. Hospital admissions data suggests cases are not rising as fast as feared. There are currently 9,000 people in hospitals in England with coronavirus, up from 6,000 on Friday. This amounts to about one in ten of all hospital beds in the country. The latest number of deaths announced in the UK of people with the virus has reached 1,408. The deaths include a further 159 people in England, six in Scotland, 14 in Wales and one in Northern Ireland. Sir Patrick said the NHS was seeing around an additional 1,000 patients a day and described this daily rise as ""stable"". ""That shows that it's going up not in an increasing amount but in a constant amount, which may suggest that we're already beginning to see some effect,"" he said. After the daily number of deaths fell for the second day, he also cautioned against paying ""too much attention"" to day-to-day fluctuations in figures, explaining ""we need to look over time and see what's happening"". A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash Of the 1,000-a-day rise in hospital patients, he told reporters at the daily briefing: ""I do expect that number to continue. I expect people coming every day to be about that, it may go up a little bit. ""And in two or three weeks you would expect that to stabilise and to start to go down a bit."" He said the figures suggested the UK was ""not on a fast acceleration"" - but warned that ""we expect this to get worse"" over the next couple of weeks because of the ""lag"" in social distancing measures taking effect. He said it was ""premature"" to put a timescale on how long social distancing measures would need to be in place. He said instead the focus needed to be on making sure hospital admissions were not accelerating above a level that the NHS could cope with. Among those who have died was 55-year-old ear, nose and throat consultantAmged El-Hawraniwho died at Glenfield Hospital in Leicester, on Saturday. His death follows that ofan organ transplant consultantlast week, who became the first working NHS surgeon to die after testing positive for the virus. Mr El-Hawrani's brotherpaid tribute to him on Monday as a hero- ""just like every doctor and every nurse and anyone working at the NHS"". He added that his brother ""would have been heavily exposed"" to the virus. ""He worked so hard, both private and NHS, at many hospitals. He saw hundreds and hundreds of patients. We don't know how many patients he was exposed to."" By Robert Cuffe, head of statistics, BBC News There is a glimmer of hope in these figures: had deaths continued to grow at that recent daily rate of roughly a third a day, we might have expected to see 350 new deaths on Sunday and 450 today. Instead, we've seen slight falls: 260 deaths on Saturday, 209 on Sunday and a further fall to 180 today. But we shouldn't get carried away too soon: last week's Sunday-into-Monday figures also showed slight dips on the previous Saturday. But by Tuesday, they resumed the upward march. It's still too soon to know whether this is a real ray of hope, a blip caused by different working practices at the weekend or some mixture of the two. Special hospitals are being set up in Birmingham, Manchester, Glasgow, Cardiff and London, where a new Nightingale hospital with 4,000 to 5,000 beds has been set up at the ExCel Centre. It will start receiving its first patients this week. Around one in four doctors are off work at the moment either with symptoms or isolating because family members have symptoms, the head of the Royal College of Physicians estimated. BBC health editor Hugh Pym said: ""You talk to people on the front line and there is intense pressure. Staffing is a problem... they say it's very, very difficult, particularly in London. The situation for staffing is getting worse in Birmingham, and as one source put it - normal wards are turning into Covid wards. ""So you can build new hospitals, bring back volunteers - people who've retired, nurses and doctors, and so on - but staffing them, I think, is going to be an issue."" In other developments, the Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has announcedmeasures to help Britons stranded abroad. Airlines including BA, Virgin and easyJet will work with the government to help fly tens of thousands of Britons back to the UK. Mr Raab said the Foreign Office has also set aside Â£75m to charter special flights where commercial ones are unavailable. Elsewhere, Clarence House confirmedthe Prince of Wales is now out of self-isolation, following his diagnosis of coronavirus last week. A palace official said Prince Charles, 71, was in good health. In a video posted online on Sunday,Prime Minister Boris Johnson saidthe public appeared to be obeying the restrictions set out by government to slow the spread of the virus, adding that train use was down 95% and bus use down 75%. The prime minister also confirmed 20,000 former NHS staff have returned to work to help deal with the coronavirus outbreak, adding the country would get through the crisis ""together"".

"This video can not be played The US president launched a scathing attack on a CNN journalist Donald Trump has said the US will be in ""a very good shape"" in terms of the number of ventilators available by the time the coronavirus outbreak peaks. The president said at least 10 US companies were now making the medical devices, and some might be exported. The virus can cause severe respiratory issues, and ventilators help keep patients breathing. However, several state and local officials have warned hospitals are at risk of running out of equipment. Governor Phil Murphy of New Jersey, the US state with the second-highest number of cases, was the latest to raise the alarm, saying the ""need [was] dire"". ""We need more ventilators... This is real life. This is life and death,"" he said on Twitter. Trump extends US virus guidelines to end of April Trump backs away from New York 'quarantine' What this crisis reveals about the US The US has more than 163,000 confirmed virus cases and over 3,000 deaths. On Monday, officials announced 540 new deaths in a 24-hour period, the deadliest day yet in the country. New York City is the worst-hit place in the US, with 914 confirmed fatalities, according to Johns Hopkins University. The US last week became the country with the most reported cases, ahead of Italy and China. Speaking at Monday's Coronavirus Task Force briefing at the White House, Mr Trump said: ""We have now 10 companies at least making the ventilators, and we say go ahead because, honestly, other countries - they'll never be able to do it."" Asked whether there would be enough ventilators for all patients in the US who needed them during a predicted peak in infections in two weeks' time, Mr Trump responded: ""I think we're going to be in a very good shape."" He said more than a million Americans had been tested for the virus, ""more than any other country by far. Not even close"". He accused a reporter who pointed out that South Korea had tested proportionally more people when measured by population size of negativity. He added that he should be congratulated on his administration's progress in fighting the virus. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate? STRESS:How to protect your mental health MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak Mr Trump also repeated his allegations that some US state governors were ""hoarding"" critical medical equipment, and that items including face masks were being stolen from hospitals. He gave no evidence for either claim. Mr Trump said ""challenging times are ahead for the next 30 days"", but that social distancing could save more than a million American lives. ""We will have a great victory,"" he added. Asked by a CNN correspondent whether his previous comments downplaying the threat of the outbreak were wrong, the president responded that they were ""all true"". ""I don't want panic in the country. I could cause panic much better than even you,"" he told the reporter. Mr Trump has been accused of slowness in implementing measures to stem the spread of the virus as he feared the economic impact could hurt his re-election prospects later this year.

"This video can not be played The US president launched a scathing attack on a CNN journalist Donald Trump has said the US will be in ""a very good shape"" in terms of the number of ventilators available by the time the coronavirus outbreak peaks. The president said at least 10 US companies were now making the medical devices, and some might be exported. The virus can cause severe respiratory issues, and ventilators help keep patients breathing. However, several state and local officials have warned hospitals are at risk of running out of equipment. Governor Phil Murphy of New Jersey, the US state with the second-highest number of cases, was the latest to raise the alarm, saying the ""need [was] dire"". ""We need more ventilators... This is real life. This is life and death,"" he said on Twitter. Trump extends US virus guidelines to end of April Trump backs away from New York 'quarantine' What this crisis reveals about the US The US has more than 163,000 confirmed virus cases and over 3,000 deaths. On Monday, officials announced 540 new deaths in a 24-hour period, the deadliest day yet in the country. New York City is the worst-hit place in the US, with 914 confirmed fatalities, according to Johns Hopkins University. The US last week became the country with the most reported cases, ahead of Italy and China. Speaking at Monday's Coronavirus Task Force briefing at the White House, Mr Trump said: ""We have now 10 companies at least making the ventilators, and we say go ahead because, honestly, other countries - they'll never be able to do it."" Asked whether there would be enough ventilators for all patients in the US who needed them during a predicted peak in infections in two weeks' time, Mr Trump responded: ""I think we're going to be in a very good shape."" He said more than a million Americans had been tested for the virus, ""more than any other country by far. Not even close"". He accused a reporter who pointed out that South Korea had tested proportionally more people when measured by population size of negativity. He added that he should be congratulated on his administration's progress in fighting the virus. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate? STRESS:How to protect your mental health MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak Mr Trump also repeated his allegations that some US state governors were ""hoarding"" critical medical equipment, and that items including face masks were being stolen from hospitals. He gave no evidence for either claim. Mr Trump said ""challenging times are ahead for the next 30 days"", but that social distancing could save more than a million American lives.

"Ministers are responding to fears that children on free school meals could go hungry Families with children eligible for free school meals in England will be able to claim weekly shopping vouchers while schools are closed due to the coronavirus outbreak, say ministers. The scheme will allow schools to issue vouchers worth Â£15 a week per child. Headteachers have warned that even with the vouchers, some parents will struggle to feed their children. But the Department for Education says the rate exceeds that normally paid to schools for free school meals. Schools across the UK were forced to close earlier this month to all pupils, except the children of key workers such as doctors, nurses and supermarket delivery drivers, as well as some vulnerable children and those with more serious special educational needs. How schools and charities plan to feed children UK schools closed from Friday Around 1.3 million in children in England are entitled to free school meals and, until now, schools have been making their own arrangements. Schools will be able to continue to provide meals for collection or delivery themselves, but where this is not possible the voucher system will ensure children do not lose out. Schools will be able to order the voucher codes online from Tuesday, and ministers hope parents could start receiving them the same day. Families will be issued with either an electronic voucher or gift card worth Â£15, to spend at supermarkets including Sainsbury's, Asda, Tesco, Morrisons, Waitrose and M&S. ""No child should go hungry as a result of the measures introduced to keep people at home,"" said England's Education Secretary Gavin Williamson. In Scotland, the government has pledged that all children eligible for free school meals will still receive them through their local authorities The Welsh government is developing a national voucher scheme for children eligible for free school meals but - in the meantime - schools and local authorities are charged with continuing to provide meals throughout the Easter break In Northern Ireland, the government is introducing direct payments to families whose children normally get free school meals Headteachers' leaders welcomed the scheme although the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, Geoff Barton, warned that Â£3 a day would still leave families struggling, ""Let's be under no illusions, this will be a tough situation,"" said Mr Barton. ""It will be challenging for parents and carers who already have the extra cost of children unexpectedly at home for an extended period."" Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, added: ""There may be some kinks to work out of the scheme, especially as it has been developed at pace, but at least there is some certainty available now."" Mr Whiteman said heads would work with government to make sure the scheme worked as effectively as possible. The government says the value of the vouchers, which exceeds the rate paid to schools for free school meals, recognises the fact that families will not be able to buy food in bulk, and could incur higher costs.

"This video can not be played Dominic Raab said charter flights will be arranged for countries where commercial flights have stopped. Tens of thousands of Britons stranded abroad by the coronavirus pandemic will be flown home under a new arrangement between the government and airlines. BA, Virgin and Easyjet are among airlines working with the government to fly Britons back to the UK. The government has also pledged Â£75m to charter special flights to bring home UK nationals from countries where commercial flights are unavailable. The number of people who have died with the virus in the UKhas reached 1,408. Speaking at the government's daily coronavirus briefing, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said an ""unprecedented"" number of UK travellers were trying to get home ""from young backpackers to retired couples on cruises"". ""We are talking about hundreds of thousands of people travelling around the world,"" he said. Under the new arrangement, airlines would be responsible for getting stranded passengers home where commercial routes remain an option. Where commercial routes do not exist, government financial support will enable special charter flights - operated by the partner airlines and others - to fly to priority countries to bring back UK residents. Mr Raab said priority would be given to the most vulnerable - including the elderly or those with pressing medical needs - and also to countries where there are large numbers of British tourists trying to return to the UK. Labour's shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry criticised the plans as ""just more of the same"", and called for ""a fresh, comprehensive and fully-funded strategy to bring our British nationals home"". A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash Outlining the partnership, Mr Raab said airlines should offer alternative flights ""at little to no cost where routes have been cancelled"" and allow passengers to change tickets - including between carriers. He added: ""So for those still in those countries where commercial options are still available: don't wait. Don't run the risk of getting stranded. ""The airlines are standing by to help you - please book your tickets as soon as possible."" Virgin, easyJet, Jet2 and Titan Airways signed a memorandum of understanding relating to the arrangement on Monday, while British Airways has also said it will work with government to get people home. Other airlines are expected to join the new arrangement, Mr Raab said. June and Leslie Webb, both 77-years-old with underlying health conditions, are trying to return to Southend, Essex, from Goa, western India. The couple were due to return to Britain on Monday after a two-and-a-half week trip, but their flight was cancelled after India declared a 21-day lockdown on 24 March. They have since booked a non-refundable Â£700 flight for 2 April, which was also cancelled, their daughter-in-law Sally Webb told BBC News. ""My mother-in-law is in remission from cancer and my father-in-law is diabetic,"" Mrs Webb said. ""The situation is getting desperate."" She added that the couple had about a week's worth of medication left and were reporting food shortages where they were staying. Mrs Webb has been working with her sister-in-law to get them home, but said the government briefing was ""the first bit"" of information they had received about repatriation efforts. ""It doesn't give us a lot of hope because obviously India is on lockdown,"" she said. ""The fact is that even if the UK are able to get the Indian government to release the lockdown, they have got to get all of the other Brits as well as our in-laws home. ""We just want a flight, any flight and we want them home safe."" Mrs Webb added that she would like further details about how long it would take to get a flight, ""just so I could give my in laws some reassurance"". Speaking to BBC News following the daily briefing, Ms Thornberry said she was ""disappointed"" that there was not more detail and that some questions ""simply hadn't been addressed"". ""What happens if your insurance has run out whilst you are waiting to get on a flight, what happens if your food or your medicine is running out - there aren't any specific answers to that,"" she said. Ms Thornberry added that she had received ""worrying"" emails from British people around the world about commercial flights, including one family of six who had been told it would cost Â£61,000 to get them home from Australia to Yorkshire. ""That's simply unacceptable,"" she said. Instructions for UK travellers to return home can be found on the government'sforeign travel advice website,external. The Foreign Office said it has already helped hundreds of thousands of British tourists return from around the globe including 8,500 from Morocco, about 5,000 from Cyprus, and an estimated 150,000 from Spain. From the moment countries started closing their borders, it only felt like a matter of time until the government had to step in in a more concrete way to get a vast number of stranded British people home. Up until now, the Foreign Office has been pressuring countries to lift travel restrictions and co-ordinating with UK airlines that have been running empty planes out to destinations to bring people home. It was a commercial operation and it worked up until a point. But with so many people stuck in all corners of the globe, and anger growing among many who found themselves in precarious situations, the government ultimately had to provide funding to ensure a more extensive repatriation programme was possible. Airlines are in dire financial straits and Â£75m is, in aviation terms, a relatively small sum. But by helping government now, they'll be hoping government helps them through this crisis and beyond. Later in the news briefing, the UK's chief scientific adviser said there were early signs that social distancing measures in the UKwere ""making a difference"". Sir Patrick Vallance said people were heeding the advice to stay at home to keep the pressure off the NHS. As of 09:00 BST on Monday, 22,141 people in the UK have tested positive for coronavirus, while 112,805 have tested negative, according to the Department of Health. The total number of people who have died with the virus in the UK reached 1,408, as measured before 17:00 BST on Sunday. The deaths include a further 159 people in England, six in Scotland, 14 in Wales and one in Northern Ireland. There are currently 9,000 people in hospitals in England with coronavirus, up from 6,000 on Friday. The Brits stranded abroad due to coronavirus Why are Brits abroad struggling to get home?
